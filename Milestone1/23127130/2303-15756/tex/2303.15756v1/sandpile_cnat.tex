\begin{abstract}
We study a link between complete non-ambiguous trees (CNATs) and permutations exhibited by Daniel Chen and Sebastian Ohlig in recent work. In this, they associate a certain permutation to the leaves of a CNAT, and show that the number of $n$-permutations that are associated with exactly one CNAT is $2^{n-2}$. We connect this to work by the first author and co-authors linking complete non-ambiguous trees and the Abelian sandpile model. This allows us to prove a number of conjectures by Chen and Ohlig on the number of $n$-permutations that are associated with exactly $k$ CNATs for various $k > 1$, via bijective correspondences between such permutations. We also exhibit a new bijection between $(n-1)$-permutations and CNATs whose permutation is the decreasing permutation $n(n-1)\cdots1$. This bijection maps the left-to-right minima of the permutation to dots on the bottom row of the corresponding CNAT, and descents of the permutation to empty rows of the CNAT.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

Non-ambiguous trees (NATs) were originally introduced by Aval \textit{et al.}\ in~\cite{ABBS} as a special case of the tree-like tableaux from~\cite{ABN}. The combinatorial study of these objects was further developed in~\cite{ABDHL}, which included a generalisation of NATs to higher dimensions. In~\cite{DSSS2}, the authors described a multi-rooted generalisation of complete NATs (CNATs), and linked this to the so-called Abelian sandpile model (ASM), see Sections~\ref{subsec:asm_prelims}, \ref{subsec:minrec_prelims} and \ref{subsec:cnats_asm_prelims} for more details.

We can associate a permutation to a CNAT by keeping only its leaf dots (see Section~\ref{subsec:cnats_prelims}). This link between CNATs and permutations was first noted, to the best of our knowledge, in~\cite{DSSS2} (see Section~4 in that paper for more details). Chen and Ohlig~\cite{CO} initiated the first in-depth combinatorial study of this relationship. In particular, they characterised the set of permutations $\pi$ which are associated to a unique CNAT. More generally, they looked into the number of $n$-permutations with $k$ associated CNATs, for $k \geq 1$, and provided a number of conjectures on the enumeration of such permutations. They also studied in detail so-called \emph{upper-diagonal} CNATs, which are CNATs where the associated permutation is the decreasing permutation $n(n-1)\cdots1$, using these to prove a conjecture of Laborde-Zubieta on occupied corners of tree-like tableaux~\cite{Zub}. 

In this paper, we will further develop the study initiated in~\cite{CO}, using the aforementioned link to the ASM from~\cite{DSSS2}. In particular, we will see (Theorem~\ref{thm:cnat_minrec}) that the number of CNATs associated with a given permutation $\pi$ is equal to the number of \emph{minimal recurrent configurations} for the ASM on the \emph{permutation graph} $G_{\pi}$ of $\pi$. Minimal recurrent configurations are in natural bijection with certain acyclic orientations of the graph. The connection between CNATs and the ASM allows us to solve a number of conjectures in~\cite{CO}, via various bijective correspondences between permutations with a given number of CNATs. 

We also add to the study of upper-diagonal CNATs by providing a new bijection between upper-diagonal CNATs of size $n$ and permutations of length $n-1$ (see Theorem~\ref{thm:bij_cnat_perm}). This new bijection has the following added benefits. Firstly, it is direct, whereas the bijection in~\cite{CO} used intermediate objects called tiered trees (see~\cite{DGGS}). Secondly, it maps certain statistics of the upper-diagonal CNATs such as the number of top-row dots, or the number of empty rows, to well-known statistics of the corresponding permutation.

Our paper is organised as follows. In Section~\ref{sec:prelim}, we recall some necessary definitions of, and notation on, the combinatorial objects that will be considered in this paper. These include graphs, permutations, CNATs with associated permutations, and the ASM and its minimal recurrent configurations. We also show a number of useful preliminary results that will be useful in the remainder of the paper. At the end of the section we provide the key connection between CNATs and minimal recurrent configurations of the ASM (Theorem~\ref{thm:cnat_minrec}). In Section~\ref{sec:upper-diag}, we focus on one specific family of CNATs, called \emph{upper-diagonal CNATs}. We introduce a concept of \emph{labelled CNAT}, and describe a bijection between labelled CNATs and permutations of the label set (Theorem~\ref{thm:bij_cnat_perm}), which preserves certain statistics of both objects. This bijection then specialises to a bijection between upper-diagonal CNATs of size $n$ and permutations of length $n-1$. The bijection relies on two operations on labelled CNATs, called \emph{top-row decomposition} and \emph{top-row deletion}. 

In Section~\ref{sec:cnat_count}, we focus on counting permutations according to their number of associated CNATs. Specifically, for $k, n \geq 1$ we are interested in the set $B(n,k)$ of permutations of length $n$ which are associated with exactly $k$ CNATs. The study of these sets was initiated in~\cite{CO}, and we continue that work here by proving a number of conjectures left by the authors. We begin in Section~\ref{subsec:B(n,1)_B(n+1,2)} by giving characterisations of the sets $B(n,1)$ and $B(n,2)$ in terms of the so-called \emph{quadrant condition} (Definition~\ref{def:quad_cond}, Propositions~\ref{pro:B(n,1)_quadrants} and \ref{pro:B(n,2)_characterisation}). This allows us to describe a simple bijection between the product set $\{2, \cdots, n\} \times B(n,1)$ and $B(n+1,2)$ (Theorem~\ref{thm:Insert_B(n,1)toB(n+1,2)}), and deduce the enumerative formula for the latter (Corollary~\ref{cor:b(n,2)}). In Section~\ref{subsec:B(n,2)_B(n+1,3)} we use permutation \emph{patterns} to establish a bijection between the sets $B(n,2)$ and $B(n+1,3)$ (Theorem~\ref{thm:biject_B(n,2)toB(n+1,3)}). We then show in Section~\ref{subsec:B(n,5)} that the set $B(n,5)$ is always empty (Theorem~\ref{thm:b(n,5)=0}). Finally, in Section~\ref{subsec:max_b(n,k)} we consider the maximal value of $k$ such that $B(n,k)$ is non-empty. We show (Theorem~\ref{thm:max_b(n,k)}) that this is achieved for $k = (n-1)!$, and that the unique permutation in $B(n, (n-1)!)$ is precisely the decreasing permutation $n(n-1)\cdots 1$ whose CNATs were studied in detail in Section~\ref{sec:upper-diag}. We then conclude our paper with a brief summary of our results as well as some open problems and directions for future research (Section~\ref{sec:conc}).

\section{Preliminaries}\label{sec:prelim}

In this section we introduce the various objects that will be studied and used throughout the paper, alongside the necessary notation. We also state and prove a number of useful preliminary results.

\subsection{Graphs and orientations}\label{subsec:graphs_prelims}

Throughout this paper all graphs considered are finite, undirected, simple (i.e.\ no loops or multiple edges are allowed), and connected. For a graph $G$, we denote $V(G)$ and $E(G)$ its set of vertices and edges respectively, and write $G = (V(G), E(G))$. Two graphs $G = (V,E)$ and $G' = (V', E')$ are said to be \emph{isomorphic} if there exists a bijection $\phi : V \rightarrow V'$ such that for any vertices $v, w \in V$, we have $(v,w) \in E$ if, and only if, $(\phi(v), \phi(w)) \in E'$. For a vertex $v \in V(G)$, we write $\dgr[v]$ for the degree of $v$ (its number of neighbours in the graph). Given a subset $V' \subseteq V(G)$, the \emph{induced} subgraph on $V'$ is the graph with vertex set $V'$ and edge set consisting of all edges in $E$ whose end-points are both in $V'$. We denote it $G\left[V' \right]$.

A \emph{cycle} in the graph $G$ is a sequence of vertices $v_0, v_1, \cdots, v_n = v_0$ (for some $n \geq 3$) such that for every $i > 0$, $(v_{i-1}, v_i)$ is an edge of $G$, and the vertices $v_0, v_1, \cdots, v_{n-1}$ are all distinct. The integer $n$ is the \emph{length} of the cycle, and we will say that $G$ \emph{contains} a cycle of length $n$ (or $n$-cycle for short) if there exists such a cycle in $G$. The $n$-cycle (graph) $C_n$ is the graph consisting of a single cycle of length $n$, with no other vertices or edges. If $G$ contains a cycle $v_0, v_1, \cdots, v_n = v_0$ such that $G\left[ \{v_0, \cdots, v_{n-1}\} \right]$ is the $n$-cycle $C_n$, we say that $G$ \emph{induces} an $n$-cycle. A \emph{tree} is a (connected) graph containing no cycle of any length. A \emph{spanning tree} of a graph $G$ is a tree $G'$ such that $V(G') = V(G)$.

An \emph{orientation} $\OO$ of a graph $G$ is the assignment of a direction to each edge of $G$. Given an orientation $\OO$ of $G$, and an edge $(v,w)$, we write $v \orighta w$ to indicate that the edge is directed from $v$ to $w$ in the orientation $\OO$, and $v \olefta w$ when it is directed from $w$ to $v$. We also write $\In[v]$, resp.\ $\Out[v]$ for the number of incoming edges (edges $v \olefta w$), resp.\ outgoing edges (edges $v \orighta w$), at $v$ in the orientation $\OO$. A vertex $v$ is a \emph{target}, resp.\ \emph{source}, of an orientation $\OO$ if $\In[v] = \dgr[v]$ (all edges are incoming), resp.\ $\Out[v] = \dgr[v]$ (all edges are outgoing)\footnote{The terminology ``sink'' is more frequent than ``target'' in the literature. However, we will be considering the Abelian sandpile model on graphs, for which there is already a designated, fixed, sink vertex, so we use the latter terminology here to avoid confusion.}.

An orientation is \emph{acyclic} if it contains no directed cycle, i.e.\ there is no sequence $v_0, \cdots, v_{n-1}$ of vertices such that $v_0 \orighta v_1 \orighta \cdots \orighta v_{n-1} \orighta v_0$. It is straightforward to check that an acyclic orientation must have at least one source and at least one target. For $s \in V(G)$, we see that an acyclic orientation $\OO$ is \emph{$s$-rooted} if $s$ is the unique target of $\OO$. We denote by $\AO{s}{G}$ the set of $s$-rooted acyclic orientations of a graph $G$.

\subsection{Permutations, permutation patterns, and permutation graphs}\label{subsec:perms_prelims}

For $n \geq 1$, we let $S_n$ be the set of permutations of length $n$ (called $n$-permutations for short). We will usually use standard one-line notation for permutations. That is, a permutation $\pi \in S_n$ is a word $\pi = \pi_1 \cdots \pi_n$ on the alphabet $[n]$ such that every letter in $[n]$ appears exactly once in $\pi$. By convention, the unique $0$-permutation is simply the empty word. For $i,j \in [n], i \neq j$, we write $i \prec_{\pi} j$ if $i$ appears before (to the left of) $j$ in the permutation (word) $\pi$.

Another useful way of viewing permutations is their \emph{graphical representation}. In this view, an $n$-permutation is a set of dots in an $n \times n$ grid such that every row and every column of the grid contains exactly one dot. For a permutation $\pi = \pi_1 \cdots \pi_n$, we construct its graphical representation by putting dots in column $i$ and row $\pi_i$ for $i = 1, \cdots, n$. When connecting permutations to CNATs, it will be convenient to label columns from left-to-right and rows from top-to-bottom in this representation, as in Figure~\ref{fig:perm_graphical_repr} below.

\caption{Graphical representation of the permutation $\pi = 561243$.\label{fig:perm_graphical_repr}}
\end{figure}

A permutation $\pi = \pi_1 \cdots \pi_n$ is said to be \emph{reducible} if there exists $1 \leq k < n$ such that $\pi_1 \cdots \pi_k$ is a $k$-permutation. A permutation is \emph{irreducible} if it is not reducible. For example, the permutation $\textbf{312}564$ is reducible, while $561243$ is irreducible.\footnote{
The terminology of \emph{(in)decomposable} is also used sometimes in the literature instead of (ir)reducible.
}
A \emph{fixed point} of a permutation $\pi$ is an index $j \in [n]$ such that $\pi_j = j$. A \emph{left-to-right minimum} is a letter $\pi_i$ such that $\pi_j > \pi_i$ for all $j < i$. For example, the permutation $\textbf{5}6\textbf{1}243$ has two left-to-right minima $5$ and $1$.

Given a permutation $\pi$ and two letters $i,j \in [n]$, we say that $(i,j)$ is an \emph{inversion} of $\pi$ if $i > j$ and $i \prec_{\pi} j$. A \emph{descent} of $\pi$ is an inversion consisting of consecutive letters in the word, that is $i = \pi_k$ and $j = \pi_{k+1}$ for some $k \in [n-1]$. For example, the permutation $\pi = 561243$ has the following inversions (\textbf{descents} in bold): $(5,1), (5,2), (5,4), (5,3), \textbf{(6,1)}, (6,2), (6,4), (6,3), \textbf{(4,3)}$.  The \emph{permutation graph} of $\pi$ is the graph with vertex set $[n]$ and edge set the set of inversions of $\pi$. We denote this graph $G_{\pi}$. Figure~\ref{fig:perm_graph} shows the permutation graph of $\pi = 561243$. Note that the labels of the vertices are the row labels in the graphical representation of $\pi$.

\end{figure}

\begin{proposition}\label{pro:perm_graph_connected}
Let $\pi$ be a permutation. The permutation graph $G_{\pi}$ is connected if and only if the permutation $\pi$ is irreducible.
\end{proposition}

This is a classical result on permutation graphs, see e.g.~\cite[Lemma~3.2]{KR}. From now on, we assume that all permutations are irreducible unless explicitly stated otherwise. One permutation that will play an important role in our paper, particularly in Section~\ref{sec:upper-diag} and Theorem~\ref{thm:max_b(n,k)}, is the \emph{decreasing} permutation, defined by $\dec[n] := n(n-1)\cdots 1$ (for some $n \geq 1$). In $\dec[n]$ every pair is an inversion, so the corresponding graph is the complete graph $K_n$.




Let $\pi$ be an $n$-permutation, and $\tau$ a $k$-permutation for some $k \leq n$. We say that $\pi$ \emph{contains} the \emph{pattern} $\tau$ if there exist indices $i_1 < i_2 < \cdots < i_k$ such that $\pi_{i_1}, \pi_{i_2}, \cdots, \pi_{i_k}$ appear in the same relative order as $\tau$. In other words, if we delete all columns and rows other than $(i_1, \pi_{i_1}), \cdots (i_k, \pi_{i_k})$ from the graphical representation of $\pi$, we get the graphical representation of $\tau$. In this case, we call $\pi_{i_1}, \cdots, \pi_{i_k}$ an \emph{occurrence} of the pattern $\tau$. If $\pi$ does not contain the pattern $\tau$, we say that $\pi$ \emph{avoids} $\tau$. For example, the permutation $\pi = 561243$ contains two occurrences of the pattern $321$, given by the bolded letters: $\textbf{5}612\textbf{43}$, $5\textbf{6}12\textbf{43}$. However, it avoids the pattern $4321$ since there is no sequence of $4$ letters in decreasing order.

The study of permutation patterns has been of wide interest in permutation research in recent decades, with much focus on the enumeration of permutations avoiding certain given patterns. For example, it is still an open problem to establish the growth rate of the set of $n$-permutations avoiding the pattern $1324$ (see~\cite{BBPP} and \cite{MN} for recent results in that direction). For more information on permutation patterns, we refer the interested reader to Kitaev's book~\cite{Kit} or Chapters~4 and 5 in the most recent edition of B\'ona's book~\cite{Bona}.

Patterns of a permutation $\pi$ are linked to induced subgraphs of its permutation graph $G_{\pi}$ via the following observation. Let $\pi$ be an $n$-permutation, and $\tau$ a $k$-permutation, for some $k \leq n$. Suppose that $\pi_1, \cdots, \pi_k$ is an occurrence of the pattern $\tau$ in $\pi$. 
Then the induced subgraph $G\left[\{\pi_1, \cdots, \pi_k\} \right]$ is isomorphic to the permutation graph $G_{\tau}$. Conversely, if there exist vertices $\pi_1, \cdots, \pi_k$ such that $G \left[ \{ \pi_1, \cdots, \pi_k\} \right]$ is isomorphic to $G_{\tau}$, then $\pi_1, \cdots, \pi_k$ is an occurrence of the pattern $\tau$ in $\pi$. This yields the following.

\begin{proposition}\label{pro:perm_patterns_cycles}
Let $\pi$ be a permutation, and $G_{\pi}$ its corresponding permutation graph.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The graph $G_{\pi}$ induces a $3$-cycle if, and only if, the permutation $\pi$ contains the pattern $321$.
\item The graph $G_{\pi}$ induces a $4$-cycle if, and only if, the permutation $\pi$ contains the pattern $3412$.
\item The graph $G_{\pi}$ induces no cycle of length $5$ or more.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

Points~(1) and (2) follow from the above observation, combined with the fact that $3$- and $4$-cycles correspond uniquely to the permutations $321$ and $3412$ respectively. Point~(3) was shown in~\cite[Proposition~1.7]{BV}.

\subsection{Complete non-ambiguous trees and associated permutations}\label{subsec:cnats_prelims}

In this section we define (complete) non-ambiguous trees and introduce their associated permutations. Non-ambiguous trees were orignially introduced by Aval \textit{et al.}\ in~\cite{ABBS} as a special case of the tree-like tableaux from~\cite{ABN}. 

\begin{definition}\label{def:nat}
A \emph{non-ambiguous tree} (NAT) is a filling of an $m \times n $ rectangular grid, where each cell is either dotted or not, satisfying the following conditions.
\begin{enumerate}
\item\label{cond:cnat_def_nonempty} Every row and every column contains at least one dotted cell.
\item\label{cond:cnat_def_uniqueparent} Aside from the top-left cell, every dotted cell has either a dotted cell above it in the same column, or a dotted cell to its left in the same row, but not both.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

Note that the two conditions imply that the top-left cell must always be dotted. The use of the word \emph{tree} to describe these objects comes from the following observation. Given a NAT $T$, we connect every dot $d$ not in the top-left cell to its \emph{parent} dot $p(d)$, which is the dot immediately above it in its column or to its left in its row (by Condition~\eqref{cond:cnat_def_uniqueparent} of the above definition, exactly one of these must exist). This yields a binary tree, rooted at the top-left dot (see Figure~\ref{fig:nat_cnat}).

Following tree terminology, for a NAT $T$, we call the dot lying in the top left cell the \emph{root dot}, or simply the \emph{root}, of $T$. Similarly, a \emph{leaf dot} is a dot with no dots below it in the same column or to its right in the same row. An \emph{internal dot} is a dot which is not a leaf dot (this includes the root, unless the NAT is a single dotted cell). Given a NAT, it will be convenient to label the columns $1, 2, \cdots n$ from left to right, and the rows $1, 2, \cdots, m$ from top to bottom.

A NAT is said to be \emph{complete} if the underlying tree is complete, i.e.\ every internal dot has exactly two children. More formally, a complete non-ambiguous tree (CNAT) is a NAT in which every dot either has both a dot below it in the same column and a dot to its right in the same row, or neither of these. The \emph{size} of a CNAT is its number of leaf dots, or equivalently one more than its number of internal dots.

\caption{Two examples of NATs. Leaf dots are represented in blue, and internal dots in black. The NAT on the left is complete, while the one on the right is not (the red dot has only one child).\label{fig:nat_cnat}}
\end{figure}

It is straightforward to check that in a CNAT, every row and every column must have exactly one leaf dot (see e.g.~\cite[Section~4.3]{DSSS2} or \cite[Section~2.1]{CO}). The leaf dot in a column, resp.\ row, is simply its bottom-most, resp.\ right-most, dot. As such, the set of leaf dots of a CNAT $T$ of size $n$ forms the graphical representation of an $n$-permutation $\pi$, which must be irreducible (see e.g.~\cite[Theorem~3.3]{CO}). We say that $\pi$ is the permutation \emph{associated} with the CNAT $T$. For example, the CNAT on the left of Figure~\ref{fig:nat_cnat} has associated permutation $\pi = 45312$.  For a permutation $\pi$, we define the set $\CNAT[\pi]$ to be the set of CNATs whose associated permutation is $\pi$, and $\cnat[\pi] := \vert \CNAT[\pi] \vert$ to be the number of such permutations.

\subsection{The Abelian sandpile model}\label{subsec:asm_prelims}

In this section we give a brief introduction to the Abelian sandpile model (ASM). We define the notion of recurrent configurations, and recall Dhar's burning algorithm for checking if a given configuration is recurrent or not.

A \emph{sandpile graph} is a pair $(G,s)$ where $G$ is a graph, and $s \in V(G)$ a distinguished vertex of $G$. We will call $s$ the \emph{sink} of the sandpile graph $(G,s)$.
For a sandpile graph $(G,s)$, we denote $\V(G) := V(G) \setminus \{s\}$ the set of non-sink vertices. 
A \emph{configuration} on $(G,s)$ is a vector $c = (c_v)_{v \in \V(G)} \in \Zp^{\vert \V(G) \vert}$ which assigns a non-negative integer to each non-sink vertex. We think of $c_v$ as the number of ``grains of sand'' at vertex $v$. 
We denote $\Config{s}{G}$ the set of configurations on $(G,s)$. 
For $v \in V(G)$, let $\alpha^v \in \Config{s}{G}$ be the configuration $c$ with $c_v = 1$ and $c_w = 0$ for $w \neq v$. By convention, $\alpha^s$ is the all-0 configuration.

A vertex $v \in \V(G)$ is said to be \emph{stable} in a configuration $c$ if $c_v < \dgr[v]$. Otherwise it is \emph{unstable}. A configuration is stable if all its vertices are stable, and we denote $\Stable{s}{G}$ the set of all stable configurations on $(G,s)$. 
Unstable vertices topple as follows. 
We define the \emph{toppling operator} $\Top_v$ corresponding to the toppling of an unstable vertex $v \in \V(G)$ in a configuration $c \in \Config{s}{G}$ by:
\beq\label{eq:toppling}
\Top_v(c) := c - \dgr[v] \alpha^v + \sum_{w \sim v} \alpha^w,
\eeq
where the sum is over all neighbours $w$ of $v$ in $G$, and the addition operator on configurations denotes pointwise addition at each vertex. In words, the toppling of a vertex $v$ sends one grain of sand from $v$ to each neighbour $w$ of $v$ in $G$.

Performing this toppling may cause other vertices to become unstable, and we topple these also. 
One can show (see e.g.~\cite[Section~5.2]{Dhar}) that starting from some unstable configuration $c$ and toppling successively unstable vertices, we eventually reach a stable configuration $c'$ (think of the sink as absorbing grains). 
In addition, the configuration $c'$ reached does not depend on the sequence in which vertices are toppled. 
We call this $c'$ the \emph{stabilisation} of $c$ and denote it $\Stab(c)$.

We now define a Markov chain on the set $\Stable{s}{G}$ of stable configurations.
Fix a probability distribution $\mu=(\mu_v)_{v \in \V(G)}$ on $\V(G)$ such that $\mu_v>0$ for all $v \in \V(G)$.
At each step of the Markov chain we add a grain at the vertex $v$ with probability $\mu_v$ and stabilise the resulting configuration.

The \emph{recurrent} configurations are those appear infinitely often in the long-time running of this Markov chain. We let $\Rec{s}{G}$ be the set of recurrent configurations for the ASM on the graph $(G,s)$. The study of the recurrent configurations has been of central importance in ASM research (see e.g.~\cite{SelWheel} and references therein). Here we recall a classical result known as the \emph{burning algorithm} due to Dhar~\cite[Section~6.1]{Dhar}, which provides a simple algorithmic process to check if a given configuration is recurrent or not.

\begin{theorem}[Dhar's burning criterion]
Let $(G,s)$ be a sandpile graph, and $c \in \Stable{s}{G}$ a stable configuration. Then $c$ is recurrent if, and only if, 
$$\Stab\left(c + \sum\limits_{v \sim s} \alpha^v \right) = c,$$
where the sum is over all neighbours $v$ of the sink $s$ in $G$. Moreover, if $c$ is recurrent, then in this stabilisation each non-sink vertex of $\V(G)$ topples exactly once.
\end{theorem}

In words, a configuration $c$ is recurrent if, and only if, the following assertion holds. Starting from the configuration $c$, add a grain to each vertex $v$ adjacent to the sink $s$ (one can think of this as ``toppling the sink''). Then stabilising the resulting configuration yields the original configuration $c$.

\subsection{Minimal recurrent configurations}\label{subsec:minrec_prelims}

There is a natural partial order on the set $\Rec{s}{G}$ of recurrent configurations for the ASM on $(G,s)$. For two configurations $c, c' \in \Rec{s}{G}$, we define $c \preceq c'$ if, and only if, $c_v \leq c'_v$ for all $v \in \V(G)$. A \emph{minimal recurrent configuration} is a recurrent configuration which is minimal for this partial order. In words, a minimal recurrent configuration is a recurrent configuration where the removal of one grain of sand from any vertex would cause the configuration to no longer be recurrent. We let $\MinRec{s}{G}$ denote the set of minimal recurrent configurations for the ASM on $(G,s)$.

Minimal recurrent configurations can also be characterised in terms of their total number of grains. For a recurrent configuration $c \in \Rec{s}{G}$, we define the \emph{level} of $c$ by
\beq\label{eq:def_level}
\level{s}{c} := \sum\limits_{v \in \V(G)} c_v + \dgr[s] - \vert E(G) \vert.
\eeq
It is well-known (see e.g.~\cite[Theorem~3.5]{Mer}) that $\level{s}{c} \geq 0$ for any recurrent configuration $c$. Moreover, we have the following (see~\cite[Proposition~2.11]{Sel} for a proof, although this fact seems to be implicit in various sandpile-related works).

\begin{proposition}\label{pro:minrec_level}
Let $c \in \Rec{s}{G}$. Then $c$ is minimal recurrent if, and only if, $\level{s}{c} = 0$.
\end{proposition}

Another important fact about minimal recurrent configurations is that their number does not depend on the choice of sink vertex. Indeed, it was shown in~\cite{Mer} that the \emph{level polynomial} of a graph, given by
\beq\label{eq:def_level_poly}
\Level[s,G](x) := \sum\limits_{c \in \Rec{s}{G}} x^{\level{s}{c}},
\eeq
is given by a specification of the Tutte polynomial, and therefore does not depend on the choice of sink $s$. In particular, this holds for the evaluation $\Level[s,G](0)$ which is equal to the number of minimal recurrent configurations on $(G,s)$ by Proposition~\ref{pro:minrec_level}. We therefore simply let $\minrec[G] := \left\vert \MinRec{s}{G} \right\vert$ denote the number of minimal recurrent configurations for the ASM on $G$, and this does not depend on the choice of sink $s$. This will be useful at various points in this paper, since it allows us to choose the sink according to what is most appropriate in any situation. 

The following bijective characterisation of minimal recurrent configurations was shown in~\cite[Corollary~3]{Sch}.

\begin{proposition}\label{pro:minrec_acor}
Let $G$ be a graph, and $s \in V(G)$ a vertex of $G$. Then the map $\OO \mapsto (\In[v])_{v \in \V(G)}$ is a bijection from the set $\AO{s}{G}$ of $s$-rooted acyclic orientations of the graph $G$ to the set $ \MinRec{s}{G} $ of minimal recurrent configurations on the sandpile graph $(G,s)$.
\end{proposition}

We end this section with some useful structural results. The first shows that ``pruning'' a graph of its tree branches does not affect its number of minimal recurrent configurations. Given a graph $G$, we define the \emph{pruned graph} $\Prune[G]$ through the following algorithmic procedure.
\begin{enumerate}
\item\label{prune:init} Initialise $H = G$.
\item\label{prune:remove} If $H$ contains no vertex of degree $1$, move to Step~3. Otherwise, choose a vertex $v$ with degree $1$, set $H = H \setminus \{v\}$, and repeat Step~2.
\item\label{prune:output} Output $H := \Prune[G]$.
\end{enumerate}
Another way of viewing the pruning operation is that it removes ``tree branches'' that were attached at some vertices in the graph $G$. An example is shown on Figure~\ref{fig:pruning} below. Note that the output $\Prune[G]$ only depends on the choice of vertex $v$ in Step~\eqref{prune:remove} if at some stage of the process we reach a graph $H$ which is reduced to a single edge, which occurs in fact exactly when the original graph $G$ is a tree. In that case, removing either of the two vertices will yield a graph consisting of a single vertex, and we simply set $\Prune[G]$ to be any arbitrary vertex of the original graph.

\end{figure}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:tree_pruning_minrec}
For any graph $G$, we have $\minrec[G] = \minrec[\Prune[G]]$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By induction, it suffices to show that if a vertex $v \in G$ has degree $1$, then $\minrec[G \setminus \{v\}] = \minrec[G]$. Let $\OO$ be a $v$-rooted acyclic orientation of $G$. Let $v'$ be the sole neighbour of $v$ in $G$, and define $\OO'$ be the orientation of $G' := G \setminus \{v\}$ obtained by deleting the edge $v \olefta v'$ from $\OO$. By construction, $\OO'$ is acyclic, so must have at least one target. But the only possible target is $v'$, since $v$ is the only target of $\OO$. 
Therefore $\OO'$ is a $v'$-rooted acyclic orientation of $G'$, and the map $\OO \mapsto \OO'$ is clearly a bijection from $\AO{v}{G}$ to $\AO{v'}{G'}$. The result then follows from Proposition~\ref{pro:minrec_acor}.
\end{proof}

Our next lemma concerns graphs whose pruned graph is a cycle. For $k \geq 3$, we say that a graph $G$ is a \emph{decorated $k$-cycle} if its pruned graph $\Prune[G]$ is the $k$-cycle $C_k$. Equivalently, $G$ contains a $k$-cycle, and deleting any edge in that $k$-cycle makes $G$ a tree.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:minrec_dec_cycle}
If $G$ is a decorated $k$-cycle for some $k \geq 3$, then we have $\minrec[G] = k-1$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
If $G$ is a decorated $k$-cycle, then $\Prune[G]$ is the $k$-cycle $C_k$ by definition. Lemma~\ref{lem:tree_pruning_minrec} then yields that $\minrec[G] = \minrec[C_k]$. The fact that $\minrec[C_k] = k-1$ is well known, see e.g.~\cite{Red}. Indeed, in this case the minimal recurrent configurations are given by removing one grain from the all-1 configuration $(1,\cdots,1)$ at any non-sink vertex (there are $(k-1)$ such vertices).
\end{proof}

Our next two lemmas show that when we ``grow'' a graph $G$ (in a certain sense) we increase its number of minimal recurrent configurations.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:add_edge_minrec}
Let $G$ be a graph, with a pair of vertices $v,w$ such that $(v,w)$ is \emph{not} an edge of $G$. Let $G' := G \cup \{(v,w)\}$ be the graph $G$ to which we add the edge $(v,w)$. Then $\minrec[G] < \minrec[G']$.
\end{lemma}

If $G'$ is obtained from $G$ as above, we say that $G'$ is an \emph{edge addition} of $G$.

\begin{proof}
Let $G$, $(v,w)$, and $G'$ be as in the statement of the lemma. Define $N_G(w)$ to be the set of neighbours of $w$ in $G$ (also the set of neighbours of $w$ in $G'$ other than $v$). For any $\OO \in \AO{v}{G}$, we can construct $\OO' \in \AO{v}{G'}$ be setting $v \oolefta w$ and leaving directions of other edges unchanged from $\OO$. Clearly the map $\OO \mapsto \OO'$ is injective. Moreover, for any $\OO$, since $w$ is not a target of $\OO$, there must be $w' \in N_G(w)$ such that $w \orighta w'$, i.e. $w \oorighta w'$. It therefore suffices to show that we can construct $\OO' \in \AO{v}{G'}$ such that for all $w' \in N_G(w)$, we have $w \oolefta w'$.

For this, consider the graph $H := G' \setminus \{v\}$ to be the graph $G$ with $v$ removed. The graph $H$ has $k$ connected components $H_1,\cdots, H_k$ for some $k \geq 1$. By construction each of these connected components must have at least one vertex adjacent to $v$ in $G'$. Assume without loss of generality that $w \in V(H_1)$. Note that this implies that all neighbours $w' \in N_G(w)$ of $w$ in $G$ are also in the connected component $H_1$. Define $w_1 := w$, and for each $j \in \{2, \cdots, k\}$ choose some vertex $w_j \in V(H_j)$ which is adjacent to $v$ in $G$. Now for $j \in \{1,\cdots,k\}$, let $\OO^{(j)}$ be a $w_j$-rooted acyclic orientation of $H_j$. In particular, we have $w \xleftarrow{\OO^{(1)}} w'$ for all $w' \in N_G(w)$. Finally, define an orientation $\OO'$ of $G'$ by leaving the directions of any edge $(u,u')$ in $\OO^{(j)}$ (for all $j$) unchanged, and setting $v \oolefta v'$ for all neighbours $v'$ of $v$ in $G'$. By construction, $\OO'$ is a $v$-rooted acyclic orientation of $G'$, with $w \oolefta w'$ for all $w' \in N_G(w)$, as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:dupl_edge_minrec}
Let $G$ be a graph, and $e = (v,w)$ an edge of $G$. Let $G'$ be the graph $G$ where we have replaced $e$ with two edges $(v,u)$ and $(u,w)$ for a new vertex $u \notin G$. Then $\minrec[G] \leq \minrec[G']$.
\end{lemma}

If $G'$ is obtained from $G$ as above, we say that $G'$ is an \emph{edge duplication} of $G$. Note that in this case the inequality is not always strict. For example, duplicating an edge that belongs to a ``tree branch'' (i.e.\ a branch that would be removed in the pruning of $G$, such as the blue edges on the left of Figure~\ref{fig:pruning}) does not change the number of minimal recurrent configurations.

\begin{proof}
Let $G$ and $G'$ be as in the statement of the lemma. Fix some vertex $s$ in $G$. For any $s$-rooted acyclic orientation $\OO$ of $G$, we define an $s$-rooted acyclic orientation $\OO'$ of $G'$ by replacing $v \orighta w$, resp.\ $v \olefta w$, with $v \oorighta u$ and $u \oorighta w$, resp.\ $v \oolefta u$ and $u \oolefta w$. Then $\OO \mapsto \OO'$ is clearly an injection $\AO{s}{G} \rightarrow \AO{s}{G'}$, and by Proposition~\ref{pro:minrec_acor}, the lemma follows.
\end{proof}

Our final structural result is more-or-less part of the ASM ``folklore'', but we have been unable to find it stated as such anywhere in the sandpile literature. For completeness, we therefore state and prove it here.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:minrec_tree}
Let $G$ be a graph. Then we have $\minrec[G] = 1$ if, and only if, $G$ is a tree.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
If $G$ is a tree, and $s$ a vertex of $G$, then we can reduce $G$ to the graph $H$ consisting of a single edge $(s,t)$ in the pruning process. It is straightforward to see that $\Stable{s}{H} = \Rec{s}{H} = \MinRec{s}{H} = \{ (0_t) \}$ (the configuration consisting of no grains at the non-sink vertex $t$) in this case. Conversely, if $G$ contains a cycle of length $k \geq 3$, we can construct $G$ from the $3$-cycle through a succession of edge additions and duplications. From Lemmas~\ref{lem:add_edge_minrec} and \ref{lem:dupl_edge_minrec}, we get that $\minrec[G] \geq \minrec[C_3] = 3-1 = 2$ (applying Lemma~\ref{lem:minrec_dec_cycle}), as desired.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Connecting the ASM to CNATs}\label{subsec:cnats_asm_prelims}

We are now ready to state the connection between CNATs and the ASM. This will allow us to prove a number of conjectures from~\cite{CO} in Section~\ref{sec:cnat_count}.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:cnat_minrec}
Let $\pi \in S_n$ be an $n$-permutation for some $n \geq 1$, $G_{\pi}$ the corresponding permutation graph, and $s \in [n]$ a fixed sink vertex of $G_{\pi}$. Then the following three sets are equinumerous.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The set $\CNAT[\pi]$ of CNATs whose associated permutation is $\pi$.
\item The set $\MinRec{s}{G_{\pi}}$ of minimal recurrent configurations for the ASM on $(G_{\pi},s)$.
\item The set $\AO{s}{G_{\pi}}$ of $s$-rooted acyclic orientations of $G_{\pi}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The bijection between $\MinRec{s}{G_{\pi}}$ and $\AO{s}{G_{\pi}}$ is given in Proposition~\ref{pro:minrec_acor}, and holds for general graphs $(G,s)$, not just permutation graphs. That $\CNAT[\pi]$ and $\MinRec{s}{G_{\pi}}$ are equinumerous is stated in~\cite[Proposition~31, Corollary~33]{DSSS2}. Note that it remains an open problem to find a direct bijective proof of this fact.
\end{proof}

We end the preliminary section by stating another structural lemma, linking the number of CNATs of a permutation $\pi$ to the number of CNATs of any pattern occurring in $\pi$.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:cnat_pattern}
Suppose that $\pi, \tau$ are permutations such that $\pi$ contains the pattern $\tau$. Then we have $\cnat[\tau] \leq \cnat[\pi]$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Since $\pi$ contains the pattern $\tau$, the permutation graph $G_{\pi}$ contains an induced subgraph graph $H$ which is isomorphic to $G_{\tau}$ by the remarks at the end of Section~\ref{subsec:perms_prelims}. Note that we have $\minrec[G_{\tau}] = \minrec[H]$ in this case. The graph $G_{\pi}$ can then be constructed as follows. Fix some spanning tree $G'$ of $G_{\pi}$. Let $G^0$ be the graph with vertex set $[n] = V\left(G_{\pi}\right)$ and edge set $E\left( G^0 \right) := E(G') \cup E(H)$. By construction, since $G'$ is a tree, we have $\Prune[G^0] = \Prune[H]$, so that $\minrec[G^0] = \minrec[H]$ by Lemma~\ref{lem:tree_pruning_minrec}. Moreover, we have $E\left( G^0 \right) \subseteq E\left(G_{\pi}\right)$, so that the graph $G_{\pi}$ can be obtained from $G^0$ through a (possibly empty) sequence of edge additions. Applying Lemma~\ref{lem:add_edge_minrec} then yields that $\minrec[G^0] \leq \minrec[G_{\pi}]$. Combined with the above, we get $\minrec[G_{\tau}] = \minrec[H] \leq \minrec[G_{\pi}]$, and the result follows from Theorem~\ref{thm:cnat_minrec}.
\end{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% SECTION 3 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Upper-diagonal CNATs and permutations}\label{sec:upper-diag}

In~\cite{CO}, the authors showed that for the decreasing permutation $\dec[n] = n(n-1)\cdots 1$, we have $\cnat[{\dec[n]}] = (n-1)!$. This is implicit through the results of Section~\ref{sec:prelim}. Indeed, in this case the graph $G_{\pi}$ is the complete graph $K_n$, and it is known that minimal recurrent configurations for the complete graph $K_n$ are exactly permutations of $\{0, \cdots, n-2\}$ (see e.g.~\cite{Sel} or \cite{CoriRos}).

The proof of this result in~\cite{CO} is via so-called tiered trees, with the authors exhibiting a bijection between upper-diagonal fully tiered trees on $n$ vertices and permutations of $[n-1]$. In this section, we give a new proof of this result by exhibiting a direct bijection between the set $\CNAT[{\dec[n]}]$ and the set of permutations of $[n-1]$. Our bijection also maps certain statistics of CNATs to statistics on the corresponding permutation. Following notation from~\cite{CO}, we call a CNAT \emph{upper-diagonal} if its associated permutation is a decreasing permutation.

\begin{definition}\label{def:labelled_cnat}
A \emph{labelled CNAT} is a pair 
$\T = (T, \lambda)$
 where $T$ is an upper-diagonal CNAT of size $(n+1)$ for some $n \geq 0$ and $\lambda = \{ \lambda_1, \lambda_2, \cdots, \lambda_n \} \subset \N^n$ is a set of $n$ distinct natural numbers. We call $\lambda$ the \emph{labels} of $\T$, and say that $\T$ is a $\lambda$-labelled CNAT.
\end{definition}

In the above, we think of $\lambda$ as labelling the columns of the CNAT $T$ other than the right-most column, as in Figures~\ref{fig:top_decomp_cnat} and \ref{fig:top_del_cnat} below (the labels are written on top of the columns). With a slight abuse of notation, we assume that $\lambda_1 < \lambda_2 < \cdots < \lambda_n$, and use $\lambda$ to denote both the set of labels and the ordered tuple $(\lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_n)$. Note that the number of labels is one less than the size of the underlying CNAT.

Now suppose that $\T = (T, \lambda)$ is a $\lambda$-labelled CNAT, such that the underlying CNAT $T$ has at least two internal dots in the top row. Let $\lambda_r$ be the label of the right-most of these, i.e.\ the right-most internal dot in the top row of $T$ is in the $r$-th column. The \emph{top-row decomposition} of $\T$ is the pair $\left( \T^{\ell}, \T^r \right)$ defined as follows:
 \begin{itemize}
 \item $\T^r := (T^r, \lambda^r)$, where $T^r$ is the sub-tree of $T$ whose root is the dot in cell $(r,1)$ (the right-most internal dot in the top row of $T$). In other words, $T^r$ is obtained from $T$ by keeping exactly the rows and columns containing dots whose path to the root in $T$ goes through the dot in cell $(1,r)$. Then $\lambda^r$ is the set of labels whose columns have at least one dot in $T^r$.
 \item $T^{\ell} := (T^{\ell}, \lambda^{\ell})$, where $T^{\ell}$ is obtained from $T$ by replacing the internal dot in cell $(1,r)$ by a leaf dot and moving it to the right-most column, and $\lambda^{\ell}$ is again the set of labels whose columns have at least one dot in $T^{\ell}$ (excluding the new leaf dot).
 \end{itemize}
We will sometimes refer to $\T^r$, resp.\ $\T^{\ell}$, as the right, resp.\ left, subtree of $\T$. The top-row decomposition of a labelled CNAT is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:top_decomp_cnat}.

We write $\T = \T^{\ell} \oplus \T^r$ for the top-row decomposition of a labelled CNAT $\T$. Note that this partitions the label set $\lambda$ into two (disjoint) subsets $\lambda^{\ell}$ and $\lambda^r$. Moreover, the operation is invertible in the following sense. Given two labelled CNATs $\T^{\ell} = (T^{\ell}, \lambda^{\ell})$ and $\T^r = (T^r, \lambda^r)$ with disjoint label sets such that the minimum label $\lambda^r_1$ of $\T^r$ is strictly greater than the labels of all (internal) top row dots in $\T^{\ell}$, then there exists a unique labelled CNAT $\T$ such that $\T = \T^{\ell} \oplus \T^r$. Here $\T$ is obtained by ``gluing'' the tree $T^r$ onto the right-most leaf of $T^{\ell}$ (in the top row), and shifting the columns of the glued subtree in such a way that the labelling of the tree obtained remains in increasing order.

\caption{Illustrating the top-row decomposition of a labelled CNAT.\label{fig:top_decomp_cnat}}
\end{figure}

Now suppose that we have a labelled CNAT $\T = (T, \lambda)$ such that the only internal dot in the top row of $T$ is the root of the tree. Such a tree must necessarily have a dot in the second row of the first column, which we call $\rho'$. We define the \emph{top-row deletion} of $\T$ as the labelled tree $\T' := (T', \lambda')$ where $T'$ is the CNAT $T$ with top row deleted (i.e.\ the subtree rooted at $\rho'$), and $\lambda' := \lambda \setminus \{\lambda_1\}$ is the set of labels $\lambda$ with its minimum element removed. This operation is shown on Figure~\ref{fig:top_del_cnat}, with the labelled CNAT on the left, and its top-row deleted labelled CNAT on the right.

This operation is not completely invertible, since we lose the information of the minimum label of $\T$. However, this is the only information that is lost. That is, given a labelled CNAT $\T' = (T', \lambda')$, and a label $k < \min \lambda'$, there exists a unique labelled CNAT $\T = (T, \lambda:=\lambda' \cup \{k\})$ whose top-row deletion is $\T'$.

\caption{Illustrating the top-row deletion of a labelled CNAT.\label{fig:top_del_cnat}}
\end{figure}

We are now equipped to define the desired bijection from upper-diagonal CNATs to permutations. In fact, given any label set $\lambda$, we define a bijection from $\lambda$-labelled CNATs to permutations of $\lambda$. Since upper-diagonal CNATs of size $n$ can be viewed as $[n-1]$-labelled CNATs, this gives the desired bijection.

Fix a label set $\lambda = (\lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_n)$, and a $\lambda$-labelled CNAT $\T = (T, \lambda)$. We define a permutation $\Psi(\T)$ of the label set $\lambda$ recursively as follows.
\begin{itemize}
\item If $T$ is the CNAT reduced a a single root dot, i.e.\ is the CNAT of size $1$ (in which case $\lambda = \emptyset$), we define $\Psi(\T)$ to be the empty word (base case).
\item If the only internal dot in the top row of $T$ is the root, we define recursively $\Psi(\T) := \lambda_1 \concat \Psi(\T')$ where $\T'$ is the top-row deletion of $\T$ (here the $\cdot$ operation denotes concatenation).
\item Otherwise, if there is more than one internal dot in the top row of $T$, we define recursively $\Psi(\T) := \Psi \left( \T^r \right) \concat \Psi \left( \T^{\ell} \right)$, where $\T = \T^{\ell} \oplus \T^r$ is the top-row decomposition of $\T$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{example}\label{ex:bij_cnat_perm}
Consider the labelled CNAT $\T$ in the left of Figure~\ref{fig:top_decomp_cnat}. We construct the associated permutation $\Psi(T)$ of the label set $\lambda = (2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 13, 14, 16)$. The first step is the top-row decomposition of $\T$ as in the figure. We therefore have $\Psi(\T) = \Psi \left( \T^r \right) \concat \Psi \left( \T^{\ell} \right)$, where $\T^r$ is the CNAT with label set $(9, 10, 14)$ and $\T^{\ell}$ the CNAT with label set $(2, 4, 5, 7, 13, 16)$ in the right-hand side of the equality in Figure~\ref{fig:top_decomp_cnat}. Here $\T^r$ has a unique dot in the top row, so $\Psi\left( \T^r \right) = 9 \concat \Psi \big( \left( \T^r \right)' \big)$, where $\left( \T^r \right)'$ is the top-row deletion of $\T^r$. This is the CNAT with $2$ internal dots in the top row and label set $(10, 14)$. Applying top-row decomposition followed by top-row deletion and the base case to the two subtrees gives $\Psi \big( \left( \T^r \right)' \big) = 14 \concat1 0$, so that $\Psi \left( \T^r \right) = 9 \concat 14 \concat 10$.

We then compute $\Psi \left( \T^{\ell} \right)$. Again, we start by applying top-row decomposition. The right sub-tree $\left( \T^{\ell} \right)^{r}$ in this decomposition has all its internal dots in the left-most row. One can easily check through successive applications of top-row deletion that such a labelled CNAT maps to the increasing permutation of its label set, so that $\Psi \left( \left( \T^{\ell} \right)^{r} \right) = 5 \concat 7 \concat 13 $. Finally, applying top-row deletion followed by top-row decomposition on the left sub-tree $\left( \T^{\ell} \right)^{\ell}$ gives $\Psi \left( \left( \T^{\ell} \right)^{\ell} \right) = 2 \concat 16 \concat 4$. Bringing it all together, we get $\Psi \left( \T \right) = 9 \concat 14 \concat 10 \concat 5 \concat 7 \concat 13 \concat 2 \concat 16 \concat 4$. 
\end{example}

Note that in Example~\ref{ex:bij_cnat_perm} above, the left-to-right minima of the permutation $\pi := \Psi(\T)$ are exactly the labels of the top-row dots of $\T$. Moreover, $\pi$ has $4 = 5-1$ descents, and there are $5$ empty rows in the underlying CNAT $T$ (the rows whose leaves are in columns labelled $2$, $4$, $5$, $9$, and $10$). It turns out that both of these observations are true in general, which is the main result of this section.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:bij_cnat_perm}
For any label set $\lambda$, the map $\Psi : \T \mapsto \Psi(T)$ is a bijection from the set of $\lambda$-labelled CNATs to the set of permutations of $\lambda$. Moreover, this bijection maps column labels of internal top row dots in $\T$ to left-to-right minima in the permutation $\Psi(\T)$. Finally, the number of empty rows in the underlying CNAT $T$ is equal to one plus the number of descents of $\Psi(\T)$.
\end{theorem}

In particular, if the label set is $\lambda = [n-1]$ for some $n \geq 1$, this gives us a bijection from upper-diagonal CNATs of size $n$ and $(n-1)$-permutations, providing a direct proof of Theorem~4.12 in~\cite{CO}, as announced.

\begin{proof}
Since top-row decomposition partitions the label set $\lambda$ into two (smaller) label sets, and top-row deletion removes the minimum label $\lambda_1$, we have that $\Psi(\T)$ is a permutation of $\lambda$ by a straightforward induction on the size of $\lambda$ using the recursive definition. 

Let us now show that if there is a dot in the column labelled $\lambda_i$ of $\T$, then $\lambda_i$ is a left-to-right minimum of the permutation $\Psi(\T)$. Again, we proceed by induction on $n$, the size of the label set $\lambda$. For $n=0$ the result is trivial. Now fix some $n > 0$, and suppose we have shown this for all label sets $\lambda'$ of size at most $n-1$. Fix a label set $\lambda = (\lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_n)$ of size $n$, and a $\lambda$-labelled CNAT $\T$.

Firstly, consider the case where $\T$ has a unique internal dot in the top row, which is necessarily the root, in column labelled $\lambda_1 = \min \lambda$. By construction $\lambda_1$ is the first element in the permutation $\Psi(\T)$, and is therefore its unique left-to-right minimum, as desired.

It thus remains to consider the case where $\T$ has at least two internal dots in the top row. In this case write the top-row decomposition $\T = \T^{\ell} \oplus \T^r$ of $\T$.  By construction the labels of top-row internal dots of $\T$ are exactly those of top-row dots of $\T^{\ell}$, plus the label $\lambda^r_1$ of the right-most dot in that row (the root of $T^r$). By the induction hypothesis, $\Psi(\T^{\ell})$ is a permutation of $\lambda^{\ell}$ whose left-to-right minima are the column lables of the top-row dots of $\T^{\ell}$. In particular, this implies that the first letter in $\Psi(\T^{\ell})$ is strictly less than $\lambda^r_1$. Moreover, by the above argument $\Psi(\T^r)$ is a permutation of $\lambda^r$ starting with $\lambda^r_1$ (the minimal element of $\lambda^r$). This implies that the left-to-right minima in the permutation $\Psi(\T) = \Psi(\T^r) \concat \Psi(\T^{\ell})$ are exactly $\lambda^r_1$ and the left-to-right minima of $\Psi(\T^{\ell})$, and the result follows by applying the induction hypothesis to $\Psi(\T^{\ell})$.

To show that $\Psi$ is a bijection, we construct its inverse recursively, and show it maps left-to-right minima to top-row internal dots in the labelled CNAT. Let $\pi = \pi_1\cdots \pi_n$ be a permutation of a label set $\lambda = (\lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_n)$. We define a $\lambda$-labelled CNAT $\T := \Phi(\pi)$ as follows.
\begin{itemize}[topsep=2pt]
\item If $\lambda = \emptyset$ ($\pi$ is the empty word in this case), we set $T$ to be the CNAT consisting of a unique root dot, and $\T = (T, \emptyset)$ to be the labelled CNAT (base case).
\item If $\pi_1 = \lambda_1$ (the first element of $\pi$ is the minimum label in $\lambda$), then we first calculate recursively $\T' = \Phi(\pi' := \pi_2\cdots n)$, and then let $\T$ be the unique $\lambda$-labelled CNAT whose top-row deletion is $\T'$ (see preceding remarks). By construction the CNAT has a unique dot in the top-row, which is in column labelled $\lambda_1$, which gives the desired result.
\item Otherwise, define $k = \min \{i \geq 2; \pi_i < \pi_1 \}$, and decompose $\pi = (\pi_1 \cdots \pi_{k-1})(\pi_k \cdots \pi_n) := \pi^r \pi^{\ell}$. In other words, the first element of $\pi^{\ell}$ is the second left-to-right minimum in $\pi$. Then calculate $\T^{\ell} = \Phi(\pi^{\ell})$ and $\T^r = \Phi(\pi^r)$ recursively. By construction, the permutation $\pi^r$ begins with its minimum label, so the top-row of $\T^r$ is empty except for the leaf and root dot from the above case. Moreover, the minimum label of $\T^r$ is $\pi_1$, which by definition is greater than all left-to-right minima in $\pi^{\ell}$. By the induction hypothesis, this means exactly that the minimum label of $\T^r$ is greater than the labels of all the top-row internal dots in $\T^{\ell}$. Preceding remarks then say that there is a unique labelled CNAT $\T$ such that $\T = \T^{\ell} \oplus \T^r$, and we set $\Phi(\pi) = \T$. By construction, the column labels of the top-row dots of $\T$ are those of $\T^{\ell}$ plus that of the root of $\T^r$, which by the induction hypothesis are exactly the left-to-right minima of $\pi$, as desired.
\end{itemize}
That $\Psi$ and $\Phi$ are inverse of each other is straightforward from the construction, which proves the first part of the theorem.

It remains to show that the number of empty rows in $\T$ is one plus the number of descents of $\Psi(\T)$. Again, we proceed by induction. For a labelled CNAT $\T$, resp.\ a permutation $\pi$, let $\ER[\T]$, resp.\ $\des[\pi]$, be its number of empty rows, resp.\ descents. Again, we proceed by induction on the size $n$ of the label set $\lambda$. The base case $n=0$ is trivial. For $n \geq 1$, suppose we have shown that $\ER[\T'] = 1 + \des[\Psi(\T')]$ for all $\lambda'$ of size at most $n-1$ and $\lambda'$-labelled CNATs $\T'$.

Fix some label set $\lambda = (\lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_n)$ and $\lambda$-labelled CNAT $\T$. 
\begin{itemize}[topsep=2pt]
  \item If $\T$ has a unique internal dot in its top-row, let $\T'$ be the top-row deletion of $\T$. Then $\ER[\T] = \ER[\T'] = 1 + \des[\Psi(\T')]$ by induction. But by construction $\Psi(\T) = \lambda_1 \concat \Psi(\T')$ with $\lambda_1 = \min \lambda$, which immediately implies $\des[\Psi(\T)] = \des[\Psi(\T')]$, and the desired result follows.
  \item Otherwise, write $\T = \T^{\ell} \oplus \T^r$ for the top-row decomposition of $\T$. By construction we have $\Psi(\T) = \Psi(\T^r) \concat \Psi(\T^{\ell})$. Moreover, we know from the previous part of the proof that the first element of $\Psi(\T^r)$, which is also its smallest element, is strictly greater than all the left-to-right minima of $\Psi(\T^{\ell})$, and thus in particular than its first element. This implies that there is a descent between the last element of $\Psi(\T^r)$ and the first element of $\Psi(\T^{\ell})$, so that $\des[\Psi(\T)] = \des[\Psi(\T^r)] + 1 + \des[\Psi(\T^{\ell}]$. Applying the induction hypothesis to $\T^r$ and $\T^{\ell}$, this yields:
   \begin{align*}
   \ER[\T] & = \ER[\T^r] + \ER[\T^{\ell}] \\
    & = 1 + \des[\Psi(\T^r)] + 1 + \des[\Psi(\T^{\ell})] \\
    & = 1 + \des[\Psi(\T)],
   \end{align*}  
  as desired. This completes the proof of the theorem.
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% SECTION 4 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Counting CNATs according to their associated permutations}\label{sec:cnat_count}

In~\cite{CO} the authors were interested in the numbers $\cnat[\pi]$ enumerated in Theorem~\ref{thm:cnat_minrec}. More specifically, they were interested in how many permutations $\pi$ had the same fixed number of associated CNATs. For $n,k \geq 1$, we define
$ B(n, k) := \{\pi \in S_n;\, \cnat[\pi] = k \} $
to be the set of $n$-permutations associated with exactly $k$ CNATs, and $b(n,k) := \vert B(n,k) \vert$ to be the number of such permutations. For brevity we will simply say that a permutation $\pi \in B(n,k)$ \emph{has} $k$ CNATs, and refer to elements of $B(n,k)$ as permutations \emph{with} (exactly) $k$ CNATs. The main goal of this section is to prove a number of conjectures on the enumeration sequence $\big( b(n,k) \big)_{n, k \geq 1}$ from~\cite{CO}.

\subsection{Linking permutations with one and two CNATs}\label{subsec:B(n,1)_B(n+1,2)}

In this part, we establish a bijection between \emph{marked} permutations with a single CNAT, and permutations with $2$ CNATs (Theorem~\ref{thm:Insert_B(n,1)toB(n+1,2)}). We begin by describing the set $B(n,1)$ of permutations with a single CNAT. In~\cite{CO}, the authors gave a characterisation of this set in terms of so-called 	\emph{L-subsets}. We first give an equivalent characterisation in terms of \emph{quadrants}. For an (irreducible) $n$-permutation $\pi$, we let $\Pi = \{ (i, \pi_i); i \in [n] \}$ be the points in the graphical representation of $\pi$. Given an index $k \in \{2, \cdots, n\}$, we partition $\Pi$ into four quadrants, called $k$-quadrants when the index $k$ needs to be explicit, as follows. 
\begin{itemize}
\item The upper-left quadrant is $\Pi_{<k, <k} := \Pi \cap \Big( [1, k-1] \times [1, k-1] \Big)$.
\item The lower-left quadrant is $\Pi_{<k, \geq k} := \Pi \cap \Big( [1, k-1] \times [k, n] \Big)$.
\item The upper-right quadrant is $\Pi_{\geq k, <k} := \Pi \cap \Big( [k, n] \times [1, k-1] \Big)$.
\item The lower-right quadrant is $\Pi_{\geq k, \geq k} := \Pi \cap \Big( [k, n] \times [k, n] \Big)$.
\end{itemize}
This partition is illustrated on Figure~\ref{fig:quad_partition} below, with $\pi = 561243$ and $k=4$.

\caption{The partition of a permutation's graphical representation into four quadrants.\label{fig:quad_partition}}
\end{figure}

Note that since $\pi$ is a permutation, the first $k-1$ columns or rows of its graphical representation must have $k-1$ dots in total. Therefore we have 
\beq\label{eq:quad_eq}
\left\vert \Pi_{<k, < k} \right\vert + \left\vert \Pi_{<k, \geq k} \right\vert = \left\vert \Pi_{<k, < k} \right\vert + \left\vert \Pi_{\geq k, < k} \right\vert = k-1,
\eeq 
so that $\left\vert \Pi_{<k, \geq k} \right\vert = \left\vert \Pi_{ \geq k, < k} \right\vert$. Moreover, this number must be strictly positive, since otherwise $\pi$ would induce a permutation on $[k-1]$, and therefore be reducible. In words, given an (irreducible) $n$-permutation $\pi$, and an index $k \in \{2, \cdots, n\}$, the lower-left and upper-right quadrants are non-empty, and have the same number of dots.

\begin{definition}\label{def:quad_cond}
Let $n \geq 2$. We say that an $n$-permutation $\pi$ satisfies the \emph{quadrant condition} if
\beq\label{eq:quad_cond}
\forall k \in \{2, \cdots, n\}, \ \left\vert \Pi_{<k, \geq k} \right\vert = \left\vert \Pi_{ \geq k, < k} \right\vert = 1.
\eeq
That is, a permutation satisfies the quadrant condition when every lower-left quadrant (equivalently upper-right quadrant) has exactly one dot.
\end{definition}

We now state our characterisation of the set $B(n,1)$.

\begin{proposition}\label{pro:B(n,1)_quadrants}
Let $\pi$ be a permutation. Then $\pi$ has a unique CNAT if, and only if, $\pi$ satisfies the quadrant condition and has no fixed point.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Let $\pi$ be an $n$-permutation. For $j \in [n]$, we define the $j$-th \emph{L-subset} $L_j$ of a permutation $\pi$ by $L_j := \Pi_{<j+1, <j+1} \setminus \Pi_{<j, <j}$. Therorem~3.11 in~\cite{CO} states that a permutation has a unique CNAT if, and only if, $\pi$ has no fixed point, $\vert L_1 \vert = 0$, $\vert L_n \vert = 2$, and $\vert L_j \vert = 1$ for all $j \in \{2, \cdots, n-1 \}$. We show that this is equivalent to $\pi$ having no fixed point and satisfying the quadrant condition.

Suppose first that $\pi$ satisfies the above conditions on its L-subsets, and fix some $k \in \{2,\cdots,n\}$. Then we have $ \left\vert \Pi_{<k,<k} \right\vert = \sum\limits_{j=1}^{k-1} \vert L_j \vert = k-2$. By Equation~\eqref{eq:quad_eq} this implies that $\left\vert \Pi_{<k, \geq k} \right\vert = \left\vert \Pi_{\geq k, < k} \right\vert = k-1 - \left\vert \Pi_{<k, < k} \right\vert = 1$. Thus $\pi$ satisfies the quadrant condition as desired.

Conversely, suppose that $\pi$ satisfies the quadrant condition, and has no fixed point. Owing to the fact that $\pi$ is irreducible, we have $\vert L_1\vert =0$ (we cannot have $\pi_1 = 1$). Moreover there is always exactly one dot in the rightmost column $n$ and exactly one dot in the bottom-most row $n$, which both belong to the L-subset $L_n$. Again, $\pi$ is irreducible, so these dots must be distinct (we cannot have $\pi_n = n$, leading to the equality $\vert L_n\vert=2$. It therefore remains to show that
\beq\label{eq:L-condition}
\forall j \in \{2, \cdots, n-1\}, \, \vert L_j \vert = 1.
\eeq

Seeking contradiction, suppose that this is not the case. Because $\pi$ is a permutation, there are $n$ dots in total in $\Pi$, and therefore $(n-2)$ dots in $\bigcup\limits_{j = 2}^{n-1} L_j$. Thus if the L-condition~\eqref{eq:L-condition} is not satisfied, there must exist $j \in \{2,\cdots,n-1\}$ such that the $j$-th L-subset $L_j$ is empty. In that case, the dot in the column $j$ will be placed below row $j$, i.e.\ in column $j$ of the lower-left quadrant $\Pi_{<j+1, \geq j+1}$. Now since $L_j$ is empty, each dot located in the first $(j-1)$ columns should be placed either in the upper-left quadrant $\Pi_{<j, <j}$ or the lower-left quadrant $\Pi_{<j+1, \geq j+1}$ but before the column $j$. Because $\pi$ is irreducible, there must be at most $(j-2)$ dots in the upper-left quadrant $\Pi_{<j, <j}$, which means that there must be at least one dot placed in the first $(j-1)$ columns of the lower-left quadrant $\Pi_{<j+1, \geq j+1}$, say in some column $j' < j$. Hence, in the lower-left quadrant $\Pi_{<j+1, \geq j+1}$ there are at least two dots: one in column $j'$ and one in column $j$. This contradicts the fact that $\pi$ satisfies the quadrant condition. Therefore, the L-condition~\eqref{eq:L-condition} is satisfied, and $\pi$ has a unique CNAT by~\cite[Theorem~3.11]{CO}.
\end{proof}

For $n \geq 1$, and an index $j \in \{2,\cdots,n\}$, we now define the \emph{insertion operation} $\Insert[j] : S_n \rightarrow S_{n+1}$ as follows. Given a $n$-permutation $\pi$, we construct $\pi' := \Insert[j](\pi)$ by inserting a fixed point $j$ into the $n$-permutation $\pi$, and increasing the labels of all letters $k \geq j$ in the original permutation $\pi$ by $1$. For example, if $\pi = 521634$ and $j=3$, then $\pi' = 62\textbf{3}1745$ (fixed point in bold). It is straightforward to check that $\Insert[j](\pi)$ is irreducible if, and only if, $\pi$ is irreducible.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:Insert_B(n,1)toB(n+1,2)}
Let $n \geq 2$. Define a map $\Phi : \{2,\cdots,n\} \times S_{n} \rightarrow S_{n+1}$ by $\Phi(j, \pi) := \Insert[j](\pi)$ for all $j \in \{2,\cdots,n\}$ and $\pi \in S_{n}$. Then $\Phi$ is a bijection from $\{2,\cdots,n\} \times B(n,1)$ to $B(n+1,2)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{remark}\label{rem:marked_B(n,1)toB(n+1,2)}
The insertion index $j \in \{2, \cdots, n\}$ can be thought of as \emph{marking} the ``space'' between $\pi_{j-1}$ and $\pi_j$ in $\pi$, with the insertion operation corresponding to inserting a fixed point in the marked space. The product set $\{2,\cdots,n\} \times B(n,1)$ can then be thought of as permutations with a single CNAT, marked in such a space. Hence the bijection of Theorem~\ref{thm:Insert_B(n,1)toB(n+1,2)} can be interpreted as a bijection between marked $n$-permutations with a single CNAT, and $(n+1)$-permutations with two CNATs.
\end{remark}

From~\cite[Corollary~3.12]{CO}, we have $b(n,1) = 2^{n-2}$ for any $n \geq 2$. This formula is also implicit from the combination of Theorem~\ref{thm:cnat_minrec} and \cite[Theorem~1]{AH}. Indeed, in that work the authors show that the number of $n$-permutations whose graphs are trees is $2^{n-2}$, and trees are the only graphs with exactly one minimal recurrent configuration for the ASM (Lemma~\ref{lem:minrec_tree}). Together with Theorem~\ref{thm:Insert_B(n,1)toB(n+1,2)}, this enumeration formula immediately implies the following, which answers in the affirmative the conjecture from~\cite{CO} that $\big( b(n,2) \big)_{n \geq 2}$ is given by Sequence~A001787 in~\cite{OEIS}.

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:b(n,2)}
For any $n\geq2$, we have $b(n,2) = (n-2)\cdot 2^{(n-3)}$.
\end{corollary}

To prove Theorem~\ref{thm:Insert_B(n,1)toB(n+1,2)}, we first state and prove two lemmas on the insertion operation $\Insert[j]$ and the set $B(n,2)$.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:k_Insert_2k}
Let $n \geq 2$, and $j \in \{2,\cdots,n\}$. For any $k \geq 1$, if $\pi$ is an $n$-permutation with $k$ CNATs, then $\Insert[j](\pi)$ is an $(n+1)$-permutation with at least $2k$ CNATs. Moreover, if $\pi$ has a single CNAT (i.e. $k=1$), then $\Insert[j](\pi)$ has exactly $2$ CNATs.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $T \in \CNAT[\pi]$ be a CNAT with permutation $\pi$. Define $T'$ to be the ``partial'' CNAT obtained by inserting a new dot $d$ in cell $(j,j)$ and shifting all dots in cells $(x,y)$ with $x \geq j$, resp.\ $y \geq j$, one column rightwards, resp.\ one row downwards (see Figure~\ref{fig:partial_cnat}). Since the lower-left and upper-right $j$-quadrants of $\pi$ are non-empty, $T'$ must have at least one leaf dot $d_1$ below and to the left of $d$, and one leaf dot $d_2$ above and to the right of $d$. The path from $d_1$, resp.\ $d_2$, to the root must cross row $j$, resp.\ column $j$, in some column $j_1 < j$, resp.\ row $j_2 < j$. Let $T_1$, resp.\ $T_2$, be $T'$ with an extra dot in the cell $(j_1,j)$ (i.e.\ in row $j$ and column $j_1$), resp.\ in the cell $(j, j_2)$. Then $T_1$ and $T_2$ are two CNATs with permutation $\pi' := \Insert[j](\pi)$, and the maps $T \mapsto T_1$ and $T \mapsto T_2$ are both injective. This shows that if $\pi$ has $k$ CNATs, then $\pi'$ has at least $2k$ CNATs, as desired. 

The above construction is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:insert_2k} below. Here we start with a CNAT $T$ and associated permutation $\pi$ (Figure~\ref{fig:cnat_insert_2k}). We then show in Figures~\ref{fig:T1} and \ref{fig:T2} possible choices for the two CNATs $T_1$ and $T_2$ with permutation $\pi' = \Insert[4](\pi)$. Note that here in each case we actually had two choices for the new edge in the CNATs $T_1$ and $T_2$, since there were two edges of $T$ crossing row $4$ to the left of the new leaf dot (in columns $1$ and $2$), and two edges crossing column $4$ above the new leaf dot (in rows $2$ and $3$).

\end{figure}

Now suppose that $k=1$, i.e.\ that $T$ is the unique CNAT associated with the permutation $\pi$. Let $T'$ be a CNAT associated with $\pi'$. $T'$ has a leaf dot $d$ in cell $(j,j)$ by definition. Moreover, in $T'$, there must be either a dot $d_1$ in a cell $(j_1, j)$ for some $j_1 < j$ (to the left of $d$), or a dot $d_2$ in a cell $(j, j_2)$ for some $j_2 < j$ (above $d$).

First, consider the case where there is a dot $d_1$ to the left of $d$. Any such dot $d_1$ must have a leaf dot below it since the tree $T'$ is complete. By Lemma~\ref{pro:B(n,1)_quadrants}, this leaf dot must be the unique dot in the lower-left quadrant $\Pi'_{<j+1, \geq j+1}$ of $\pi'$ (equivalently, the unique dot in the lower-left quadrant $\Pi_{<j, \geq j}$ of $\pi$). This implies that the dot $d_1$ is unique, i.e.\ that there is only one dot to the left of $d$ in its row. It is then straightforward to check that deleting the row and column $j$ in the CNAT $T'$ yields a CNAT $T$ with permutation $\pi$. Since $T$ is unique, this means that there is only one CNAT $T'$ with permutation $\pi'$ such that the leaf dot $d$ in cell $(j,j)$ has a dot to its left. Analogously, there is only one CNAT $T'$ with permutation $\pi'$ such that the leaf dot $d$ in cell $(j,j)$ has a dot above it. Since every CNAT $T'$ must be in one of these two cases by definition of a CNAT, this implies that $\cnat[\pi'] = 2$, as desired. 
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:B(n,2)_quad_cond}
For $n \geq 2$, let $\pi \in B(n,2)$ be an $n$-permutation with exactly $2$ CNATs. Then $\pi$ satisfies the quadrant condition from Definition~\ref{def:quad_cond}.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $\pi$ be an $n$-permutation, and $k \in \{2, \cdots, n\}$ an index. We show that if the lower-left and upper-right $k$-quadrants have at least $2$ points, then we can construct at least $3$ CNATs with associated permutation $\pi$. The construction is similar to the one in the proof of Lemma~\ref{lem:k_Insert_2k}, so we allow ourselves to be a little briefer here.

Let $d_1, d_1'$, resp.\ $d_2, d_2'$, be two dots in the lower-left, resp.\ upper-right, quadrant. We assume that the column of $d_1$ is to the left of that of $d_1'$, and the row of $d_2$ above that of $d_2'$. Let $\pi'$ be the permutation obtained from $\pi$ by removing the rows and columns containing $d_1'$ and $d_2'$ from its graphical representation. Let $T$ be a CNAT with permutation $\pi'$\footnote{See Remark~\ref{rem:B(n,2)_quad_cond} for why the assumption that $T$ exists can be justified.}. As in the proof of Lemma~\ref{lem:k_Insert_2k}, we let $T'$ be the ``partial'' CNAT obtained from $T$ by re-inserting the leaf dots $d_1'$ and $d_2'$.

Let $c = (i', j')$ denote the cell in the same column $i'$ as $d_1'$ and row $j'$ as $d_2'$. By construction this cell is in the upper-left $k$-quadrant of $\pi$. Since $d_1$ is in some column $i < i'$ (to the left of $d_1'$), the path from $d_1$ to the root in the partial CNAT $T'$ must cross the row $j'$ in some cell $c_{\mathrm{left}}$ to the left of $c$. Similarly, since the row $j$ of $d_2$ is above the row $j'$ of $d_2'$, the path from $d_2$ to the root must cross the column $i'$ in some cell $c_{\mathrm{up}}$ above $c$. Then putting internal dots in any two of the three cells $c, c_{\mathrm{left}}, c_{\mathrm{up}}$ will yield a CNAT with permutation $\pi$. Since there are three such possibilities, this implies that $\pi$ has at least three CNATs, which completes the proof.
\end{proof}

These constructions are illustrated on Figure~\ref{fig:B(n,2)_quad_cond} below. Figure~\ref{fig:perm_not_quad_cond} shows the permutation $\pi$ with the $4$-quadrants. The lower-left and upper-right have two dots. The green dots are $d_1'$ (in cell $(2,6)$) and $d_2'$ (in cell $(6,3)$). Figure~\ref{fig:partial_not_quad_cond} shows a partial CNAT $T'$ obtained by constructing a CNAT $T$ with permutation $\pi' = 4132$ (which is $\pi$ with $d_1'$ and $d_2'$ deleted) and re-inserting the dots $d_1', d_2'$, but leaving them unconnected. Then the cell $c = (2,3)$ is in the same column as $d_1'$ and row as $d_2'$. The cell $c_{\mathrm{left}} = (1,3)$ is where the path from $d_1$ in cell $(1,5)$ crosses the row $3$ of cell $c$. The cell $c_\mathrm{up} = (2,2)$ is where the path from $d_2$ in cell $(5,2)$ crosses the column $2$ of cell $c$. Figures~\ref{fig:d_dl}, \ref{fig:d_du} and \ref{fig:du_dl} then show the three possible CNATs with permutation $\pi$ obtained by choosing to put dots in two of the cells $c, c_{\mathrm{left}}, c_{\mathrm{up}}$, with the inserted dots and edges drawn in green each time.

\begin{remark}\label{rem:B(n,2)_quad_cond}
There is a slight imprecision in the proof of Lemma~\ref{lem:B(n,2)_quad_cond}, when we assume that the permutation $\pi'$ obtained by deleting $d_1'$ and $d_2'$ from $\pi$ has a CNAT, which is equivalent to $\pi'$ being irreducible. This may in fact not be the case here, for example if we had chosen $\pi = 451263$ above. In this case deleting the dots in cells $(2,5)$ and $(6,3)$ would yield $\pi' = 3124$ which is reducible, so does not have a CNAT. Visually, the only way of connecting the leaf dot in cell $(5,6)$ is to a dot in cell $(5,3)$, i.e.\ to the dot immediately to the left of the leaf $d_1'$ (which is in cell $(6,3)$) in its column, hence the deletion of $d_1'$ is problematic here. The solution is to also delete the leaf dot in cell $(5,6)$, leaving us with a permutation $\pi' = 312$ which is now irreducible, so has a CNAT.

In general, the dot $d_1'$ can be safely deleted if deleting the vertex $j$ of its row index does not disconnect the corresponding permutation graph $G_{\pi}$. Otherwise, if deleting $j$ from $G_{\pi}$ disconnects the graph, we consider the connected components which do \emph{not} contain the vertex corresponding to the second dot $d_1$ in the lower-left quadrant. When we delete $d_1'$, we then also delete the dots whose vertices are in these connected components. We do the same when deleting the dot $d_2'$. The rest of the proof is unchanged.
\end{remark}

Combined with Proposition~\ref{pro:B(n,1)_quadrants}, Lemma~\ref{lem:B(n,2)_quad_cond} implies the following.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:B(n,2)_fixedpoint}
Let $n \geq 2$, and $\pi \in B(n,2)$ an $n$-permutation with exactly $2$ CNATs. Then $\pi$ has a unique fixed point $j \in \{2, \cdots, n-1\}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Suppose $\pi$ is a permutation with $2$ CNATs. Based on Lemma~\ref{lem:B(n,2)_quad_cond}, $\pi$ satisfies the quadrant condition. However, from Proposition~\ref{pro:B(n,1)_quadrants}, if $\pi$ has no fixed point, then it will have a single CNAT. Hence, there must be at least one fixed point in $\pi$. However, if $\pi$ has two fixed points $j$ and $j'$, then we can write $\pi = \Insert[j]\big( \Insert[j'](\pi')\big)$ for some permutation $\pi'$. By Lemma~\ref{lem:k_Insert_2k}, we then have $\cnat[\pi] \geq 4 \cdot \cnat[\pi'] \geq 4$, which contradicts the fact that $\pi$ has $2$ CNATs.
\end{proof}

Much like Proposition~\ref{pro:B(n,1)_quadrants} for $B(n,1)$, Lemmas~\ref{lem:B(n,2)_quad_cond} and \ref{lem:B(n,2)_fixedpoint} in fact give a characterisation of the sets $B(n,2)$, as follows.

\begin{proposition}\label{pro:B(n,2)_characterisation}
Let $\pi$ be a permutation. Then $\pi$ has exactly $2$ CNATs if, and only if, $\pi$ satisfies the quadrant condition and has a unique fixed point $j \geq 2$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
If $\pi$ has exactly $2$ CNATs, then it satisfies the quadrant condition by Lemma~\ref{lem:B(n,2)_quad_cond} and has a unique fixed point $j \geq 2$ by Lemma~\ref{lem:B(n,2)_fixedpoint}. Conversely, if $\pi$ satisfies the quadrant condition and has a unique fixed point $j$, then deleting $j$ from $\pi$ yields a permutation $\pi'$ with no fixed point which also satisfies the quadrant condition. Thus $\pi'$ has a unique CNAT by Proposition~\ref{pro:B(n,1)_quadrants}. Since $\pi = \Insert[j](\pi')$ by construction, we deduce that $\pi$ has exactly $2$ CNATs by Lemma~\ref{lem:k_Insert_2k}.
\end{proof}

Theorem~\ref{thm:Insert_B(n,1)toB(n+1,2)} now follows straightforwardly from the two Characterisation Propositions~\ref{pro:B(n,1)_quadrants} and \ref{pro:B(n,2)_characterisation}. Indeed, we have shown that permutations with a single CNAT are those which satisfy the quadrant condition and have no fixed point, while permutations with two CNATs are those that satisfy the quadrant condition and have a single fixed point. Since the insertion or deletion of a fixed point does not affect whether a permutation satisfies the quadrant condition or not, it is immediate that the map $\Phi$ defined by $\Phi(j, \pi) := \Insert[j](\pi)$ is indeed a bijection from $\{2,\cdots,n\} \times B(n,1)$ to $B(n+1, 2)$.

\subsection{Linking permutations with two and three CNATs}\label{subsec:B(n,2)_B(n+1,3)}

In this part, we establish a bijection between $n$-permutations with $2$ CNATs and $(n+1)$-permutations with $3$ CNATs (Theorem~\ref{thm:biject_B(n,2)toB(n+1,3)}). We begin by giving characterisations of the sets $B(n,2)$ and $B(n,3)$ in terms of permutation patterns, as introduced at the end of Section~\ref{subsec:perms_prelims}.

\begin{proposition}\label{pro:pattern_B(n,2)}
Let $\pi$ be a permutation. Then $\pi$ has exactly $2$ CNATs if, and only if, $\pi$ contains a unique occurrence of the $321$ pattern and avoids 3412. Moreover, if $\pi_i, \pi_j, \pi_k$ is the unique occurrence of $321$, with $i < j < k$, then we have $\pi_j = j$, i.e.\ $j$ is the unique fixed point of $\pi$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
First suppose that $\pi$ contains a unique occurrence of the $321$ pattern, and avoids $3412$. By Proposition~\ref{pro:perm_patterns_cycles}, this implies that the permutation graph $G_{\pi}$ of $G$ is a decorated $3$-cycle. From Lemma~\ref{lem:minrec_dec_cycle}, we then obtain $\minrec[G] = 3-1 = 2$, which implies by Theorem~\ref{thm:cnat_minrec}, that $\pi$ has exactly $2$ CNATs.

Now suppose that $\pi$ has exactly $2$ CNATs. We know from Lemma~\ref{lem:B(n,2)_fixedpoint} that $\pi$ has a (unique) fixed point $j \in \{2, \cdots, n-1\}$. Consider the lower-left $j$-quadrant $\Pi_{<j, \geq j}$. By Proposition~\ref{pro:B(n,2)_characterisation} it has a unique dot, and this dot cannot be in row $j$, since the dot in row $j$ is in column $j$. Thus this dot must be $(i, \pi_i)$ with $i < j$ and $\pi_i > j = \pi_j$. Similarly, the upper-right $j$-quadrant $\Pi_{ \geq j, < j}$ has a unique dot which is not in column $j$, so is therefore $(k, \pi_k)$ with $k > j$ and $\pi_k < j = \pi_j$. In other words, $\pi_i, \pi_j = j, \pi_k$ forms a $321$ pattern in the permutation $\pi$, or equivalently induces a $3$-cycle in the permutation graph $G_{\pi}$. We claim that there can be no other occurrences of $321$, or any occurrence of $3412$, in the permutation $\pi$.

Indeed, if $\pi$ contains an occurrence of $3412$, then by Lemma~\ref{lem:cnat_pattern}, we have $\cnat[\pi] \geq \cnat[3412] = 3$, which is a contradiction (applying Lemma~\ref{lem:minrec_dec_cycle} to the $4$-cycle $G_{3412}$). Now suppose $G$ contains a second occurrence $\pi_{i'}, \pi_{j'}, \pi_{k'}$ of the pattern $321$. Similarly to the proof of Lemma~\ref{lem:minrec_dec_cycle}, we first construct a subgraph $G^0$ of $G_{\pi}$ whose edges are the union of the edges of a given spanning subtree $G'$ of $G_{\pi}$ and of the $3$-cycle on $\pi_{i'}, \pi_{j'}, \pi_{k'}$. The graph $G^0$ is a decorated $3$-cycle, so that $\minrec[G^0] = 2$ by Lemma~\ref{lem:minrec_dec_cycle}. To obtain $G_{\pi}$ from $G^0$ we need to add at least one edge of the $3$-cycle on $\pi_i, \pi_k, \pi_k$, since by construction this cycle is not contained in $G^0$. Lemma~\ref{lem:add_edge_minrec} therefore yields $2 = \minrec[G^0] < \minrec[G_{\pi}] = \cnat[\pi]$, which is a contradiction (applying Theorem~\ref{thm:cnat_minrec}).

We have therefore shown that $\pi$ has exactly $2$ CNATs if, and only if, $\pi$ contains a unique occurrence of the $321$ pattern and avoids $3412$. Moreover, in the above, we also showed that when $\pi$ has $2$ CNATs, the fixed point $j$ of $\pi$ is the middle point in the (unique) occurrence of $321$. This therefore completes the proof of the proposition. 

\end{proof}

Figure~\ref{fig:321_B(n,2)} illustrates the $321$ pattern structure $\pi_i, \pi_j, \pi_k$ in $\pi \in B(n,2)$.

\begin{proposition}\label{pro:pattern_B(n,3)}
Let $\pi$ be a permutation. Then $\pi$ has exactly $3$ CNATs if, and only if, $\pi$ contains a unique occurrence of the $3412$ pattern and avoids $321$. Moreover, if $\pi_i, \pi_j, \pi_k, \pi_{\ell}$ is the occurrence of $3412$, with $i < j < k < \ell$, then we have $\pi_i = \pi_{\ell} + 1$ and $k = j+1$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}

First suppose that $\pi$ contains a unique occurrence of the $3412$ pattern, and avoids $321$. By Proposition~\ref{pro:perm_patterns_cycles}, this implies that the permutation graph $G_{\pi}$ of $G$ is a decorated $4$-cycle. From Lemma~\ref{lem:minrec_dec_cycle}, we then obtain $\minrec[G] = 4-1 = 3$, which implies by Theorem~\ref{thm:cnat_minrec}, that $\pi$ has exactly $3$ CNATs.

We now show the converse. Let $\pi$ be a permutation with exactly $3$ CNATs. We claim that $G := G_{\pi}$ must be a decorated $4$-cycle. Assume for now this claim proved. Then Proposition~\ref{pro:perm_patterns_cycles} implies that $\pi$ must indeed contain a unique occurrence of $3412$ (corresponding to the induced $4$-cycle of $G_{\pi}$), and avoids $321$ (since $G$ does not induce a $3$-cycle). It therefore remains to prove that $G$ is indeed a decorated $4$-cycle in this case.

First, note that if $G$ is a tree, then $\cnat[\pi] = \minrec[G] = 1 \neq 3$, so that $G$ must contain at least one cycle. If $G$ contains a unique cycle, which has length $3$, then by Lemma~\ref{lem:minrec_dec_cycle} we would have $\cnat[\pi] = \minrec[G] = 2 \neq 3$. Therefore $G$ either contains at least two cycles, or a cycle of length at least $4$. If $G$ contains a cycle of length $5$ or more, then $G$ can be constructed from the $5$-cycle through a series of edge additions or edge duplications. This would imply that $\cnat[\pi] = \minrec[G] \geq \minrec[C_5] = 4$, which is a contradiction (applying Lemmas~\ref{lem:add_edge_minrec} and \ref{lem:dupl_edge_minrec} to get the inequality, and Lemma~\ref{lem:minrec_dec_cycle} for the right-hand equality). Similarly, if $G$ contains a $4$-cycle, to get $\minrec[G] = 3$ this must be the unique cycle contained in $G$, i.e.\ $G$ is a decorated $4$-cycle. Otherwise edge additions are necessary to construct $G$ from $C_4$, and these strictly increase the number of minimal recurrent configurations.

It therefore remains to show that $G$ cannot contain two $3$-cycles. We again seek contradiction. If $G$ has two $3$-cycles which share an edge, then the ``outer cycle'' is a $4$-cycle (see Figure~\ref{fig:k=4_chord11}), and we are in the above case. We therefore only need to consider the case where $G$ contains at least two edge-disjoint $3$-cycles. But such a graph can be constructed through a series of edge additions starting from the ``butterfly'' graph $B$ consisting of two $3$-cycles joined at a vertex (see Figure~\ref{fig:butterfly}), and it is straightforward to check that we have $\minrec[B] = 4$. As above, applying Lemma~\ref{lem:add_edge_minrec} then gives $\cnat[\pi] = \minrec[G] \geq \minrec[B] = 4$, which gives the desired contradiction. This completes the proof of our claim that if $\pi$ has exactly $3$ CNATs, the associated permutation graph $G_{\pi}$ is a decorated $4$-cycle, as desired.

\end{figure}

We now prove the second statement of the proposition. Let $\pi_i, \pi_j, \pi_k, \pi_{\ell}$ be the occurrence of the $3412$ pattern in $\pi \in B(n,3)$, with $i < j < k < \ell$. We wish to show that there are no dots between columns $j$ and $k$ (i.e.\ $k = j+1$), and no dots between rows $\pi_{\ell}$ and $\pi_i$ (i.e.\ $\pi_i = \pi_{\ell} + 1$). Let us first show that $k = j+1$, i.e.\ that there are no dots between columns $j$ and $k$. Otherwise, let $m$ be such that $j < m < k$. We show that the dot $(m, \pi_m)$ is either part of an occurrence of the $321$ pattern, or of the $3412$ pattern, which contradicts the above. There are three possible cases to consider.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $\pi_m < \pi_k$, then $\pi_i, \pi_j, \pi_m, \pi_{\ell}$ is an occurrence of the $3412$ pattern.
\item If $\pi_m > \pi_j$, then $\pi_i, \pi_m, \pi_k, \pi_{\ell}$ is an occurrence of the $3412$ pattern.
\item If $\pi_k < \pi_m < \pi_j$, then $\pi_j, \pi_m, \pi_k$ is an occurrence of the $321$ pattern.
\end{enumerate}

We show similarly that $\pi_i = \pi_{\ell} + 1$. Otherwise, let $m$ be such that $\pi_{\ell} < \pi_m < \pi_i$. As above, there are three cases to consider.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $m < i$, then $\pi_m, \pi_j, \pi_k, \pi_{\ell}$ is an occurrence of the $3412$ pattern.
\item If $m > \ell$, then $\pi_i, \pi_j, \pi_k, \pi_m$ is an occurrence of the $3412$ pattern.
\item If $i < m < \ell$, then $\pi_i, \pi_m, \pi_{\ell}$ is an occurrence of the $321$ pattern.
\end{enumerate}
As above, these all contradict the fact that $\pi_i, \pi_j, \pi_k, \pi_{\ell}$ is the unique occurrence of $3412$ in $\pi$, and that $\pi$ avoids 321. This concludes the proof.
  
\end{proof}

Figure~\ref{fig:3412_B(n,3)} illustrates this structure of the unique $3412$ pattern $\pi_i, \pi_j, \pi_k, \pi_{\ell}$ in $\pi \in B(n,3)$, which has $\pi_i=\pi_{\ell}+1$ and $k=j+1$.

\end{figure}

\begin{remark}\label{rem:construct_cnats_B(n,3)_pattern}
We can directly construct the three CNATs corresponding to the permutation $\pi$ based on the $3412$ pattern of Figure~\ref{fig:3412_B(n,3)}. The construction is similar to that of Figure~\ref{fig:B(n,2)_quad_cond}. Namely, we define three cells $c := (j,\pi_{\ell}), c_{\mathrm{left}} := (i,\pi_{\ell}), c_{\mathrm{up}} := (j,\pi_k)$. Deleting the dots $(j, \pi_j)$ and $(\ell, \pi_{\ell})$ from the permutation $\pi$ yields a permutation $\pi'$ which has a single CNAT $T'$ (the permutation graph $G_{\pi'}$ is acyclic, since $\pi'$ avoids $321$ and $3412$)\footnote{As in Remark~\ref{rem:B(n,2)_quad_cond} we are slightly abusive here, since we need to take care not to disconnect the permutation graph.}. The three CNATs associated with $T$ are then constructed from $T'$ by adding dots in any two of the three cells $c = (j, \pi_{\ell}),\ c_{\mathrm{left}} = (i, \pi_{\ell}),\ c_{\mathrm{up}} = (j, \pi_k)$, as on Figure~\ref{fig:B(n,2)_quad_cond}.
\end{remark}

As in Section~\ref{subsec:B(n,1)_B(n+1,2)}, it is possible to give a characterisation of $B(n,3)$ in terms of quadrants. We state the result without proof here, since the proof involves a case-by-case study of the numerous possibilities where a permutation does \emph{not} satisfy the stated condition on its quadrants. Indeed, we would have to consider a permutation with two separate values $k, k'$ having two dots in their lower-left and upper-right quadrants, and there are many possibilities for where these dots are located. We consider that such a proof does not add any real value to this paper, so prefer leaving it as an exercise to the dedicated reader.

\begin{proposition}\label{pro:characterisation_B(n,3)_quadrants}
Let $\pi$ be an $n$-permutation for some $n \geq 4$. Then $\pi$ has exactly $3$ CNATs if, and only, if, the following three conditions are all satisfied.
\begin{enumerate}
\item There exists a unique value of $k \in \{2, \cdots n\}$ such that the lower-left and upper-right $k$-quadrants of $\Pi$ have exactly two dots.
\item All other lower-left and upper-right $k'$-quadrants, for $k' \neq k$, have a single dot.
\item The permutation $\pi$ has no fixed point.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

With Propositions~\ref{pro:pattern_B(n,2)} and \ref{pro:pattern_B(n,3)}, we are now equipped to define the bijection between $B(n,2)$ and $B(n+1,3)$. Let $\pi \in B(n,2)$ be an $n$-permutation with $2$ CNATs, and suppose that $\pi_i, \pi_j = j, \pi_k$ is the unique occurrence of the pattern $321$ in $\pi$, with $i < j < k$. We first define an $(n+1)$-permutation $\tilde{\pi}$ by $\tilde{\pi} := \Insert[j+1](\pi)$. Since $\pi$ has a unique occurrence of the pattern $321$, given by $\pi_i, \pi_j = j, \pi_k$, it follows by construction that $\tilde{\pi}$ has a unique occurrence of the pattern $4231$, given by $\tilde{\pi}_i = \pi_i + 1, \tilde{\pi}_j = j, \tilde{\pi}_{j+1} = j+1, \tilde{\pi}_{k+1} = \pi_k$. Moreover, $\tilde{\pi}$ avoids $3412$ (since $\pi$ does), and has exactly two occurrences of $321$, given by $\tilde{\pi}_i, \tilde{\pi}_j, \tilde{\pi}_{k+1}$ and $\tilde{\pi}_i, \tilde{\pi}_{j+1}, \tilde{\pi}_{k+1}$. We then define a permutation $\pi'$, obtained from $\tilde{\pi}$ by changing the $4231$ pattern to a $3412$ pattern (on the same elements), and leaving all other elements unchanged. More formally, we have:
\beq\label{eq:def_bij_B(n,2)_B(n,3)}
\begin{cases}
\pi'_i = \tilde{\pi}_{j+1} = j+1 \\
\pi'_j = \tilde{\pi}_i = \pi_i + 1 \\
\pi'_{j+1} = \tilde{\pi}_{k+1} = \pi_k \\
\pi'_{k+1} = \tilde{\pi}_j = j \\
\pi'_{\ell} = \tilde{\pi}_{\ell} \qquad \text{for all other values of } \ell
\end{cases}
\eeq

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:biject_B(n,2)toB(n+1,3)}
Let $n \geq 3$. For a permutation $\pi \in B(n,2)$, define $\pi'$ as in Equation~\eqref{eq:def_bij_B(n,2)_B(n,3)}, where $\pi_i, \pi_j = j, \pi_k$ is the unique occurrence of the pattern $321$ in $\pi$, and $\tilde{\pi} := \Insert[j+1](\pi)$. Then the map $\pi \mapsto \pi'$ is a bijection from $B(n,2)$ to $B(n+1,3)$.
\end{theorem}

The construction $\pi \mapsto \pi'$ is illustrated on Figure~\ref{fig:B(n,2)_B(n+1,3)} below. On the left (Figure~\ref{fig:B(n,2)_321}) we have the occurrence $\pi_i, \pi_j = j, \pi_k$ of $321$ in the permutation $\pi \in B(n,2)$. On the right (Figure~\ref{fig:B(n+1,3)_3412}) we have the occurrence $\pi'_i = \pi_j+1 = j+1, \pi'_j = \pi_i + 1, \pi'_{j+1} = \pi_k, \pi'_{k+1} = \pi_j = j$ of $3412$ in $\pi'$. The other dots of $\pi$ are unchanged in $\pi'$, after the necessary shifting downwards and/or to the right to create a permutation.

Theorem~\ref{thm:biject_B(n,2)toB(n+1,3)} answers in the affirmative Conjecture~6.4 in~\cite{CO}. Combining with Corollary~\ref{cor:b(n,2)} gives the following.

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:b(n,3)}
For any $n \geq 3$, we have $b(n,3) = (n-3)\cdot 2^{(n-4)}$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:biject_B(n,2)toB(n+1,3)}]
Let $\pi \in B(n,2)$. By construction $\pi'$ is an $(n+1)$-permutation. We first show that $\pi' \in B(n+1,3)$, using the Characterisation Proposition~\ref{pro:pattern_B(n,3)}. We do this through a \emph{block decomposition} of the permutations $\pi$ and $\pi'$, refining Figure~\ref{fig:B(n,2)_B(n+1,3)}. This block decomposition is illustrated on Figure~\ref{fig:block_decomp_perm} below. The unlabelled blocks are empty, since otherwise we would get forbidden patterns. For example, if a block of $\pi$ to the left of column $j$ and below row $j$ contained a dot, this would form an occurrence of $321$ with $\pi_j$ and $\pi_k$.

Now the dots in the upper-left block $A$ cannot form a permutation (since $\pi$ is indecomposable). Therefore if $A$ is non-empty, then $A_1$ or $A_2$ must also be non-empty. However, if there is a dot in $A_1$ and a dot in $A_2$, this would form an occurrence of $3412$ together with $\pi_i$ and $\pi_k$. So at most one of these could be non-empty. Similarly, if the block $B$ is non-empty, then one of $B_1, B_2$ must be non-empty, and moreover at most one of these can be non-empty (even if $B$ is empty). One can check that these block conditions prevent any occurrences of $321$ or $3412$ in $\pi'$, other than the $3412$ already present. By Proposition~\ref{pro:pattern_B(n,3)} we therefore have $\pi' \in B(n+1, 3)$ as desired.

The fact that the map $\pi \mapsto \pi'$ is a bijection is straightforward. Its inverse simply replaces the occurrence of $3412$ in $\pi' \in B(n+1,3)$ which by Proposition~\ref{pro:pattern_B(n,3)} is as in Figure~\ref{fig:B(n+1,3)_3412}, with the occurrence of $321$ in $\pi$ as in Figure\ref{fig:B(n,2)_321}, with suitable relabelling of the other elements. As above, by considering the block decompositions and using Proposition~\ref{pro:pattern_B(n,2)}, we can show that $\pi$ is in $B(n,2)$, as desired. This concludes the proof.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Permutations with $5$ CNATs}\label{subsec:B(n,5)}

In~\cite[Conjecture~6.5]{CO}, it was conjectured that there are no permutations with exactly $5$ CNATs. We answer this conjecture in the affirmative.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:b(n,5)=0}
For any $n \geq 1$, we have $b(n,5) = 0$. That is, there are no permutations (of any length) with exactly $5$ CNATs.
\end{theorem}

For this, we use the enumeration from Theorem~\ref{thm:cnat_minrec}. A permutation graph is associated with exactly $5$ CNATs if, and only if, it has exactly $5$ minimal recurrent configurations for the ASM. It turns out that essentially only one graph satisfies this enumeration (and that it is not a permutation graph). We say that a graph $G$ is \emph{two-connected} if for any vertex $v \in G$, the graph $G \setminus \{v\}$, obtained by removing $v$ and any incident edges from $G$, is connected. 

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:2-conn_cycle}
If $G$ is two-connected with at least $3$ vertices, then every vertex $v$ of $G$ belongs to a cycle.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
A two-connected graph with at least $3$ vertices cannot contain a vertex of degree one, since removing the neighbour of such a vertex would disconnect the graph. Therefore any vertex $v$ in a two-connected graph $G$ must have two distinct neighbours $w_1$ and $w_2$. Now by definition the graph $G \setminus \{v\}$ is connected, so must contain a path from $w_1$ to $w_2$. Connecting this path to the edges $(v, w_1)$ and $(w_2, v)$ in $G$ gives the desired cycle.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:5minrec}
Let $G$ be a two-connected graph. Then $\minrec[G] = 5$ if, and only if, $G$ is the $6$-cycle $C_6$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $G$ be a two-connected graph, and $k$ be the length of its longest cycle. That is, $k$ is the maximal value such that $G$ contains a $k$-cycle $v_0, v_1, \cdots, v_{k-1}, v_k=v_0$ where the first $k-1$ vertices are distinct. With a slight abuse of notation, we denote this $k$-cycle $C_k$. A \emph{chord} of $G$ is then a path between two distinct vertices $v_i, v_j$ of $C_k$ which only intersects $C_k$ at the two end-points $v_i$ and $v_j$. 

We claim that if $G$ is not the $k$-cycle $C_k$, then it must contain a chord. Indeed, if $G$ is not $C_k$, then there must be an edge $(v, w)$ for some vertex $v \in C_k$ such that $(v,w)$ is not an edge of $C_k$ (i.e.\ if $v = v_i$, then $w \notin \{v_{i-1}, v_{i+1} \}$). If $w \in C_k$, then the edge $(v,w)$ is a chord by definition, so suppose that $w \notin C_k$. Since $G$ is two-connected, removing $v$ does not disconnect the graph, so there must be a path from $w$ to one of the neighbours $v'$ of $v$ on the cycle $C_k$ which does not use the edge $(v,v')$. Taking this path from $w$ to the first point at which it intersects the cycle $C_k$ gives the desired chord.

We now show the lemma. From Lemma~\ref{lem:minrec_dec_cycle}, if $G$ is the $k$-cycle, then we have $\minrec[G] = k-1$. Therefore if $G$ is a $k$-cycle, then $\minrec[G] = 5$ if and only if $k=6$. It remains to show that if $G$ contains a chord, we cannot have $\minrec[G] = 5$. 

We proceed case-by-case based on the value of $k$. In each case, the number $\minrec[G]$ can be checked e.g.\ through the results of Section~\ref{subsec:minrec_prelims} or through using the \texttt{sandpile} module in SageMath~\cite{SageMath}. Since $G$ contains a chord, we must have $k \geq 4$ (otherwise $C_k$ would not be the longest cycle). The ``base cases'' are as follows, with the graphs illustrated on Figure~\ref{fig:5minrec_basecases} below.
\begin{enumerate}
\item\label{case:k=4_chord11} If $G$ is $C_4$ with one chord of length $1$ (Figure~\ref{fig:k=4_chord11}), then $\minrec[G] = 4$.
\item\label{case:k=4_chord12} If $G$ is $C_4$ with one chord of length $2$ (Figure~\ref{fig:k=4_chord12}), then $\minrec[G] = 7$.
\item\label{case:k=4_chord21} If $G$ is $C_4$ with two chords of length $1$ (Figure~\ref{fig:k=4_chord21}, this is the complete graph $K_4$), then $\minrec[G] = 6$.
\item\label{case:k=5_chord11} If $G$ is $C_5$ with one chord of length $1$ (Figure~\ref{fig:k=5_chord11}), then $\minrec[G] = 6$.
\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}

Aside from Case~\eqref{case:k=4_chord11}, all other possible graphs (i.e.\ two-connected graphs that are not cycles) can be obtained from at least one of Cases~\eqref{case:k=4_chord12}, \eqref{case:k=4_chord21} or \eqref{case:k=5_chord11} through a succession of edge addition or duplication operations, in the sense of Lemmas~\ref{lem:add_edge_minrec} and \ref{lem:dupl_edge_minrec}. Since these operations only increase the number of minimal recurrent configurations, which was at least $6$ in all three cases, this shows that such graphs cannot have exactly $5$ minimal recurrent configurations, and the lemma is proved.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:b(n,5)=0}]
Now suppose that $G$ is such that $\minrec[G] = 5$. Let $G' := \Prune[G]$ be the pruned graph of $G$ as in Section~\ref{subsec:minrec_prelims}. We claim that $G'$ is two-connected in this case. Seeking contradiction, suppose that $G'$ has a cut-vertex $v$ (i.e.\ removing $v$ disconnects the graph), and let $G'_1$ and $G'_2$ be the two components of $G'$ joined at $v$. By~\cite[Theorem~3.2]{DS}, we have $\minrec[G'] = \minrec[G'_1] \cdot \minrec[G'_2]$. But since $\minrec[G'] = \minrec[G] = 5$ is prime, this implies that one of $\minrec[G'_1]$ and $\minrec[G'_2]$ must be equal to $1$. Lemma~\ref{lem:minrec_tree} then implies that $G_1'$ or $G_2'$ must be a tree, which contradicts the fact that $G'$ is a pruned graph.

Applying Lemma~\ref{lem:5minrec} then gives that $G'$ must be isomorphic to the $6$-cycle. In particular, the original graph $G$ induces a $6$-cycle (the pruned graph of $G$ is always an induced subgraph of $G$). But from Point~(3) of Proposition~\ref{pro:perm_patterns_cycles} this is impossible if $G$ were a permutation graph. As such, we have shown that a graph $G$ satisfying $\minrec[G] = 5$ cannot be a permutation graph, which implies that there are no permutations with $5$ CNATs by Theorem~\ref{thm:cnat_minrec}, as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}\label{pb:proof_b(n,5)}
Our proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:b(n,5)=0} relies heavily on the structure of permutation graphs, and the fact that $\cnat[\pi] = \minrec[G_{\pi}]$ (Theorem~\ref{thm:cnat_minrec}), which is non-trivial. It would be interesting to find a more direct combinatorial proof of this result.
\end{problem}

\subsection{Permutations with maximal numbers of CNATs}\label{subsec:max_b(n,k)}

Our final result in this section looks at the maximum value of $k$ such that $b(n,k) > 0$. We answer in the affirmative Conjecture~6.3 in~\cite{CO}.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:max_b(n,k)}
For any $n \geq 1$, we have $\max\{ \cnat[\pi]; \pi \in S_n \} = (n-1)!$, and this maximum is achieved only for the decreasing permutation $\dec[n] = n(n-1)\cdots 1$. In other words, we have $B(n (n-1)!) = \{ \dec[n] \}$ and $B(n, k) = \emptyset$ for all $k > (n-1)!$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
That $\cnat[{\dec[n]}] = (n-1)!$ is a consequence of Theorem~\ref{thm:bij_cnat_perm}. We therefore need to show that if $\pi \neq \dec[n]$, we have $\cnat[\pi] < \cnat[{\dec[n]}]$. We may assume $n \geq 3$ here since for $n \leq 2$ the only irreducible permutation is the decreasing one.

For this, note that the permutation graph $G_{\dec[n]}$ associated with the decreasing permutation is the complete graph $K_n$ on $n$ vertices, and that $\dec[n]$ is the only permutation whose graph is the complete graph. We claim that if $G$ is a graph on $n$ vertices which is not complete, then $\minrec[G] < \minrec[K_n]$. Combining this with the above observation and Theorem~\ref{thm:cnat_minrec} then gives the desired result. Suppose therefore that $G$ is a graph with vertex set $[n]$ that is not complete. Then by definition there is a pair of vertices $i,j \in [n]$ such that the edge $(i,j)$ is not in $G$. We then have $\minrec[G] < \minrec[G \cup \{(i,j)\}]$ by Lemma~\ref{lem:add_edge_minrec}. In other words, if $G$ is not complete, we can add an edge to it and strictly increase its number of minimal recurrent configurations. We can then repeat this process until no more edges can be added, i.e.\ we reach the complete graph, which shows that $\minrec[G] < \minrec[K_n]$ as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}\label{rem:b(n,k!)}
Theorem~\ref{thm:max_b(n,k)} implies that $b(n,(n-1)!) = 1$. We have also shown (Corollary~\ref{cor:b(n,2)}) that $b(n,2) = b(n,2!) = (n-2) \cdot 2^{n-3}$, and from~\cite[Corollary~3.12]{CO} we know that $b(n,1) = b(n, 1!) = 2^{n-2}$. Finally, it was also conjectured in~\cite{CO} that $b(n, 6) = b(n, 3!) = \frac{(n-2)(n-3)}{2} \cdot 2^{n-4}$. This suggests that in general, we might have $b(n, k!) = \binom{n-2}{k-1} \cdot 2^{n-1-k} $ for all $n \geq 2$ and $1 \leq k < n$ (Sequence~A038207 in~\cite{OEIS}). However, this formula in fact breaks down almost immediately after these initial values, since our simulations showed that $b(6, 24) = 31$, which is actually a long way off the value of $\binom{4}{3} \cdot 2^1 = 8$ given by the above sequence. In fact, the sequence $\big( b(n, 24) \big)_{n \geq 5}$ does not appear at all in the OEIS, even given just its first three terms $1, 31, 176$. Table~\ref{table:b(n,k!)} below gives the first few rows of the triangular sequence $\big( b(n, k!) \big)_{n \geq 2,\, 1 \leq k < n}$.

\section{Conclusion and future perspectives}\label{sec:conc}
In this paper, we deepened the combinatorial studies of CNATs initiated in the literature (see e.g.\ ~\cite{ABBS, CO}) by connecting CNATs with a given permutation to minimal recurrent configurations of the ASM on the corresponding permutation graph (Theorem~\ref{thm:cnat_minrec}). In Theorem~\ref{thm:bij_cnat_perm}, we provided a new bijection between permutations and so-called upper-diagonal CNATs (CNATs whose associated permutation is the decreasing permutation $n(n-1)\cdots1$), which has the added benefit of preserving certain statistics of these objects. This bijection is defined recursively, based on two operations on labelled CNATs called top-row decomposition and top-row deletion.

We then investigated the enumeration of permutations with a given number of CNATs, answering a number of conjectures from~\cite{CO}. We gave separate characterisations of permutations with exactly $1$, $2$ or $3$ CNATs in terms of so-called \emph{quadrants} of the permutation's graphical representation, and in terms of permutation patterns. This allowed us to establish bijections between marked permutations with a single CNAT and permutations with $2$ CNATs (Theorem~\ref{thm:Insert_B(n,1)toB(n+1,2)}), and between permutations with $2$ CNATs and permutations with $3$ CNATs (Theorem~\ref{thm:biject_B(n,2)toB(n+1,3)}). From this we obtained enumerative formulas for permutations with $2$ or $3$ CNATs (Corollaries~\ref{cor:b(n,2)} and \ref{cor:b(n,3)}). Finally, we showed that there are no permutations of any length with exactly $5$ CNATs (Theorem~\ref{thm:b(n,5)=0}), and that the maximal number of CNATs associated with a given permutation of length $n$ is $(n-1)!$, achieved uniquely for the decreasing permutation $n(n-1)\cdots1$.

We end this paper with some possible directions for future research.
\begin{itemize}
\item Find a more ``direct'' combinatorial proof of the fact that there are no permutations with exactly $5$ CNATs, as explained in Problem~\ref{pb:proof_b(n,5)}.
\item Investigate the enumerative sequences $\big( b(n,k) \big)_{n \geq 1}$ for more values of $k$. In this paper, we have looked at the cases $k=1, 2, 3, 5, (n-1)!$. The paper~\cite{CO} suggests that the entries for $k=4, 6, 7$ do indeed appear in the OEIS~\cite{OEIS}. As explained in Remark~\ref{rem:b(n,k!)}, this is not the case for general factorial values of $k$, so it may be that these specific values essentially rely on there being relatively few permutation graphs with the specified number of minimal recurrent configurations. For instance, it seems plausible that the only graphs with $4$ minimal recurrent configurations are the two graphs made up of two triangles in Figures~\ref{fig:butterfly} and \ref{fig:k=4_chord11} with some trees attached. It also would be interesting to know if there are values of $k$ other than $5$ for which $b(n,k)$ is always $0$.
\item One observation form~\cite[Table~1]{CO} which lists the first few values of $\big( b(n,k) \big)$ is that there are very few values for which $b(n,k)$ is odd, other than the $1$'s at the right-hand end of each row implies by Theorem~\ref{thm:max_b(n,k)}. This is also true in our Table~\ref{table:b(n,k!)} above: $b(6, 24) = 31$ is the only other odd value here. Can this observation be quantified in some way?
\item A final direction of future research could be to restrict ourselves to certain subsets of permutations, for example \emph{derangements} (permutations with no fixed point). Fixed points seem to play an important role in the enumeration of permutations according to their number of associated CNATs, since a fixed point implies the existence of a $321$ pattern, which in turn means a $3$-cycle in the permutation graph (and cycles play an important role in the ASM). For instance, we know that there are no derangements with $2$ CNATs (Proposition~\ref{pro:B(n,2)_characterisation}), while permutations with $1$ and $3$ CNATs are all derangements (Propositions~\ref{pro:B(n,1)_quadrants} and \ref{pro:characterisation_B(n,3)_quadrants}). It is intriguring to consider other values of $k$ and check whether there are derangements or not which have $k$ CNATs. Besides derangements, we could also restrict ourselves to permutations containing or avoiding certain patterns.

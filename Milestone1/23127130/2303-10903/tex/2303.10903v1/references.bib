  abstract	= {One typical application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
		  is the intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance
		  mission, where the objective is to improve situation
		  awareness through information acquisition. For example, an
		  efficient way to gather information regarding a target is
		  to deploy UAV in such a way that it orbits around this
		  target at a desired distance. Such a UAV motion is called
		  circumnavigation. The objective of this paper is to design
		  a control algorithm such that this circumnavigation mission
		  is achieved under a GPS-denied environment when only range
		  measurement is used. The control algorithm is constructed
		  in two steps. The first step is to design a control
		  algorithm by assuming the availability of both range and
		  range rate measurements, where the associated control input
		  is always bounded. The second step is to further eliminate
		  the use of range rate measurement by using an estimated
		  range rate, obtained via a sliding-mode estimator based on
		  range measurement, to replace actual range rate
		  measurement. Such a controller design technique is
		  applicable in other UAV navigation and control missions
		  when a GPS-denied environment is considered.},

        \textbf{Qualitative comparison of models trained with different types of supervision on COCO 10\% setting}. 
        The result of the semi-supervised setting can detect instance masks for all objects but is vulnerable to misclassification (e.g. cat, person, bear, airplane, toilet). Meanwhile, our point-guided model presents accurate class predictions. Our MaskRefineNet further elaborates the mask representation.

        \textbf{Qualitative analysis of the effect of input sources of MaskRefineNet}. Object instances can not be distinguished when the point label is not given for MaskRefineNet (3rd col). Meanwhile, mask representations are inaccurate due to the absence of prior rough masks (4th col). Based on these low-cost priors, we can obtain sophisticated masks per object instance (5th col).

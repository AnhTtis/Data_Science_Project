        \textbf{Proposals and instance masks}. The absence of a proposal leads to the missing mask, even though the mask could be generated if given the correct proposal (zebra). Also, noise proposal often leads to noisy masks. Our motivation stems from the bottleneck in the proposal branch, and this paper shows economic point labels can be leveraged to resolve it.

Predicting patients' hospital length of stay (LOS) is essential for improving resource allocation and supporting decision-making in healthcare organizations. This paper proposes a novel approach for predicting LOS by modeling patient information as sequences of events. Specifically, we present a transformer-based model, termed Medic-BERT (M-BERT), for LOS prediction using the unique features describing patients' medical event sequences.  %se a BERT-like machine-
%Predicting patients' hospital length of stay (LOS) is essential for improving resource allocation and supporting decision making in healthcare organizations. This paper proposes a novel approach for predicting LOS based on by modeling patient information as sequences of events. We further present an adaptation of the transformer machine learning approach termed Medic-BERT (M-BERT) for sequence prediction to the unique features of patient medical event sequences.  %se a BERT-like machine-learning approach for predicting hospital LOS based on patient hospitalization sequences consisting of patient characteristics and in-hospital medical events. 
We performed empirical experiments on a cohort of more than $45k$ emergency care patients from a large Danish hospital. Experimental results show that M-BERT can achieve high accuracy on a variety of LOS problems and outperforms traditional non-sequence-based machine learning approaches.

    \caption{\textbf{RGN of three DP models on Pascal.} The depth is normalized by the total number of layers. Interestingly, RGN values differ a lot by models (legend shows RGN averaged over layers). ResNet50 has a large RGN in all layers, while EfficientNet has a very small RGN in all layers, which seems to support the generalization in OOD.}

\section{Conclusion}
We study ways of achieving a robust object detector by fine-tuning from a robust pre-trained model. 
We explore  warmup fine-tuning in object detection, i.e., decoder-probing followed by full fine-tuning, and find that it gives architecture-specific improvements. Given this, we explore two complementary techniques to preserve  generalizable representations:  weight regularization to preserve backbone features, and the design of the decoder. These techniques prove useful for diverse architectures and datasets. We believe they will be good baselines for generalizable object detection. %To encourage more  studies, we will publish our code upon acceptance.

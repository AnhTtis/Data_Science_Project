\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}

We propose LearnedFTL, a learning-based page-level FTL design, by exploiting some unique characteristics of both the flash device and the learned index. LearnedFTL uses an in-place-update linear model to build learned indexes efficiently, a virtual PPN representation to obtain contiguous PPNs for sorted LPNs, and a group-based allocation and model training via GC/rewrite strategy to reduce the training overhead. Our FEMU-based prototype and extensive evaluations have validated that LearnedFTL outperforms the state-of-the-art TPFTL and LeaFTL schemes.

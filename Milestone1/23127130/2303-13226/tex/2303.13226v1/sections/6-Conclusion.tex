Applying the learned index technique to the page-level FTL designs of flash-based SSDs is non-trivial and faces the three main challenges of model selection, disordering of PPNs, and model correctness assessment. To address these challenges, we propose LearnedFTL, a learning-based page-level FTL design, by exploiting some unique characteristics of both the flash device and the learned index. LearnedFTL exploits the page relocation characteristics of GC and builds learned models to translate LPNs to their PPNs. Our FEMU-based prototype and trace-driven evaluations show that LearnedFTL reduces the P99 latency of the state-of-the-art TPFTL scheme by an average of 4.8$\times$, and performs very close to the ideal FTL in both average latency and tail latency under heavy loads. Moreover, LearnedFTL also provides much better performance under other benchmark evaluations. 

%LearnedFTL is only an initial step toward integrating learned index in flash-based SSDs. More detailed studies, such as different model choices~\cite{Flood} and more sophisticated tuning for skew workloads~\cite{Tsunami}, could be promising topics for future work.

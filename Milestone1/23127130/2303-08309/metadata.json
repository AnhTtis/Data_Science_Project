    "abstract": "Greybody factors are computed for massless fields of spin 0, 1/2, 1, and 2 emitted from higher-dimensional non-commutative geometry inspired black holes. Short-range potentials are used with path-ordered matrix exponentials to numerically calculate transmission coefficients. The resulting absorption cross sections and emission spectra are computed on the brane and compared with the higher-dimensional Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole. A non-commutative black hole at its maximum temperature in seven extra dimensions will radiate a particle flux and power of 0.72-0.81 and 0.75-0.81, respectively, times lower than a Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole of the same temperature. A non-commutative black hole at its maximum temperature in seven extra dimensions will radiate a particle flux and power of 0.64-0.72 and 0.60-0.64, respectively, times lower than a Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole of the same mass.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning can be a powerful tool to discover new signal types in astronomical data. We here apply it to search for long-duration transient gravitational waves triggered by pulsar glitches, which could yield physical insight into the mostly unknown depths of the pulsar. Current methods to search for such signals rely on matched filtering and a brute-force grid search over possible signal durations, which is sensitive but can become very computationally expensive. We develop a method to search for post-glitch signals on combining matched filtering with convolutional neural networks, which reaches similar sensitivities to the standard method at false-alarm probabilities relevant for practical searches, while being significantly faster. We specialize to the Vela glitch during the LIGO-Virgo O2 run, and set upper limits on the gravitational-wave strain amplitude from the data of the two LIGO detectors for both constant-amplitude and exponentially decaying signals.",

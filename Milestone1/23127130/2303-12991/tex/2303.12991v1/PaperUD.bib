	abstract = {The astorb database at Lowell Observatory is an actively curated catalog of all known asteroids in the Solar System. astorb has heritage dating back to the 1970s and has been publicly accessible since the 1990s. Work began in 2015 to modernize the underlying database infrastructure, operational software, and associated web applications. That effort involved the expansion of astorb to incorporate new data such as physical properties (e.g. albedo, colors, spectral types) from a variety of sources. The data in astorb are used to support a number of research tools hosted at https://asteroid.lowell.edu. Here we present a full description of the software tools, computational foundation, and data products upon which the astorb ecosystem has been built.},

	abstract = {The heart of the 6.5 Magellan AO system (MagAO) is a 585 actuator adaptive secondary mirror (ASM) with {\textless}1 msec response times (0.7 ms typically). This adaptive secondary will allow low emissivity and high-contrast AO science. We fabricated a high order (561 mode) pyramid wavefront sensor (similar to that now successfully used at the Large Binocular Telescope). The relatively high actuator count (and small projected {\textasciitilde}23 cm pitch) allows moderate Strehls to be obtained by MagAO in the “visible” (0.63-1.05 μm). To take advantage of this we have fabricated an AO CCD science camera called "VisAO". Complete “end-to-end” closed-loop lab tests of MagAO achieve a solid, broad-band, 37\% Strehl (122 nm rms) at 0.76 μm (i’) with the VisAO camera in 0.8” simulated seeing (13 cm ro at V) with fast 33 mph winds and a 40 m Lo locked on R=8 mag artificial star. These relatively high visible wavelength Strehls are enabled by our powerful combination of a next generation ASM and a Pyramid WFS with 400 controlled modes and 1000 Hz sample speeds (similar to that used successfully on-sky at the LBT). Currently only the VisAO science camera is used for lab testing of MagAO, but this high level of measured performance (122 nm rms) promises even higher Strehls with our IR science cameras. On bright (R=8 mag) stars we should achieve very high Strehls ({\textgreater}70\% at H) in the IR with the existing MagAO Clio2 (λ=1-5.3 μm) science camera/coronagraph or even higher ({\textasciitilde}98\% Strehl) the Mid-IR (8-26 microns) with the existing BLINC/MIRAC4 science camera in the future. To eliminate non-common path vibrations, dispersions, and optical errors the VisAO science camera is fed by a common path advanced triplet ADC and is piggy-backed on the Pyramid WFS optical board itself. Also a high-speed shutter can be used to block periods of poor correction. The entire system passed CDR in June 2009, and we finished the closed-loop system level testing phase in December 2011. Final system acceptance (“pre-ship” review) was passed in February 2012. In May 2012 the entire AO system is was successfully shipped to Chile and fully tested/aligned. It is now in storage in the Magellan telescope clean room in anticipation of “First Light” scheduled for December 2012. An overview of the design, attributes, performance, and schedule for the Magellan AO system and its two science cameras are briefly presented here.},

	abstract = {We have obtained Hubble Space Telescope STIS and NICMOS and Gemini/GPI scattered-light images of the HD 191089 debris disk. We identify two spatial components: a ring resembling the Kuiper Belt in radial extent (FWHM ∼ 25 au, centered at ∼46 au) and a halo extending to ∼640 au. We find that the halo is significantly bluer than the ring, consistent with the scenario that the ring serves as the “birth ring” for the smaller dust in the halo. We measure the scattering phase functions in the 30°-150° scattering-angle range and find that the halo dust is more forward- and backward-scattering than the ring dust. We measure a surface density power-law index of -0.68 ± 0.04 for the halo, which indicates the slowdown of the radial outward motion of the dust. Using radiative transfer modeling, we attempt to simultaneously reproduce the (visible) total and (near-infrared) polarized intensity images of the birth ring. Our modeling leads to mutually inconsistent results, indicating that more complex models, such as the inclusion of more realistic aggregate particles, are needed.},

From their X-ray flux, lithium absorption, and location on pre-main-sequence evolutionary tracks, the companions appear to be 5 Myr old. HD 141569A is now one of the few main-sequence stars with a circumstellar disk that has a well-determined age.

	abstract = {We present the first spatially resolved scattered-light images of four debris disks around members of the Scorpius-Centaurus (Sco-Cen) OB association with high-contrast imaging and polarimetry using the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI). All four disks are resolved for the first time in polarized light, and one disk is also detected in total intensity. The three disks imaged around HD 111161, HD 143675, and HD 145560 are symmetric in both morphology and brightness distribution. The three systems span a range of inclinations and radial extents. The disk imaged around HD 98363 shows indications of asymmetries in morphology and brightness distribution, with some structural similarities to the HD 106906 planet-disk system. Uniquely, HD 98363 has a wide comoving stellar companion, Wray 15-788, with a recently resolved disk with very different morphological properties. HD 98363 A/B is the first binary debris disk system with two spatially resolved disks. All four targets have been observed with ALMA, and their continuum fluxes range from one nondetection to one of the brightest disks in the region. With the new results, a total of 15 A/F stars in Sco-Cen have resolved scattered-light debris disks, and approximately half of these systems exhibit some form of asymmetry. Combining the GPI disk structure results with information from the literature on millimeter fluxes and imaged planets reveals a diversity of disk properties in this young population. Overall, the four newly resolved disks contribute to the census of disk structures measured around A/F stars at this important stage in the development of planetary systems.},

	abstract = {Observations have been obtained to verify the existence of diffuse interstellar radiation. A Fabry photometer, attached to the 40-inch refractor at the Yerkes Observatory, was used to measure the brightness of regions over a wide range of galactic latitude. The intensities in the photographic region of the spectrum were calibrated by means of the Polar Sequence stars. The mean of four such runs across the Milky Way, on circles of nearly constant longitude, 1 = 40°, shows a maximum of brightness of 8o stars of the tenth magnitude per square degree for the diffuse extra-terrestrial radiation. The mean of three runs near 1 = 1400 shows a maximum of 35 in the same units. It is shown that the observed intensity of diffuse light may be explained as scal{\textasciitilde}tered stellar radiation if the phase function governing the scattering of starlight by the interstellar matter is strongly forward- throwing. The concentration of the diffuse light toward the galactic circle is also in agreement with this property of the phase function. The observations also indicate that the scattering efficiency, or albedo, of the particles is greater than 0.3},

	abstract = {Context. The formation and evolution of planetary systems impact the evolution of the primordial accretion disk in its dust and gas content. HD 141569 is a peculiar object in this context as it is the only known pre-main sequence star characterized by a hybrid disk. Observations with 8 m class telescopes probed the outer-disk structure showing a complex system of multiple rings and outer spirals. Furthermore, interferometric observations attempted to characterize its inner 5 au region, but derived limited constraints. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: The goal of this work was to explore with new high-resolution interferometric observations the geometry, properties, and dynamics of the dust and gas in the internal regions of HD 141569. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We observed HD 141569 on milliarcsecond scales with GRAVITY/VLTI in the near-infrared (IR) at low (R {\textasciitilde} 20) and high (R {\textasciitilde} 4000) spectral resolution. We interpreted the interferometric visibilities and spectral energy distribution with geometrical models and through radiative transfer techniques using the code MCMax to constrain the dust emission. We analyzed the high spectral resolution quantities (visibilities and differential phases) to investigate the properties of the Brackett-γ (Brγ) line emitting region. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: Thanks to the combination of three different epochs, GRAVITY resolves the inner dusty disk in the K band with squared visibilities down to V{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} {\textasciitilde} 0.8. A differential phase signal is also detected in the region of the Brγ line along most of the six baselines. Data modeling shows that an IR excess of about 6\% is spatially resolved and that the origin of this emission is confined in a ring of material located at a radius of {\textasciitilde}1 au from the star with a width ≲0.3 au. The MCMax modeling suggests that this emission could originate from a small amount (1.4 × 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}−8{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊕{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) of quantum-heated particles, while large silicate grain models cannot reproduce at the same time the observational constraints on the properties of near-IR and mid-IR fluxes. The high spectral resolution differential phases in the Brγ line clearly show an S-shape that can be best reproduced with a gaseous disk in Keplerian rotation, confined within 0.09 au (or 12.9 R{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⋆{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}). This is also hinted at by the double-peaked Brγ emission line shape, known from previous observations and confirmed by GRAVITY. The modeling of the continuum and gas emission shows that the inclination and position angle of these two components are consistent with a system showing relatively coplanar rings on all scales. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: With a new and unique observational dataset on HD 141569, we show that the complex disk of this source is composed of a multitude of rings on all scales. This aspect makes HD 141569 a potentially unique source to investigate planet formation and disk evolution in intermediate-mass pre-main sequence stars.},

	abstract = {Most current high contrast imaging point spread function (PSF) subtraction algorithms use some form of a least-squares noise minimization to find exoplanets that are, before post-processing, often hidden below the instrumental speckle noise. In the current standard PSF subtraction algorithms, a set of reference images is derived from the target image sequence to subtract each target image, using Angular and/or Simultaneous Spectral Differential Imaging (ADI, SSDI, respectively). However, to avoid excessive exoplanet self-subtraction, ADI and SSDI (in the absence of a strong spectral feature) severely limit the available number of reference images at small separations. This limits the performance of the least-squares algorithm, resulting in lower sensitivity to exoplanets at small angular separations. Possible solutions are to use additional reference images by acquiring longer sequences, use SSDI if the exoplanet is expected to show strong spectral features, or use images acquired on other targets. The latter option, known as Reference Star Differential Imaging (RSDI), which relies on the use of reference images that are highly correlated to the target image, has been ineffective in previous ground-based high contrast imaging surveys. The now {\textgreater}200 target reference library from the Gemini Planet Imager Exoplanet Survey (GPIES) allows for a detailed RSDI analysis to possibly improve contrast performance near the focal plane mask, at 2-7λ/D separations. We present the results of work to optimize PSF subtraction with the GPIES reference library using a least-squares algorithm designed to minimize speckle noise and maximize planet throughput, thus maximizing the planet signal to noise ratio (SNR). Using December 2014 51 Eri GPI data in the inner 100 mas to 300 mas annulus, we find no apparent improvement in SNR when using RSDI and/or our optimization scheme. This result, while still being investigated, seems to show that current algorithms on ADI+SSDI data sets are optimized, and that limited gains can be achieved by using a PSF archive.},

	abstract = {The disk around HD 141569 is one of a handful of systems whose weak infrared emission is consistent with a debris disk, but still has a significant reservoir of gas. Here we report spatially resolved millimeter observations of the CO(3-2) and CO(1-0) emission as seen with the Submillimeter Array and CARMA. We find that the excitation temperature for CO is lower than expected from cospatial blackbody grains, similar to previous observations of analogous systems, and derive a gas mass that lies between that of gas-rich primordial disks and gas-poor debris disks. The data also indicate a large inner hole in the CO gas distribution and an outer radius that lies interior to the outer scattered light rings. This spatial distribution, with the dust rings just outside the gaseous disk, is consistent with the expected interactions between gas and dust in an optically thin disk. This indicates that gas can have a significant effect on the location of the dust within debris disks.},

	abstract = {We have obtained Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) J-, H-, K1-, and K2-Spec observations of the iconic debris ring around the young, main-sequence star HR 4796A. We applied several point-spread function (PSF) subtraction techniques to the observations (Mask-and-Interpolate, RDI-NMF, RDI-KLIP, and ADI-KLIP) to measure the geometric parameters and the scattering phase function for the disk. To understand the systematic errors associated with PSF subtraction, we also forward-modeled the observations using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo framework and a simple model for the disk. We found that measurements of the disk geometric parameters were robust, with all of our analyses yielding consistent results; however, measurements of the scattering phase function were challenging to reconstruct from PSF-subtracted images, despite extensive testing. As a result, we estimated the scattering phase function using disk modeling. We searched for a dependence of the scattering phase function with respect to the GPI filters but found none. We compared the H-band scattering phase function with that measured by Hubble Space Telescope STIS at visual wavelengths and discovered a blue color at small scattering angles and a red color at large scattering angles, consistent with predictions and laboratory measurements of large grains. Finally, we successfully modeled the SPHERE H2 HR 4796A scattered phase function using a distribution of hollow spheres composed of silicates, carbon, and metallic iron.},

By applying reference differential imaging point-spread function subtraction, we detect the disk at high signal-to-noise ratios in all three bands. We find strong morphological differences between the bands, including asymmetries consistent with the observed spiral arms within 100 au in \$L{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime\} \$ . An apparent deficit of scattered light at 3.08 μm relative to the bracketing wavelengths (K {\textless}SUB{\textgreater} s {\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and \$L{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime\} \$ ) is evocative of ice absorption at the disk surface layer. However, the Δ(K {\textless}SUB{\textgreater} s {\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} - H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}O) color is consistent with grains with little to no ice (0\%-5\% by mass). The \$\{{\textbackslash}rm\{{\textbackslash}Delta \}\}(\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{H\}\}\}\_\{2\}\{{\textbackslash}rm\{O\}\}-\{L\}{\textasciicircum}\{\{{\textbackslash}prime\} \})\$ color, conversely, suggests grains with a much higher ice mass fraction ({\textasciitilde}0.68), and the two colors cannot be reconciled under a single grain population model. Additionally, we find that the extremely red \$\{{\textbackslash}rm\{{\textbackslash}Delta \}\}(\{K\}\_\{s\}-L{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime\} )\$ disk color cannot be reproduced under conventional scattered light modeling with any combination of grain parameters or reasonable local extinction values. We hypothesize that the scattering surfaces at the three wavelengths are not colocated, and that the optical depth effects in each wavelength result from probing the grain population at different disk surface depths. The morphological similarity between K {\textless}SUB{\textgreater} s {\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}O suggests that their scattering surfaces are near one another, lending credence to the Δ(K {\textless}SUB{\textgreater} s {\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} - H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}O) disk color constraint of {\textless}5\% ice mass fraction for the outermost scattering disk layer.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses the impact of introducing a planet on an eccentric orbit into a dynamically cold planetesimal disk. That planet’s secular perturbations cause the orbits of the planetesimals to evolve in such a way that at any one time planetesimals at the same distance from the star have common pericentres and eccentricities. This causes the surface density distribution of an extended planetesimal disk to exhibit two spirals, one exterior the other interior to the planet’s orbit. These two spirals unwind in diﬀerent directions and their structure is described by just two parameters: the time since the planet was introduced relative to the characteristic secular timescale, tsec(3:2) = 0.651 a3pl/M (M /Mpl); and the planet’s eccentricity, epl. At late times the spirals become tightly wound and the oﬀset centre of symmetry of the pericentre glow approximation is recovered. Comparison with spiral structure seen in the HD 141569 disk shows that its spiral at 325 AU is similar to the structure that would be caused by introducing a planet into the disk 5 Myr ago with a mass in the range 0.2−2 MJup orbiting at 235–250 AU with an eccentricity of 0.05–0.2; likewise a Saturn mass planet at 150 AU would cause structure like that seen at 200 AU. More deﬁnitive statements about any planets orbiting HD 141569 from this model could be made once the eﬀect of the binary companion on the disk is known (e.g., from knowledge of its orbit), and once the disk’s structure has been better characterised down to 100 AU, including the location of the star within the disk. The relatively young age of this system (∼5 Myr) means that if giant planets really do exist at hundreds of AU from HD 141569, this provides a unique opportunity to set constraints on the mechanism by which those planets came to be at such large distances, especially since the structure of the disk out of which those planets would have formed can be imaged.},

At an age of about 5 Myr, the disk has a complex morphology that may be best interpreted as a nascent debris system with gas. Our 870 μm ALMA continuum observations resolve a dust disk out to approximately 56 au from the star (assuming a distance of 116 pc) with 0 38 resolution and 0.07 mJy beam−1 sensitivity. We measure a continuum ﬂux density for this inner material of 3.8±0.4 mJy (including calibration uncertainties). The 12CO(3-2) gas is resolved kinematically and spatially from about 30 to 210 au. The integrated 12CO(3-2) line ﬂux density is 15.7±1.6 Jy km s−1. We estimate the mass of the millimeter debris and 12CO(3-2) gas to be 0.04M⊕ and ∼2×10−3M⊕, respectively. If the millimeter grains are part of a collisional cascade, then we infer that the inner disk ({\textless}50 au) has ∼160M⊕ contained within objects less than 50 km in radius, depending on the planetesimal size distribution and density assumptions. Markov Chain Monte Carlo modeling of the system reveals a disk morphology with an inclination of 53°. 4 centered around an M=2.39Me host star (Msin(i)=1.92Me).

	abstract = {Methods. For all known Herbig Ae/Be stars with parallaxes in Gaia DR2, we collected their atmospheric parameters and photometric and extinction values from the literature. To these data we added near-infrared and mid-infrared photometry, and collected Hα emission line properties such as equivalent widths and line proﬁles, and their binarity status. In addition, we developed a photometric variability indicator from Gaia’s DR2 information.
Results. We provide masses, ages, luminosities, distances, photometric variabilities and IR excesses homogeneously derived for the most complete sample of Herbig Ae/Be stars to date. We ﬁnd that high-mass stars have a much smaller IR excess and have much lower optical variabilities compared to lower-mass stars, with the break at around 7 M . Hα emission is generally correlated with IR excess, with the correlation being stronger for IR emission at wavelengths tracing the hot dust closest to the star. The variability indicator as developed by us shows that ∼25\% of all Herbig Ae/Be stars are strongly variable. We observe that the strongly variable objects display doubly peaked Hα line proﬁles, indicating an edge-on disk.
Conclusions. The fraction of strongly variable Herbig Ae stars is close to that found for A-type UX Ori stars. It had been suggested that this variability is in most cases due to asymmetric dusty disk structures seen edge-on. The observation here is in strong support of this hypothesis. Finally, the diﬀerence in dust properties occurs at 7 M , while various properties traced at UV/optical wavelengths diﬀer at a lower mass, 3 M . The latter has been linked to diﬀerent accretion mechanisms at work, whereas the diﬀering IR properties and photometric variabilities are related to diﬀerent or diﬀerently acting (dust-)disk-dispersal mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Methods. We observed the ﬁne-structure lines of O i at 63 and 145 μm and the C ii line at 157 μm with the PACS instrument onboard the Herschel Space Telescope as part of the open-time large program GASPS. We complemented the atomic line observations with archival Spitzer spectroscopic and photometric continuum data, a ground-based VLT-VISIR image at 8.6 μm, and 12CO fundamental ro-vibrational and pure rotational J = 3–2 observations. We simultaneously modeled the continuum emission and the line ﬂuxes with the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code MCFOST and the thermo-chemical code ProDiMo to derive the disk gas- and dust properties assuming no dust settling.
Results. The models suggest that the oxygen lines are emitted from the inner disk around HD 141569A, whereas the [C ii] line emission is more extended. The CO submillimeter ﬂux is emitted mostly by the outer disk. Simultaneous modeling of the photometric and line data using a realistic disk structure suggests a dust mass derived from grains with a radius smaller than 1 mm of ∼2.1 × 10−7 M and from grains with a radius of up to 1 cm of 4.9 × 10−6 M . We constrained the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) mass to be between 2 × 10−11 and 1.4 × 10−10 M assuming circumcircumcoronene (C150H30) as the representative PAH. The associated PAH abundance relative to hydrogen is lower than those found in the interstellar medium (3 × 10−7) by two to three orders of magnitude. The disk around HD 141569A is less massive in gas (2.5 to 4.9 × 10−4 M or 67 to 164 M⊕) and has a ﬂat opening angle ({\textless}10\%).
Conclusions. We constrained simultaneously the silicate dust grain, PAH, and gas mass in a ∼5-Myr old Herbig Ae disk. The diskaveraged gas-to-dust-mass is most likely around 100, which is the assumed value at the disk formation despite the uncertainties due to disagreements between the diﬀerent gas tracers. If the disk was originally massive, the gas and the dust would have dissipated at the same rate.},

For detection this approach provides comparable suppression to the Locally Optimized Combination of Images (LOCI) algorithm, albeit with increased robustness to the algorithm parameters and speed enhancement. For characterization of detected sources, the method enables forward modeling of astrophysical sources. This alleviates the biases in the astrometry and photometry of discovered faint sources, which are usually associated with LOCI-based PSF subtractions schemes.

Combining our new scattered light data with archival Hubble Space Telescope images at ∼0.5–2 μm, along with previously unpublished Spitzer/MIPS thermal emission data and all other literature thermal data, we set out to constrain the chemical composition of the dust grains. After testing 19 individual root compositions and more than 8400 unique mixtures of these compositions, we ﬁnd that good ﬁts to the scattered light alone and thermal emission alone are discrepant, suggesting that caution should be exercised if ﬁtting to only one or the other. When we ﬁt to both data sets simultaneously, we ﬁnd that silicates and organics are generally the most favored, while large abundances of water ice are usually not favored. These results suggest the HR 4796A dust grains are similar to interstellar dust and solar system comets, though improved modeling is necessary to place better constraints on the exact chemical composition of the dust.},

	abstract = {Methods. We implemented a density function varying azimuthally along the ring and generated synthetic images both in polarimetry and in total intensity, which are then compared to the actual data. The search for the best-ﬁt model was performed both with a gridbased and an MCMC approach. Using the outcome of this modelization, we further measured the polarized scattering phase function for the observed scattering angle between 33◦ and 147◦ as well as the spectral reﬂectance of the southern part of the ring between 0.98 and 2.1 µm. We tentatively derived the grain properties by comparing these quantities with MCFOST models and assuming Mie scattering.
Results. We ﬁnd that the dust density peaks in the south-west at an azimuthal angle of 220◦∼238◦ with a rather broad width of 61◦∼127◦. The difference in the intensity distributions observed in polarimetry and total intensity is the result of this particular morphology. Although there are still uncertainties that remain in the determination of the anisotropic scattering factor, the implementation of an azimuthal density variation to ﬁt the data proved to be robust. Upon elaborating on the origin of this dust density distribution, we conclude that it could be the result of a massive collision when we account for the effect of the high gas mass that is present in the system on the dynamics of grains. In terms of grain composition, our preliminary interpretation indicates a mixture of porous sub-micron sized astro-silicate and carbonaceous grains.
Conclusions. The SPHERE observations have allowed, for the ﬁrst time, for meaningful constraints to be placed on the dust distribution beyond the standard picture of a uniform ring-like debris disk. However, future studies with a multiwavelength approach and additional detailed modeling would be required to better characterize the grain properties in the HD 141569 system.},

	abstract = {When giant planets form, they grow by accreting gas and dust. HD 142527 is a young star that offers a scaled-up view of this process. It has a broad, asymmetric ring of gas and dust beyond ∼100 AU and a wide inner gap. Within the gap, a low-mass stellar companion orbits the primary star at just ∼12 AU, and both the primary and secondary are accreting gas. In an attempt to directly detect the dusty counterpart to this accreted gas, we have observed HD 142527 with the Gemini Planet Imager in polarized light at Y band (0.95–1.14 μm). We clearly detect the companion in total intensity and show that its position and photometry are generally consistent with the expected values. We also detect a point source in polarized light that may be spatially separated by ∼ a few AU from the location of the companion in total intensity. This suggests that dust is likely falling onto or orbiting the companion. Given the possible contribution of scattered light from this dust to previously reported photometry of the companion, the current mass limits should be viewed as upper limits only. If the dust near the companion is eventually conﬁrmed to be spatially separated, this system would resemble a scaled-up version of the young planetary system inside the gap of the transition disk around LkCa 15.},

	abstract = {We present an adaptive optics imaging detection of the HD 32297 debris disk at L (3.8 μm) obtained with the LBTI/LMIRcam infrared instrument at the Large Binocular Telescope. The disk is detected at signal-to-noise ratio per resolution element ∼3–7.5 from ∼0.3 to 1.1 (30–120 AU). The disk at L is bowed, as was seen at shorter wavelengths. This likely indicates that the disk is not perfectly edge-on and contains highly forward-scattering grains. Interior to ∼50 AU, the surface brightness at L rises sharply on both sides of the disk, which was also previously seen at Ks band. This evidence together points to the disk containing a second inner component located at 50 AU. Comparing the color of the outer (50 {\textless} r/AU {\textless}120) portion of the disk at L with archival Hubble Space Telescope/NICMOS images of the disk at 1–2 μm allows us to test the recently proposed cometary grains model of Donaldson et al. We ﬁnd that the model fails to match this disk’s surface brightness and spectrum simultaneously (reduced chi-square = 17.9). When we modify the density distribution of the model disk, we obtain a better overall ﬁt (reduced chi-square = 2.87). The best ﬁt to all of the data is a pure water ice model (reduced chi-square = 1.06), but additional resolved imaging at 3.1 μm is necessary to constrain how much (if any) water ice exists in the disk, which can then help reﬁne the originally proposed cometary grains model.},

At the Ks band, the disk is detected at signal-to-noise per resolution element (SNRE) ∼ 3–8 from ∼1 to 2.5 (45–113 AU) on the western side and from ∼1.2 to 2.1 (63–90 AU) on the east. At L the disk is detected at SNRE ∼ 2.5 from ∼1 to 1.45 (45–90 AU) on both sides, implying more symmetric disk structure at 3.8 μm. At both wavelengths the disk has a bow-like shape and is offset from the star to the north by a few AU. A surface brightness asymmetry exists between the two sides of the disk at the Ks band, but not at L . The surface brightness at the Ks band declines inside 1 (∼45 AU), which may be indicative of a gap in the disk near 1 . The Ks − L disk color, after removal of the stellar color, is mostly gray for both sides of the disk. This suggests that scattered light is coming from large dust grains, with 3–10 μm sized grains on the east side and 1–10 μm dust grains on the west. This may suggest that the west side is composed of smaller dust grains than the east side, which would support the interpretation that the disk is being dynamically affected by interactions with the local interstellar medium.},

We ﬁrst use analytical calculations to reduce the parameter space of the 2 stellar companion orbit and then perform N-body numerical simulations of the ﬂyby encounter using symplectic integration, taking into account the gravitational inﬂuence of the stars and the planets on massless test particles.
Results. The binary orbit is found to be almost ﬁxed by the observational constraint on an edge-on plane with respect to the observers. If the binary had an inﬂuence on the disk structure, it should have a passing time at the periapsis between 5000 and 8000 years ago and a distance at periapsis between 600 and 900 AU. It also appears that the best scenario to reproduce the disk morphology is a ﬂyby with 1 planet embedded in the disk. For a 2 MJ planet, its orbital eccentricity must be around 0.2 while for a 8 MJ planet, it must be below 0.1. In the two cases, its apoapsis is about 130 AU.
Conclusions. Although the global disk shape is reasonably well reproduced, some observed features cannot be explained by the present model and the likehood of the ﬂyby event remains an issue for the scenario explored in this paper. Dynamically speaking, HD 141569 is still a puzzling system.},

	abstract = {A new class of high-contrast image analysis algorithms that empirically ﬁt and subtract systematic noise has lead to recent discoveries of faint exoplanet/substellar companions and scattered light images of circumstellar disks. These methods are extremely efﬁcient at enhancing the detectability of a faint astrophysical signal, but they generally create systematic biases in their observed properties. This paper provides a general solution for this outstanding problem. We present an analytical derivation of a linear expansion that captures the impact of astrophysical over-subtraction or self-subtraction in current image analysis techniques. We examine the general case for which the reference images of the astrophysical scene move azimuthally and/or radially across the ﬁeld of view as a result of the observation strategy. Our new method is based on perturbing the covariance matrix underlying any least-squares speckles problem, and propagating this perturbation through the data analysis algorithm. Most of the work in this paper is presented in the Principal Component Analysis framework, but it can be easily generalized to methods relying on the linear combination of images (instead of eigenmodes). Based on this linear expansion, which is obtained in the most general case, we then demonstrate practical applications of this new algorithm. We ﬁrst consider the spectral extraction of faint point sources in IFS data and illustrate, using public Gemini Planet Imager commissioning data, that our novel perturbation-based Forward Modeling, which we named Karhunen Loeve Image Processing (KLIP-FM), can indeed alleviate algorithmic biases. We then apply KLIP-FM to the detection of point sources and show how it decreases the rate of false negatives while keeping the rate of false positives unchanged when compared to classical KLIP. This can potentially have important consequences on the design of follow-up strategies of ongoing direct imaging surveys.},

Results. We discovered several new structures inside 1 , of which the most prominent is a bright ring with sharp edges (semi-major axis: 0.4 ) featuring a strong north-south brightness asymmetry. Other faint structures are also detected from 0.4 to 1 in the form of concentric ringlets and at least one spiral arm. Finally, the VISIR data at 8.6 µm suggests the presence of an additional dust population closer in. Besides, we do not detect companions more massive than 1–3 mass of Jupiter.
Conclusions. The performance of SPHERE allows us to resolve the extended dust component, which was previously detected at thermal and visible wavelengths, into very complex patterns with strong asymmetries; the nature of these asymmetries remains to be understood. Scenarios involving shepherding by planets or dust-gas interactions will have to be tested against these observations.},

The data, with a spatial resolution and signal to noise higher than those previously obtained with HST/NICMOS2 allow a more detailed insight in the system. They reveal a very structured system, in which two ring-like structures at distances 200 and 325 AU from the star are the most prominent features. The region between 125 and 175 AU is clearly devoid of material. An arc-like structure is also detected at about 250 AU, as well as a diﬀuse extended emission, both on the North side of the disk. The system appears to be highly asymmetrical, both with respect to its major and minor axes. Surprisingly, the brightness asymmetry with respect to both axes in the inner and outer parts of the disk is reversed. Possible explanations to the asymmetries include anisotropic scattering and/or non axisymmetrical distribution of the dust within the system. It is shown that anisotropic scattering cannot alone be responsible for all observed asymmetries. It is concluded that HD 141569 disk is non axi-symmetrical. Eventhough no detailed modeling is given in this observational paper, it is probable that the sculpting and brightness properties of the disk are due to the gravitational perturbation of a massive body.},

The new GPI data complement recent Hubble Space Telescope/STIS observations that show the disk extending out to over 500 au. The GPI image displays a strong asymmetry along the projected minor axis as well as a fainter asymmetry along the projected major axis. We associate the minor and major axis asymmetries with polarized forward scattering and a possible stellocentric offset, respectively. To constrain the disk geometry, we ﬁt two separate disk models to the polarized image, each using a different scattering phase function. Both models favor a disk inclination of ∼70° and a 1.5±0.6 au stellar offset in the plane of the sky along the projected major axis of the disk. We ﬁnd that the stellar offset in the disk plane, perpendicular to the projected major axis is degenerate with the form of the scattering phase function and remains poorly constrained. The disk is not recovered in total intensity due in part to strong adaptive optics residuals, but we recover three point sources. Considering the system’s proximity to the galactic plane and the point sources’ positions relative to the disk, we consider it likely that they are background objects and unrelated to the disk’s offset from the star.},

A quintessential example is the massive extrasolar planet β Pic b, which is 9 AU from and embedded in the debris disk of the young nearby A6V star β Pictoris. We observed the system with ﬁrst light of the Magellan Adaptive Optics (MagAO) system. In Paper I we presented the ﬁrst CCD detection of this planet with MagAO+VisAO. Here we present four MagAO+Clio images of β Pic b at 3.1 μm, 3.3 μm, L′, and M¢, including the ﬁrst observation in the fundamental CH4 band. To remove systematic errors from the spectral energy distribution (SED), we re-calibrate the literature photometry and combine it with our own data, for a total of 22 independent measurements at 16 passbands from 0.99 to 4.8 μm. Atmosphere models demonstrate the planet is cloudy but are degenerate in effective temperature and radius. The measured SED now covers {\textgreater}80\% of the planet’s energy, so we approach the bolometric luminosity empirically. We calculate the luminosity by extending the measured SED with a blackbody and integrating to ﬁnd log(bol/) = -3.78  0.03. From our bolometric luminosity and an age of 23±3Myr, hot-start evolutionary tracks give a mass of 12.7±0.3Jup, radius of 1.45±0.02Jup, and Teff of 1708±23K (model-dependent errors not included). Our empirically determined luminosity is in agreement with values from atmospheric models (typically -3.8 dex), but brighter than values from the ﬁeld-dwarf bolometric correction (typically -3.9 dex), illustrating the limitations in comparing young exoplanets to old brown dwarfs.},

Both objects have been reported to show “anomalous positions” in the HR diagram in the sense that they appear below the main sequence. A signiﬁcant result of this work is that both stars are metal-deﬁcient. The Hipparcos distance of HD 34282 is very uncertain and the current study places the star at the expected evolutionary position in the HR diagram, i.e. as a PMS star. The distance for HD 141569 found in this work matches the Hipparcos distance, and the problem of its anomalous position is solved as a result of the low metallicity of the object: using the right metallicity tracks, the star is in the PMS region. The SEDs are constructed using data covering ultraviolet to millimetre wavelengths. Physical, non-parametric models, have been applied in order to extract some properties of the disks surrounding the stars. The disk around HD 34282 is accreting actively, it is massive and presents large grains in the mid-plane and small grains in the surface. HD 141569 has a very low mass disk, which is in an intermediate stage towards a debris-type disk.},

	abstract = {Some circumstellar disks, called transitional or hybrid disks, present characteristics of both protoplanetary disks (signiﬁcant amount of gas) and debris disks (evolved structures around young main-sequence stars, composed of second generation dust, from collisions between planetesimals). Therefore, they are ideal astrophysical laboratories to witness the last stages of planet formation. The circumstellar disk around HD141569A was intensively observed and resolved in the past from space, but also from the ground. However, the recent implementation of high contrast imaging systems has opened up new opportunities to re-analyze this object. We analyzed Gemini archival data from the Near-infrared Coronagraphic Imager obtained in 2011 in the H band, using several angular differential imaging techniques (classical ADI, LOCI, KLIP). These images reveal the complex structures of this disk with an unprecedented resolution. We also include archival Hubble Space Telescope images as an independent data set to conﬁrm these ﬁndings. Using an analysis of the inner edge of the disk, we show that the inner disk is almost axisymmetrical. The measurement of an offset toward the east observed by previous authors is likely due to the fact that the eastern part of this disk is wider and more complex in substructure. Our precise reanalysis of the eastern side shows several structures, including a splitting of the disk and a small ﬁnger detached from the inner edge to the southeast. Finally, we ﬁnd that the arc at 250 AU is unlikely to be a spiral, at least not at the inclination derived from the ﬁrst ring, but instead could be interpreted as a third belt at a different inclination. If the very symmetrical inner disk edge is carved by a companion, the data presented here put additional constraints on its position. The observed very complex structures will be conﬁrmed by the new generation of coronagraphic instrument (GPI, SPHERE). However, a full understanding of this system will require gas observations at millimetric wavelengths.},

Keck Observatory Keck II adaptive optics system. We used reference point-spread function subtraction, which reveals the innermost disk component from the inner working distance of ;23 au and up to ;70 au. The spatial scale of our detection roughly corresponds to the optical and near-infrared scattered light, thermal Q, N, and 8.6 μm PAH emission reported earlier. We also see an outward progression in dust location from the L′ band to the H band (Very Large Telescope/SPHERE image) to the visible (Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/STIS image), which is likely indicative of dust blowout. The warm disk component is nested deep inside the two outer belts imaged by HST-NICMOS in 1999 (at 406 and 245 au, respectively). We ﬁt our new L′-band image and spectral energy distribution of HD 141569 A with the radiative transfer code MCFOST. Our best-ﬁt models favor pure olivine grains and are consistent with the composition of the outer belts. While our image shows a putative very faint point-like clump or source embedded in the inner disk, we did not detect any true companion within the gap between the inner disk and the ﬁrst outer ring, at a sensitivity of a few Jupiter masses.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we review the impact of small sample statistics on detection thresholds and corresponding conﬁdence levels (CLs) in high-contrast imaging at small angles. When looking close to the star, the number of resolution elements decreases rapidly toward small angles. This reduction of the number of degrees of freedom dramatically affects CLs and false alarm probabilities. Naively using the same ideal hypothesis and methods as for larger separations, which are well understood and commonly assume Gaussian noise, can yield up to one order of magnitude error in contrast estimations at ﬁxed CL. The statistical penalty exponentially increases toward very small inner working angles. Even at 5–10 resolution elements from the star, false alarm probabilities can be signiﬁcantly higher than expected. Here we present a rigorous statistical analysis that ensures robustness of the CL, but also imposes a substantial limitation on corresponding achievable detection limits (thus contrast) at small angles. This unavoidable fundamental statistical effect has a signiﬁcant impact on current coronagraphic and future high-contrast imagers. Finally, the paper concludes with practical recommendations to account for small number statistics when computing the sensitivity to companions at small angles and when exploiting the results of direct imaging planet surveys.},

	abstract = {Angular differential imaging is a high-contrast imaging technique that reduces quasistatic speckle noise and facilitates the detection of nearby companions. A sequence of images is acquired with an altitude/azimuth telescope while the instrument ﬁeld derotator is switched off. This keeps the instrument and telescope optics aligned and allows the ﬁeld of view to rotate with respect to the instrument. For each image, a reference point-spread function (PSF ) is constructed from other appropriately selected images of the same sequence and subtracted to remove quasistatic PSF structure. All residual images are then rotated to align the ﬁeld and are combined. Observed performances are reported for Gemini North data. It is shown that quasistatic PSF noise can be reduced by a factor \$5 for each image subtraction. The combination of all residuals then provides an additional gain of the order of the square root of the total number of acquired images. A total speckle noise attenuation of 20–50 is obtained for a 1 hr long observing sequence compared to a single 30 s exposure. A PSF noise attenuation of 100 was achieved for a 2 hr long sequence of images of Vega, reaching a 5   contrast of 20 mag for separations greater than 800. For a 30 minute long sequence, ADI achieves signal-to-noise ratios 30 times better than a classical observation technique. The ADI technique can be used with currently available instruments to search for \$1MJup exoplanets with orbits of radii between 50 and 300 AU around nearby young stars. The possibility of combining the technique with other high-contrast imaging methods is brieﬂy discussed.},

The discovered inner disk component, obtained in broadband optical light with Hubble Space Telescope/Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph coronagraphy, was imaged with an inner working angle of 0 25, and can be traced from 0 4 (∼46 AU) to 1 0 (∼116 AU) after deprojection using i=55°. The inner disk component is seen to forward scatter in a manner similar to the previously known rings, has a pericenter offset of ∼6 AU, and break points where the slope of the surface brightness changes. It also has a spiral arm trailing in the same sense as other spiral arms and arcs seen at larger stellocentric distances. The inner disk spatially overlaps with the previously reported warm gas disk seen in thermal emission. We detect no point sources within 2″ (∼232 AU), in particular in the gap between the inner disk component and the inner ring. Our upper limit of 9±3MJ is augmented by a new dynamical limit on single planetary mass bodies in the gap between the inner disk component and the inner ring of 1MJ, which is broadly consistent with previous estimates.},

The nondetection of the 21 lm crystalline silicate feature predicted from the porous dust model composed of highly processed grains (mainly crystalline silicate dust) imposes an upper limit of \$10\% on the mass fraction of crystalline silicates.

In AO systems performing wave front sensing in the visible and scientiﬁc imaging in the near-IR, the PSF contrast limit is set by the scintillation chromaticity induced by Fresnel propagation through the atmosphere. On an 8 m telescope, the PSF contrast is then limited to 10À4 to 10À5 in the central arcsecond. Wave front sensing and scientiﬁc imaging should therefore be done at the same wavelength, in which case, on bright sources, PSF contrasts between 10À6 and 10À7 can be achieved within 100 on an 8 m telescope in optical/near-IR. The impact of atmospheric turbulence parameters (seeing, wind speed, turbulence proﬁle) on the PSF contrast is quantiﬁed.

We analyse images from the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA)1 and the Atacama Large Millimeter/ submillimeter Array (ALMA) in 12CO, 13CO J = 2→1, and 13CO J = 1→0 transitions.

We use simple parametric laws with the Diskﬁt code and MCMC exploration to characterise the gas disc parameters and report a ﬁrst attempt to characterise its chemical content with IRAM-30 m.
Results. The continuum emission is equally shared between a compact ( 50 au) and a smooth, extended dust component (∼350 au).

Conclusions. With the largest amount of dust and gas among hybrid discs, HD 141569A shows coincident characteristics of both protoplanetary discs (central regions), and debris discs at large distance. Together with its morphological characteristics and young age, it appears to be a good candidate to witness the transient phase of gas dissipation, with an apparently large gas-to-dust ratio (G/D {\textgreater} 100) favouring a faster evolution of dust grains.},

	abstract = {Using Keck/NIRC2 L¢ (3.78 μm) data, we report the direct imaging discovery of a scattered-light-resolved, solarsystem-scale residual protoplanetary disk around the young A-type star HD 141569A, interior to and concentric with the two ring-like structures at wider separations. The disk is resolved down to ∼0 25 and appears as an arclike rim with attached hook-like features. It is located at an angular separation intermediate between that of warm CO gas identiﬁed from spatially resolved mid-infrared spectroscopy and diffuse dust emission recently discovered with the Hubble Space Telescope. The inner disk has a radius of ∼39 au, a position angle consistent with northup, andan inclination of i ∼ 56oand has a center offset from the star. Forwardmodeling of the disk favors a thick torus-like emission sharply truncated at separations beyond the torus’s photocenter and heavily depleted at smaller separations. In particular, the best-ﬁt density power law for the dust suggests that the inner disk dust and gas (as probed by CO) are radially segregated, a feature consistent with the dust trapping mechanism inferred from observations of “canonical” transitional disks. However, the inner disk component may instead be explained by radiation pressure-induced migration in optically thin conditions, in contrast to the two stellar companion/planetinﬂuenced ring-like structures at wider separations. HD 141569A’s circumstellar environment—with three nested, gapped, concentric dust populations—is an excellent laboratory for understanding the relationship between planet formation and the evolution of both dust grains and disk architecture.},

The B, V, and I images show that the disk’s previously described multiple-ring structure is actually a continuous distribution of dust with a tightly wound spiral structure. Extending from the disk are two, more open spiral arms, one of which appears to reach the nearby binary star HD 141569BC. Diﬀuse dust is seen up to 1200 AU from HD 141569A. Although planets may exist in the inner region of the disk, tidal interaction with HD 141569BC seems more likely to be the cause of these phenomena. The disk appears redder than the star (BÀV = 0.21 and VÀI = 0.25), and its color is spatially uniform. A scattering asymmetry factor of g ¼ 0:25–0.35 is derived. The azimuthal density distribution is asymmetric, varying by a factor of \$3 at some radii.},

Gemini Planet Imager H-band (1.65 μm) polarimetric differential imaging reveals the highest signal-to-noise ratio detection of this ring yet attained and traces structure inward to 0 25 (28 au at a distance of 111 pc). The radial polarized intensity image shows the east side of the disk, peaking in intensity at 0 40 (44 au) and extending out to 0 9 (100 au). There is a spiral arm–like enhancement to the south, reminiscent of the known spiral structures on the outer rings of the disk. The location of the spiral arm is coincident with 12CO J=3–2 emission detected by ALMA and hints at a dynamically active inner circumstellar region. Our observations also show a portion of the middle dusty ring at ∼220 au known from previous observations of this system. We ﬁt the polarized H-band emission with a continuum radiative transfer Mie model. Our best-ﬁt model favors an optically thin disk with a minimum dust grain size close to the blowout size for this system, evidence of ongoing dust production in the inner reaches of the disk. The thermal emission from this model accounts for virtually all of the far-infrared and millimeter ﬂux from the entire HD141569A disk, in agreement with the lack of ALMA continuum and CO emission beyond ∼100 au. A remaining 8–30 μm thermal excess a factor of ∼2 above our model argues for an as-yet-unresolved warm innermost 5–15 au component of the disk.},

	abstract = {We report here the highest resolution near-IR imaging to date of the HD 141569A disc taken as part of the NICI (near infrared coronagraphic imager) Science Campaign. We recover four main features in the NICI images of the HD 141569 disc discovered in previous Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging: (1) an inner ring/spiral feature. Once deprojected, this feature does not appear circular. (2) An outer ring which is considerably brighter on the western side compared to the eastern side, but looks fairly circular in the deprojected image. (3) An additional arc-like feature between the inner and outer ring only evident on the east side. In the deprojected image, this feature appears to complete the circle of the west side inner ring and (4) an evacuated cavity from 175 au inwards. Compared to the previous HST imaging with relatively large coronagraphic inner working angles (IWA), the NICI coronagraph allows imaging down to an IWA of 0.3 arcsec. Thus, the inner edge of the inner ring/spiral feature is well resolved and we do not ﬁnd any additional disc structures within 175 au. We note some additional asymmetries in this system. Speciﬁcally, while the outer ring structure looks circular in this deprojection, the inner bright ring looks rather elliptical. This suggests that a single deprojection angle is not appropriate for this system and that there may be an offset in inclination between the two ring/spiral features. We ﬁnd an offset of 4 ± 2 au between the inner ring and the star centre, potentially pointing to unseen inner companions.},

	abstract = {We investigate in details the properties of the disk surrounding the 8 Myr old star HR 4796 A, one of the few stars bringing precious clues to better understand the scenario which lead to planetary system formation. We propose a model able to reproduce all the available observations: the full spectral energy distribution from the mid-infrared to the millimeter wavelengths, resolved scattered light and thermal emission observations. We show that the circumstellar matter splits into two dust components: a cold annulus, peaked at 70 AU from the star, made of ISM-like grains (amorphous composition, porosity ∼ 0.6) larger than 10 µm and a population of hot dust close to the star (at about 9 AU) made of comet-like grains (crystalline composition, porosity ∼ 0.97). Both dust populations are highly collisional and the grain size distribution in the cold annulus is found to be cut-off by radiation pressure. At 70 AU, bodies as large as a few meters are required to ﬁt the data leading to a minimum disk mass of a few Earth masses and to a gas to dust ratio less than 1. We discuss aftewards some implications on the disk structure and effects of larger bodies.},

	abstract = {The light scattered from dust grains in debris disks is typically modeled as compact spheres using the Lorenz–Mie theory or as porous spheres by incorporating an effective medium theory. In this work we examine the effect of incorporating a more realistic particle morphology on estimated radiation-pressure blowout sizes. To calculate the scattering and absorption cross-sections of irregularly shaped dust grains, we use the discrete dipole approximation. These cross-sections are necessary to calculate theβ-ratio, which determines whether dust grains can remain gravitationally bound to their star. We calculate blowout sizes for a range of stellar spectral types corresponding with stars known to host debris disks. As with compact spheres, more luminous stars blow out larger irregularly shaped dust grains. We also ﬁnd that dust grain composition inﬂuences blowout size such that absorptive grains are more readily removed from the disk. Moreover, the difference between blowout sizes calculated assuming spherical particles versus particle morphologies more representative of real dust particles is compositionally dependent as well, with blowout size estimates diverging further for transparent grains. We ﬁnd that the blowout sizes calculated have a strong dependence on the particle model used, with differences in the blowout size calculated being as large as an order of magnitude for particles of similar porosities.},

	abstract = {We present the scientiﬁc performance results of PynPoint, our Python-based software package that uses principle component analysis to detect and estimate the ﬂux of exoplanets in two dimensional imaging data. Recent advances in adaptive optics and imaging technology at visible and infrared wavelengths have opened the door to direct detections of planetary companions to nearby stars, but image processing techniques have yet to be optimized. We show that the performance of our approach gives a marked improvement over what is presently possible using existing methods such as LOCI. To test our approach, we use real angular diﬀerential imaging (ADI) data taken with the adaptive optics assisted high resolution near-infrared camera NACO at the VLT. These data were taken during the commissioning of the apodising phase plate (APP) coronagraph. By inserting simulated planets into these data, we test the performance of our method as a function of planet brightness for diﬀerent positions on the image. We ﬁnd that in all cases PynPoint has a detection threshold that is superior to that given by our LOCI analysis when assessed in a common statistical framework. We obtain our best improvements for smaller inner working angles (IWA). For an IWA of ∼0.29 we ﬁnd that we achieve a detection sensitivity that is a factor of 5 better than LOCI. We also investigate our ability to correctly measure the ﬂux of planets. Again, we ﬁnd improvements over LOCI, with PynPoint giving more stable results. Finally, we apply our package to a non-APP dataset of the exoplanet β Pictoris b and reveal the planet with high signal-to-noise. This conﬁrms that PynPoint can potentially be applied with high ﬁdelity to a wide range of high-contrast imaging datasets.},

Furthermore, images of these bodies taken away from perihelion show no evidence for on-going mass-loss (model-dependent limits 1 kg s−1) that might result from thermal disintegration of the surface.

	abstract = {The relationship between the near-Earth objects (3200) Phaethon and (155140) 2005 UD is unclear. While both are parents to meteor showers (the Geminids and Daytime Sextantids, respectively) and have similar visible-wavelength reflectance spectra and orbits, dynamical investigations have failed to find any likely method to link the two objects in the recent past. Here we present the first near-infrared reflectance spectrum of 2005 UD, which shows it to be consistently linear and red-sloped, unlike Phaethon's very blue and concave spectrum. Searching for a process that could alter some common starting material to both of these end states, we hypothesized that the two objects had been heated to different extents, motivated by their near-Sun orbits, the composition of Geminid meteoroids, and previous models of Phaethon's surface. We thus set about building a new laboratory apparatus to acquire reflectance spectra of meteoritic samples after heating to higher temperatures than available in the literature to test this hypothesis and were loaned a sample of the CI chondrite Orgueil from the Vatican Meteorite Collection for testing. We find that while Phaethon's spectrum shares many similarities with different CI chondrites, 2005 UD's does not. We thus conclude that the most likely relationship between the two objects is that their similar properties are only by coincidence as opposed to a parent-fragment scenario, though the ultimate test will be when JAXA's DESTINY+ mission visits one or both of the objects later this decade. We also discuss possible paths forward to understanding Phaethon's properties from dynamical and compositional grounds.},

	abstract = {Thermal infrared emission and thermophysical modeling techniques are powerful tools in deciphering the surface properties of asteroids. The near-Earth asteroid (3200) Phaethon is an active asteroid with a very small perihelion distance and is likely the source of the Geminid meteor shower. Using a thermophysical model with a non-convex shape of Phaethon we interpret thermal infrared observations that span ten distinct sightings. The results yield an effective diameter of 5 . 4 ± 0 . 1 km and independent thermal inertia estimates for each sighting. We find that the thermal inertia varies across each of these sightings in a way that is stronger than the theoretical temperature-dependent expectation from radiative heat transfer within the regolith. Thus, we test whether the variation in thermal inertia can be explained by the presence of a regolith layer over bedrock, or by a spatially heterogeneous scenario. We find that a model in which Phaethon's hemispheres have distinctly different thermophysical properties can sufficiently explain the thermal inertias determined herein. In particular, we find that a boundary is located between latitudes - 30∘ and + 10∘ that separates two regions: a fine-grained southern latitudes and a northern hemisphere that is dominated by coarse-grained regolith and/or a high coverage of porous boulders. We discuss the implications related to Phaethon's activity, potential association with 2005 UD, and the upcoming DESTINY+ mission.},

              We present the second
              Gaia
              data release,
              Gaia
              DR2, consisting of astrometry, photometry, radial velocities, and information on astrophysical parameters and variability, for sources brighter than magnitude 21. In addition epoch astrometry and photometry are provided for a modest sample of minor planets in the solar system.
            
            
              Aims.
              A summary of the contents of
              Gaia
              DR2 is presented, accompanied by a discussion on the differences with respect to
              Gaia
              DR1 and an overview of the main limitations which are still present in the survey. Recommendations are made on the responsible use of
              Gaia
              DR2 results.
            
            
              Methods.
              The raw data collected with the
              Gaia
              instruments during the first 22 months of the mission have been processed by the
              Gaia
              Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) and turned into this second data release, which represents a major advance with respect to
              Gaia
              DR1 in terms of completeness, performance, and richness of the data products.
              Results. Gaia
              DR2 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in
              G
              for approximately 1.7 billion sources. For 1.3 billion of those sources, parallaxes and proper motions are in addition available. The sample of sources for which variability information is provided is expanded to 0.5 million stars. This data release contains four new elements: broad-band colour information in the form of the apparent brightness in the
              G
              BP
              (330–680 nm) and
              G
              RP
              (630–1050 nm) bands is available for 1.4 billion sources; median radial velocities for some 7 million sources are presented; for between 77 and 161 million sources estimates are provided of the stellar effective temperature, extinction, reddening, and radius and luminosity; and for a pre-selected list of 14 000 minor planets in the solar system epoch astrometry and photometry are presented. Finally,
              Gaia
              DR2 also represents a new materialisation of the celestial reference frame in the optical, the
              Gaia
              -CRF2, which is the first optical reference frame based solely on extragalactic sources. There are notable changes in the photometric system and the catalogue source list with respect to
              Gaia
              DR1, and we stress the need to consider the two data releases as independent.
              Conclusions. Gaia
              DR2 represents a major achievement for the
              Gaia
              mission, delivering on the long standing promise to provide parallaxes and proper motions for over 1 billion stars, and representing a first step in the availability of complementary radial velocity and source astrophysical information for a sample of stars in the
              Gaia
              survey which covers a very substantial fraction of the volume of our galaxy.},

              The near-Earth asteroid 3200 Phaethon (1983 TB) is an attractive object not only from a scientific viewpoint but also because of JAXA’s DESTINY
              +
              target. The rotational lightcurve and spin properties were investigated based on the data obtained in the ground-based observation campaign of Phaethon.
            
            
              Aims.
              We aim to refine the lightcurves and shape model of Phaethon using all available lightcurve datasets obtained via optical observation, as well as our time-series observation data from the 2017 apparition.
            
            
              Methods.
              Using eight 12-m telescopes and an optical imager, we acquired the optical lightcurves and derived the spin parameters of Phaethon. We applied the lightcurve inversion method and SAGE algorithm to deduce the convex and non-convex shape model and pole orientations.
            
            
              Results.
              We analysed the optical lightcurve of Phaethon and derived a synodic and a sidereal rotational periods of 3.6039 h, with an axis ratio of
              a
              ∕
              b
              = 1.07. The ecliptic longitude (
              λ
              p
              ) and latitude (
              β
              p
              ) of the pole orientation were determined as (308°, −52°) and (322°, −40°) via two independent methods. A non-convex model from the SAGE method, which exhibits a concavity feature, is also presented.},

	abstract = {Time-series multi-band photometry and spectrometry were performed in Nov.-Dec. 2017 to investigate the homogeneity of the surface of asteroid (3200) Phaethon. We found that Phaethon is a B-type asteroid, in agreement with previous studies, and that it shows no evidence for rotational color variation. The sub-solar latitude during our observation period was approximately 55 °S, which corresponded to the southern hemisphere of Phaethon. Thus, we found that the southern hemisphere of Phaethon has a homogeneous surface. We compared our spectra with existing spectral data to examine the latitudinal surface properties of Phaethon. The result showed that it doesn't have a latitudinal color variation. To explain this observation, we investigated the solar-radiation heating effect on Phaethon, and the result suggested that Phaethon underwent a uniform thermal metamorphism regardless of latitude, which was consistent with our observations. Based on this result, we discuss the homogeneity of the surface of Phaethon.},

    "abstract": "Let $λ$ denote the Liouville function. We show that the logarithmic mean of $λ(\\lfloor α_1n\\rfloor)λ(\\lfloor α_2n\\rfloor)$ is $0$ whenever $α_1,α_2$ are positive reals with $α_1/α_2$ irrational. We also show that for $k\\geq 3$ the logarithmic mean of $λ(\\lfloor α_1n\\rfloor)\\cdots λ(\\lfloor α_kn\\rfloor)$ has some nontrivial amount of cancellation, under certain rational independence assumptions on the real numbers $α_i$. Our results for the Liouville function generalise to produce independence statements for general bounded real-valued multiplicative functions evaluated at Beatty sequences. These results answer the two-point case of a conjecture of Frantzikinakis (and provide some progress on the higher order cases), generalising a recent result of Crnčević--Hernández--Rizk--Sereesuchart--Tao.\n  As an ingredient in our proofs, we establish bounds for the logarithmic correlations of the Liouville function along Bohr sets.",

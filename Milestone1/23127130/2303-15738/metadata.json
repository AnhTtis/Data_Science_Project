    "abstract": "Each $r$--Dehn filling of the exterior $E(K)$ of a knot $K$ in $S^3$ produces a $3$--manifold $K(r)$, and induces an epimorphism from the knot group $G(K) = π_1(E(K))$ to $π_1(K(r))$, which trivializes elements in its kernel. To each element $g \\in G(K)$, consider all the non-trivial Dehn fillings and assign $\\mathcal{S}_K(g) = \\{ r \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\mid \\textrm{$r$--Dehn filling trivializes}\\ g \\}$ $\\subset \\mathbb{Q}$. {\\it Which subsets of $\\mathbb{Q}$ can occur as $\\mathcal{S}_K(g)$?} Property P concerns this question and gives a fundamental result which asserts that the emptyset can be realized by $\\mathcal{S}_K(μ)$ for the meridian $μ$ of $K$. Suppose that $K$ is a hyperbolic knot. Then $\\mathcal{S}_K(g)$ is known to be finite for all non-trivial elements $g \\in G(K)$. We prove that generically, for instance, if $K$ has no exceptional surgery, then any finite (possibly empty) family of slopes $\\mathcal{R} = \\{ r_1, . . . , r_n \\}$ can be realized by $\\mathcal{S}_K(g)$ for some element $g \\in G(K)$. Furthermore, there are infinitely many, mutually non-conjugate such elements, each of which is not conjugate to any power of $g$. We also provide an example showing that the above realization property does not hold unconditionally.",

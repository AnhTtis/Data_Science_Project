An analogy or a simulation is pointed out between the Weyl fermion theory and gapless semiconductors where two energy bands have pointlike degeneracies. For such materials, in the presence of parallel electric and strong magnetic fields, there exists an effect similar to the ABJ anomaly that is the movement of the electrons in the energy-momentum space from the neighborhood of one degeneracy point to another one. The longitudinal magneto-conduction becomes extremely strong.}

abstract = {Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) usually show simple structures, however, with interesting properties. Recently some TMDs have been pointed out as type-II Dirac semimetals. In the present work, we investigate the physical properties of a new candidate for type-II Dirac semimetal and investigate the effect of titanium doping on physical properties of Ti-doped single crystalline samples of NiTe2. It was found that this compound shows superconducting properties with a critical temperature close to 4.0 K. Interestingly, applied pressures up to 1.3 GPa have no effect upon the superconducting state. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate the presence of a Dirac cone in the band structure of NiTe2 literature when Spin-Orbit Coupling (SOC) is included, which is in agreement with a recent report for this compound. Also, our calculations demonstrate that Ti suppresses the formation of these non-trivial states.}

title = {Pairing state at an interface of Sr2RuO4: parity-mixing, restored time-reversal symmetry and topological superconductivity},
journal = {New Journal of Physics},
abstract = {We investigate pairing states realized at the (001) interface of a spin-triplet superconductor Sr2RuO4 on the basis of microscopic calculations. Because of a Rashba-type spin–orbit interaction induced at the interface, strong parity-mixing of Cooper pairs between a spin-singlet state and a spin-triplet state occurs in this system. There are also strong inter-band pair correlations between the spin–orbit split bands, in spite of the considerably large spin–orbit splitting. This is due to frustration between the spin–orbit interaction and pairing interactions. In this pairing state, time-reversal symmetry is restored, in contrast to the bulk Sr2RuO4, which is believed to be a chiral p+ip superconductor with broken time-reversal symmetry. It is demonstrated that, because of these features, the pairing state at the interface is a promising candidate for the recently proposed time-reversal invariant topological superconductor.}

journal = {Europhysics Letters},
abstract = {We predict a new class of three-dimensional topological insulators in thallium-based III-V-VI2 ternary chalcogenides, including TlBiQ2 and TlSbQ2 (Q=Te, Se and S). These topological insulators have robust and simple surface states consisting of a single Dirac cone at the Γ point. The mechanism for topological insulating behavior is elucidated using both first-principle calculations and effective field theory models. Remarkably, one topological insulator in this class, TlBiTe2, is also a superconductor when doped with p-type carriers. We discuss the possibility that this material could be a topological superconductor. Another material, TlSbS2, is on the border between topological insulator and trivial insulator phases, in which a topological phase transition can be driven by pressure.}

abstract = {A general framework is developed to aid the diagnosis of nontrivial topology in superconductors using their symmetry properties. Topological superconductors are exotic phases of matter featuring robust surface states that could be leveraged for topological quantum computation. A useful guiding principle for the search of topological superconductors is to relate the topological invariants with the behavior of the pairing order parameter on the normal-state Fermi surfaces. The existing formulas, however, become inadequate for the prediction of the recently proposed classes of topological crystalline superconductors. In this work, we advance the theory of symmetry indicators for topological (crystalline) superconductors to cover all space groups. Our main result is the exhaustive computation of the indicator groups for superconductors under a variety of symmetry settings. We further illustrate the power of this approach by analyzing fourfold symmetric superconductors with or without inversion symmetry and show that the indicators can diagnose topological superconductors with surface states of different dimensionalities or dictate gaplessness in the bulk excitation spectrum.}}

abstract = {Bulk NiTe2 is a type-II Dirac semimetal with non-trivial Berry phases associated with the Dirac fermions. Theory suggests that monolayer NiTe2 is a two-gap superconductor, whereas experimental investigation of bulk NiTe1.98 for pressures (P) up to 71.2 GPa do not reveal any superconductivity. Here we report experimental evidences for pressure-induced two-phase superconductivity as well as mixed structures of NiTe2 and NiTe in Te-deficient NiTe2-x (x = 0.38 ± 0.09) single crystals. Hole-dominant multi-band superconductivity with the P3¯m1 hexagonal-symmetry structure of NiTe2 appears at P ≥ 0.5 GPa, whereas electron-dominant single-band superconductivity with the P2/m monoclinic-symmetry structure of NiTe emerges at 14.5 GPa < P < 18.4 GPa. The coexistence of hexagonal and monoclinic structures and two-phase superconductivity is accompanied by a zero Hall coefficient up to ∼ 40 GPa, and the second superconducting phase prevails above 40 GPa, reaching a maximum Tc = 7.8 K and persisting up to 52.8 GPa. Our findings suggest the critical role of Te-vacancies in the occurrence of superconductivity and potentially nontrivial topological properties in NiTe2-x.}

abstract = {A new class of materials that are insulating in the bulk and on surfaces but have conducting hinge channels is studied. Three-dimensional topological (crystalline) insulators are materials with an insulating bulk but conducting surface states that are topologically protected by time-reversal (or spatial) symmetries. We extend the notion of three-dimensional topological insulators to systems that host no gapless surface states but exhibit topologically protected gapless hinge states. Their topological character is protected by spatiotemporal symmetries of which we present two cases: (i) Chiral higher-order topological insulators protected by the combination of time-reversal and a fourfold rotation symmetry. Their hinge states are chiral modes, and the bulk topology is Z2-classified. (ii) Helical higher-order topological insulators protected by time-reversal and mirror symmetries. Their hinge states come in Kramers pairs, and the bulk topology is Z-classified. We provide the topological invariants for both cases. Furthermore, we show that SnTe as well as surface-modified Bi2TeI, BiSe, and BiTe are helical higher-order topological insulators and propose a realistic experimental setup to detect the hinge states.}}

title = {Realization of low-energy type-II Dirac fermions in (Ir1−xPtx)Te2 superconductors*},
journal = {Chinese Physics B},
abstract = {Topological Dirac semimetals (DSMs) present a kind of topologically nontrivial quantum state of matter, which has massless Dirac fermions in the bulk and topologically protected states on certain surfaces. In superconducting DSMs, the effects of their nontrivial topology on superconducting pairing could realize topological superconductivity in the bulk or on the surface. As superconducting pairing takes place at the Fermi level EF, to make the effects possible, the Dirac points should lie in the vicinity of EF so that the topological electronic states can participate in the superconducting paring. Here, we show using angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy that in a series of (Ir1−xPtx)Te2 compounds, the type-II Dirac points reside around EF in the superconducting region, in which the bulk superconductivity has a maximum Tc of ∼ 3 K. The realization of the coexistence of bulk superconductivity and low-energy Dirac fermions in (Ir1−xPtx)Te2 paves the way for studying the effects of the nontrivial topology in DSMs on the superconducting state.}

abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) materials have gained lots of attention due to the potential applications. In this work, we propose that based on first-principles calculations, the (2 × 2) patterned PtTe2 monolayer with kagome lattice formed by the well-ordered Te vacancy (PtTe1.75) hosts large and tunable spin Hall conductivity (SHC) and excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. The unconventional nature relies on the A1 @ 1b band representation of the highest valence band without spin–orbit coupling (SOC). The large SHC comes from the Rashba SOC in the noncentrosymmetric structure induced by the Te vacancy. Even though it has a metallic SOC band structure, the ℤ2 invariant is well defined because of the existence of the direct bandgap and is computed to be nontrivial. The calculated SHC is as large as 1.25 × 103 ℏe (Ω cm)−1 at the Fermi level (EF). By tuning the chemical potential from EF − 0.3 to EF + 0.3 eV, it varies rapidly and monotonically from −1.2 × 103 to 3.1 ×103ℏeΩ\&nbsp;cm−1. In addition, we also find that the Te vacancy in the patterned monolayer can induce excellent HER activity. Our results not only offer a new idea to search 2D materials with large SHC, i.e., by introducing inversion–symmetry breaking vacancies in large SOC systems, but also provide a feasible system with tunable SHC (by applying gate voltage) and excellent HER activity.}}

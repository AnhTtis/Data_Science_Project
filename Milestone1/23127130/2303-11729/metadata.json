    "abstract": "Type-II Dirac semimetals (DSMs) have a distinct Fermi surface topology, which allows them to host novel topological superconductivity (TSC) different from type-I DSMs. Depending on the relationship between intra- and inter-orbital electron-electron interactions, the phase diagram of superconductivity is obtained in type-II DSMs. We find that when the inter-orbital attraction is dominant, an unconventional inter-orbital intra-spin superconducting (SC) state ($B_{1u}$ and $B_{2u}$ pairing channels of $D_{4h}$ point group) is realized, yielding hybrid TSC, i.e., first- and second-order TSC exists at the same time. Further analysis reveals the Majorana flat bands on the $z$-directed hinges, which penetrate through the whole hinge Brillouin zone and link the projections of the surface helical Majorana cones at time-reversal-invariant momenta. These higher-order hinge modes are symmetry-protected and can even host strong stability against finite $C_{4z}$ rotation symmetry-breaking order. We suggest that experimental realization of these findings can be explored in transition metal dichalcogenides.",

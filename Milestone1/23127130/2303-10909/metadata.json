    "abstract": "Traffic forecasting is one of the most popular spatio-temporal tasks in the field of machine learning. A prevalent approach in the field is to combine graph convolutional networks and recurrent neural networks for the spatio-temporal processing. There has been fierce competition and many novel methods have been proposed. In this paper, we present the method of spatio-temporal graph neural rough differential equation (STG-NRDE). Neural rough differential equations (NRDEs) are a breakthrough concept for processing time-series data. Their main concept is to use the log-signature transform to convert a time-series sample into a relatively shorter series of feature vectors. We extend the concept and design two NRDEs: one for the temporal processing and the other for the spatial processing. After that, we combine them into a single framework. We conduct experiments with 6 benchmark datasets and 21 baselines. STG-NRDE shows the best accuracy in all cases, outperforming all those 21 baselines by non-trivial margins.",

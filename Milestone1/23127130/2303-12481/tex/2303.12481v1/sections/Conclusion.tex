\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we have introduced a family of parameter-free, fast, and parallelizable algorithms for crafting optimal adversarial perturbations. Our proposed algorithm, SuperDeepFool, outperforms state-of-the-art $\ell_2$-norm attacks, while maintaining a small computational cost. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of SuperDeepFool in various scenarios. Furthermore, we have shown that adversarial training using the examples generated by SuperDeepFool builds more robust models. For future work, one potential avenue could be to extend SuperDeepFool families to other threat models, such as general $\ell_{p}$-norms.

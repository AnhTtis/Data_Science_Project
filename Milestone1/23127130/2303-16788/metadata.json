    "abstract": "We consider the problem of fairly allocating a set of indivisible goods among $n$ agents with additive valuations, using the popular fairness notion of maximin share (MMS). Since MMS allocations do not always exist, a series of works provided existence and algorithms for approximate MMS allocations. The current best approximation factor, for which the existence is known, is $(\\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{1}{12n})$ [Garg and Taki, 2021]. Most of these results are based on complicated analyses, especially those providing better than $2/3$ factor. Moreover, since no tight example is known of the Garg-Taki algorithm, it is unclear if this is the best factor of this approach. In this paper, we significantly simplify the analysis of this algorithm and also improve the existence guarantee to a factor of $(\\frac{3}{4} + \\min(\\frac{1}{36}, \\frac{3}{16n-4}))$. For small $n$, this provides a noticeable improvement. Furthermore, we present a tight example of this algorithm, showing that this may be the best factor one can hope for with the current techniques.",

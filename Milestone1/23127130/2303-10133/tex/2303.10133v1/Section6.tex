\section{Conclusion, Limitation, and Future Work}

In this paper, we consider the finite horizon trajectory planning problem for robot navigation and presented a trajectory cost function for robot navigation. Our approach extends the MPEPC navigation algorithm and considerably improves the performance in terms of avoiding deadlocks or freezing behaviors. Particularly, our proposed collision probability formulation is a function of the obstacle distance and the time to collision and is less conservative in terms of collision evaluation of the trajectory. In addition, we also propose a terminal state cost function using the time-to-goal and time-to-collision values which aid in reducing the deadlock in our evaluation scenarios. We evaluated the proposed cost function in a variety of scenarios and generates impressive navigation behavior. The overall algorithm is fast and simple and provides realtime performance in our benchmarks.

Our approach has some limitations. Some of them arise from the underlying optimization framework used for MPC or MPEPC. Though our modified cost shows improved deadlock-reducing behavior in the evaluated scenarios, it can still cause locally optimal behavior due to the finite horizon optimization. In future work, we plan to perform more evaluation of our cost function on complex simulated environments and physical robots. Besides, we plan to evaluate the terminal state cost to study the effects of the parameters $\sigma_{1/TTC}$ and $\sigma_{1/TTG}$ on the navigation and deadlocking behavior. We would like to evaluate the performance in complex real-world and synthetic scenarios.

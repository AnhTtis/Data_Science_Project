\begin{abstract}
We present an algorithm for safe robot navigation in complex dynamic environments using a variant of model predictive equilibrium point control. We use an optimization formulation to navigate robots gracefully in dynamic environments by optimizing over a trajectory cost function at each timestep. We present a novel trajectory cost formulation that significantly reduces the conservative and deadlock behaviors and generates smooth trajectories. % %In this paper, we propose critical modifications to the trajectory cost formulation that reduces conservative and deadlocking behavior in MPEPC formulation. 
In particular, we propose a new collision probability function that effectively captures the risk associated with a given configuration and the time to avoid collisions based on the velocity direction. Moreover, we propose a terminal state cost based on the expected time-to-goal and time-to-collision values that helps in avoiding trajectories that could result in deadlock. We evaluate our cost formulation in multiple simulated and real-world scenarios, including narrow corridors with dynamic obstacles, and observe significantly improved navigation behavior and reduced deadlocks as compared to prior methods.

% Safe robot navigation in real-life circumstances is complicated as the environment is innately uncertain and dynamic due to pedestrians and other dynamic agents. Model predictive equilibrium point control (MPEPC)~\cite{park_mpepc} provides an efficient framework to navigate robots gracefully in dynamic environments. MPEPC frames the navigation problem as a finite horizon trajectory optimization problem, making an informed decision at each timestep by predicting the future behaviors of pedestrians and other agents. In this paper, we propose critical modifications to the cost formulation to reduce freezing behavior in the MPEPC navigation framework. Firstly, we propose a modified collision probability that effectively captures the risk associated with being at a configuration and the time to avoid collision based on the velocity direction. Secondly, we propose a novel terminal cost term based on expected time-to-goal value which aids in preferentially avoiding trajectories that result in freezing behavior. Further, we show that the modified cost function maintains safety. We evaluate our formulation in a variety of simulated scenarios and observe significantly improved navigation behavior.

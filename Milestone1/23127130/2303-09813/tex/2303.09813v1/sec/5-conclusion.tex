\section{Conclusion}


Diffusion model has shown remarkable success on generative tasks. 
In this paper, we propose \methodName to further explore its ability on discriminative tasks.
We build a synthetic dataset using AttentionCut to generate image-mask pairs, and use diffusion inversion to exploit diffusion features for training a segment decoder. Our \methodName shows privilege and achieves new SOTA on all benchmarks.
We expect our work to make a positive step towards unifying generative and discriminative tasks in one model.

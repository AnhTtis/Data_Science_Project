    "abstract": "Most granular packings possess shear moduli ($G$) that increase with the applied external pressure, and bulk moduli ($B$) that increase or remain constant with pressure. This paper presents \"tessellated\" granular metamaterials for which both $G$ and the ratio $G/B$ decrease with increasing pressure. The granular metamaterials are made from flexible tessellations forming a ring of closed cells, each containing a small number of solid particles. For under-constrained tessellations, the dominant contributions to $G$ and $B$ are the particle-particle and particle-cell interactions. With specific particle configurations in the cells, we limit the number of possible particle rearrangements to achieve decreasing $G$ as we increase the pressure difference between the inside and outside of the tessellation, leading to $G/B \\ll 1$ at large pressures. We further study tessellated granular metamaterials with cells containing a single particle and many particles to determine the variables that control the mechanical response of particle-filled tessellations as a function of pressure.",

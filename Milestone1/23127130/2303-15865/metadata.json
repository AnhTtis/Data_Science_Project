    "abstract": "The erosion of chloride ions in concrete bridges will accelerate the corrosion of reinforcement, which is an important reason for the decline of bridge durability. The erosion process of chloride ion, especially deicing salt solution in cold regions, is complex and has many influencing factors. It is very important to use accurate and effective methods to analyze the chloride ion erosion process in concrete. In this study, the pre-stressed concrete bridge retired in the cold region was taken as the research object, and the specimens from the whole bridge are obtained by the method of core drilling sampling. The concentration of chloride ion was measured at different depths of the specimens. The process of chloride ion erosion was simulated in two-dimensional space through COMSOL multi-physical field simulation, and compared with the measured results. The simulation method proposed in this paper has good reliability and accuracy.",

    "abstract": "At a hyperbolic critical energy of a one-dimensional random discrete Schrödinger operator, by definition all transfer matrices commute and have their spectrum off the unit circle. If, moreover, the Lyapunov exponent vanishes, then the hyperbolic critical energy is called balanced. Such balanced hyperbolic critical energies exist in a random hopping Hamiltonian and at topological phase transitions of a generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. The main result shows that the density of states has a logarithmic divergence at these critical energies. The proof is based on renewal theory for the Prüfer phase dynamics and the optional stopping theorem for suitably constructed comparison martingales.",

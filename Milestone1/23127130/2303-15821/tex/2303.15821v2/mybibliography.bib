abstract="Many real-world security scenarios can be modeled via a game-theoretic framework known as a security game in which there is a defender trying to protect potential targets from an attacker. Recent work in security games has shown that deceptive signaling by the defender can convince an attacker to withdraw his attack. For instance, a warning message to commuters indicating speed enforcement is in progress ahead might lead to them driving more slowly, even if it turns out no enforcement is in progress. However, the results of this work are limited by the unrealistic assumption that the attackers will behave with perfect rationality, meaning they always choose an action that gives them the best expected reward. We address the problem of training boundedly rational (human) attackers to comply with signals via repeated interaction with signaling without incurring a loss to the defender, and offer the four following contributions: (i) We learn new decision tree and neural network-based models of attacker compliance with signaling. (ii) Based on these machine learning models of a boundedly rational attacker's response to signaling, we develop a theory of signaling in the Goldilocks zone, a balance of signaling and deception that increases attacker compliance and improves defender utility. (iii) We present game-theoretic algorithms to solve for signaling schemes based on the learned models of attacker compliance with signaling. (iv) We conduct extensive human subject experiments using an online game. The game simulates the scenario of an inside attacker trying to steal sensitive information from company computers, and results show that our algorithms based on learned models of attacker behavior lead to better attacker compliance and improved defender utility compared to the state-of-the-art algorithm for rational attackers with signaling.",

Applications of evolutionary algorithms to non-cooperative simultaneous games have been limited due to challenges in guiding the evolutionary search toward equilibria, which are usually inferior points in the objective space. We propose a regret-based approach to select candidate decision options of the players for the next generation in a multi-population genetic algorithm called Regret-Based Nash Equilibrium Sorting Genetic Algorithm (RNESGA). We show that RNESGA can converge to multiple Nash equilibria in a single run using two and threeplayer competitive knapsack games and other games from the literature. We also show that pure payoff-based fitness assignment strategies perform poorly in three- player games.}",

abstract="This article describes a set function that maps a set of Pareto optimal points to a scalar. A theorem is presented that shows that the maximization of this scalar value constitutes the necessary and sufficient condition for the function's arguments to be maximally diverse Pareto optimal solutions of a discrete, multi-objective, optimization problem. This scalar quantity, a hypervolume based on a Lebesgue measure, is therefore the best metric to assess the quality of multiobjective optimization algorithms. Moreover, it can be used as the objective function in simulated annealing (SA) to induce convergence in probability to the Pareto optima. An efficient, polynomial-time algorithm for calculating this scalar and an analysis of its complexity is also presented.",

abstract = {This paper proposes and demonstrates a new interactive framework for sensitivity-informed de Novo planning to confront the deep uncertainty within water management problems. The framework couples global sensitivity analysis using Sobol’ variance decomposition with multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) to generate planning alternatives and test their robustness to new modeling assumptions and scenarios. We explore these issues within the context of a risk-based water supply management problem, where a city seeks the most efficient use of a water market. The case study examines a single city’s water supply in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) in Texas, using a suite of 6-objective problem formulations that have increasing decision complexity for both a 10-year planning horizon and an extreme single-year drought scenario. The de Novo planning framework demonstrated illustrates how to adaptively improve the value and robustness of our problem formulations by evolving our definition of optimality while discovering key tradeoffs.}

abstract = {In a class of games known as Stackelberg games, one agent (the leader) must commit to a strategy that can be observed by the other agent (the follower or adversary) before the adversary chooses its own strategy. We consider Bayesian Stackelberg games, in which the leader is uncertain about the types of adversary it may face. Such games are important in security domains, where, for example, a security agent (leader) must commit to a strategy of patrolling certain areas, and a robber (follower) has a chance to observe this strategy over time before choosing its own strategy of where to attack. This paper presents an efficient exact algorithm for finding the optimal strategy for the leader to commit to in these games. This algorithm, DOBSS, is based on a novel and compact mixed-integer linear programming formulation. Compared to the most efficient algorithm known previously for this problem, DOBSS is not only faster, but also leads to higher quality solutions, and does not suffer from problems of infeasibility that were faced by this previous algorithm. Note that DOBSS is at the heart of the ARMOR system that is currently being tested for security scheduling at the Los Angeles International Airport.},

abstract = {Bilevel programming involves two optimization problems where the constraint region of the first level problem is implicitly determined by another optimization problem. This paper develops a genetic algorithm for the linear bilevel problem in which both objective functions are linear and the common constraint region is a polyhedron. Taking into account the existence of an extreme point of the polyhedron which solves the problem, the algorithm aims to combine classical extreme point enumeration techniques with genetic search methods by associating chromosomes with extreme points of the polyhedron. The numerical results show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. In addition, this genetic algorithm can also be used for solving quasiconcave bilevel problems provided that the second level objective function is linear.}

abstract = {Nash equilibrium constitutes a central solution concept in game theory. The task of detecting the Nash equilibria of a finite strategic game remains a challenging problem up-to-date. This paper investigates the effectiveness of three computational intelligence techniques, namely, covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategies, particle swarm optimization, as well as, differential evolution, to compute Nash equilibria of finite strategic games, as global minima of a real-valued, nonnegative function. An issue of particular interest is to detect more than one Nash equilibria of a game. The performance of the considered computational intelligence methods on this problem is investigated using multistart and deflection.}

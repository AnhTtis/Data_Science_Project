\section{Conclusions}

Overall, \methodname{} offers a promising approach to the problem of reconstructing both open and watertight models from multi-view images. Its advantages over existing methods lie in the use of  a simple and more accurate density function, and a smooth differentiable UDF representation, so that the learned UDF approximates the ground truth as much as possible. A two-stage learning strategy further eliminates bias and improves UDF accuracy.
Results from our experiments on the DeepFashion3D, DTU and BlendedMVS datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, particularly in learning smooth and stably open UDFs revealing the robustness of \methodname{}. Moreover, our method does not rely on object masks for open model reconstruction, making it more practical in real-world applications.

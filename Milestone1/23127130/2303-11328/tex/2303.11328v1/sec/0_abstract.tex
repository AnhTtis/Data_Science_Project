%Given a single image of an object, we present a method, \textbf{Zero-1-to-3}, to generate another image of the same object from any viewpoint. Large-scale pretrained diffusion models contain rich semantic and geometric priors about objects, but they lack a way to extract and control. To this end, we create a synthetic dataset with \textit{Objaverse} and fine-tune \textit{Stable Diffusion} to generate novel views, conditioned on an input view and the relative viewpoint transformation. Our viewpoint-conditioned diffusion approach can further be used for the task of 3D reconstruction from a single image. Even though it is trained on a synthetic dataset, our model retains a strong generalization ability to out-of-distribution datasets as well as in-the-wild images, including impressionist paintings. Qualitative and quantitative experiments show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art single-view 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis models by capitalizing on internet-scale pertaining.

We introduce Zero-1-to-3, a framework for changing the camera viewpoint of an object given just a single RGB image. To perform novel view synthesis in this under-constrained setting, we capitalize on the geometric priors that large-scale diffusion models learn about natural images. Our conditional diffusion model uses a synthetic dataset to learn controls of the relative camera viewpoint, which allow new images to be generated of the same object under a specified camera transformation. Even though it is trained on a synthetic dataset, our model retains a strong zero-shot generalization ability to out-of-distribution datasets as well as in-the-wild images, including impressionist paintings. Our viewpoint-conditioned diffusion approach can further be used for the task of 3D reconstruction from a single image. Qualitative and quantitative experiments show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art single-view 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis models by leveraging Internet-scale pre-training.

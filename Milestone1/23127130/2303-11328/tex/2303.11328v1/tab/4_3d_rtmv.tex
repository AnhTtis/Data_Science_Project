    \textbf{Results for single view 3D reconstruction on RTMV.}
    Because RTMV consists of cluttered scenes with many objects in them, none of the studied approaches seem to perform very well. Our method is still the best one however, despite not being explicitly trained for the 3D reconstruction task.

models of learning, memory and development in neural circuits. To generate 
realistic results, synapse-specific Hebbian forms of plasticity, such as 
long-term potentiation and depression, must be augmented by global processes 
that regulate overall levels of neuronal and network activity. Regulatory 
processes are often as important as the more intensively studied Hebbian 
processes in determining the consequences of synaptic plasticity for network 
function. Recent experimental results suggest several novel mechanisms for 
regulating levels of activity in conjunction with Hebbian synaptic modification. 
We review three of them-synaptic scaling, spike-timing dependent plasticity and 
synaptic redistribution-and discuss their functional implications.}, Bdsk-url-1

maintenance is widely believed to involve long-term retention of the synaptic 
weights that are set within relevant neural circuits during learning. However, 
despite recent exciting technical advances, it has not yet proved possible to 
confirm experimentally this intuitively appealing hypothesis. Artificial neural 
networks offer an alternative methodology as they permit continuous monitoring 
of individual connection weights during learning and retention. In such models, 
ongoing alterations in connection weights are required if a network is to retain 
previously stored material while learning new information. Thus, the duration of 
synaptic change does not necessarily define the persistence of a memory; rather, 
it is likely that a regulated balance of synaptic stability and synaptic 
plasticity is required for optimal memory retention in real neuronal circuits.},

activity and is a likely basis for memory. The early apparent simplicity of the 
process of synaptic plasticity has been lost in a flood of experimental data 
that now implicates some 200 signaling molecules in cellular memory. It is now 
clear that these signaling networks perform surprisingly sophisticated cellular 
decisions that weigh factors such as input patterns, location of stimulus, 
history of activity, and context. Computer models have followed experiments into 
this maze of molecular detail, often matching closely with their experimental 
counterparts, but perhaps losing simplicity in the process. Here, we suggest 
that the merger of models and experiment have begun to restore the earlier 
simplicity by outlining a few key functional roles for signaling networks in 
synaptic plasticity. In this review, we discuss the current state of

  Abstract                 = {INTRODUCTION: The physiological mechanisms 
involved in neurotransmitter release were established thanks to the pioneer work 
of Katz, Del Castillo and Miledi at the neuromuscular junction. They termed 
their work as the quantal hypothesis of synaptic transmission. This hypothesis 
was further established morphologically by the work of Heuser and Reese. 
However, the molecular events underlying this process are poorly understood. We 
are starting to know which proteins interact between the vesicle and plasma 
membrane to promote fusion and to identify which molecules participate in the 
sensing of cytosolic calcium. DEVELOPMENT: Thanks to the combination of 
molecular biology, electrophysiology and microfluorometry, a huge amount of new 
information is been obtained on the mechanisms participating in synaptic 
transmission. This data deals with processes concerning to different pools of 
synaptic vesicles and their availability to reach the presynaptic membrane; the 
molecular events responsible for the targeting of these vesicles with the plasma 
membrane; the sensitivity to calcium at the presynaptic membrane; the fusion of 
membranes required to release the vesicle contents, and the mechanisms 
responsible for membrane retrieval needed for presynaptic homeostasis. 
CONCLUSIONS: In this review we discuss new data regarding synaptic function. 
However, some key points are still a matter of controversy. Meanwhile the 
quantal hypothesis is valid, the precise processes by which channels and 
vesicles interact, membrane is recycled and vesicles reused are still 
controversial. New techniques should be developed to address these points.},

expected to be sensitive to both the distribution and dynamics of membrane 
voltages within the population. Voltage fluctuations can be driven by synaptic 
noise, neuromodulators, or cellular inhomogeneities: processes ranging from 
millisecond autocorrelation times to effectively static or "frozen" noise. Here 
we extend previous studies of filtered fluctuations to the experimentally 
verified exponential integrate-and-fire model. How fast or frozen fluctuations 
affect the steady-state rate and firing-rate response are both examined using 
perturbative solutions and limits of a 1 + 2 dimensional Fokker-Planck equation. 
The central finding is that, under conditions of a more-or-less constant 
population voltage variance, the firing-rate response is only weakly dependent 
on the fluctuation filter constant: The voltage distribution is the principal 
determinant of the population response. This result is unexpected given the 
nature of the systems underlying the extreme limits of fast and frozen 
fluctuations; the first limit represents a homogeneous population of neurons 
firing stochastically, whereas the second limit is equivalent to a heterogeneous 
population of neurons firing deterministically.}, institution = {Mathematics

retrieval probabilities as a function of pattern age for networks with binary 
neurons and synapses updated with the simple Hebbian learning model studied in 
Amit and Fusi ( 1994 ). The analysis depends on choosing a neural threshold that 
enables patterns to stabilize in the neural dynamics. In contrast to most 
earlier work, where selective neurons for each pattern are drawn independently 
with fixed probability f, here we analyze the situation where f is drawn from 
some distribution on a range of coding levels. In order to set a workable 
threshold in this setting, it is necessary to introduce a simple inhibition in 
the neural dynamics whose magnitude depends on the total activity of the 
network. Proper choice of the threshold depends on the value of the covariances 
between the synapses for which we provide an explicit formula. Retrieval 
probabilities depend on the distribution of the fields induced by a learned 
pattern. We show that the field induced by the first learned pattern evolves as 
a Markov chain during subsequent learning epochs, leading to a recursive formula 
for the distribution. Alternatively, the distribution can be computed using a 
normal approximation, which involves the value of the synaptic covariances. 
Capacity is computed as the sum of the retrieval probabilities over all ages. We 
show through simulation that the chosen threshold enables retrieval with 
asynchronous dynamics even in the presence of significant noise in the initial 
state of the pattern. The computed probabilities with both methods are shown to 
be very close to probabilities estimated from simulation. The analysis is 
extended to randomly connected networks.}, bdsk-url-1  =

Cerebellar long-term depression (LTD) is a form of synaptic plasticity expressed 
as a reduction in the number of synaptic AMPA receptors (AMPARs) in Purkinje 
cells. We developed a stochastic model of the LTD signaling network, including a 
PKC-ERK-cPLA(2) positive feedback loop and mechanisms of AMPAR trafficking, and 
tuned the model to replicate calcium uncaging experiments. The signaling network 
activity in single synapses switches between two discrete stable states (LTD and 
non-LTD) in a probabilistic manner. The stochasticity of the signaling network 
causes threshold dithering and allows at the macroscopic level for many 
different and stable mean magnitudes of depression. The probability of LTD 
occurrence in a single spine is only modulated by the concentration and duration 
of the signal used to trigger it, and inputs with the same magnitude can give 
rise to two different responses; there is no threshold for the input signal. The 
stochasticity is intrinsic to the signaling network and not mostly dependent on 
noise in the calcium input signal, as has been suggested previously. The 
activities of the ultrasensitive ERK and of cPLA(2) undergo strong stochastic 
fluctuations. Conversely, PKC, which acts as a noise filter, is more constantly 
activated. Systematic variation of the biochemical population size demonstrates 
that threshold dithering and the absence of spontaneous LTD depend critically on 
the number of molecules in a spine, indicating constraints on spine size in 
Purkinje cells.}, bdsk-url-1  =

  Abstract                 = {The pFC is critical for cognitive flexibility 
(i.e., our ability to flexibly adjust behavior to changing environmental 
demands), but also for cognitive stability (i.e., our ability to follow 
behavioral plans in the face of distraction). Behavioral research suggests that 
individuals differ in their cognitive flexibility and stability, and 
neurocomputational theories of working memory relate this variability to the 
concept of attractor stability in recurrently connected neural networks. We 
introduce a novel task paradigm to simultaneously assess flexible switching 
between task rules (cognitive flexibility) and task performance in the presence 
of irrelevant distractors (cognitive stability) and to furthermore assess the 
individual "spontaneous switching rate" in response to ambiguous stimuli to 
quantify the individual dispositional cognitive flexibility in a theoretically 
motivated way (i.e., as a proxy for attractor stability). Using fMRI in healthy 
human participants, a common network consisting of parietal and frontal areas 
was found for task switching and distractor inhibition. More flexible persons 
showed reduced activation and reduced functional coupling in frontal areas, 
including the inferior frontal junction, during task switching. Most 
importantly, the individual spontaneous switching rate antagonistically affected 
the functional coupling between inferior frontal junction and the superior 
frontal gyrus during task switching and distractor inhibition, respectively, 
indicating that individual differences in cognitive flexibility and stability 
are indeed related to a common prefrontal neural mechanism. We suggest that the 
concept of attractor stability of prefrontal working memory networks is a 
meaningful model for individual differences in cognitive stability versus 
flexibility.}, Citation-subset          = {IM}, Completed                =

  abstract             = {The mammalian hippocampus is crucial for episodic 
memory formation and transiently retains information for about 3-4 weeks in 
adult mice and longer in humans. Although neuroscientists widely believe that 
neural synapses are elemental sites of information storage, there has been no 
direct evidence that hippocampal synapses persist for time intervals 
commensurate with the duration of hippocampal-dependent memory. Here we tested 
the prediction that the lifetimes of hippocampal synapses match the longevity of 
hippocampal memory. By using time-lapse two-photon microendoscopy in the CA1 
hippocampal area of live mice, we monitored the turnover dynamics of the 
pyramidal neurons' basal dendritic spines, postsynaptic structures whose 
turnover dynamics are thought to reflect those of excitatory synaptic 
connections. Strikingly, CA1 spine turnover dynamics differed sharply from those 
seen previously in the neocortex. Mathematical modelling revealed that the data 
best matched kinetic models with a single population of spines with a mean 
lifetime of approximately 1-2 weeks. This implies â¼100% turnover in â¼2-3 
times this interval, a near full erasure of the synaptic connectivity pattern. 
Although N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blockade stabilizes spines in the 
neocortex, in CA1 it transiently increased the rate of spine loss and thus 
lowered spine density. These results reveal that adult neocortical and 
hippocampal pyramidal neurons have divergent patterns of spine regulation and 
quantitatively support the idea that the transience of hippocampal-dependent 
memory directly reflects the turnover dynamics of hippocampal synapses.},

  Abstract                 = {During development of neuronal circuits, 
presynaptic and postsynaptic functions are adjusted in concert, to optimize 
interneuronal signaling. We have investigated whether activation of glutamate 
receptors affects presynaptic function during synapse formation, when 
constitutive synaptic vesicle recycling is downregulated. Using primary cultures 
of hippocampal neurons as a model system, we have found that chronic exposure to 
both NMDA and non-NMDA glutamate receptor blockers during synaptogenesis 
produces an increase in miniature EPSC (mEPSC) frequency, with no significant 
changes in mEPSC amplitude or in the number of synapses. Enhanced synaptic 
vesicle recycling, selectively in glutamatergic nerve terminals, was confirmed 
by the increased uptake of antibodies directed against the lumenal domain of 
synaptotagmin. No increased uptake was detected in neuronal cultures grown in 
the chronic presence of TTX, speaking against an indirect effect caused by 
decreased electrical activity. Enhanced mEPSC frequency correlated with a 
reduction of synaptophysin-synaptobrevin-vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 
(VAMP2) complexes detectable by immunoprecipitation. Intracellular perfusion 
with a peptide that inhibits the binding of synaptophysin to synaptobrevin-VAMP2 
induced a remarkable increase of mEPSC frequency in control but not in glutamate 
receptor blocker-treated neurons. These findings suggest that activation of 
glutamate receptors plays a role in the downregulation of the basal rate of 
synaptic vesicle recycling that accompanies synapse formation. They also suggest 
that one of the mechanisms through which this downregulation is achieved is an 
increased interaction of synaptophysin with synaptobrevin-VAMP2.}, Institution

for the efficient experimental generation of reduced neuron models. The method 
extracts the response properties of a neuron while it is subject to a 
naturalistic stimulus that mimics in vivo-like fluctuating synaptic drive. The 
resulting history-dependent, transmembrane current is then projected onto a 
one-dimensional current-voltage relation that provides the basis for a tractable 
non-linear integrate-and-fire model. An attractive feature of the method is that 
it can be used in spike-triggered mode to quantify the distinct patterns of 
post-spike refractoriness seen in different classes of cortical neuron. The 
method is first illustrated using a conductance-based model and is then applied

intracellular measurements of current-voltage (I-V) relationships during 
application of current or voltage steps. Here we demonstrate the measurement of 
a novel I-V curve measured while the neuron exhibits a fluctuating voltage and 
emits spikes. This dynamic I-V curve requires only a few tens of seconds of 
experimental time and so lends itself readily to the rapid classification of 
cell type, quantification of heterogeneities in cell populations, and generation 
of reduced analytical models. We apply this technique to layer-5 pyramidal cells 
and show that their dynamic I-V curve comprises linear and exponential 
components, providing experimental evidence for a recently proposed theoretical 
model. The approach also allows us to determine the change of neuronal response 
properties after a spike, millisecond by millisecond, so that postspike 
refractoriness of pyramidal cells can be quantified. Observations of I-V curves 
during and in absence of refractoriness are cast into a model that is used to 
predict both the subthreshold response and spiking activity of the neuron to 
novel stimuli. The predictions of the resulting model are in excellent agreement 
with experimental data and close to the intrinsic neuronal reproducibility to 
repeated stimuli.}, bdsk-url-1  = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/jn.01107.2007}, doi

higher areas. We measured adaptation of spiking activity and local field 
potentials (LFPs) in macaque inferior temporal (IT) cortex for parameterized

predictions derived from different models of adaptation. Adaptation was similar 
during passive fixation or an attention-demanding task. We found consistent 
adaptation of spiking activity and LFP power in high- (gamma) but not 
low-frequency bands when repeating shapes. Contrary to sharpening models, 
repetition did not affect shape selectivity. The degree of similarity between 
adapter and test shapes was a stronger determinant of adaptation than was the 
response to the adapter. Adaptation still occurred when adapter and test stimuli 
did not spatially overlap, but adaptation was stronger for same, compared with 
different, adapters and test stimulus positions. These adaptation effects were 
similar for spiking and for gamma activity. In conclusion, adaptation of IT 
spiking activity and LFPs in IT is strongly dependent on feature similarities in

gradient limit, (3) low-pass spatial filtering by mechanisms early in the visual

experimental results reveal the contributions of the first three factors. A 
theoretical analysis of binocular matching by interocular correlation reveals 
the contribution of the fourth: the highest attainable stereoresolution may be 
limited by (1) the smallest useful correlation window in the visual system, and 
(2) a matching process that estimates the disparity of image patches and assumes 
that disparity is constant across the patch. Both properties are observed in 
disparity-selective neurons in area V1 of the primate (Nienborg et al., 2004).},

adaptation, often results in an adaptation "aftereffect" which can profoundly 
distort our perception of subsequent visual stimuli. This technique has been 
commonly used to investigate mechanisms underlying our perception of simple 
visual stimuli, and more recently, of static faces. We tested whether humans 
would adapt to movies of hands grasping and placing different weight objects. 
After adapting to hands grasping light or heavy objects, subsequently perceived 
objects appeared relatively heavier, or lighter, respectively. The aftereffects 
increased logarithmically with adaptation action repetition and decayed 
logarithmically with time. Adaptation aftereffects also indicated that 
perception of actions relies predominantly on view-dependent mechanisms. 
Adapting to one action significantly influenced the perception of the opposite 
action. These aftereffects can only be explained by adaptation of mechanisms 
that take into account the presence/absence of the object in the hand. We tested 
if evidence on action processing mechanisms obtained using visual adaptation 
techniques confirms underlying neural processing. We recorded monkey superior 
temporal sulcus (STS) single-cell responses to hand actions. Cells sensitive to 
grasping or placing typically responded well to the opposite action; cells also 
responded during different phases of the actions. Cell responses were sensitive 
to the view of the action and were dependent upon the presence of the object in 
the scene. We show here that action processing mechanisms established using 
visual adaptation parallel the neural mechanisms revealed during recording from 
monkey STS. Visual adaptation techniques can thus be usefully employed to 
investigate brain mechanisms underlying action perception.}, bdsk-url-1  =

within forward and backward walking sequences. We found that 57\% of cells that 
responded to the static image of a human figure was also sensitive to the degree 
of articulation of the figure. Some cells displayed selective responses for 
articulated postures, while others (in equal numbers) displayed selective 
responses for standing postures. Cells selective for static images of 
articulated figures were more likely to respond to movies of walking forwards 
than walking backwards. Cells selective for static images of standing figures 
were more likely to respond to movies of walking backwards than forwards. An 
association between form sensitivity and walking sensitivity could be consistent

  Abstract                 = {Mutual synaptic interactions between GABAergic 
interneurons are thought to be of critical importance for the generation of 
network oscillations and for temporal encoding of information in the 
hippocampus. However, the functional properties of synaptic transmission between 
hippocampal interneurons are largely unknown. We have made paired recordings 
from basket cells (BCs) in the dentate gyrus of rat hippocampal slices, followed 
by correlated light and electron microscopical analysis. Unitary GABA(A) 
receptor-mediated IPSCs at BC-BC synapses recorded at the soma showed a fast 
rise and decay, with a mean decay time constant of 2.5 +/- 0.2 msec (32 degrees 
C). Synaptic transmission at BC-BC synapses showed paired-pulse depression (PPD) 
(32 +/- 5\% for 10 msec interpulse intervals) and multiple-pulse depression 
during repetitive stimulation. Detailed passive cable model simulations based on 
somatodendritic morphology and localization of synaptic contacts further 
indicated that the conductance change at the postsynaptic site was even faster, 
decaying with a mean time constant of 1.8 +/- 0.6 msec. Sequential triple 
recordings revealed that the decay time course of IPSCs at BC-BC synapses was 
approximately twofold faster than that at BC-granule cell synapses, whereas the 
extent of PPD was comparable. To examine the consequences of the fast 
postsynaptic conductance change for the generation of oscillatory activity, we 
developed a computational model of an interneuron network. The model showed 
robust oscillations at frequencies >60 Hz if the excitatory drive was 
sufficiently large. Thus the fast conductance change at interneuron-interneuron 
synapses may promote the generation of high-frequency oscillations observed in 
the dentate gyrus in vivo.}, Institution              = {Physiologisches

  Abstract                 = {Perception is fundamentally underconstrained 
because different combinations of object properties can generate the same 
sensory information. To disambiguate sensory information into estimates of scene 
properties, our brains incorporate prior knowledge and additional "auxiliary" 
(i.e., not directly relevant to desired scene property) sensory information to 
constrain perceptual interpretations. For example, knowing the distance to an 
object helps in perceiving its size. The literature contains few demonstrations 
of the use of prior knowledge and auxiliary information in combined visual and 
haptic disambiguation and almost no examination of haptic disambiguation of 
vision beyond "bistable" stimuli. Previous studies have reported humans 
integrate multiple unambiguous sensations to perceive single, continuous object 
properties, like size or position. Here we test whether humans use visual and 
haptic information, individually and jointly, to disambiguate size from 
distance. We presented participants with a ball moving in depth with a changing 
diameter. Because no unambiguous distance information is available under 
monocular viewing, participants rely on prior assumptions about the ball's 
distance to disambiguate their -size percept. Presenting auxiliary binocular 
and/or haptic distance information augments participants' prior distance 
assumptions and improves their size judgment accuracy-though binocular cues were 
trusted more than haptic. Our results suggest both visual and haptic distance 
information disambiguate size perception, and we interpret these results in the 
context of probabilistic perceptual reasoning.}, Citation-subset          =

(1980) and Mishkin (1982) have shown that lesions to the inferior temporal 
visual cortex can impair the performance of serial visual recognition memory 
tasks. In order to provide evidence on whether the inferior temporal visual 
cortex contains a mechanism which enables memory to span the intervening items 
in a serial recognition task, or whether the inferior temporal cortex is merely 
afferent to such recent memory mechanisms, we analysed the activity of single 
neurons in the inferior temporal visual cortex and the adjacent cortex in the 
superior temporal sulcus in both delayed match to sample and serial recognition 
memory tasks. In the serial recognition task, various numbers of stimuli 
intervened between the first and second presentations of a stimulus. A 
considerable proportion (64/264 or 26\%) of visually responsive inferotemporal 
neurons showed a different response to the "novel" and "familiar" presentations 
of a stimulus in the serial recognition memory task, and often a corresponding 
difference in response between the sample and match presentations of a stimulus 
in the delayed match to sample task. For the majority of neurons this difference 
was not sustained across even one intervening stimulus in the serial recognition 
task, and no neurons bridged more than 2 intervening stimuli. These results show 
that neurons in the inferior temporal cortex have responses which would be 
useful for a short term visual memory for stimuli, but would not be useful in 
recency memory tasks in which more than one stimulus intervenes between the 
first and second presentations of a stimulus. In this investigation, neurons 
were recorded both in the cortex on the inferior temporal gyrus (commonly called 
inferior temporal visual cortex, and consisting of areas TE3, TE2 and TE1 of 
Seltzer and Pandya 1978), and in the cortex in the adjacent anterior part of the 
superior temporal sulcus, in which a number of different temporal cortical 
visual areas have now been described.}, keywords  = {Animals; Discrimination

Independent Components Analysis or ICA, for sparse (super-gaussian) component

  Abstract                 = {In the immature brain, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric 
acid) is excitatory, and GABA-releasing synapses are formed before glutamatergic 
contacts in a wide range of species and structures. GABA becomes inhibitory by 
the delayed expression of a chloride exporter, leading to a negative shift in 
the reversal potential for choride ions. I propose that this mechanism provides 
a solution to the problem of how to excite developing neurons to promote growth 
and synapse formation while avoiding the potentially toxic effects of a mismatch 
between GABA-mediated inhibition and glutamatergic excitation. As key elements 
of this cascade are activity dependent, the formation of inhibition adds an 
element of nurture to the construction of cortical networks.}, Bdsk-url-1

pyramidal neurons reorganized their phase, concentrating at hippocampal theta

result from increased inhibition exerted by interneurons on pyramidal cells, as 
measured by cross-correlation, and could be modulated by dopamine: we found 
similar hippocampal-Pfc theta coherence increases and neuronal phase shifts 
following local administration of dopamine in Pfc of anesthetized rats. Pfc cell 
assemblies emerging during high coherence were preferentially replayed during 
subsequent sleep, concurrent with hippocampal sharp waves. Thus, 
hippocampal/prefrontal coherence could lead to synchronization of reward

  = {2523--2564}, abstract    = {Spike-frequency adaptation is a prominent 
feature of neural dynamics. Among other mechanisms, various ionic currents 
modulating spike generation cause this type of neural adaptation. Prominent 
examples are voltage-gated potassium currents (M-type currents), the interplay 
of calcium currents and intracellular calcium dynamics with calcium-gated 
potassium channels (AHP-type currents), and the slow recovery from inactivation 
of the fast sodium current. While recent modeling studies have focused on the 
effects of specific adaptation currents, we derive a universal model for the 
firing-frequency dynamics of an adapting neuron that is independent of the 
specific adaptation process and spike generator. The model is completely defined 
by the neuron's onset f-I curve, the steady-state f-I curve, and the time 
constant of adaptation. For a specific neuron, these parameters can be easily 
determined from electrophysiological measurements without any pharmacological 
manipulations. At the same time, the simplicity of the model allows one to 
analyze mathematically how adaptation influences signal processing on the 
single-neuron level. In particular, we elucidate the specific nature of 
high-pass filter properties caused by spike-frequency adaptation. The model is 
limited to firing frequencies higher than the reciprocal adaptation time 
constant and to moderate fluctuations of the adaptation and the input current. 
As an extension of the model, we introduce a framework for combining an 
arbitrary spike generator with a generalized adaptation current.}, bdsk-url-1  =

molecular properties of synaptic 
alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) receptors are an 
important factor determining excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain. 
Changes in the number (N) or single-channel conductance (gamma) of functional 
AMPA receptors may underlie synaptic plasticity, such as long-term potentiation 
(LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). These parameters have been estimated using 
non-stationary fluctuation analysis (NSFA). 2. The validity of NSFA for studying 
the channel properties of synaptic AMPA receptors was assessed using a cable 
model with dendritic spines and a microscopic kinetic description of AMPA 
receptors. Electrotonic, geometric and kinetic parameters were altered in order 
to determine their effects on estimates of the underlying gamma. 3. Estimates of 
gamma were very sensitive to the access resistance of the recording (R(A)) and 
the mean open time of AMPA channels. Estimates of gamma were less sensitive to 
the distance between the electrode and the synaptic site, the electrotonic 
properties of dendritic structures, recording electrode capacitance and 
background noise. Estimates of gamma were insensitive to changes in spine 
morphology, synaptic glutamate concentration and the peak open probability 
(P(o)) of AMPA receptors. 4. The results obtained using the model agree with 
biological data, obtained from 91 dendritic recordings from rat CA1 pyramidal 
cells. A correlation analysis showed that R(A) resulted in a slowing of the 
decay time constant of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) by approximately 
150 \%, from an estimated value of 3.1 ms. R(A) also greatly attenuated the 
absolute estimate of gamma by approximately 50-70 \%. 5. When other parameters 
remain constant, the model demonstrates that NSFA of dendritic recordings can 
readily discriminate between changes in gamma vs. changes in N or P(o). Neither 
background noise nor asynchronous activation of multiple synapses prevented 
reliable discrimination between changes in gamma and changes in either N or 
P(o). 6. The model (available online) can be used to predict how changes in the 
different properties of AMPA receptors may influence synaptic transmission and 
plasticity.}, institution = {MRC Centre for Synaptic Plasticity, Department of

few dozen milliseconds with each neuron emitting only a few spikes. Under these

as the most commonly used theoretical tool--Fisher information--can lead to 
erroneous conclusions about the optimality of different coding schemes. Here we 
revisit the effect of tuning function width and correlation structure on neural 
population codes based on ideal observer analysis in both a discrimination and a 
reconstruction task. We show that the optimal tuning function width and the 
optimal correlation structure in both paradigms strongly depend on the available 
decoding time in a very similar way. In contrast, population codes optimized for 
Fisher information do not depend on decoding time and are severely suboptimal 
when only few spikes are available. In addition, we use the neurometric 
functions of the ideal observer in the classification task to investigate the 
differential coding properties of these Fisher-optimal codes for fine and coarse 
discrimination. We find that the discrimination error for these codes does not 
decrease to zero with increasing population size, even in simple coarse 
discrimination tasks. Our results suggest that quite different population codes 
may be optimal for rapid decoding in cortical computations than those inferred 
from the optimization of Fisher information.}, bdsk-url-1  =

computational units can show very different types of dynamics, ranging from 
totally ordered to chaotic. We analyze how the type of dynamics (ordered or 
chaotic) exhibited by randomly connected networks of threshold gates driven by a 
time-varying input signal depends on the parameters describing the distribution 
of the connectivity matrix. In particular, we calculate the critical boundary in 
parameter space where the transition from ordered to chaotic dynamics takes 
place. Employing a recently developed framework for analyzing real-time 
computations, we show that only near the critical boundary can such networks 
perform complex computations on time series. Hence, this result strongly 
supports conjectures that dynamical systems that are capable of doing complex 
computational tasks should operate near the edge of chaos, that is, the 
transition from ordered to chaotic dynamics.}, bdsk-url-1  =

abstract    = {Cellular studies have focused on long-term potentiation (LTP) and 
long-term depression (LTD) to understand requirements for persistent changes in 
synaptic connections. Whereas LTP is induced through high-frequency intermittent 
stimulation, low-frequency stimulation evokes LTD. Because of the ubiquitous 
efficacy of these protocols, they are considered fundamental mechanisms 
underlying learning. Here we adapted LTP/LTD-like protocols to visual 
stimulation to alter human visually guided behavior. In a change-detection task, 
participants reported luminance changes against distracting orientation changes. 
Subsequently, they were exposed to passive visual high- or low-frequency 
stimulation of either the relevant luminance or irrelevant orientation feature. 
LTP-like high-frequency protocols using luminance improved ability to detect 
luminance changes, whereas low-frequency LTD-like stimulation impaired 
performance. In contrast, LTP-like exposure of the irrelevant orientation 
feature impaired performance, whereas LTD-like orientation stimulation improved 
it. LTP-like effects were present for 10 days, whereas LTD-like effects lasted 
for a shorter period of time. Our data demonstrate that instead of electrically 
stimulating synapses, selective behavioral changes are evoked in humans by using 
equivalently timed visual stimulation, suggesting that both LTD- and LTP-like 
protocols control human behavior but that the direction of changes is determined 
by the feature incorporated into the stimulation protocol.}, bdsk-url-1  =

clarity, given that we so far lack a comprehensive theory of frontal function. 
Pending a more complete mechanistic understanding, clinically useful 
generalizations can help characterize both healthy cognition and multiple 
varieties of cognitive impairment. This article surveys several hierarchical and 
autoregulatory control theories, and suggests that the evolutionary 
cytoarchitectonic trends theory provides a valuable neuroanatomical framework to 
help organize research on frontal structure-function relations. The theory 
suggests that paleocortical/ventrolateral and archicortical/dorsomedial trends 
are associated with neural network flexibility and stability respectively, which 
comports well with multiple other conceptual distinctions that have been 
proposed to characterize ventral and dorsal frontal functions, including the 
"initiation/inhibition," "what/where," and "classification/expectation" 
hypotheses.},

should be plastic to allow for learning; however, they should also retain 
earlier memories. Here we explore how synaptic weights and memories are retained 
in models of single neurons and networks equipped with spike-timing-dependent 
plasticity. We show that for single neuron models, the precise learning rule has 
a strong effect on the memory retention time. In particular, a soft-bound, 
weight-dependent learning rule has a very short retention time as compared with 
a learning rule that is independent of the synaptic weights. Next, we explore 
how the retention time is reflected in receptive field stability in networks. As 
in the single neuron case, the weight-dependent learning rule yields less stable 
receptive fields than a weight-independent rule. However, receptive fields 
stabilize in the presence of sufficient lateral inhibition, demonstrating that 
plasticity in networks can be regulated by inhibition and suggesting a novel 
role for inhibition in neural circuits.}, bdsk-url-1  =

abstract    = {Much evidence indicates that the perirhinal cortex is involved in 
the familiarity discrimination aspect of recognition memory. It has been 
previously shown under selective conditions that neural networks performing 
familiarity discrimination can achieve very high storage capacity, being able to 
deal with many times more stimuli than associative memory networks can in 
associative recall. The capacity of associative memories for recall has been 
shown to be highly dependent on the sparseness of coding. However, previous work 
on the networks of Bogacz et al, Norman and O'Reilly and Sohal and Hasselmo that 
model familiarity discrimination in the perirhinal cortex has not investigated 
the effects of the sparseness of encoding on capacity. This paper explores how 
sparseness of coding influences the capacity of each of these published models 
and establishes that sparse coding influences the capacity of the different 
models in different ways. The capacity of the Bogacz et al model can be made 
independent of the sparseness of coding. Capacity increases as coding becomes 
sparser for a simplified version of the neocortical part of the Norman and 
O'Reilly model, whereas capacity decreases as coding becomes sparser for a 
simplified version of the Sohal and Hasselmo model. Thus in general, and in 
contrast to associative memory networks, sparse encoding results in little or no 
advantage for the capacity of familiarity discrimination networks. Hence it may 
be less important for coding to be sparse in the perirhinal cortex than it is in 
the hippocampus. Additionally, it is established that the capacities of the 
networks are strongly dependent on the precise form of the learning rules 
(synaptic plasticity) used in the network. This finding indicates that the 
precise characteristics of synaptic plastic changes in the real brain are likely 
to have major influences on storage capacity.}, institution = {Department of

fields such that every point in space is covered by three to four cells. We 
investigated what function is served by such extensive overlap. Recording from 
pairs of ON or OFF brisk-transient ganglion cells at photopic intensities, we 
confirmed that this overlap causes the Gaussian receptive field centers to be 
spaced at approximately 2 SDs (sigma). This, together with response 
nonlinearities and variability, was just sufficient to provide an ideal observer 
with uniform contrast sensitivity across the retina for both threshold and 
suprathreshold stimuli. We hypothesized that overlap might maximize the 
information represented from natural images, thereby optimizing retinal 
performance for many tasks. Indeed, tested with natural images (which contain 
statistical correlations), a model ganglion cell array maximized information 
represented in its population responses with approximately 2sigma spacing, i.e., 
the overlap observed in the retina. Yet, tested with white noise (which lacks 
statistical correlations), an array maximized its information by minimizing 
overlap. In both cases, optimal overlap balanced greater signal-to-noise ratio 
(from larger receptive fields) against greater redundancy (because of larger 
receptive field overlap). Thus, dendritic overlap improves vision by taking 
optimal advantage of the statistical correlations of natural scenes.},

  Abstract                 = {1. The calcium current of a 'giant' synaptic 
terminal (the calyx of Held) was studied using two-electrode voltage clamp in 
slices of the rat brainstem. 2. In terminals with a long axon (length > 100 
microns), the passive current transient decayed biexponentially following 
voltage steps. In terminals with a short axon (length < 30 microns), the slow 
component was reduced or absent. These terminals also had small slow calcium 
tail currents following long depolarizing voltage steps, suggesting that these 
are largely due to axonal calcium channels. 3. Terminals were voltage clamped 
with action potential waveform commands. At both 24 and 36 degrees C the calcium 
current began shortly after the peak of the action potential and ended before 
the terminal was fully repolarized. 4. The calcium current during the 
repolarization phase was 69 +/- 1\% (n = 3) of maximal, judged from the increase 
in this current when a plateau phase was added to the action potential waveform. 
5. A Hodgkin-Huxley m2 model, based on the measured activation and deactivation 
of the calcium current, reproduced both the time course and the amplitude 
increase of the calcium currents during the different action potential waveforms 
well. 6. The fast gating of the calcium channels in the terminal ensures that 
they are effectively opened during the repolarization phase of an action 
potential. This implies that the distance between open calcium channels is 
minimized, which is in agreement with the view that multiple calcium channels 
are needed to release a vesicle in this synapse.}, Institution              =

different regions of parameter space. Comparisons of linear fits to V/M against 
M plots and of parameter estimates indicated that these differences were

transparency provides a challenging test case for our understanding of how 
visual motion, and other attributes, are computed and represented in the brain. 
However, previous studies of visual transparency have used subjective criteria 
which do not confirm the existence of independent representations of the 
superimposed motions. We have developed measures of performance in motion 
transparency that require observers to extract information about two motions 
jointly, and therefore test the information that is simultaneously represented 
for each motion. Observers judged whether two motions were at 90 degrees to one 
another; the base direction was randomized so that neither motion taken alone 
was informative. The precision of performance was determined by the standard 
deviations (S.D.s) of probit functions fitted to the data. Observers also made 
judgments of orthogonal directions between a single motion stream and a line, 
for one of two transparent motions against a line and for two spatially 
segregated motions. The data show that direction judgments with transparency can 
be made with comparable accuracy to segregated (non-transparent) conditions, 
supporting the idea that transparency involves the equivalent representation of 
two global motions in the same region. The precision of this joint direction 
judgment is, however, 2-3 times poorer than that for a single motion stream. The 
precision in directional judgment for a single stream is reduced only by a 
factor of about 1.5 by superimposing a second stream. The major effect in 
performance, therefore, appears to be associated with the need to compute and 
compare two global representations of motion, rather than with interference 
between the dot streams per se. Experiment 2 tested the transparency of motions 
separated by a range of angles from 5 degrees to 180 degrees by requiring 
subjects to set a line matching the perceived direction of each motion. The 
S.D.s of these settings demonstrated that directions of transparent motions were 
represented independently for separations over 20 degrees. Increasing dot speeds 
from 1 to 10 deg/s improved directional performance but had no effect on 
transparency perception. Transparency was also unaffected by variations of 
density between 0.1 and 19 dots/deg(2)}, institution = {Department of

modulation frequency. Such functions have proved to be useful descriptive and 
analytical tools in the study of the mechanisms involved in disparity

be used to predict certain perceptual outcomes. Given their importance, it is 
surprising that there is no comprehensive data set of disparity sensitivity 
functions (DSF) for a range of observers over a broad range of spatial 
frequencies and orientations. Here we report DSFs for six observers over an 
eight octave range of sinusoidal corrugations in disparity (0.0125-3.2 cpd). 
Multi-cycle, low frequency surfaces were used to assess the degree to which the 
fall-off in sensitivity at low corrugation frequencies is attributable to the 
decreasing number of cycles displayed. The data was found to form a continuous 
function despite the different number of cycles displayed. We conclude that the 
fall off in sensitivity is due to the spatial interactions in disparity 
processing. We also determined DSFs for the same observers to both vertically 
and horizontally oriented sinusoidal disparity corrugations in order to 
characterise the extent of the stereoscopic anisotropy. In general, the best 
thresholds for detecting vertically oriented disparity corrugations were higher 
(approximately 4 arc sec) than for horizontally oriented corrugations 
(approximately 2 arc sec). Moreover, the functions were shifted toward the high

gain control mechanism in the cortical coding of contrast whereby the response

While restricted in space, the normalisation pool is broadly tuned for spatial 
frequency and orientation, so that a cell's response is adapted by stimuli which 
fall outside its 'classical' receptive field. Various functions have been 
attributed to divisive gain control: in this paper we consider whether this 
output nonlinearity serves to increase the information carrying capacity of the 
neural code. 46 natural scenes were analysed with the use of oriented, 
frequency-tuned filters whose bandwidths were chosen to match those of mammalian 
striate cortical cells. The images were logarithmically transformed so that the 
filters responded to a luminance ratio or contrast. In the first study, the 
response of each filter was calibrated relative to its response to a grating 
stimulus, and local image contrast was expressed in terms of the familiar 
Michelson metric. We found that the distribution of contrasts in natural images 
is highly kurtotic, peaking at low values and having a long exponential tail. 
There is considerable variability in local contrast, both within and between 
images. In the second study we compared the distribution of response activity 
before and after implementing contrast normalisation, and noted two major 
changes. Response variability, both within and between scenes, is reduced by 
normalisation, and the entropy of the response distribution is increased after 
normalisation, indicating a more efficient transfer of information.},

hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). However, no obvious impairment of 
excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission was found, suggesting a complex 
cause for the LTP defect. Detailed behavioral analysis revealed no statistically 
significant deficits in learning and memory. These data indicate that brevican 
is not crucial for brain development but has restricted structural and 
functional roles.},

  Abstract                 = {Comput. neuroscience relies heavily on the 
simulation of large networks of neuron models. There are essentially two 
simulation strategies: (1) using an approximation method (e.g., Runge-Kutta) 
with spike times binned to the time step and (2) calculating spike times exactly 
in an event-driven fashion. In large networks, the computation time of the best 
algorithm for either strategy scales linearly with the number of synapses, but 
each strategy has its own assets and constraints: approximation methods can be 
applied to any model but are inexact; exact simulation avoids numerical 
artifacts but is limited to simple models. Previous work has focused on 
improving the accuracy of approximation methods. In this article, we extend the 
range of models that can be simulated exactly to a more realistic model: an 
integrate-and-fire model with exponential synaptic conductances.}, Bdsk-url-1

with current-based or conductance-based synapses, using clock-driven or 
event-driven integration strategies. The same set of models are implemented on

this review is to provide a resource to facilitate identifying the appropriate

synaptic currents is relatively low, the spillover of synaptically released GABA 
(gamma-aminobutyric acid) gives rise to a persistent conductance mediated by the 
GABA A receptor that also modifies the excitability of granule cells. Here we 
show that this tonic conductance is absent in granule cells that lack the alpha6 
and delta-subunits of the GABAA receptor. The response of these granule cells to 
excitatory synaptic input remains unaltered, owing to an increase in a 'leak' 
conductance, which is present at rest, with properties characteristic of the 
two-pore-domain K+ channel TASK-1 (refs 9,10,11,12). Our results highlight the 
importance of tonic inhibition mediated by GABAA receptors, loss of which 
triggers a form of homeostatic plasticity leading to a change in the magnitude

projects to the primate cerebral cortex by way of the pulvinar, previous studies 
have failed to find any physiological evidence that the superior colliculus 
influences visual activity in the cortex. We studied the relative contributions 
of the tectofugal and geniculostriate systems to the visual properties of 
neurons in the superior temporal polysensory area (STP) by comparing the effects 
of unilateral removal of striate cortex, the superior colliculus, or of both 
structures. In the intact monkey, STP neurons have large, bilateral receptive 
fields. Complete unilateral removal of striate cortex did not eliminate visual 
responses of STP neurons in the contralateral visual hemifield; rather, nearly 
half the cells still responded to visual stimuli in the hemifield contralateral 
to the lesion. Thus the visual properties of STP neurons are not completely 
dependent on the geniculostriate system. Unilateral striate lesions did affect 
the response properties of STP neurons in three ways. Whereas most STP neurons 
in the intact monkey respond similarly to stimuli in the two visual hemifields, 
responses to stimuli in the hemifield contralateral to the striate lesion were 
usually weaker than responses in the ipsilateral hemifield. Whereas the 
responses of many STP neurons in the intact monkey were selective for the 
direction of stimulus motion or for stimulus form, responses in the hemifield 
contralateral to the striate lesion were not selective for either motion or 
form. Whereas the median receptive field in the intact monkey extended 80 
degrees into the contralateral visual field, the receptive fields of cells with 
responses in the contralateral field that survived the striate lesions had a 
median border that extended only 50 degrees into the contralateral visual field. 
Removal of both striate cortex and the superior colliculus in the same 
hemisphere abolished the responses of STP neurons to visual stimuli in the 
hemifield contralateral to the combined lesion. Nearly 80\% of the cells still 
responded to visual stimuli in the hemifield ipsilateral to the lesion. 
Unilateral removal of the superior colliculus alone had only small effects on 
visual responses in STP. Receptive-field size and visual response strength were 
slightly reduced in the hemifield contralateral to the collicular lesion. As in 
the intact monkey, selectivity for stimulus motion or form were similar in the 
two visual hemifields. We conclude that both striate cortex and the superior 
colliculus contribute to the visual responses of STP neurons. Striate cortex is 
crucial for the movement and stimulus specificity of neurons in STP.(ABSTRACT

  abstract    = {When the local field potential of a cortical 
network displays coherent fast oscillations ( approximately 40-Hz gamma or 
approximately 200-Hz sharp-wave ripples), the spike trains of constituent 
neurons are typically irregular and sparse. The dichotomy between rhythmic local 
field and stochastic spike trains presents a challenge to the theory of brain 
rhythms in the framework of coupled oscillators. Previous studies have shown 
that when noise is large and recurrent inhibition is strong, a coherent network 
rhythm can be generated while single neurons fire intermittently at low rates 
compared to the frequency of the oscillation. However, these studies used too 
simplified synaptic kinetics to allow quantitative predictions of the population 
rhythmic frequency. Here we show how to derive quantitatively the coherent 
oscillation frequency for a randomly connected network of leaky 
integrate-and-fire neurons with realistic synaptic parameters. In a 
noise-dominated interneuronal network, the oscillation frequency depends much 
more on the shortest synaptic time constants (delay and rise time) than on the 
longer synaptic decay time, and approximately 200-Hz frequency can be realized 
with synaptic time constants taken from slice data. In a network composed of 
both interneurons and excitatory cells, the rhythmogenesis is a compromise 
between two scenarios: the fast purely interneuronal mechanism, and the slower 
feedback mechanism (relying on the excitatory-inhibitory loop). The properties 
of the rhythm are determined essentially by the ratio of time scales of 
excitatory and inhibitory currents and by the balance between the mean recurrent 
excitation and inhibition. Faster excitation than inhibition, or a higher 
excitation/inhibition ratio, favors the feedback loop and a much slower 
oscillation (typically in the gamma range).},

carbachol and nanomolar doses of kainate can elicit persistent gamma frequency 
oscillations in all layers of the mouse somatosensory cortex in vitro. Receptor 
pharmacology with bath-applied antagonists indicated that oscillatory network 
activity depended crucially on the participation of cholinergic muscarinic, 
(S)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)/kainate and 
GABAA receptors. 2. The timing of action potentials and the occurrence of 
excitatory as well as inhibitory postsynaptic events was highly correlated with 
the phasic change of extracellularly recorded population activity. Firing 
probability was lowest during the peak negativity of IPSPs and gradually 
increased during their ensuing decay. In conjunction with the effect of a 
barbiturate to decrease the frequency of gamma oscillations, this suggests a 
crucial role of IPSPs in phasing the suprathreshold activity of principal 
neurons. 3. At nearby (< 1 mm) sites contained within any given cortical layer, 
oscillatory extra- and intracellular activity was highly synchronous with no 
apparent phase lag. However, interlaminar mapping experiments demonstrated a 
phase reversal of both extra- and intracellularly recorded activity near the 
lower border of thalamo-recipient layer 4, thus corroborating findings that have 
been obtained in vivo. 4. In conclusion, a modest increase of tonic excitatory 
drive in conjunction with the activation of cholinergic muscarinic receptors can 
elicit persistent gamma frequency network oscillations in the rodent 
somatosensory cortex. These findings (re)emphasize the role of the cholinergic 
ascending system in the cortical processing of sensory information.},

recordings were made from synaptically coupled pyramidal cell-to-interneurone 
pairs (n = 5) of the cat visual cortex in vitro. Pre- and postsynaptic neurones 
were labelled with biocytin, followed by correlated light and electron 
microscopic analysis to determine all sites of synaptic interaction. 2. 
Pyramidal neurones in layers II-III elicited monosynaptic EPSPs in three 
distinct classes of smooth dendritic local-circuit neurones, namely basket cells 
(n = 3), a dendrite-targeting cell (n = 1) and a double bouquet cell (n = 1). 
Unitary EPSPs in basket cells were mediated by one, two, and two synaptic 
junctions, whereas the pyramid-to-dendrite-targeting cell and pyramid-to-double 
bouquet cell interaction were mediated by five and seven synaptic junctions, 
respectively. Recurrent synaptic junctions were found on all somato-dendritic 
compartments, with a tendency to be clustered close to the soma on the double 
bouquet and dendrite-targeting cells. The latter interneurones were reciprocally 
connected with pyramidal cells. 3. Unitary EPSPs had an average peak amplitude 
of 1005 +/- 518 microV, fast rise times (10-90\%; 0.67 +/- 0.25 ms) and were of 
short duration (at half-amplitude, 4.7 +/- 1.0 ms). Their decay was 
monoexponential (tau = 7.8 +/- 4.3 ms) at hyperpolarized membrane potentials and 
appeared to be shaped by passive membrane properties (tau = 9.2 +/- 8.5 ms). All 
parameters of concomitantly recorded spontaneous EPSPs were remarkably similar 
(mean amplitude, 981 +/- 433 microV; mean rise time, 0.68 +/- 0.18 ms; mean 
duration, 4.7 +/- 1.7 ms). 4. In all three pyramidal-to-basket cell pairs, 
closely timed (10-50 ms) pairs of presynaptic action potentials resulted in 
statistically significant paired-pulse depression, the mean of the averaged 
second EPSPs being 80 +/- 11\% of the averaged conditioning event. The overall 
degree of paired-pulse modulation was relatively little affected by either the 
amplitude of the preceding event or the inter-event interval. 5. The probability 
density function of the peak amplitudes of the unitary EPSPs could be adequately 
fitted with a quantal model. Without quantal variance, however, the minimum 
number of components in the model, excluding the failures, exceeded the number 
of electron microscopically determined synaptic junctions for all five 
connections. In contrast, incorporating quantal variance gave a minimum number 
of components which was compatible with the number of synaptic junctions, and 
which fitted the data equally well as models incorporating additional components 
but no quantal variance. For this model with quantal variance with the minimum 
number of components the estimate of the quantal coefficient of variation ranged 
between 0.33 and 0.46, and the corresponding quantal sizes ranged between 260 
and 657 microV. The peak EPSP amplitudes in two of the four connections with 
more than one synaptic junction could be adequately described by a uniform 
binomial model for transmitter release. 6. In conclusion, at least three 
distinct interneurone classes receive local excitatory pyramidal cell input 
which they relay to different compartments on their postsynaptic target 
neurones. The reliability of transmission is high, but the fast time course of 
the EPSPs constrains their temporal summation. Due to the relatively small 
amplitude of unitary EPSPs several convergent inputs will therefore be required 
to elicit suprathreshold responses.}, institution = {Department of Pharmacology,

Tenascin-R and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans are essential components of 
hippocampal extracellular matrix co-localised in perineuronal nets on 
interneurons. Mutant mice deficient in expression of tenascin-R showed a 
two-fold reduction of long-term potentiation induced by theta-burst stimulation 
of Schaffer collaterals in the stratum radiatum of the CA1 region of the 
hippocampus, as compared to wild-type mice. The same reduction in potentiation 
was observed in slices from wild-type mice pretreated for 2h with chondroitinase 
ABC that completely removed chondroitin sulfates from the extracellular matrix. 
Treatment of slices from tenascin-R deficient animals with the enzyme did not 
further reduce potentiation in comparison with untreated slices from these mice, 
showing an occlusion of effects produced by removal of tenascin-R and 
chondroitin sulfates. However, the level of potentiation recorded immediately 
after theta-burst stimulation was significantly higher in wild-type than in 
tenascin-R deficient mice, whereas chondroitinase ABC had no significant effect 
on this short-term form of plasticity. Enzymatic treatment also did not affect 
short-term depression evoked by low-frequency stimulation, whereas this form of 
synaptic plasticity was reduced in tenascin-R deficient mice. In contrast, 
long-term depression in CA1 was impaired by digestion of chondroitin sulfates 
but appeared normal in tenascin-R mutants. Our data demonstrate that tenascin-R 
and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans differentially modulate several forms of 
synaptic plasticity, suggesting that different mechanisms are involved.},

  Abstract                 = {Experimental evidence indicates that synaptic 
modification depends on the timing relationship between the presynaptic inputs 
and the output spikes that they generate. In this letter, results are presented 
for models of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) whose weight dynamics is 
determined by a stable fixed point. Four classes of STDP are identified on the 
basis of the time extent of their input-output interactions. The effect on the 
potentiation of synapses with different rates of input is investigated to 
elucidate the relationship of STDP with classical studies of long-term 
potentiation and depression and rate-based Hebbian learning. The selective 
potentiation of higher-rate synaptic inputs is found only for models where the 
time extent of the input-output interactions is input restricted (i.e., 
restricted to time domains delimited by adjacent synaptic inputs) and that have 
a time-asymmetric learning window with a longer time constant for depression 
than for potentiation. The analysis provides an account of learning dynamics 
determined by an input-selective stable fixed point. The effect of suppressive 
interspike interactions on STDP is also analyzed and shown to modify the 
synaptic dynamics.}, Bdsk-url-1               =

  Abstract                 = {The rules by which neuronal activity causes 
long-term modification of synapses in the central nervous system are not fully 
understood. Whereas competitive or correlation-based rules result in local 
modification of synapses, homeostatic modifications allow neuron-wide changes in 
synaptic strength, promoting stability. Experimental investigations of these 
rules at central nervous system synapses have relied generally on manipulating 
activity in populations of neurons. Here, we investigated the effect of 
suppressing excitability in single neurons within a network of active 
hippocampal neurons by overexpressing an inward-rectifier potassium channel. 
Reducing activity in a neuron before synapse formation leads to a reduction in 
functional synaptic inputs to that neuron; no such reduction was observed when 
activity of all neurons was uniformly suppressed. In contrast, suppressing 
activity in a single neuron after synapses are established results in a 
homeostatic increase in synaptic input, which restores the activity of the 
neuron to control levels. Our results highlight the differences between global 
and selective suppression of activity, as well as those between early and late 
manipulation of activity.}, Doi                      = {10.1038/nature01242},

  Abstract                 = {N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are highly 
expressed in the CNS, mediate the slow component of excitatory transmission and 
play key roles in synaptic plasticity and excitotoxicity. These ligand-gated ion 
channels are heteromultimers composed of NR1 and NR2 subunits activated by 
glycine and glutamate. In this study, patch-clamp recordings were used to study 
the temperature sensitivity of recombinant NR1/NR2B receptors expressed in human 
embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. Rate constants were assessed by fitting a 
six-state kinetic scheme to time courses of transient macroscopic currents 
induced by glutamate at 21.9-46.5 degrees C. Arrhenius transformation of the 
rate constants characterizing NMDA receptor channel activity indicates that the 
most sensitive were the rate constants of desensitization (temperature 
coefficient Q(10)=10.3), resensitization (Q(10)=4.6) and unbinding (Q(10)=3.6). 
Other rate constants and the amplitude of single-channel currents were less 
temperature sensitive. Deactivation of responses mediated by NR1/NR2B receptors 
after a brief application of glutamate was best fit by a double exponential 
function (tau(fast): Q(10)=3.7; tau(slow): Q(10)=2.7). From these data, we 
conclude that desensitization/resensitization of the NMDA receptor and glutamate 
unbinding are especially temperature sensitive and imply that at physiological 
temperatures the channel kinetics play an important role in determining 
amplitude and time course of NMDA receptor-mediated postsynaptic currents and 
these receptors mediated synaptic plasticity.}, Bdsk-url-1               =

suprathreshold sine wave grating patch by a high contrast sine wave grating 
surround pattern was studied as a function of the spatial frequency, orientation 
and spatial extent of the surround. The data are consistent with the existence 
of a complex network of inhibitory interconnections among mechanisms that 
mediate contrast perception. These connections must extend over spatial

(60 mU.m-2.min-1) clamps were performed for 2 h after a 10-h fast and after a 
prolonged (72-h) fast. Biopsies were obtained from the quadriceps femoris muscle 
before and after each clamp. The rate of whole body glucose disposal was 
approximately 50\% lower during the clamp after the 72-h fast (P less than or

proportional to glycolysis) during the clamp after the 10-h fast (to 13.8 +/- 
1.5 mumol.kg fat free mass-1.min-1) was completely abolished during the clamp 
after the 72-h fast (1.7 +/- 0.6; P less than or equal to 0.001). During the 
clamp after the 10-h fast, postphosphofructokinase (PFK) intermediates and 
malate in muscle increased, whereas glutamate decreased (P less than or equal to 
0.05-0.001 vs. basal) and citrate did not change. During the clamp after the 
72-h fast, there were no significant changes in post-PFK intermediates or 
glutamate (P greater than 0.05 vs. basal), but there was a decrease in citrate

glycogen synthase fractional activity in muscle under both conditions but to a 
greater extent after the 72-h fast (P less than or equal to 0.01). It is 
concluded that insulin (after 10-h fast) increases glycolytic flux and the

  Abstract                 = {At many excitatory and inhibitory synapses 
throughout the nervous system, postsynaptic currents become faster as the 
synapse matures, primarily owing to changes in receptor subunit composition. The 
origin of the developmental acceleration of AMPA receptor (AMPAR)-mediated 
excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) remains elusive. We used patch-clamp 
recordings, electron microscopic immunogold localization of AMPARs, partial 
three-dimensional reconstruction of the neuropil and numerical simulations of 
glutamate diffusion and AMPAR activation to examine the factors underlying the 
developmental speeding of miniature EPSCs in mouse cerebellar granule cells. We 
found that the main developmental change that permits submillisecond 
transmission at mature synapses is an alteration in the glutamate concentration 
waveform as experienced by AMPARs. This can be accounted for by changes in the 
synaptic structure and surrounding neuropil, rather than by a change in AMPAR 
properties. Our findings raise the possibility that structural alterations could 
be a general mechanism underlying the change in the time course of 
AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission.}, Bdsk-url-1               =

  Abstract                 = {During cerebellar development, granule cells 
display well characterized changes in the expression of NMDA receptor (NMDAR) 
NR2 subunits, switching from NR2B to NR2A and NR2C in mature cells. Although 
various studies, including experiments on mutant mice with one or more NR2 
subunit types deleted, suggest that NR2A, NR2B, and NR2C subunits contribute to 
synaptic NMDARs, changes in the properties of the mossy fiber EPSC during 
development have not been fully evaluated. In particular, information on NMDAR 
EPSCs in mature animals is lacking. We have examined pharmacological and kinetic 
properties of NMDARs at mossy fiber-granule cell synapses from their formation 
to maturity [postnatal day 7 (P7)-P40 rats]. Significant changes were seen in 
the relative amplitudes of the non-NMDAR- and NMDAR-mediated components of the 
evoked EPSC and in the decay kinetics of the latter. The NMDA/non-NMDA ratio was 
similar at P7, P21, and P40, but showed a clear peak at P12. This change 
coincided with a speeding of the NMDAR EPSC decay, accompanied by a decrease in 
sensitivity to ifenprodil (selective NR2B-antagonist). By P21, sensitivity of 
the NMDAR EPSC to Mg(2+) was approximately threefold less than that at P12 
(IC(50), 76 vs 28 microm), suggesting incorporation of the NR2C subunit. 
However, the predicted slowing of decay kinetics to a value more characteristic 
of NR2C deactivation, was not seen until P40. Our data are consistent with the 
known switch from NR2B to NR2A subunits during the first two postnatal weeks, 
but suggest a gradual incorporation of the NR2C subunit that modifies Mg(2+) 
sensitivity and only later influences EPSC kinetics.}, Institution

of histopathology and cognitive deficits. Using electrophysiological recordings 
and two-photon calcium imaging in young (6-8 weeks old) 3xTg-AD and

ryanodine receptor (RyR)-evoked calcium release within synapse-dense regions of 
CA1 pyramidal neurons. In addition, we uncovered a deviant contribution of 
presynaptic and postsynaptic ryanodine receptor-sensitive calcium stores to 
synaptic transmission and plasticity in 3xTg-AD mice that is not present in 
NonTg mice. As a possible underlying mechanism, the RyR2 isoform was found to be 
selectively increased more than fivefold in the hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice 
relative to the NonTg controls. These novel findings demonstrate that 3xTg-AD 
CA1 neurons at presymptomatic ages operate under an aberrant, yet seemingly

histopathology onset. These early signaling alterations may underlie the later 
synaptic breakdown and cognitive deficits characteristic of later stage AD.},

gain modulation of the neuronal response without appreciable signal-independent

characterization of complex cell RFs in anesthetized animals. Here we apply STC 
to RF characterization in awake monkey V1. We found up to nine subunits for each 
cell, including one or two dominant excitatory subunits as described by the 
standard model, along with additional excitatory and suppressive subunits with 
weaker contributions. Compared with the dominant subunits, the nondominant 
excitatory subunits prefer similar orientations and spatial frequencies but have 
larger spatial envelopes. They contribute to response invariance to small 
changes in stimulus orientation, position, and spatial frequency. In contrast, 
the suppressive subunits are tuned to orientations 45 degrees -90 degrees 
different from the excitatory subunits, which may underlie cross-orientation 
suppression. Together, the excitatory and suppressive subunits form a compact

present in the dendrites of these cells. The EPSC kinetics are fast (tau decay = 
0.82 +/- 0.05 msec at room temperature), consistent with the role these 
interneurons are thought to play in precisely timed inhibitory control of 
Purkinje cells. NMDARs are activated only when glutamate release is increased 
either by facilitation with brief high-frequency trains or by recruiting more 
presynaptic fibers with higher stimulus intensities. Under these conditions, 
EPSCs consist of a fast-rising AMPAR-mediated current followed by a slow 
component mediated by both NMDARs and AMPARs. Inhibitors of glutamate transport 
increase the amplitude and prolong the time course of the compound EPSCs. In 
contrast, the properties of fast AMPAR EPSCs resulting from the activation of 
few inputs remain unchanged when glutamate uptake is blocked. Our results 
suggest that, at these synapses, the postsynaptic density contains AMPARs alone. 
It is only when transmitter release is high enough for glutamate to diffuse to 
the extrasynaptic space and to reach concentrations sufficient to activate 
extrasynaptic receptors that NMDARs are involved in the postsynaptic response. 
We suggest that such a spatial separation of receptor types may provide a 
mechanism for rapid changes in EPSC properties, depending on the amount of 
synaptic activity.}, Bdsk-url-1               = {http://dx.doi.org/20026509},

a large body of experimental data on synaptic tagging and capture,

for the dependence of LTP and LTD induction on voltage and presynaptic 
stimulation frequency. The stabilization of potentiated synapses during the 
transition from early to late LTP occurs by protein synthesis dynamics that are 
shared by groups of synapses. The functional consequence of this shared process 
is that previously stabilized patterns of strong or weak synapses onto the same 
postsynaptic neuron are well protected against later changes induced by LTP/LTD

aim of this work was to assess whether a form of synaptic modification based on 
the theory of Bienenstock, Cooper, and Munro (BCM) can, with a fixed set of 
parameters, reproduce both the kinetics and equilibrium states of 
experience-dependent modifications cortex. 2. According to the BCM theory, the 
connection strength of excitatory geniculocortical synapses varies as the 
product of a measure of input activity (d) and a function (phi) of the summed 
postsynaptic response. For all postsynaptic responses greater than spontaneous 
but less than a critical value called the "modification threshold" (theta), phi 
has a negative value. For all postsynaptic responses greater than theta, phi has 
a positive value. A novel feature of the BCM theory is that the value of theta 
is not fixed, but rather "slides" as a nonlinear function of the average 
postsynaptic response. 3. This theory permits precise specification of 
theoretical equivalents of experimental situations, allowing detailed, 
quantitative comparisons of theory with experiment. Such comparisons were 
carried out here in a series of computer simulations. 4. Simulations are 
performed by presenting input to a model cortical neuron, calculating the summed 
postsynaptic response, and then changing the synaptic weights according to the 
BCM theory. This process is repeated until the synaptic weights reach an 
equilibrium state. 5. Two types of geniculocortical input are simulated: 
"pattern" and "noise." Pattern input is assumed to correspond to the type of 
input that arises when a visual contour of a particular orientation is presented 
to the retina. This type of input is said to be "correlated" when the two sets 
of geniculocortical fibers relaying information from the two eyes convey the 
same patterns at the same time. Noise input is assumed to correspond to the type 
of input that arises in the absence of visual contours and, by definition, is 
uncorrelated. 6. By varying the types of input available to the two sets of 
geniculocortical synapses, we simulate the following types of visual experience: 
1) normal binocular contour vision, 2) monocular deprivation, 3) reverse suture, 
4) strabismus, 5) binocular deprivation, and 6) normal contour vision after a 
period of monocular deprivation. 7. The constraints placed on the set of 
parameters by each type of simulated visual environment, and the effects that 
such constraints have on the evolution of the synaptic weights, are investigated 
in detail.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)}, keywords  = {Animals; Cats;

are themselves governed by GABAergic inputs. To determine directly some of the 
sources and mechanisms of this GABAergic innervation, we have used dual 
intracellular recordings with biocytin-filled microelectrodes and investigated 
synaptic interactions between pairs of interneurons in area CA1 of the adult rat 
hippocampus. Of four synaptically-coupled interneuron-to-interneuron cell pairs, 
three presynaptic cells were identified as basket cells, preferentially 
innervating somata and proximal dendrites of pyramidal cells, but one differing 
from the other two in the laminar distribution of its dendritic and axonal 
fields. The fourth presynaptic interneuron was located at the border between 
strata lacunosum moleculare and radiatum, with axon ramifying within stratum 
radiatum. Action potentials evoked in all four presynaptic interneurons were 
found to elicit fast hyperpolarizing inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (mean 
amplitude 0.35 +/- 0.10 mV at a membrane potential of -59 +/- 2.8 mV) in other 
simultaneously recorded interneurons (n=4). In addition, three of the 
presynaptic interneurons were also shown to produce similar postsynaptic 
responses in subsequently recorded pyramidal cells (n=4). Electron microscopic 
evaluation revealed one of the presynaptic basket cells to form 12 synaptic 
junctions with the perisomatic domain (seven somatic synapses and five synapses 
onto proximal dendritic shafts) of the postsynaptic interneuron in addition to 
innervating the same compartments of randomly-selected local pyramidal cells 
(50\% somatic and 50\% proximal dendritic synapses, n=12). In addition, light 
microscopic analysis also indicated autaptic self-innervation in basket (12 of 
12) and bistratified cells (six of six). Electron microscopic investigation of 
one basket cell confirmed six autaptic junctions made by five of its boutons. 
Together, these data demonstrate that several distinct types of interneuron have 
divergent output to both principal cells and local interneurons of the same 
(basket cells) or different type. The fast synaptic effects, probably mediated 
by GABA in both postsynaptic interneurons and principal cells are similar. These 
additional sources of GABA identified here in the input to GABAergic cells could 
contribute to the differential temporal patterning of distinct GABAergic 
synaptic networks.}, institution = {Department of Pharmacology, Oxford

shares formal qualitative similarities with the selective attention and

neuropathological studies which suggest that affected individuals have either

simulations where the model was taught to discriminate children with autism from 
children with mental retardation, having too few simulated neuronal connections 
led to relatively inferior discrimination of the two groups in a training set

novel test set. Too many connections produced excellent discrimination but 
inferior generalization because of overemphasis on details unique to the 
training set. It is concluded that, within the context of the current model, the 
neuropathological observations that have been described in the literature are 
sufficient to explain some of the unique pattern recognition and discrimination 
learning abilities seen in some people with autism as well as their problems

therefore the amount of sensory information available to an animal, is limited 
by the sensitivity of single neurons in the population and by noise correlation 
between neurons. For decades, therefore, neurophysiologists have devised 
increasingly clever and rigorous ways to measure these critical variables 
(Parker and Newsome, 1998). Previous studies examining the relationship between 
the responses of single middle temporal (MT) neurons and 
direction-discrimination performance uncovered an apparent paradox. Sensitivity 
measurements from single neurons suggested that small numbers of neurons may 
account for a monkey's psychophysical performance (Britten et al., 1992), but 
trial-to-trial variability in activity of single MT neurons are only weakly 
correlated with the monkey's behavior, suggesting that the monkey's decision 
must be based on the responses of many neurons (Britten et al., 1996). We 
suggest that the resolution to this paradox lies (1) in the long stimulus 
duration used in the original studies, which led to an overestimate of neural 
sensitivity relative to psychophysical sensitivity, and (2) mistaken assumptions 
(because no data were available) about the level of noise correlation in MT 
columns with opposite preferred directions. We therefore made new physiological 
and psychophysical measurements in a reaction time version of the 
direction-discrimination task that matches neural measurements to the actual 
decision time of the animals. These new data, considered together with our 
recent data on noise correlation in MT (Cohen and Newsome, 2008), provide a

currents are observed, and (b) to allow physical meaning to be attached to the 
results observed in kinetic (noise and relaxation) experiments in which the 
aggregate of many single channel currents is observed. With this object, 
distributions (and the means) are derived for the length of the sojourn in any 
specified subset of states (e.g. all shut states). In general these are found to 
depend not only on the state in which the sojourn starts, but also on the state 
that immediately follows the sojourn. The methods described allow derivation of 
the distribution of, for example, (a) the number of openings, and total length 
of the burst of openings, that may occur during a single occupancy, and (b) the 
apparent gap between such bursts. The methods are illustrated by their 
application to two simple theories of agonist action. The Castillo-Katz 
(non-cooperative) mechanism predicts, for example, that the number of openings 
per occupancy, and the apparent burst length, are independent of agonist

of an extinct stimulus has been identified as the neural correlate of working 
memory processes. The precise nature of the physiological substrate for this 
self-sustained activity is still unknown. In the last few years, this problem 
has gathered experimental together with computational neuroscientists in a quest 
to identify the cellular and network mechanisms involved. I introduce here the 
attractor theory framework within which current persistent activity 
computational models are built, and I then review the main physiological 
mechanisms that have been linked thereby to persistent activity and working 
memory. Open computational and physiological issues with these models are 
discussed, together with their potential experimental validation in current in

  Abstract                 = {We examined the hypothesis that voltage-dependent 
properties of dendrites allow for the accurate transfer of synaptic information 
to the soma independent of synapse location. This hypothesis is motivated by 
experimental evidence that dendrites contain a complex array of voltage-gated 
channels. How these channels affect synaptic integration is unknown. One 
hypothesized role for dendritic voltage-gated channels is to counteract passive 
cable properties, rendering all synapses electrotonically equidistant from the 
soma. With dendrites modeled as passive cables, the effect a synapse exerts at 
the soma depends on dendritic location (referred to as location-dependent 
variability of the synaptic input). In this theoretical study we used a 
simplified three-compartment model of a neuron to determine the dendritic 
voltage-dependent properties required for accurate transfer of synaptic 
information to the soma independent of synapse location. A dendrite that 
eliminates location-dependent variability requires three components: 1) a 
steady-state, voltage-dependent inward current that together with the passive 
leak current provides a net outward current and a zero slope conductance at 
depolarized potentials, 2) a fast, transient, inward current that compensates 
for dendritic membrane capacitance, and 3) both alpha 
amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid- and 
N-methyl-D-aspartate-like synaptic conductances that together permit synapses to 
behave as ideal current sources. These components are consistent with the known 
properties of dendrites. In addition, these results indicate that a dendrite 
designed to eliminate location-dependent variability also actively 
back-propagates somatic action potentials.}, Institution              =

in the primary visual cortex initially respond vigorously when a preferred 
stimulus is presented, but adapt as stimulation continues. The functional 
consequences of adaptation are unclear. Typically a reduction of firing rate 
would reduce single neuron accuracy as less spikes are available for decoding, 
but it has been suggested that on the population level, adaptation increases 
coding accuracy. This question requires careful analysis as adaptation not only 
changes the firing rates of neurons, but also the neural variability and 
correlations between neurons, which affect coding accuracy as well. We calculate 
the coding accuracy using a computational model that implements two forms of 
adaptation: spike frequency adaptation and synaptic adaptation in the form of 
short-term synaptic plasticity. We find that the net effect of adaptation is 
subtle and heterogeneous. Depending on adaptation mechanism and test stimulus, 
adaptation can either increase or decrease coding accuracy. We discuss the 
neurophysiological and psychophysical implications of the findings and relate it

genetically defined cause of intellectual disabilities. Both hippocampal 
function and volume seem to be disproportionally reduced in individuals with DS 
and in at least one aneuploid murine model of DS, the Ts65Dn mouse. Two previous 
studies by one research group have reported deficits in long-term potentiation 
(LTP) induced by in vitro high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of hippocampal CA1 
synapses of adult Ts65Dn mice. Here, we report on the results of our own 
investigation on LTP in Ts65Dn mice. This study was designed to confirm the 
previous findings and possibly shed some light onto potential mechanisms 
underlying the reported deficit in this important form of long-term synaptic 
plasticity in a mouse model of DS. LTP was induced in area CA1 with either theta 
burst stimulation (TBS) or HFS. Contrary to the previous reports, our results 
showed no significant difference in HFS-induced LTP between Ts65Dn and euploid 
littermate mice. We have found, however, a significant reduction of the amount 
of TBS-induced LTP in Ts65Dn mice compared to euploid controls. Because this 
specific LTP deficit can be rescued by bath application of picrotoxin (10 
microM), we hypothesize that an increase in GABA(A)-mediated inhibition or in 
plasticity of the inhibitory circuitry in Ts65Dn mice may underlie the observed 
deficits. However, future experiments to examine the state of hippocampus CA1 
GABAergic inhibition in Ts65Dn mice will be necessary to further explore these 
hypotheses.}, bdsk-url-1  = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neulet.2005.03.031},

highly diverse across brain area, cortical layer, cell type, and developmental

suggests a specific and essential role in neural information processing. 
Therefore, a correct characterization of short-term synaptic plasticity is an 
important step towards understanding and modeling neural systems. 
Phenomenological models have been developed, but they are usually fitted to 
experimental data using least-mean-square methods. We demonstrate that, for 
typical synaptic dynamics, such fitting may give unreliable results. As a 
solution, we introduce a Bayesian formulation, which yields the posterior 
distribution over the model parameters given the data. First, we show that 
common short-term plasticity protocols yield broad distributions over some model 
parameters. Using our result we propose a experimental protocol to more 
accurately determine synaptic dynamics parameters. Next, we infer the model 
parameters using experimental data from three different neocortical excitatory 
connection types. This reveals connection-specific distributions, which we use 
to classify synaptic dynamics. Our approach to demarcate connection-specific 
synaptic dynamics is an important improvement on the state of the art and 
reveals novel features from existing data.}, bdsk-url-1 =

  Abstract                 = {Most excitatory synapses in the brain use the 
neurotransmitter glutamate to carry impulses between neurons. During fast 
transmission, glutamate usually activates a mixture of N-methyl-D-aspartate 
(NMDA) and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) 
receptors in the postsynaptic cell. Experimental scrutiny of NMDARs provides 
insight into their involvement in excitatory synaptic transmission and related 
processes such as as synaptic plasticity, neural development, and pain 
perception. There is increasing awareness that subtle variation in NMDAR 
properties is imparted by specific receptor subunits, and recent studies have 
started to provide perspective into some of the discrete tasks carried out by 
individual receptor subtypes.}, Bdsk-url-1               =

{FMRP loss of function causes Fragile X syndrome (FXS) and autistic features. 
FMRP is a polyribosome-associated neuronal RNA-binding protein, suggesting that 
it plays a key role in regulating neuronal translation, but there has been 
little consensus regarding either its RNA targets or mechanism of action. Here, 
we use high-throughput sequencing of RNAs isolated by crosslinking 
immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP) to identify FMRP interactions with mouse brain 
polyribosomal mRNAs. FMRP interacts with the coding region of transcripts 
encoding pre- and postsynaptic proteins and transcripts implicated in autism 
spectrum disorders (ASD). We developed a brain polyribosome-programmed 
translation system, revealing that FMRP reversibly stalls ribosomes specifically 
on its target mRNAs. Our results suggest that loss of a translational brake on 
the synthesis of a subset of synaptic proteins contributes to FXS. In addition, 
they provide insight into the molecular basis of the cognitive and allied 
defects in FXS and ASD and suggest multiple targets for clinical intervention.},

{Comput. neuroscience has produced a diversity of software for simulations 
of networks of spiking neurons, with both negative and positive consequences. On 
the one hand, each simulator uses its own programming or configuration language, 
leading to considerable difficulty in porting models from one simulator to 
another. This impedes communication between investigators and makes it harder to 
reproduce and build on the work of others. On the other hand, simulation results 
can be cross-checked between different simulators, giving greater confidence in 
their correctness, and each simulator has different optimizations, so the most 
appropriate simulator can be chosen for a given modelling task. A common 
programming interface to multiple simulators would reduce or eliminate the 
problems of simulator diversity while retaining the benefits. PyNN is such an 
interface, making it possible to write a simulation script once, using the 
Python programming language, and run it without modification on any supported 
simulator (currently NEURON, NEST, PCSIM, Brian and the Heidelberg VLSI 
neuromorphic hardware). PyNN increases the productivity of neuronal network 
modelling by providing high-level abstraction, by promoting code sharing and 
reuse, and by providing a foundation for simulator-agnostic analysis, 
visualization and data-management tools. PyNN increases the reliability of 
modelling studies by making it much easier to check results on multiple

great potential for repair after myocardial infarction. However, poor viability 
of transplanted MSCs in the ischemic heart has limited their therapeutic 
potential. Cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes (CREG) has been identified 
as a potent inhibitor of apoptosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
anti-apoptotic effects of CREG on MSCs under hypoxic and serum deprivation (SD) 
conditions. We also investigated the potential mechanism(s) that may mediate the 
actions of CREG. All experiments were performed on rat bone marrow MSCs. 
Apoptosis was induced by exposure of cells to hypoxia/SD in a sealed GENbox 
hypoxic chamber. Effects of CREG were investigated in the absence or presence of 
inhibitors that target phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). We found that the 
overexpression of CREG markedly protected MSCs from hypoxia/SD-induced apoptosis 
through inhibition of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, leading to 
attenuation of caspase-3. Moreover, CREG enhanced Akt phosphorylation and 
decreased the expression of p53 in MSCs under hypoxic/SD conditions. The 
PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY294002 significantly increased the amount of p53 protein 
and attenuated the anti-apoptotic effects of CREG on MSCs. This study indicates 
that CREG is a novel and potent survival factor for MSCs, therefore, it may be a 
useful therapeutic adjunct for transplanting MSCs into damaged heart after 
myocardial infarction.}, bdsk-url-1  =

defect in a single X-linked gene, called Fmr1, and is characterized by abnormal 
dendritic spine morphologies with spines that are longer and thinner in 
neocortex than those from age-matched controls. Studies using Fmr1 knockout mice 
indicate that spine abnormalities are especially pronounced in the first month 
of life, suggesting that altered developmental plasticity underlies some of the 
behavioral phenotypes associated with the syndrome. To address this issue, we 
used intracellular recordings in neocortical slices from early postnatal mice to 
examine the effects of Fmr1 disruption on two forms of plasticity active during 
development. One of these, long-term potentiation of intrinsic excitability, is 
intrinsic in expression and requires mGluR5 activation. The other, spike 
timing-dependent plasticity, is synaptic in expression and requires 
N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor activation. While intrinsic plasticity was normal 
in the knockout mice, synaptic plasticity was altered in an unusual and striking 
way: long-term depression was robust but long-term potentiation was entirely 
absent. These findings underscore the ideas that Fmr1 has highly selective 
effects on plasticity and that abnormal postnatal development is an important 
component of the disorder.},

  Abstract                 = {At many excitatory synapses, the neurotransmitter 
glutamate diffuses beyond the synaptic cleft to activate extrasynaptic targets. 
The extent and impact of such transmitter "spillover" on the processing capacity 
of neuronal networks are unclear, in part because it remains unknown how far 
transmitter diffuses from its point of release before being removed from the 
extracellular space by high-affinity glutamate transporters. Synaptically 
activated, transporter-mediated currents (STCs) recorded in hippocampal 
astrocytes provide an experimental measure of glutamate uptake, but the time 
course of the STC may be shaped, or "filtered," by other factors and therefore 
not represent a direct indication of clearance rate. Here, STCs were recorded 
from astrocytes in rat hippocampal slices under conditions in which uptake 
capacity was reduced and the STC decay reflected a slowed rate of glutamate 
clearance. The temporal characteristics of the filtering mechanisms were 
extracted from these responses, and the glutamate clearance time course in 
control conditions was derived. The results indicate that glutamate can be 
cleared from the extrasynaptic space within 1 ms. Clearance is fastest in adult 
neuropil, corresponding to a developmental increase in glial transporter 
expression. Synaptically released glutamate is taken up at the same rate as 
glutamate released via flash photolysis, indicating that the spatial location of 
transporters relative to the site of glutamate release does not affect the time 
course of clearance. Slower clearance in young animals would permit glutamate to 
diffuse greater distances, indicating a particularly important role for 
extrasynaptic receptors early in development.}, Bdsk-url-1               =

extrasynaptic diffusion, but it is unclear whether neuronal glutamate

spillover. I examined the effects of a low-affinity competitive NMDA receptor 
antagonist on EPSCs in acute hippocampal slices to distinguish receptors 
activated within active synapses from those activated by spillover. Glutamate 
spillover is observed between Schaffer collateral fiber synapses onto CA1 
pyramidal cells only when transporters in the postsynaptic neuron are inhibited.

(MR) is a developmental brain disorder characterized by impaired cognitive 
performance and adaptive skills that affects 1-2\% of the population. During the 
last decade, a large number of genes have been cloned that cause MR upon 
mutation in humans. The causal role of these genes provides an excellent 
starting point to investigate the cellular, neurobiological and behavioral 
alterations and mechanisms responsible for the cognitive impairment in mentally 
retarded persons. However, studies on Down syndrome (DS) reveal that 
overexpression of a cluster of genes and various forms of MR that are caused by 
single-gene mutations, such as fragile X (FraX), Rett, Coffin-Lowry, 
Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome and non-syndromic forms of MR, causes similar 
phenotypes. In spite of the many differences in the manifestation of these forms 
of MR, evidence converges on the proposal that MR is primarily due to 
deficiencies in neuronal network connectivity in the major cognitive centers in 
the brain, which secondarily results in impaired information processing. 
Although MR has been largely regarded as a brain disorder that cannot be cured, 
our increased understanding of the abnormalities and mechanisms underlying MR 
may provide an avenue for the development of therapies for MR. In this review, 
we discuss the neurobiology underlying MR, with a focus on FraX and DS.},

  Abstract                 = {Native AMPA receptors (AMPARs) exhibit rapid and 
profound desensitization in the sustained presence of glutamate. Desensitization 
therefore contributes to short-term depression at synapses in which glutamate 
accumulates. At synapses that do not exhibit desensitization-dependent 
depression, AMPARs are thought to be protected against prolonged or repetitive 
exposure to synaptically released glutamate. At the cerebellar mossy fiber to 
granule cell (GC) synapse, in which high release probability and glutamate 
spillover produce a substantial buildup of glutamate concentration in the cleft 
([Glut]cleft) during high-frequency transmission, only moderate desensitization 
of the phasic AMPAR EPSC occurs. To investigate how such currents are produced, 
we examined the kinetic properties of synaptic AMPARs in GCs using glutamate 
uncaging. Photolysis of 4-methoxy-7-nitroindolinyl-caged L-glutamate with large 
illumination spots produced step-like increases in [Glut]cleft that could be 
used to systematically probe AMPAR kinetics. At low levels of activation, 
synaptic AMPARs exhibited little desensitization. With larger activations, the 
desensitization time course became faster, but the level of desensitization was 
only weakly dependent on receptor occupancy. Indeed, a substantial 
desensitization-resistant current component remained (17\%) in saturating 
glutamate. Photolysis with small illumination spots produced brief [Glut]cleft 
waveforms and transient AMPAR activations, similar to the EPSC current 
components. Paired-pulse uncaging with such spots revealed little 
desensitization after spillover-like activations and modest depression after 
activations that mimicked quantal and spillover components together. Our results 
show that GC AMPARs exhibit a resistance to desensitization at low occupancies 
and that this property is crucial for sustaining high-frequency transmission at 
a synapse in which glutamate accumulates.}, Bdsk-url-1               =

  Abstract                 = {Acetylcholine receptors in slow fiber 
neuromuscular junctions of garter snake (sp. Thamnophis) produced synaptic 
responses that were more complicated than those observed from twitch fibers. 
Although the slow fiber miniature end plate currents decayed monoexponentially 
with time, both the current fluctuations spectrum and the voltage jump end plate 
current required two temporal components for good theoretical fits. This 
behavior was accurately accounted for by a generalized version of the 
three-state kinetic model by del Castillo and Katz. Application of the model 
allowed not only the rate of channel closing to be estimated, but also the rate 
of channel opening (from the closed state with acetylcholine bound) and the 
apparent rate of acetylcholine unbinding from the receptor. The results suggest 
that at the peak of the miniature end plate current local receptor saturation 
occurs.}, Keywords                 = {Acetylcholine, physiology; Animals;

  Abstract                 = {1. Slow muscle synaptic responses were modelled 
kinetically in an attempt to define the mechanism by which slow fibre 
acetylcholine-operated channels differ from those in twitch fibres. 2. Three 
kinetically distinguishable states were necessary. 3. All applicable three-state 
kinetic schemes were considered in an attempt to identify the simplest 
description of the data. Experimental tets eliminated several models. Two models 
were not tested because they contained an excessive number of adjustable 
parameters. 4. The data were not fitted by kinetic schemes which postulated (i) 
channels which opened with one as well as two bound agonist molecules, (ii) 
channels which became blocked after opening, or (iii) separate populations of 
synaptic and extrasynaptic channels. 5. The three-state kinetic model of del 
Castillo & Katz (1957) accurately described all the data. This sequential model 
relates a closed channel state with no agonist bound to its receptors, an 
intermediate state (also closed) with agonist bound, and an open channel state. 
It is the same model which has been used to describe synaptic responses in 
twitch fibres. 6. The variation which allows this model to describe both twitch 
and slow fibre synaptic responses is the lifetime of the intermediate state. In 
twitch fibres the intermediate state lifetime is undetectably brief by 
electrophysiological methods. However, in slow fibres this lifetime appears to 
be 1-2 msec, varying with voltage. 7. Three of the four transition rates in this 
three-state kinetic scheme may be estimated by fitting the model to the data. 
These are the channel opening rate, the channel closing rate and the rate at 
which closed channels lose their bound agonist molecules. The latter two rates 
appear to depend exponentially on voltage. The channel opening rate was not 
detectably voltage-sensitive.}, Keywords                 = {Acetylcholine,

abstract   = {In macaque monkeys, lesions involving the posterior portion of the 
inferior temporal cortex, cytoarchitectonic area TEO, produce a severe 
impairment in visual pattern discrimination. Recently, this area has been shown 
to contain a complete, though coarse, representation of the contralateral visual 
field (Boussaoud, Desimone, and Ungerleider: J. Comp. Neurol. 306:554-575, '91). 
Because the inputs and outputs of area TEO have not yet been fully described, we 
injected a variety of retrograde and anterograde tracers into 11 physiologically 
identified sites within TEO of seven rhesus monkeys and analyzed the areal and 
laminar distribution of its cortical connections. Our results show that TEO 
receives feedforward, topographically organized inputs from prestriate areas V2, 
V3, and V4. Additional sparser feedforward inputs arise from areas V3A, V4t, and 
MT. Each of these inputs is reciprocated by a feedback projection from TEO. TEO 
was also found to have reciprocal intermediate-type connections with the fundus 
of the superior temporal area (area FST), cortex in the most posteromedial 
portion of the superior temporal sulcus (the posterior parietal sulcal zone 
[area PP]), cortex in the intraparietal sulcus (including the lateral 
intraparietal area [area LIP]), the frontal eye field, and area TF on the 
parahippocampal gyrus. The connections with V3A, V4t, and PP were found only 
after injections in the peripheral field representations of TEO. Finally, TEO 
was found to project in a feedforward pattern to area TE and to areas anterior 
to FST on the lateral bank and floor of the superior temporal sulcus (areas TEm, 
TEa, and IPa, Seltzer and Pandya: Brain Res. 149:1-24, '78), all of which send 
feedback projections to TEO. Feedback projections also arise from 
parahippocampal area TH, and areas TG, 36, and possibly 35. These are 
complemented by only sparse feedforward projections to TG from central field 
representations in TEO and to TH from peripheral field representations. The 
results thus indicate that TEO forms an important link in the occipitotemporal 
pathway for object recognition, sending visual information forward from V1 and 
prestriate relays in V2-V4 to anterior inferior temporal area TE.}, bdsk-url-1 =

  Abstract                 = {Slow N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) synaptic 
currents are assumed to strongly contribute to the persistently elevated firing 
rates observed in prefrontal cortex (PFC) during working memory. During 
persistent activity, spiking of many neurons is highly irregular. Here we report 
that highly irregular firing can be induced through a combination of NMDA- and 
dopamine D1 receptor agonists applied to adult PFC neurons in vitro. The highest 
interspike-interval (ISI) variability occurred in a transition regime where the 
subthreshold membrane potential distribution shifts from mono- to bimodality, 
while neurons with clearly mono- or bimodal distributions fired much more 
regularly. Predictability within irregular ISI series was significantly higher 
than expected from a noise-driven linear process, indicating that it might best 
be described through complex (potentially chaotic) nonlinear deterministic 
processes. Accordingly, the phenomena observed in vitro could be reproduced in 
purely deterministic biophysical model neurons. High spiking irregularity in 
these models emerged within a chaotic, close-to-bifurcation regime characterized 
by a shift of the membrane potential distribution from mono- to bimodality and 
by similar ISI return maps as observed in vitro. The nonlinearity of NMDA 
conductances was crucial for inducing this regime. NMDA-induced irregular 
dynamics may have important implications for computational processes during 
working memory and neural coding.}, Bdsk-url-1               =

  Abstract                 = {Working memory has often been modeled and 
conceptualized as a kind of binary (bistable) memory switch, where stimuli turn 
on plateau-like persistent activity in subsets of cells, in line with many in 
vivo electrophysiological reports. A potentially related form of bistability, 
termed up- and down-states, has been studied with regard to its synaptic and 
ionic basis in vivo and in reduced cortical preparations. Also single cell 
mechanisms for producing bistability have been proposed and investigated in 
brain slices and computationally. Recently, however, it has been emphasized that 
clear plateau-like bistable activity is rather rare during working memory tasks, 
and that neurons exhibit a multitude of different temporally unfolding activity 
profiles and temporal structure within their spiking dynamics. Hence, working 
memory seems to be a highly dynamical neural process with yet unknown mappings 
from dynamical to computational properties. Empirical findings on ramping 
activity profiles and temporal structure will be reviewed, as well as neural 
models that attempt to account for it and its computational significance. 
Furthermore, recent in vivo, neural culture, and in vitro preparations will be 
discussed that offer new possibilities for studying the biophysical mechanisms 
underlying computational processes during working memory. These preparations 
have revealed additional evidence for temporal structure and spatio-temporally 
organized attractor states in cortical networks, as well as for specific 
computational properties that may characterize synaptic processing during 
high-activity states as during working memory. Together such findings may lay 
the foundations for highly dynamical theories of working memory based on 
biophysical principles.}, Bdsk-url-1               =

networks of neurons critically depends on the correlation structure of their 
activity. Neurons with similar stimulus preferences tend to have higher noise 
correlations than others. In homogeneous populations of neurons, this limited 
range correlation structure is highly detrimental to the accuracy of a 
population code. Therefore, reduced spike count correlations under attention, 
after adaptation, or after learning have been interpreted as evidence for a more 
efficient population code. Here, we analyze the role of limited range 
correlations in more realistic, heterogeneous population models. We use Fisher 
information and maximum-likelihood decoding to show that reduced correlations do 
not necessarily improve encoding accuracy. In fact, in populations with more 
than a few hundred neurons, increasing the level of limited range correlations 
can substantially improve encoding accuracy. We found that this improvement 
results from a decrease in noise entropy that is associated with increasing 
correlations if the marginal distributions are unchanged. Surprisingly, for 
constant noise entropy and in the limit of large populations, the encoding 
accuracy is independent of both structure and magnitude of noise correlations.},

pages       = {213--249}, abstract    = {1. Synaptically connected neurones were 
identified in the granule cell layer of slices of 17- to 21-day-old rat 
hippocampus. Whole-cell current recording using the patch-clamp technique 
revealed synaptic currents ranging from less than 10 to 200 pA in symmetrical 
Cl- conditions, at a holding potential of -50 mV. These currents were blocked by 
2 microM-bicuculline, indicating that they result from the activation of 
postsynaptic gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABAA-receptor) channels. 2. 
Addition of tetrodotoxin (TTX, 1 microM) resulted in the loss of most currents 
of more than 40 pA in amplitude. Currents which disappeared after TTX treatment 
were assumed to be the result of spontaneous presynaptic action potentials. The 
currents seen in the absence of TTX are referred to as spontaneously occurring 
inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs); those remaining in the presence of TTX 
were defined as miniature IPSCs. 3. Similar currents were observed when 
recording in the whole-cell configuration while extracellular stimulation was 
applied to a nearby neurone. These currents were also completely blocked by 2 
microM-bicuculline and by 0.5 microM-TTX. They were thus defined as 
stimulus-evoked IPSCs. 4. The half rise time of both miniature and 
stimulus-evoked IPSCs was fast (less than 1 ms). The time course of decay of 
both miniature IPSCs and stimulus-evoked IPSCs could be well fitted with the sum 
of two exponentials. At a membrane potential of -50 mV, the mean decay time 
constants of the two components were 2.0 +/- 0.38 and 54.4 +/- 18 ms (mean +/- 
S.D.) for miniature IPSCs (six cells) and 2.2 +/- 1.3 and 66 +/- 20 ms (three 
cells) for stimulus-evoked IPSCs. 5. Stimulus-evoked IPSCs varied in amplitude 
from less than ten to hundreds of picoamperes. In eight of eleven cells 
histograms of IPSC amplitudes showed several clear peaks which, when fitted with 
the sum of Gaussian curves, were found to be equidistant. This is consistent 
with the view that stimulus-evoked IPSC amplitudes vary in a quantal fashion. 
The quantal size varied between 7 and 20 pA, at a membrane potential of -50 mV. 
6. Decreasing the Ca2+ and increasing the Mg2+ concentration in the 
extracellular solution decreased the number of peaks in the IPSC amplitude 
histogram but did not affect the size of the quantal event.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED

heterozygous mutations in the TSC1 (9q34) or TSC2 (16p13.3) gene and is 
frequently associated with mental retardation, autism and epilepsy. Even 
individuals with tuberous sclerosis and a normal intelligence quotient 
(approximately 50\%) are commonly affected with specific neuropsychological 
problems, including long-term and working memory deficits. Here we report that 
mice with a heterozygous, inactivating mutation in the Tsc2 gene (Tsc2(+/-) 
mice) show deficits in learning and memory. Cognitive deficits in Tsc2(+/-) mice 
emerged in the absence of neuropathology and seizures, demonstrating that other 
disease mechanisms are involved. We show that hyperactive hippocampal mammalian 
target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling led to abnormal long-term potentiation in 
the CA1 region of the hippocampus and consequently to deficits in 
hippocampal-dependent learning. These deficits included impairments in two 
spatial learning tasks and in contextual discrimination. Notably, we show that a 
brief treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin in adult mice rescues not only 
the synaptic plasticity, but also the behavioral deficits in this animal model 
of tuberous sclerosis. The results presented here reveal a biological basis for 
some of the cognitive deficits associated with tuberous sclerosis, and they show 
that treatment with mTOR antagonists ameliorates cognitive dysfunction in a 
mouse model of this disorder.}, bdsk-url-1  =

{Understanding the mechanisms of competitive synaptic plasticity, both 
anatomical and physiological, is of central importance to developmental 
neuroscience. Neurotrophic factors (NTFs) are implicated at almost every level 
of synaptic plasticity, from rapid physiological effects to slower anatomical 
effects, in addition to being implicated in competitive plasticity. Previously, 
we have built and analysed a mathematical model of anatomical synaptic 
plasticity based on competition for neurotrophic support. Here, we extend our 
work to build a combined, anatomical and physiological model. We find that, in 
order to understand the mechanisms of competitive physiological plasticity, we 
must postulate a central role for the change in expression of NTF receptors 
(NTFRs) on afferent synaptic terminals. Only by supposing that the expression of 
NTFRs is governed by NTF uptake do we find that physiological plasticity is 
competitive in character. We perform a fixed point analysis that establishes 
when afferent segregation is possible as a function of the parameters in the 
model, and simulate the model numerically to shed further light on its 
properties. A very clear prediction emerges from our model: that, as the 
efficacy of a terminal that is destined to be retracted due to competitive 
interactions reduces to zero, the NTFRs on that terminal should be 
down-regulated. Furthermore, our model requires that this reduction in synaptic 
efficacy never occurs significantly before the down-regulation in NTFRs. Such a 
prediction should be testable, and renders our model capable of being 
invalidated, in contrast to many other models of synaptic competition, which 
merely impose rather than seek to illuminate the quintessential feature of 
developmental synaptic plasticity.}, institution = {Department of Psychology,

low firing rate and excitatory responses (STSa). Furthermore, we demonstrate on

  Abstract                 = {1. Spatial summation within cat retinal receptive 
fields was studied by recording from optic-tract fibres the responses of 
ganglion cells to grating patterns whose luminance perpendicular to the bars 
varied sinusoidally about the mean level. 2. Summation over the receptive fields 
of some cells (X-cells) was found to be approximately linear, while for other 
cells (Y-cells) summation was very non-linear. 3. The mean discharge frequency 
of Y-cells (unlike that of X-cells) was greatly increased when grating patterns 
drifted across their receptive fields. 4. In twenty-one X-cells the relation 
between the contrast and spatial frequency of drifting sinusoidal gratings which 
evoked the same small response was measured. In every case it was found that the 
reciprocal of this relation, the contrast sensitivity function, could be 
satisfactorily described by the difference of two Gaussian functions. 5. This 
finding supports the hypothesis that the sensitivities of the antagonistic 
centre and surround summating regions of ganglion cell receptive fields fall off 
as Gaussian functions of the distance from the field centre. 6. The way in which 
the sensitivity of an X-cell for a contrast-edge pattern varied with the 
distance of the edge from the receptive field centre was determined and found to 
be consistent with the cell's measured contrast sensitivity function. 7. 
Reducing the retinal illumination produced changes in the contrast sensitivity 
function of an X-cell which suggested that the diameters of the summating 
regions of the receptive field increased while the surround region became 
relatively ineffective.}, Bdsk-url-1               =

simulations of large neural systems with more than 10(4) neurons and 10(7) to 
10(9) synapses. NEST is implemented in C++ and can be used on a large range of 
architectures from single-core laptops over multi-core desktop computers to 
super-computers with thousands of processor cores. Python 
(http://www.python.org) is a modern programming language that has recently 
received considerable attention in Comput. Neuroscience. Python is easy to 
learn and has many extension modules for scientific computing (e.g. 
http://www.scipy.org). In this contribution we describe PyNEST, the new user 
interface to NEST. PyNEST combines NEST's efficient simulation kernel with the 
simplicity and flexibility of Python. Compared to NEST's native simulation 
language SLI, PyNEST makes it easier to set up simulations, generate stimuli, 
and analyze simulation results. We describe how PyNEST connects NEST and Python

Experimental and computational methods have shown that multiple noise sources

  Abstract                 = {Whole-cell voltage recordings were obtained from 
64 synaptically coupled excitatory layer 4 (L4) spiny neurones and L2/3 
pyramidal cells in acute slices of the somatosensory cortex ('barrel' cortex) of 
17- to 23-days-old rats. Single action potentials (APs) in the L4 spiny neurone 
evoked single unitary EPSPs in the L2/3 pyramidal cell with a peak amplitude of 
0.7 +/- 0.6 mV. The average latency was 2.1 +/- 0.6 ms, the rise time was 0.8 
+/- 0.3 ms and the decay time constant was 12.7 +/- 3.5 ms. The percentage of 
failures of an AP in a L4 spiny neurone to evoke a unitary EPSP in the L2/3 
pyramidal cell was 4.9 +/- 8.8 \% and the coefficient of variation (c.v.) of the 
unitary EPSP amplitude was 0.27 +/- 0.13. Both c.v. and percentage of failures 
decreased with increased average EPSP amplitude. Postsynaptic glutamate 
receptors (GluRs) in L2/3 pyramidal cells were of the N-methyl-D-aspartate 
(NMDA) receptor (NMDAR) and the non-NMDAR type. At -60 mV in the presence of 
extracellular Mg2+ (1 mM), 29 +/- 15 \% of the EPSP voltage-time integral was 
blocked by NMDAR antagonists. In 0 Mg2+, the NMDAR/AMPAR ratio of the EPSC was 
0.50 +/- 0.29, about half the value obtained for L4 spiny neurone connections. 
Burst stimulation of L4 spiny neurones showed that EPSPs in L2/3 pyramidal cells 
depressed over a wide range of frequencies (1-100 s(-1) ). However, at higher 
frequencies (30 s(-1)) EPSP summation overcame synaptic depression so that the 
summed EPSP was larger than the first EPSP amplitude in the train. The number of 
putative synaptic contacts established by the axonal collaterals of the L4 
projection neurone with the target neurone in layer 2/3 varied between 4 and 5, 
with an average of 4.5 +/- 0.5 (n = 13 pairs). Synapses were established on 
basal dendrites of the pyramidal cell. Their mean geometric distance from the 
pyramidal cell soma was 67 +/- 34 microm (range, 16-196 microm). The results 
suggest that each connected L4 spiny neurone produces a weak but reliable EPSP 
in the pyramidal cell. Therefore transmission of signals to layer 2/3 is likely 
to have a high threshold requiring simultaneous activation of many L4 neurons, 
implying that L4 spiny neurone to L2/3 pyramidal cell synapses act as a gate for 
the lateral spread of excitation in layer 2/3.}, Institution              = {he

by purely feedforward mechanisms, but can be accounted for by activity-dependent 
changes in the recurrent interactions between different orientation columns. 
Thus, short-term plasticity of the intracortical circuit can mediate dynamic 
modification of orientation tuning, which may be important for efficient visual

  Abstract                 = {The latencies of excitatory and inhibitory 
post-synaptic potentials (e.p.s.p.s and i.p.s.p.s) evoked by electrical 
stimulation of afferents from the lateral geniculate nucleus were recorded in 
neurones of area 17 of the cat visual cortex. After application of an 
extrapolation procedure to compensate for the conduction time of the afferent 
axons, a histogram of latencies formed three distinct peaks. Potentials in each 
of these were interpreted as being mediated by mono-, di- and trisynaptic 
pathways. Characteristic laminar differences in the extracellular field 
potentials evoked from the lateral geniculate nucleus (l.g.n.) and in the 
antidromic activation of neurones from the l.g.n. and superior colliculus were 
used to determine the laminar position of recorded neurones. It was found that 
within a given layer, all cells maintained similar connexions with relay cells 
in the l.g.n. Cells in layers 3, 4, upper 5 and 6 were monosynaptically excited 
by geniculate afferents, while cells in layers 2 and lower 5 received only 
indirect excitation via other cortical neurones. Layer 3 cells were unique in 
receiving a prominent disynaptic e.p.s.p. in addition to the direct excitation 
from the l.g.n. Late, trisynaptic e.p.s.p. components were seen in many layer 5 
and 6 cells. The orderly laminar arrangement of the connexions had the 
consequence that identified cortico-geniculate neurones were monosynaptically 
excited and cortico-collicular neurones di- and trisynaptically excited by 
geniculate afferents. Cortico-cortical neurones in layers 2 and 3 received di- 
or mono- plus disynaptic excitation, depending on laminar position. 
Post-synaptic inhibitory potentials were evoked in all impaled cells, following 
stimulation of the geniculo-cortical pathway. Except for a few layer 2 cells, 
this inhibition was mediated through disynaptic pathways of the feed-forward 
type. There was a good positive correlation between conduction times for 
monosynaptic e.p.s.p.s and disynaptic i.p.s.p.s in the same cells, suggesting 
that cortical neurones receive excitation and inhibition from the same type of 
geniculate afferents. The stimulating electrodes activated not only 
geniculo-cortical afferents, but antidromically activated cortical efferent 
neurones from their extracortical axons. These neurones possess intracortical 
collaterals, and care must be taken to distinguish the resulting potentials from 
those mediated by orthodromic activation of geniculate afferents. In doing so, 
evidence was obtained for excitatory connexions from layers 2 and 3 to layer 5, 
from layer 5 to layer 6, and from layer 6 to layer 4. Typical recurrent 
inhibition was not observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)}, Bdsk-url-1

  = {Altered dendritic spines are characteristic of traumatized or diseased 
brain. Two general categories of spine pathology can be distinguished: 
pathologies of distribution and pathologies of ultrastructure. Pathologies of 
spine distribution affect many spines along the dendrites of a neuron and 
include altered spine numbers, distorted spine shapes, and abnormal loci of 
spine origin on the neuron. Pathologies of spine ultrastructure involve 
distortion of subcellular organelles within dendritic spines. Spine 
distributions are altered on mature neurons following traumatic lesions, and in 
progressive neurodegeneration involving substantial neuronal loss such as in 
Alzheimer's disease and in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Similarly, spine 
distributions are altered in the developing brain following malnutrition, 
alcohol or toxin exposure, infection, and in a large number of genetic disorders 
that result in mental retardation, such as Down's and fragile-X syndromes. An 
important question is whether altered dendritic spines are the intrinsic cause 
of the accompanying neurological disturbances. The data suggest that many 
categories of spine pathology may result not from intrinsic pathologies of the 
spiny neurons, but from a compensatory response of these neurons to the loss of 
excitatory input to dendritic spines. More detailed studies are needed to 
determine the cause of spine pathology in most disorders and relationship 
between spine pathology and cognitive deficits.}, institution = {Department of

spatial selectivity through tuning to combinations of the interaural time 
difference (ITD) and interaural level difference (ILD). The combination of ITD 
and ILD in the subthreshold responses of space-specific neurons in the external 
nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICx) is well described by a multiplication 
of ITD- and ILD-dependent components. It is unknown, however, how ITD and ILD 
are combined at the site of ITD and ILD convergence in the lateral shell of the 
central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICcl) and therefore whether ICx is 
the first site in the auditory pathway where multiplicative tuning to ITD- and 
ILD-dependent signals occurs. We used extracellular recording of single neurons 
to determine how ITD and ILD are combined in ICcl of the anesthetized barn owl 
(Tyto alba). A comparison of additive, multiplicative, and linear-threshold 
models of neural responses shows that ITD and ILD are combined nonlinearly in 
ICcl, but the interaction of ITD and ILD is not uniformly multiplicative over 
the sample. A subset (61\%) of the neural responses is well described by the 
multiplicative model, indicating that ICcl is the first site where 
multiplicative tuning to ITD- and ILD-dependent signals occurs. ICx, however, is 
the first site where multiplicative tuning is observed consistently. A network 
model shows that a linear combination of ICcl responses to ITD-ILD pairs is 
sufficient to produce the multiplicative subthreshold responses to ITD and ILD 
seen in ICx.}, bdsk-url-1  = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/jn.00370.2007}, doi

 = {This paper presents a model of how hippocampal place cells might be used for 
spatial navigation in two watermaze tasks: the standard reference memory task 
and a delayed matching-to-place task. In the reference memory task, the escape 
platform occupies a single location and rats gradually learn relatively direct 
paths to the goal over the course of days, in each of which they perform a fixed 
number of trials. In the delayed matching-to-place task, the escape platform 
occupies a novel location on each day, and rats gradually acquire one-trial 
learning, i.e., direct paths on the second trial of each day. The model uses a 
local, incremental, and statistically efficient connectionist algorithm called 
temporal difference learning in two distinct components. The first is a 
reinforcement-based "actor-critic" network that is a general model of classical 
and instrumental conditioning. In this case, it is applied to navigation, using 
place cells to provide information about state. By itself, the actor-critic can 
learn the reference memory task, but this learning is inflexible to changes to 
the platform location. We argue that one-trial learning in the delayed 
matching-to-place task demands a goal-independent representation of space. This 
is provided by the second component of the model: a network that uses temporal 
difference learning and self-motion information to acquire consistent spatial 
coordinates in the environment. Each component of the model is necessary at a 
different stage of the task; the actor-critic provides a way of transferring 
control to the component that performs best. The model successfully captures 
gradual acquisition in both tasks, and, in particular, the ultimate development 
of one-trial learning in the delayed matching-to-place task. Place cells report 
a form of stable, allocentric information that is well-suited to the various 
kinds of learning in the model.}, bdsk-url-1  = {http://dx.doi.org/3.0.CO;2-1},

CNS disorders. The pathophysiology of this aberrant rhythmic activity is poorly 
understood. We used a computational model of a neocortical network with a 
dynamic homeostatic scaling rule to show that loss of input (partial 
deafferentation) can trigger network reorganization that results in pathological 
periodic discharges. The decrease in average firing rate in the network by 
deafferentation was compensated by homeostatic synaptic scaling of recurrent 
excitation among pyramidal cells. Synaptic scaling succeeded in recovering the 
network target firing rate for all degrees of deafferentation (fraction of 
deafferented cells), but there was a critical degree of deafferentation for 
pathological network reorganization. For deafferentation degrees below this 
value, homeostatic upregulation of recurrent excitation had minimal effect on 
the macroscopic network dynamics. For deafferentation above this threshold, 
however, a slow periodic oscillation appeared, patterns of activity were less 
sparse, and bursting occurred in individual neurons. Also, comparison of 
spike-triggered afferent and recurrent excitatory conductances revealed that 
information transmission was strongly impaired. These results suggest that 
homeostatic plasticity can lead to secondary functional impairment in case of 
cortical disorders associated with cell loss.}, bdsk-url-1  =

have determined that most interaction is from specific well defined regions

complete annulus. Third, it is possible to reverse the inhibition from outside 
the CRF by the addition of a second grating that is orthogonal to the preferred

of the surround. Additional experiments suggest that this process is not 
necessarily involved in figure/ground analysis.}, file      =

abstract    = {Receptive fields of sensory cortical neurons are plastic, 
changing in response to alterations of neural activity or sensory experience. In 
this way, cortical representations of the sensory environment can incorporate 
new information about the world, depending on the relevance or value of 
particular stimuli. Neuromodulation is required for cortical plasticity, but it 
is uncertain how subcortical neuromodulatory systems, such as the cholinergic 
nucleus basalis, interact with and refine cortical circuits. Here we determine 
the dynamics of synaptic receptive field plasticity in the adult primary 
auditory cortex (also known as AI) using in vivo whole-cell recording. Pairing 
sensory stimulation with nucleus basalis activation shifted the preferred 
stimuli of cortical neurons by inducing a rapid reduction of synaptic inhibition 
within seconds, which was followed by a large increase in excitation, both 
specific to the paired stimulus. Although nucleus basalis was stimulated only 
for a few minutes, reorganization of synaptic tuning curves progressed for hours 
thereafter: inhibition slowly increased in an activity-dependent manner to 
rebalance the persistent enhancement of excitation, leading to a retuned 
receptive field with new preference for the paired stimulus. This restricted 
period of disinhibition may be a fundamental mechanism for receptive field 
plasticity, and could serve as a memory trace for stimuli or episodes that have 
acquired new behavioural significance.}, bdsk-url-1  =

equations that describe realistic synaptic dynamics always vary in a limited 
range. Their boundedness makes the synapses forgetful, not for the mere passage 
of time, but because new experiences overwrite old memories. The forgetting rate 
depends on how many synapses are modified by each new experience: many changes 
means fast learning and fast forgetting, whereas few changes means slow learning 
and long memory retention. Reducing the average number of modified synapses can 
extend the memory span at the price of a reduced amount of information stored 
when a new experience is memorized. Every trick which allows to slow down the 
learning process in a smart way can improve the memory performance. We review 
some of the tricks that allow to elude fast forgetting (oblivion). They are 
based on the stochastic selection of the synapses whose modifications are 
actually consolidated following each new experience. In practice only a randomly 
selected, small fraction of the synapses eligible for an update are actually 
modified. This allows to acquire the amount of information necessary to retrieve 
the memory without compromising the retention of old experiences. The fraction 
of modified synapses can be further reduced in a smart way by changing synapses 
only when it is really necessary, i.e. when the post-synaptic neuron does not 
respond as desired. Finally we show that such a stochastic selection emerges 
naturally from spike driven synaptic dynamics which read noisy pre and 
post-synaptic neural activities. These activities can actually be generated by a 
chaotic system.}, bdsk-url-1  = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.2213587}, doi

temporally asymmetric Hebbian (TAH) plasticity is considered as a candidate 
model for the biological implementation of competitive synaptic learning, a key 
concept for the experience-based development of cortical circuitry. However, 
because of the well known positive feedback instability of correlation-based 
plasticity, the stability of the resulting learning process has remained a 
central problem. Plagued by either a runaway of the synaptic efficacies or a 
greatly reduced sensitivity to input correlations, the learning performance of 
current models is limited. Here we introduce a novel generalized nonlinear TAH 
learning rule that allows a balance between stability and sensitivity of 
learning. Using this rule, we study the capacity of the system to learn patterns 
of correlations between afferent spike trains. Specifically, we address the 
question of under which conditions learning induces spontaneous symmetry 
breaking and leads to inhomogeneous synaptic distributions that capture the 
structure of the input correlations. To study the efficiency of learning 
temporal relationships between afferent spike trains through TAH plasticity, we 
introduce a novel sensitivity measure that quantifies the amount of information 
about the correlation structure in the input, a learning rule capable of storing 
in the synaptic weights. We demonstrate that by adjusting the weight dependence 
of the synaptic changes in TAH plasticity, it is possible to enhance the 
synaptic representation of temporal input correlations while maintaining the 
system in a stable learning regime. Indeed, for a given distribution of inputs, 
the learning efficiency can be optimized.}, institution = {Institute of Biology

multiplies postsynaptically two inputs (one excitatory, one inhibitory) that 
converge onto its dendritic tree; in the other model, inhibition is presynaptic

Our pharmacological experiments and measurements of firing rate versus membrane

neuronal excitability is well understood and accurately modeled over timescales

that extends the duration of single-neuron electrophysiological experiments, 
exposing the dynamics of excitability in individual cultured cortical neurons 
over timescales hitherto inaccessible. We show that the long-term neuronal 
excitability dynamics is unstable and dominated by critical fluctuations, 
intermittency, scale-invariant rate statistics, and long memory. These intrinsic 
dynamics bound the firing rate over extended timescales, contrasting observed 
short-term neuronal response to stimulation onset. Furthermore, the activity of 
a neuron over extended timescales shows transitions between quasi-stable modes, 
each characterized by a typical response pattern. Like in the case of rate 
statistics, the short-term onset response pattern that often serves to 
functionally define a given neuron is not indicative of its long-term ongoing 
response. These observations question the validity of describing neuronal 
excitability based on temporally restricted electrophysiological data, calling 
for in-depth exploration of activity over wider temporal scales. Such extended

adults, and post-mortem studies, indicate a normal brain size after correction 
for height, and the absence of neuropathology. Functional imaging with positron 
emission tomography (PET) shows normal brain glucose metabolism, but fewer 
significant correlations between metabolic rates in different brain regions than 
in controls, suggesting reduced functional connections between brain circuit 
elements. Cultured neurons from Ts21 fetuses and from fetuses of an animal model 
for DS, the trisomy 16 (Ts16) mouse, do not differ from controls with regard to 
passive electrical membrane properties, including resting potential and membrane 
resistance. On the other hand, the trisomic neurons demonstrate abnormal active 
electrical and biochemical properties (duration of action potential and its 
rates of depolarization and repolarization, altered kinetics of active Na(+), 
Ca(2+) and K(+) currents, altered membrane densities of Na(+) and Ca(2+) 
channels). Another animal model, the adult segmental trisomy 16 mouse (Ts65Dn), 
demonstrates reduced long-term potentiation and increased long-term depression 
(models for learning and memory related to synaptic plasticity) in the CA1 
region of the hippocampus. Evidence suggests that the abnormalities in the 
trisomy mouse models are related to defective signal transduction pathways 
involving the phosphoinositide cycle, protein kinase A and protein kinase C. The 
phenotypes of DS and its mouse models do not involve abnormal gene products due 
to mutations or deletions, but result from altered expression of genes on human 
chromosome 21 or mouse chromosome 16, respectively. To the extent that the 
defects in signal transduction and in active electrical properties, including 
synaptic plasticity, that are found in the Ts16 and Ts65Dn mouse models, are 
found in the brain of DS subjects, we postulate that mental retardation in DS 
results from such abnormalities. Changes in timing and synaptic interaction

computations on a sensory input stream, biological systems must retain a 
short-term memory trace of their recent inputs. It has been proposed that 
generic high-dimensional dynamical systems could retain a memory trace for past 
inputs in their current state. This raises important questions about the 
fundamental limits of such memory traces and the properties required of 
dynamical systems to achieve these limits. We address these issues by applying 
Fisher information theory to dynamical systems driven by time-dependent signals 
corrupted by noise. We introduce the Fisher Memory Curve (FMC) as a measure of 
the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) embedded in the dynamical state relative to the 
input SNR. The integrated FMC indicates the total memory capacity. We apply this 
theory to linear neuronal networks and show that the capacity of networks with 
normal connectivity matrices is exactly 1 and that of any network of N neurons 
is, at most, N. A nonnormal network achieving this bound is subject to stringent 
design constraints: It must have a hidden feedforward architecture that 
superlinearly amplifies its input for a time of order N, and the input 
connectivity must optimally match this architecture. The memory capacity of 
networks subject to saturating nonlinearities is further limited, and cannot 
exceed square root N. This limit can be realized by feedforward structures with 
divergent fan out that distributes the signal across neurons, thereby avoiding 
saturation. We illustrate the generality of the theory by showing that memory in 
fluid systems can be sustained by transient nonnormal amplification due to 
convective instability or the onset of turbulence.}, bdsk-url-1  =

{Proper brain function requires stringent balance of excitatory and inhibitory

normally sculpt and maintain this balance results in severe dysfunction, causing 
neurodevelopmental disorders including autism, epilepsy and Rett syndrome. Such 
mutations may result in defective architectural structuring of synaptic 
connections, molecular assembly of synapses and/or functional synaptogenesis. 
The affected genes often encode synaptic components directly, but also include 
regulators that secondarily mediate the synthesis or assembly of synaptic 
proteins. The prime example is Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the leading heritable 
cause of both intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders. FXS results 
from loss of mRNA-binding FMRP, which regulates synaptic transcript trafficking, 
stability and translation in activity-dependent synaptogenesis and plasticity 
mechanisms. Genetic models of FXS exhibit striking excitatory and inhibitory 
synapse imbalance, associated with impaired cognitive and social interaction 
behaviors. Downstream of translation control, a number of specific synaptic 
proteins regulate excitatory versus inhibitory synaptogenesis, independently or 
combinatorially, and loss of these proteins is also linked to disrupted 
neurodevelopment. The current effort is to define the cascade of events linking 
transcription, translation and the role of specific synaptic proteins in the 
maintenance of excitatory versus inhibitory synapses during neural circuit 
formation. This focus includes mechanisms that fine-tune excitation and 
inhibition during the refinement of functional synaptic circuits, and later

cerebral cortex gets multiple inputs, and how these inputs are combined or 
selected is a key component of cortical function. Experiments in brain slices or 
other reduced preparations have shown that excitatory inputs to cortex produce a 
delayed feed-forward inhibition, which suggests that the relative timing of 
inputs at the scale of tens of milliseconds is crucial to cortical operation. 
Other mechanisms, such as synaptic depression and feedback inhibition, have also 
been shown to produce strong effects on this timescale. Thus, the relative 
timing of inputs should be fundamental in determining how a given region of 
cortex selects or combines its inputs. A rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) was 
trained to fixate on a spot of light for juice reward. Isolated single units in 
visual cortical area V4 were recorded using standard microelectrode techniques. 
Two visual stimuli were positioned such that each alone elicited a strong 
response. The stimuli were presented both separately and in combination, and 
their contrast and relative onset timing were varied. In general, the response 
of each neuron to two stimuli was locked to the response to that single stimulus 
that produced the shortest latency. A partial exception was that the responses 
to low-contrast stimuli were often less effective at suppressing later-arriving 
responses to high-contrast stimuli. The presentation of two stimuli in the 
receptive field of a visual cortical neuron is proposed as a model system for 
how changes in the relative timing of inputs affect cortical function in the 
intact system.}, bdsk-url-1  = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neulet.2008.02.036},

  Abstract                 = {Astrocytes play a major role in the removal of 
glutamate from the extracellular compartment. This clearance limits the 
glutamate receptor activation and affects the synaptic response. This function 
of the astrocyte is dependent on its positioning around the synapse, as well as 
on the level of expression of its high-affinity glutamate transporters, GLT1 and 
GLAST. Using Western blot analysis and serial section electron microscopy, we 
studied how a change in sensory activity affected these parameters in the adult 
cortex. Using mice, we found that 24 h of whisker stimulation elicited a 2-fold 
increase in the expression of GLT1 and GLAST in the corresponding cortical 
column of the barrel cortex. This returns to basal levels 4 d after the 
stimulation was stopped, whereas the expression of the neuronal glutamate 
transporter EAAC1 remained unaltered throughout. Ultrastructural analysis from 
the same region showed that sensory stimulation also causes a significant 
increase in the astrocytic envelopment of excitatory synapses on dendritic 
spines. We conclude that a period of modified neuronal activity and synaptic 
release of glutamate leads to an increased astrocytic coverage of the 
bouton-spine interface and an increase in glutamate transporter expression in 
astrocytic processes.}, Bdsk-url-1               =

  Abstract                 = {Sleep is strongly involved in memory 
consolidation, but its role remains unclear. 'Sleep replay', the active 
potentiation of relevant synaptic connections via reactivation of patterns of 
network activity that occurred during previous experience, has received 
considerable attention. Alternatively, sleep has been suggested to regulate 
synaptic weights homeostatically and nonspecifically, thereby improving the 
signal:noise ratio of memory traces. Here, we reconcile these theories by 
highlighting the distinction between light and deep nonrapid eye movement (NREM) 
sleep. Specifically, we draw on recent studies to suggest a link between light 
NREM and active potentiation, and between deep NREM and homeostatic regulation. 
This framework could serve as a key for interpreting the physiology of sleep 
stages and reconciling inconsistencies in terminology in this field.},

cortical neurons undergo transient changes of their response properties 
following prolonged exposure to an appropriate stimulus (adaptation). In cat V1, 
orientation-selective cells shift their preferred orientation after being 
adapted to a non-preferred orientation. There are conflicting reports as to the 
direction of those shifts, towards (attractive) or away (repulsive) from the 
adapter. Moreover, the mechanisms underlying attractive shifts remain 
unexplained. In the present investigation we show that attractive shifts are the 
most frequent outcome of a 12 min adaptation. Overall, cells displaying 
selectivity for oblique orientations exhibit significantly larger shifts than 
cells tuned to cardinal orientations. In addition, cells selective to cardinal 
orientations had larger shift amplitudes when the absolute difference between 
the original preferred orientation and the adapting orientation increased. 
Conversely, cells tuned to oblique orientations exhibited larger shift 
amplitudes when this absolute orientation difference was narrower. Hence, 
neurons tuned to oblique contours appear to show more plasticity in response to 
small perturbations. Two different mechanisms appear to produce attractive and 
repulsive orientation shifts. Attractive shifts result from concurrent response 
depression on the non-adapted flank and selective response facilitation on the 
adapted flank of the orientation tuning curve. In contrast, repulsive shifts are 
caused solely by response depression on the adapted flank. We suggest that an 
early mechanism leads to repulsive shifts while attractive shifts engage a 
subsequent late facilitation. A potential role for attractive shifts may be 
improved stimulus discrimination around the adapting orientation.}, bdsk-url-1

in mature brain, neurons responsive to sensory stimuli are tuned to specific 
properties installed shortly after birth. It is amply demonstrated that that 
neurons in adult visual cortex of cats are orientation-selective that is they 
respond with the highest firing rates to preferred oriented stimuli.In 
anesthetized cats, prepared in a conventional fashion for single cell 
recordings, the present investigation shows that presenting a stimulus 
uninterruptedly at a non-preferred orientation for twelve minutes induces 
changes in orientation preference. Across all conditions orientation tuning 
curves were investigated using a trial by trial method. Contrary to what has 
been previously reported with shorter adaptation duration, twelve minutes of 
adaptation induces mostly attractive shifts, i.e. toward the adapter. After a 
recovery period allowing neurons to restore their original orientation tuning 
curves, we carried out a second adaptation which produced three major results: 
(1) more frequent attractive shifts, (2) an increase of their magnitude, and (3) 
an additional enhancement of responses at the new or acquired preferred 
orientation. Additionally, we also show that the direction of shifts depends on 
the duration of the adaptation: shorter adaptation in most cases produces 
repulsive shifts, whereas adaptation exceeding nine minutes results in 
attractive shifts, in the same unit. Consequently, shifts in preferred 
orientation depend on the duration of adaptation.The supplementary response 
improvements indicate that neurons in area 17 keep a memory trace of the 
previous stimulus properties, thereby upgrading cellular performance. It also 
highlights the dynamic nature of basic neuronal properties in adult cortex since 
repeated adaptations modified both the orientation tuning selectivity and the 
response strength to the preferred orientation. These enhanced neuronal 
responses suggest that the range of neuronal plasticity available to the visual 
system is broader than anticipated.}, bdsk-url-1  =

respond essentially to luminance variations occurring within their receptive 
fields. In primary visual cortex, each neuron is a filter for stimulus features 
such as orientation, motion direction and velocity, with the appropriate 
combination of features eliciting maximal firing rate. Temporal correlation of 
spike trains was proposed as a potential code for linking the neuronal responses 
evoked by various features of a same object. In the present study, synchrony 
strength was measured between cells following an adaptation protocol (prolonged 
exposure to a non-preferred stimulus) which induce plasticity of neurons' 
orientation preference.Multi-unit activity from area 17 of anesthetized adult 
cats was recorded. Single cells were sorted out and (1) orientation tuning 
curves were measured before and following 12 min adaptation and 60 min after 
adaptation (2) pairwise synchrony was measured by an index that was normalized 
in relation to the cells' firing rate. We first observed that the prolonged 
presentation of a non-preferred stimulus produces attractive (58\%) and 
repulsive (42\%) shifts of cell's tuning curves. It follows that the 
adaptation-induced plasticity leads to changes in preferred orientation 
difference, i.e. increase or decrease in tuning properties between neurons. We 
report here that, after adaptation, the neuron pairs that shared closer tuning 
properties display a significant increase of synchronization. Recovery from 
adaptation was accompanied by a return to the initial synchrony level.We 
conclude that synchrony reflects the similarity in neurons' response properties, 
and varies accordingly when these properties change.},

of the mouse model of Fragile X Syndrome-the Fmr1 knockout (KO). Overall, these 
alterations result in hyperexcitability of neocortical circuits in the Fmr1 KO. 
Specifically, we observe a substantial deficit in local excitatory drive ( 
approximately 50\%) targeting fast-spiking (FS) inhibitory neurons in layer 4 of 
somatosensory, barrel cortex. This persists until at least 4 wk of age 
suggesting it may be permanent. In contrast, monosynaptic GABAergic synaptic 
transmission was unaffected. Overall, these changes indicate that local feedback 
inhibition in neocortical layer 4 is severely impaired in the Fmr1 KO mouse. An 
increase in the intrinsic membrane excitability of excitatory neurons may 
further contribute to hyperexcitability of cortical networks. In support of this 
idea, persistent neocortical circuit activity, or UP states, elicited by 
thalamic stimulation was longer in duration in the Fmr1 KO mouse. In addition, 
network inhibition during the UP state was less synchronous, including a 14\% 
decrease in synchrony in the gamma frequency range (30-80 Hz). These circuit 
changes may be involved in sensory stimulus hypersensitivity, epilepsy, and

  Abstract                 = {Hippocampal sharp wave-ripples (SPW-Rs) and 
associated place-cell reactivations are crucial for spatial memory consolidation 
during sleep and rest. However, it remains unclear how learning and 
consolidation requirements influence and regulate subsequent SPW-R activity. 
Indeed, SPW-R activity has been observed not only following complex behavioral 
tasks, but also after random foraging in familiar environments, despite markedly 
different learning requirements. Because transient increases in SPW-R rates have 
been reported following training on memory tasks, we hypothesized that SPW-R 
activity following learning (but not routine behavior) could involve specific 
regulatory processes related to ongoing consolidation. Interfering with ripples 
would then result in a dynamic compensatory response only when initial memory 
traces required consolidation. Here we trained rats on a spatial memory task, 
and showed that subsequent sleep periods where ripple activity was perturbed by 
timed electrical stimulation were indeed characterized by increased SPW-R 
occurrence rates compared with control sleep periods where stimulations were 
slightly delayed in time and did not interfere with ripples. Importantly, this 
did not occur following random foraging in a familiar environment. We next 
showed that this dynamic response was abolished following injection of an NMDA 
receptor blocker (MK-801) before, but not after training. Our results indicate 
that NMDA receptor-dependent processes occurring during learning, such as 
network "tagging" and plastic changes, regulate subsequent ripple-mediated 
consolidation of spatial memory during sleep.}, Chemicals                =

  Abstract                 = {An efficient implementation of synaptic 
transmission models in realistic network simulations is an important theme of 
computational neuroscience. The amount of CPU time required to simulate synaptic 
interactions can increase as the square of the number of units of such networks, 
depending on the connectivity convergence. As a consequence, any realistic 
description of synaptic phenomena, incorporating biophysical details, is 
computationally highly demanding. We present a consolidating algorithm based on 
a biophysical extended model of ligand-gated postsynaptic channels, describing 
short-term plasticity such as synaptic depression. The considerable speed-up of 
simulation times makes this algorithm suitable for investigating emergent 
collective effects of short-term depression in large-scale networks of model 
neurons.}, Institution              = {Department of Biophysical and Electronic

simulator-independent NeuroML standards, allowing automatic generation of code 
for NEURON or GENESIS simulators. neuroConstruct was tested by reproducing 
published models and its simulator independence verified by comparing the same

Spectrum Disorders (ASD) may lie in the disruption of excitatory/inhibitory 
(E/I) circuit balance during critical periods of development. We examined 
whether Parvalbumin (PV)-positive inhibitory neurons, which normally drive 
experience-dependent circuit refinement [1], are disrupted across heterogeneous 
ASD mouse models. METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of PV expression in 
previously published ASD mouse models and analyzed two additional models, 
reflecting an embryonic chemical insult (prenatal valproate, VPA) or single-gene 
mutation identified in human patients (Neuroligin-3, NL-3 R451C). RESULTS: 
PV-cells were reduced in the neocortex across multiple ASD mouse models. In 
striking contrast to controls, both VPA and NL-3 mouse models exhibited an 
asymmetric PV-cell reduction across hemispheres in parietal and occipital 
cortices (but not the underlying area CA1). CONCLUSIONS: ASD mouse models may 
share a PV-circuit disruption, providing new insight into circuit development, 
potential prevention and treatment of autism.}, bdsk-url-1  =

not transmit completely randomly, because the probability of transmission 
depends on the recent history of synaptic activity. We examine how a variety of 
spike trains, including examples recorded from area V1 of monkeys freely viewing 
natural scenes, are transmitted through a realistic model synapse with 
activity-dependent depression arising from vesicle depletion or postrelease 
refractoriness. The resulting sequences of transmitted spikes are significantly 
less correlated, and hence less redundant, than the presynaptic spike trains 
that generate them. The spike trains we analyze, which are typical of those 
recorded in a variety of brain regions, have positive autocorrelations because 
of the occurrence of variable length periods of sustained firing at 
approximately constant rates. Sustained firing may, at first, seem inconsistent 
with input from depressing synapses. We show, however, that such a pattern of 
activity can arise if the postsynaptic neuron is driven by a fixed population of 
direct, "feedforward" inputs accompanied by a variable number of delayed, 
"reverberatory" inputs. This leads to a prediction for the number and latency 
distribution of the inputs that typically drive a cortical neuron.}, Institution

states generate a source of internal fluctuations in a neuron, known as channel 
noise. The standard method for modeling the states of ion channels nonlinearly 
couples continuous-time Markov chains to a differential equation for voltage. 
Beginning with the work of R. F. Fox and Y.-N. Lu [Phys. Rev. E 49, 3421 
(1994)], there have been attempts to generate simpler models that use stochastic 
differential equation (SDEs) to approximate the stochastic spiking activity 
produced by Markov chain models. Recent numerical investigations, however, have 
raised doubts that SDE models can capture the stochastic dynamics of Markov 
chain models.We analyze three SDE models that have been proposed as 
approximations to the Markov chain model: one that describes the states of the 
ion channels and two that describe the states of the ion channel subunits. We 
show that the former channel-based approach can capture the distribution of 
channel noise and its effects on spiking in a Hodgkin-Huxley neuron model to a 
degree not previously demonstrated, but the latter two subunit-based approaches 
cannot. Our analysis provides intuitive and mathematical explanations for why 
this is the case. The temporal correlation in the channel noise is determined by 
the combinatorics of bundling subunits into channels, but the subunit-based 
approaches do not correctly account for this structure. Our study confirms and 
elucidates the findings of previous numerical investigations of subunit-based 
SDE models. Moreover, it presents evidence that Markov chain models of the 
nonlinear, stochastic dynamics of neural membranes can be accurately 
approximated by SDEs. This finding opens a door to future modeling work using 
SDE techniques to further illuminate the effects of ion channel fluctuations on 
electrically active cells.}, institution = {University of Washington, Department

fluctuations, we developed a model in which spikes are generated by a Poisson

gain summarizing stimulus-independent modulatory influences on excitability. 
This model provides an accurate account of response distributions of visual 
neurons in macaque lateral geniculate nucleus and cortical areas V1, V2 and MT, 
revealing that variability originates in large part from excitability 
fluctuations that are correlated over time and between neurons, and that 
increase in strength along the visual pathway. The model provides a parsimonious

covariability on firing rate.},

  Abstract                 = {Learning sequential structures is of fundamental 
importance for a wide variety of human skills. While it has long been debated 
whether implicit sequence learning is perceptual or response-based, here we 
propose an alternative framework that cuts across this dichotomy and assumes 
that sequence learning rests on associative changes that can occur concurrently 
in distinct processing systems and support the parallel acquisition of multiple 
uncorrelated sequences. In three experiments we used a serial search task to 
test critical predictions of this framework. Experiments 1 and 2 showed that 
participants learnt uncorrelated sequences of auditory letters and manual 
responses, as well as sequences of visual letters, spatial locations, and manual 
responses simultaneously, as indicated by a reliable response time (RT) cost 
incurred by occasional deviants violating either of the sequences. This RT cost 
was reliable even when participants showing explicit knowledge were excluded. In 
Experiment 3 learning of spatial and nonspatial sequences was functionally 
dissociated: whereas a spatio-motor distractor task disrupted learning of 
location but not of letter sequences, a phonological distractor task had the 
reverse effect. The distractor tasks thus did not reduce unspecific attentional 
resources, but selectively disrupted the formation of sequential associations 
within spatial and nonspatial processing dimensions. These results support the 
view that implicit sequence learning rests on experience-dependent changes that 
can occur in parallel in multiple processing systems involved in spatial 
attention, object recognition, phonological processing, and manual response 
selection. The resulting dimension-specific sequence representations support 
independent predictions of what will appear next, where it will appear, and how 
one will have to respond to it.}, Citation-subset          = {IM}, Completed

However, it is still unclear whether and how the dynamics of the postsynaptic 
calcium alone determine the outcome of synaptic plasticity. Here, we propose a 
calcium-based model of a synapse in which potentiation and depression are 
activated above calcium thresholds. We show that this model gives rise to a 
large diversity of spike timing-dependent plasticity curves, most of which have 
been observed experimentally in different systems. It accounts quantitatively 
for plasticity outcomes evoked by protocols involving patterns with variable 
spike timing and firing rate in hippocampus and neocortex. Furthermore, it 
allows us to predict that differences in plasticity outcomes in different 
studies are due to differences in parameters defining the calcium dynamics. The 
model provides a mechanistic understanding of how various stimulation protocols 
provoke specific synaptic changes through the dynamics of calcium concentration 
and thresholds implementing in simplified fashion protein signaling cascades, 
leading to long-term potentiation and long-term depression. The combination of 
biophysical realism and analytical tractability makes it the ideal candidate to 
study plasticity at the synapse, neuron, and network levels.}, bdsk-url-1  =

on spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP). The common property of the 
discussed models is that synaptic changes depend on the dynamics of the 
intracellular calcium concentration, which itself depends on pre- and 
postsynaptic activity. We start by discussing simple models in which plasticity 
changes are based directly on calcium amplitude and dynamics. We then consider 
models in which dynamic intracellular signaling cascades form the link between 
the calcium dynamics and the plasticity changes. Both mechanisms of induction of 
STDP (through the ability of pre/postsynaptic spikes to evoke changes in the 
state of the synapse) and of maintenance of the evoked changes (through 
bistability) are discussed.}, bdsk-url-1  =

  Abstract                 = {The calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II 
(CaMKII) plays a key role in the induction of long-term postsynaptic 
modifications following calcium entry. Experiments suggest that these long-term 
synaptic changes are all-or-none switch-like events between discrete states. The 
biochemical network involving CaMKII and its regulating protein signaling 
cascade has been hypothesized to durably maintain the evoked synaptic state in 
the form of a bistable switch. However, it is still unclear whether experimental 
LTP/LTD protocols lead to corresponding transitions between the two states in 
realistic models of such a network. We present a detailed biochemical model of 
the CaMKII autophosphorylation and the protein signaling cascade governing the 
CaMKII dephosphorylation. As previously shown, two stable states of the CaMKII 
phosphorylation level exist at resting intracellular calcium concentration, and 
high calcium transients can switch the system from the weakly phosphorylated 
(DOWN) to the highly phosphorylated (UP) state of the CaMKII (similar to a LTP 
event). We show here that increased CaMKII dephosphorylation activity at 
intermediate Ca(2+) concentrations can lead to switching from the UP to the DOWN 
state (similar to a LTD event). This can be achieved if protein phosphatase 
activity promoting CaMKII dephosphorylation activates at lower Ca(2+) levels 
than kinase activity. Finally, it is shown that the CaMKII system can 
qualitatively reproduce results of plasticity outcomes in response to 
spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) and presynaptic stimulation protocols. 
This shows that the CaMKII protein network can account for both induction, 
through LTP/LTD-like transitions, and storage, due to its bistability, of 
synaptic changes.}, Bdsk-url-1               =

familiarity (providing a sense of oldness) and recollection (recovering events

signatures for familiarity and recollection, supporting dual-process theory. One 
outstanding question is whether these signatures reflect the activation of 
distinct memory traces or the operation of different retrieval mechanisms on a 
single memory trace. We present a computational model that uses a single 
neuronal network to store memory traces, but two distinct and independent 
retrieval processes access the memory. The model is capable of performing 
familiarity and recollection-based discrimination between old and new patterns, 
demonstrating that dual-process models need not to rely on multiple independent 
memory traces, but can use a single trace. Importantly, our putative familiarity 
and recollection processes exhibit distinct characteristics analogous to those 
found in empirical data; they diverge in capacity and sensitivity to sparse and 
correlated patterns, exhibit distinct ROC curves, and account for performance on 
both item and associative recognition tests. The demonstration that a 
single-trace, dual-process model can account for a range of empirical findings 
highlights the importance of distinguishing between neuronal processes and the 
neuronal representations on which they operate.}, bdsk-url-1  =

memory) while also retaining memories of specific events (episodic memory). 
Although these two forms of memory have been dissociated on the basis of 
neuropsychological data, it is clear that they typically function together 
during normal cognition. The goal of the present study was to investigate this 
interaction. One influence of semantic memory on episodic retrieval is 'Levels 
Of Processing'; recognition is enhanced when stimuli are processed in a 
semantically meaningful way. Studies examining this semantic processing 
advantage have largely concluded that semantic memory augments episodic 
retrieval primarily by enhancing recollection. The present study provides strong 
evidence for an alternative relationship between semantic and episodic memory. 
We employed a manipulation of the semantic coherence of to-be-remembered 
information (semantically related vs. unrelated word pairs) during an 
associative recognition memory test. Results revealed that associative 
recognition is significantly enhanced for semantically coherent material, and 
behavioral estimates (using the process dissociation procedure) demonstrated 
concomitant changes in the contribution of familiarity to retrieval. 
Neuroimaging data (event-related potentials recorded at test) also revealed a 
significant increase in familiarity based retrieval. The electrophysiological 
correlate of familiarity (the mid-frontal ERP old/new effect) was larger for 
semantically related compared to unrelated word pairs, but no difference was 
present in the electrophysiological correlate of recollection (the left parietal 
old/new effect). We conclude that semantic memory and episodic memory do indeed 
interact in normal functioning, and not only by modulating recollection, but 
also by enhancing familiarity.}, bdsk-url-1 =

AMPA-signalling and AMPA-silent states in a manner not requiring activation of 
NMDA receptors or metabotropic glutamate receptors. NMDA receptor activation by 
correlated presynaptic and postsynaptic activity can switch the nascent synapse

been linked to cells' information-processing capabilities; however, the factors 
determining AIS position in individual neurons remain unknown. Here we show that 
changes in electrical activity can alter the location of the AIS. In dissociated 
hippocampal cultures, chronic depolarization with high extracellular potassium 
moves multiple components of the AIS, including voltage-gated sodium channels, 
up to 17 mum away from the soma of excitatory neurons. This movement reverses 
when neurons are returned to non-depolarized conditions, and depends on the 
activation of T- and/or L-type voltage-gated calcium channels. The AIS also 
moved distally when we combined long-term LED (light-emitting diode) 
photostimulation with sparse neuronal expression of the light-activated cation 
channel channelrhodopsin-2; here, burst patterning of activity was successful 
where regular stimulation at the same frequency failed. Furthermore, changes in 
AIS position correlate with alterations in current thresholds for action 
potential spiking. Our results show that neurons can regulate the position of an

achieve exact integration of leaky integrate-and-fire soma and dynamical synapse 
neuronal models and incorporate spike-time dependent plasticity and axonal 
delays. Highly accurate numerical performance has been achieved by modifying 
simpler forward-Euler-based circuitry requiring minimal circuit allocation, 
which, as we show, behaves equivalently to exact integration. These designs have 
been implemented and simulated at the behavioral and physical device levels, 
demonstrating close agreement with both numerical and analytical results. By 
exploiting finely grained parallelism and single clock cycle numerical 
iteration, these designs achieve simulation speeds at least five orders of 
magnitude faster than the nervous system, termed here hyper-real-time operation, 
when deployed on commercially available field-programmable gate array (FPGA) 
devices. Taken together, our designs form a programmable logic construction kit 
of commonly used neuronal model elements that supports the building of large and 
complex architectures of spiking neuron networks for real-time neuromorphic 
implementation, neurophysiological interfacing, or efficient parameter space

  Abstract                 = {We introduce a method that permits faithful 
extraction of the decay time course of the synaptic conductance independent of 
dendritic geometry and the electrotonic location of the synapse. The method is 
based on the experimental procedure of Pearce (1993), consisting of a series of 
identical somatic voltage jumps repeated at various times relative to the onset 
of the synaptic conductance. The progression of synaptic charge recovered by 
successive jumps has a characteristic shape, which can be described by an 
analytical function consisting of sums of exponentials. The voltage jump method 
was tested with simulations using simple equivalent cylinder cable models as 
well as detailed compartmental models of pyramidal cells. The decay time course 
of the synaptic conductance could be estimated with high accuracy, even with 
high series resistances, low membrane resistances, and electrotonically remote, 
distributed synapses. The method also provides the time course of the voltage 
change at the synapse in response to a somatic voltage-clamp step and thus may 
be useful for constraining compartmental models and estimating the relative 
electrotonic distance of synapses. In conjunction with an estimate of the 
attenuation of synaptic charge, the method also permits recovery of the 
amplitude of the synaptic conductance. We use the method experimentally to 
determine the decay time course of excitatory synaptic conductances in 
neocortical pyramidal cells. The relatively rapid decay time constant we have 
estimated (tau approximately 1.7 msec at 35 degrees C) has important 
consequences for dendritic integration of synaptic input by these neurons.},

  Abstract                 = {1. The properties of glutamate receptor (GluR) 
channels in outside-out patches from the dendrites and somata of rat cerebellar 
Purkinje cells in brain slice were studied using fast agonist application 
techniques. Dendritic patches were isolated 40-130 micronm from the soma. 2. 
Outside-out patches from both dendrites and somata of Purkinje cells responded 
to application of glutamate with a current which desensitized rapidly and nearly 
completely. Currents evoked by glutamate application were blocked by 
6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX), were mimicked by 
L-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA), and were 
modulated by cyclothiazide. Kainate produced small, non-desensitizing currents. 
No currents were observed in response to aspartate application. Responses 
characteristic of NMDA receptor activation were not observed. These findings 
indicate that glutamate-activated currents were mediated by the AMPA subtype of 
GluR. 3. Deactivation of the GluR channels following 1 ms pulses of glutamate 
occurred with a time constant of 1.23 +/- 0.07 ms in dendritic and 1.12 +/- 0.04 
ms in somatic patches. Desensitization occurred with a time constant of 5.37 +/- 
0.26 ms in dendritic and 5.29 +/- 0.29 ms in somatic patches. The time constant 
of recovery from desensitization caused by a 1 ms application of 1 mM glutamate 
was 36 ms in dendritic patches and 33 ms in somatic patches. 4. Half-maximal 
activation of the GluR channels was achieved at a glutamate concentration of 432 
microM. Deactivation kinetics were not dependent on the glutamate concentration, 
while desensitization became slower at lower glutamate concentrations. 5. 
Pre-equilibration of patches with low concentrations of glutamate reduced the 
peak current activated by 1 mM glutamate. The IC50 for this effect was 8.7 
microM. Equilibrium desensitization did not affect the kinetics of the current 
activated by 1 mM glutamate. 6. The current-voltage relationship of the peak 
current was linear in normal Na(+)-rich external solution, with a reversal 
potential near 0 mV. In Ca(2+) -rich external solution, the reversal potentials 
were -51.4 +/- 2.9 and -51.5 +/- 2.8 mV for dendritic and somatic patches, 
respectively, indicating that these glutamate channels have a low permeability 
to Ca2+ (PCa/PCa = 0.053). 7. The mean single-channel conductance of the GluR 
channels measured using non-stationary fluctuation analysis was approximately 8 
pS in dendritic and somatic patches, and the maximum open probability was at 
least 0.7 with 5 mM glutamate. 8. GluR channel kinetics in patches excised from 
the soma of neonatal (postnatal day 4; P4) Purkinje cells, before the 
development of the dendritic arborization of the Purkinje cell, were similar to 
those in patches excised from more mature (P12-18) Purkinje cells. 9. Dendritic 
and somatic GluR channels in Purkinje cells appear to be functionally identical, 
are AMPA-subtype receptors containing the GluR-B subunit, and have rapid 
kinetics and low permeability to Ca2+. A kinetic model was constructed which 
faithfully reproduces the gating characteristics of the GluR channels.},

principal neurones in the CA 1 and in the dentate area. A number of mechanisms 
have been proposed for these actions, including increased potassium conductance, 
increased chloride conductance and electrogenic pump stimulation, and reduction 
of the anomalous inward rectification. Action potentials, and particularly 
bursts of spikes, in CA 1 pyramidal cells, are followed by an 
afterhyperpolarization (AHP) which consists of two components. The late AHP 
depends on a calcium-activated potassium conductance gK+ (Ca2+), and has 
recently been shown to be increased by dopamine. We report here a rapid and 
reversible decrease of the late AHP component following a burst of sodium spikes 
or a calcium spike, during perfusion with micromolar concentrations of histamine 
and noradrenaline. This effect is mediated by H2 receptors and beta-receptors, 
respectively, and occurred in the absence of changes in the calcium spike. By 
such a mechanism histamine and noradrenaline can profoundly potentiate the

position of interneurons in the hippocampal network, fast spiking cells were 
recorded intracellularly in vitro and filled with biocytin. Sixteen 
non-principal cells were selected on the basis of 1) cell bodies located in the 
pyramidal layer and in the middle of the slice, 2) extensive labeling of their 
axons, and 3) a branching pattern of the axon indicating that they were not 
axo-axonic cells. Examination of their efferent synapses (n = 400) demonstrated 
that the cells made synapses on cell bodies, dendritic shafts, spines, and axon 
initial segments (AIS). Statistical analysis of the distribution of different 
postsynaptic elements, together with published data (n = 288) for 12 similar 
cells, showed that the interneurons were heterogeneous with regard to the 
frequency of synapses given to different parts of pyramidal cells. When the 
cells were grouped according to whether they had less or more than 40\% somatic 
synaptic targets, each population appeared homogeneous. The population (n = 19) 
innervating a high proportion of somata (53 +/- 10\%, SD) corresponds to basket 
cells. They also form synapses with proximal dendrites (44 +/- 12\%) and rarely 
with AISs and spines. One well-filled basket cell had 8,859 boutons within the 
slice, covering an area of 0.331 mm2 of pyramidal layer tangentially and 
containing 7,150 pyramidal cells, 933 (13\%) of which were calculated to be 
innervated, assuming that each pyramidal cell received nine to ten synapses. It 
was extrapolated that the intact axon probably had about 10,800 boutons 
innervating 1,140 pyramids. The proportion of innervated pyramidal cells 
decreased from 28\% in the middle to 4\% at the edge of the axonal field. The 
other group of neurons, the bistratified cells (n = 9), showed a preference for 
dendritic shafts (79 +/- 8\%) and spines (17 +/- 8\%) as synaptic targets, 
rarely terminating on somata (4 +/- 8\%). Their axonal field was significantly 
larger (1,250 +/- 180 microns) in the medio-lateral direction than that of 
basket cells (760 +/- 130 microns). The axon terminals of bistratified cells 
were smaller than those of basket cells. Furthermore, in constrast to 
bistratified cells, basket cells had a significant proportion of dendrites in 
stratum lacunosum-moleculare suggesting a direct entorhinal input. The results 
define two distinct types of GABAergic neuron innervating pyramidal cells in a 
spatially segregated manner and predict different functions for the two inputs. 
The perisomatic termination of basket cells is suited for the synchronization of 
a subset of pyramidal cells that they select from the population within their 
axonal field, whereas the termination of bistratified cells in conjunction with 
Schaffer collateral/commissural terminals may govern the timing of CA3 input 
and/or voltage-dependent conductances in the dendrites.}, bdsk-url-1  =

mechanism for generating repeated spike patterns (RSPs). The propagation speed 
of the pulse packet determines the temporal property of RSPs. However, the 
relationship between propagation speed and network structure is not well 
understood. We studied a feedforward network with Mexican-hat connectivity by 
using the leaky integrate-and-fire neuron model and analyzed the network 
dynamics with the Fokker-Planck equation. We examined the effect of the spatial 
pattern of pulse packets on RSPs in the network with multistability. Pulse 
packets can take spatially uniform or localized shapes in a multistable regime, 
and they propagate with different speeds. These distinct pulse packets generate 
RSPs with different timescales, but the order of spikes and the ratios between 
interspike intervals are preserved. This result indicates that the RSPs can be 
transformed into the same template pattern through the expanding or contracting 
operation of the timescale.}, bdsk-url-1  =

states through a feedforward neural network with Mexican-hat-type connectivity. 
The prevalence of columnar structures in a cortex implies spatially localized 
connectivity between neural pools. Although feedforward neural network models 
with homogeneous connectivity have been intensively studied within the context 
of the synfire chain, the effect of local connectivity has not yet been studied 
so thoroughly. When a neuron fires independently, the dynamics of macroscopic 
state variables (a firing rate and spatial eccentricity of a firing pattern) is 
deterministic from the law of large numbers. Possible stable firing states, 
which are derived from deterministic evolution equations, are uniform, 
localized, and nonfiring. The multistability of these three states is obtained 
where the excitatory and inhibitory interactions among neurons are balanced. 
When the presynapse-dependent variance in connection efficacies is incorporated 
into the network, the variance generates common noise. Then the evolution of the 
macroscopic state variables becomes stochastic, and neurons begin to fire in a 
correlated manner due to the common noise. The correlation structure that is 
generated by common noise exhibits a nontrivial bimodal distribution. The 
development of a firing state through neural layers does not converge to a

  Abstract                 = {In response to decreased activity, neurons make 
global compensatory increases in excitatory synaptic strength. However, how 
neuronal maturity affects this process is unclear. We silenced cultured 
hippocampal neurons with TTX at 7 days in vitro, during rapid synaptogenesis, 
and at 14 days, when major synaptogenesis is complete. For each age, we have 
explored the effects of short (1 day) and longer (2 days) periods of silencing. 
We have confirmed that the changes in synaptic strength depend on 2 main 
mechanisms, one presynaptic and the other postsynaptic. The presynaptic 
mechanism involves an increase in the probability of neurotransmitter release, 
mostly arising through an increase in the number of synaptic vesicles available 
for release. The postsynaptic mechanism operates through an increase in the 
number of postsynaptic receptors for the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. 
When neurons are silenced for 1 day, young neurons employ the postsynaptic 
mechanism, whereas more mature neurons increase their strength through the 
presynaptic mechanism. The postsynaptic strengthening in young neurons does not 
depend on gene transcription, whereas the presynaptic mechanism does. If neurons 
are silenced for 2 days, younger and older neurons employ both pre and 
postsynaptic mechanisms for synaptic strengthening. We also found evidence for 2 
additional mechanisms that increased the effective synaptic coupling between 
neurons after 2 days of silencing: an increase in the number of synapses, and an 
increase in the electrotonic length of dendrites. These results expand our basic 
understanding of neuronal homeostasis, and reveal the developmental regulation 
of its expression mechanisms.}, Doi                      =

  Abstract                 = {During brain maturation, the occurrence of the 
extracellular matrix (ECM) terminates juvenile plasticity by mediating 
structural stability. Interestingly, enzymatic removal of the ECM restores 
juvenile forms of plasticity, as for instance demonstrated by topographical 
reconnectivity in sensory pathways. However, to which degree the mature ECM is a 
compromise between stability and flexibility in the adult brain impacting 
synaptic plasticity as a fundamental basis for learning, lifelong memory 
formation, and higher cognitive functions is largely unknown. In this study, we 
removed the ECM in the auditory cortex of adult Mongolian gerbils during 
specific phases of cortex-dependent auditory relearning, which was induced by 
the contingency reversal of a frequency-modulated tone discrimination, a task 
requiring high behavioral flexibility. We found that ECM removal promoted a 
significant increase in relearning performance, without erasing already 
established-that is, learned-capacities when continuing discrimination training. 
The cognitive flexibility required for reversal learning of previously acquired 
behavioral habits, commonly understood to mainly rely on frontostriatal 
circuits, was enhanced by promoting synaptic plasticity via ECM removal within 
the sensory cortex. Our findings further suggest experimental modulation of the 
cortical ECM as a tool to open short-term windows of enhanced activity-dependent 
reorganization allowing for guided neuroplasticity.}, Citation-subset          =

potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission underlies aspects of learning and

network models predict interactions between plasticity at nearby synapses. Here 
we show in mouse hippocampal pyramidal cells that LTP at individual synapses 
reduces the threshold for potentiation at neighbouring synapses. After 
input-specific LTP induction by two-photon glutamate uncaging or by synaptic 
stimulation, subthreshold stimuli, which by themselves were too weak to trigger 
LTP, caused robust LTP and spine enlargement at neighbouring spines. 
Furthermore, LTP induction broadened the presynaptic-postsynaptic spike interval 
for spike-timing-dependent LTP within a dendritic neighbourhood. The reduction 
in the threshold for LTP induction lasted approximately 10 min and spread over 
approximately 10 microm of dendrite. These local interactions between 
neighbouring synapses support clustered plasticity models of memory storage and 
could allow for the binding of behaviourally linked information on the same

  Abstract                 = {Changes in the synaptic connection strengths 
between neurons are believed to play a role in memory formation. An important 
mechanism for changing synaptic strength is through movement of neurotransmitter 
receptors and regulatory proteins to and from the synapse. Several 
activity-triggered biochemical events control these movements. Here we use 
computer models to explore how these putative memory-related changes can be 
stabilised long after the initial trigger, and beyond the lifetime of synaptic 
molecules. We base our models on published biochemical data and experiments on 
the activity-dependent movement of a glutamate receptor, AMPAR, and a 
calcium-dependent kinase, CaMKII. We find that both of these molecules 
participate in distinct bistable switches. These simulated switches are 
effective for long periods despite molecular turnover and biochemical 
fluctuations arising from the small numbers of molecules in the synapse. The 
AMPAR switch arises from a novel self-recruitment process where the presence of 
sufficient receptors biases the receptor movement cycle to insert still more 
receptors into the synapse. The CaMKII switch arises from autophosphorylation of 
the kinase. The switches may function in a tightly coupled manner, or relatively 
independently. The latter case leads to multiple stable states of the synapse. 
We propose that similar self-recruitment cycles may be important for maintaining 
levels of many molecules that undergo regulated movement, and that these may 
lead to combinatorial possible stable states of systems like the synapse.},

  Abstract                 = {Fusion of a vesicle with the cell membrane opens a 
pore that releases transmitter to the extracellular space. The pore can either 
dilate fully so that the vesicle collapses completely, or close rapidly to 
generate 'kiss-and-run' fusion. The size of the pore determines the release 
rate. At synapses, the size of the fusion pore is unclear, 'kiss-and-run' 
remains controversial, and the ability of 'kiss-and-run' fusion to generate 
rapid synaptic currents is questionable. Here, by recording fusion pore kinetics 
during single vesicle fusion, we found both full collapse and 'kiss-and-run' 
fusion at calyx-type synapses. For full collapse, the initial fusion pore 
conductance (G(p)) was usually >375 pS and increased rapidly at > or =299 pS 
ms(-1). 'Kiss-and-run' fusion was seen as a brief capacitance flicker (<2 s) 
with G(p) >288 pS for most flickers, but within 15-288 pS for the remaining 
flickers. Large G(p) (>288 pS) might discharge transmitter rapidly and thereby 
cause rapid synaptic currents, whereas small G(p) might generate slow and small 
synaptic currents. These results show that 'kiss-and-run' fusion occurs at 
synapses and that it can generate rapid postsynaptic currents, and suggest that 
various fusion pore sizes help to control the kinetics and amplitude of synaptic 
currents.}, Bdsk-url-1               = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature05250},

excitatory synaptic transmission. Upon fast consecutive synaptic stimulation, 
transmission can be depressed. Recuperation from fast synaptic depression has 
been attributed solely to recovery of transmitter release and/or AMPAR 
desensitization. We show that AMPAR lateral diffusion, observed in both intact 
hippocampi and cultured neurons, allows fast exchange of desensitized receptors 
with na?ve functional ones within or near the postsynaptic density. Recovery 
from depression in the tens of millisecond time range can be explained in part 
by this fast receptor exchange. Preventing AMPAR surface movements through 
cross-linking, endogenous clustering, or calcium rise all slow recovery from 
depression. Physiological regulation of postsynaptic receptor mobility affects 
the fidelity of synaptic transmission by shaping the frequency dependence of 
synaptic responses.}, Bdsk-url-1               =

= {31}, abstract    = {The human brain has often been viewed as outstanding 
among mammalian brains: the most cognitively able, the largest-than-expected 
from body size, endowed with an overdeveloped cerebral cortex that represents 
over 80\% of brain mass, and purportedly containing 100 billion neurons and 10x 
more glial cells. Such uniqueness was seemingly necessary to justify the 
superior cognitive abilities of humans over larger-brained mammals such as 
elephants and whales. However, our recent studies using a novel method to 
determine the cellular composition of the brain of humans and other primates as 
well as of rodents and insectivores show that, since different cellular scaling 
rules apply to the brains within these orders, brain size can no longer be 
considered a proxy for the number of neurons in the brain. These studies also 
showed that the human brain is not exceptional in its cellular composition, as 
it was found to contain as many neuronal and non-neuronal cells as would be 
expected of a primate brain of its size. Additionally, the so-called 
overdeveloped human cerebral cortex holds only 19\% of all brain neurons, a 
fraction that is similar to that found in other mammals. In what regards 
absolute numbers of neurons, however, the human brain does have two advantages 
compared to other mammalian brains: compared to rodents, and probably to whales 
and elephants as well, it is built according to the very economical, 
space-saving scaling rules that apply to other primates; and, among economically 
built primate brains, it is the largest, hence containing the most neurons. 
These findings argue in favor of a view of cognitive abilities that is centered 
on absolute numbers of neurons, rather than on body size or encephalization, and 
call for a re-examination of several concepts related to the exceptionality of 
the human brain.}, bdsk-url-1  = {http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/neuro.09.031.2009},

no effect on growth rate. Mineral and vitamin supplements influenced neither the

stimuli. 2. In the anterior bank of the caudal STS, there were three regions 
distinguishable from each other and also from the middle temporal area (MT) in 
the floor of the STS and area Tpt in the superior temporal gyrus. The three 
regions were located approximately in the respective inner, middle, and outer 
thirds of the anterior bank of the caudal STS. These three regions are referred 
to, from the inner to the outer, as the medial superior temporal region (MST), 
the mostly unresponsive region, and the caudal STS polysensory region (cSTP), 
respectively. 3. The extent of MST and its response properties agreed with 
previous studies. Cells in MST responded exclusively to visual stimuli, had 
large visual receptive fields (RFs), and nearly all (91\%) showed directional 
selectivity. 4. In the mostly unresponsive region, three quarters of cells were 
unresponsive to any stimulus used in this study. A quarter of the cells 
responded to only visual stimuli and most did not show directional selectivity 
for moving stimuli. Several directionally selective cells responded to movements 
of three-dimensional objects, but not of projected stimuli. 5. The response 
properties of cells in the superficial cortex of the caudal superior temporal 
gyrus, a part of area Tpt, external to cSTP were different from those of cells 
in the three regions in the anterior bank of the STS. Cells in Tpt were 
exclusively auditory, and had much larger auditory RFs (mean = 271 degrees) than 
those of acoustically-driven cSTP cells (mean = 138 degrees). 6. The cSTP 
contained unimodal visual, auditory, and somesthetic cells as well as multimodal 
cells of two or all three modalities. The sensory properties of cSTP cells were 
as follows. 1) Out of 200 cells recorded, 102 (51\%) cells were unimodal (59 
visual, 33 auditory, and 10 somesthetic), 36 (18\%) cells were bimodal (21 
visual+auditory, 7 visual+somesthetic, and 8 auditory+somesthetic), and four 
(2\%) cells were trimodal. Visual and auditory responses were more frequent than 
somesthetic responses: the ratio of the population of cells driven by visual: 
auditory: somesthetic stimuli was 3:2:1. 2) Visual RFs were large (mean 
diameter, 59 degrees), but two-thirds were limited to the contralateral visual 
hemifield. About half the cells showed directional selectivity for moving visual 
stimuli. None showed selectivity for particular visual shapes.(ABSTRACT

induction of associative long-term potentiation (LTP) in the dentate gyrus is 
thought to depend on Ca2+ influx through channels controlled by 
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, quantitative modeling was performed of 
synaptically mediated Ca2+ influx as a function of synaptic coactivation. The 
goal was to determine whether Ca2+ influx through NMDA-receptor channels was, by 
itself, sufficient to explain associative LTP, including control experiments and 
the temporal requirements of LTP. 2. Ca2+ influx through NMDA-receptor channels 
was modeled at a synapse on a dendritic spine of a reconstructed hippocampal 
dentate granule cell when 1-115 synapses on spines at different dendritic 
locations were activated eight times at frequencies of 10-800 Hz. The resulting 
change in [Ca2+] in the spine head was estimated from the Ca2+ influx with the 
use of a model of a dendritic spine that included Ca2+ buffers, pumps, and 
diffusion. 3. To use a compelling model of synaptic activation, we developed 
quantitative descriptions of the NMDA and non-NMDA receptor-mediated 
conductances consistent with available experimental data. The experimental data 
reported for NMDA and non-NMDA receptor-channel properties and data from other 
non-LTP experiments that separated the NMDA and non-NMDA receptor-mediated 
components of synaptic events proved to be limiting for particular synaptic 
variables. Relative to the non-NMDA glutamate-type receptors, 1) the unbinding 
of transmitter from NMDA receptors had to be slow, 2) the transition from the 
bound NMDA receptor-transmitter complex to the open channel state had to be even 
slower, and 3) the average number of NMDA-receptor channels at a single 
activated synapse on a single spine head that were open and conducting at a 
given moment in time had to be very small (usually less than 1). 4. With the use 
of these quantitative synaptic conductance descriptions. Ca2+ influx through 
NMDA-receptor channels at a synapse was computed for a variety of conditions. 
For a constant number of pulses, Ca2+ influx was calculated as a function of 
input frequency and the number of coactivated synapses. When few synapses were 
coactivated, Ca2+ influx was small, even for high-frequency activation. However, 
with larger numbers of coactivated synapses, there was a steep increase in Ca2+ 
influx with increasing input frequency because of the voltage-dependent nature 
of the NMDA receptor-mediated conductance. Nevertheless, total Ca2+ influx was 
never increased more than fourfold by increasing input frequency or the number 
of coactivated synapses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)}, institution =

mechanisms remain unknown. Growth and retraction of dendritic spines with 
synapse formation and elimination could change brain circuits. In the apical 
tufts of layer 5B (L5B) pyramidal neurons in the mouse barrel cortex, a subset 
of dendritic spines appear and disappear over days, whereas most spines are 
persistent for months. Under baseline conditions, new spines are mostly 
transient and rarely survive for more than a week. Transient spines tend to be 
small, whereas persistent spines are usually large. Because most excitatory 
synapses in the cortex occur on spines, and because synapse size and the number 
of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors 
are proportional to spine volume, the excitation of pyramidal neurons is 
probably driven through synapses on persistent spines. Here we test whether the 
generation and loss of persistent spines are enhanced by novel sensory 
experience. We repeatedly imaged dendritic spines for one month after trimming 
alternate whiskers, a paradigm that induces adaptive functional changes in 
neocortical circuits. Whisker trimming stabilized new spines and destabilized 
previously persistent spines. New-persistent spines always formed synapses. They 
were preferentially added on L5B neurons with complex apical tufts rather than 
simple tufts. Our data indicate that novel sensory experience drives the 
stabilization of new spines on subclasses of cortical neurons. These synaptic 
changes probably underlie experience-dependent remodelling of specific

incidence is indispensable for the active prevention and control of acute 
myocardial infarction (AMI). The purpose of this study was to provide basic 
information for the establishment of policy related to AMI by examining the 
long-term trends in incidence of AMI. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This study 
identified the trend in disease incidence during between 1997 and 2007 using the 
Korean National Health Insurance Database that includes AMI {the 10th 
International Classification of Disease (ICD-10) code: I21, I22, I23, I250, 
I251} as a primary or secondary disease. RESULTS: The attack and incidence rates 
for AMI in 2007 were 118.4 and 91.8 per 100,000 persons, respectively, and the 
rates more than doubled for the 11 years. Both rates were higher among males 
than females and increased more in the older age groups. Incidence cases 
accounted for most of the total attack cases every year; however, in recent 
years the proportion of relapse cases was on the rise. The case fatality rate 
was highest (14.5\%) in 2000, and declined rapidly to 9.8\% in 2007. The case 
fatality rate was higher among females than males and the older age groups; in 
particular, female patients >/=65 years of age had the highest fatality rate. 
CONCLUSION: This study showed that AMI has been on the rise in Korea for 11 
years. Therefore, the establishment of policy for intensive control of the 
incidence of AMI is necessary by building a continuous monitoring and 
surveillance system.}, bdsk-url-1  =

mathematical and computer modelling of learning and 'unlearning' in a collective 
neural network of 30-1,000 neurones. The model network has a content-addressable 
memory or 'associative memory' which allows it to learn and store many memories. 
A particular memory can be evoked in its entirety when the network is stimulated 
by any adequate-sized subpart of the information of that memory. But different 
memories of the same size are not equally easy to recall. Also, when memories 
are learned, spurious memories are also created and can also be evoked. Applying 
an 'unlearning' process, similar to the learning processes but with a reversed 
sign and starting from a noise input, enhances the performance of the network in 
accessing real memories and in minimizing spurious ones. Although our model was 
not motivated by higher nervous function, our system displays behaviours which 
are strikingly parallel to those needed for the hypothesized role of 
'unlearning' in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.}, keywords    = {Animals; Brain,

hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Our study is motivated by experimental evidence 
that there are regulatory mechanisms that take part in the homeostasis of 
neuronal activity and act on the neuronal level. We show that following synaptic 
deletion, synaptic compensation can be carried out efficiently by a local, 
dynamic mechanism, where each neuron maintains the profile of its incoming 
post-synaptic current. Our results open up the possibility that the primary 
factor in the pathogenesis of cognitive deficiencies in Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
is the failure of local neuronal regulatory mechanisms. Allowing for neuronal 
death, we observe two pathological routes in AD, leading to different 
correlations between the levels of structural damage and functional decline.},

The patterns of error generalization suggest that the neural elements that

tuning that is modulated monotonically with limb position. The gain-field

nonmonotonic force patterns should be more difficult to learn than monotonic

required to induce synaptic scaling. Here, we selectively block either 
postsynaptic firing in individual neurons or a fraction of presynaptic inputs, 
while optically monitoring changes in synaptic strength. We find that synaptic 
scaling is rapidly induced by block of postsynaptic firing, but not by local 
synaptic blockade, and is mediated through a drop in somatic calcium influx, 
reduced activation of CaMKIV, and an increase in transcription. Cortical neurons 
thus homeostatically adjust synaptic strengths in response to changes in their

normalizing synaptic strengths without interfering with synapse-specific

excitatory synapses on hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells that express NMDA 
receptors (NMDARs) may not express functional AMPA receptors (AMPARs), thus 
making these synapses silent at the resting membrane potential. In agreement 
with this hypothesis, we demonstrate here that it is possible to stimulate 
synapses that yield no detectable excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) when 
the cell is held at -60 mV; yet at positive holding potentials (+30 to +60 mV), 
EPSCs can be elicited that are completely blocked by the NMDAR antagonist, 
D-APV. When these functionally silent synapses are subjected to an LTP induction 
protocol, EPSCs mediated by AMPARs appear and remain for the duration of the 
experiment. This conversion of silent synapses to functional synapses is blocked 
by D-APV. These results suggest that LTP may involve modification of AMPARs 
that, prior to LTP, were either not present in the postsynaptic membrane or 
electrophysiologically silent. This mechanism may account for several 
experimental results previously attributed to presynaptic changes in quantal

Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning, reward typically comes seconds after 
reward-triggering actions, creating an explanatory conundrum known as "distal 
reward problem": How does the brain know what firing patterns of what neurons 
are responsible for the reward if 1) the patterns are no longer there when the 
reward arrives and 2) all neurons and synapses are active during the waiting 
period to the reward? Here, we show how the conundrum is resolved by a model 
network of cortical spiking neurons with spike-timing-dependent plasticity 
(STDP) modulated by dopamine (DA). Although STDP is triggered by nearly 
coincident firing patterns on a millisecond timescale, slow kinetics of 
subsequent synaptic plasticity is sensitive to changes in the extracellular DA 
concentration during the critical period of a few seconds. Random firings during 
the waiting period to the reward do not affect STDP and hence make the network 
insensitive to the ongoing activity-the key feature that distinguishes our 
approach from previous theoretical studies, which implicitly assume that the 
network be quiet during the waiting period or that the patterns be preserved 
until the reward arrives. This study emphasizes the importance of precise firing 
patterns in brain dynamics and suggests how a global diffusive reinforcement 
signal in the form of extracellular DA can selectively influence the right 
synapses at the right time.}, bdsk-url-1  =

{Hormone release from nerve terminals in the neurohypophysis is a sensitive 
function of action potential frequency. We have investigated the cellular 
mechanisms responsible for this frequency-dependent facilitation by combining 
patch clamp and fluorimetric Ca2+ measurements in single neurosecretory 
terminals in thin slices of the rat posterior pituitary. In these terminals both 
action potential-induced changes in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration 
([Ca2+]i) and action potential duration were enhanced by high-frequency stimuli, 
all with a frequency dependence similar to that of hormone release. Furthermore, 
brief voltage clamp pulses inactivated a K+ current with a very similar 
frequency dependence. These results support a model for frequency-dependent 
facilitation in which the inactivation of a K+ current broadens action 
potentials, leading to an enhancement of [Ca2+]i signals. Further experiments 
tested for a causal relationship between action potential broadening and 
facilitation of [Ca2+]i changes. First, increasing the duration of 
depolarization, either by broadening action potentials with the K(+)-channel 
blocker tetraethylammonium or by applying longer depolarizing voltage clamp 
steps, increased [Ca2+]i changes. Second, eliminating frequency-dependent 
changes in duration, by voltage clamping the terminal with constant duration 
pulses, substantially reduced the frequency-dependent enhancement of [Ca2+]i 
changes. These results indicate that action potential broadening contributes to 
frequency-dependent facilitation of [Ca2+]i changes. However, the small residual 
frequency dependence of [Ca2+]i changes seen with constant duration stimulation 
suggests that a second process, distinct from action potential broadening, also 
contributes to facilitation. These two frequency-dependent mechanisms may also 
contribute to activity-dependent plasticity in synaptic terminals.}, institution

  Abstract                 = {1. Two ligand binding alpha subunits, alpha1 and 
alpha2, of the human (H) glycine receptor (GlyR) are involved at inhibitory 
synapses in the adult and neonatal spinal cord, respectively. The ability of 
homomeric alphaH1 and alphaH2 GlyRs to be activated by glycine, taurine and GABA 
was studied in Xenopus oocytes or in the human embryonic kidney HEK-293 cell 
line. 2. In outside-out patches from HEK cells, glycine, taurine and GABA 
activated both GlyRs with the same main unitary conductance, i.e. 85 +/- 3 pS (n 
= 6) for alphaH1, and 95 +/- 5 pS (n = 4) for alphaH2. 3. The sensitivity of 
both alphaH1 and alphaH2 GlyRs to glycine was highly variable. In Xenopus 
oocytes the EC50 for glycine (EC50gly) was between 25 and 280 microM for alphaH1 
(n = 44) and between 46 and 541 microM for alphaH2 (n = 52). For both receptors, 
the highest EC50gly values were found on cells with low maximal glycine 
responses. 4. The actions of taurine and GABA were dependent on the EC50gly: (i) 
their EC50 values were linearly correlated to EC50gly, with EC50tau 
approximately 10 EC50gly and EC50GABA approximately 500-800 EC50gly; (ii) they 
could act either as full or weak agonists depending on the EC50gly. 5. The Hill 
coefficient (n(H)) of glycine remained stable regardless of the EC50gly whereas 
n(H) for taurine decreased with increasing EC50tau. 6. The degree of 
desensitization, evaluated by fast application of saturating concentrations of 
agonist on outside-out patches from Xenopus oocytes, was similar for glycine and 
taurine on both GlyRs and did not exceed 50 \%. 7. Our data concerning the 
variations of EC50gly and the subsequent behaviour of taurine and GABA could be 
qualitatively described by the simple del Castillo-Katz scheme, assuming that 
the agonist gating constant varies whereas the binding constants are stable. 
However, the stability of the Hill coefficient for glycine was not explained by 
this model, suggesting that other mechanisms are involved in the modulation of 
EC50.}, Institution              = {Laboratoire de Biologie Cellulaire et

assessing iodized oil uptake with cone-beam computed tomography (CT) in 
transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 
METHODS: Cone-beam CT provided by a biplane flat-panel detector angiography 
suite was performed on eighteen patients (sixteen men and two women; 41-76 
years; mean age, 58.9 years) directly after TACE for small HCC (26 nodules under 
30 mm; mean diameter, 11.9 mm; range, 5-28 mm). The pre-procedural locations of 
the tumors were evaluated using triphasic multi-detector row helical computed 
tomography (MDCT). The tumor locations on MDCT and the iodized oil uptake by the 
tumors were analyzed on cone-beam CT and on spot image directly after the 
procedures. RESULTS: All lesions on preprocedural MDCT were detected using 
iodized oil uptake in the lesions on cone-beam CT (sensitivity 100\%, 26/26). 
Spot image depicted iodized oil uptake in 22 of the lesions (sensitivity 85\%). 
The degree of iodized oil uptake was overestimated (9\%, 2/22) or underestimated 
(14\%, 3/22) on spot image in five nodules compared with that of cone-beam CT. 
CONCLUSION: Cone-beam CT is a useful and convenient tool for assessing the 
iodized oil uptake of small hepatic tumors (< 3 cm) directly after TACE.},

characteristics of the synaptic input that cortical neurons receive to generate 
their output firing pattern remain unclear. Here we report a novel approach for 
the visualization and functional mapping of sensory inputs to the dendrites of 
cortical neurons in vivo. By combining high-speed two-photon imaging with 
electrophysiological recordings, we identify local subthreshold calcium signals 
that correspond to orientation-specific synaptic inputs. We find that even 
inputs that share the same orientation preference are widely distributed 
throughout the dendritic tree. At the same time, inputs of different orientation 
preference are interspersed, so that adjacent dendritic segments are tuned to 
distinct orientations. Thus, orientation-tuned neurons can compute their 
characteristic firing pattern by integrating spatially distributed synaptic 
inputs coding for multiple stimulus orientations.}, bdsk-url-1  =

these arbors are highly distributed with no regularly arranged patchy 
concentrations like those associated with the columnar organization in other 
primary sensory areas (i.e., where periodically arranged sets of cells have 
common response properties, inputs, and outputs). A lack of columnar 
organization was also indicated by a marked disparity in the intrinsic 
projection patterns of neighboring injected cells. Analysis of axonal branching 
patterns, bouton distributions, and dendritic arbors suggested that each 
pyramidal cell makes a small number of synaptic contacts on a large number 
(>1000) of other cells in piriform cortex at disparate locations. Axons from 
individual pyramidal cells also arborize extensively within many neighboring 
cortical areas, most of which send strong projections back to piriform cortex. 
These include areas involved in high-order functions in prefrontal, amygdaloid, 
entorhinal, and perirhinal cortex, to which there are few projections from other 
primary sensory areas. Our results suggest that piriform cortex performs 
correlative functions analogous to those in association areas of neocortex

traditionally classed. Findings from other studies suggest that the olfactory

Excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were recorded in CA3 pyramidal cells of 
hippocampal slices of 15- to 24-day-old rats (22 degrees C) using the whole-cell 
configuration of the patch clamp technique. 2. Composite EPSCs were evoked by 
extracellular stimulation of the mossy fibre tract. Using the selective blockers 
6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) and D-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic 
acid (APV), a major alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate 
(AMPA)/kainate receptor-mediated component and a minor NMDA receptor-mediated 
component with slower time course were distinguished. For the AMPA/kainate 
receptor-mediated component, the peak current-voltage (I-V) relation was linear, 
with a reversal potential close to 0 mV. The half-maximal blocking concentration 
of CNQX was 353 nM. 3. Unitary EPSCs of the mossy fibre terminal (MF)-CA3 
pyramidal cell synapse were evoked at membrane potentials of -70 to -90 mV by 
low-intensity extracellular stimulation of granule cell somata using fine-tipped 
pipettes. The EPSC peak amplitude as a function of stimulus intensity showed 
all-or-none behaviour. The region of low threshold was restricted to a few 
micrometres. This suggests that extracellular stimulation was focal, and that 
the stimulus-evoked EPSCs were unitary. 4. Latency and rise time histograms of 
EPSCs evoked by granule cell stimulation showed narrow unimodal distributions 
within each experiment. The mean latency was 4.2 +/- 1.0 ms, and the mean 
20-80\% rise time was 0.6 +/- 0.1 ms (23 cells). When fitted within the range 
0.7 ms to 20 ms after the peak, the decay of the EPSCs with the fastest rise 
(rise time 0.5 ms or less) could be described by a single exponential function; 
the mean time constant was in the range 3.0-6.6 ms with a mean of 4.8 ms (8 
cells). 5. Peak amplitudes of the EPSCs evoked by suprathreshold granule cell 
stimulation fluctuated between trials. The apparent EPSC peak conductance in 
normal extracellular solution (2 mM Ca2+, 1 mM Mg2+), excluding failures, was 1 
nS. Reducing the Ca2+ concentration and increasing the Mg2+ concentration 
reduced the mean peak amplitude in a concentration-dependent manner. 6. Peaks in 
EPSC peak amplitude distributions were apparent in low Ca2+ and high Mg2+. Using 
the criteria of equidistance and the presence of peaks and dips in the 
autocorrelation function, five of nine EPSC peak amplitude distributions were

  Abstract                 = {During early postnatal development of auditory 
synapses, the decay time course of AMPA receptor (AMPAR) EPSCs accelerates 
markedly, but the mechanisms underlying this process remain uncertain. Using the 
developing calyx of Held synapse in the mouse auditory brainstem, we have 
examined presynaptic and postsynaptic elements that may regulate decay kinetics 
of AMPAR EPSCs. We found that the decay time kinetics was voltage dependent in 
both immature and mature synapses, being slower at positive potentials than 
negative potentials. By recording evoked miniature events in extracellular Ca2+ 
or Sr2+, we revealed a significant decrease in decay time constants of EPSCs as 
maturation progresses. On the basis of internal and external polyamine block of 
AMPAR EPSCs and immunohistochemistry assays with subunit-specific antibodies, we 
demonstrated that the glutamate receptor (GluR) 2 subunit is virtually absent at 
all developmental ages. Antibody staining patterns suggest a gradual shift in 
subunit composition from GluR1- to GluR3/4-dominant phenotypes. Kinetic analyses 
of deactivation, desensitization, and recovery from desensitization in 
outside-out patches in response to ultrafast application of glutamate lend 
supportive evidence that such a shift in the gating phenotype likely accounts 
for the accelerated time course throughout development. Finally, by 
pharmacologically manipulating AMPAR gating and using simulated EPSCs to evoke 
action potentials, we demonstrated that rapid decay kinetics of AMPAR EPSCs is 
essential for this synapse to accommodate high-frequency firing without 
compromising spike amplitude. Hence, developmental alterations in the subunit 
composition likely dictate changes in the time course of AMPAR EPSCs and play an 
indispensable role in the refinement of high-fidelity neurotransmission at the 
calyx of Held synapse.}, Bdsk-url-1               =

of the excised lesions were diagnosed as malignant. Univariate analysis showed 
that those that were palpable on physical examination, detected as a mass on 
mammography, or >1 cm on sonography were significantly associated with 
malignancy. In multivariate analysis, lesions that were palpable (odds ratio

We describe an attractor network model of area CA3 in which local, recurrent, 
excitatory, and inhibitory interactions generate appropriate place cell 
representations from location- and direction-specific activity in the entorhinal 
cortex. In the model, familiarity with the environment, as reflected by activity 
in neuromodulatory systems, influences the efficacy and plasticity of the 
recurrent and feedforward inputs to CA3. In unfamiliar, novel, environments, 
mossy fiber inputs impose activity patterns on CA3, and the recurrent 
collaterals and the perforant path inputs are subject to graded Hebbian 
plasticity. This sculpts CA3 attractors and associates them with activity 
patterns in the entorhinal cortex. In familiar environments, place fields are 
controlled by the way that perforant path inputs select among the attractors. 
Depending on the training experience provided, the model generates place fields 
that are either directional or nondirectional and whose changes when the 
environment undergoes simple geometric transformations are in accordance with 
experimental data. Representations of multiple environments can be stored and 
recalled with little interference, and these have the appropriate degrees of

      = {e8062}, abstract    = {BACKGROUND: Synaptic plasticity underlies many 
aspect of learning memory and development. The properties of synaptic plasticity 
can change as a function of previous plasticity and previous activation of 
synapses, a phenomenon called metaplasticity. Synaptic plasticity not only 
changes the functional connectivity between neurons but in some cases produces a 
structural change in synaptic spines; a change thought to form a basis for this 
observed plasticity. Here we examine to what extent structural plasticity of 
spines can be a cause for metaplasticity. This study is motivated by the 
observation that structural changes in spines are likely to affect the calcium 
dynamics in spines. Since calcium dynamics determine the sign and magnitude of 
synaptic plasticity, it is likely that structural plasticity will alter the 
properties of synaptic plasticity. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study 
we address the question how spine geometry and alterations of 
N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors conductance may affect plasticity. 
Based on a simplified model of the spine in combination with a calcium-dependent 
plasticity rule, we demonstrated that after the induction phase of plasticity a 
shift of the long term potentiation (LTP) or long term depression (LTD) 
threshold takes place. This induces a refractory period for further LTP 
induction and promotes depotentiation as observed experimentally. That resembles 
the BCM metaplasticity rule but specific for the individual synapse. In the 
second phase, alteration of the NMDA response may bring the synapse to a state 
such that further synaptic weight alterations are feasible. We show that if the 
enhancement of the NMDA response is proportional to the area of the post 
synaptic density (PSD) the plasticity curves most likely return to the initial 
state. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Using simulations of calcium dynamics in 
synaptic spines, coupled with a biophysically motivated calcium-dependent 
plasticity rule, we find under what conditions structural plasticity can form 
the basis of synapse specific metaplasticity.}, bdsk-url-1  =

  Abstract                 = {The time course of Mg(2+) block and unblock of 
NMDA receptors (NMDARs) determines the extent they are activated by 
depolarization. Here, we directly measure the rate of NMDAR channel opening in 
response to depolarizations at different times after brief (1 ms) and sustained 
(4.6 s) applications of glutamate to nucleated patches from neocortical 
pyramidal neurons. The kinetics of Mg(2+) unblock were found to be 
non-instantaneous and complex, consisting of a prominent fast component (time 
constant approximately 100 micros) and slower components (time constants 4 and 
approximately 300 ms), the relative amplitudes of which depended on the timing 
of the depolarizing pulse. Fitting a kinetic model to these data indicated that 
Mg(2+) not only blocks the NMDAR channel, but reduces both the open probability 
and affinity for glutamate, while enhancing desensitization. These effects slow 
the rate of NMDAR channel opening in response to depolarization in a 
time-dependent manner such that the slower components of Mg(2+) unblock are 
enhanced during depolarizations at later times after glutamate application. One 
physiological consequence of this is that brief depolarizations occurring 
earlier in time after glutamate application are better able to open NMDAR 
channels. This finding has important implications for spike-timing-dependent 
synaptic plasticity (STDP), where the precise (millisecond) timing of action 
potentials relative to synaptic inputs determines the magnitude and sign of 
changes in synaptic strength. Indeed, we find that STDP timing curves of NMDAR 
channel activation elicited by realistic dendritic action potential waveforms 
are narrower than expected assuming instantaneous Mg(2+) unblock, indicating 
that slow Mg(2+) unblock of NMDAR channels makes the STDP timing window more

their synaptic connections has been shown to depend on the relative timing of 
pre- and postsynaptic action potentials. This form of synaptic plasticity, 
called spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), has become an attractive model 
for learning at the single-cell level. Yet, despite its popularity in 
experimental and theoretical neuroscience, the influence of dendritic mechanisms 
in the induction of STDP has been largely overlooked. Several recent studies 
have investigated how active dendritic properties and synapse location within 
the dendritic tree influence STDP. These studies suggest the existence of 
learning rules that depend on firing mode and subcellular input location, adding

hormones that act synergistically with auxin to regulate a variety of plant

biochemical studies have revealed a linear signaling pathway that relies on 
protein phosphorylation to transmit the BR signal into the nucleus, altering 
expression of hundreds of genes to promote plant growth. We conducted an 
activation-tagging based suppressor screen to look for Arabidopsis genes that, 
when overexpressed by inserted 35S enhancer elements, could suppress the dwarf 
phenotype of a weak BR receptor mutant bri1-301. This screen identified a total 
of six dominant activation-tagged bri1 suppressors (atbs-Ds). Using a plasmid 
rescue approach, we discovered that the bri1-301 suppression effect in four 
atbs-D mutants (atbs3-D to atbs6-D) was caused by overexpression of a YUCCA gene 
thought to be involved in tryptophan-dependent auxin biosynthesis. 
Interestingly, the three activation-tagged YUCCA genes belong to the YUCCA IIA 
subfamily that includes two other members out of 11 known Arabidopsis YUCCA 
genes. In addition, our molecular studies revealed a T-DNA insertion near a 
basic helix-loop-helix gene in atbs1-D and a T-DNA insertion in a region 
carrying a BR biosynthetic gene in atbs2-D. Further studies of these atbs-D 
mutants could lead to better understanding of the BR signaling process and the

changes in synaptic efficacy are thought to underlie the formation of learning 
and memory in the brain. High-frequency activation of an afferent excitatory 
fibre system can induce long-term potentiation, and conjunctive activation of 
two distinct excitatory synaptic inputs to the cerebellar Purkinje cells can 
lead to long-term depression of the synaptic activity of one of the inputs. Here 
we report a new form of neural plasticity in which activation of an excitatory 
synaptic input can induce a potentiation of inhibitory synaptic signals to the 
same cell. In cerebellar Purkinje cells stimulation of the excitatory climbing 
fibre synapses is followed by a long-lasting (up to 75 min) potentiation of 
gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic 
currents (i.p.s.cs), a phenomenon that we term rebound potentiation. Using 
whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in combination with fluorometric video imaging 
of intracellular calcium ion concentration, we find that a climbing 
fibre-induced transient increase in postsynaptic calcium concentration triggers 
the induction of rebound potentiation. Because the response of Purkinje cells to 
bath-applied exogenous GABA is also potentiated after climbing fibre-stimulation 
with a time course similar to that of the rebound potentiation of i.p.s.cs, we 
conclude that the potentiation is caused by a calcium-dependent upregulation of 
postsynaptic GABAA receptor function. We propose that rebound potentiation is a 
mechanism by which in vivo block of climbing fibre activity induces an increase 
in excitability in Purkinje cells. Moreover, rebound potentiation of i.p.s.cs is 
a cellular mechanism which, in addition to the long-term depression of parallel 
fibre synaptic activity, may have an important role for motor learning in the 
cerebellum.}, bdsk-url-1  = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/356601a0}, doi         =

homeostatic plasticity at multiple synaptic and cellular loci. Though individual 
types of plasticity are normally examined in isolation, it is their interactions 
and net effect that will ultimately determine their functional consequences. 
Here we examine homeostatic plasticity of both inhibition and intrinsic 
excitability in parallel in rat organotypic hippocampal slices. As previous 
studies have not examined inhibitory plasticity using a functional measure, 
inhibition was measured by the ability of evoked inhibitory postsynaptic 
potentials (IPSPs) to suppress action potentials, as well as IPSP amplitude. We 
show that manipulations of network activity can both up- and downregulate 
functional inhibition, as well as intrinsic excitability. However, these forms 
of plasticity are dissociable. Specifically, robust changes in intrinsic 
excitability were observed in the absence of inhibitory plasticity, and shifts 
in inhibition, but not excitability, appear to be sensitive to developmental 
stage. Our data establish that while the two forms of homeostatic plasticity can 
be engaged in parallel, there is a specific order in which they are expressed, 
with changes in excitability preceding those in inhibition. We propose that 
changes in intrinsic excitability occur first in order to stabilize network 
activity while optimizing the preservation of information stored in synaptic 
strengths by restricting changes that will disrupt the balance of synaptic 
excitation and inhibition.},

expressed in the Gestalt law of good continuation, human perception tends to 
associate stimuli that form smooth continuations. Contextual modulation in 
primary visual cortex, in the form of association fields, is believed to play an 
important role in this process. Yet a unified and principled account of the good 
continuation law on the neural level is lacking. In this study we introduce a 
population model of primary visual cortex. Its contextual interactions depend on 
the elastica curvature energy of the smoothest contour connecting oriented bars. 
As expected, this model leads to association fields consistent with data. 
However, in addition the model displays tilt-illusions for stimulus 
configurations with grating and single bars that closely match psychophysics. 
Furthermore, the model explains not only pop-out of contours amid a variety of 
backgrounds, but also pop-out of single targets amid a uniform background. We 
thus propose that elastica is a unifying principle of the visual cortical 
network.}, bdsk-url-1  = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.visres.2015.05.021}, doi

{Excitatory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system (CNS) is 
mediated by three major classes of glutamate receptors, namely the ionotropic 
NMDA (N-Methyl-D-Aspartate) and KA/AMPA 
(kainate/alpha-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid) receptors 
and the metabotropic receptor type. Among the ionotropic receptors, NMDA 
receptors are thought to mediate their physiological response mainly through the 
influx of extracellular calcium, while KA/AMPA receptor channels are mainly 
thought to carry the influx of monovalent cations. Recently, we have challenged 
this view by showing that cloned KA/AMPA receptor subunits GluR1 and GluR3 form 
ion channels which are permeable to calcium. We now directly demonstrate large 
increases in intracellular calcium concentrations induced by calcium fluxes 
through KA/AMPA receptor channels in solutions with physiological calcium 
concentrations. Calcium fluxes were observed through glutamate receptor channels 
composed of the subunits GluR1 and GluR3, which are both abundantly present in 
various types of central neurones. The calcium influx was fluorometrically 
monitored in Xenopus oocytes injected with the calcium indicator dye fura-2. 
Bath application of the membrane permeable analogue of adenosine cyclic 
monophosphate (cAMP) potentiated the current and also the flux of calcium 
through open KA/AMPA receptor channels. Further pharmacological experiments 
suggested that this effect was mediated by the activation of protein kinase A. 
Our results provide a molecular interpretation for the function of calcium 
permeable KA/AMPA receptor channels in neurones and identify two of the subunits 
of the KA/AMPA receptor channel which are regulated by the cAMP dependent second 
messenger system.}, institution = {Max Planck Institut f?r biophysikalische

Excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and their underlying currents (EPSCs) 
were recorded from dentate granule cells in thin hippocampal slices of rats 
using the tight-seal whole-cell recording technique. 2. At resting membrane 
potentials (ca -60 to -70 mV), the EPSCs clearly consisted of a dominant fast 
and a smaller slow component. The slow EPSC component markedly increased with 
depolarization. This resulted in a region of negative slope conductance (between 
-50 and -30 mV) in the peak current-voltage (I-V) relation of the dual-component 
EPSC in most neurones. The EPSCs reversed entirely at -1.2 +/- 2.8 mV (n = 15). 
3. Using selective antagonists of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and non-NMDA 
excitatory amino acid receptors, two pharmacologically distinct components of 
the natural EPSCs were isolated. The non-NMDA EPSCs displayed a linear I-V 
relation. Their rise times (0.5-1.9 ms) were independent of membrane voltage but 
seemed to depend critically on the precise dendritic location of the synapse. 
Their decay was approximated by a single exponential with a time constant 
ranging from 3 to 9 ms. The time course of these EPSCs was independent of 
changes in extracellular Mg2+. 4. The NMDA EPSCs displayed a non-linear I-V 
relation. At resting membrane potentials their peak amplitudes were 20 pA and 
increased steadily with depolarization to -30 mV. At membrane voltages positive 
to -30 mV the peak I-V relation was linear. The rise times of NMDA EPSCs ranged 
from 4 to 9 ms and were insensitive to membrane voltage. 5. The NMDA EPSCs 
decayed biexponentially. Both time constants, tau f and tau s, increased with 
depolarization in an exponential manner, tau s being more voltage dependent than 
tau f. Lowering extracellular Mg2+ slightly reduced both rate constants but did 
not completely abolish their voltage sensitivity. 6. Bath application of NMDA to 
outside-out patches from granule cells induced single channel currents of 52 pS 
in nominally Mg(2+)-free solutions. They displayed a burst-like single-channel 
activity with clusters of bursts lasting several hundreds of milliseconds. 
Currents through single NMDA receptor channels reversed around 0 mV. 7. The 
fractional contributions of NMDA and non-NMDA components to peak currents and 
synaptic charge transfer were assessed. At resting membrane potential the NMDA 
EPSC component accounted for 23\% of the peak current and for 64\% of the 
synaptic charge transfer. The contribution of the NMDA EPSC component to the 
synaptic charge transfer strongly increased with small depolarizations from 
rest.}, institution = {Max-Planck-Institut f?r biophysikalische Chemie,

changes are triggered by presynaptic spikes, postsynaptic spikes, and the time 
differences between presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes. The changes due to 
correlated input and output spikes are quantified by means of a learning window. 
We show that plasticity can lead to an intrinsic stabilization of the mean 
firing rate of the postsynaptic neuron. Subtractive normalization of the 
synaptic weights (summed over all presynaptic inputs converging on a 
postsynaptic neuron) follows if, in addition, the mean input rates and the mean 
input correlations are identical at all synapses. If the integral over the 
learning window is positive, firing-rate stabilization requires a non-Hebbian 
component, whereas such a component is not needed if the integral of the 
learning window is negative. A negative integral corresponds to anti-Hebbian 
learning in a model with slowly varying firing rates. For spike-based learning, 
a strict distinction between Hebbian and anti-Hebbian rules is questionable 
since learning is driven by correlations on the timescale of the learning 
window. The correlations between presynaptic and postsynaptic firing are 
evaluated for a piecewise-linear Poisson model and for a noisy spiking neuron 
model with refractoriness. While a negative integral over the learning window 
leads to intrinsic rate stabilization, the positive part of the learning window 
picks up spatial and temporal correlations in the input.}, bdsk-url-1  =

framework relating key brain regions in medial temporal lobe (MTL) and medial

represented in neocortex. An important aspect of this framework is the 
efficiency of learning enabled by congruency-dependent MTL-mPFC interactions.},

OS were 6.5 months (95\% CI, 4.9-8.4) and 11.8 months (95\% CI, 6.7-16.8), 
respectively. The most common toxicities of all grades were anemia (81.8\% of 
patients), asthenia (81.8\%), anorexia (79.6\%), hand-foot syndrome (79.6\%), 
acneiform skin eruption (77.2\%), and sensory neuropathy (75.0\%), and they were 
mostly grade 1 or 2. Grade 3-4 hematologic toxicities were uncommon (anemia, 
6.8\%; thrombocytopenia, 2.3\%). Conclusions Cetuximab in combination with XELOX 
chemotherapy was active and safe as first-line treatment of metastatic and/or 
recurrent AGC patients.}, bdsk-url-1  =

-radiation-induced apoptosis. However, it is unclear how JNK activation and 
gamma -radiation-dependent RhoB induction are related. Here we verified the 
relationship between JNK activation and RhoB induction. RhoB induction by gamma 
-radiation occurred at the transcriptional level and transcriptional activation 
of RhoB was concomitant with an increase in RhoB protein. gamma 
-radiation-induced RhoB expression was markedly attenuated by pretreatment with 
a JNK-specific inhibitor, SP600125, but not by a p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580. 
Inhibition of JNK caused a decrease in early apoptotic cell death that 
correlated with RhoB expression. However, PI3K inhibition had no significant 
effects, indicating that the AKT survival pathway was not involved. The siRNA 
knockdown of JNK resulted in a decrease in RhoB expression and the siRNA 
knockdown of RhoB restored cell growth even in the gamma -irradiated cells. 
These results suggest that RhoB regulation involves the JNK pathway and 
contributes to the early apoptotic response of Jurkat T cells to gamma 
-radiation.}, bdsk-url-1  = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.12.012}, doi

neurons often have correlated trial-to-trial response variability, and a 
significant fraction of their spikes occur synchronously. These two forms of 
correlation are both believed to arise from common synaptic input, but the 
origin of this input is unclear. We investigated the source of correlated 
responsivity by recording from pairs of single neurons in primary visual cortex 
of anesthetized macaque monkeys and comparing correlated variability and 
synchrony for spontaneous activity and activity evoked by stimuli of different 
orientations and contrasts. These two stimulus manipulations would be expected 
to have different effects on the cortical pool providing input to the recorded 
pair: changing stimulus orientation should recruit different populations of 
cells, whereas changing stimulus contrast affects primarily the relative 
strength of sensory drive and ongoing cortical activity. Consistent with this 
predicted difference, we found that correlation was affected by these stimulus 
manipulations in different ways. Synchrony was significantly stronger for 
orientations that drove both neurons well than for those that did not, but 
correlation on longer time scales was orientation independent. Reducing stimulus 
contrast resulted in a decrease in the temporal precision of synchronous firing 
and an enhancement of correlated response variability on longer time scales. Our 
results thus suggest that correlated responsivity arises from mechanisms 
operating at two distinct timescales: one that is orientation tuned and that 
determines the strength of temporally precise synchrony, and a second that is 
contrast sensitive, of low temporal frequency, and present in ongoing cortical 
activity.}, bdsk-url-1  = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5106-04.2005},

gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor channels were resolved by using 
tight-seal, whole-cell recordings from granule cells of the dentate gyrus in 
adult rat hippocampal slices and by applying the technique of nonstationary 
noise analysis to study miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) 
recorded in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX), 
6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX), and D-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric 
acid (D-AP5). This technique allowed us to extract information about the 
conductance, the number, and the kinetics of ligand gated channels underlying 
elementary synaptic currents. 2. To ascertain the validity of the nonstationary 
noise analysis method we have first tested it on computer simulated mIPSCs with 
different channel activation, lifetime kinetics, and opening probabilities. 
Using intraburst mean open times, shorter than the time to the first opening 
following activation, caused a large variance at the peak due to the stochastic 
channel properties. This resulted in a skewed mean current-variance 
relationship, which precluded proper estimation of unit conductance and 
especially the number of channels open at the peak of mIPSCs. Regardless of the 
probability of channel opening, accurate estimates of the unit conductance and 
the number of channels underlying each simulated mIPSC were obtained when 
channels had mean open times longer than the time to first opening. 3. Once the 
validity of the nonstationary analysis had been ascertained, it was used on 
mIPSCs recorded at 35 degrees C. The unit conductance of the synaptic GABAA 
channels was 28 +/- 1 (SE) pS and the average number of channels underlying 
mIPSCs was 46 +/- 4. The mean current-variance relationship was not skewed at 
higher amplitudes, suggesting that the intrinsic variance at the peak of the 
GABAA mIPSCs is low and that the open time of the channels is longer than the 
time to first opening. The estimated unit conductance of the channels was 
constant over a wide range of holding potentials. 4. The amplitude distribution 
of mIPSCs with rapid 10-90\% rise times (290 +/- 20 microseconds) was clearly 
skewed towards low values. This skew was not due to filtering of 
electrotonically distant currents. Current-variance analysis revealed that the 
skewness resulted from differences in the number of GABAA receptor channels and 
not from the heterogeneity of unitary conductances at various synapses. 
Selection of mIPSCs with slower rise times yielded smaller unit conductance 
estimates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)}, institution = {Department of

Nevertheless, repetitive stimulation of afferent fibers still resulted in

effects of drugs on presynaptic endings. We found that iontophoretic application

activity induced in rat hippocampal slices by lowering extracellular Ca2+ 
concentration ([Ca2+]o) was studied with extracellular and intracellular 
recordings. Perfusing the slices with low Ca2+ (less than or equal to 0.2 mM) or 
EGTA-containing solutions blocked the synaptic responses of hippocampal 
pyramidal cells (HPCs). Despite the block, spontaneous paroxysms, termed 
seizurelike events (SLEs), appeared in the CA1 area and then recurred regularly 
at a stable frequency. Transient hypoxia accelerated their development and 
increased their frequency. When [Ca2+]o was raised in a stepwise manner, the 
SLEs disappeared at 0.3 mM. With extracellular recording from the CA1 stratum 
pyramidale, a SLE was characterized by a large negative shift in the field 
potential, which lasted for several seconds. During this period a large 
population of CA1 neurons discharged intensely and often in synchrony, as 
concluded from the frequent appearance of population spikes. Synchronization, 
however, was not a necessary precursor for the development of paroxysmal 
activity, but seemed to be the end result of massive neuronal excitation. The 
cellular counterpart of a SLE, as revealed by intracellular recording from HPCs 
in the discharge zone of the paroxysms, was a long-lasting depolarization shift 
(LDS) of up to 20 mV. This was accompanied by accelerated firing of the neuron. 
A prolonged after-hyperpolarization succeeded each LDS and arrested cell firing. 
Brief (approximately 50 ms) bursts were commonly observed before LDS onset. 
Single electrical stimuli applied focally to the stratum pyramidale or alveus 
evoked paroxysms identical to the spontaneous SLEs, provided they surpassed a 
critical threshold intensity. Subthreshold stimuli elicited only small local 
responses, whereas stimuli of varied suprathreshold intensities evoked the same 
maximal SLEs. Thus the buildup of a SLE is an all or nothing or a regenerative 
process, which mobilizes the majority, if not all, of the local neuronal 
population. Each SLE was followed by absolute and relative refractory periods 
during which focal stimulation was, respectively, ineffective and less effective 
in evoking a maximal SLE. In most slices the spontaneous SLEs commenced at a 
"focus" located in the CA1a subarea (near the subiculum). SLEs evoked by focal 
stimulation arose near the stimulating electrode. From their site of origin the 
paroxysmal discharges spread transversely through the entire CA1 area at a mean 
velocity of 1.74 mm/s. Consequently, the discharge zone of a SLE could encompass 
for several seconds the entire CA1 area.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Purkinje cells are known to receive strong excitatory input from two major 
pathways originating outside the cerebellum and inhibitory input from two types 
of neurons in the cerebellar cortex. The functions and synaptic strengths of 
these pathways are only partially known. We have used the patch-clamp technique 
applied to Purkinje cells in thin slices of rat cerebellum to measure directly 
the postsynaptic currents arising from the two major excitatory pathways and one 
of the inhibitory inputs. Inhibitory synaptic currents occur spontaneously with 
high frequency and are variable in amplitude, ranging, in our recording 
conditions with high internal Cl-, from less than 100 pA to more than 1 nA. 
These currents are blocked by the gamma-aminobutyrate type A antagonist 
bicuculline. One of the excitatory inputs is all or none. For threshold 
stimulation, the synaptic current is either full amplitude, when the presynaptic 
fiber is successfully stimulated, or completely absent. This synaptic current is 
often larger than 1 nA and is virtually eliminated by 2 microM 
6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, a blocking agent thought to be specific 
for glutamate receptors that are not of the N-methyl-D-aspartate type. Its 
all-or-none character identifies it as arising from a climbing-fiber synapse. 
The other excitatory input produces a synaptic current that is smoothly graded 
as a function of stimulus intensity. This response we believe arises from the 
stimulation of mossy fibers or granule cells. The synaptic current associated 
with this input is also largely eliminated by 2 microM

volume      = {386}, pages       = {603--633}, abstract    = {1. In dissociated 
and cultured 2-5-day-old chick dorsal root ganglion cells, a large transient 
inward current could be activated in response to a 'step' increase in [H+]o. 2. 
Using the single-electrode patch clamp technique in its whole-cell 
configuration, the proton-induced current was graded with [H+]o and relaxed in 
1-2 s. 3. The pH dependence of the current was sigmoid with activation occurring 
at around pH 7.0 (at[Ca2+]o = 1 mM) and a maximum at pH 6.0-5.5. 4. Small 
increases of [H+]o, which by themselves failed to activate a significant amount 
of current, inactivated the proton-induced current. The half-maximum of 
inactivation occurred at pH 7.11 at [Ca2+]o = 5 mM, but this changed to pH 7.32 
at [Ca2+]o = 1 mM. 5. The proton-induced inward current reversed direction at 
the Na+ equilibrium potential and was suppressed in the absence of [Na+]o. 
Measurement of the reversal potential at different [Na+]o and/or [Na+]i showed a 
linear relation with a slope of 58 mV/decade as predicted from the Nernst 
equation. Thus, proton-induced current was carried by Na+ and was abbreviated as 
INa(H). 6. The membrane conductance associated with INa(H) showed no voltage 
dependence, but did change in parallel with the activation of the current. The 
membrane conductance increased by a factor of 10-20-fold at the peak of the 
inward current. 7. INa(H) was blocked by organic and inorganic Ca2+ channel 
blockers (diltiazem, Cd2+ and Ni2+), but was unaffected by high concentrations 
of tetrodotoxin (TTX) or steady-state increases of the [Ca2+]i to 10(-4) M or 
the [H+]i to 10(-6) M. 8. In outside-out membrane patches, the single channel 
associated with the proton-induced current opened in bursts, with long pauses. 
The mean open time during the bursts was 1.26 ms and the channel had a 
conductance of 20-25 pS at -80 mV (120 mM [Na2+]o, 20 mM [Na2+]i). 9. 
Measurement of the voltage-gated Ca2+ current using short (30-50 ms) 
depolarizing pulses to zero showed that the Ca2+ current (ICa) but not the fast 
Na+ current (INa) was completely suppressed during the time course of activation 
of INa(H). 10. INa(H) was completely blocked by high (35-40 mM) [Ca2+]o. 11. 
Simultaneous elevation of [H+]o and [Ca2+]o failed to activate INa(H) but 
enhanced the voltage-gated Ca2+ channel. 12. Our data show that the 
proton-induced current is carried by Na+ flowing through a transformed Ca2+ 
channel.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)}, institution = {Department of

following results support this interpretation: during a train of stimuli the 
depolarizing potentials sum and can exceed 80\% of the initial spike amplitude

cannot have undergone significant depolarization during the train. Optical 
recordings with simultaneous microelectrode recordings from the glial cells

  Abstract                 = {We have examined factors that determine the 
strength and dynamics of GABAergic synapses between interneurons [dentate gyrus 
basket cells (BCs)] and principal neurons [dentate gyrus granule cells (GCs)] 
using paired recordings in rat hippocampal slices at 34 degrees C. Unitary IPSCs 
recorded from BC-GC pairs in high intracellular Cl(-) concentration showed a 
fast rise and a biexponential decay, with mean time constants of 2 and 9 msec. 
The mean quantal conductance change, determined directly at reduced 
extracellular Ca(2+)/Mg(2+) concentration ratios, was 1.7 nS. Quantal release at 
the BC-GC synapse occurred with short delay and was highly synchronized. 
Analysis of IPSC peak amplitudes and numbers of failures by multiple probability 
compound binomial analysis indicated that synaptic transmission at the BC-GC 
synapse involves three to seven release sites, each of which releases 
transmitter with high probability ( approximately 0.5 in 2 mm Ca(2+)/1 mm 
Mg(2+)). Unitary BC-GC IPSCs showed paired-pulse depression (PPD); maximal 
depression, measured for 10 msec intervals, was 37\%, and recovery from 
depression occurred with a time constant of 2 sec. Paired-pulse depression was 
mainly presynaptic in origin but appeared to be independent of previous release. 
Synaptic transmission at the BC-GC synapse showed frequency-dependent 
depression, with half-maximal decrease at 5 Hz after a series of 1000 
presynaptic action potentials. The relative stability of transmission at the 
BC-GC synapse is consistent with a model in which an activity-dependent gating 
mechanism reduces release probability and thereby prevents depletion of the 
releasable pool of synaptic vesicles. Thus several mechanisms converge on the 
generation of powerful and sustained transmission at interneuron-principal 
neuron synapses in hippocampal circuits.}, Institution              =

  Abstract                 = {Exocytosis of a single vesicle has been proposed 
as the mechanism which determines quantal size by releasing a prepackaged and 
standard amount of acetylcholine. As first described by del Castillo and Katz 
(1954) the endplate potential is composed of 100 unitary events and the small 
variance suggests a binomial release from 100 "discrete patches of membrane". 
However, exocytosis of 100 vesicles selected randomly from 5000 docked vesicles 
would yield a variance that is 7 times greater than observed values. We propose 
that the presynaptic ridge with its compliment of docked vesicles functions as 
the "discrete patch of membrane" such that arrays of calcium activated fusion 
pores meter transmitter to form the unit of release. A model based on the 
synchronous flicker of a large number of fusion pores produces the small 
variance of both miniature end plate potentials and unitary end plate 
potentials. Release from a single locus (fusion pore) would generate the 
sub-MEPP. This model permits vesicle trafficking and vesicular content depletion 
during tetanic stimulation and explains the frequency dependency of MEPP 
amplitudes and changes in sub-MEPP to bell-MEPP class ratios.}, Bdsk-url-1

diverse plastic changes in both pre- and postsynaptic elements that restore

activity. However, none of the plasticity currently known involves the AIS. We 
report here that deprivation of auditory input in an avian brainstem auditory 
neuron leads to an increase in AIS length, thus augmenting the excitability of 
the neuron. The length of the AIS, defined by the distribution of voltage-gated 
Na(+) channels and the AIS anchoring protein, increased by 1.7 times in seven 
days after auditory input deprivation. This was accompanied by an increase in 
the whole-cell Na(+) current, membrane excitability and spontaneous firing. Our 
work demonstrates homeostatic regulation of the AIS, which may contribute to the 
maintenance of the auditory pathway after hearing loss. Furthermore, plasticity 
at the spike initiation site suggests a powerful pathway for refining neuronal 
computation in the face of strong sensory deprivation.}, bdsk-url-1  =

  Abstract                 = {Isolated feedforward networks (FFNs) of spiking 
neurons have been studied extensively for their ability to propagate transient 
synchrony and asynchronous firing rates, in the presence of activity independent 
synaptic background noise (Diesmann et al., 1999; van Rossum et al., 2002). In a 
biologically realistic scenario, however, the FFN should be embedded in a 
recurrent network, such that the activity in the FFN and the network activity 
may dynamically interact. Previously, transient synchrony propagating in an FFN 
was found to destabilize the dynamics of the embedding network (Mehring et al., 
2003). Here, we show that by modeling synapses as conductance transients, rather 
than current sources, it is possible to embed and propagate transient synchrony 
in the FFN, without destabilizing the background network dynamics. However, the 
network activity has a strong impact on the type of activity that can be 
propagated in the embedded FFN. Global synchrony and high firing rates in the 
embedding network prohibit the propagation of both, synchronous and asynchronous 
spiking activity. In contrast, asynchronous low-rate network states support the 
propagation of both, synchronous spiking and asynchronous, but only low firing 
rates. In either case, spiking activity tends to synchronize as it propagates, 
challenging the feasibility to transmit information in asynchronous firing 
rates. Finally, asynchronous network activity allows to embed more than one FFN, 
with the amount of cross talk depending on the degree of overlap in the FFNs. 
This opens the possibility of computational mechanisms using transient synchrony 
among the activities in multiple FFNs.}, Bdsk-url-1               =

on layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the developing rat neocortex. Whole-cell 
recordings were made from single neurons and synaptically coupled pairs of 
pyramidal cells, which were filled with biocytin, morphologically reconstructed, 
and quantitatively analyzed. Autapses were found in most neurons (in 80\% of all 
cells analyzed; n = 41). On average, 2.3 +/- 0.9 autapses per neuron were found, 
located primarily on basal dendrites (64\%; 50-70 microns from the soma), to a 
lesser extent on apical oblique dendrites (31\%; 130-200 microns from the soma), 
and rarely on the main apical dendrite (5\% 480-540 microns from the soma). 
About three times more synaptic than autaptic contacts (ratio 2.4:1) were formed 
by a single adjacent synaptically coupled neuron of the same type. The dendritic 
locations of these synapses were remarkably similar to those of autapses. 
Electron microscopic examination of serial ultrathin sections confirmed the 
formation of autapses and synapses, respectively, and showed that both types of 
contacts were located either on dendritic spines or shafts. The similarities 
between autapses and synapses suggest that autaptic and synaptic circuits are 
governed by some common principles of synapse formation.}, institution =

disease (AD) is an extraordinary inability to form new memories. For many years, 
this dementia was attributed to nerve-cell death induced by deposits of 
fibrillar amyloid beta (Abeta). A newer hypothesis has emerged, however, in 
which early memory loss is considered a synapse failure caused by soluble Abeta 
oligomers. Such oligomers rapidly block long-term potentiation, a classic 
experimental paradigm for synaptic plasticity, and they are strikingly elevated 
in AD brain tissue and transgenic-mouse AD models. The current work 
characterizes the manner in which Abeta oligomers attack neurons. Antibodies 
raised against synthetic oligomers applied to AD brain sections were found to 
give diffuse stain around neuronal cell bodies, suggestive of a dendritic 
pattern, whereas soluble brain extracts showed robust AD-dependent reactivity in 
dot immunoblots. Antigens in unfractionated AD extracts attached with 
specificity to cultured rat hippocampal neurons, binding within dendritic arbors 
at discrete puncta. Crude fractionation showed ligand size to be between 10 and 
100 kDa. Synthetic Abeta oligomers of the same size gave identical punctate 
binding, which was highly selective for particular neurons. Image analysis by 
confocal double-label immunofluorescence established that >90\% of the punctate 
oligomer binding sites colocalized with the synaptic marker PSD-95 (postsynaptic 
density protein 95). Synaptic binding was accompanied by ectopic induction of 
Arc, a synaptic immediate-early gene, the overexpression of which has been 
linked to dysfunctional learning. Results suggest the hypothesis that targeting 
and functional disruption of particular synapses by Abeta oligomers may provide 
a molecular basis for the specific loss of memory function in early AD.},

disease (AD) seems likely to involve synaptic damage caused by soluble 
Abeta-derived oligomers (ADDLs). ADDLs have been shown to build up in the brain 
and CSF of AD patients and are known to interfere with mechanisms of synaptic 
plasticity, acting as gain-of-function ligands that attach to synapses. Because 
of the correlation between AD dementia and synaptic degeneration, we 
investigated here the ability of ADDLs to affect synapse composition, structure, 
and abundance. Using highly differentiated cultures of hippocampal neurons, a 
preferred model for studies of synapse cell biology, we found that ADDLs bound 
to neurons with specificity, attaching to presumed excitatory pyramidal neurons 
but not GABAergic neurons. Fractionation of ADDLs bound to forebrain 
synaptosomes showed association with postsynaptic density complexes containing 
NMDA receptors, consistent with observed attachment of ADDLs to dendritic 
spines. During binding to hippocampal neurons, ADDLs promoted a rapid decrease 
in membrane expression of memory-related receptors (NMDA and EphB2). Continued 
exposure resulted in abnormal spine morphology, with induction of long thin 
spines reminiscent of the morphology found in mental retardation, 
deafferentation, and prionoses. Ultimately, ADDLs caused a significant decrease 
in spine density. Synaptic deterioration, which was accompanied by decreased 
levels of the spine cytoskeletal protein drebrin, was blocked by the Alzheimer's 
therapeutic drug Namenda. The observed disruption of dendritic spines links 
ADDLs to a major facet of AD pathology, providing strong evidence that ADDLs in

Riesenhuber and Poggio's model of object recognition. Membrane potential was 
recorded from anesthetized cats while optimally oriented bars were presented, 
either alone or in pairs, in different parts of the cells' receptive field. In 
most cells, the membrane potential response to two bars presented simultaneously 
could not be predicted by the sum of the responses to individual bars. In many 
cells, however, the responses closely approximated a MAX-like model. That is, 
the response of the cell to two bars was similar to the larger of the two 
individual responses ("soft-MAX"). The degree of nonlinear summation varied from 
cell to cell and varied within single cells from one stimulus configuration to 
another but on average fit most closely to the MAX model. The firing response of 
the cells was also well predicted by the MAX-like model. The MAX-like behavior 
was independent of the distance between the bars (orthogonal to the preferred 
orientation), independent of the relative amplitude of the responses, and 
slightly less pronounced at low levels of contrast. This MAX-like behavior of a

input from higher to lower cortical areas arrives at the distal apical tufts of 
pyramidal neurons. Yet, distal inputs are predicted to have much less impact on 
firing than proximal inputs. Here we show that even weak asynchronous dendritic 
input to the distal tuft region can significantly increase the gain of layer 5 
pyramidal neurons and thereby the output of columns in the primary somatosensory 
cortex of the rat. Noisy currents injected in ramps at different dendritic 
locations showed that the initial slope of the frequency-current (f/I) 
relationship increases with the distance of the current injection from the soma. 
The increase was due to the interaction of dendritic depolarization with 
back-propagating APs which activated dendritic calcium conductances. Gain 
increases were accompanied by a change of firing mode from isolated spikes to 
bursting where the timing of bursts coded the presence of coincident somatic and 
dendritic inputs. We propose that this dendritic gain modulation and the timing 
of bursts may serve to associate top-down and bottom-up input on different time 
scales.}, bdsk-url-1  = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhh065}, doi         =

hippocampus of anesthetized rats and simultaneously detected layer-specific 
gamma oscillations using current-source-density analysis. Spike timing of basket 
cells tuned the phase and amplitude of gamma oscillations generated around 
stratum pyramidale, where basket cells selectively innervate pyramidal cells 
with GABAergic synapses. Basket cells did not contribute to gamma oscillations 
generated at the apical tuft of pyramidal cells. This gamma oscillation was 
selectively modulated by a subset of local GABAergic interneurons and by medial 
entorhinal cortex layer 3 neurons. The generation of independent and 
layer-specific gamma oscillations, implemented onto hippocampal pyramidal cells 
along their somato-dendritic axis, can be explained by selective axonal 
targeting and precisely controlled temporal firing of GABAergic interneurons.},

In the neocortex, a range of different plasticity mechanisms are shaping 
recurrent networks into effective information processing circuits that learn 
appropriate representations for time-varying sensory stimuli. However, it has 
been difficult to mimic these abilities in artificial neural network models. 
Here we introduce SORN, a self-organizing recurrent network. It combines three 
distinct forms of local plasticity to learn spatio-temporal patterns in its 
input while maintaining its dynamics in a healthy regime suitable for learning. 
The SORN learns to encode information in the form of trajectories through its 
high-dimensional state space reminiscent of recent biological findings on 
cortical coding. All three forms of plasticity are shown to be essential for the 
network's success.}, bdsk-url-1  =

governing changes in synaptic strength during spike timing-dependent synaptic 
plasticity (STDP) have paid little attention to the fact that synaptic inputs 
are distributed across complex dendritic trees. During STDP, propagation of 
action potentials (APs) back to the site of synaptic input is thought to trigger 
plasticity. However, in pyramidal neurons, backpropagation of single APs is 
decremental, whereas high-frequency bursts lead to generation of distal 
dendritic calcium spikes. This raises the question whether STDP learning rules 
depend on synapse location and firing mode. Here, we investigate this issue at 
synapses between layer 2/3 and layer 5 pyramidal neurons in somatosensory 
cortex. We find that low-frequency pairing of single APs at positive times leads 
to a distance-dependent shift to long-term depression (LTD) at distal inputs. At 
proximal sites, this LTD could be converted to long-term potentiation (LTP) by 
dendritic depolarizations suprathreshold for BAC-firing or by high-frequency AP 
bursts. During AP bursts, we observed a progressive, distance-dependent shift in 
the timing requirements for induction of LTP and LTD, such that distal synapses 
display novel timing rules: they potentiate when inputs are activated after 
burst onset (negative timing) but depress when activated before burst onset 
(positive timing). These findings could be explained by distance-dependent 
differences in the underlying dendritic voltage waveforms driving NMDA receptor 
activation during STDP induction. Our results suggest that synapse location 
within the dendritic tree is a crucial determinant of STDP, and that synapses 
undergo plasticity according to local rather than global learning rules.},

The spatial extent over which neurons in macaque striate cortex pool visual 
signals JONATHAN B. LEVITT1 and JENNIFER S. LUND2 1Department of Biology, City 
College of the City University of New York, New York 2Department of 
Ophthalmology, Moran Eye Center, University of Utah, Salt Lake City (Received 
December 6, 2001; Accepted June 11, 2002) Abstract We recorded activity of 
single units in macaque monkey primary visual cortex (V1) to define the 
retinotopic extent of the visual inputs that drive or modulate V1 neuron 
responses in parafoveal and peripheral (calcarine) cortex. We used high-contrast 
drifting grating stimuli to define the extent of the area over which responses 
summate and the extent of the receptive-field surround. We found responses of 
most V1 cells to summate over 1 deg, with a suppressive surround typically twice 
that in diameter, though for some cells (even in parafoveal V1) surrounds 
exceeded 13 deg in diameter. Surprisingly, we found no significant laminar 
differences in these dimensions or in the strength of surround suppression. We 
found that surround suppression in most cells arises from both the ends and 
sides of the receptive field. Our measures indicate that the strongest 
modulatory input arises from regions immediately adjacent to the excitatory 
summation area. These physiological measures suggest that the high-contrast 
summation field of V1 neurons can be accounted for by the sum of lateral 
geniculate nucleus (LGN) inputs offered to the local cortical column, with 
monosynaptic lateral connections within area V1 adding the larger dimensions of 
the low-contrast summation field and the near surround. Neither of these inputs 
suffice to explain the largest surrounds, which most likely derive from feedback 
from extrastriate visual areas. Keywords: Visual cortex, Electrophysiology, 
Receptive field, Surround, Primate Introduction responses can be modulated over

Intraperitoneal injection of LPS in the presence or absence of previous TLR4

incidences of preterm delivery and fetal death were calculated. Flow cytometry 
was performed to examine the percentages of blood CD45(+)CD86(+), CD3(+)CD69(+),

this tolerance reshaping can be induced under naturally occurring dynamic visual

synaptic modification remains elusive, partly because our knowledge of central 
synapses is still limited. One proposal is that the modification is 
postsynaptic, and that synapses expressing only NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) 
receptors before potentiation are induced by LTP to express functional AMPA 
(alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionate) receptors. Here we 
report that a high proportion of synapses in hippocampal area CA1 transmit with 
NMDA receptors but not AMPA receptors, making these synapses effectively 
non-functional at normal resting potentials. These silent synapses acquire 
AMPA-type responses following LTP induction. Our findings challenge the view 
that LTP in CA1 involves a presynaptic modification, and suggest instead a 
simple postsynaptic mechanism for both induction and expression of LTP.},

quanta released and in quantal amplitude, consistent with combined pre- and 
postsynaptic modifications. On average, about 60\% of LTP can be accounted for 
by presynaptic enhancement. The increase in either quantal amplitude or quantal 
content varies significantly among different experiments, but is inversely 
correlated with its initial value. These results may help to reconcile the 
different views concerning the site of LTP expression.}, Institution

prostate cancer. We investigated the potential prognostic roles of IL-6, IL-8

prostate cancer patients undergoing curative radical prostatectomy were included 
in this study. The IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 polymorphisms were determined by the 
TaqMan real-time PCR method. Their prognostic significance on prostate-specific 
antigen (PSA) recurrence was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox 
regression model. Results: The IL-6 polymorphism (rs2066992) T/G and G/G 
genotype cases were associated with a higher percentage of preoperative PSA 
levels of >/=10 ng/ml; higher risk of positive surgical margin, and higher risk 
of extraprostatic extension compared to the T/T genotype. The IL-10 polymorphism 
(rs1800871) A/A genotype was associated with a higher risk of PSA recurrence 
compared with the A/G + G/G genotypes and significantly poorer PSA-free survival 
(log-rank test, p = 0.019). After considering other covariates in a Cox 
proportional hazard model, the IL-10A/A genotype and high Gleason score (8-10) 
were still independent predictors of poor PSA-free survival. Conclusion: Our 
results suggest that the IL-10 polymorphism may be a prognostic factor for PSA 
recurrence after radical prostatectomy.}, bdsk-url-1  =

AMPA-induced AMPA receptor internalization are differentially dependent on 
protein phosphatases and sequence determinants within the cytoplasmic tails of 
GluR1 and GluR2 subunits. AMPA receptors internalized in response to AMPA 
stimulation enter a recycling endosome system, whereas those internalized in

adaptation begins postsynaptically but is ultimately communicated to presynaptic

Critical postsynaptic modifications occur over hours, but enable retrograde 
communication within minutes once AMPA receptor (AMPAR) blockade is removed, 
causing elevation of both spontaneous and evoked vesicle fusion. The retrograde 
signaling does not require spiking activity and can be interrupted by NBQX, 
philanthotoxin, postsynaptic BAPTA, or external sequestration of BDNF, 
consistent with the acute release of retrograde messenger, triggered by 
postsynaptic Ca(2+) elevation via Ca(2+)-permeable AMPARs.}, Doi

  abstract    = {1. Postsynaptic currents originating from activation of the two 
major excitatory inputs to Purkinje cells were studied in thin slices of rat 
cerebellum, using the tight-seal whole-cell recording technique. Two types of 
excitatory postsynaptic currents were analysed: those evoked by stimulation of 
the granule cell-parallel fibre system (PF-EPSC) and those elicited by 
stimulation of the climbing fibres (CF-EPSC). 2. Both types of postsynaptic 
currents had a linear current-voltage relation, reversing at membrane potentials 
close to 0 mV. Their time course of activation was independent of the membrane 
potential. 3. For both types of postsynaptic currents, the time course of decay 
was well described by a single exponential function, with a time constant which 
increased as the membrane potential was made more positive. 4. Postsynaptic 
currents arising from stimulation of the climbing fibre generally had a slightly 
faster time course of onset and decay than those associated with stimulation of 
the granule cell-parallel fibre system. The average values of the 10-90\% rise 
time were 1.8 +/- 0.4 ms (means +/- S.D., n = 7) for PF-EPSCs and 0.8 +/- 0.3 ms 
(n = 9) for CF-EPSCs. Time constants of decay, at a holding potential of -60 mV, 
had values of 8.3 +/- 1.6 ms (n = 7) and 6.4 +/- 1.1 ms (n = 9) for PF-EPSCs and 
CF-EPSCs respectively. 5. CF-EPSCs and PF-EPSCs had the characteristics 
described above in slices derived from animals aged 9-22 days old and 9-15 days 
old, respectively. The PF-EPSCs in animals older than 15 days had very slow time 
courses and positive apparent reversal potentials, suggesting that they 
originated from distal locations, not under accurate voltage control. 6. In 
order to assess the quality of the voltage clamp, responses to hyperpolarizing 
pulses from -70 mV were analysed. The capacitive currents could be fitted by the 
sum of two exponentials, and were interpreted with an equivalent electrical 
circuit comprising two main compartments (soma and proximal dendrites on one 
hand, distal dendrites on the other). Analysis of synaptic currents in terms of 
this model suggested that the recorded time course of decay was approximately 
correct. 7. CF-EPSCs as well as PF-EPSCs were insensitive to the NMDA receptor 
antagonist 3-3(2-carboxypiperazine-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonate (CPP), but were 
blocked in a dose-dependent reversible manner by the non-NMDA antagonist

believed that learning is due, at least in part, to long-lasting modifications 
of the strengths of synapses in the brain. Theoretical studies have shown that a 
family of synaptic plasticity rules, in which synaptic changes are driven by 
covariance, is particularly useful for many forms of learning, including 
associative memory, gradient estimation, and operant conditioning. 
Covariance-based plasticity is inherently sensitive. Even a slight mistuning of 
the parameters of a covariance-based plasticity rule is likely to result in 
substantial changes in synaptic efficacies. Therefore, the biological relevance 
of covariance-based plasticity models is questionable. Here, we study the 
effects of mistuning parameters of the plasticity rule in a decision making 
model in which synaptic plasticity is driven by the covariance of reward and 
neural activity. An exact covariance plasticity rule yields Herrnstein's 
matching law. We show that although the effect of slight mistuning of the 
plasticity rule on the synaptic efficacies is large, the behavioral effect is 
small. Thus, matching behavior is robust to mistuning of the parameters of the 
covariance-based plasticity rule. Furthermore, the mistuned covariance rule 
results in undermatching, which is consistent with experimentally observed 
behavior. These results substantiate the hypothesis that approximate 
covariance-based synaptic plasticity underlies operant conditioning. However, we 
show that the mistuning of the mean subtraction makes behavior sensitive to the 
mistuning of the properties of the decision making network. Thus, there is a 
tradeoff between the robustness of matching behavior to changes in the 
plasticity rule and its robustness to changes in the properties of the decision 
making network.}, bdsk-url-1  =

this question, we combined chronic imaging of hundreds of spines in the auditory 
cortex of mice in vivo over weeks with modeling techniques to quantitatively 
study the dynamics of spines, the morphological correlates of excitatory 
synapses in the neocortex. We found that the stationary distribution of spine 
sizes of individual neurons can be exceptionally well described by a log-normal 
function. We furthermore show that spines exhibit substantial volatility in 
their sizes at timescales that range from days to months. Interestingly, the 
magnitude of changes in spine sizes is proportional to the size of the spine. 
Such multiplicative dynamics are in contrast with conventional models of 
synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory, which typically assume additive 
dynamics. Moreover, we show that the ongoing dynamics of spine sizes can be 
captured by a simple phenomenological model that operates at two timescales of 
days and months. This model converges to a log-normal distribution, bridging the

deliver different spatiotemporal input patterns to single branches while 
simultaneously recording the uncaging-evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials 
and local Ca2+ signals. Asynchronous input patterns sum linearly in spite of the 
spatial clustering and produce Ca2+ signals that are mediated by NMDA receptors 
(NMDARs). Appropriately timed and sized input patterns ( approximately 20 inputs 
within approximately 6 ms) produce a supralinear summation due to the initiation 
of a dendritic spike. The Ca2+ signals associated with synchronous input were 
larger and mediated by influx through both NMDARs and voltage-gated Ca2+ 
channels (VGCCs). The oblique spike is a fast Na+ spike whose duration is shaped 
by the coincident activation of NMDAR, VGCCs, and transient K+ currents. Our 
results suggest that individual branches can function as single integrative 
compartments.}, Bdsk-url-1               =

caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is one of the most 
destructive diseases of wheat worldwide. To establish compatibility with the 
host, Pst forms special infection structures to invade the plant with minimal 
damage to host cells. Although compatible interaction between wheat and Pst has 
been studied using various approaches, research on molecular mechanisms of the 
interaction is limited. The aim of this study was to develop an EST database of 
wheat infected by Pst in order to determine transcription profiles of genes 
involved in compatible wheat-Pst interaction. RESULTS: Total RNA, extracted from 
susceptible infected wheat leaves harvested at 3, 5 and 8 days post inoculation 
(dpi), was used to create a cDNA library, from which 5,793 ESTs with high 
quality were obtained and clustered into 583 contigs and 2,160 singletons to 
give a set of 2,743 unisequences (GenBank accessions: GR302385 to GR305127). The 
BLASTx program was used to search for homologous genes of the unisequences in 
the GenBank non-redundant protein database. Of the 2,743 unisequences, 52.8\% 
(the largest category) were highly homologous to plant genes; 16.3\% to fungal 
genes and 30\% of no-hit. The functional classification of all ESTs was 
established based on the database entry giving the best E-value using the 
Bevan's classification categories. About 50\% of the ESTs were significantly 
homologous to genes encoding proteins with known functions; 20\% were similar to 
genes encoding proteins with unknown functions and 30\% did not have significant 
homology to any sequence in the database. The quantitative real-time PCR 
(qRT-PCR) analysis determined the transcription profiles and their involvement 
in the wheat-Pst interaction for seven of the gene. CONCLUSION: The cDNA library 
is useful for identifying the functional genes involved in the wheat-Pst 
compatible interaction, and established a new database for studying Pst 
pathogenesis genes and wheat defense genes. The transcription patterns of seven 
genes were confirmed by the qRT-PCR assay to be differentially expressed in 
wheat-Pst compatible and incompatible interaction.}, bdsk-url-1 =

heterogeneous neural circuit may serve as universal analog fading memory. 
Readout neurons can learn to extract in real time from the current state of such 
recurrent neural circuit information about current and past inputs that may be 
needed for diverse tasks. Stable internal states are not required for giving a 
stable output, since transient internal states can be transformed by readout 
neurons into stable target outputs due to the high dimensionality of the 
dynamical system. Our approach is based on a rigorous computational model, the 
liquid state machine, that, unlike Turing machines, does not require sequential 
transitions between well-defined discrete internal states. It is supported, as 
the Turing machine is, by rigorous mathematical results that predict universal 
computational power under idealized conditions, but for the biologically more 
realistic scenario of real-time processing of time-varying inputs. Our approach 
provides new perspectives for the interpretation of neural coding, the design of 
experiments and data analysis in neurophysiology, and the solution of problems 
in robotics and neurotechnology.}, bdsk-url-1  =

  Abstract                 = {In most neural network models, synapses are 
treated as static weights that change only with the slow time scales of 
learning. It is well known, however, that synapses are highly dynamic and show 
use-dependent plasticity over a wide range of time scales. Moreover, synaptic 
transmission is an inherently stochastic process: a spike arriving at a 
presynaptic terminal triggers the release of a vesicle of neurotransmitter from 
a release site with a probability that can be much less than one. We consider a 
simple model for dynamic stochastic synapses that can easily be integrated into 
common models for networks of integrate-and-fire neurons (spiking neurons). The 
parameters of this model have direct interpretations in terms of synaptic 
physiology. We investigate the consequences of the model for computing with 
individual spikes and demonstrate through rigorous theoretical results that the 
computational power of the network is increased through the use of dynamic 
synapses.}, Institution              = {Institute for Theoretical Computer

illusions in humans, and compared them with corresponding neuronal responses in 
the primary visual cortex of awake and anesthetized monkeys. Stimulus parameters 
that in humans produce forward masking (in which the mask precedes the target) 
suppress the transient on-response to the target in monkey visual cortex. Those 
that produce backward masking (in which the mask comes after the target) inhibit 
the transient after-discharge, the excitatory response that occurs just after 
the disappearance of the target. These results suggest that, for targets that

  Abstract                 = {Brain rhythms arise through the synchronization of 
neurons and their entrainment in a regular firing pattern. In this process, 
networks of reciprocally connected inhibitory neurons are often involved, but 
what mechanism determines the oscillation frequency is not completely 
understood. Analytical studies predict that the emerging frequency band is 
primarily constrained by the decay rate of the unitary IPSC. We observed a new 
phenomenon of resonant synchronization in computer-simulated networks of 
inhibitory neurons in which the synaptic current has a delayed onset, reflecting 
finite spike propagation and synaptic transmission times. At the resonant level 
of network excitation, all neurons fire synchronously and rhythmically with a 
period approximately four times the mean delay of the onset of the inhibitory 
synaptic current. The amplitude and decay time constant of the synaptic current 
have relatively minor effects on the emerging frequency band. By varying the 
axonal delay of the inhibitory connections, networks with a realistic synaptic 
kinetics can be tuned to frequencies from 40 to >200 Hz. This resonance 
phenomenon arises in heterogeneous networks with, on average, as few as five 
connections per neuron. We conclude that the delay of the synaptic current is 
the primary parameter controlling the oscillation frequency of inhibitory 
networks and propose that delay-induced synchronization is a mechanism for fast 
brain rhythms that depend on intact inhibitory synaptic transmission.},

{The threshold for hippocampal-dependent synaptic plasticity and memory storage 
is thought to be determined by the balance between protein phosphorylation and 
dephosphorylation mediated by the kinase PKA and the phosphatase calcineurin. To 
establish whether endogenous calcineurin acts as an inhibitory constraint in 
this balance, we examined the effect of genetically inhibiting calcineurin on 
plasticity and memory. Using the doxycycline-dependent rtTA system to express a 
calcineurin inhibitor reversibly in the mouse brain, we find that the transient 
reduction of calcineurin activity facilitates LTP in vitro and in vivo. This 
facilitation is PKA dependent and persists over several days in vivo. It is 
accompanied by enhanced learning and strengthened short- and long-term memory in 
several hippocampal-dependent spatial and nonspatial tasks. The LTP and memory 
improvements are reversed fully by suppression of transgene expression. These 
results demonstrate that endogenous calcineurin constrains LTP and memory.},

be modified by contextual information. In particular, we investigated how local 
orientation signals within an image are pooled together, and whether this 
pooling process is dependent on the global orientation content present in the 
image. We find that observers' orientation judgments depend on surround 
contextual information, with performance being optimal when the center and 
surround stimuli are clearly distinct. In cases where the center and surround 
were not clearly segregated, we report two sets of results. If there was an 
ambiguity regarding the perception of a global structure (i.e. a small mismatch 
between local cues), observers' performance was impaired. If there was no 
mismatch and local and global cues were consistent with the perception of a 
single surface, observers performed as well as in the distinct surfaces case. 
Although some of our results can be largely accounted for by interactions 
between differently oriented filters, other aspects are more difficult to 
reconcile with this explanation. We suggest that low level filtering constrains 
observers' performance, and that influences arising from image segmentation 
modify how local orientation signals are pooled together.}, institution =

achieved in the brain is a central question in neuroscience. Key to today's 
research into information storage in the brain is the concept of synaptic 
plasticity, a notion that has been heavily influenced by Hebb's (1949) 
postulate. Hebb conjectured that repeatedly and persistently co-active cells 
should increase connective strength among populations of interconnected neurons 
as a means of storing a memory trace, also known as an engram. Hebb certainly 
was not the first to make such a conjecture, as we show in this history. 
Nevertheless, literally thousands of studies into the classical 
frequency-dependent paradigm of cellular learning rules were directly inspired 
by the Hebbian postulate. But in more recent years, a novel concept in cellular 
learning has emerged, where temporal order instead of frequency is emphasized. 
This new learning paradigm - known as spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) - 
has rapidly gained tremendous interest, perhaps because of its combination of 
elegant simplicity, biological plausibility, and computational power. But what 
are the roots of today's STDP concept? Here, we discuss several centuries of 
diverse thinking, beginning with philosophers such as Aristotle, Locke, and 
Ribot, traversing, e.g., Lugaro's plasticit? and Rosenblatt's perceptron, and 
culminating with the discovery of STDP. We highlight interactions between 
theoretical and experimental fields, showing how discoveries sometimes occurred 
in parallel, seemingly without much knowledge of the other field, and sometimes 
via concrete back-and-forth communication. We point out where the future 
directions may lie, which includes interneuron STDP, the functional impact of 
STDP, its mechanisms and its neuromodulatory regulation, and the linking of STDP 
to the developmental formation and continuous plasticity of neuronal networks.},

pyramidal neurons were loaded with the Ca2+ indicator dye Calcium Green-1 (CG-1) 
or fluo-3, and the mechanisms which govern action potential (AP)-evoked 
transient changes in dendritic cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) were 
examined. APs were initiated either by synaptic stimulation or by depolarizing 
the soma or dendrite by current injection, and changes in fluorescence of the 
indicator dye were measured in the proximal 170 microns of the apical dendrite. 
2. Simultaneous two-pipette recordings of APs from the soma and apical dendrite, 
and dendritic fluorescence imaging indicated that a single AP propagating from 
the soma into the apical dendrite evokes a rapid transient increase in 
fluorescence indicating a transient increase in [Ca2+]i. At 35-37 degrees C the 
decay time constant of the fluorescence transient following an AP was around 80 
ms. 3. Voltage-activated Ca2+ channels (VACCs) of several subtypes mediated the 
AP-evoked fluorescence transient in the proximal (100-170 microns) apical 
dendrite. The AP-evoked fluorescence transient resulted from Ca2+ entry through 
L-type (nifedipine sensitive; 25\%), N-type (omega-conotoxin GVIA sensitive; 
28\%) and P-type (omega-agatoxin IVA sensitive; 10\%) Ca2+ channels and through 
Ca2+ channels (R-type) not sensitive to L-, N- and P-type Ca2+ channel blockers 
(cadmium ion sensitive; 37\%). 4. The decay time course of the dendritic 
fluorescence transient was prolonged by the blockers of endoplasmic reticulum 
(ER) Ca(2+)-ATPase, cyclopiazonic acid and thapsigargin, suggesting that uptake 
of Ca2+ into the ER in dendrites governs clearance of dendritic Ca2+. 5. The 
decay time course of the fluorescence transient was slightly prolonged by 
benzamil, a blocker of plasma membrane Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange and by calmidazolium, 
a blocker of the calmodulin-dependent plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase, suggesting 
that these pathways are less important for dendrite Ca2+ clearance following a 
single AP. Neither the mitochondrial uncoupler carbonyl cyanide 
p-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP) nor the blocker of Ca2+ uptake into 
mitochondria, Ruthenium Red, had any measurable effect on the decay time course 
of the fluorescence transient. 6. Dendritic fluorescence transients measured 
during trains of dendritic APs began to summate at impulse frequencies of 5 APs 
s-1. At higher frequencies APs caused a concerted and maintained elevation of 
dendritic fluorescence during the train.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

response to NMDA was blocked by pre-loading cells with the K+ channel blocker, 
Cs+. Topical application of OAG had no significant effect on current responses

responses to NMDA. Intracellular application of the kinase inhibitor, H-7, 
completely blocked the effect of OAG on the amplitude and duration of responses 
to NMDA, as well as on the slow EPSP. Finally, topical application of another 
activator of PKC, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), also suppressed 
responses to NMDA. PMA reduced the slow component of synaptic responses in about 
half of the cells tested. 5. We propose that activation of PKC in CA1

The cellular mechanism by which acetylcholine (ACh) potentiates neuronal 
responses to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) was investigated in CA1 neurones of 
hippocampal slices using current- and voltage-clamp techniques. 2. Loading cells 
with 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate (GppNHp) caused a gradual increase in response 
to NMDA. Pulses of ACh accelerated this increase. Guanosine 
5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDP beta S) blocked the potentiating effect of ACh on 
responses to NMDA. 3. Acute LiCl caused a gradual decrease in the potentiating 
effect of ACh, while the potentiation was completely prevented by 3 day chronic 
6 mequiv/kg (I.P.) LiCl treatment and restored by acute treatment with 10 
mM-inositol. 4. Loading cells with a general protein kinase inhibitor, H-7, 
enhanced the potentiating effect of ACh on responses to NMDA and blocked the 
effect of ACh on the after-hyperpolarization (AHP). 5. Ultraviolet irradiation 
of cells loaded with a photolabile inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) caused a 
transient increase in responses to NMDA, while penetrating cells with active 
InsP3-containing pipettes caused a gradual BAPTA-sensitive increase in responses 
to NMDA. 6. Reducing the rate of InsP3 metabolism, with 2,3-diphosphoglyceric 
acid (DPG), caused an increase and prolongation of the potentiating effect of 
ACh, while blocking the InsP3 receptor with heparin prevented the cholinergic 
potentiation. 7. NMDA, by itself, potentiated subsequent responses to NMDA, an 
effect that was blocked when [Ca2+]i was chelated with BAPTA. NMDA and ACh were 
also found to compete in potentiating responses to NMDA. Finally, the 
cholinergic potentiation was blocked when cells were loaded with BAPTA. 8. We 
propose that activation of the InsP3 branch of the phosphoinositide pathway 
potentiated responses to NMDA and that InsP3 exerted this effect by elevating 
[Ca2+]i.},

  Abstract                 = {The nature of information stemming from a single 
neuron and conveyed simultaneously to several hundred target neurons is not 
known. Triple and quadruple neuron recordings revealed that each synaptic 
connection established by neocortical pyramidal neurons is potentially unique. 
Specifically, synaptic connections onto the same morphological class differed in 
the numbers and dendritic locations of synaptic contacts, their absolute 
synaptic strengths, as well as their rates of synaptic depression and recovery 
from depression. The same axon of a pyramidal neuron innervating another 
pyramidal neuron and an interneuron mediated frequency-dependent depression and 
facilitation, respectively, during high frequency discharges of presynaptic 
action potentials, suggesting that the different natures of the target neurons 
underlie qualitative differences in synaptic properties. Facilitating-type 
synaptic connections established by three pyramidal neurons of the same class 
onto a single interneuron, were all qualitatively similar with a combination of 
facilitation and depression mechanisms. The time courses of facilitation and 
depression, however, differed for these convergent connections, suggesting that 
different pre-postsynaptic interactions underlie quantitative differences in 
synaptic properties. Mathematical analysis of the transfer functions of 
frequency-dependent synapses revealed supra-linear, linear, and sub-linear 
signaling regimes in which mixtures of presynaptic rates, integrals of rates, 
and derivatives of rates are transferred to targets depending on the precise 
values of the synaptic parameters and the history of presynaptic action 
potential activity. Heterogeneity of synaptic transfer functions therefore 
allows multiple synaptic representations of the same presynaptic action 
potential train and suggests that these synaptic representations are regulated 
in a complex manner. It is therefore proposed that differential signaling is a 
key mechanism in neocortical information processing, which can be regulated by 
selective synaptic modifications.}, Institution              = {Department of

  Abstract                 = {We have studied the neuronal circuitry and 
structure-function relationships of single neurones in the striate visual cortex 
of the cat using a combination of electrophysiological and anatomical 
techniques. Glass micropipettes filled with horseradish peroxidase were used to 
record extracellularly from single neurones. After studying the receptive field 
properties, the afferent inputs of the neurones were studied by determining 
their latency of response to electrical stimulation at different positions along 
the optic pathway. Some cells were thus classified as receiving a mono- or 
polysynaptic input from afferents of the lateral geniculate nucleus (l.g.n.), 
via X- or Y-like retinal ganglion cells. Two striking correlations were found 
between dendritic morphology and receptive field type. All spiny stellate cells, 
and all star pyramidal cells in layer 4A, had receptive fields with spatially 
separate on and off subfields (S-type receptive fields). All the identified 
afferent input to these, the major cell types in layer 4, was monosynaptic from 
X- or Y-like afferents. Neurones receiving monosynaptic X- or Y-like input were 
not strictly segregated in layer 4 and the lower portion of layer 3. 
Nevertheless the X- and Y-like l.g.n. fibres did not converge on any of the 
single neurones so far studied. Monosynaptic input from the l.g.n. afferents was 
not restricted to cells lying within layers 4 and 6, the main termination zones 
of the l.g.n. afferents, but was also received by cells lying in layers 3 and 5. 
The projection pattern of cells receiving monosynaptic input differed widely, 
depending on the laminar location of the cell soma. This suggests the presence 
of a number of divergent paths within the striate cortex. Cells receiving 
indirect input from the l.g.n. afferents were located mainly within layers 2, 3 
and 5. Most pyramidal cells in layer 3 had axons projecting out of the striate 
cortex, while many axons of the layer 5 pyramids did not. The layer 5 cells 
showed the most morphological variation of any layer, were the most difficult to 
activate by electrical stimulation, and contained some cells which responded 
with the longest latencies of any cells in the striate cortex. This suggests 
that they were several synapses distant from the l.g.n. input. The majority of 
cells in layers 2, 3, 4 and 6 had the same basic S-type receptive field 
structure. Only layer 5 contained a majority of cells with spatially overlapping 
on and off subfields (C- and B-type receptive fields).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400

unknown. We investigated the structural basis of long-term potentiation using 
two-photon photolysis of caged glutamate at single spines of hippocampal CA1 
pyramidal neurons. Here we show that repetitive quantum-like photorelease 
(uncaging) of glutamate induces a rapid and selective enlargement of stimulated 
spines that is transient in large mushroom spines but persistent in small 
spines. Spine enlargement is associated with an increase in 
AMPA-receptor-mediated currents at the stimulated synapse and is dependent on 
NMDA receptors, calmodulin and actin polymerization. Long-lasting spine 
enlargement also requires Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. Our 
results thus indicate that spines individually follow Hebb's postulate for 
learning. They further suggest that small spines are preferential sites for 
long-term potentiation induction, whereas large spines might represent physical 
traces of long-term memory.}, bdsk-url-1  =

that signals relayed by the magnocellular and parvocellular subdivisions of the 
primate lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) maintain their segregation in cortical 
processing. We have examined two response properties of units in the striate 
cortex of macaque monkeys, latency and transience, with the goal of assessing 
whether they might be used to infer specific geniculate contributions. 
Recordings were made from 298 isolated units and 1,129 multiunit sites in the 
striate cortex in four monkeys. Excitotoxin lesions that selectively affected 
one or the other LGN subdivision were made in three animals to demonstrate 
directly the magnocellular and parvocellular contributions. An additional 435 
single units and 551 multiunit sites were recorded after the ablations. 2. Most 
units in striate cortex had visual response latencies in the range of 30-50 ms 
under the stimulus conditions used. The earliest neuronal responses in striate 
cortex differed appreciably between individuals. The shortest latency recorded 
in the four animals ranged from 20 to 31 ms. Comparable values were obtained 
from both single unit and multiunit sites. After lesions were made in the 
magnocellular subdivision of the LGN in two animals, the shortest response 
latencies were 7 and 10 ms later than before the ablations. A larger lesion in 
the parvocellular subdivision of another animal produced no such shift. Thus it 
appears that the first 7-10 ms of cortical activation can be attributed to 
activation relayed by the magnocellular layers of the LGN. 3. The units with the 
shortest latencies were all found in layers 4C or 6 and their responses were 
among the most transient in striate cortex. Furthermore, their responses all 
showed a pronounced periodicity at a frequency of 50-100 Hz. This periodicity 
was stimulus locked, and the responses of all short-latency units oscillated in 
phase. 4. An index of response transience was computed for the units recorded in 
striate cortex. The distribution of this index was unimodal and gave no 
suggestion of distinct contributions from the geniculate subdivisions. 
Magnocellular and the parvocellular lesions affected the overall transience of 
responses in striate cortex. The changes, however, were very small; extremely 
transient responses and extremely sustained responses survived both types of 
lesions. 5. A characteristic profile was observed in the response latencies in 
superficial layers. Latencies appeared to increase monotonically from layer 4 
toward the surface of cortex, with the most superficial neurons not becoming 
active until 15 ms after responses were observed in layer 4C.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED

  Abstract                 = {We propose a mathematical model based on the 
occupation theory and on the hypothesis that, for a given stimulus, there exist 
two kinds of receptors. The receptors of the first kind react by a two-step 
process, first forming an intermediate inactive compound which is then changed 
into an active depolarizing form (this scheme was already used by Del Castillo & 
Katz, 1957). In the same way, the receptors of the second kind react by a 
two-step process, first forming an intermediate inactive compound which is then 
changed into an active hyperpolarizing form. The response is assumed to be 
proportional to the difference between the fraction of the active depolarizing 
compound and that of the active hyperpolarizing compound. The present paper 
deals only with the time course of the intensity of the response: in the first 
part, when a continuous flow of stimulus is applied and in the second part, when 
this continuous flow is removed. It does not deal with the quality and the 
discrimination of odours. The proposed mathematical model accounts for the 
depolarizing responses (which are the most frequent ones), the hyperpolarizing 
responses, the mixed responses reported by Patte et al. (1989), the 
off-responses reported by Takagi & Shibuya (1959) and for their variability, and 
the latent period in the olfactory response (Ottoson, 1974).}, Bdsk-url-1

the amino-acid glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter. During 
evolution, a family of glutamate-receptor ion channels seems to have been 
assembled from a kit consisting of discrete ligand-binding, ion-channel,

unique architecture have greatly aided structural analysis of the ligand-binding 
core, but the results also pose a formidable challenge, namely that of resolving 
the allosteric mechanisms by which individual domains communicate and function

to GluR6 is prevented by steric occlusion, which also interferes with the 
high-affinity binding of 2S,4R-4-methylglutamate to AMPA receptors. Strikingly, 
the extent of domain closure produced by the GluR6 partial agonist kainate is 
only 3 degrees less than for glutamate and 11 degrees greater than for the GluR2 
kainate complex. This, together with extensive interdomain contacts between 
domains 1 and 2 of GluR5 and GluR6, absent from AMPA receptors, likely 
contributes to the high stability of GluR5 and GluR6 kainate complexes.},

as a result of structural studies performed in the past three years we now have 
a mechanistic explanation for the activation of channel gating by agonists and 
partial agonists; the process of desensitization, and its block by allosteric 
modulators, is also mostly explained; and the basis of receptor subtype 
selectivity is emerging with clarity as more and more structures are solved. In 
the space of months we have gone from cartoons of postulated mechanisms to hard

system, which codes for the animal's head direction in the horizontal plane, is 
thought to be critically involved in spatial navigation. Electrophysiological 
recording studies have shown that HD cells can anticipate the animal's HD by up 
to 75-80 ms. The origin of this anticipation is poorly understood. In this 
modeling study, we provide a novel explanation for HD anticipation that relies 
on the firing properties of neurons afferent to the HD system. By incorporating 
spike rate adaptation and postinhibitory rebound as observed in medial 
vestibular nucleus neurons, our model produces realistic anticipation on a large 
corpus of rat movement data. In addition, HD anticipation varies between 
recording sessions of the same cell, between active and passive movement, and 
between different studies. Such differences do not appear to be correlated with 
behavioral variables and cannot be accounted for using earlier models. In the 
present model, anticipation depends on the power spectrum of the head movements. 
By direct comparison with recording data, we show that the model explains 
60-80\% of the observed anticipation variability. We conclude that HD afferent 
dynamics and the statistics of rat head movements are important in generating HD 
anticipation. This result contributes to understanding the functional circuitry 
of the HD system and has methodological implications for studies of HD 
anticipation.}, bdsk-url-1  = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/jn.00233.2007}, doi

ongoing learning of the structure of neural inputs is to occur. In this paper, a 
wide class of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) models is identified that

of subgroups of synapses that are correlated within the subgroup through the 
occurrence of simultaneous input spikes. The process of synaptic structure 
formation is studied, illustrating one particular class of these models. When 
the learning rate is small, multiple alternative synaptic structures are 
possible given the same inputs, with the outcome depending on the initial weight 
configuration. For large learning rates, the synaptic structure does not 
stabilize, resulting in neurons without consistent response properties. For 
learning rates in between, a unique and stable synaptic structure typically 
forms. When this synaptic structure exhibits a bimodal distribution, the neuron 
will respond selectively to one or more of the subgroups. The robustness with 
which this selectivity develops during learning is largely determined by the 
ratio of the subgroup correlation strength to the number of subgroups. The 
fraction of potentiated subgroups is primarily determined by the balance between

the control of gain without the use of noise. We show that a depolarizing 
afterpotential (DAP), arising from active dendritic spike backpropagation, leads 
to a multiplicative increase in gain. Reduction of DAP amplitude by dendritic 
inhibition dilutes the multiplicative effect, allowing for divisive scaling of 
the firing rate. In contrast, somatic inhibition acts in a subtractive manner, 
allowing spatially distinct inhibitory inputs to perform distinct computations.

  Abstract                 = {During the last decade, advances in experimental 
techniques and quantitative modelling have resulted in the development of the 
calyx of Held as one of the best preparations in which to study synaptic 
transmission. Here we review some of these advances, including simultaneous 
recording of pre- and postsynaptic currents, measuring the Ca2+ sensitivity of 
transmitter release, reconstructing the 3-D anatomy at the electron microscope 
(EM) level, and modelling the buffered diffusion of Ca2+ in the nerve terminal. 
An important outcome of these studies is an improved understanding of the Ca2+ 
signal that controls phasic transmitter release. This article illustrates the 
spatial and temporal aspects of the three main steps in the presynaptic 
signalling cascade: Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated calcium channels, buffered 
Ca2+ diffusion from the channels to releasable vesicles, and activation of the 
Ca2+ sensor for release. Particular emphasis is placed on how presynaptic Ca2+ 
buffers affect the Ca2+ signal and thus the amplitude and time course of the 
release probability. Since many aspects of the signalling cascade were first 
conceived with reference to the squid giant presynaptic terminal, we include 
comparisons with the squid model and revisit some of its implications. Whilst 
the characteristics of buffered Ca2+ diffusion presented here are based on the 
calyx of Held, we demonstrate the circumstances under which they may be valid 
for other nerve terminals at mammalian CNS synapses.}, Bdsk-url-1

  Abstract                 = {Phasic transmitter release at synapses in the 
mammalian CNS is regulated by local [Ca2+] transients, which control the fusion 
of readily releasable vesicles docked at active zones (AZs) in the presynaptic 
membrane. The time course and amplitude of these [Ca2+] transients critically 
determine the time course and amplitude of the release and thus the frequency 
and amplitude tuning of the synaptic connection. As yet, the spatiotemporal 
nature of the [Ca2+] transients and the number and location of 
release-controlling Ca2+ channels relative to the vesicles, the "topography" of 
the release sites, have remained elusive. We used a time-dependent model to 
simulate Ca2+ influx, three-dimensional buffered Ca2+ diffusion, and the binding 
of Ca2+ to the release sensor. The parameters of the model were constrained by 
recent anatomical and biophysical data of the calyx of Held. Comparing the 
predictions of the model with previously measured release probabilities under a 
variety of experimental conditions, we inferred which release site topography is 
likely to operate at the calyx: At each AZ one or a few clusters of Ca2+ 
channels control the release of the vesicles. The distance of a vesicle to the 
cluster(s) varies across the multiple release sites of a single calyx (ranging 
from 30 to 300 nm; average approximately 100 nm). Assuming this topography, 
vesicles in different locations are exposed to different [Ca2+] transients, with 
peak amplitudes ranging from 0.5 to 40 microm (half-width approximately 400 
microsec) during an action potential. Consequently the vesicles have different 
release probabilities ranging from <0.01 to 1. We demonstrate how this spatially 
heterogeneous release probability creates functional advantages for synaptic 
transmission.}, Institution              = {Max Planck Institute for Medical

  Abstract                 = {The primary function of the presynaptic nerve 
terminal is to release transmitter quanta and thus activate the postsynaptic 
target cell. In almost every step leading to the release of transmitter quanta, 
there is a substantial involvement of ion channels. In this review, the 
multitude of ion channels in the presynaptic terminal are surveyed. There are at 
least 12 different major categories of ion channels representing several tens of 
different ion channel types; the number of different ion channel molecules at 
presynaptic nerve terminals is many hundreds. We describe the different ion 
channel molecules at the surface membrane and inside the nerve terminal in the 
context of their possible role in the process of transmitter release. 
Frequently, a number of different ion channel molecules, with the same basic 
function, are present at the same nerve terminal. This is especially evident in 
the cases of calcium channels and potassium channels. This abundance of ion 
channels allows for a physiological and pharmacological fine tuning of the 
process of transmitter release and thus of synaptic transmission.}, Institution

out in an anatomically characterized neocortical pyramidal cell to study the 
integrative behavior of a complex dendritic tree containing active membrane 
mechanisms. Building on a previously presented hypothesis, this work provides 
further support for a novel principle of dendritic information processing that 
could underlie a capacity for nonlinear pattern discrimination and/or sensory 
processing within the dendritic trees of individual nerve cells. 2. It was 
previously demonstrated that when excitatory synaptic input to a pyramidal cell 
is dominated by voltage-dependent N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type channels, the 
cell responds more strongly when synaptic drive is concentrated within several 
dendritic regions than when it is delivered diffusely across the dendritic 
arbor. This effect, called dendritic "cluster sensitivity," persisted under 
wide-ranging parameter variations and directly implicated the spatial ordering 
of afferent synaptic connections onto the dendritic tree as an important 
determinant of neuronal response selectivity. 3. In this work, the sensitivity 
of neocortical dendrites to spatially clustered synaptic drive has been further 
studied with fast sodium and slow calcium spiking mechanisms present in the 
dendritic membrane. Several spatial distributions of the dendritic spiking 
mechanisms were tested with and without NMDA synapses. Results of numerous 
simulations reveal that dendritic cluster sensitivity is a highly robust 
phenomenon in dendrites containing a sufficiency of excitatory membrane 
mechanisms and is only weakly dependent on their detailed spatial distribution, 
peak conductances, or kinetics. Factors that either work against or make 
irrelevant the dendritic cluster sensitivity effect include 1) very 
high-resistance spine necks, 2) very large synaptic conductances, 3) very high 
baseline levels of synaptic activity, and 4) large fluctuations in level of 
synaptic activity on short time scales. 4. The functional significance of 
dendritic cluster sensitivity has been previously discussed in the context of 
associative learning and memory. Here it is demonstrated that the dendritic tree 
of a cluster-sensitive neuron implements an approximative spatial correlation, 
or sum of products operation, such as that which could underlie nonlinear 
disparity tuning in binocular visual neurons.}, institution = {Computation and

threshold for tLTP induction is increased. Calcium signaling in dendrites and 
spines is compromised. First, dendrites and spines more often fail to show

spines. tLTP could be restored by improving reliability and amplitude of calcium 
signaling by increasing neuronal activity. In FMR1-KO mice that were raised in

abstract    = {Development of cognitive function requires the formation and 
refinement of synaptic networks of neurons in the brain. Morphological 
abnormalities of synaptic spines occur throughout the brain in a wide variety of 
syndromic and non-syndromic disorders of mental retardation (MR). In both 
neurons from human post-mortem tissue and mouse models of retardation, the 
changes observed in synaptic spine and dendritic morphology can be subtle, in 
the range of 10-20\% alterations for spine protrusion length and density. 
Functionally, synapses in hippocampus and cortex show deficits in long-term 
potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) in an array of 
neurodevelopmental disorders including Down's, Angelman, Fragile X and Rett 
syndrome. Recent studies have shown that in principle the machinery for synaptic 
plasticity is in place in these synapses, but that significant alterations in 
spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) induction rules exist in cortical 
synaptic pathways of Fragile X MR syndrome. In this model, the threshold for 
inducing timing-dependent long-term potentiation (tLTP) is increased in these 
synapses. Increased postsynaptic activity can overcome this threshold and induce 
normal levels of tLTP. In this review, we bring together recent studies 
investigating STDP in neurodevelopmental learning disorders using Fragile X 
syndrome as a model and we argue that alterations in dendritic excitability 
underlie deficits seen in STDP. Known and candidate dendritic mechanisms that 
may underlie the plasticity deficits are discussed. Studying STDP in monogenic 
MR syndromes with clear deficits in information processing at the cognitive 
level also provides the field with an opportunity to make direct links between

in the primary visual cortex of higher mammals respond selectively to light/dark 
borders of a particular orientation. The receptive fields of simple cells, a 
type of orientation-selective cell, consist of adjacent, oriented regions 
alternately receiving ON-center and OFF-center excitatory input. I show that 
this segregation of inputs within receptive fields can occur through an 
activity-dependent competition between ON-center and OFF-center inputs, just as 
segregation of inputs between different postsynaptic cells into ocular dominance 
columns appears to occur through activity-dependent competition between left-eye 
and right-eye inputs. These different outcomes are proposed to result, not from 
different mechanisms, but from different spatial structures of the correlations 
in neural activity among the competing inputs in each case. Simple cells result 
if ON-center inputs are best correlated with other ON-center inputs, and OFF 
with OFF, at small retinotopic separations, but ON-center inputs are best 
correlated with OFF-center inputs at larger separations. This hypothesis leads 
robustly to development of simple cell receptive fields selective for 
orientation and spatial frequency, and to the continuous and periodic 
arrangement of preferred orientation across the cortex. Input correlations 
determine the mean preferred spatial frequency and degree of orientation 
selectivity. Estimates of these correlations based on measurements in adult cat 
retina (Mastronarde, 1983a,b) produce quantitative predictions for the mean 
preferred spatial frequencies of cat simple cells across eccentricities that 
agree with experiments (Movshon et al., 1978b). Intracortical interactions are 
the primary determinant of cortical organization. Simple cell spatial phases can 
play a key role in this organization, so arrangements of spatial phases and 
preferred orientations may need to be studied together to understand either 
alone. Possible origins for other cortical features including spatial frequency 
clusters, afferent ON/OFF segregation, blobs, pinwheels, and opponent inhibition 
within simple cell receptive fields are suggested. A number of strong 
experimental tests of the hypothesis are proposed.}, institution = {Division of

  Abstract                 = {Activation of different types of G-protein-linked 
and ionotropic presynaptic receptors has been shown to regulate neurotransmitter 
release throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems. In the case of 
G-protein-linked receptors, three major mechanisms have been suggested: (a) 
inhibition of Ca channels in the nerve terminal; (b) the activation of 
presynaptic K channels, resulting in a reduction in the effectiveness of the 
action potential; and (c) direct modulation of one or more components of the 
neurotransmitter vesicle release apparatus. In the case of ionotropic 
presynaptic receptors, inhibition of release may be achieved through 
depolarization of the terminal and inactivation of Na and Ca channels. 
Activation of presynaptic ionotropic receptors that are appreciably Ca permeable 
can also enhance the release of transmitters as a result of their ability to 
raise [Ca]i in the terminal directly. Many transmitters employ several of these 
mechanisms, thus allowing considerable flexibility in the presynaptic regulation 
of transmitter release.}, Bdsk-url-1               =

used as a buffer that is loaded, refreshed, and read out by spiking activity. 
Because of the long time constants of calcium kinetics, the refresh rate can be 
low, resulting in a mechanism that is metabolically efficient and robust. The 
duration and stability of working memory can be regulated by modulating the

this correlated responsivity for visual coding and perception, often by 
comparing the information conveyed by pairs of simultaneously recorded neurons 
with the sum of information provided by the respective individual cells. 
Pairwise responses typically provide slightly more information so that encoding 
is weakly synergistic. The simple comparison between pairwise and summed 
individual responses conflates several forms of correlation, however, making it 
impossible to judge the relative importance of synchronous spiking, basic tuning 
properties, and stimulus-independent and stimulus-dependent correlation. We have 
applied an information theoretic approach to this question, using the responses 
of pairs of neurons to drifting sinusoidal gratings of different directions and 
contrasts that have been recorded in the primary visual cortex of anesthetized 
macaque monkeys. Our approach allows us to break down the information provided 
by pairs of neurons into a number of components. This analysis reveals that, 
although synchrony is prevalent and informative, the additional information it 
provides frequently is offset by the redundancy arising from the similar tuning 
properties of the two cells. Thus coding is approximately independent with weak 
synergy or redundancy arising, depending on the similarity in tuning and the 
temporal precision of the analysis. We suggest that this would allow cortical 
circuits to enjoy the stability provided by having similarly tuned neurons 
without suffering the penalty of redundancy, because the associated information 
transmission deficit is compensated for by stimulus-dependent synchrony.},

spike times is crucial for a quantitative understanding of brain function, but 
it is difficult because of an upward bias due to limited experimental sampling. 
We present new progress, based on two basic insights, on reducing the bias 
problem. First, we show that by means of a careful application of data-shuffling 
techniques, it is possible to cancel almost entirely the bias of the noise 
entropy, the most biased part of information. This procedure provides a new 
information estimator that is much less biased than the standard direct one and 
has similar variance. Second, we use a nonparametric test to determine whether 
all the information encoded by the spike train can be decoded assuming a 
low-dimensional response model. If this is the case, the complexity of response 
space can be fully captured by a small number of easily sampled parameters. 
Combining these two different procedures, we obtain a new class of precise 
estimators of information quantities, which can provide data-robust upper and 
lower bounds to the mutual information. These bounds are tight even when the 
number of trials per stimulus available is one order of magnitude smaller than 
the number of possible responses. The effectiveness and the usefulness of the 
methods are tested through applications to simulated data and recordings from 
somatosensory cortex. This application shows that even in the presence of strong 
correlations, our methods constrain precisely the amount of information encoded

plasticity (STDP). Confronted with the plethora of theoretical models for STDP 
available, we reexamine the experimental data. On this basis, we propose a novel 
STDP update rule, with a multiplicative dependence on the synaptic weight for 
depression, and a power law dependence for potentiation. We show that this rule, 
when implemented in large, balanced networks of realistic connectivity and 
sparseness, is compatible with the asynchronous irregular activity regime. The 
resultant equilibrium weight distribution is unimodal with fluctuating 
individual weight trajectories and does not exhibit development of structure. We 
investigate the robustness of our results with respect to the relative strength 
of depression. We introduce synchronous stimulation to a group of neurons and 
demonstrate that the decoupling of this group from the rest of the network is so 
severe that it cannot effectively control the spiking of other neurons, even

to provide a framework for classifying and evaluating different models of 
plasticity. We focus on phenomenological synaptic models that are compatible 
with integrate-and-fire type neuron models where each neuron is described by a 
small number of variables. This implies that synaptic update rules for 
short-term or long-term plasticity can only depend on spike timing and, 
potentially, on membrane potential, as well as on the value of the synaptic 
weight, or on low-pass filtered (temporally averaged) versions of the above 
variables. We examine the ability of the models to account for experimental data 
and to fulfill expectations derived from theoretical considerations. We further 
discuss their relations to teacher-based rules (supervised learning) and 
reward-based rules (reinforcement learning). All models discussed in this paper

interactions impose severe constraints on the explorable system size that 
previously have been hard to overcome. Here we present a collection of new 
techniques combined to a coherent simulation tool removing the fundamental 
obstacle in the computational study of biological neural networks: the enormous 
number of synaptic contacts per neuron. Distributing an individual simulation 
over multiple computers enables the investigation of networks orders of 
magnitude larger than previously possible. The software scales excellently on a 
wide range of tested hardware, so it can be used in an interactive and iterative 
fashion for the development of ideas, and results can be produced quickly even 
for very large networks. In contrast to earlier approaches, a wide class of 
neuron models and synaptic dynamics can be represented.}, Bdsk-url-1

to longer timing intervals. Stimuli were flashed in receptive fields in the near 
periphery while monkeys maintained steady fixation. Short interstimulus 
intervals (ISIs) resulted in an overall habituation style response reduction. 
The transient component of responses to preferred stimuli was suppressed, often 
completely, when the ISI was reduced below 100 ms into the range of saccadic 
durations. The sustained response component weakened but remained intact. At 
short ISIs the trailing activity from the preceding stimulus blended with onset 
activity from the next stimulus, making it difficult to detect individual 
stimulus onset events within the spike train. Habituation or conditioning 
effects were correlated with the stimulus tuning sensitivity of the neuron but 
only loosely associated with the actual level of V4 activation elicited by 
preceding stimuli. The results suggest that sharply tuned neurons, because of 
their probabilistic inactivity, are particularly sensitive to temporal change, 
whereas the sustained components of broadly tuned neurons could provide a 
continuity of information flow across visual transients, such as saccades, that 
do not alter significantly the view by the neuron of the scene.}, bdsk-url-1  =

Previous theoretical work has concluded that excitation or inhibition alone will 
not cause a multiplicative gain change in the curve of firing rate versus input 
current. However, such gain changes in vivo are measured in the curve of firing 
rate versus stimulus parameter. We find that when this curve is considered, and 
when the nonlinear relationships between stimulus parameter and input current 
and between input current and firing rate in vivo are taken into account, then 
simple excitation or inhibition alone can induce a multiplicative gain change. 
In particular, the power-law relationship between voltage and firing rate that 
is induced by neuronal noise is critical to this result. This suggests an 
unexpectedly simple mechanism that may underlie the gain modulations commonly 
observed in cortex. More generally, it suggests that a smaller input will 
multiplicatively modulate the gain of a larger one when both converge on a 
common cortical target.}, institution = {Graduate Group in Biophysics, W. M.

 = {Homeostatic intrinsic plasticity (HIP) is a ubiquitous cellular mechanism 
regulating neuronal activity, cardinal for the proper functioning of nervous 
systems. In invertebrates, HIP is critical for orchestrating stereotyped 
activity patterns. The functional impact of HIP remains more obscure in 
vertebrate networks, where higher order cognitive processes rely on complex 
neural dynamics. The hypothesis has emerged that HIP might control the 
complexity of activity dynamics in recurrent networks, with important 
computational consequences. However, conflicting results about the causal 
relationships between cellular HIP, network dynamics, and computational 
performance have arisen from machine-learning studies. Here, we assess how 
cellular HIP effects translate into collective dynamics and computational 
properties in biological recurrent networks. We develop a realistic multiscale 
model including a generic HIP rule regulating the neuronal threshold with actual 
molecular signaling pathways kinetics, Dale's principle, sparse connectivity, 
synaptic balance, and Hebbian synaptic plasticity (SP). Dynamic mean-field 
analysis and simulations unravel that HIP sets a working point at which inputs 
are transduced by large derivative ranges of the transfer function. This 
cellular mechanism ensures increased network dynamics complexity, robust balance 
with SP at the edge of chaos, and improved input separability. Although 
critically dependent upon balanced excitatory and inhibitory drives, these 
effects display striking robustness to changes in network architecture, learning 
rates, and input features. Thus, the mechanism we unveil might represent a 
ubiquitous cellular basis for complex dynamics in neural networks. Understanding 
this robustness is an important challenge to unraveling principles underlying 
self-organization around criticality in biological recurrent neural networks.},

of the protein synthesis-dependent maintenance of CA1-LTP (late-LTP) by 
activating the cAMP/PKA-pathway. In earlier studies we had reported a 
synergistic interaction of D1/D5-receptor function and N-methyl-D-aspartate

model for memory consolidation? In: Richter, D. (Ed.), Cell Polarity and

Interestingly, the short-term application of D1/D5-receptor agonists (SKF38393 
or 6-bromo-APB, 50 microM) can induce a slow-onset potentiation. This 
D1/D5-agonist-induced delayed-onset potentiation (D1/D5-LTP) resembles late-LTP, 
i.e. it is dependent on protein synthesis in the CA1 of rat hippocampal slices 
in vitro. The question arises as to whether D1/D5-LTP also requires 
glutamatergic stimulation, i.e. NMDA-receptor activation. We provide first 
evidence that a synergistic role of D1/D5- as well as NMDA-receptor-function is 
required in mediating processes relevant for the maintenance of this protein

  abstract    = {Rolipram, a selective inhibitor of cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4), 
has been shown to reinforce an early form of long-term potentiation (LTP) to a 
long-lasting LTP (late LTP). Furthermore, it was shown that the effects of 
rolipram-mediated reinforcement of LTP interacts with processes of synaptic 
tagging (Navakkode et al., 2004). Here we show in CA1 hippocampal slices from 
adult rats in vitro that rolipram also converted an early form of long-term 
depression (LTD) that normally decays within 2-3 h, to a long-lasting LTD (late 
LTD) if rolipram was applied during LTD-induction. Rolipram-reinforced LTD 
(RLTD) was NMDA receptor- and protein synthesis-dependent. Furthermore, it was 
dependent on the synergistic coactivation of dopaminergic D(1) and D(5) 
receptors. This let us speculate that RLTD resembles electrically induced, 
conventional CA1 late LTD, which is characterized by heterosynaptic processes 
and synaptic tagging. We therefore asked whether synaptic tagging occurs during 
RLTD. We found that early LTD in an S1 synaptic input was transformed into late 
LTD if early LTD was induced in a second independent S2 synaptic pathway during 
the inhibition of PDE by rolipram, supporting the interaction of processes of 
synaptic tagging during RLTD. Furthermore, application of PD 98059 
(2'-amino-3'-methoxyflavone) or U0126 
(1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis[2-aminophenylthio]butadiene), specific 
inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), prevented RLTD, 
suggesting a pivotal role of MAPK activation for RLTD. This MAPK activation was 
triggered during RLTD by the synergistic interaction of NMDA receptor- and D(1) 
and D(5) receptor-mediated Rap/B-Raf pathways, but not by the Ras/Raf-1 pathway 
in adult hippocampal CA1 neurons, as shown by the use of the pathway-specific 
inhibitors manumycin (Ras/Raf-1) and lethal toxin 82 (Rap/B-Raf).},

  Abstract                 = {Basal dendrites receive the majority of synapses 
that contact neocortical pyramidal neurons, yet our knowledge of synaptic 
processing in these dendrites has been hampered by their inaccessibility for 
electrical recordings. A new approach to patch-clamp recordings enabled us to 
characterize the integrative properties of these cells. Despite the short 
physical length of rat basal dendrites, synaptic inputs were electrotonically 
remote from the soma (>30-fold excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) 
attenuation) and back-propagating action potentials were significantly 
attenuated. Unitary EPSPs were location dependent, reaching large amplitudes 
distally (>8 mV), yet their somatic contribution was relatively location 
independent. Basal dendrites support sodium and NMDA spikes, but not calcium 
spikes, for 75\% of their length. This suggests that basal dendrites, despite 
their proximity to the site of action potential initiation, do not form a single 
basal-somatic region but rather should be considered as a separate integrative 
compartment favoring two integration modes: subthreshold, location-independent 
summation versus local amplification of incoming spatiotemporally clustered 
information.}, Bdsk-url-1               = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nn1826},

  Abstract                 = {Calcium is a second messenger, which can trigger 
the modification of synaptic efficacy. We investigated the question of whether a 
differential rise in postsynaptic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) alone is sufficient to account 
for the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) 
of EPSPs in the basal dendrites of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons of the 
somatosensory cortex. Volume-averaged [Ca2+]i transients were measured in spines 
of the basal dendritic arbor for spike-timing-dependent plasticity induction 
protocols. The rise in [Ca2+]i was uncorrelated to the direction of the change 
in synaptic efficacy, because several pairing protocols evoked similar spine 
[Ca2+]i transients but resulted in either LTP or LTD. The sequence dependence of 
near-coincident presynaptic and postsynaptic activity on the direction of 
changes in synaptic strength suggested that LTP and LTD were induced by two 
processes, which were controlled separately by postsynaptic [Ca2+]i levels. 
Activation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels before metabotropic glutamate 
receptors (mGluRs) resulted in the phospholipase C-dependent (PLC-dependent) 
synthesis of endocannabinoids, which acted as a retrograde messenger to induce 
LTD. LTP required a large [Ca2+]i transient evoked by NMDA receptor activation. 
Blocking mGluRs abolished the induction of LTD and uncovered the Ca2+-dependent 
induction of LTP. We conclude that the volume-averaged peak elevation of [Ca2+]i 
in spines of layer 2/3 pyramids determines the magnitude of long-term changes in 
synaptic efficacy. The direction of the change is controlled, however, via a 
mGluR-coupled signaling cascade. mGluRs act in conjunction with PLC as 
sequence-sensitive coincidence detectors when postsynaptic precede presynaptic 
action potentials to induce LTD. Thus presumably two different Ca2+ sensors in 
spines control the induction of spike-timing-dependent synaptic plasticity.},

time scales involving a fast voltage variable and a slow recovery variable, 
which represents the fraction of open potassium channels. In the stochastic 
setting, spontaneous excitation is initiated by ion channel noise. If the 
recovery variable is constant during initiation, the spontaneous activity rate 
can be calculated using Kramer's rate theory. The validity of this assumption in 
the stochastic model is examined using a systematic perturbation analysis. We 
find that, in most physically relevant cases, this assumption breaks down, 
requiring an alternative to Kramer's theory for excitable systems with one 
deterministic fixed point. We also show that an exit time problem can be 
formulated in an excitable system by considering maximum likelihood trajectories

occur at central synapses. Fast-rising EPSCs are thought to be mediated by rapid 
local release of glutamate. However, two controversial mechanisms have been 
proposed to underlie slow-rising EPSCs: prolonged local release of transmitter 
via a fusion pore, and spillover of transmitter released rapidly from distant 
sites. We have investigated the mechanism underlying slow-rising EPSCs and the 
diffusion coefficient of glutamate in the synaptic cleft (Dglut) at cerebellar 
mossy fiber-granule cell synapses using a combination of diffusion modeling and 
patch-clamp recording. Simulations show that modulating Dglut has different 
effects on the peak amplitudes and time courses of EPSCs mediated by these two 
mechanisms. Slowing diffusion with the macromolecule dextran slowed slow-rising 
EPSCs and had little effect on their amplitude, indicating that glutamate 
spillover underlies these currents. Our results also suggest that under control 
conditions Dglut is approximately 3-fold lower than in free solution.},

absence of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). Reports that 
patients and adult FMR1 knock-out mice have abnormally long dendritic spines of 
increased density suggested that the disorder might involve abnormal spine 
development. Because spine length, density, and motility change dramatically in 
the first postnatal weeks, we analyzed these properties in mutant mice and 
littermate controls at 1, 2, and 4 weeks of age. To label neurons, a viral 
vector carrying the enhanced green fluorescent protein gene was injected into 
the barrel cortex. Layer V neurons were imaged on a two-photon laser scanning 
microscope in fixed tissue sections. Analysis of >16,000 spines showed clear 
developmental patterns. Between 1 and 4 weeks of age, spine density increased 
2.5-fold, and mean spine length decreased by 17\% in normal animals. Early 
during cortical synaptogenesis, pyramidal cells in mutant mice had longer spines 
than controls. At 1 week, spine length was 28\% greater in mutants than in 
controls. At 2 weeks, this difference was 10\%, and at 4 weeks only 3\%. 
Similarly, spine density was 33\% greater in mutants than in controls at 1 week 
of age. At 2 or 4 weeks of age, differences were not detectable. The spine 
abnormality was not detected in neocortical organotypic cultures. The transient 
nature of the spine abnormality in the intact animal suggests that FMRP might 
play a role in the normal process of dendritic spine growth in coordination with 
the experience-dependent development of cortical circuits.}, institution =

CA1 pyramidal neurons in acute hippocampal slices. Two-photon uncaging and Ca2+ 
imaging revealed that NMDAR-mediated currents increased with spine-head volume 
and that even the smallest spines contained a significant number of NMDARs. The 
fate of Ca2+ that entered spine heads through NMDARs was governed by the shape 
(length and radius) of the spine neck. Larger spines had necks that permitted 
greater efflux of Ca2+ into the dendritic shaft, whereas smaller spines 
manifested a larger increase in [Ca2+]i within the spine compartment as a result 
of a smaller Ca2+ flux through the neck. Spine-neck geometry is thus an 
important determinant of spine Ca2+ signaling, allowing small spines to be the 
preferential sites for isolated induction of long-term potentiation.},

changes in spine size will modify spine Ca?? concentrations during subsequent 
synaptic activation. We show that the relationship between Ca?? influx and spine 
volume is a fundamental determinant of synaptic stability. If Ca?? influx is 
undercompensated for increases in spine size, then strong synapses are 
stabilized and synaptic strength distributions have a single peak. In contrast, 
overcompensation of Ca?? influx leads to binary, persistent synaptic strengths 
with double-peaked distributions. Biophysical simulations predict that CA1 
pyramidal neuron spines are undercompensating. This unifies experimental 
findings that weak synapses are more plastic than strong synapses, that synaptic 
strengths are unimodally distributed, and that potentiation saturates for a 
given stimulus strength. We conclude that structural plasticity provides a 
simple, local, and general mechanism that allows dendritic spines to foster both

between neurons. Both of these changes caused by lateral connections have to be 
taken into consideration to correctly evaluate their effects. We propose a 
theoretical framework for analytically computing the Fisher information, which 
measures the accuracy of a population code, in stochastic spiking neuron models 
with refractory periods. Within our framework, we accurately evaluated both the 
changes in tuning curves and correlations caused by lateral connections and 
their effects on the Fisher information. We found that their effects conflicted 
with each other and the answer to whether or not the lateral connections 
increased the Fisher information strongly depended on the intrinsic properties 
of the model neuron. By systematically changing the coupling strengths of 
excitations and inhibitions, we found the parameter regions of lateral 
connectivities where sharpening of tuning curves through Mexican-hat 
connectivities led to an increase in information, which is in contrast to some 
previous findings.}, institution = {Department of Complexity Science and

been found to signal the presence of a salient stimulus among multiple items in 
a display, spatial summation within their receptive field in the absence of an 
attentional bias has never been investigated. This information, however, is 
indispensable when one investigates the mechanisms of spatial attention and 
competition between multiple visual objects. To examine the spatial summation 
rule in parietal area 7a neurons, we trained rhesus monkeys to fixate on a 
central cross while two identical stimuli were briefly displayed in a neuron's 
receptive field. The response to a pair of dots was compared with the responses 
to the same dots when they were presented individually. The scaling and power 
parameters of a generalized summation algorithm varied greatly, both across 
neurons and across combinations of stimulus locations. However, the averaged 
response of the recorded population of 7a neurons was consistent with a 
winner-take-all rule for spatial summation. A control experiment where a monkey 
covertly attended to both stimuli simultaneously suggests that attention 
introduces additional competition by facilitating the less optimal stimulus. 
Thus an averaging stage is introduced between ? 200 and 300 ms of the response 
to a pair of stimuli. In short, the summation algorithm over the population of 
area 7a neurons carries the signature of a winner-take-all operation, with 
spatial attention possibly influencing the temporal dynamics of stimulus 
competition, that is the moment that the "winner" takes "victory" over the 
"loser" stimulus.}, bdsk-url-1  = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/jn.00907.2010}, doi

established that foveating a behaviorally relevant part of the visual field 
improves localization performance as compared to the situation where the gaze is 
directed elsewhere. Reduced localization performance in the peripheral encoding 
conditions has been attributed to an eccentricity-dependent increase in 
positional uncertainty. It is not known, however, whether and how the foveal and 
peripheral encoding conditions can influence spatial interval estimation. In 
this study we compare observers' estimates of a distance between two co-planar 
dots in the condition where they foveate the two sample dots and where they 
fixate a central dot while viewing the sample dots peripherally.Observers were 
required to reproduce, after a short delay, a distance between two sample dots 
based on a stationary reference dot and a movable mouse pointer. When both 
sample dots are foveated, we find that the distance estimation error is small 
but consistently increases with the dots-separation size. In comparison, 
distance judgment in peripheral encoding condition is significantly 
overestimated for smaller separations and becomes similar to the performance in 
foveal trials for distances from 10 to 16 degrees.Although we find improved 
accuracy of distance estimation in the foveal condition, the fact that the 
difference is related to the reduction of the estimation bias present in the 
peripheral condition, challenges the simple account of reducing the 
eccentricity-dependent positional uncertainty. Contrary to this, we present 
evidence for an explanation in terms of neuronal populations activated by the 
two sample dots and their inhibitory interactions under different visual 
encoding conditions. We support our claims with simulations that take into 
account receptive fields size differences between the two encoding conditions.},

localized, oriented, and bandpass, comparable with the basis functions of 
wavelet transforms. Previously, we have shown that these receptive field 
properties may be accounted for in terms of a strategy for producing a sparse 
distribution of output activity in response to natural images. Here, in addition 
to describing this work in a more expansive fashion, we examine the 
neurobiological implications of sparse coding. Of particular interest is the 
case when the code is overcomplete--i.e., when the number of code elements is 
greater than the effective dimensionality of the input space. Because the basis 
functions are non-orthogonal and not linearly independent of each other, 
sparsifying the code will recruit only those basis functions necessary for 
representing a given input, and so the input-output function will deviate from 
being purely linear. These deviations from linearity provide a potential 
explanation for the weak forms of non-linearity observed in the response 
properties of cortical simple cells, and they further make predictions about the 
expected interactions among units in response to naturalistic stimuli.},

adjust membrane excitability to changing intra- and extracellular conditions. 
Such activity-dependent homeostatic regulation (ADHR) is critical for normal 
processing of the nervous system and avoiding pathological conditions. Here, we 
posed a homeostatic regulation problem for the classical Morris-Lecar (ML) 
model. The problem was motivated by the phenomenon of the functional recovery of 
stomatogastric neurons in crustaceans in the absence of neuromodulation. In our 
study, the regulation of the ionic conductances in the ML model depended on the 
calcium current or the intracellular calcium concentration. We found an 
asymptotic solution to the problem under the assumption of slow regulation. The 
solution provides a full account of the regulation in the case of correlated or 
anticorrelated changes of the maximal conductances of the calcium and potassium 
currents. In particular, the solution shows how the target and parameters of the 
regulation determine which perturbations of the conductances can be compensated 
by the ADHR. In some cases, the sets of compensated initial perturbations are 
not convex. On the basis of our analysis we formulated specific questions for 
subsequent experimental and theoretical studies of ADHR.}, bdsk-url-1  =

Neurophysiological recordings from neurones in inferior temporal cortex (IT) and

with decreasing stimulus contrast is considerably greater in higher visual areas 
than that seen in primary visual cortex. This suggests that the majority of the 
latency change is not retinal or V1 in origin, instead each cortical processing 
area adds latency at low contrast. I show that, as in earlier visual areas, 
response latency is more strongly dependent on stimulus contrast than stimulus 
identity. There is large variation in the extent to which response latency 
increases with decreasing stimulus contrast. I show that this between cell 
variability is, at least in part, related to the stimulus specificity of the

greater for neurones that respond to few stimuli compared to neurones that

magnitude and time course of response were made from 44 cells responsive to

responses to complex stimulus patterns evoking good, poor, and midrange

good and poor initial discrimination between head views were found at short and 
long latencies; there was no correlation of any of the temporal response 
parameters measured with cell response latency. 3. The time course of the 
population response to the most effective stimuli showed a rapid increase to a 
peak firing rate (onset to peak, rise time, 58 ms) that was on average 115 
spikes/s above spontaneous activity (S/A), followed by slower decay (decay time, 
93 ms) to a maintained discharge rate (15\% of the peak rate above S/A). 4. 
Discrimination between responses to different head views exhibited by the 
population showed a sharp rise and reached highly significant levels within 25 
ms after the population's response onset. 5. On average, activity in a single 
neuron (the Average Cell) rises to 44\% of its peak response rate within 5 ms of 
the response onset. 6. The Average Cell also showed exceptionally fast 
discrimination between views, significant within 5 ms of response onset. 7. It 
is argued that the fast rise in firing rate, followed by a decay to a lower rate 
and the very fast emergence of discrimination are features of pattern processing 
present in real neural systems that are lacking in many processing models based 
on artificial networks of neuronlike elements, particularly those where 
discrimination relies on top-down and/or lateral competitive inhibition. 8. It 
is concluded that the only way to account for the rapid discrimination is to 
consider a coding system in which the first spike from multiple sources is used 
to transmit information between stages of processing.}, keywords  = {Animals;

the stochastic opening and closing of ion channels (channel noise) with the 
non-linear neural dynamics are essential to our understanding of the operation

dynamics are generally studied using numerical simulations of stochastic models. 
Algorithms based on discrete Markov Chains (MC) seem to be the most reliable and 
trustworthy, but even optimized algorithms come with a non-negligible 
computational cost. Diffusion Approximation (DA) methods use Stochastic 
Differential Equations (SDE) to approximate the behavior of a number of MCs, 
considerably speeding up simulation times. However, model comparisons have 
suggested that DA methods did not lead to the same results as in MC modeling in 
terms of channel noise statistics and effects on excitability. Recently, it was 
shown that the difference arose because MCs were modeled with coupled gating 
particles, while the DA was modeled using uncoupled gating particles. 
Implementations of DA with coupled particles, in the context of a specific 
kinetic scheme, yielded similar results to MC. However, it remained unclear how 
to generalize these implementations to different kinetic schemes, or whether 
they were faster than MC algorithms. Additionally, a steady state approximation 
was used for the stochastic terms, which, as we show here, can introduce 
significant inaccuracies.We derived the SDE explicitly for any given ion channel 
kinetic scheme. The resulting generic equations were surprisingly simple and 
interpretable--allowing an easy, transparent and efficient DA implementation, 
avoiding unnecessary approximations. The algorithm was tested in a voltage clamp 
simulation and in two different current clamp simulations, yielding the same 
results as MC modeling. Also, the simulation efficiency of this DA method 
demonstrated considerable superiority over MC methods, except when short time 
steps or low channel numbers were used.}, bdsk-url-1  =

surround stimulus. Instead, suppression is mediated by a withdrawal of 
excitation. Thalamic recordings and previous work show that these effects cannot 
be explained by a withdrawal of thalamic input. We find in theoretical work that 
this behavior can only arise if V1 operates as an inhibition-stabilized network 
(ISN), in which excitatory recurrence alone is strong enough to destabilize 
visual responses but feedback inhibition maintains stability. We confirm two 
strong tests of this scenario experimentally and show through simulation that

inactivation of the X-linked fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. FXS is 
associated with increased density and abnormal morphology of dendritic spines, 
the postsynaptic sites of the majority of excitatory synapses. To better 
understand how lack of the FMR1 gene function affects spine development and 
plasticity, we examined spine formation and elimination of layer 5 pyramidal 
neurons in the whisker barrel cortex of Fmr1 KO mice with a transcranial 
two-photon imaging technique. We found that the rates of spine formation and 
elimination over days to weeks were significantly higher in both young and adult 
KO mice compared with littermate controls. The heightened spine turnover in KO 
mice was due to the existence of a larger pool of "short-lived" new spines in KO 
mice than in controls. Furthermore, we found that the formation of new spines 
and the elimination of existing ones were less sensitive to modulation by 
sensory experience in KO mice. These results indicate that the loss of Fmr1 gene 
function leads to ongoing overproduction of transient spines in the primary 
somatosensory cortex. The insensitivity of spine formation and elimination to 
sensory alterations in Fmr1 KO mice suggest that the developing synaptic 
circuits may not be properly tuned by sensory stimuli in FXS.}, bdsk-url-1  =

quantification of how much information a neuronal response carries about 
external stimuli and is hence a natural analytic framework for studying neural

is that estimates of neuronal information from experimental data are prone to a 
systematic error (called "bias"). This bias is an inevitable consequence of the 
limited number of stimulus-response samples that it is possible to record in a 
real experiment. In this paper, we first explain the origin and the implications 
of the bias problem in spike train analysis. We then review and evaluate some 
recent general-purpose methods to correct for sampling bias: the Panzeri-Treves, 
Quadratic Extrapolation, Best Universal Bound, Nemenman-Shafee-Bialek 
procedures, and a recently proposed shuffling bias reduction procedure. Finally, 
we make practical recommendations for the accurate computation of information 
from spike trains. Our main recommendation is to estimate information using the 
shuffling bias reduction procedure in combination with one of the other four 
general purpose bias reduction procedures mentioned in the preceding text. This 
provides information estimates with acceptable variance and which are unbiased 
even when the number of trials per stimulus is as small as the number of 
possible discrete neuronal responses.}, bdsk-url-1  =

  Abstract                 = {N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are 
glutamate-gated ion channels widely expressed in the central nervous system that 
play key roles in excitatory synaptic transmission. Because of their involvement 
in numerous neurological disorders, NMDARs are also targets of therapeutic 
interest. NMDARs occur as multiple subtypes which differ in their subunit 
composition and in their biophysical and pharmacological properties. In 
particular, NMDARs contain a diversity of sites at which endogenous ligands or 
pharmacological agents can act to modulate receptor activity in a 
subunit-selective manner, and recent structural and functional data have started 
to reveal the molecular determinants for this subunit selectivity. These include 
the binding sites for glutamate, the ion-channel pore and the recently 
identified allosteric sites on the N-terminal domain. Other potential sites yet 
unexplored by medicinal chemistry programs are also considered, in particular at 
the interface between subunits. Given the growing body of evidence that diverse 
brain disorders implicate different NMDAR subtypes, such as NR2B in pain or NR3A 
in white matter injury, there is a growing interest in exploiting the 
pharmacological heterogeneity of NMDARs for the development of novel NMDAR 
subtype-selective compounds.}, Bdsk-url-1               =

shape recognition in primates depends on a multi-stage pathway running from 
primary visual cortex (V1) to inferotemporal cortex (IT). The mechanisms by 
which local shape signals from V1 are transformed into selectivity for abstract 
object categories in IT are unknown. One approach to this issue is to 
investigate shape representation at intermediate stages in the pathway, such as 
area V4. We studied 109 V4 cells that appeared sensitive to complex shape in 
preliminary tests. To achieve a more complete picture of shape representation in 
V4, we tested each cell with a set of 366 stimuli, constructed by systematically 
combining convex and concave boundary elements into closed shapes. Using this 
large, diverse stimulus set, we found that all the cells in our sample responded 
to a wide variety of shapes and did not appear to encode any single type of 
global shape. However, for most cells the shapes evoking strongest responses 
were characterized by a consistent type of boundary conformation at a specific 
position within the stimulus. For example, a given cell might be tuned for 
shapes containing concave curvature at the right, with other parts of the shape 
having little or no effect on responses. Many cells were tuned for more complex 
boundary configurations (e.g., a convex angle adjacent to a concave curve). We 
quantified this kind of shape tuning with Gaussian functions on a curvature x 
position domain. These tuning functions fit the neural responses much better 
than tuning functions based on edge or axis orientation. Thus individual V4 
cells appear to encode moderately complex boundary information at specific 
locations within larger shapes. This finding suggests that, at intermediate 
stages in the V1-IT transformation, complex objects are represented at least 
partly in terms of the configurations and positions of their contour 
components.}, institution = {Department of Biomedical Engineering, Baltimore,

{Neuronal circuitry is often considered a clean slate that can be dynamically 
and arbitrarily molded by experience. However, when we investigated synaptic 
connectivity in groups of pyramidal neurons in the neocortex, we found that both 
connectivity and synaptic weights were surprisingly predictable. Synaptic 
weights follow very closely the number of connections in a group of neurons, 
saturating after only 20\% of possible connections are formed between neurons in 
a group. When we examined the network topology of connectivity between neurons, 
we found that the neurons cluster into small world networks that are not 
scale-free, with less than 2 degrees of separation. We found a simple clustering 
rule where connectivity is directly proportional to the number of common 
neighbors, which accounts for these small world networks and accurately predicts 
the connection probability between any two neurons. This pyramidal neuron 
network clusters into multiple groups of a few dozen neurons each. The neurons 
composing each group are surprisingly distributed, typically more than 100 ?m 
apart, allowing for multiple groups to be interlaced in the same space. In 
summary, we discovered a synaptic organizing principle that groups neurons in a 
manner that is common across animals and hence, independent of individual 
experiences. We speculate that these elementary neuronal groups are prescribed 
Lego-like building blocks of perception and that acquired memory relies more on 
combining these elementary assemblies into higher-order constructs.}, bdsk-url-1

selectivity for faces in cell responses. We then focus on (c) the comparison of 
perception and cell responses to images of faces presented in sequences of 
unrelated images. Specifically the paper concerns the cell function and 
perception in circumstances where meaningful patterns occur momentarily in the 
context of a naturally or unnaturally changing visual environment. Experience of 
visual sequences allows anticipation, yet one sensory stimulus also "masks" 
perception and neural processing of subsequent stimuli. To understand this 
paradox we compared cell responses in monkey temporal cortex to body images 
presented individually, in pairs and in action sequences. Responses to one image 
suppressed responses to similar images for approximately 500 ms. This 
suppression led to responses peaking 100 ms earlier to image sequences than to 
isolated images (e.g., during head rotation, face-selective activity peaks 
before the face confronts the observer). Thus forward masking has unrecognized 
benefits for perception because it can transform neuronal activity to make it 
predictive during natural change.}, bdsk-url-1  =

exhibited selectivity for face identity or species. Tuning to view varied in 
sharpness. For most (54/73) cells the angle of perspective rotation reducing 
response to half maximal was 45-70 degrees but for 19/73 it was greater than 90 
degrees. More cells were optimally tuned to characteristic views of the head

cells' responses to faces (real or projected, human or rhesus monkey) were two

complex 3-D objects. (2) Neuronal responses to faces were excitatory, sustained 
and were time-locked to the stimulus presentation with a latency of between 80

to the sight of arousing or aversive stimuli. (4) The magnitude of the responses 
of 28 cells tested was relatively constant despite transformations, such as 
rotation, so that the face was inverted or horizontal, and alterations of 
colour, size or distance. (5) Rotation to profile substantially reduced the 
responses of 21 cells (31 tested). (6) Masking out or presenting parts of the

responded to different features or subsets of features. (7) For several cells, 
responses to the normal organisation of cut-out or line-drawn facial features 
were significantly larger than to jumbled controls. These findings indicate that 
explanations in terms of arousal, emotional or motor reactions, simple visual 
feature sensitivity or receptive fields are insufficient to account for the 
selective responses to faces and face features observed in this population of 
STS neurones. It appears that these neurones are part of a system specialised to 
code for faces or features present in faces, and it is suggested that damage to 
this system is related to prosopagnosia, or difficulty in face recognition, in 
man and to the tameness and social disturbances which follow temporal lobe

cortex in primates develop edge-like receptive fields. One approach to 
understanding the emergence of this response is to state that neural activity 
has to efficiently represent sensory data with respect to the statistics of 
natural scenes. Furthermore, it is believed that such an efficient coding is 
achieved using a competition across neurons so as to generate a sparse 
representation, that is, where a relatively small number of neurons are 
simultaneously active. Indeed, different models of sparse coding, coupled with 
Hebbian learning and homeostasis, have been proposed that successfully match the 
observed emergent response. However, the specific role of homeostasis in 
learning such sparse representations is still largely unknown. By quantitatively 
assessing the efficiency of the neural representation during learning, we derive 
a cooperative homeostasis mechanism that optimally tunes the competition between 
neurons within the sparse coding algorithm. We apply this homeostasis while 
learning small patches taken from natural images and compare its efficiency with 
state-of-the-art algorithms. Results show that while different sparse coding 
algorithms give similar coding results, the homeostasis provides an optimal 
balance for the representation of natural images within the population of 
neurons. Competition in sparse coding is optimized when it is fair. By 
contributing to optimizing statistical competition across neurons, homeostasis 
is crucial in providing a more efficient solution to the emergence of 
independent components.}, bdsk-url-1  =

Fmr1 gene, which encodes the RNA binding protein, fragile X mental retardation 
protein (FMRP). Therefore, FXS is a tractable model to understand synaptic 
dysfunction in cognitive disorders. FMRP is present at synapses where it 
associates with mRNA and polyribosomes. Accumulating evidence finds roles for 
FMRP in synapse development, elimination, and plasticity. Here, the authors

what is known about the molecular function of FMRP. Recent advances in the

  Abstract                 = {In timing-based neural codes, neurons have to emit 
action potentials at precise moments in time. We use a supervised learning 
paradigm to derive a synaptic update rule that optimizes by gradient ascent the 
likelihood of postsynaptic firing at one or several desired firing times. We 
find that the optimal strategy of up- and downregulating synaptic efficacies 
depends on the relative timing between presynaptic spike arrival and desired 
postsynaptic firing. If the presynaptic spike arrives before the desired 
postsynaptic spike timing, our optimal learning rule predicts that the synapse 
should become potentiated. The dependence of the potentiation on spike timing 
directly reflects the time course of an excitatory postsynaptic potential. 
However, our approach gives no unique reason for synaptic depression under 
reversed spike timing. In fact, the presence and amplitude of depression of 
synaptic efficacies for reversed spike timing depend on how constraints are 
implemented in the optimization problem. Two different constraints, control of 
postsynaptic rates and control of temporal locality, are studied. The relation 
of our results to spike-timing-dependent plasticity and reinforcement learning 
is discussed.}, Bdsk-url-1               =

poorly understood. Using a detailed compartmental model of a hippocampal CA1 
pyramidal cell, we recorded responses to complex stimuli consisting of dozens of 
high-frequency activated synapses distributed throughout the apical dendrites. 
We found the cell's firing rate could be predicted by a simple formula that maps 
the physical components of the cell onto those of an abstract two-layer "neural 
network." In the first layer, synaptic inputs drive independent sigmoidal 
subunits corresponding to the cell's several dozen long, thin terminal 
dendrites. The subunit outputs are then summed within the main trunk and cell 
body prior to final thresholding. We conclude that insofar as the neural code is 
mediated by average firing rate, a two-layer neural network may provide a useful 
abstraction for the computing function of the individual pyramidal neuron.},

  Abstract                 = {It is well established that synaptic transmission 
declines at temperatures below physiological, but many in vitro studies are 
conducted at lower temperatures. Recent evidence suggests that 
temperature-dependent changes in presynaptic mechanisms remain in overall 
equilibrium and have little effect on transmitter release at low transmission 
frequencies. Our objective was to examine the postsynaptic effects of 
temperature. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from principal neurons in the 
medial nucleus of the trapezoid body showed that a rise from 25 degrees C to 35 
degrees C increased miniature EPSC (mEPSC) amplitude from -33 +/- 2.3 to -46 +/- 
5.7 pA (n=6) and accelerated mEPSC kinetics. Evoked EPSC amplitude increased 
from -3.14 +/- 0.59 to -4.15 +/- 0.73 nA with the fast decay time constant 
accelerating from 0.75 +/- 0.09 ms at 25 degrees C to 0.56 +/- 0.08 ms at 35 
degrees C. Direct application of glutamate produced currents which similarly 
increased in amplitude from -0.76 +/- 0.10 nA at 25 degrees C to -1.11 +/- 0.19 
nA 35 degrees C. Kinetic modelling of fast AMPA receptors showed that a 
temperature-dependent scaling of all reaction rate constants by a single 
multiplicative factor (Q10=2.4) drives AMPA channels with multiple 
subconductances into the higher-conducting states at higher temperature. 
Furthermore, Monte Carlo simulation and deconvolution analysis of transmission 
at the calyx of Held showed that this acceleration of the receptor kinetics 
explained the temperature dependence of both the mEPSC and evoked EPSC. We 
propose that acceleration in postsynaptic AMPA receptor kinetics, rather than 
altered presynaptic release, is the primary mechanism by which temperature 
changes alter synaptic responses at low frequencies.}, Bdsk-url-1

pages       = {e1000207}, abstract    = {BACKGROUND: Accurate measures of the 
severity of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza (pH1N1) are needed to assess the 
likely impact of an anticipated resurgence in the autumn in the Northern 
Hemisphere. Severity has been difficult to measure because jurisdictions with 
large numbers of deaths and other severe outcomes have had too many cases to 
assess the total number with confidence. Also, detection of severe cases may be 
more likely, resulting in overestimation of the severity of an average case. We 
sought to estimate the probabilities that symptomatic infection would lead to 
hospitalization, ICU admission, and death by combining data from multiple 
sources. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used complementary data from two US cities: 
Milwaukee attempted to identify cases of medically attended infection whether or 
not they required hospitalization, while New York City focused on the 
identification of hospitalizations, intensive care admission or mechanical 
ventilation (hereafter, ICU), and deaths. New York data were used to estimate 
numerators for ICU and death, and two sources of data--medically attended cases 
in Milwaukee or self-reported influenza-like illness (ILI) in New York--were 
used to estimate ratios of symptomatic cases to hospitalizations. Combining 
these data with estimates of the fraction detected for each level of severity, 
we estimated the proportion of symptomatic patients who died (symptomatic 
case-fatality ratio, sCFR), required ICU (sCIR), and required hospitalization 
(sCHR), overall and by age category. Evidence, prior information, and associated 
uncertainty were analyzed in a Bayesian evidence synthesis framework. Using 
medically attended cases and estimates of the proportion of symptomatic cases 
medically attended, we estimated an sCFR of 0.048\% (95\% credible interval [CI] 
0.026\%-0.096\%), sCIR of 0.239\% (0.134\%-0.458\%), and sCHR of 1.44\% 
(0.83\%-2.64\%). Using self-reported ILI, we obtained estimates approximately 
7-9 x lower. sCFR and sCIR appear to be highest in persons aged 18 y and older, 
and lowest in children aged 5-17 y. sCHR appears to be lowest in persons aged 
5-17; our data were too sparse to allow us to determine the group in which it 
was the highest. CONCLUSIONS: These estimates suggest that an autumn-winter 
pandemic wave of pH1N1 with comparable severity per case could lead to a number 
of deaths in the range from considerably below that associated with seasonal 
influenza to slightly higher, but with the greatest impact in children aged 0-4 
and adults 18-64. These estimates of impact depend on assumptions about total 
incidence of infection and would be larger if incidence of symptomatic infection 
were higher or shifted toward adults, if viral virulence increased, or if 
suboptimal treatment resulted from stress on the health care system; numbers 
would decrease if the total proportion of the population symptomatically 
infected were lower than assumed.}, bdsk-url-1  =

Furthermore, they have provided new insights into how interactions between the 
hippocampus and prefrontal cortex support the assimilation of new memories into 
pre-existing networks of knowledge, called schemas, and how schemas are modified 
in this process as the foundation of memory consolidation.}, Citation-subset

  Abstract                 = {Local neocortical circuits are characterized by 
stereotypical physiological and structural features that subserve generic 
computational operations. These basic computations of the cortical microcircuit 
emerge through the interplay of neuronal connectivity, cellular intrinsic 
properties, and synaptic plasticity dynamics. How these interacting mechanisms 
generate specific computational operations in the cortical circuit remains 
largely unknown. Here, we identify the neurophysiological basis of both the rate 
of change and anticipation computations on synaptic inputs in a cortical 
circuit. Through biophysically realistic computer simulations and neuronal 
recordings, we show that the rate-of-change computation is operated robustly in 
cortical networks through the combination of two ubiquitous brain mechanisms: 
short-term synaptic depression and spike-frequency adaptation. We then show how 
this rate-of-change circuit can be embedded in a convergently connected network 
to anticipate temporally incoming synaptic inputs, in quantitative agreement 
with experimental findings on anticipatory responses to moving stimuli in the 
primary visual cortex. Given the robustness of the mechanism and the widespread 
nature of the physiological machinery involved, we suggest that rate-of-change 
computation and temporal anticipation are principal, hard-wired functions of 
neural information processing in the cortical microcircuit.}, Bdsk-url-1

representation is achieved by neurons in the human brain is still unclear. In 
monkeys, neurons in the upper stages of the ventral visual pathway respond to 
complex images such as faces and objects and show some degree of invariance to 
metric properties such as the stimulus size, position and viewing angle. We have 
previously shown that neurons in the human medial temporal lobe (MTL) fire 
selectively to images of faces, animals, objects or scenes. Here we report on a 
remarkable subset of MTL neurons that are selectively activated by strikingly 
different pictures of given individuals, landmarks or objects and in some cases 
even by letter strings with their names. These results suggest an invariant, 
sparse and explicit code, which might be important in the transformation of 
complex visual percepts into long-term and more abstract memories.},

  Abstract                 = {We have used Monte Carlo simulations to understand 
the generation of quantal responses at the single active zones of CA1 synapses. 
We constructed a model of AMPA channel activation that accounts for the 
responses to controlled glutamate application and a model of glutamate diffusion 
in the synaptic cleft. With no further adjustments to these models, we simulated 
the response to the release of glutamate from a single vesicle. The predicted 
response closely matches the rise time of observed responses, which recent 
measurements show is much faster (<100 micros) than previously thought. The 
simulations show that initial channel opening is driven by a brief (<100 micros) 
glutamate spike near the site of vesicle fusion, producing a hotspot of channel 
activation (diameter: approximately 250 nm) smaller than many synapses. Quantal 
size therefore depends more strongly on the density of channels than their 
number, a finding that has important implications for measuring synaptic 
strength. Recent measurements allow estimation of AMPA receptor density at CA1 
synapses. Using this value, our simulations correctly predicts a quantal 
amplitude of approximately 10 pA. We have also analyzed the properties of 
excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) generated by the multivesicular release 
that can occur during evoked responses. We find that summation is nearly linear 
and that the existence of multiple narrow peaks in amplitude histograms can be 
accounted for. It has been unclear how to reconcile the existence of these 
narrow peaks, which indicate that the variation of quantal amplitude is small 
(CV < 0.2) with the highly variable amplitude of miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs; CV 
approximately 0.6). According to one theory, mEPSC variability arises from 
variation in vesicle glutamate content. However, both our modeling results and 
recent experimental results indicate that this view cannot account for the 
observed rise time/amplitude correlation of mEPSCs. In contrast, this 
correlation and the high mEPSC variability can be accounted for if some mEPSCs 
are generated by two or more vesicles released with small temporal jitter. We 
conclude that a broad range of results can be accounted for by simple 
principles: quantal amplitude (approximately 10 pA) is stereotyped, some mEPSCs 
are multivesicular at moderate and large synapses, and evoked responses are 
generated by quasi-linear summation of multiple quanta.}, Bdsk-url-1

  Abstract                 = {Repetitive stimulation of synaptic connections in 
the cerebral cortex often induces short-term synaptic depression (STD), a 
property directly related to the probability of transmitter release and critical 
for the computational properties of the network. In order to explore how 
spontaneous activity in the network affects this property, we first studied STD 
in cortical slices that were either silent or that displayed spontaneous 
rhythmic slow oscillations resembling those recorded during slow wave sleep in 
vivo. STD was considerably reduced by the occurrence of spontaneous rhythmic 
activity in the cortical network. Once the rhythmic activity started, depression 
decreased over time in parallel with the duration and intensity of the ongoing 
activity until a plateau was reached. Thalamocortical and intracortical synaptic 
potentials studied in vivo also showed stronger depression in a silent than in 
an active cortical network, and the depression values in the active cortical 
network in vivo were indistinguishable from those found in active slices in

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The cerebral cortex is permanently 
active during both awake and sleep states. This ongoing cortical activity has an 
impact on synaptic transmission and short-term plasticity. An activity pattern 
generated by the cortical network is a slow rhythmic activity that alternates up 
(active) and down (silent) states, a pattern occurring during slow wave sleep, 
anesthesia and even in vitro. Here we have studied 1) how network activity 
affects short term synaptic plasticity and, 2) how synaptic transmission varies 
in up versus down states. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Intracellular 
recordings obtained from cortex in vitro and in vivo were used to record 
synaptic potentials, while presynaptic activation was achieved either with 
electrical or natural stimulation. Repetitive activation of layer 4 to layer 2/3 
synaptic connections from ferret visual cortex slices displayed synaptic 
augmentation that was larger and longer lasting in active than in silent slices. 
Paired-pulse facilitation was also significantly larger in an active network and 
it persisted for longer intervals (up to 200 ms) than in silent slices. 
Intracortical synaptic potentials occurring during up states in vitro increased 
their amplitude while paired-pulse facilitation disappeared. Both intracortical 
and thalamocortical synaptic potentials were also significantly larger in up 
than in down states in the cat visual cortex in vivo. These enhanced synaptic 
potentials did not further facilitate when pairs of stimuli were given, thus 
paired-pulse facilitation during up states in vivo was virtually absent. 
Visually induced synaptic responses displayed larger amplitudes when occurring 
during up versus down states. This was further tested in rat barrel cortex, 
where a sensory activated synaptic potential was also larger in up states. 
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results imply that synaptic transmission in an 
active cortical network is more secure and efficient due to larger amplitude of 
synaptic potentials and lesser short term plasticity.}, Bdsk-url-1

adjust their intrinsic excitability when experiencing a persistent change in 
synaptic drive. This process can prevent neural activity from moving into either 
a quiescent state or a saturated state in the face of ongoing plasticity, and is 
thought to promote stability of the network in which neurons reside. However, 
most neurons are embedded in recurrent networks, which require a delicate 
balance between excitation and inhibition to maintain network stability. This 
balance could be disrupted when neurons independently adjust their intrinsic 
excitability. Here, we study the functioning of activity-dependent homeostatic 
scaling of intrinsic excitability (HSE) in a recurrent neural network. Using 
both simulations of a recurrent network consisting of excitatory and inhibitory 
neurons that implement HSE, and a mean-field description of adapting excitatory 
and inhibitory populations, we show that the stability of such adapting networks 
critically depends on the relationship between the adaptation time scales of 
both neuron populations. In a stable adapting network, HSE can keep all neurons 
functioning within their dynamic range, while the network is undergoing several 
(patho)physiologically relevant types of plasticity, such as persistent changes 
in external drive, changes in connection strengths, or the loss of inhibitory 
cells from the network. However, HSE cannot prevent the unstable network 
dynamics that result when, due to such plasticity, recurrent excitation in the 
network becomes too strong compared to feedback inhibition. This suggests that 
keeping a neural network in a stable and functional state requires the 
coordination of distinct homeostatic mechanisms that operate not only by 
adjusting neural excitability, but also by controlling network connectivity.},

neurons evoke unitary postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) whose peak amplitudes 
either increase (facilitate) or decrease (depress) progressively. To examine the 
basis for these different synaptic responses, we made simultaneous recordings 
from three classes of neurons in cortical layer 2/3. We induced repetitive 
action potentials in pyramidal cells and recorded the evoked unitary excitatory 
(E)PSPs in two classes of GABAergic neurons. We observed facilitation of EPSPs 
in bitufted GABAergic interneurons, many of which expressed somatostatin 
immunoreactivity. EPSPs recorded from multipolar interneurons, however, showed 
depression. Some of these neurons were immunopositive for parvalbumin. Unitary 
inhibitory (I)PSPs evoked by repetitive stimulation of a bitufted neuron also 
showed a less pronounced but significant difference between the two target 
neurons. Facilitation and depression involve presynaptic mechanisms, and because 
a single neuron can express both behaviors simultaneously, we infer that local 
differences in the molecular structure of presynaptic nerve terminals are 
induced by retrograde signals from different classes of target neurons. Because 
bitufted and multipolar neurons both formed reciprocal inhibitory connections 
with pyramidal cells, the results imply that the balance of activation between 
two recurrent inhibitory pathways in the neocortex depends on the frequency of 
action potentials in pyramidal cells.}, Bdsk-url-1               =

established that attention modulates visual processing in extrastriate cortex. 
However, the underlying neural mechanisms are unknown. A consistent observation 
is that attention has its greatest impact on neuronal responses when multiple 
stimuli appear together within a cell's receptive field. One way to explain this 
is to assume that multiple stimuli activate competing populations of neurons and 
that attention biases this competition in favor of the attended stimulus. In the 
absence of competing stimuli, there is no competition to be resolved. 
Accordingly, attention has a more limited effect on the neuronal response to a 
single stimulus. To test this interpretation, we measured the responses of 
neurons in macaque areas V2 and V4 using a behavioral paradigm that allowed us 
to isolate automatic sensory processing mechanisms from attentional effects. 
First, we measured each cell's response to a single stimulus presented alone 
inside the receptive field or paired with a second receptive field stimulus, 
while the monkey attended to a location outside the receptive field. Adding the 
second stimulus typically caused the neuron's response to move toward the 
response that was elicited by the second stimulus alone. Then, we directed the 
monkey's attention to one element of the pair. This drove the neuron's response 
toward the response elicited when the attended stimulus appeared alone. These 
findings are consistent with the idea that attention biases competitive 
interactions among neurons, causing them to respond primarily to the attended 
stimulus. A quantitative neural model of attention is proposed to account for 
these results.}, keywords  = {Animals; Attention; Behavior, Animal; Electrodes,

  Abstract                 = {1. The integration of synaptic inputs to the 
apical dendrite of layer 5 neocortical pyramidal cells was studied using 
compartment model simulations. The goal was to characterize the generation of 
regenerative responses to synaptic inputs under two conditions: (a) where there 
was an absence of background synaptic input, and (b) when the entire cell 
surface was subjected to a uniform blanket of synaptic background conductance 
such that somatic input resistance was reduced 5-fold. 2. Dendritic morphology 
corresponded to a layer 5 thick-trunked pyramidal cell from rat primary visual 
cortex at postnatal day 28 (P28), with distribution of dendritic active currents 
guided by the electrophysiological characteristics of the apical trunk reported 
in this cell type. Response characteristics for two dendritic channel 
distributions were compared, one of which supported Ca(2+) spikes in the apical 
dendrite. 3. In the absence of background, synaptic input to the apical tuft was 
surprisingly effective in eliciting somatic firing when compared with input to 
apical oblique branches. This result obtained even when the tuft membrane was 
the least excitable in the dendritic tree. 4. The special efficacy of tuft input 
arose because its electrotonic characteristics favour development of a sustained 
depolarization which charged the apex of the apical trunk to its firing 
threshold; once initiated in the distal trunk, firing propagated inward to the 
soma. This mechanism did not depend upon the presence of depolarizing channels 
in tuft membrane, but did require an excitable apical trunk. 5. Rather than 
disconnect the tuft, background synaptic conductance enhanced the efficacy 
advantage enjoyed by input arriving there. This counterintuitive result arose 
because background reduced the subthreshold spread of voltage, and so diminished 
the ability of the excitation of various individual oblique branches to combine 
to charge the relatively thick adjacent trunk. In contrast, drive from the 
depolarized tuft is exerted at a single critical point, the apex of the distal 
trunk, and so was relatively undiminished by the background. Further, once 
initiation at the apex occurred, background had little effect on inward 
propagation along the trunk. 6. We conclude that synaptic input to the apical 
tuft of layer 5 cells may be unexpectedly effective in triggering cell firing in 
vivo. The advantage in efficacy was not dependent upon the characteristics of 
tuft membrane excitability, but rather stemmed from the geometry of the tuft and 
its junction with the distal apical trunk. The efficacy of tuft input was, 
however, critically dependent upon inward propagation, suggesting that 
modulation of membrane currents which affect propagation in the apical trunk 
might sensitively control the efficacy of tuft input.}, Institution

Synapses are modifiable, they modify with learning, and they strengthen through 
an LTP-like mechanism. We previously established the ability for synaptic 
modification and a synaptic strengthening with motor skill learning in 
horizontal connections of the rat motor cortex (MI). Here we investigated 
whether learning strengthened these connections through LTP. We demonstrated 
that synapses in the trained MI were near the ceiling of their modification 
range, compared with the untrained MI, but the range of synaptic modification 
was not affected by learning. In the trained MI, LTP was markedly reduced and 
LTD was enhanced. These results are consistent with the use of LTP to strengthen

{Activity-dependent synaptic plasticity is likely to provide a mechanism for 
learning and memory. Cortical synaptic responses that are strengthened within a 
fixed synaptic modification range after 5 days of motor skill learning are 
driven near the top of their range, leaving only limited room for additional 
synaptic strengthening. If synaptic strengthening is a requisite step for 
acquiring new skills, near saturation of long-term potentiation (LTP) should 
impede further learning or the LTP mechanism should recover after single-task 
learning. Here we show that the initial learning-induced synaptic enhancement is 
sustained even long after training has been discontinued and that the synaptic 
modification range shifts upward. This range shift places increased baseline 
synaptic efficacy back within the middle of its operating range, allowing 
prelearning levels of LTP and long-term depression. Persistent synaptic 
strengthening might be a substrate for long-term retention in motor cortex, 
whereas the shift in synaptic modification range ensures the availability for 
new synaptic strengthening.}, bdsk-url-1  =

the parallels between the psychological model of 'central coherence' in 
information processing [Frith, U., 1989. Autism: Explaining the Enigma. 
Blackwell, Oxford] and the neuroscience model of neural integration or 'temporal 
binding'. We proposed that autism is associated with abnormalities of 
information integration that is caused by a reduction in the connectivity 
between specialised local neural networks in the brain and possible 
overconnectivity within the isolated individual neural assemblies. The current 
paper updates this model, providing a summary of theoretical and empirical 
advances in research implicating disordered connectivity in autism. This is in 
the context of changes in the approach to the core psychological deficits in 
autism, of greater emphasis on 'interactive specialisation' and the resultant 
stress on early and/or low-level deficits and their cascading effects on the 
developing brain [Johnson, M.H., Halit, H., Grice, S.J., Karmiloff-Smith, A., 
2002. Neuroimaging of typical and atypical development: a perspective from 
multiple levels of analysis. Development and Psychopathology 14, 521-536]. We 
also highlight recent developments in the measurement and modelling of 
connectivity, particularly in the emerging ability to track the temporal 
dynamics of the brain using electroencephalography (EEG) and 
magnetoencephalography (MEG) and to investigate the signal characteristics of 
this activity. This advance could be particularly pertinent in testing an 
emerging model of effective connectivity based on the balance between excitatory 
and inhibitory cortical activity [Rubenstein, J.L., Merzenich M.M., 2003. Model 
of autism: increased ratio of excitation/inhibition in key neural systems.

selectivity and the sparseness of firing to visual stimuli of single neurons in 
the primate temporal cortical visual area, neuronal responses were measured to a 
set of 68 visual stimuli in macaques performing a visual fixation task. The 
population of neurons analyzed had responses that occurred primarily to faces. 
The stimuli included 23 faces, and 45 nonface images of real-world scenes, so 
that the function of this brain region could be analyzed when it was processing 
natural scenes. 2. The neurons were selected to meet the previously used 
criteria of face selectivity by responding more than twice as much to the 
optimal face as to the optimal nonface stimulus in the set. Application of 
information theoretic analyses to the responses of these neurons confirmed that 
their responses contained much more information about which of 20 face stimuli 
had been seen (on average 0.4 bits) than about which (of 20) nonface stimuli had 
been seen (on average 0.07 bits). 3. The sparseness of the representation of a 
scene or object provided by each of these neurons (which can be thought of as 
the proportion of stimuli to which the neuron responds, and which is fundamental 
to understanding the network operation of the system) can be defined as 
[formula: see text] where ri is the firing rate to the ith stimulus in the set 
of n stimuli. The sparseness has a maximal value of 1.0. It was found that the 
sparseness of the representation of the 68 stimuli by each neuron had an average 
across all neurons of 0.65. This indicates a rather distributed representation. 
4. If the spontaneous firing rate was subtracted from the firing rate of the 
neuron to each stimulus, so that the changes of firing rate, i.e., the responses 
of the neurons, were used in the sparseness calculation, then the "response 
sparseness" had a lower value, with a mean of 0.33 for the population of 
neurons, or 0.60 if calculated over the set of faces. 5. Multidimensional 
scaling to produce a stimulus space represented by this population of neurons 
showed that the different faces were well separated in the space created, 
whereas the different nonface stimuli were grouped together in the space. 6. The 
information analyses and multidimensional scaling provided evidence that what 
was made explicit in the responses of these neurons was information about which 
face had been seen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)}, keywords  = {Animals;

arises of how the visual system operates in a cluttered environment. To 
investigate this we measured the responses of neurons with face-selective 
responses in the cortex in the anterior part of the superior temporal sulcus of 
rhesus macaques performing a visual fixation task. We found that the response of 
neurons to an effective face centred 8.5 degrees from the fovea was decreased to 
71\% if an ineffective face stimulus for that cell was present at the fovea. In 
a similar way, introduction of a parafoveal ineffective face stimulus decreased 
the responses of these neurons to an effective face stimulus at the fovea to 
75\%. In addition to these interactions, it was found that an effective stimulus 
object at the fovea produced a larger response than when it was parafoveal, and 
that this weighting towards an object at the fovea was also seen when more than 
one object was present in the visual field. The implication of this weighting of 
the responses of neurons towards objects at the fovea, even in an environment 
with more than one object present, is that the output of the visual system 
provides information to subsequent systems particularly about objects at the 
fovea, so that learning about these objects (and less about other objects 
elsewhere in the visual field) is facilitated.}, keywords  = {Animals;

  Abstract                 = {Nearly all neuronal information processing and 
interneuronal communication in the brain involves action potentials, or spikes, 
which drive the short-term synaptic dynamics of neurons, but also their 
long-term dynamics, via synaptic plasticity. In many brain structures, action 
potential activity is considered to be sparse. This sparseness of activity has 
been exploited to reduce the computational cost of large-scale network 
simulations, through the development of event-driven simulation schemes. 
However, existing event-driven simulations schemes use extremely simplified 
neuronal models. Here, we implement and evaluate critically an event-driven 
algorithm (ED-LUT) that uses precalculated look-up tables to characterize 
synaptic and neuronal dynamics. This approach enables the use of more complex 
(and realistic) neuronal models or data in representing the neurons, while 
retaining the advantage of high-speed simulation. We demonstrate the method's 
application for neurons containing exponential synaptic conductances, thereby 
implementing shunting inhibition, a phenomenon that is critical to cellular 
computation. We also introduce an improved two-stage event-queue algorithm, 
which allows the simulations to scale efficiently to highly connected networks 
with arbitrary propagation delays. Finally, the scheme readily accommodates 
implementation of synaptic plasticity mechanisms that depend on spike timing, 
enabling future simulations to explore issues of long-term learning and 
adaptation in large-scale networks.}, Bdsk-url-1               =

{Cutting frozen sections of large (greater than 60 cc) blocks of monkey brain 
using the conventional procedures of infiltration with 30\% sucrose as a 
cryoprotectant before freezing with pulverized dry ice often produces 
unacceptable levels of freezing artifact (FA) caused by displacement of tissue 
by ice crystals. Experiments investigating FA utilized perfusion-fixed brains 
from 46 monkeys and spanned combinations of cryoprotectants (glycerol, sucrose), 
freezing methods (dry ice or -75 degrees C isopentane), and fixatives (10\% 
formalin, Karnovsky's or Timm's). The effects were evaluated by rating of FA 
severity in frozen sections of whole monkey brains. Minor FA appears as enlarged 
capillaries, more serious FA as large vacuoles, and both first appear midway 
between the periphery and center of the block. Stronger fixatives increased the 
severity of freezing artifact. The best method for eliminating FA was graded 
infiltration with up to 20\% glycerol and 2\% DMSO (in buffer or fixative), 
followed by rapid freezing in -75 degrees C isopentane. Although using a 
glycerol-DMSO infiltration before conventional freezing with pulverized dry ice 
or using conventional sucrose infiltration before freezing in isopentane gave 
better results than sucrose infiltration and dry-ice freezing, only the 
combination of glycerol-DMSO infiltration and freezing in isopentane produced 
consistently excellent results and virtually eliminated freezing artifact. To 
determine the effect of freezing with dry ice or isopentane on the rate of 
cooling in large blocks of CNS tissue, thermocouples were embedded in an 80-cc 
block of albumin-gelatin and frozen with the two methods. The rate of cooling 
(-3.5 degrees C/min) was twice as fast using isopentane.}, keywords  = {Animals;

  Abstract                 = {Neurons in the visual cortex receive a large 
amount of input from recurrent connections, yet the functional role of these 
connections remains unclear. Here we explore networks with strong recurrence in 
a computational model and show that short-term depression of the synapses in the 
recurrent loops implements an adaptive filter. This allows the visual system to 
respond reliably to deteriorated stimuli yet quickly to high-quality stimuli. 
For low-contrast stimuli, the model predicts long response latencies, whereas 
latencies are short for high-contrast stimuli. This is consistent with 
physiological data showing that in higher visual areas, latencies can increase 
more than 100 ms at low contrast compared to high contrast. Moreover, when 
presented with briefly flashed stimuli, the model predicts stereotypical 
responses that outlast the stimulus, again consistent with physiological 
findings. The adaptive properties of the model suggest that the abundant 
recurrent connections found in visual cortex serve to adapt the network's time 
constant in accordance with the stimulus and normalizes neuronal signals such 
that processing is as fast as possible while maintaining reliability.},

  Abstract                 = {An efficient new method for the exact digital 
simulation of time-invariant linear systems is presented. Such systems are 
frequently encountered as models for neuronal systems, or as submodules of such 
systems. The matrix exponential is used to construct a matrix iteration, which 
propagates the dynamic state of the system step by step on a regular time grid. 
A large and general class of dynamic inputs to the system, including trains of 
delta-pulses, can be incorporated into the exact simulation scheme. An extension 
of the proposed scheme presents an attractive alternative for the approximate 
simulation of networks of integrate-and-fire neurons with linear sub-threshold 
integration and non-linear spike generation. The performance of the proposed 
method is analyzed in comparison with a number of multi-purpose solvers. In 
simulations of integrate-and-fire neurons, Exact Integration systematically 
generates the smallest error with respect to both sub-threshold dynamics and 
spike timing. For the simulation of systems where precise spike timing is 
important, this results in a practical advantage in particular at moderate 
integration step sizes.}, Institution              = {Neurobiologie und

  abstract      = {Statistical models for describing 
the probability distribution over the states of biological systems are commonly 
used for dimensional reduction. Among these models, pairwise models are very 
attractive in part because they can be fit using a reasonable amount of data: 
knowledge of the means and correlations between pairs of elements in the system 
is sufficient. Not surprisingly, then, using pairwise models for studying neural 
data has been the focus of many studies in recent years. In this paper, we 
describe how tools from statistical physics can be employed for studying and 
using pairwise models. We build on our previous work on the subject and study 
the relation between different methods for fitting these models and evaluating 
their quality. In particular, using data from simulated cortical networks we 
study how the quality of various approximate methods for inferring the 
parameters in a pairwise model depends on the time bin chosen for binning the 
data. We also study the effect of the size of the time bin on the model quality 
itself, again using simulated data. We show that using finer time bins increases 
the quality of the pairwise model. We offer new ways of deriving the expressions 
reported in our previous work for assessing the quality of pairwise models.},

   = {Autism is a severe neurobehavioral syndrome, arising largely as an 
inherited disorder, which can arise from several diseases. Despite recent 
advances in identifying some genes that can cause autism, its underlying 
neurological mechanisms are uncertain. Autism is best conceptualized by 
considering the neural systems that may be defective in autistic individuals. 
Recent advances in understanding neural systems that process sensory 
information, various types of memories and social and emotional behaviors are 
reviewed and compared with known abnormalities in autism. Then, specific genetic 
abnormalities that are linked with autism are examined. Synthesis of this 
information leads to a model that postulates that some forms of autism are 
caused by an increased ratio of excitation/inhibition in sensory, mnemonic, 
social and emotional systems. The model further postulates that the increased 
ratio of excitation/inhibition can be caused by combinatorial effects of genetic 
and environmental variables that impinge upon a given neural system. 
Furthermore, the model suggests potential therapeutic interventions.},

abstract   = {Calcium has been proposed as a postsynaptic signal underlying 
synaptic spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). We examine this hypothesis 
with computational modeling based on experimental results from hippocampal 
cultures, some of which are presented here, in which pairs and triplets of pre- 
and postsynaptic spikes induce potentiation and depression in a temporally 
asymmetric way. Specifically, we present a set of model biochemical detectors, 
based on plausible molecular pathways, which make direct use of the time course 
of the calcium signal to reproduce these experimental STDP results. Our model 
features a modular structure, in which long-term potentiation (LTP) and 
depression (LTD) components compete to determine final plasticity outcomes; one 
aspect of this competition is a veto through which appropriate calcium time 
courses suppress LTD. Simulations of our model are also shown to be consistent 
with classical LTP and LTD induced by several presynaptic stimulation paradigms. 
Overall, our results provide computational evidence that, while the postsynaptic 
calcium time course contains sufficient information to distinguish various 
experimental long-term plasticity paradigms, small changes in the properties of 
back-propagation of action potentials or in synaptic dynamics can alter the 
calcium time course in ways that will significantly affect STDP induction by any 
detector based exclusively on postsynaptic calcium. This may account for the 
variability of STDP outcomes seen within hippocampal cultures, under repeated 
application of a single experimental protocol, as well as for that seen in 
multiple spike experiments across different systems.}, bdsk-url-1 =

  Abstract                 = {Event-driven simulation strategies were proposed 
recently to simulate integrate-and-fire (IF) type neuronal models. These 
strategies can lead to computationally efficient algorithms for simulating 
large-scale networks of neurons; most important, such approaches are more 
precise than traditional clock-driven numerical integration approaches because 
the timing of spikes is treated exactly. The drawback of such event-driven 
methods is that in order to be efficient, the membrane equations must be 
solvable analytically, or at least provide simple analytic approximations for 
the state variables describing the system. This requirement prevents, in 
general, the use of conductance-based synaptic interactions within the framework 
of event-driven simulations and, thus, the investigation of network paradigms 
where synaptic conductances are important. We propose here a number of 
extensions of the classical leaky IF neuron model involving approximations of 
the membrane equation with conductance-based synaptic current, which lead to 
simple analytic expressions for the membrane state, and therefore can be used in 
the event-driven framework. These conductance-based IF (gIF) models are compared 
to commonly used models, such as the leaky IF model or biophysical models in 
which conductances are explicitly integrated. All models are compared with 
respect to various spiking response properties in the presence of synaptic 
activity, such as the spontaneous discharge statistics, the temporal precision 
in resolving synaptic inputs, and gain modulation under in vivo-like synaptic 
bombardment. Being based on the passive membrane equation with fixed-threshold 
spike generation, the proposed gIF models are situated in between leaky IF and 
biophysical models but are much closer to the latter with respect to their 
dynamic behavior and response characteristics, while still being nearly as 
computationally efficient as simple IF neuron models. gIF models should 
therefore provide a useful tool for efficient and precise simulation of 
large-scale neuronal networks with realistic, conductance-based synaptic 
interactions.}, Bdsk-url-1               =

We show that theta-burst stimulation (TBS) and pairing of low-frequency 
presynaptic stimulation with depolarization of postsynaptic CA1 pyramidal cells 
induced similar levels of LTP in L1-deficient and wild-type mice. The basal 
excitatory synaptic transmission and density of asymmetric excitatory synapses 
in the stratum radiatum were also normal in L1-deficient mice. Since L1 is 
expressed not only by principal cells but also by inhibitory interneurons, we 
recorded inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) evoked in CA1 pyramidal cells 
by minimal stimulation of perisomatic interneurons. L1-deficient mice showed a 
reduction in the mean amplitude of putative unitary IPSCs, higher values of the 
coefficient of amplitude variation, higher number of failures in transmitter 
release, and a reduction in frequency but not amplitude of miniature IPSCs. The 
use-dependent modulation of inhibitory transmission by paired-pulse or short 
tetanic stimulation was, however, normal in L1-deficient mice. The physiological 
abnormalities correlated with a strong reduction in the density of inhibitory 
active zones, indicating that L1 is involved in establishing inhibitory

it is fatally conflated with another facet of perceptual problems that also

of LTP can mark a specifically activated synapse by a synaptic tag to capture 
synapse non-specific plasticity-related proteins (PRPs) and thus maintaining 
input-specific LTP for prolonged periods. Here we show in rat hippocampal slices 
in vitro, that the induction of protein synthesis-dependent late-LTD is also 
characterized by synaptic tagging and that heterosynaptic induction of either 
LTD or LTP on two sets of independent synaptic inputs S1 and S2 can lead to 
late-associative interactions: early-LTD in S2 was transformed into a late-LTD, 
if late-LTP was induced in S1. The synthesis of process-independent PRPs by 
late-LTP in S1 was sufficient to transform early- into late-LTD in S2 when 
process-specific synaptic tags were set. We name this new associative property 
of cellular information processing 'cross-tagging.'}, bdsk-url-1  =

hippocampal long-term potentiation (late LTP) and long-term depression (late

support the hypothesis that neurons store relevant information in dendritic 
functional compartments during late LTP and late LTD rather than in single 
synapses. It has been suggested that processes of "synaptic tagging" are 
restricted to such functional compartments. Here, we show that in addition to 
apical CA1 dendrites, synaptic tagging also takes place within basal CA1 
dendritic compartments after LTP induction. We present data that tagging in the 
basal dendrites is restricted to these compartments. Plasticity-related 
proteins, partially nonspecific to the locally induced process, are synthesized 
in dendritic compartments and then captured by local, process-specific synaptic 
tags. We support these findings in two ways: (1) late LTP/LTD, locally induced 
in apical or basal (late LTP) dendrites of hippocampal CA1 neurons, does not 
spread to the basal or apical compartment, respectively; (2) the specificity of 
the synaptic plasticity event is achieved by the activation of process- and 
compartment-specific synaptic tag molecules. We have identified 
calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II as the first LTP-specific and 
extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 as LTD-specific tag molecules in 
apical dendritic CA1 compartments, whereas either protein kinase A or protein 
kinase Mzeta mediates LTP-specific tags in basal dendrites.}, bdsk-url-1  =

persistently active protein kinase C isoform that is synthesized during 
long-term potentiation (LTP) and is critical for maintaining LTP. According to 
"synaptic tagging," newly synthesized, functionally important plasticity-related 
proteins (PRPs) may prolong potentiation not only at strongly tetanized 
pathways, but also at independent, weakly tetanized pathways if synaptic tags 
are set. We therefore investigated whether PKMzeta is involved in tagging and 
contributes to a sustained potentiation by providing strong and weak 
tetanization to two independent pathways and then disrupting the function of the 
kinase by a selective myristoylated zeta-pseudosubstrate inhibitory peptide. We 
found that persistent PKMzeta activity maintains potentiated responses, not only 
of the strongly tetanized pathway, but also of the weakly tetanized pathway. In 
contrast, an independent, nontetanized pathway was unaffected by the inhibitor, 
indicating that the function of PKMzeta was specific to the tagged synapses. To 
further delineate the specificity of the function of PKMzeta in synaptic 
tagging, we examined synaptic "cross-tagging," in which late LTP in one input 
can transform early into late long-term depression (LTD) in a separate input or, 
alternatively, late LTD in one input can transform early into late LTP in a 
second input, provided that the tags of the weak inputs are set. Although the 
PKMzeta inhibitor reversed late LTP, it did not prevent the persistent 
depression at the weakly stimulated, cross-tagged LTD input. Conversely, 
although the agent did not reverse late LTD, it blocked the persistent 
potentiation of weakly tetanized, cross-tagged synapses. Thus, PKMzeta is the 
first LTP-specific PRP and is critical for the transformation of early into late 
LTP during both synaptic tagging and cross-tagging.}, bdsk-url-1  =

clearly seen with Nomarski differential interference contrast optics in the 
light microscope. Tissue covering the identified cell is then removed 
mechanically and standard patch clamp techniques are applied. Using these 
methods, spontaneously occurring and stimulus-evoked inhibitory postsynaptic 
currents (IPSCs) were recorded from neurons in rat hippocampus at greatly 
improved resolution. In the presence of tetrodotoxin, to block presynaptic 
action potentials, spontaneous IPSCs seldom exceeded 25 pA. Evoked IPSCs 
elicited by constant electrical stimulation of a presynaptic neurone were larger 
and fluctuated in their amplitudes. Single-channel currents, activated by the 
putative inhibitory transmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), had a size of 
about 1 pA. The number of postsynaptic channels activated by a packet of 
inhibitory transmitter is probably not more than thirty, nearly two orders of 
magnitude smaller than previously reported estimates for CNS synapses. This 
might reflect matching of synaptic efficacy to the high input resistance of 
hippocampal neurones and could be a requirement for fine tuning of inhibition.},

spikes generated by a neuron in response to stimuli provide information about 
the nature of the stimuli and also about the functional organization of the 
circuit in which the neuron is embedded. Spike-triggered analysis techniques 
such as spike-triggered covariance (STC) have been proposed to characterize the 
receptive field properties of neurons. So far, they have been able to provide 
only limited information about the functional organization of neural circuitry; 
in particular, STC tends to generate subfields that are mixed observations of 
independent processes. We address this problem by adding a criterion that 
sources are independent, resulting in an approach we call spike-triggered 
independent component analysis (ST-ICA). The method exploits the central limit 
theorem to find the directions in the high-dimensional stimulus space of 
spike-triggered data that are most independent. We demonstrate the improvement 
of the ST-ICA method over STC analysis using simulated neurons. When tested on 
data obtained from the H1 neuron in the fly visual system, it predicts a spatial 
arrangement of functional subunits with adjacent receptive fields. The 
properties of these subunits strongly resemble the known properties of 
elementary movement detector inputs to the H1 neuron. Using the ST-ICA method, 
we derive a model that captures functional and physiological properties of fly 
motion vision.},

efficacy is modulated in a graded or binary manner. It has been argued that 
binary synaptic weights would be less susceptible to noise than graded weights, 
which has impelled some theoretical neuroscientists to shift from the use of 
graded to binary weights in their models. We compare retrieval performance of 
models using both binary and graded weight representations through numerical 
simulations of stochastic attractor networks. We also investigate stochastic 
attractor models using multiple discrete levels of weight states, and then 
investigate the optimal threshold for dilution of binary weight representations. 
Our results show that a binary weight representation is not less susceptible to 
noise than a graded weight representation in stochastic attractor models, and we 
find that the load capacities with an increasing number of weight states rapidly 
reach the load capacity with graded weights. The optimal threshold for dilution 
of binary weight representations under stochastic conditions occurs when 
approximately 50\% of the smallest weights are set to zero.}, bdsk-url-1  =

inputs innervating cortical pyramidal neurons. At present little is known about 
signal processing in these fine dendrites. Here we show that coactivation of 
clustered neighbouring basal inputs initiated local dendritic spikes, which 
resulted in a 5.9 +/- 1.5 mV (peak) and 64.4 +/- 19.8 ms (half-width) 
cable-filtered voltage change at the soma that amplified the somatic voltage 
response by 226 +/- 46\%. These spikes were accompanied by large calcium 
transients restricted to the activated dendritic segment. In contrast to 
conventional sodium or calcium spikes, these spikes were mediated mostly by NMDA 
(N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor channels, which contributed at least 80\% of the 
total charge. The ionic mechanism of these NMDA spikes may allow 'dynamic 
spike-initiation zones', set by the spatial distribution of glutamate pre-bound 
to NMDA receptors, which in turn would depend on recent and ongoing activity in 
the cortical network. In addition, NMDA spikes may serve as a powerful mechanism 
for modification of the cortical network by inducing long-term strengthening of 
co-activated neighbouring inputs.}, Bdsk-url-1               =

applied to thin slices of the rat pituitary gland in order to study synaptic 
transmission between hypothalamic nerve terminals and neuroendocrine cells of 
the intermediate lobe. Inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) could be evoked 
by electrical stimulation of afferent neuronal fibres in the surrounding tissue 
of the slice. The IPSCs could be evoked in an all-or-nothing mode depending on 
the stimulus intensity, suggesting that single afferent fibres were stimulated. 
They had a chloride-dependent reversal potential and were blocked by bicuculline 
(Kd = 0.1 microM), indicating that they were mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid 
A (GABAA) receptors. In symmetrical chloride solutions the current/voltage 
relation of the IPSC peak amplitudes was linear. The IPSCs were characterized by 
a fast (1-2 ms) rise time and a biexponential decay, with time constants of 21 
+/- 4 ms and 58 +/- 14 ms at a holding potential of -60 mV (n = 6 cells). Both 
decay time constants increased with depolarization in an exponential manner. 
Spontaneously occurring IPSCs had a time course that was similar to that of 
evoked IPSCs. These miniature IPSCs, recorded in 1 microM tetrodotoxin, 
displayed an amplitude distribution that was well fitted by single Gaussian 
functions, with a mean value of its maxima of 18.1 +/- 2.3 pA (n = 4 cells). 
Amplitude histograms of evoked IPSCs were characterized by multiple peaks with a 
modal amplitude of about 18 pA (n = 6 cells). These findings indicate the 
quantal nature of GABAergic synaptic transmission in this system, with a quantal 
conductance step of about 280 pS. Single-channel currents underlying the IPSCs 
were studied by bath application of GABA to outside-out patches excised from 
intermediate lobe cells. Such GABA-induced currents revealed two conductance 
levels of 14 pS and 26 pS. In conclusion, GABAergic synaptic transmission in 
neuroendocrine cells of the pituitary has properties that are quite similar to 
those observed in neurones of the central nervous system.}, institution =

  abstract    = {1. A thin-slice preparation was used to study the 
postsynaptic potentials and the underlying currents of visually identified rat 
medial septal (MS) neurones under tight-seal voltage- and current-clamp 
conditions. 2. Upon stimulation of the afferent fibres, all MS neurones 
exhibited a sequence of excitatory-inhibitory postsynaptic potentials 
(EPSP-IPSP). Under voltage clamp, with potassium glutamate as internal solution 
and at negative holding potentials (Vh), this synaptic pattern appeared as an 
initial inward current followed by a longer lasting outward current. 3. The 
inward postsynaptic current was completely abolished by 5 
microM-6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) whereas the outward current 
disappeared in the presence of 10 microM-bicuculline. Thus the major excitatory 
and inhibitory synaptic inputs were identified as being due to activation of 
quisqualate/kainate glutamatergic and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptors, 
respectively. 4. At positive Vh a CNQX-resistant component of the excitatory 
postsynaptic current (EPSC) was revealed. This component was slower than the one 
mediated by the quisqualate receptor and was abolished by 
3-3(2-carboxypiperazine-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonate (CPP), indicating that 
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are involved in excitatory synaptic 
transmission in MS cells. The existence of the two main subtypes (NMDA and 
non-NMDA) of glutamatergic receptors in MS neurones was also confirmed by the 
responses of the neurones to bath application of the different agonists 
(glutamate, quisqualate, kainate and NMDA). 5. The CNQX-sensitive EPSC had a 
reversal potential near 0 mV. The fast rise time (approximately 0.7 ms) 
indicates a somatic location of the excitatory synapses. The relaxation kinetics 
of the fast EPSC were fitted by a single exponential function with a time 
constant of 1.13 +/- 0.1 ms. This parameter was independent of Vh. Fast EPSCs 
were blocked by CNQX in a dose-dependent manner (dissociation constant, KD = 0.2 
microM). 6. Inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) were studied in symmetrical 
chloride solutions after blockade of the excitatory receptors. The 
current-voltage relation was linear and reversed at 0 mV. The IPSCs had a fast 
rise time and their decay was best fitted by the sum of two exponentials with 
time constant of approximately 20 and 50 ms (Vh = -60 mV). The IPSCs were 
abolished by bicuculline (KD = 1 microM), a selective antagonist of GABAA 
receptors. As expected, bath application of GABA produced large whole-cell 
currents. 7. In many cells, in addition to the usual EPSP-IPSP sequence, 
failures of either the EPSP or the IPSP were frequently observed during the 
experimental protocol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

{Synaptic plasticity requires remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. Although two 
actin isoforms, Î²- and Î³-actin, are expressed in dendritic spines, the 
specific contribution of Î³-actin in the expression of synaptic plasticity is 
unknown. We show that synaptic Î³-actin levels are regulated by the E3 ubiquitin 
ligase TRIM3. TRIM3 protein and Actg1 transcript are colocalized in messenger 
ribonucleoprotein granules responsible for the dendritic targeting of messenger 
RNAs. TRIM3 polyubiquitylates Î³-actin, most likely cotranslationally at 
synaptic sites. Trim3(-/-) mice consequently have increased levels of Î³-actin 
at hippocampal synapses, resulting in higher spine densities, increased 
long-term potentiation, and enhanced short-term contextual fear memory 
consolidation. Interestingly, hippocampal deletion of Actg1 caused an increase 
in long-term fear memory. Collectively, our findings suggest that temporal 
control of Î³-actin levels by TRIM3 is required to regulate the timing of 
hippocampal plasticity. We propose a model in which TRIM3 regulates synaptic 
Î³-actin turnover and actin filament stability and thus forms a transient 
inhibitory constraint on the expression of hippocampal synaptic plasticity.},

   = {The nervous system faces an extremely difficult task. It must be flexible, 
both during development and in adult life, so that it can respond to a variety 
of environmental demands and produce adaptive behavior. At the same time the 
nervous system must be stable, so that the neural circuits that produce behavior 
function throughout the lifetime of the animal and that changes produced by 
learning endure. We are only beginning to understand how neural networks strike 
a balance between altering individual neurons in the name of plasticity, while 
maintaining long-term stability in neural system function. The balance of this 
plasticity and stability in neural networks undoubtedly plays a critical role in 
the normal functioning of the nervous system. While mechanisms of synaptic 
plasticity have garnered extensive study over the past three decades, it is only 
recently that more attention has been turned to plasticity of intrinsic 
excitability as a key player in neural network function. This review will focus 
on this emerging area of research that undoubtedly will contribute a great deal

oriented high-contrast stimuli in the receptive field (RF) center are suppressed 
by stimuli in the RF surround, but can be facilitated when the RF center is 
stimulated at low contrast. The neural circuits and mechanisms for surround 
modulation are still unknown. We previously proposed that topdown feedback 
connections mediate suppression from the "far" surround, while "near' surround 
suppression is mediated primarily by horizontal connections. We implemented this 
idea in a recurrent network model of V1. A model assumption needed to account 
for the contrast-dependent sign of surround modulation is a response asymmetry 
between excitation and inhibition; accordingly, inhibition, but not excitation, 
is silent for weak visual inputs to the RF center, and surround stimulation can 
evoke facilitation. A prediction stemming from this same assumption is that 
surround suppression is weaker for low than for high contrast stimuli in the RF 
center. Previous studies are inconsistent with this prediction. Using single 
unit recordings in macaque V1, we confirm this model's prediction. Model 
simulations demonstrate that our results can be reconciled with those from 
previous studies. We also performed a systematic comparison of the 
experimentally measured surround suppression strength with predictions of the 
model operated in different parameter regimes. We find that the original model, 
with strong horizontal and no feedback excitation of local inhibitory neurons, 
can only partially account quantitatively for the experimentally measured 
suppression. Strong direct feedback excitation of V1 inhibitory neurons is 
necessary to account for the experimentally measured surround suppression 
strength.}, bdsk-url-1  = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.01.032},

of neurons in sensory cortices are affected by the spatial context within which 
stimuli are embedded. In the primary visual cortex (V1), orientation-selective 
responses to stimuli in the receptive field (RF) center are suppressed by 
similarly oriented stimuli in the RF surround. Surround suppression, a likely 
neural correlate of perceptual figure-ground segregation, is traditionally 
thought to be generated within V1 by long-range horizontal connections. Recently 
however, it has been shown that these connections are too short and too slow to 
mediate fast suppression from distant regions of the RF surround. We use an 
anatomically and physiologically constrained recurrent network model of macaque 
V1 to show how interareal feedback connections, which are faster and 
longer-range than horizontal connections, can generate "far" surround 
suppression. We provide a novel solution to the puzzle of how surround 
suppression can arise from excitatory feedback axons contacting predominantly 
excitatory neurons in V1. The basic mechanism involves divergent feedback 
connections from the far surround targeting pyramidal neurons sending 
monosynaptic horizontal connections to excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the 
RF center. One of several predictions of our model is that the "suppressive far 
surround" is not always suppressive, but can facilitate the response of the RF 
center, depending on the amount of excitatory drive to the local inhibitors. Our 
model provides a general mechanism of how top-down feedback signals directly 
contribute to generating cortical neuron responses to simple sensory stimuli.},

cholinergic receptors. Topical application of acetylcholine (ACh) onto 
hippocampal slices produces a characteristic complex response consisting of a 
depolarization, an increase in input resistance especially upon depolarization 
and a blockade of a slow afterhyperpolarization (AHP). The first two of these 
responses can be recorded also in non-cholinergic septal neurons in an area 
which contains about 8\% of the M1 muscarinic receptors found in the 
hippocampus. The responses of hippocampal but not septal neurons to ACh involve 
an increase in the spontaneous synaptic activity and a decrease in evoked 
responses to afferent stimulation. The dissociated hippocampal culture was used 
to study these presynaptic effects. The neurons in culture possess muscarinic 
receptors which develop gradually over a period of several weeks after plating. 
ACh rarely depolarizes hippocampal neurons in culture. Instead, it causes an 
increase in spontaneous discharge of small postsynaptic currents (PSC's) and a 
marked decrease of large, evoked PSC's. In some cultured hippocampal cells ACh 
reduced ICa without affecting any of several outward K currents studied. It is 
suggested that ACh reduces evoked activity by reducing Ca currents at 
presynaptic terminals.}, institution = {Center for Neurosciences, Weizmann

using orientation selectivity as an example. We compare two principal classes of 
model: one in which the tuning curves are sharpened through cortical lateral 
interactions, and one in which they are not. We report that sharpening through 
lateral interactions does not improve population codes but, on the contrary, 
leads to a severe loss of information. In addition, the sharpening models 
generate complicated codes that rely extensively on pairwise correlations. Our

Recent theoretical studies have shown that the information capacity of such a 
coding scheme is very limited in the presence of the experimentally observed 
pairwise correlations. However, central to the analysis of these studies was the 
assumption of a homogeneous population of neurons. Experimental findings show a 
considerable measure of heterogeneity in the response properties of different 
neurons. In this study, we investigate the effect of neuronal heterogeneity on 
the information capacity of a correlated population of neurons. We show that 
information capacity of a heterogeneous network is not limited by the correlated 
noise, but scales linearly with the number of cells in the population. This 
information cannot be extracted by the population vector readout, whose accuracy 
is greatly suppressed by the correlated noise. On the other hand, we show that 
an optimal linear readout that takes into account the neuronal heterogeneity can 
extract most of this information. We study analytically the nature of the 
dependence of the optimal linear readout weights on the neuronal diversity. We 
show that simple online learning can generate readout weights with the 
appropriate dependence on the neuronal diversity, thereby yielding efficient 
readout.}, bdsk-url-1  = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/neco.2006.18.8.1951}, doi

abstract    = {Theoretical and experimental studies of distributed neuronal 
representations of sensory and behavioral variables usually assume that the 
tuning of the mean firing rates is the main source of information. However, 
recent theoretical studies have investigated the effect of cross-correlations in 
the trial-to-trial fluctuations of the neuronal responses on the accuracy of the 
representation. Assuming that only the first-order statistics of the neuronal 
responses are tuned to the stimulus, these studies have shown that in the 
presence of correlations, similar to those observed experimentally in cortical 
ensembles of neurons, the amount of information in the population is limited, 
yielding nonzero error levels even in the limit of infinitely large populations 
of neurons. In this letter, we study correlated neuronal populations whose 
higher-order statistics, and in particular response variances, are also 
modulated by the stimulus. Weask two questions: Does the correlated noise limit 
the accuracy of the neuronal representation of the stimulus? and, How can a 
biological mechanism extract most of the information embedded in the 
higher-order statistics of the neuronal responses? Specifically, we address 
these questions in the context of a population of neurons coding an angular 
variable. We show that the information embedded in the variances grows linearly 
with the population size despite the presence of strong correlated noise. This 
information cannot be extracted by linear readout schemes, including the linear 
population vector. Instead, we propose a bilinear readout scheme that involves 
spatial decorrelation, quadratic nonlinearity, and population vector summation. 
We show that this nonlinear population vector scheme yields accurate estimates 
of stimulus parameters, with an efficiency that grows linearly with the 
population size. This code can be implemented using biologically plausible 
neurons.}, bdsk-url-1  = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/089976604773717559}, doi

  = {275--298}, abstract  = {1. Variation in stimulus contrast produces a marked 
effect on the dynamics of the cat retina. This contrast effect was investigated 
by measurement of the responses of X and Y ganglion cells. The stimuli were sine 
gratings or rectangular spots modulated by a temporal signal which was a sum of 
sinusoids. Fourier analysis of the neural response to such a stimulus allowed us 
to calculate first order and second order frequency kernels. 2. The first order 
frequency kernel of both X and Y ganglion cells became more sharply tuned at 
higher contrasts. The peak amplitude also shifted to higher temporal frequency 
at higher contrasts. Responses to low frequencies of modulation (less than 1 Hz) 
grew less than proportionally with contrast. However, response amplitudes at 
higher modulation frequencies (greater than 4 Hz) scaled approximately 
proportionally with contrast. Also, there was a marked phase advance in these 
latter components as contrast increased. 3. The contrast effect was 
significantly larger for Y cells than for X cells. 4. The first order frequency 
kernel was measured with single sine waves as well as with the sum of sinusoids 
as a modulation signal. The transfer function measured in this way was much less 
affected by increases in contrast. This implied that stimulus energy at one 
temporal frequency could affect the response amplitude and phase shift at 
another temporal frequency. 5. Direct proof was found that modulation at one 
frequency modifies the response at other frequencies. This was demonstrated by 
perturbation experiments in which the modulation stimulus was the sum of one 
strong perturbing sinusoid and seven weak test sinusoids. 6. The shape of the 
graph of the amplitude of the first order frequency kernel vs. temporal 
frequency did not depend on the amplitudes of the first order components, but 
rather on local retinal contrast. This was shown in an experiment with a sine 
grating placed at different positions in the visual field. The shape of the 
first order kernel did not vary with spatial phase, while the magnitudes of the 
first order responses varied greatly with spatial phase. 7. Models for the 
contrast gain control mechanism are considered in the Discussion.}, keywords  =

{97--129}, abstract    = {1. Single myelinated nerve fibres 12-17 mum in 
diameter from Rana temporaria and Rana pipiens were voltage clamped at 2-5 
degrees C. Potassium currents were blocked by internal Cs(+) and external 
tetraethylammonium ion. Series resistance compensation was employed.2. Sets of 
80-512 identical, 20 ms depolarizations were applied, with the pulses repeated 
at intervals of 300-600 ms. The resulting membrane current records, filtered at 
5 kHz, showed record-to-record variations of the current on the order of 1\%. 
From each set of records the time course of the mean current and the time course 
of the variance were calculated.3. The variance was assumed to arise primarily 
from two independent sources of current fluctuations: the stochastic gating of 
sodium channels and the thermal noise background in the voltage clamp. 
Measurement of the passive properties of the nerve preparation allowed the 
thermal noise variance to be estimated, and these estimates accounted for the 
variance observed in the presence of tetrodotoxin and at the reversal 
potential.4. After the variance sigma(2) was corrected for the contribution from 
the background, its relationship to the mean current I could be fitted by the 
function sigma(2) = iI-I(2)/N expected for N independent channels having one 
non-zero conductance level. The single channel currents i corresponded to a 
single-channel chord conductance gamma = 6.4 +/- 0.9 pS (S.D.; n = 14). No 
significant difference in gamma was observed between the two species of frogs. 
The size of the total population of channels ranged from 20,000 to 46,000.5. The 
voltage dependence of i corresponded closely to the form of the instantaneous 
current-voltage relationship of the sodium conductance, except at the smallest 
depolarizations. The small values of i at small depolarizations may have 
resulted from the filtering of high-frequency components of the fluctuations.6. 
It is concluded that sodium channels have only two primary levels of 
conductance, corresponding to ;open' and ;closed' states of the channel.7. The 
fraction p(max) of channels open at the time of the peak conductance was found 
to be 0.59 +/- 0.08 (S.D.; n = 5) and 0.9 +/- 0.1 (S.D.; n = 3) for 
depolarizations to -5 and +125 mV, respectively. (50 ms hyperpolarizations to 
-105 mV preceded the depolarizations in each case.) These values are similar to 
those predicted by Hodgkin-Huxley kinetics.8. Fluctuations in the firing 
threshold of neurones are expected from the stochastic gating of sodium 
channels. A prediction of the size of these fluctuations based on the measured 
properties of the channels gives a value of about 1\% for the relative spread, 
which agrees with experimental values in the literature.}, keywords    =

  Abstract                 = {The functions performed by different neural 
microcircuits depend on the anatomical and physiological properties of the 
various synaptic pathways connecting neurons. Neural microcircuits across 
various species and brain regions are similar in terms of their repertoire of 
neurotransmitters, their synaptic kinetics, their short-term and long-term 
plasticity, and the target-specificity of their synaptic connections. However, 
microcircuits can be fundamentally different in terms of the precise recurrent 
design used to achieve a specific functionality. In this review, which is part 
of the TINS Microcircuits Special Feature, we compare the connectivity designs 
in spinal, hippocampal, neocortical and cerebellar microcircuits, and discuss 
the different computational challenges that each microcircuit faces.},

  Abstract                 = {Most synaptic inputs are made onto the dendritic 
tree. Recent work has shown that dendrites play an active role in transforming 
synaptic input into neuronal output and in defining the relationships between 
active synapses. In this review, we discuss how these dendritic properties 
influence the rules governing the induction of synaptic plasticity. We argue 
that the location of synapses in the dendritic tree, and the type of dendritic 
excitability associated with each synapse, play decisive roles in determining 
the plastic properties of that synapse. Furthermore, since the electrical 
properties of the dendritic tree are not static, but can be altered by 
neuromodulators and by synaptic activity itself, we discuss how learning rules 
may be dynamically shaped by tuning dendritic function. We conclude by 
describing how this reciprocal relationship between plasticity of dendritic 
excitability and synaptic plasticity has changed our view of information 
processing and memory storage in neuronal networks.}, Bdsk-url-1               =

effects of contrast on human psychophysical orientation and spatial frequency 
discrimination thresholds and on the responses of individual neurons in the 
cat's striate cortex. Contrast has similar effects on orientation and spatial 
frequency discrimination: as contrast is increased above detection threshold, 
orientation and spatial frequency discrimination performance improves but 
reaches maximum levels at quite low contrasts. Further increases in contrast 
produce no further improvements in discrimination. We measured the effects of 
contrast on response amplitude, orientation and spatial frequency selectivity, 
and response variance of neurons in the cat's striate cortex. Orientation and 
spatial frequency selectivity vary little with contrast. Also, the ratio of 
response variance to response mean is unaffected by contrast. Although, in many 
cells, response amplitude increases approximately linearly with log contrast 
over most of the visible range, some cells show complete or partial saturation 
of response amplitude at medium contrasts. Therefore, some cells show a clear 
increase in slope of the orientation and spatial frequency tuning functions with 
increasing contrast, whereas in others the slopes reach maximum values at medium 
contrasts. Using receiver operating characteristic analysis, we estimated the 
minimum orientation and spatial frequency differences that can be signaled 
reliably as a response change by an individual cell. This analysis shows that, 
on average, the discrimination of orientation or spatial frequency improves with 
contrast at low contrasts more than at higher contrasts. Using the optimal 
stimulus for each cell, we estimated the contrast threshold of 48 neurons. Most 
cells had contrast thresholds below 5\%. Thresholds were only slightly higher 
for nonoptimal stimuli. Therefore, increasing the contrast of sinusoidal 
gratings above approximately 10\% will not produce large increases in the number 
of responding cells. The observed effects of contrast on the response 
characteristics of nonsaturating cortical cells do not appear consistent with 
the psychophysical results. Cells that reach their maximum response at 
low-to-medium contrasts may account for the contrast independence of 
psychophysical orientation and spatial frequency discrimination thresholds at 
medium and high contrasts.}, keywords  = {Animals; Cats; Differential Threshold;

is a difficult problem. Part of the difficulty is that with standard block-based 
signal analysis methods, the representation is sensitive to the arbitrary 
alignment of the blocks with respect to the signal. Convolutional techniques 
such as shift-invariant transformations can reduce this sensitivity, but these 
do not yield a code that is efficient, that is, one that forms a nonredundant 
representation of the underlying structure. Here, we develop a non-block-based 
method for signal representation that is both time relative and efficient. 
Signals are represented using a linear superposition of time-shiftable kernel 
functions, each with an associated magnitude and temporal position. Signal 
decomposition in this method is a non-linear process that consists of optimizing 
the kernel function scaling coefficients and temporal positions to form an 
efficient, shift-invariant representation. We demonstrate the properties of this 
representation for the purpose of characterizing structure in various types of 
nonstationary acoustic signals. The computational problem investigated here has 
direct relevance to the neural coding at the auditory nerve and the more general

strength of synapses during global changes in neural activity, thereby 
stabilizing the overall activity of neural networks. Suppression of synaptic 
activity increases synaptic strength by inducing synthesis of retinoic acid 
(RA), which activates postsynaptic synthesis of AMPA-type glutamate receptors 
(AMPARs) in dendrites and promotes synaptic insertion of newly synthesized 
AMPARs. Here, we show that fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an 
RNA-binding protein that regulates dendritic protein synthesis, is essential for 
increases in synaptic strength induced by RA or by blockade of neural activity 
in the mouse hippocampus. Although activity-dependent RA synthesis is maintained 
in Fmr1 knock-out neurons, RA-dependent dendritic translation of GluR1-type AMPA 
receptors is impaired. Intriguingly, FMRP is only required for the form of 
homeostatic plasticity that is dependent on both RA signaling and local protein 
synthesis. Postsynaptic expression of wild-type or mutant FMRP(I304N) in 
knock-out neurons reduced the total, surface, and synaptic levels of AMPARs, 
implying a role for FMRP in regulating AMPAR abundance. Expression of FMRP 
lacking the RGG box RNA-binding domain had no effect on AMPAR levels. 
Importantly, postsynaptic expression of wild-type FMRP, but not FMRP(I304N) or 
FMRP?RGG, restored synaptic scaling when expressed in knock-out neurons. 
Together, these findings identify an unanticipated role for FMRP in regulating 
homeostatic synaptic plasticity downstream of RA. Our results raise the 
possibility that at least some of the symptoms of fragile X syndrome reflect 
impaired homeostatic plasticity and impaired RA signaling.}, bdsk-url-1  =

the role of the primate medial frontal cortex in planning and controlling

they might encode signals related to the timing of reward or its temporally 
discounted value. In both cortical areas, signals related to the number of 
remaining movements and those related to movement direction were often combined 
multiplicatively, suggesting that the gain of the signals related to movements 
might be modulated by motivational factors. Finally, compared with the

of long-range intracortical inputs is known to be context-dependent: the same

explains contrast-dependent modulations within the classical receptive field,

abstract    = {The neuronal and synaptic organisation of the cerebral cortex 
appears exceedingly complex, and the definition of a basic cortical circuit in 
terms of defined classes of cells and connections is necessary to facilitate 
progress of its analysis. During the last two decades quantitative studies of 
the synaptic connectivity of identified cortical neurones and their molecular 
dissection revealed a number of general rules that apply to all areas of cortex. 
In this review, first the precise location of postsynaptic GABA and glutamate 
receptors is examined at cortical synapses, in order to define the site of 
synaptic interactions. It is argued that, due to the exclusion of G 
protein-coupled receptors from the postsynaptic density, the presence of 
extrasynaptic receptors and the molecular compartmentalisation of the 
postsynaptic membrane, the synapse should include membrane areas beyond the 
membrane specialisation. Subsequently, the following organisational principles 
are examined: 1. The cerebral cortex consists of: (i) a large population of 
principal neurones reciprocally connected to the thalamus and to each other via 
axon collaterals releasing excitatory amino acids, and, (ii) a smaller 
population of mainly local circuit GABAergic neurones. 2. Differential 
reciprocal connections are also formed amongst GABAergic neurones. 3. All 
extrinsic and intracortical glutamatergic pathways terminate on both the 
principal and the GABAergic neurones, differentially weighted according to the 
pathway. 4. Synapses of multiple sets of glutamatergic and GABAergic afferents 
subdivide the surface of cortical neurones and are often co-aligned on the 
dendritic domain. 5. A unique feature of the cortex is the GABAergic axo-axonic 
cell, influencing principal cells through GABAA receptors at synapses located 
exclusively on the axon initial segment. The analysis of these salient features 
of connectivity has revealed a remarkably selective array of connections, yet a 
highly adaptable design of the basic circuit emerges when comparisons are made 
between cortical areas or layers. The basic circuit is most obvious in the 
hippocampus where a relatively homogeneous set of spatially aligned principal 
cells allows an easy visualization of the organisational rules. Those principles 
which have been examined in the isocortex proved to be identical or very 
similar. In the isocortex, the basic circuit, scaled to specific requirements, 
is repeated in each layer. As multiple sets of output neurones evolved, 
requiring subtly different needs for their inputs, the basic circuit may be 
superimposed several times in the same layer. Tangential intralaminar 
connections in both the hippocampus and isocortex also connect output neurones 
with similar properties, as best seen in the patchy connections in the 
isocortex. The additional radial superposition of several laminae of distinct 
sets of output neurones, each representing and supported by its basic circuit, 
requires a co-ordination of their activity that is mediated by highly selective 
interlaminar connections, involving both the GABAergic and the excitatory amino 
acid releasing neurones. The remarkable specificity in the geometry of cells and 
the selectivity in placement of neurotransmitter receptors and synapses on their 
surface, strongly suggest a predominant role for time in the coding of 
information, but this does not exclude an important role also for the rate of 
action potential discharge in cortical representation of information.},

several nonrandom features in synaptic connectivity. We confirmed previous 
reports that bidirectional connections are more common than expected in a random 
network. We found that several highly clustered three-neuron connectivity 
patterns are overrepresented, suggesting that connections tend to cluster 
together. We also analyzed synaptic connection strength as defined by the peak 
excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitude. We found that the distribution of 
synaptic connection strength differs significantly from the Poisson distribution 
and can be fitted by a lognormal distribution. Such a distribution has a heavier 
tail and implies that synaptic weight is concentrated among few synaptic 
connections. In addition, the strengths of synaptic connections sharing pre- or 
postsynaptic neurons are correlated, implying that strong connections are even 
more clustered than the weak ones. Therefore, the local cortical network 
structure can be viewed as a skeleton of stronger connections in a sea of weaker 
ones. Such a skeleton is likely to play an important role in network dynamics 
and should be investigated further.}, bdsk-url-1 =

demonstrated by the improvement in most visual discrimination tasks after 
intensive practice. However, previous studies have demonstrated that practice 
improved the discrimination only around oblique orientations, while performance 
around cardinal orientations (vertical or horizontal orientations) remained 
stable despite extensive training. The two experiments described here used 
event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate the neural substrates underlying 
different training effects in the two kinds of orientation. Event-related 
potentials were recorded from subjects when they were trained with a grating 
orientation discrimination task. Psychophysical threshold measurements were 
performed before and after the training. For oblique gratings, psychophysical 
thresholds decreased significantly across training sessions. ERPs showed larger 
P2 and P3 amplitudes and smaller N1 amplitudes over the parietal/occipital areas 
with more practice. In line with the psychophysical thresholds, the training 
effect on the P2 and P3 were specific to stimulus orientation. However, the N1 
effect was generalized over differently oriented gratings stimuli. For 
cardinally oriented gratings, no significant changes were found in the 
psychophysical thresholds during the training. ERPs still showed similar 
generalized N1 effect as the oblique gratings. However, the amplitudes of P2 and 
P3 were unchanged during the whole training. Compared with cardinal 
orientations, more visual processing stages and later ERP components were 
involved in the training of oblique orientation discrimination. These results 
contribute to understanding the neural basis of the asymmetry between cardinal

to network rhythms. In vitro, pyramidal cells exhibit theta-band membrane 
potential (subthreshold) resonance, but whether and how subthreshold resonance 
translates into spiking resonance in freely behaving animals is unknown. Here, 
we used optogenetic activation to trigger spiking in pyramidal cells or 
parvalbumin immunoreactive interneurons (PV) in the hippocampus and neocortex of 
freely behaving rodents. Individual directly activated pyramidal cells exhibited 
narrow-band spiking centered on a wide range of frequencies. In contrast, PV 
photoactivation indirectly induced theta-band-limited, excess postinhibitory 
spiking in pyramidal cells (resonance). PV-inhibited pyramidal cells and 
interneurons spiked at PV-inhibition troughs, similar to CA1 cells during 
spontaneous theta oscillations. Pharmacological blockade of 
hyperpolarization-activated (I(h)) currents abolished theta resonance. 
Inhibition-induced theta-band spiking was replicated in a pyramidal 
cell-interneuron model that included I(h). Thus, PV interneurons mediate 
pyramidal cell spiking resonance in intact cortical networks, favoring 
transmission at theta frequency.}, Chemicals                = {Parvalbumins,

exact confidence limits of the parameters can be calculated. Least-squares 
methods are introduced which consider the measured error-covariance matrix of

methods, it is demonstrated that both the error predictions and the confidence

plasticity. Activity-dependent trafficking of PSD-95 is triggered by 
phosphorylation at serine 73, a conserved calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein 
kinase II (CaMKII) consensus phosphorylation site, which negatively regulates 
spine growth and potentiation of synaptic currents. We propose that PSD-95 and

Such exponential growth motivates us to ask how data analysis techniques are

neurons are analyzed independently on the basis of their tuning to stimuli or 
movement. Although tuning curve approaches are unaffected by growing numbers of 
simultaneously recorded neurons, newly developed techniques that analyze 
interactions between neurons become more accurate and more complex as the number 
of recorded neurons increases. Emerging data analysis techniques should consider 
both the computational costs and the potential for more accurate models 
associated with this exponential growth of the number of recorded neurons.},

  Abstract                 = {We recorded miniature endplate currents (mEPCs) 
using simultaneous voltage clamp and extracellular methods, allowing correction 
for time course measurement errors. We obtained a 20-80\% rise time (tr) of 
approximately 80 micros at 22 degrees C, shorter than any previously reported 
values, and tr variability (SD) with an upper limit of 25-30 micros. 
Extracellular electrode pressure can increase tr and its variability by 2- to 
3-fold. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we modeled passive acetylcholine 
diffusion through a vesicle fusion pore expanding radially at 25 nm x ms(-1) 
(rapid, from endplate omega figure appearance) or 0.275 nm x ms(-1) (slow, from 
mast cell exocytosis). Simulated mEPCs obtained with rapid expansion reproduced 
tr and the overall shape of our experimental mEPCs, and were similar to 
simulated mEPCs obtained with instant acetylcholine release. We conclude that 
passive transmitter diffusion, coupled with rapid expansion of the fusion pore, 
is sufficient to explain the time course of experimentally measured synaptic 
currents with trs of less than 100 micros.}, Institution              =

visual speed perception is qualitatively consistent with a Bayesian observer 
that optimally combines noisy measurements with a prior preference for lower 
speeds. Quantitative validation of this model, however, is difficult because the 
precise noise characteristics and prior expectations are unknown. Here, we 
present an augmented observer model that accounts for the variability of 
subjective responses in a speed discrimination task. This allowed us to infer 
the shape of the prior probability as well as the internal noise characteristics 
directly from psychophysical data. For all subjects, we found that the fitted 
model provides an accurate description of the data across a wide range of 
stimulus parameters. The inferred prior distribution shows significantly heavier 
tails than a Gaussian, and the amplitude of the internal noise is approximately 
proportional to stimulus speed and depends inversely on stimulus contrast. The 
framework is general and should prove applicable to other experiments and

responses could categorize the stimuli. We found that single neurons conveyed 
two different scales of facial information in their firing patterns, starting at 
different latencies. Global information, categorizing stimuli as monkey faces, 
human faces or shapes, was conveyed in the earliest part of the responses. Fine 
information about identity or expression was conveyed later, beginning on 
average 51 ms after global information. We speculate that global information

  Abstract                 = {As animals mature the decay of postsynaptic 
currents become faster at a variety of synapses. This change is thought to 
contribute to a refinement of motor co-ordination and to an increase in the 
precision of sensory perception and cognition. At cholinergic neuromuscular 
synapses and glycinergic and GABAergic inhibitory synapses, the developmental 
speeding of synaptic currents depends upon switches of receptor subunits and an 
ensuing acceleration in the kinetics of channel gating. At glutamatergic 
excitatory synapses, speeding in the decay time of NMDA receptor 
(NMDAR)-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (NMDA-EPSCs) is also dependent 
on developmental switches in NMDAR subunits. However, developmental speeding in 
the kinetics of AMPA receptor (AMPAR)-mediated EPSCs (AMPA-EPSCs) is caused by 
multiple factors. The decay time of AMPA-EPSCs can be shaped by the kinetics of 
channel gating or desensitization of AMPA receptors, depending upon the speed of 
transmitter clearance from the synaptic cleft. During postnatal development 
AMPAR channel gating and desensitization as well as the transmitter clearance 
speed up in kinetics. Given that the developmental speeding of synaptic currents 
play critical roles in the maturation of sensory and motor functions, any defect 
in this mechanism may seriously affect neuronal function.}, Bdsk-url-1

microscopically assessed on 10 pyramidal cells, 7 spiny stellate cells, and 41

on each smooth dendritic neuron and on seven pyramids, but not on spiny stellate

three dendrite-targeting, and three double bouquet cells were scrutinized. All 
basket and dendrite-targeting cells established self-innervation, the number of 
autapses being 12 +/- 7 and 22 +/- 12 (mean +/- SD), respectively; only one of

dendrite-targeting cells (51.8 +/- 49.9 microm; n = 66). The degree of

abundant on GABAergic basket and dendrite-targeting interneurons, with 
subcellular location similar to that of synapses formed by the parent cell on

dendritic neurones on pyramidal and spiny stellate cells were studied in areas 
17 and 18 of the cat visual cortex in vitro. Paired intracellular recordings 
with biocytin-filled electrodes and subsequent light and electron microscopic 
analysis were used to determine the sites of synaptic interaction. 2. All smooth 
dendritic cells established type II synapses previously shown to be made by 
terminals containing GABA, therefore the studied cells are probably GABAergic. 
Three classes of presynaptic cell could be defined, based on their efferent 
synaptic target preference determined from random samples of unlabelled 
postsynaptic cells. (a) Basket cells (n = 6) innervated mainly somata (49.9 +/- 
13.8\%) and dendritic shafts (45.2 +/- 10.7\%) and, to a lesser extent, 
dendritic spines (4.9 +/- 4.6\%). (b) Dendrite-targeting cells (n = 5) 
established synapses predominantly on dendritic shafts (84.3 +/- 9.4\%) and less 
frequently on dendritic spines (11.2 +/- 6.7\%) or somata (4.5 +/- 4.7\%). (c) 
Double bouquet cells (n = 4) preferred dendritic spines (69.2 +/- 4.2\%) to 
dendritic shafts (30.8 +/- 4.2\%) as postsynaptic targets and avoided somata. 3. 
Interneurones formed 5240 +/- 1600 (range, 2830-9690) synaptic junctions in the 
slices. Based on the density of synapses made by single interneurones and the 
volume density of GABAergic synapses, it was calculated that an average 
interneurone provides 0.66 +/- 0.20\% of the GABAergic synapses in its axonal 
field. 4. The location of synaptic junctions on individual, identified 
postsynaptic cells reflected the overall postsynaptic target distribution of the 
same GABAergic neurone. The number of synaptic junctions between pairs of 
neurones could not be predicted from light microscopic examination. The number 
of electron microscopically verified synaptic sites was generally smaller for 
the dendritic domain and larger for the somatic domain than expected from light 
microscopy. All presynaptic cells established multiple synaptic junctions on 
their postsynaptic target cells. A basket cell innervated a pyramidal cell via 
fifteen release sites; the numbers of synapses formed by three 
dendrite-targeting cells on pyramidal cells were seventeen and eight 
respectively, and three on a spiny stellate cell; the interaction between a 
double bouquet cell and a postsynaptic pyramidal cell was mediated by ten 
synaptic junctions. 5. All three types of interneurone (n = 6; 2 for each type 
of cell) elicited short-latency IPSPs with fast rise time (10-90\%; 2.59 +/- 
1.02 ms) and short duration (at half-amplitude, 15.82 +/- 5.24 ms), similar to 
those mediated by GABAA receptors. 6. Average amplitudes of unitary IPSPs (n = 
6) were 845 +/- 796 microV (range, 134-2265 microV). Variability of IPSP 
amplitude was moderate, the average ratio of IPSP and baseline noise variance 
was 1.54 +/- 0.96. High frequency activation of single presynaptic 
dendrite-targeting cells led to an initial summation followed by use-dependent 
depression of the averaged postsynaptic response. Double bouquet cell-evoked 
IPSPs, recorded in the soma, had a smaller amplitude than those evoked by the 
other two cell types. In all connections, transmission failures were rare or 
absent, particularly when mediated by a high number of release sites. 7. The 
results demonstrate that different types of neocortical GABAergic neurones 
innervate distinct domains on the surface of their postsynaptic target cells. 
Nevertheless, all three types of cell studied here elicit fast IPSPs and provide 
GABAergic input through multiple synaptic release sites with few, if any, 
failures of transmission.}, institution = {Department of Pharmacology,

electrophysiological properties were classified by their postsynaptic target 
profile and were identified as basket (BC; n = 6), dendrite-targeting (DTC; n = 
1), and double bouquet (DBC; n = 2) cells. In four out of five anatomically 
fully recovered and reconstructed cell pairs, synaptic connections were found to 
be reciprocal. Generally BCs established synaptic junctions closer (21 +/- 20 
micron) to postsynaptic somata than did DBCs (43 +/- 19 micron; p < 0.01). The 
unitary number of synapses (n values, 10, 7, and 20) in each of three BC-to-BC 
pairs was higher than that in three BC-to-DBC (n values, 1, 2, and 2) and three 
DBC-to-BC (n values, 1, 4, and 4) connections (p < 0.05). A BC innervated a DTC 
through two synaptic junctions. Unitary postsynaptic effects mediated by five 
BCs could be recorded in two BCs, two DBCs, and a DTC. The BCs elicited 
short-duration fast IPSPs, similar to those mediated by GABAA receptors. At a 
membrane potential of -55.0 +/- 6.4 mV, unitary IPSPs (n = 5) had a mean 
amplitude of 919 +/- 863 microV. Postsynaptic response failures were absent when 
an IPSP was mediated by several release sites. Thus, distinct GABAergic

BCs in governing the activity of intracortical GABAergic networks in layers

{1. The inferotemporal cortex (IT) has been thought to play an essential and 
specific role in visual object discrimination and recognition, because a lesion 
of IT in the monkey results in a specific deficit in learning tasks that require 
these visual functions. To understand the cellular basis of the object 
discrimination and recognition processes in IT, we determined the optimal 
stimulus of individual IT cells in anesthetized, immobilized monkeys. 2. In the 
posterior one-third or one-fourth of IT, most cells could be activated maximally 
by bars or disks just by adjusting the size, orientation, or color of the 
stimulus. 3. In the remaining anterior two-thirds or three-quarters of IT, most 
cells required more complex features for their maximal activation. 4. The 
critical feature for the activation of individual anterior IT cells varied from 
cell to cell: a complex shape in some cells and a combination of texture or 
color with contour-shape in other cells. 5. Cells that showed different types of 
complexity for the critical feature were intermingled throughout anterior IT, 
whereas cells recorded in single penetrations showed critical features that were 
related in some respects. 6. Generally speaking, the critical features of 
anterior IT cells were moderately complex and can be thought of as partial 
features common to images of several different natural objects. The selectivity 
to the optimal stimulus was rather sharp, although not absolute. We thus propose 
that, in anterior IT, images of objects are coded by combinations of active 
cells, each of which represents the presence of a particular partial feature in 
the image.}, keywords  = {Animals; Brain Mapping; Colo; Discrimination

simultaneously active. This implies that enhanced synaptic coincidence detection 
would lead to better learning and memory. If the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) 
receptor, a synaptic coincidence detector, acts as a graded switch for memory 
formation, enhanced signal detection by NMDA receptors should enhance learning 
and memory. Here we show that overexpression of NMDA receptor 2B (NR2B) in the 
forebrains of transgenic mice leads to enhanced activation of NMDA receptors, 
facilitating synaptic potentiation in response to stimulation at 10-100 Hz. 
These mice exhibit superior ability in learning and memory in various 
behavioural tasks, showing that NR2B is critical in gating the age-dependent 
threshold for plasticity and memory formation. NMDA-receptor-dependent 
modifications of synaptic efficacy, therefore, represent a unifying mechanism 
for associative learning and memory. Our results suggest that genetic 
enhancement of mental and cognitive attributes such as intelligence and memory 
in mammals is feasible.},

neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) of autism and mental retardation propose 
that abnormal connectivity underlies deficits in attentional processing. We 
tested this theory by studying unitary synaptic connections between layer 5 
pyramidal neurons within medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) networks in the Fmr1-KO 
mouse model for mental retardation and autism. In line with predictions from 
neurocognitive theory, we found that neighboring pyramidal neurons were 
hyperconnected during a critical period in early mPFC development. Surprisingly, 
excitatory synaptic connections between Fmr1-KO pyramidal neurons were 
significantly slower and failed to recover from short-term depression as quickly 
as wild type (WT) synapses. By 4-5 weeks of mPFC development, connectivity rates 
were identical for both KO and WT pyramidal neurons and synapse dynamics changed 
from depressing to facilitating responses with similar properties in both 
groups. We propose that the early alteration in connectivity and synaptic 
recovery are tightly linked: using a network model, we show that slower synapses 
are essential to counterbalance hyperconnectivity in order to maintain a dynamic 
range of excitatory activity. However, the slow synaptic time constants induce 
decreased responsiveness to low-frequency stimulation, which may explain 
deficits in integration and early information processing in attentional neuronal 
networks in NDDs.}, bdsk-url-1  = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhr224}, doi

  Abstract                 = {LTP and other rapidly induced forms of synaptic 
modification tune individual synaptic weights, whereas slower forms of 
plasticity such as adaptation to inactivity are thought to keep neurons within 
their firing limits and preserve their capability for information processing. 
Here we describe progress in understanding the relationship between LTP and 
adaptation to inactivity. A prevailing view is that adaptation to inactivity is 
purely postsynaptic, scales synaptic strength uniformly across all synapses, and 
thus preserves relative synaptic weights without interfering with signatures of 
prior LTP or the relative capacity for future LTP. However, recent evidence in 
hippocampal neurons indicates that, like LTP, adaptation to AMPA receptor 
blockade can draw upon a repertoire of synaptic expression mechanisms including 
enhancement of presynaptic vesicular turnover and increased quantal amplitude 
mediated by recruitment of homomeric GluR1 AMPA receptors. These pre- and 
postsynaptic changes appeared coordinated and preferentially expressed at subset 
of synapses, thereby increasing the variability of miniature EPSCs. In contrast 
to the NMDA receptor-, Ca2+ entry-dependent induction of LTP, adaptation to 
inactivity may be mediated by attenuation of voltage-sensitive L-type Ca2+ 
channel function. The associated intracellular signaling involves elevation of 
betaCaMKII, which in turn downregulates alphaCaMKII, a key player in LTP. Thus, 
adaptation to inactivity and LTP are not strictly independent with regard to 
mechanisms of signaling and expression. Indeed, we and others have found that 
responses to LTP-inducing stimuli can be sharply altered by prior inactivity, 
suggesting that the slow adaptation changes the rules of plasticity-an 
interesting example of "metaplasticity".}, Doi                      =

their molecular basis is largely unknown. Our data indicate that prolonged AMPAR 
blockade acts through loss of Ca2+ entry through L-type Ca2+ channels to bring 
about an increase in both vesicle pool size and turnover rate, as well as a 
postsynaptic enhancement of the contribution of GluR1 homomers, concentrated at 
the largest synapses. The changes were consistent with a morphological scaling 
of overall synapse size, but also featured a dramatic shift toward synaptic 
drive contributed by the Ca2+-permeable homomeric GluR1 receptors. These results 
extend beyond "synaptic homeostasis" to involve more profound changes that can 
be better described as "metaplasticity".}, Doi                      =

  Abstract                 = {1. To compare the dynamics of synaptic 
transmission at different types of connection, dual intracellular recordings 
were made from pairs of neurones in slices of adult rat neocortex. Excitatory 
postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) were elicited by single spikes, spike pairs and 
brief spike trains in presynaptic pyramidal cells and responses recorded in 
postsynaptic pyramidal cells and in interneurones. 2. Pyramid-pyramid EPSPs were 
strongly voltage dependent and this resulted in a range of paired pulse effects. 
At thirty-two of sixty-nine pyramid-pyramid connections, the 2nd EPSP was the 
same shape as the 1st, indicating minimal interaction between active synapses. 
In these thirty-two connections, paired pulse depression (PPD) was apparent (2nd 
EPSP integral 46 +/- 21\% of the 1st, at 5-20 ms), which recovered within 60-70 
ms. 3. In eleven additional pyramid-pyramid pairs, the 2nd EPSP was also the 
same shape as the 1st, but paired pulse facilitation (PPF, 149 +/- 32\%) 
decaying within 50-60 ms was apparent. Even these connections displayed 
frequency-dependent depression, however, as 3rd EPSPs were smaller than 1st 
EPSPs at intervals < 100 ms. 4. At twenty-five pyramid-pyramid connections, 2nd 
EPSPs were broader than 1st EPSPs and in sixteen of these, voltage- and NMDA 
receptor-dependent enhancement was large enough to obscure the underlying PPD. 
PPD was revealed by postsynaptic hyperpolarization (4 pairs), 
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blockade (3 paris), or if Mg2+ was removed 
(in the one case studied). If synapse location allowed significant 
depolarization of one active site by another, voltage-dependent enhancement 
could produce supralinear EPSP summation and overcome PPD. Third EPSPs were, 
however, consistently smaller than 1st EPSPs. 5. In striking contrast, profound 
frequency-dependent facilitation, independent of voltage or NMDA receptors was 
seen at fifteen connections involving two classes of postsynaptic interneurones. 
6. At these pyramid-interneurone connections, facilitation of the 2nd EPSP (655 
+/- 380\% at 5-20 ms) decayed rapidly, within 50-60 ms. Third and fourth EPSPs 
showed additional facilitation which decayed more slowly, within 90 ms and 2 s, 
respectively. Facilitation due to five to six spike trains was still apparent at 
3 s. Therefore, once initiated by a brief high frequency spike train, 
facilitation was maintained at lower frequencies.}, Institution              =

  Abstract                 = {1. In slices of rat sensorimotor cortex, dual 
intracellular recordings were obtained from 1,952 pairs of deep layer pyramidal 
neurons. Where action potentials in one neurone elicited excitatory postsynaptic 
potentials (EPSPs, n = 56) in the other, responses to different presynaptic 
firing rates and patterns and at different postsynaptic membrane potentials were 
recorded and on some occasions both neurons were filled with biocytin. 2. Slices 
were fixed, sectioned again at 60 microns, and incubated with Avidin horseradish 
peroxidase (HRP), which was then visualized using the 3,3'-diaminobenzidine 
tetrahydrochloride (DAB) method. All neurones reported here that were identified 
histologically were pyramidal cells with their somata in the deep layers (V and 
VI). 3. One in 70 of the tests performed revealed a synaptic connection, 25 of 
which were studied in detail. Mean EPSP amplitude was 1.67 +/- 1.66 (SD) mV, 
with some single sweep events as large as 9 mV. For some of the smaller EPSPs 
the amplitude distributions contained a clear peak around 0 mV, the coefficient 
of variation (CV) was large, and paired pulse facilitation was apparent. EPSPs 
with large average amplitudes displayed no apparent failures of transmission, 
EPSP amplitudes were fairly evenly distributed around the mean, CVs were small, 
and paired pulse depression was apparent in 2.5 mM extracellular Ca2+. When 
single sweeps were selected according to the size of the first EPSP, large 
second EPSPs were found to follow small first EPSPs and small second EPSPs to 
follow large first EPSPs. Paired pulse effects appeared, in the majority of 
tests, to be due to a change in presynaptic release probability. 4. Two EPSPs 
were recorded in three different extracellular Ca2+ concentrations. In 1 mM 
Ca2+, the first EPSP of a short interval pair was small and paired pulse 
facilitation was apparent. In 5 mM Ca2+, first EPSPs were between 2.5 and 4 
times larger than in 1 mM Ca2+ and paired pulse depression was apparent. In all 
Ca2+ concentrations however, averaged third and fourth EPSPs of brief bursts 
were of similar amplitudes and smaller than second EPSPs. If presynaptic 
inhibition does contribute to paired pulse effects here, it is not overcome by a 
combination of raised extracellular Ca2+ and repetitive presynaptic firing. 5. 
These EPSPs displayed a wide range of time courses. The mean 10-90\% rise time 
was 2.49 +/- 1.08 ms, the mean width at half amplitude was 15.39 +/- 5.42 ms (n 
= 22), and the mean EPSP latency was 1.59 +/- 0.68 ms (n = 18). (ABSTRACT

propionic acid) receptors mediate fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the 
brain. These ion channels rapidly deactivate and desensitize, which determine 
the time course of synaptic transmission. Here, we find that the AMPA receptor 
interacting protein, stargazin, not only mediates AMPA receptor trafficking but 
also shapes synaptic responses by slowing channel deactivation and 
desensitization. The cytoplasmic tail of stargazin determines receptor 
trafficking, whereas the ectodomain controls channel properties. Stargazin 
alters AMPA receptor kinetics by increasing the rate of channel opening. 
Disrupting the interaction of stargazin ectodomain with hippocampal AMPA 
receptors alters the amplitude and shape of synaptic responses, establishing a 
crucial function for stargazin in controlling the efficacy of synaptic 
transmission in the brain.}, Bdsk-url-1               =

that neurons can effectively transmit information, (2) homeostatic processes 
stabilize the mean firing rate of the postsynaptic neuron, and (3) weak synapses 
adapt more slowly than strong ones, while maintenance of strong synapses is 
costly. Our results show that a synaptic update rule derived from these 
principles shares features, with spike-timing-dependent plasticity, is sensitive 
to correlations in the input and is useful for synaptic memory. Moreover, input 
selectivity (sharply tuned receptive fields) of postsynaptic neurons develops 
only if stimuli with strong features are presented. Sharply tuned neurons can 
coexist with unselective ones, and the distribution of synaptic weights can be 
unimodal or bimodal. The formulation of synaptic dynamics through an optimality 
criterion provides a simple graphical argument for the stability of synapses, 
necessary for synaptic memory.}, Bdsk-url-1               =

update rule exhibits all of the features of the Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro rule, 
in particular, regimes of synaptic potentiation and depression separated by a 
sliding threshold. Moreover, the learning rule is also applicable to the more 
realistic case of neuron models with refractoriness, and is sensitive to 
correlations between input spikes, even in the absence of presynaptic rate 
modulation. The learning rule is found by maximizing the mutual information 
between presynaptic and postsynaptic spike trains under the constraint that the 
postsynaptic firing rate stays close to some target firing rate. An 
interpretation of the synaptic update rule in terms of homeostatic synaptic

{Significant advances in cognitive neuroscience can be achieved by combining 
techniques used to measure behavior and brain activity with neural modeling. 
Here we apply this approach to the initiation of rapid eye movements (saccades), 
which are used to redirect the visual axis to targets of interest. It is well 
known that the superior colliculus (SC) in the midbrain plays a major role in 
generating saccadic eye movements, and physiological studies have provided 
important knowledge of the activity pattern of neurons in this structure. Based 
on the observation that the SC receives localized sensory (exogenous) and 
voluntary (endogenous) inputs, our model assumes that this information is 
integrated by dynamic competition across local collicular interactions. The 
model accounts well for the effects upon saccadic reaction time (SRT) due to 
removal of fixation, the presence of distractors, execution of pro- versus 
antisaccades, and variation in target probability, and suggests a possible 
mechanism for the generation of express saccades. In each of these cases, the 
activity patterns of "neurons" within the model closely resemble actual cell 
behavior in the intermediate layer of the SC. The interaction structure we 
employ is instrumental for producing a physiologically faithful model and 
results in new insights and hypotheses regarding the neural mechanisms 
underlying saccade initiation.}, institution = {University of Oxford, UK.},

suggested that this perceptual segregation did not depend on the presence of two 
peaks in the population activity. Rather, the visual system seemed to use 
overall shape of the population response to determine the number and directions 
of motion components. This approach explained a number of perceptual phenomena, 
including susceptibility of the motion system to direction metamers, motion 
patterns combining three or five directions incorrectly perceived by subjects as 
comprising only two directions. Our findings offer insights into the coding of 
multi-valued sensory signals and provide constraints for biologically based 
computational models.}, bdsk-url-1  = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/72985}, doi

slow and fast variability in the inputs that produce neuronal activation, is

  Abstract                 = {Neurons in the cochlear ganglion and auditory 
brain stem nuclei preserve the relative timing of action potentials passed 
through sequential synaptic levels. To accomplish this task, these neurons have 
unique morphological and biophysical specializations in axons, dendrites, and 
nerve terminals. At the membrane level, these adaptations include low-threshold, 
voltage-gated potassium channels and unusually rapid-acting transmitter-gated 
channels, which govern how quickly and reliably action potential threshold is 
reached during a synaptic response. Some nerve terminals are remarkably large 
and release large amounts of excitatory neurotransmitter. The high output of 
transmitter at these terminals can lead to synaptic depression, which may itself 
be regulated by presynaptic transmitter receptors. The way in which these 
different cellular mechanisms are employed varies in different cell types and 
circuits and reflects refinements suited to different aspects of acoustic 
processing.}, Bdsk-url-1               =

long been held to be a more gradual process. We now report, however, that

experiments using a hippocampal-dependent paired-associate task for rats, the 
memory of flavor-place associations became persistent over time as a putative 
neocortical schema gradually developed. New traces, trained for only one trial, 
then became assimilated and rapidly hippocampal-independent. Schemas also played 
a causal role in the creation of lasting associative memory representations

psychological accounts of knowledge structures with neurobiological theories of

been found to fire synchronously on the time scale of several milliseconds. This 
near coincident firing of neurons could coordinate the multifaceted information 
of different features of a stimulus. The mechanisms of generating such synchrony 
are not clear. We simulated the activity of a population of excitatory and 
inhibitory neurons randomly interconnected into a recurrent network via synapses 
that display temporal dynamics in their transmission; surprisingly, we found a 
behavior of the network where action potential activity spontaneously 
self-organized to produce highly synchronous bursts involving virtually the 
entire network. These population bursts were also triggered by stimuli to the 
network in an all-or-none manner. We found that the particular intensities of 
the external stimulus to specific neurons were crucial to evoke population 
bursts. This topographic sensitivity therefore depends on the spectrum of basal 
discharge rates across the population and not on the anatomical individuality of 
the neurons, because this was random. These results suggest that networks in 
which neurons are even randomly interconnected via frequency-dependent synapses 
could exhibit a novel form of reflex response that is sensitive to the nature of 
the stimulus as well as the background spontaneous activity.}, Institution

  abstract             = {Alzheimer's disease is caused by increased production or reduced 
clearance of amyloid-Î², which results in the formation amyloid-Î² plaques and 
triggers a cascade of downstream events leading to progressive 
neurodegeneration. The earliest clinical symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, i.e., 
memory loss, are however poorly understood from a molecular and cellular 
perspective. Here we used APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic mice to study the 
early pre-pathological effects of increased amyloid-Î² levels on hippocampal 
synaptic plasticity and memory. Using an unbiased proteomics approach we show 
that the early increase in amyloid-Î² levels in APP/PS1 mice at three months of 
age coincides with a robust and significant upregulation of several protein 
components of the extracellular matrix in hippocampal synaptosome preparations. 
This increase in extracellular matrix levels occurred well before the onset of 
plaque formation and was paralleled by impairments in hippocampal long-term 
potentiation and contextual memory. Direct injection into the hippocampus of the 
extracellular matrix inactivating enzyme chondroitinase ABC restored both 
long-term potentiation and contextual memory performance. These findings 
indicate an important role for the extracellular matrix in causing early memory 
loss in Alzheimer's disease.},

{Age-related cognitive decline is a serious health concern in our aging society. 
Decreased cognitive function observed during healthy brain aging is most likely 
caused by changes in brain connectivity and synaptic dysfunction in particular 
brain regions. Here we show that aged C57BL/6J wild-type mice have 
hippocampus-dependent spatial memory impairments. To identify the molecular 
mechanisms that are relevant to these memory deficits, we investigated the 
temporal profile of mouse hippocampal synaptic proteome changes at 20, 40, 50, 
60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 weeks of age. Extracellular matrix proteins were the 
only group of proteins that showed robust and progressive up-regulation over 
time. This was confirmed by immunoblotting and histochemical analysis, which 
indicated that the increased levels of hippocampal extracellular matrix might 
limit synaptic plasticity as a potential cause of age-related cognitive decline. 
In addition, we observed that stochasticity in synaptic protein expression 
increased with age, in particular for proteins that were previously linked with 
various neurodegenerative diseases, whereas low variance in expression was 
observed for proteins that play a basal role in neuronal function and synaptic 
neurotransmission. Together, our findings show that both specific changes and 
increased variance in synaptic protein expression are associated with aging and 
may underlie reduced synaptic plasticity and impaired cognitive performance in 
old age.}, chemicals            = {Extracellular Matrix Proteins, Proteome},

  Abstract                 = {Neuronal networks are balanced by mechanisms of 
homeostatic plasticity, which adjusts synaptic strength via molecular and 
morphological changes in the pre- and post-synapse. Here, we wondered whether 
the hyaluronic acid-based extracellular matrix (ECM) of the brain is involved in 
mechanisms of homeostatic plasticity. We hypothesized that the ECM, being rich 
in chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans such as brevican, which are suggested to 
stabilize synapses by their inhibitory effect on structural plasticity, must be 
remodelled to allow for structural and molecular changes during conditions of 
homeostatic plasticity. We found a high abundance of cleaved brevican fragments 
throughout the hippocampus and cortex and in neuronal cultures, with the 
strongest labelling in perineuronal nets on parvalbumin-positive interneurons. 
Using an antibody specific for a brevican fragment cleaved by the matrix 
metalloprotease ADAMTS4, we identified the enzyme as the main 
brevican-processing protease. Interestingly, we found ADAMTS4 largely associated 
with synapses. After inducing homeostatic plasticity in neuronal cell cultures 
by prolonged network inactivation, we found increased brevican processing at 
inhibitory as well as excitatory synapses, which is in line with the ADAMTS4 
subcellular localization. Thus, the ECM is remodelled in conditions of 
homeostatic plasticity, which may liberate synapses to allow for a higher degree 
of structural plasticity.}, Chemicals                = {Brevican, Hyaluronic

as direct depolarization results in an increase in Ih recorded from 
cell-attached patches in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. This mechanism 
requires Ca2+ influx but not increased levels of cAMP. Artificially increasing 
Ih by using a dynamic clamp during whole-cell current clamp recordings results 
in reduced firing rates in response to depolarizing current injections. We 
conclude that modulation of somatic Ih represents a previously uncharacterized

shown that spine length can be altered by manipulations that affect

affecting protein synthesis in neurons. We have investigated how ligands of 
group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) affect spine shape; 
stimulation of these receptors leads both to calcium release from intracellular 
stores and to dendritic protein synthesis. Thirty-minute incubation of cultured 
hippocampal slices and dissociated neurons with the selective group 1 mGluR 
agonist (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) induced a significant increase in 
the average length of dendritic spines. This elongation resulted mainly from the 
growth of existing spines and was also seen even in the presence of antagonists 
of ionotropic receptors, indicating that activation of these receptors by 
mGluR-induced glutamate release was not required. Prolonged antagonism of group 
1 mGluRs with (S)-alpha-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine (MCPG) did not result in 
shorter average spine length. Elongation of dendritic spines induced by DHPG was 
blocked by calcium chelation and by preincubation with the protein synthesis 
inhibitor puromycin. The results suggest that in vivo activation of group 1 
mGluRs by synaptically released glutamate affects spine shape in a protein 
synthesis-dependent manner.},

must be simultaneously processed? We show that in the presence of competing 
objects, performance in the near absence of attention depends on the relative 
distance between stimuli: discrimination is good for stimuli far enough apart, 
and poor for close enough stimuli. In contrast, seemingly simpler but unfamiliar 
synthetic objects could not be bound in the near absence of attention, 
independent of the distance between them. Thus, natural objects are special in 
that they suffer from the binding problem, but only locally. We surmise that 
this particular type of local binding for natural objects and scenes could be 
"hardwired" by dedicated neuronal populations.}, bdsk-url-1  =

component of the glutamatergic EPSC in mammalian central neurons. The current 
through NMDARs is voltage dependent as a result of block by extracellular 
magnesium, which has recently been shown to give rise to a complex time 
dependence, with fast and slow components of responses to changes in membrane 
potential. Here, we studied the dynamics of block and unblock by measuring 
voltage step responses in conjunction with fast perfusion of agonist in 
nucleated patches isolated from rat cortical pyramidal neurons. We found that 
slow unblock shows a progressive onset during synaptic-like responses to brief 
pulses of agonist. Repolarizing briefly from +40 to -70 mV revealed that slow 
unblock is reestablished with a time constant of approximately 5 msec at room 
temperature. Also, the time course of deactivation, in response to a pulse of 
agonist, slows twofold over the potential range -30 to +40 mV. An asymmetric 
"trapping block" model in which the voltage-independent closing rate constant of 
the blocked channel is approximately three times that of the unblocked channel 
accounts quantitatively for all of these phenomena and for responses to action 
potential waveform clamp. This model allows much more accurate prediction of 
NMDAR current in physiological conditions of magnesium concentration and 
changing membrane potential than previously possible. It suggests a positive 
allosteric link between occupation of the NMDAR pore by magnesium and closure of 
the permeation gate.}, Bdsk-url-1               =

component (tau = 14-23 ms in nucleated patches). The slow component accounted 
for half of the current at +40 mV and its amplitude and time constant showed 
some voltage dependence. Blocking with hyperpolarization was very fast (tau < 
200 micros). Voltage-clamp with action potential waveforms, at both room 
temperature and at 33 degrees C, showed that the rising phase of single fast 
action potentials unblocks far less NMDAR current than expected from the 
stationary voltage dependence, while a large amplitude of current is uncovered 
during the upstroke of slow calcium action potentials. The repolarization of 
fast sodium action potentials uncovers an NMDAR tail current, much bigger than

increased hypometria and dysmetria. Similar effects by either reduced inhibition 
or increased excitation suggest that a variety of pharmacological compounds can 
be used for both screening and medical management. On the other hand, any change 
to the microscopic neuron anatomy that increases the effective maximum distance 
between excitatory neurons decreases hypometria but has no affect on 
dysmetria.Perturbations to a computational model of a local cerebral cortical

action of a standard quantity of transmitter, the quantum (Del Castillo and 
Katz, J Physiol 124:560-573, 1954). Quantal packets of transmitter were proposed 
to be preformed (Del Castillo and Katz, In CNRS Paris (Ed): "Microphysiologie 
compar?e des ?l?ments excitables" 67:245-258, 1957) and stored in large numbers 
in the motor nerve terminal. Statistical analyses of intervals between MEPPs and 
numbers of quanta composing small endplate potentials indicated that quantal 
release was a random process and that release sites functioned independently of 
each other. With the discovery of synaptic vesicles it was proposed that each 
contained one quantum of transmitter. The quantal-vesicular hypothesis (Del 
Castillo and Katz, as cited above) fails, however, to explain amplitude 
distributions of MEPPs that are skewed and/or that show multiple peaks (Kriebel 
et al., Brain Res Review 15:167-178, 1990). The drop formation process (Shaw, 
"The Dripping Faucet as a Model Chaotic System," Santa Cruz, CA: Aerial Press, 
Inc., 1984) was shown to generate amplitude classes of drops that were similar 
to classes of MEPPs which suggested that rapid changes in quantal size and 
ratios of skew- to bell-MEPPs could be explained with a simple dynamic process 
which determines quantal size at the moment of release (Kriebel et al., as cited 
above, 1990). Further similarities between miniature endplate currents (MEPCs) 
and the formation of drops are reported here. We found that rapid changes in 
MEPC amplitudes and time courses, which accompany an increase in frequency, 
mimic changes in drop sizes that accompany increases in flow rate. MEPC 
intervals have a minimum and their distributions are comparable to those of drop 
intervals. During an increased rate of transmitter release, MEPP amplitudes and 
intervals were positively correlated. The results suggest that spontaneously 
released transmitter "packets" are formed at the moment of release and that 
transmitter supply to the process that forms packets is continuous.}, Bdsk-url-1

  Abstract                 = {In 1952 Fatt and Katz recorded at a frog 
neuromuscular junction while stimulating the nerve and found "... that 
successive endplate potential responses varied in a step-like manner, 
corresponding to units of miniature endplate potentials" (J Physiol 117, 
109-128). This led them to propose that fast neuromuscular transmission is 
'quantal'. Quantal release is now commonly ascribed to a vesicular form of 
neurosecretion since vesicles have routinely been visualized in presynaptic 
terminals. The vesicular hypothesis (Del Castillo and Katz, 1955) assumes that 
quanta, or 'transmitter packets of standard size', are assembled and stored in 
the numerous vesicles routinely identified in micrographs of virtually all 
central and peripheral presynaptic nerve terminals. Simply stated, this model 
predicts that each one of the miniature synaptic signals (MSSs) follows from the 
exocytosis of one vesicle's contents. However, the time required for membrane 
fusion preceding exocytosis (Almers and Tse, 1990) and the variability in MSS 
amplitude and time course (Vautrin et al, 1992a,b) cannot readily be reconciled 
by a simple, exocytotic model of quantal release from preloaded vesicles. These 
difficulties with the original model have led us to re-evaluate MSSs generated 
at the classical peripheral synapse, the cholinergic neuromuscular junction of 
the mouse diaphragm, as well as at central synapses between embryonic 
hippocampal neurons mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). At these 
synapses, the release of GABA is also assumed to have classical quantal 
properties like peripheral acetylcholine release (Edwards et al, 1990). Our 
results show that at both synapses, progressive alterations in elementary signal 
properties can be induced in a remarkably rapid manner. The original report of 
preferred amplitudes and intervals in the spontaneous miniature signals (Fatt 
and Katz, 1952) has repeatedly been confirmed and is here incorporated into a 
dynamic model of fast synaptic transmission. Although MSSs exhibit variable 
rise-times and peak amplitudes, they can both be described in terms of 
synchronization of transmitter release. We have reviewed many experimental 
findings, which together strongly suggest that the original interpretation of 
Fatt and Katz (1952) regarding MSSs as reflecting the non-propagated 
'neurogenic' activity of 'terminal spots' may be a useful concept to pursue 
since it may help to explain part of the underlying molecular basis of quantal 
release.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)}, Institution              =

  Abstract                 = {The cystic fibrosis gene product cystic fibrosis 
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a low conductance, cAMP-regulated 
Cl- channel. Removal of cytosolic ATP causes a cessation of cAMP-dependent 
kinase-phosphorylated CFTR channel activity that resumes upon ATP addition. 
(Anderson, M. P., H. A. Berger, D. R. Rich, R. J. Gregory, A. E. Smith, and M. 
J. Welsh. 1991. Cell. 67:775-784). The aim of this study was to quantify 
possible effects of ATP on CFTR gating. We analyzed multichannel records since 
only 1 of 64 patches contained a single channel. ATP increased the channel open 
probability (Po) as a simple Michaelis-Menten function of concentration; the 
effect was half maximal at 24 microM, reached a maximum of 0.44, and had a Hill 
coefficient of 1.13. Since the maximum Po was not 1, the simplest description of 
the effect of ATP on CFTR gating is the noncooperative three-state mechanism of 
del Castillo and Katz (1957. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. B. 
146:369-381). We analyzed current fluctuations to quantify possible changes in 
CFTR gating. The power density spectra appeared to contain a single Lorentzian 
in the range of 0.096-31 Hz. Analysis of the corner frequency (fc) of this 
Lorentzian revealed that ATP increased 2 pi fc as a Michaelis-Menten function 
with a Hill coefficient of 1.08, and it provided estimates of the ATP 
dissociation constant (44 tau open (154 ms), and the ATP-sensitive tau close 
[(185 ms) (44 microM/[ATP] + 1)]. These results suggest that the binding 
reaction is rapid compared to the opening and closing rates. Assuming that there 
is a single set of closed-to-open transitions, it is possible to verify the 
outcome of fluctuation analysis by comparing fluctuation-derived estimates of Po 
with measures of Po from current records. The two values were nearly identical. 
Thus, noise analysis provides a quantitative description of the effect of ATP on 
CFTR opening. The noncooperative three-state model should serve as a basis to 
understand possible alterations in CFTR gating resulting from regulators or 
point mutations.}, Institution              = {Department of Physiology and

studies suggest that primary visual cortex (area V1) uses a sparse code to 
efficiently represent natural scenes. This issue was investigated by recording 
from V1 neurons in awake behaving macaques during both free viewing of natural 
scenes and conditions simulating natural vision. Stimulation of the nonclassical 
receptive field increases the selectivity and sparseness of individual V1 
neurons, increases the sparseness of the population response distribution, and 
strongly decorrelates the responses of neuron pairs. These effects are due to 
both excitatory and suppressive modulation of the classical receptive field by 
the nonclassical receptive field and do not depend critically on the 
spatiotemporal structure of the stimuli. During natural vision, the classical 
and nonclassical receptive fields function together to form a sparse 
representation of the visual world. This sparse code may be computationally

{Contour orientation discrimination accuracy is determined by the orientation 
bandwidth, response variance and response strength of single units that code for 
orientation. We measured the latter three properties for V1 cells of monkeys 
which were performing an orientation discrimination of the grating stimulating 
the cell under study. We recorded from 285 cells, of which 76\% responded to the 
grating. The orientation bandwidth, measured as full width at half height of the 
tuning curve, varied over a wide range amongst cells. The median bandwidth was 
41 degrees. The response variance of the cells also varied considerably between 
cells; on average it was about two times the response strength. We also studied 
the temporal properties of the responses. Most of our cells had a latency 
between 40 and 100 ms. The response variance was found to be smaller in the 
initial phases of the response than at the later response stages. In some cells 
the orientation tuning varied in successive stages of the response, while in 
others the orientation bandwidth and preferred orientation remained stable 
throughout the response. However, all orientation sensitive cells were 
orientation tuned from the start of the response, a property which contribute to 
the fast and reliable coding of contour orientation. These results provide for 
the first time an estimation of the orientation tuning properties of V1 cells 
during visual orientation discrimination. They will be very useful to compare 
single cell properties of other areas to as well as in simulation studies of 
models of primate visual discriminations.}, keywords  = {Animals; Discrimination

malformations of dendritic protrusions occur. One hypothesized cause of the

this study, we examined the effect of the mGluR5 antagonist MPEP on Fragile X

prepulse inhibition of startle in Fmr1 KO mice, that could be rescued by MPEP.

underlying afferent-specific synaptic conductances are associated with different

at the site of the synapse, we demonstrate that MF and CL synapses overlap in 
electrotonic location yet differ in conductance time course. Thus, 
afferent-specific conductance time courses allow single interneurons to 
differentially integrate feedforward and feedback information without the need 
to segregate distinct AMPA receptor subunits to different electrotonic

of 8 filter paper unit (FPU)/mL, close to that obtainable from pure cellulosic 
substrates. The yield of cellulase enzyme was 307 FPU/g glucan of de-ashed 
sludge. Specific activity was 8.0 FPU/mg protein. In activity tests conducted 
against the corn stover and alpha-cellulose, the xylanse activity was found to 
be higher than that of a commercial cellulase. Relatively high xylan content in 
the sludge appears to have induced high xylanase production. Simultaneous 
saccharification and fermentation (SSF) was performed using partially de-ashed 
sludge as the feedstock for ethanol production using Sacharomyces cerevisiae and 
the cellulase produced in-house from the sludge. With 6\% (w/v) glucan feed, 
ethanol yield of 72\% of theoretical maximum and 24.4 g/L ethanol concentration 
were achieved. These results were identical to those of the SSF using commercial 
cellulases.}, bdsk-url-1  = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-009-8863-x}, doi

generate persistent activity that outlasts stimuli and is resistant to 
distractors, presumed to be the basis of working memory. The pyramidal network 
that supports this activity is unknown. Multineuron patch-clamp recordings in 
the ferret medial prefrontal cortex showed a heterogeneity of synapses 
interconnecting distinct subnetworks of different pyramidal cells. One 
subnetwork was similar to the pyramidal network commonly found in primary 
sensory areas, consisting of accommodating pyramidal cells interconnected with 
depressing synapses. The other subnetwork contained complex pyramidal cells with 
dual apical dendrites displaying nonaccommodating discharge patterns; these 
cells were hyper-reciprocally connected with facilitating synapses displaying 
pronounced synaptic augmentation and post-tetanic potentiation. These cellular, 
synaptic and network properties could amplify recurrent interactions between 
pyramidal neurons and support persistent activity in the prefrontal cortex.},

contributions to our understanding of the nature and neurobiological 
underpinnings of mammalian memory. Only in recent years, however, have 
researchers begun to elucidate the specific brain areas and neural processes 
involved in object recognition memory. The present review considers some of this 
recent research, with an emphasis on studies addressing the neural bases of 
perirhinal cortex-dependent object recognition memory processes. We first 
briefly discuss operational definitions of object recognition and the common 
behavioural tests used to measure it in non-human primates and rodents. We then 
consider research from the non-human primate and rat literature examining the 
anatomical basis of object recognition memory in the delayed 
nonmatching-to-sample (DNMS) and spontaneous object recognition (SOR) tasks, 
respectively. The results of these studies overwhelmingly favor the view that 
perirhinal cortex (PRh) is a critical region for object recognition memory. We 
then discuss the involvement of PRh in the different stages--encoding, 
consolidation, and retrieval--of object recognition memory. Specifically, recent 
work in rats has indicated that neural activity in PRh contributes to object 
memory encoding, consolidation, and retrieval processes. Finally, we consider 
the pharmacological, cellular, and molecular factors that might play a part in 
PRh-mediated object recognition memory. Recent studies in rodents have begun to 
indicate the remarkable complexity of the neural substrates underlying this 
seemingly simple aspect of declarative memory.}, bdsk-url-1  =

Abstract We study the performance of the maximum likelihood (ML) method in 
population decoding as a function of the population size. Assuming uncorrelated 
noise in neural responses, the ML performance, quantified by the expected square 
difference between the estimated and the actual quantity, follows closely the 
optimal Cramer?Rao bound, provided that the population size is sufficiently 
large. However, when the population size decreases below a certain threshold, 
the performance of the ML method undergoes a rapid deterioration, experiencing a 
large deviation from the optimal bound. We explain the cause of such threshold 
behaviour, and present a phenomenological approach for estimating the threshold 
population size, which is found to be linearly proportional to the inverse of 
the square of the system?s signal-to-noise ratio. If the ML method is used by 
neural systems, we expect the number of neurons involved in population coding to 
be above this threshold. 1. Introduction Information in neural systems is often 
encoded by populations of neurons. By using population codes, neural systems 
gain robustness against damage to individual or a small number of neurons, and 
reduce errors caused by neuronal noise [1?3]. Examples of population codes exist 
in a variety of sensory and motor domains, such as intended movement directions 
encoded in the primate motor cortex [4], orientations and directions encoded in 
the primate visual cortex [5], physical locations encoded in hippocampal place 
cells [6, 7] and wind directions encoded in the cricket cercal sensory system 
[8]. Several approaches have been proposed for a neural system to ?read out? the 
population encoded information. The most straightforward is the centre of mass 
approach,which estimates the encoded information by the weighted sum of the 
preferred values of individual neurons with weights specified by neural 
activities [9, 10]. The second approach is the population vector,

= {Novel motor skills are learned through repetitive practice and, once 
acquired, persist long after training stops. Earlier studies have shown that 
such learning induces an increase in the efficacy of synapses in the primary 
motor cortex, the persistence of which is associated with retention of the task. 
However, how motor learning affects neuronal circuitry at the level of 
individual synapses and how long-lasting memory is structurally encoded in the 
intact brain remain unknown. Here we show that synaptic connections in the 
living mouse brain rapidly respond to motor-skill learning and permanently 
rewire. Training in a forelimb reaching task leads to rapid (within an hour) 
formation of postsynaptic dendritic spines on the output pyramidal neurons in 
the contralateral motor cortex. Although selective elimination of spines that 
existed before training gradually returns the overall spine density back to the 
original level, the new spines induced during learning are preferentially 
stabilized during subsequent training and endure long after training stops. 
Furthermore, we show that different motor skills are encoded by different sets 
of synapses. Practice of novel, but not previously learned, tasks further 
promotes dendritic spine formation in adulthood. Our findings reveal that rapid, 
but long-lasting, synaptic reorganization is closely associated with motor 
learning. The data also suggest that stabilized neuronal connections are the 
foundation of durable motor memory.}, bdsk-url-1  =

nonsynaptic epileptogenesis induced in the CA1 area of rat hippocampal slices by 
lowering [Ca2]o was studied with K+-selective microelectrodes (KSMs). 
Extracellular field potentials and [K+]o were recorded simultaneously with 1-2 
KSMs in the CA1 stratum pyramidale. In slices perfused with an oxygenated 
standard physiological solution (containing 2 mM Ca2+), base-line [K+]o was 
stable for several hours. The washout of Ca2+o was accompanied by a gradual 
tonic rise of [K+]o. Spontaneous and stimulus-evoked maximal seizurelike events 
(SLEs) appeared when [K+]o was approximately 0.5 mM above the initial 5 mM base 
line. These changes were reversible in normal medium. When K+o was pressure 
ejected in the CA1 stratum pyramidale of spontaneously active slices, a local 
rise in [K+]o of approximately 0.5 mM was necessary to trigger a SLE. A similar 
apparent [K+]o "threshold" was associated with SLEs evoked by electrical 
stimulation. Increasing [K+] in the perfusing solution by small increments (1 
mM) markedly enhanced SLEs frequency and velocity of spread and decreased the 
period of absolute refractoriness that succeeded each paroxysm. Similar changes 
occurred during periods of transient hypoxia. Small [K+] decreases in the 
perfusate had the converse effects. Spontaneous SLEs were associated with phasic 
increases in [K+]o. In simultaneous [K+]o recordings from two layers, these 
transients were largest (up to 3.5 mM above base line) and rose more steeply at 
the stratum pyramidale. Toward the outer dendritic layers they became smaller, 
slower in time course, and delayed in onset. We conclude that the main source 
for these [K+]o transients are the hippocampal pyramidal cell bodies, which 
discharge intensely during a SLE, and that excess K+o is spatially dispersed 
around the discharge zone of the paroxysm. [K+]o continued to rise, though at a 
slower rate, throughout the course of a SLE. Following SLE termination, [K+]o 
decayed slowly to base line. The invasion of a CA1 region by a propagating SLE 
was preceded quite often by a slow rise in [K+]o. A sudden transition to a 
steeply rising [K+]o marked the explosive recruitment of this region into the 
discharge zone of the spreading paroxysm. The total (tonic and phasic) increase 
in [K+]o during SLEs did not surpass a maximal level of approximately 9 mM, 
which was the ceiling level of [K+]o in low [Ca2+]o. However, when spreading 
depression occurred, [K+]o rose up to 30-40 mM for several minutes. Spreading 
depression rarely appeared spontaneously despite the recurrence of SLEs, but 
could be provoked by repetitive electrical stimulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT

novel sensory experience lead to spine formation and elimination by a protracted 
process. The extent of spine remodelling correlates with behavioural improvement 
after learning, suggesting a crucial role of synaptic structural plasticity in 
memory formation. Importantly, a small fraction of new spines induced by novel 
experience, together with most spines formed early during development and 
surviving experience-dependent elimination, are preserved and provide a 
structural basis for memory retention throughout the entire life of an animal. 
These studies indicate that learning and daily sensory experience leave minute

mechanism of late long-term potentiation (LTP) is critical for the storage of 
long-term memory, the expression mechanism of synaptic enhancement during 
late-LTP is unknown. The autonomously active protein kinase C isoform, protein 
kinase Mzeta (PKMzeta), is a core molecule maintaining late-LTP. Here we show 
that PKMzeta maintains late-LTP through persistent N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive 
factor (NSF)/glutamate receptor subunit 2 (GluR2)-dependent trafficking of AMPA 
receptors (AMPARs) to the synapse. Intracellular perfusion of PKMzeta into CA1 
pyramidal cells causes potentiation of postsynaptic AMPAR responses; this 
synaptic enhancement is mediated through NSF/GluR2 interactions but not 
vesicle-associated membrane protein-dependent exocytosis. PKMzeta may act 
through NSF to release GluR2-containing receptors from a reserve pool held at 
extrasynaptic sites by protein interacting with C-kinase 1 (PICK1), because 
disrupting GluR2/PICK1 interactions mimic and occlude PKMzeta-mediated AMPAR 
potentiation. During LTP maintenance, PKMzeta directs AMPAR trafficking, as 
measured by NSF/GluR2-dependent increases of GluR2/3-containing receptors in 
synaptosomal fractions from tetanized slices. Blocking this trafficking 
mechanism reverses established late-LTP and persistent potentiation at synapses 
that have undergone synaptic tagging and capture. Thus, PKMzeta maintains 
late-LTP by persistently modifying NSF/GluR2-dependent AMPAR trafficking to 
favor receptor insertion into postsynaptic sites.}, bdsk-url-1  =

the chosen measure. We use a novel Monte Carlo approach to compute a

populations of up to 256 neurons and show that Fisher information can be used to 
accurately estimate both mutual information and SSI for populations of the order 
of 100 neurons, even in the presence of biologically realistic variability, 
noise correlations, and experimentally relevant integration times. According to 
both measures, the stimuli that are best encoded are those falling at the flanks 
of the neuron's tuning curve. In populations of fewer than around 50 neurons, 
however, Fisher information can be misleading.}, institution = {Institute for

  Abstract                 = {Long-term potentiation of synapse strength 
requires enlargement of dendritic spines on cerebral pyramidal neurons. 
Long-term depression is linked to spine shrinkage. Indeed, spines are dynamic 
structures: they form, change their shapes and volumes, or can disappear in the 
space of hours. Do all such changes result from synaptic activity, or do some 
changes result from intrinsic processes? How do enlargement and shrinkage of 
spines relate to elimination and generation of spines, and how do these 
processes contribute to the stationary distribution of spine volumes? To answer 
these questions, we recorded the volumes of many individual spines daily for 
several days using two-photon imaging of CA1 pyramidal neurons in cultured 
slices of rat hippocampus between postnatal days 17 and 23. With normal synaptic 
transmission, spines often changed volume or were created or eliminated, thereby 
showing activity-dependent plasticity. However, we found that spines changed 
volume even after we blocked synaptic activity, reflecting a native instability 
of these small structures over the long term. Such "intrinsic fluctuations" 
showed unique dependence on spine volume. A mathematical model constructed from 
these data and the theory of random fluctuations explains population behaviors 
of spines, such as rates of elimination and generation, stationary distribution 
of volumes, and the long-term persistence of large spines. Our study finds that 
generation and elimination of spines are more prevalent than previously 
believed, and spine volume shows significant correlation with its age and life 
expectancy. The population dynamics of spines also predict key psychological 
features of memory.}, Doi                      =

relies on recurrence is the ring attractor network, which has been used to 
describe phenomena as diverse as working memory, visual processing and head

examine the behaviour of ring attractor networks when the recurrent connections 
are subject to short term synaptic depression, as observed in many brain 
regions. We find that in the presence of a uniform background current, the 
network activity can be in either of three states: a stationary attractor state, 
a uniform state, or a rotating attractor state. The rotation speed can be 
adjusted over a large range by changing the background current, opening the 
possibility to use the network as a variable frequency oscillator or pattern 
generator. Finally, using simulations we extend the network to two-dimensional 
fields and find a rich range of possible behaviours.}, bdsk-url-1  =

retinal locations, seemingly due to the plasticity of intracortical connections. 
We have observed in cats that these shifts occur in a pattern that is highly 
convergent, even among receptive fields that are separated by large distances 
before inactivation. Here we show, using a computational model of primary visual 
cortex, that the observed convergent shifts are inconsistent with the common 
assumption that the underlying intracortical connection plasticity is dependent 
on the temporal correlation of pre- and postsynaptic action potentials. The 
shifts are, however, consistent with the hypothesis that this plasticity is 
dependent on the temporal order of pre- and postsynaptic action potentials. This 
convergent reorganization seems to require increased neuronal gain, revealing a 
mechanism that networks may use to selectively facilitate the didactic transfer 
of neuronal response properties.}, Bdsk-url-1               =

zoonotic pathogen of which several species of animal were reported as 
reservoirs. Swine stands out as the major reservoir for HEV infection in humans, 
as suggested by the close genetic relationship of swine and human virus. Since 
2000, Genotype 4 HEV has become the dominant cause of hepatitis E disease in 
China. Recent reports showed that genotype 4 HEV is freely transmitted between 
humans and swine in eastern and southern China. However, the infection status of 
HEV in human and swine populations in central China is still unclear. This study 
was conducted in a rural area of central China, where there are many commercial 
swine farms. A total of 1476 serum and 554 fecal specimens were collected from 
the general human and swine populations in this area, respectively. The 
seroepidemiological study was conducted by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. 
Conserved genomic sequences of open reading frame 2 were detected using reverse 
transcription-PCR. The results indicated that the overall viral burden of the 
general human subjects was 0.95\% (14/1476), while 7.0\% (39/554) of the swine 
excreted HEV in stool. The positive rate of anti-HEV IgG and IgM in the serum 
samples was 7.9\% (117/1476) and 1.6\% (24/1476), respectively. Phylogenetic 
analysis based on the 150 nt partial sequence of the capsid protein gene showed 
that the 53 swine and human HEV isolates in the current study all belonged to 
genotype 4, clustering into three major groups. However, the HEV isolates 
prevalent in the human and swine populations were classified into known distinct 
subgenotypes, which suggested that no cross-species transmission between swine 
and humans had taken place in this area. This result was confirmed by cloning 
and phylogenetic analysis of the complete capsid protein gene sequence of three 
representative HEV strains in the three major groups. The cross reactivity 
between anti-HEV IgG from human sera and the two representative strains from 
swine in central China was confirmed by Dot-blot assay. In conclusion, although 
all the HEV strains prevalent in central China belonged to genotype 4, there is 
no evidence of cross-species transmission between human and swine in this 
area.}, bdsk-url-1  = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0008156}, doi

essential for the development of the nervous system and may also underlie

increase in dendritic spine density and/or enlargement of spines after the 
induction of long-term potentiation (LTP). Using two-photon time-lapse imaging 
of dendritic spines in acute hippocampal slices from neonatal rats, we found 
that the induction of long-term depression (LTD) by low-frequency stimulation is 
accompanied by a marked shrinkage of spines, which can be reversed by subsequent 
high-frequency stimulation that induces LTP. The spine shrinkage requires 
activation of NMDA receptors and calcineurin, similar to that for LTD. However, 
spine shrinkage is mediated by cofilin, but not by protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), 
which is essential for LTD, suggesting that different downstream pathways are 
involved in spine shrinkage and LTD. This activity-induced spine shrinkage may 
contribute to activity-dependent elimination of synaptic connections.},

  Abstract                 = {The highest stages of the visual ventral pathway 
are commonly assumed to provide robust representation of object identity by 
disregarding confounding factors such as object position, size, illumination, 
and the presence of other objects (clutter). However, whereas neuronal responses 
in monkey inferotemporal cortex (IT) can show robust tolerance to position and 
size changes, previous work shows that responses to preferred objects are 
usually reduced by the presence of nonpreferred objects. More broadly, we do not 
yet understand multiple object representation in IT. In this study, we 
systematically examined IT responses to pairs and triplets of objects in three 
passively viewing monkeys across a broad range of object effectiveness. We found 
that, at least under these limited clutter conditions, a large fraction of the 
response of each IT neuron to multiple objects is reliably predicted as the 
average of its responses to the constituent objects in isolation. That is, 
multiple object responses depend primarily on the relative effectiveness of the 
constituent objects, regardless of object identity. This average effect becomes 
virtually perfect when populations of IT neurons are pooled. Furthermore, the 
average effect cannot simply be explained by attentional shifts but behaves as a 
primarily feedforward response property. Together, our observations are most 
consistent with mechanistic models in which IT neuronal outputs are normalized 
by summed synaptic drive into IT or spiking activity within IT and suggest that 
normalization mechanisms previously revealed at earlier visual areas are 
operating throughout the ventral visual stream.}, Bdsk-url-1               =

  Abstract                 = {Synaptic transmission is a dynamic process. 
Postsynaptic responses wax and wane as presynaptic activity evolves. This 
prominent characteristic of chemical synaptic transmission is a crucial 
determinant of the response properties of synapses and, in turn, of the stimulus 
properties selected by neural networks and of the patterns of activity generated 
by those networks. This review focuses on synaptic changes that result from 
prior activity in the synapse under study, and is restricted to short-term 
effects that last for at most a few minutes. Forms of synaptic enhancement, such 
as facilitation, augmentation, and post-tetanic potentiation, are usually 
attributed to effects of a residual elevation in presynaptic [Ca(2+)]i, acting 
on one or more molecular targets that appear to be distinct from the secretory 
trigger responsible for fast exocytosis and phasic release of transmitter to 
single action potentials. We discuss the evidence for this hypothesis, and the 
origins of the different kinetic phases of synaptic enhancement, as well as the 
interpretation of statistical changes in transmitter release and roles played by 
other factors such as alterations in presynaptic Ca(2+) influx or postsynaptic 
levels of [Ca(2+)]i. Synaptic depression dominates enhancement at many synapses. 
Depression is usually attributed to depletion of some pool of readily releasable 
vesicles, and various forms of the depletion model are discussed. Depression can 
also arise from feedback activation of presynaptic receptors and from 
postsynaptic processes such as receptor desensitization. In addition, 
glial-neuronal interactions can contribute to short-term synaptic plasticity. 
Finally, we summarize the recent literature on putative molecular players in 
synaptic plasticity and the effects of genetic manipulations and other 
modulatory influences.}, Bdsk-url-1               =

which synaptic changes depend on presynaptic spike arrival and the postsynaptic 
membrane potential, filtered with two different time constants. Our model 
describes several nonlinear effects that are observed in STDP experiments, as 
well as the voltage dependence of plasticity. We found that, in a simulated 
recurrent network of spiking neurons, our plasticity rule led not only to 
development of localized receptive fields but also to connectivity patterns that 
reflect the neural code. For temporal coding procedures with spatio-temporal 
input correlations, strong connections were predominantly unidirectional,

only. Thus, variable connectivity patterns in the brain could reflect different

  abstract      = {One of the most critical 
problems we face in the study of biological systems is building accurate 
statistical descriptions of them. This problem has been particularly challenging 
because biological systems typically contain large numbers of interacting 
elements, which precludes the use of standard brute force approaches. Recently, 
though, several groups have reported that there may be an alternate strategy. 
The reports show that reliable statistical models can be built without knowledge 
of all the interactions in a system; instead, pairwise interactions can suffice. 
These findings, however, are based on the analysis of small subsystems. Here, we 
ask whether the observations will generalize to systems of realistic size, that 
is, whether pairwise models will provide reliable descriptions of true 
biological systems. Our results show that, in most cases, they will not. The 
reason is that there is a crossover in the predictive power of pairwise models: 
If the size of the subsystem is below the crossover point, then the results have 
no predictive power for large systems. If the size is above the crossover point, 
then the results may have predictive power. This work thus provides a general 
framework for determining the extent to which pairwise models can be used to 
predict the behavior of large biological systems. Applied to neural data, the 
size of most systems studied so far is below the crossover point.},

networks have so many possible states that exhaustive sampling is impossible. 
Successful analysis thus depends on simplifying hypotheses, but experiments on 
many systems hint that complicated, higher-order interactions among large groups 
of elements have an important role. Here we show, in the vertebrate retina, that 
weak correlations between pairs of neurons coexist with strongly collective 
behaviour in the responses of ten or more neurons. We find that this collective 
behaviour is described quantitatively by models that capture the observed 
pairwise correlations but assume no higher-order interactions. These maximum 
entropy models are equivalent to Ising models, and predict that larger networks 
are completely dominated by correlation effects. This suggests that the neural 
code has associative or error-correcting properties, and we provide preliminary 
evidence for such behaviour. As a first test for the generality of these ideas, 
we show that similar results are obtained from networks of cultured cortical 
neurons.}, bdsk-url-1    = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature04701}, date-added

of the main techniques used to study circuitry is followed by outline 
descriptions of the major classes of neocortical excitatory and inhibitory

subcortical regions. Maps summarizing the projection patterns of each class of 
neurone within the local circuit and tables of the properties of these local 
circuit connections are provided.<br>This review relies primarily on anatomical 
studies that have identified the classes of neurones and their local and long 
distance connections and on paired intracellular and whole-cell recordings which 
have documented the properties of the connections between them. A large number 
of different types of synaptic connections have been described, but for some 
there are only a few published examples and for others the details that can only 
be obtained with paired recordings and dye-filling are lacking. A further 
complication is provided by the range of species, technical approaches and age 
groups used in these studies. Wherever possible the range of available data are 
summarised and compared. To fill some of the more obvious gaps for the less

{Cortical synapses exhibit several forms of short-term plasticity, but the 
contribution of this plasticity to visual response dynamics is unknown. In part, 
this is because the simple patterns of stimulation used to probe plasticity in 
vitro do not correspond to patterns of activity that occur in vivo. We have 
developed a method of quantitatively characterizing short-term plasticity at 
cortical synapses that permits prediction of responses to arbitrary patterns of 
stimulation. Synaptic responses were recorded intracellularly as EPSCs and 
extracellularly as local field potentials in layer 2/3 of rat primary visual 
cortical slices during stimulation of layer 4 with trains of electrical stimuli 
containing random mixtures of frequencies. Responses exhibited complex dynamics 
that were well described by a simple three-component model consisting of 
facilitation and two forms of depression, a stronger form that decayed 
exponentially with a time constant of several hundred milliseconds and a weaker, 
but more persistent, form that decayed with a time constant of several seconds. 
Parameters obtained from fits to one train were used to predict accurately 
responses to other random and constant frequency trains. Control experiments 
revealed that depression was not caused by a decrease in the effectiveness of 
extracellular stimulation or by a buildup of inhibition. Pharmacological 
manipulations of transmitter release and postsynaptic sensitivity suggested that 
both forms of depression are mediated presynaptically. These results indicate 
that firing evoked by visual stimuli is likely to cause significant depression 
at cortical synapses. Hence synaptic depression may be an important determinant 
of the temporal features of visual cortical responses.}, institution =

sympathetic nerves innervating adipose tissue and the increase in lipolysis seen 
during fasting in humans. We used the isotope dilution technique to measure 
regional norepinephrine spillover from abdominal sc adipose tissue from seven

fast with no significant change in total body norepinephrine spillover, forearm 
norepinephrine spillover, epinephrine concentrations, or energy expenditure. We 
show for the first time, in humans, a selective regional increase in adipose

SNS may play a greater role in the regulation of lipid metabolism during fasting

Drosophila specifically disables the costly formation of aversive long-term 
memory (LTM) upon starvation, a physiological state required for appetitive LTM 
formation. At the neural circuit level, the slow oscillations normally triggered 
in two pairs of dopaminergic neurons to enable aversive LTM formation were 
abolished in starved flies. Transient artificial activation of these neurons 
during training restored LTM formation in starved flies but at the price of a 
reduced survival. LTM formation is thus subject to adaptive plasticity that 
helps survival under food shortage.}, doi      = {10.1126/science.1226018}, }

metabolism intervenes in this process. Cellular-resolution imaging of energy 
metabolism reveals a concurrent elevation of energy consumption in neurons of 
the mushroom body, the fly’s major memory centre. Strikingly, upregulation of 
mushroom body energy flux is both necessary and sufficient to drive long-term 
memory formation. This effect is triggered by a specific pair of dopaminergic 
neurons afferent to the mushroom bodies, via the D5-like DAMB dopamine receptor. 
Hence, dopamine signalling mediates an energy switch in the mushroom body that 
controls long-term memory encoding. Our data thus point to an instructional role 
for energy flux in the execution of demanding higher brain functions.}, doi

there were no significant changes in blood pressure, whilst heart rate

beta-hydroxybutyrate rose and plasma lactate did not change. Plasma insulin and 
free triiodothyronine fell during starvation. Plasma adrenaline and

absolute values of blood pressure, forearm blood flow, metabolic rate and plasma 
catecholamines were higher in men than women. Acute starvation produces profound 
cardiovascular and metabolic changes which are not explained by the accompanying 
hormonal changes.}, }

energy metabolism have been under investigation for more than a century. Data 
obtained are conflicting and research has failed to provide conclusive results.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that in lean 
subjects under normal living conditions, short-term starvation leads to an 
increase in serum concentrations of catecholamines and thus to an increase in 
resting energy expenditure.

DESIGN: Resting energy expenditure, measured by indirect calorimetry, and 
hormone and substrate concentrations were measured in 11 healthy, lean subjects 
on days 1, 2, 3, and 4 of an 84-h starvation period.

RESULTS: Resting energy expenditure increased significantly from 3.97 +/- 0.9 
kJ/min on day 1 to 4.53 +/- 0.9 kJ/min on day 3 (P < 0.05). The increase in 
resting energy expenditure was associated with an increase in the norepinephrine 
concentration from 1716. +/- 574 pmol/L on day 1 to 3728 +/- 1636 pmol/L on day 
4 (P < 0.05). Serum glucose decreased from 4.9 +/- 0.5 to 3.5 +/- 0.5 mmol/L (P 
< 0.05), whereas insulin did not change significantly.

CONCLUSIONS: Resting energy expenditure increases in early starvation, 
accompanied by an increase in plasma norepinephrine. This increase in 
norepinephrine seems to be due to a decline in serum glucose and may be the 
initial signal for metabolic changes in early starvation.}, doi      =

are discrete three state synapses and are updated based on a simple field 
dependent Hebbian rule. For testing, the attractor layer is initialized by the 
feedforward inputs and then undergoes asynchronous random updating until 
convergence to a stable state. Classification is indicated by the sub-population 
that is persistently activated. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. This 
is the first example of competitive classification rates of real data being 
achieved through recurrent dynamics in the attractor layer, which is only stable 
if recurrent inhibition is introduced. Second, we demonstrate that employing 
three state synapses with feedforward inhibition is essential for achieving the 
competitive classification rates due to the ability to effectively employ both 
positive and negative informative features.},

were made from pairs of adjacent, synaptically connected thick tufted layer 5 
pyramidal neurones in brain slices of young rat (14-16 days) somatosensory 
cortex to examine the physiological properties of unitary EPSPs. Pre- and 
postsynaptic neurones were filled with biocytin and examined in the light and 
electron microscope to quantify the morphology of axonal and dendritic arbors 
and the number and location of synaptic contacts on the target neurone. 2. In 
138 synaptic connections between pairs of pyramidal neurones 96 (70\%) were 
unidirectional and 42 (30\%) were bidirectional. The probability of finding a 
synaptic connection in dual recordings was 0.1. Unitary EPSPs evoked by a single 
presynaptic action potential (AP) had a mean peak amplitude ranging from 0.15 to 
5.5 mV in different connections with a mean of 1.3 +/- 1.1 mV, a latency of 1.7 
+/- 0.9 ms, a 20-80\% rise time of 2.9 +/- 2.3 ms and a decay time constant of 
40 +/- 18 ms at 32-24 degrees C and -60 +/- 2 mV membrane potential. 3. Peak 
amplitudes of unitary EPSPs fluctuated randomly from trial to trial. The 
coefficient of variation (c.v.) of the unitary EPSP amplitudes ranged from 0.13 
to 2.8 in different synaptic connections (mean, 0.52; median, 0.41). The 
percentage of failures of single APs to evoke a unitary EPSP ranged from 0 to 
73\% (mean, 14\%; median, 7\%). Both c.v. and percentage of failures decreased 
with increasing mean EPSP amplitude. 4. Postsynaptic glutamate receptors which 
mediate unitary EPSPs at -60 mV were predominantly of the 
L-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) receptor type. 
Receptors of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) type contributed only a small 
fraction (< 20\%) to the voltage-time integral of the unitary EPSP at -60 mV, 
but their contribution increased at more positive membrane potentials. 5. 
Branching patterns of dendrites and axon collaterals of forty-five synaptically 
connected neurones, when examined in the light microscope, indicated that the 
axonal and dendritic anatomy of both projecting and target neurones and of uni- 
and bidirectionally connected neurones was uniform. 6. The number of potential 
synaptic contacts formed by a presynaptic neurone on a target neurone varied 
between four and eight (mean, 5.5 +/- 1.1 contacts; n = 19 connections). 
Synaptic contacts were preferentially located on basal dendrites (63\%, 82 +/- 
35 microns from the soma, n = 67) and apical oblique dendrites (27\%, 145 +/- 59 
microns, n = 29), and 35\% of all contacts were located on tertiary basal 
dendritic branches. The mean geometric distances (from the soma) of the contacts 
of a connection varied between 80 and 585 microns (mean, 147 microns; median, 
105 microns). The correlation between EPSP amplitude and the number of 
morphologically determined synaptic contacts or the mean geometric distances 
from the soma was only weak (correlation coefficients were 0.2 and 0.26, 
respectively). 7. Compartmental models constructed from camera lucida drawings 
of eight target neurones showed that synaptic contacts were located at mean 
electrotonic distances between 0.07 and 0.33 from the soma (mean, 0.13). 
Simulations of unitary EPSPs, assuming quantal conductance changes with fast 
rise time and short duration, indicated that amplitudes of quantal EPSPs at the 
soma were attenuated, on average, to < 10\% of dendritic EPSPs and varied in 
amplitude up to 10-fold depending on the dendritic location of synaptic 
contacts. The inferred quantal peak conductance increase varied between 1.5 and 
5.5 nS (mean, 3 nS). 8. The combined physiological and morphological 
measurements in conjunction with EPSP simulations indicated that the 20-fold 
range in efficacy of the synaptic connections between thick tufted pyramidal 
neurones, which have their synaptic contacts preferentially located on basal and 
apical oblique dendrites, was due to differences in transmitter release 
probability of the projecting neurones and, to a lesser extent, to differenc},

that the resulting synaptic connectivity matrix has the following properties: it 
is sparse, with a large fraction of zero synaptic weights (‘potential’ 
synapses); bidirectionally coupled pairs of neurons are over-represented in 
comparison to a random network; and bidirectionally connected pairs have 
stronger synapses on average than unidirectionally connected pairs. All these

asymptotically optimal in the limit of sparse coding. The results appear to

It turns out that the apparent conflict is due to the adoption of different

structures that have a high demand of synaptic plasticity. For example, building 
memories of object positions requires efficient use of plasticity resources 
since objects can easily change their location in space and yet we can memorize 
object locations. But how should a neural circuit ideally be set up to integrate 
two input streams (object location and identity) in case the overall synaptic 
changes should be minimized during ongoing learning? This letter provides a 
theoretical framework on how the two input pathways should ideally be specified. 
Generally the model predicts that the information-rich pathway should be plastic 
and encoded sparsely, whereas the pathway conveying less information should be 
encoded densely and undergo learning only if a neuronal representation of a 
novel object has to be established. As an example, we consider hippocampal area 
CA1, which combines place and object information. The model thereby provides a 
normative account of hippocampal rate remapping, that is, modulations of place 
field activity by changes of local cues. It may as well be applicable to other 
brain areas (such as neocortical layer V) that learn combinatorial codes from 
multiple input streams.}, publisher = {MIT Press}, }

{Evolution of animal morphology, physiology and behaviour is shaped by the 
selective pressures to which they are subject. Some selective pressures act to 
increase the benefits accrued whilst others act to reduce the costs incurred, 
affecting the cost/benefit ratio. Selective pressures therefore produce a 
trade-off between costs and benefits that ultimately influences the fitness of 
the whole organism. The nervous system has a unique position as the interface 
between morphology, physiology and behaviour; the final output of the nervous 
system is the behaviour of the animal, which is a product of both its morphology 
and physiology. The nervous system is under selective pressure to generate 
adaptive behaviour, but at the same time is subject to costs related to the 
amount of energy that it consumes. Characterising this trade-off between costs 
and benefits is essential to understanding the evolution of nervous systems, 
including our own. Within the nervous system, sensory systems are the most 
amenable to analysing costs and benefits, not only because their function can be 
more readily defined than that of many central brain regions and their benefits 
quantified in terms of their performance, but also because recent studies of 
sensory systems have begun to directly assess their energetic costs. Our review 
focuses on the visual system in particular, although the principles we discuss 
are equally applicable throughout the nervous system. Examples are taken from a 
wide range of sensory modalities in both vertebrates and invertebrates. We aim 
to place the studies we review into an evolutionary framework. We combine 
experimentally determined measures of energy consumption from whole retinas of 
rabbits and flies with intracellular measurements of energy consumption from 
single fly photoreceptors and recently constructed energy budgets for neural 
processing in rats to assess the contributions of various components to neuronal 
energy consumption. Taken together, these studies emphasize the high costs of 
maintaining neurons at rest and whilst signalling. A substantial proportion of 
neuronal energy consumption is related to the movements of ions across the 
neuronal cell membrane through ion channels, though other processes such as 
vesicle loading and transmitter recycling also consume energy. Many of the 
energetic costs within neurons are linked to 3Na+/2K+ ATPase activity, which 
consumes energy to pump Na+ and K+ ions across the cell membrane and is 
essential for the maintenance of the resting potential and its restoration 
following signalling. Furthermore, recent studies in fly photoreceptors show 
that energetic costs can be related, via basic biophysical relationships, to 
their function. These findings emphasize that neurons are subject to a law of 
diminishing returns that severely penalizes excess functional capacity with 
increased energetic costs. The high energetic costs associated with neural 
tissue favour energy efficient coding and wiring schemes, which have been found 
in numerous sensory systems. We discuss the role of these efficient schemes in 
reducing the costs of information processing. Assessing evidence from a wide 
range of vertebrate and invertebrate examples, we show that reducing energy 
expenditure can account for many of the morphological features of sensory 
systems and has played a key role in their evolution.}, doi       =

  abstract    = {The initiation and propagation of action potentials 
(APs) places high demands on the energetic resources of neural tissue. Each AP 
forces ATP-driven ion pumps to work harder to restore the ionic concentration 
gradients, thus consuming more energy. Here, we ask whether the ionic currents 
underlying the AP can be predicted theoretically from the principle of minimum 
energy consumption. A long-held supposition that APs are energetically wasteful, 
based on theoretical analysis of the squid giant axon AP, has recently been 
overturned by studies that measured the currents contributing to the AP in 
several mammalian neurons. In the single compartment models studied here, AP 
energy consumption varies greatly among vertebrate and invertebrate neurons, 
with several mammalian neuron models using close to the capacitive minimum of 
energy needed. Strikingly, energy consumption can increase by more than ten-fold 
simply by changing the overlap of the Na(+) and K(+) currents during the AP 
without changing the APs shape. As a consequence, the height and width of the AP 
are poor predictors of energy consumption. In the Hodgkin-Huxley model of the 
squid axon, optimizing the kinetics or number of Na(+) and K(+) channels can 
whittle down the number of ATP molecules needed for each AP by a factor of four. 
In contrast to the squid AP, the temporal profile of the currents underlying APs 
of some mammalian neurons are nearly perfectly matched to the optimized 
properties of ionic conductances so as to minimize the ATP cost.},

  abstract      = {Macaque monkeys were 
tested on a delayed-match-to-multiple-sample task, with either a limited set of 
well trained images (in randomized sequence) or with never-before-seen images. 
They performed much better with novel images. False positives were mostly 
limited to catch-trial image repetitions from the preceding trial. This result 
implies extremely effective one-shot learning, resembling Standing's finding 
that people detect familiarity for 10,000 once-seen pictures (with 80% accuracy) 
(Standing, 1973). Familiarity memory may differ essentially from identification, 
which embeds and generates contextual information. When encountering another 
person, we can say immediately whether his or her face is familiar. However, it 
may be difficult for us to identify the same person. To accompany the 
psychophysical findings, we present a generic neural network model reproducing 
these behaviors, based on the same conservative Hebbian synaptic plasticity that 
generates delay activity identification memory. Familiarity becomes the first 
step toward establishing identification. Adding an inter-trial reset mechanism 
limits false positives for previous-trial images. The model, unlike previous 
proposals, relates repetition--recognition with enhanced neural activity, as 
recently observed experimentally in 92% of differential cells in prefrontal 
cortex, an area directly involved in familiarity recognition. There may be an 
essential functional difference between enhanced responses to novel versus to 
familiar images: The maximal signal from temporal cortex is for novel stimuli, 
facilitating additional sensory processing of newly acquired stimuli. The 
maximal signal for familiar stimuli arising in prefrontal cortex facilitates the

revise the original hypothesis, indicate that the induction of a local,

dissociable. Additional observations suggest that there are major differences in 
the mechanisms of functional and structural plasticity. These advances call for

strengthened than already strong ones. This so called soft-bound plasticity 
automatically constrains the synaptic strengths. It is known that this has 
important consequences for the dynamics of plasticity and the synaptic weight 
distribution, but its impact on information storage is unknown. In this modeling 
study we introduce an information theoretic framework to analyse memory storage 
in an online learning setting. We show that soft-bound plasticity increases a

conditions, social groups such as honeybees might be able to ward off cognitive 
impairments in individual bees by adjusting resource allocation at the colony 
level. Using two complementary experiments, one that tests the effect of 
learning on subsequent energetic state and survival, and another that tests the 
effect of energetic state on learning and retention, we show that individual 
bees pay a significant energetic cost for learning and therefore suffer from 
significant cognitive deficits under energetic stress. We discuss the 
implications of such cognitive impairments for the recent observations of bees 
disappearing from their colonies as well as for social life in general.}, doi

size of a neural circuit influence its learning performance? Larger brains tend 
to be found in species with higher cognitive function and learning ability. 
Intuitively, we expect the learning capacity of a neural circuit to grow with 
the number of neurons and synapses. We show how adding apparently redundant 
neurons and connections to a network can make a task more learnable. 
Consequently, large neural circuits can either devote connectivity to generating 
complex behaviors or exploit this connectivity to achieve faster and more 
precise learning of simpler behaviors. However, we show that in a biologically 
relevant setting where synapses introduce an unavoidable amount of noise, there 
is an optimal size of network for a given task. Above the optimal network size, 
the addition of neurons and synaptic connections starts to impede learning 
performance. This suggests that the size of brain circuits may be constrained by 
the need to learn efficiently with unreliable synapses and provides a hypothesis 
for why some neurological learning deficits are associated with 
hyperconnectivity. Our analysis is independent of specific learning rules and 
uncovers fundamental relationships between learning rate, task performance, 
network size, and intrinsic noise in neural circuits.}, doi      =

is non-local. For novel information and motivational events such as rewards this

Here we show that fast Na+ current decay and delayed K+ current onset during 
action potentials in nonmyelinated mossy fibers of the rat hippocampus minimize 
the overlap of their respective ion fluxes. This results in total Na+ influx and 
associated energy demand per action potential of only 1.3 times the theoretical 
minimum, in contrast to the factor of 4 used in previous energy budget 
calculations for neural activity. Analysis of ionic conductance parameters 
revealed that the properties of Na+ and K+ channels are matched to make axonal 
action potentials energy-efficient, minimizing their contribution to 
activity-dependent metabolism.},

anaesthetized cats and area IT of awake macaque monkeys, responses of neurons to 
videos of natural scenes. Responses were analysed to test various hypotheses 
concerning the nature of neural coding in these two regions. A variety of 
spike-train statistics were measured including spike-count distributions, 
interspike interval distributions, coefficients of variation, power spectra, 
Fano factors and different sparseness measures. All statistics showed 
non-Poisson characteristics and several revealed self-similarity of the spike 
trains. Spike-count distributions were approximately exponential in both visual 
areas for eight different videos and for counting windows ranging from 50 ms to 
5 seconds. The results suggest that the neurons maximize their information 
carrying capacity while maintaining a fixed long-term-average firing rate, or 
equivalently, minimize their average firing rate for a fixed information 
carrying capacity.},

  abstract      = {Recent experimental studies indicate that synaptic 
changes induced by neuronal activity are discrete jumps between a small number 
of stable states. Learning in systems with discrete synapses is known to be a 
computationally hard problem. Here, we study a neurobiologically plausible 
on-line learning algorithm that derives from belief propagation algorithms. We 
show that it performs remarkably well in a model neuron with binary synapses, 
and a finite number of ``hidden''states per synapse, that has to learn a random 
classification task. Such a system is able to learn a number of associations 
close to the theoretical limit in time that is sublinear in system size. This is 
to our knowledge the first on-line algorithm that is able to achieve efficiently 
a finite number of patterns learned per binary synapse. Furthermore, we show 
that performance is optimal for a finite number of hidden states that becomes 
very small for sparse coding. The algorithm is similar to the standard 
``perceptron''learning algorithm, with an additional rule for synaptic 
transitions that occur only if a currently presented pattern is ``barely 
correct.''In this case, the synaptic changes are metaplastic only (change in 
hidden states and not in actual synaptic state), stabilizing the synapse in its 
current state. Finally, we show that a system with two visible states and K 
hidden states is much more robust to noise than a system with K visible states. 
We suggest that this rule is sufficiently simple to be easily implemented by 
neurobiological systems or in hardware.},

  abstract    = {Recent data indicate that plasticity protocols 
have not only synapse-specific but also more widespread effects. In particular, 
in synaptic tagging and capture (STC), tagged synapses can capture 
plasticity-related proteins, synthesized in response to strong stimulation of 
other synapses. This leads to long-lasting modification of only weakly 
stimulated synapses. Here we present a biophysical model of synaptic plasticity 
in the hippocampus that incorporates several key results from experiments on 
STC. The model specifies a set of physical states in which a synapse can exist, 
together with transition rates that are affected by high- and low-frequency 
stimulation protocols. In contrast to most standard plasticity models, the model 
exhibits both early- and late-phase LTP/D, de-potentiation, and STC. As such, it 
provides a useful starting point for further theoretical work on the role of STC 
in learning and memory.},

Drosophila melanogaster has a dedicated mechanism for forgetting: blocking the 
G-protein Rac leads to slower and activating Rac to faster forgetting. This 
active form of forgetting lacks a satisfactory functional explanation. We 
investigated optimal decision making for an agent adapting to a stochastic 
environment where a stimulus may switch between being indicative of reward or 
punishment. Like Drosophila, an optimal agent shows forgetting with a rate that 
is linked to the time scale of changes in the environment. Moreover, to reduce 
the odds of missing future reward, an optimal agent may trade the risk of 
immediate pain for information gain and thus forget faster after aversive 
conditioning. A simple neuronal network reproduces these features. Our theory 
shows that forgetting in Drosophila appears as an optimal adaptive behavior in a 
changing environment. This is in line with the view that forgetting is adaptive 
rather than a consequence of limitations of the memory system.},

several methods for decomposition have been proposed, including the Method of 
Frames (MOF), Matching Pursuit (MP), and, for special dictionaries, the Best 
Orthogonal Basis (BOB). Basis Pursuit (BP) is a principle for decomposing a 
signal into an &quot;optimal&quot; superposition of dictionary elements, where 
optimal means having the smallest l 1 norm of coefficients among all such 
decompositions. We give examples exhibiting several advantages over MOF, MP! and 
BOB, including better sparsity, and super-resolution. BP has interesting 
relations to ideas in areas as diverse as ill-posed problems, in abstract 
harmonic analysis, total variation de-noising, and multi-scale edge de-noising.

properties of neuronal networks have been extensively studied using methods from 
statistical physics. However, most of these studies ignore a fundamental 
constraint in networks of real neurons: synapses are either excitatory or 
inhibitory, and cannot change sign during learning. Here, we characterize the 
optimal storage properties of an analog perceptron with excitatory synapses, as 
a simplified model for cerebellar Purkinje cells. The information storage 
capacity is shown to be optimized when inputs have a sparse binary distribution, 
while the weight distribution at maximal capacity consists of a large amount of 
zero-weight synapses. Both features are in agreement with electrophysiological 
data.</p>},

one of the main brain structures involved in motor learning. Classical theories 
of cerebellar function assign a crucial role to Purkinje cells (PCs), that are 
assumed to perform as simple perceptrons. In these theories, PCs should learn to 
provide an appropriate motor output, given a particular input, encoded by the 
granule cell (GC) network. This learning is assumed to occur through 
modifications of <inline-formula><inline-graphic

climbing fiber input to PCs, which is supposed to carry an error signal. In this 
paper, we compute storage capacity and distribution of weights in the presence 
of temporal correlations in inputs and outputs, which are unavoidable in sensory 
inputs and motor outputs. Furthermore, we study how bistability in the PCs 
affects capacity and distribution of weights. We find that (1) capacity 
increases monotonically with both input and output correlations; (2) bistability 
increases storage capacity, when the output correlation is larger than the input 
correlation; (3) the distribution of weights at maximal capacity is independent

slices in vitro to compare two accounts of the mechanisms by which 
input-specific protein synthesis-dependent long-term potentiation (late-LTP) may 
be realised. The synaptic tag hypothesis (Frey and Morris, 1997) predicts that 
the expression of early-LTP following a weak tetanus can be stabilised into 
late-LTP by subsequent strong tetanisation of a separate pathway, provided the 
interval between the two tetanisation episodes is within the decay time-course 
of a putative synaptic tag. An alternative plasticity-factors hypothesis 
requires that strong tetanisation should always precede weak tetanisation for 
stabilisation of early-LTP to occur. Our results indicate that weak tetanisation 
of pathway S2 at intervals of 5 min or 1 h prior to strong tetanisation on 
pathway S1 does result in late-LTP on pathway S2. Stabilisation was weaker or 
did not occur at intervals of 2 and 4 h. This stabilisation effect was shown to 
depend on protein synthesis during the strong tetanisation of S1. These findings 
uphold a key prediction of the synaptic tag hypothesis and have implications for 
the functional role of synaptic tagging for cortical plasticity.},

  abstract    = {A novel property of hippocampal LTP, 'variable 
persistence', has recently been described that is, we argue, relevant to the 
role of LTP in information storage. Specifically, new results indicate that a 
particular pattern of synaptic activation can give rise, either to a relatively 
short-lasting LTP, or to a longer-lasting LTP as a function of the history of 
activation of the neuron. This has led to the idea that the induction of LTP is 
associated with the setting of a'synaptic tag' at activated synapses, whose role 
is to sequester plasticity-related proteins that then serve to stabilize 
temporary synaptic changes and so extend their persistence. In this article, we 
outline the synaptic tag hypothesis, compare predictions it makes with those of 
other theories about the persistence of LTP, and speculate about the cellular 
identity of the tag. In addition, we outline the requirement for aminergic 
activation to induce late LTP and consider the functional implications of the 
synaptic tag hypothesis with respect to long-term memory.},

  abstract    = {Repeated stimulation of hippocampal neurons can 
induce an immediate and prolonged increase in synaptic strength that is called 
long-term potentiation (LTP)-the primary cellular model of memory in the 
mammalian brain. An early phase of LTP (lasting less than three hours) can be 
dissociated from late-phase LTP by using inhibitors of transcription and 
translation, Because protein synthesis occurs mainly in the cell body, whereas 
LTP is input-specific, the question arises of how the synapse specificity of 
late LTP is achieved without elaborate intracellular protein trafficking. We 
propose that LTP initiates the creation of a short-lasting 
protein-synthesis-independent 'synaptic tag' at the potentiated synapse which 
sequesters the relevant protein(s) to establish late LTP. In support of this 
idea, we now show that weak tetanic stimulation, which ordinarily leads only to 
early LTP, or repeated tetanization in the presence of protein-synthesis 
inhibitors, each results in protein-synthesis-dependent late LTP, provided 
repeated tetanization has already been applied at another input to the same 
population of neurons. The synaptic tag decays in less than three hours. These 
findings indicate that the persistence of LTP depends not only on local events 
during its induction, but also on the prior activity of the neuron.},

requires a high degree of plasticity, but retaining these memories demands 
protection against changes induced by further activity and experience. Models in 
which memories are stored through switch-like transitions in synaptic efficacy 
are good at storing but bad at retaining memories if these transitions are 
likely, and they are poor at storage but good at retention if they are unlikely. 
We construct and study a model in which each synapse has a cascade of states 
with different levels of plasticity, connected by metaplastic transitions. This 
cascade model combines high levels of memory storage with long retention times 
and significantly outperforms alternative models. As a result, we suggest that 
memory storage requires synapses with multiple states exhibiting dynamics over a 
wide range of timescales, and we suggest experimental tests of this 
hypothesis.},

  abstract    = {During sleep, neural activity in the hippocampus 
and neocortex seems to recapitulate aspects of its earlier, awake form. This 
replay may be a substrate for the consolidation of long-term declarative 
memories, whereby they become independent of the hippocampus and are stored in 
neocortex. In contrast to storage, other crucial facets of competent long-term 
memory, such as maintenance of access to stored traces and preservation of their 
correct interpretation, have received little attention. We investigate long-term 
episodic and semantic memory in a theoretical model of neocortical-hippocampal 
interaction. We find that, in the absence of regular hippocampal reactivation, 
even supposedly consolidated episodic memories are fragile in the face of 
cortical semantic plasticity. Replay allows access to episodes stored in the 
hippocampus to be maintained, by keeping them in appropriate register with 
changing neocortical representations. Hippocampal storage and replay also has a 
constructive role in the recall of structured, semantic information.},

of the learning, is found at the maximum storage capacity of a model with only 
positive or randomly distributed signs. For the case of infinitely many neurons, 
a replica symmetric calculation of the free energy and the distribution of 
coupling strengths is presented. The linear algorithm is also applied to 
networks with a more suitable choice of sign constraints, with the result of a 
higher storage capacity.},

  abstract    = {Long-term potentiation (LTP) has been studied 
extensively at CA1 synapses of the hippocampus, and there is evidence 
implicating both postsynaptic and presynaptic changes in this process. These 
changes include (i) addition of AMPA channels to the extrasynaptic membrane and 
diffusional equilibrium of extrasynaptic receptors with synaptic receptors, (ii) 
sudden addition of AMPA channels to the synapse in large groups, (iii) a change 
in the mode of glutamate release (presumably from kiss-and-run to full fusion), 
and (iv) a delayed increase in the number of vesicles released. However, it 
remains unclear whether (or how) these changes work together. We have 
incorporated all of these processes into a structural model of the synapse. We 
propose that the synapse is composed of transsynaptic modules that function 
quasi-independently in AMPA-mediated transmission. Under basal conditions, 
synapses are partially silent; some modules are AMPA-silent (but contribute to 
NMDA-mediated transmission), whereas others are functional (and contribute to 
both AMPA- and NMDA-mediated transmission). During LTP, there is both a rapid 
change in the mode of vesicle fusion and a rapid insertion of a postsynaptic 
complex (a hyperslot) containing many proteins (slots) capable of binding AMPA 
channels. The combined effect of these pre- and postsynaptic changes is to 
convert AMPA-silent modules into functional modules. Slot filling is transiently 
enhanced by a rapid increase in extrasynaptic GluR1, a form of the AMPA-type 
receptor. A slower transsynaptic growth process adds AMPA-silent modules to the 
synapse, enhancing the number of vesicles released and thereby enhancing the 
NMDA response. This model accounts for a broad range of data, including the 
LTP-induced changes in quantal parameters. The model also provides a coherent 
explanation for the diverse effects of GluR1 knockout on basal transmission, 
LTP, and distance-dependent scaling.},

that an increase in the synaptic response, induced by pairing action-potential 
activity in pre- and postsynaptic neurons, was only observed when synaptic input 
occurred at low frequencies. This frequency-dependent increase in synaptic 
responses arises because of a redistribution of the available synaptic efficacy 
and not because of an increase in the efficacy. Redistribution of synaptic 
efficacy could represent a mechanism to change the content, rather than the 
gain, of signals conveyed between neurons.},

neural network supplied with spatially organized data. This inner structure is 
taken into account by a matrix C ij , whose coefficients equal the average 
correlation between two pixels i and j of the input patterns. The storage 
capacity alpha is computed as a function of the required stability and of the 
eigenvalues of C. The author proposes a geometrical transformation allowing an 
intuitive interpretation of these results. Numerical simulations using real and 
binary patterns show a very good agreement with the theory. Finally, the author 
analyses the synaptic couplings correlations resulting from the training of the 
network with structured patterns. Focusing on exponentially decreasing 
correlations one and two dimensions, the author finds that they exhibit a 
'Mexican hat' profile, the excitatory centre size of which depends on alpha .},

activity in neurones are now an established aspect of physiology and rest on a 
large body of experimental evidence that points to roles in development, 
learning and memory, and disease. However, the concepts underlying homeostasis 
are too often summarized in ways that restrict their explanatory power and 
obviate important subtleties. Here, we present a review of the underlying theory 
of homeostasis--control theory--in an attempt to reconcile some existing 
conceptual problems in the context of neuronal physiology. In addition to 
clarifying the underlying theory, this review highlights the remaining 
challenges posed when analysing homeostatic phenomena that underlie the 
regulation of neuronal excitability. Moreover, we suggest approaches for future 
experimental and computational work that will further our understanding of 
neuronal homeostasis and the fundamental neurophysiological functions it 
serves.},

  abstract    = {Classical experiments on spike timing-dependent 
plasticity (STDP) use a protocol based on pairs of presynaptic and postsynaptic 
spikes repeated at a given frequency to induce synaptic potentiation or 
depression. Therefore, standard STDP models have expressed the weight change as 
a function of pairs of presynaptic and postsynaptic spike. Unfortunately, those 
paired-based STDP models cannot account for the dependence on the repetition 
frequency of the pairs of spike. Moreover, those STDP models cannot reproduce 
recent triplet and quadruplet experiments. Here, we examine a triplet rule 
(i.e., a rule which considers sets of three spikes, i.e., two pre and one post 
or one pre and two post) and compare it to classical pair-based STDP learning 
rules. With such a triplet rule, it is possible to fit experimental data from 
visual cortical slices as well as from hippocampal cultures. Moreover, when 
assuming stochastic spike trains, the triplet learning rule can be mapped to a 
Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro learning rule.},

  abstract      = {<p>Neuronal circuits modify their response to 
synaptic inputs in an experience-dependent fashion. Increases in synaptic 
weights are accompanied by structural modifications, and activity dependent, 
long lasting growth of dendritic spines requires new protein synthesis. When 
multiple spines are potentiated within a dendritic domain, they show dynamic 
structural plasticity changes, indicating that spines can undergo bidirectional 
physical modifications. However, it is unclear whether protein synthesis 
dependent synaptic depression leads to long lasting structural changes. Here, we 
investigate the structural correlates of protein synthesis dependent long-term 
depression (LTD) mediated by metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) through 
two-photon imaging of dendritic spines on hippocampal pyramidal neurons. We find 
that induction of mGluR-LTD leads to robust and long lasting spine shrinkage and 
elimination that lasts for up to 24 hours. These effects depend on signaling 
through group I mGluRs, require protein synthesis, and activity. These data 
reveal a mechanism for long lasting remodeling of synaptic inputs, and offer 
potential insights into mental retardation.</p>},

  abstract    = {Many 
of the cognitive deficits of normal ageing (forgetfulness, distractibility, 
inflexibility and impaired executive functions) involve prefrontal cortex (PFC) 
dysfunction. The PFC guides behaviour and thought using working memory, which 
are essential functions in the information age. Many PFC neurons hold 
information in working memory through excitatory networks that can maintain 
persistent neuronal firing in the absence of external stimulation. This fragile 
process is highly dependent on the neurochemical environment. For example, 
elevated cyclic-AMP signalling reduces persistent firing by opening HCN and KCNQ 
potassium channels. It is not known if molecular changes associated with normal 
ageing alter the physiological properties of PFC neurons during working memory, 
as there have been no in vivo recordings, to our knowledge, from PFC neurons of 
aged monkeys. Here we characterize the first recordings of this kind, revealing 
a marked loss of PFC persistent firing with advancing age that can be rescued by 
restoring an optimal neurochemical environment. Recordings showed an age-related 
decline in the firing rate of DELAY neurons, whereas the firing of CUE neurons 
remained unchanged with age. The memory-related firing of aged DELAY neurons was 
partially restored to more youthful levels by inhibiting cAMP signalling, or by 
blocking HCN or KCNQ channels. These findings reveal the cellular basis of 
age-related cognitive decline in dorsolateral PFC, and demonstrate that 
physiological integrity can be rescued by addressing the molecular needs of PFC 
circuits.},

functioning of the brain, we still do not understand how the code used in 
signaling depends on the properties of synaptic transmission. Theoretical 
analysis combined with patch clamp recordings from pairs of neocortical 
pyramidal neurons revealed that the rate of synaptic depression, which depends 
on the probability of neurotransmitter release, dictates the extent to which 
firing rate and temporal coherence of action potentials within a presynaptic 
population are signaled to the postsynaptic neuron. The postsynaptic response 
primarily reflects rates of firing when depression is slow and temporal 
coherence when depression is fast. A wide range of rates of synaptic depression 
between different pairs of pyramidal neurons was found, suggesting that the 
relative contribution of rate and temporal signals varies along a continuum. We 
conclude that by setting the rate of synaptic depression, release probability is 
an important factor in determining the neural code.},

show that, in the presence of lateral connections between developing orientation 
cells, these cells self-organize into banded patterns of cells of similar 
orientation. These patterns are similar to the "orientation columns" found in 
mammalian visual cortex. No orientation preference is specified to the system at 
any stage, none of the basic developmental rules is specific to visual

sensory neurons govern both the amount of stimulus information conveyed and the 
means by which downstream neurons can extract it. Although a variety of 
measurements indicate the existence of such dependencies, their origin and 
importance for neural coding are poorly understood. Here we analyse the 
functional significance of correlated firing in a complete population of macaque 
parasol retinal ganglion cells using a model of multi-neuron spike responses. 
The model, with parameters fit directly to physiological data, simultaneously 
captures both the stimulus dependence and detailed spatio-temporal correlations 
in population responses, and provides two insights into the structure of the 
neural code. First, neural encoding at the population level is less noisy than 
one would expect from the variability of individual neurons: spike times are 
more precise, and can be predicted more accurately when the spiking of 
neighbouring neurons is taken into account. Second, correlations provide 
additional sensory information: optimal, model-based decoding that exploits the 
response correlation structure extracts 20\% more information about the visual 
scene than decoding under the assumption of independence, and preserves 40\% 
more visual information than optimal linear decoding. This model-based approach 
reveals the role of correlated activity in the retinal coding of visual stimuli, 
and provides a general framework for understanding the importance of correlated 
activity in populations of neurons.},

biologically plausible multiplicative model, the synapses in asynchronous

their synchrony.},

  abstract    = {We propose that blood glucose is 
regulated by a principle which we call integral rein control, in which under 
most conditions both glucagon and insulin are produced and control is achieved 
by altering the balance between the two. Like other integral control systems, 
the mechanism achieves zero steady-state error, which explains how the blood 
glucose level can remain very nearly constant over a wide range of input and 
demand. In addition, the use of two hormones makes the system stable against 
relatively large perturbations in either direction. An important feature of the 
model is that the set point is not fixed by an external reference but arises out 
of the dynamics, in particular out of the relation between the rates of 
production of the two hormones. The model therefore predicts that the 
consequence of an inability to produce insulin will be not just that the control 
will be less effective but that the set point will be shifted. This allows us to 
explain why patients with untreated Type I diabetes mellitus have high blood 
glucose levels even under conditions of low glucose input, and why it is 
difficult to maintain the normal level of 5 mmol/1 in patients who are being 
treated with insulin. It also explains why Type II diabetes is easier to 
treat.},

by Laurence Abbott Parameter Extraction from Population Codes: A Critical 
Assessment Herman P. Snippe' University of Stirling, Department of Psychology, 
Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland U.K. In perceptual systems, a stimulus parameter can 
be extracted by de- termining the center-of-gravity of the response profile of a 
popula- tion of neural sensors. Likewise at the motor end of a neural system, 
center-of-gravity decoding, also known as vector decoding, generates a movement 
direction from the neural activation profile. We evalu- ate these schemes from a 
statistical perspective, by comparing their statistical variance with the 
minimum variance possible for an unbi- ased parameter extraction from the noisy 
neuronal ensemble activation profile. Center-of-gravity decoding can be 
statistically optimal. This is the case for regular arrays of sensors with 
gaussian tuning profiles that have an output described by Poisson statistics, 
and for arrays of sensors with a sinusoidal tuning profile for the (angular) 
parameter es- timated. However, there are also many cases in which 
center-of-gravity decoding is highly inefficient. This includes the important 
case where sensor positions are very irregular. Finally, we study the robustness 
of center-of-gravity decoding against response nonlinearities at differ- ent 
stages of an information processing hierarchy. We conclude that, in neural 
systems, instead of representing a parameter explicitly, it is safer to leave 
the parameter coded implicitly in a neuronal ensemble activation profile. 1 
Introduction Structure can be coded in many ways. We briefly discuss three 
coding systems for a parameter a. More possibilities, e.g., based on the 
temporal characteristics of the neural response, certainly exist (e.g., Geisler 
ef aI. 1991; Hopfield 1995; Konig et aI. 1995; Middlebrooks ef al. 1994; Oram 
and Perrett 1992). 1. Make a sensor that has a response strength R that grows 
monoton- ically with a: R = R(a). In the most simple case the function R(a)

inhomogeneities present in synapses and neurons affect the performance of 
feedforward associative memories with linear learning, a high-level network 
model of hippocampal circuitry and plasticity. The inhomogeneities incorporated 
into the model are differential input attenuation, stochastic synaptic 
transmission, and memories learned with varying intensity. For a class of local 
learning rules, we determine the memory capacity of the model by extending 
previous analysis. We find that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), a measure of 
fidelity of recall, depends on the coefficients of variation (CVs) of the 
attenuation factors, the transmission variables, and the intensity of the 
memories, as well as the parameters of the learning rule, pattern sparsity and 
the number of memories stored. To predict the effects of attenuation due to 
extended dendritic trees, we use distributions of attenuations appropriate to 
unbranched and branched dendritic trees. Biological parameters for stochastic 
transmission are used to determine the CV of the transmission factors. The 
reduction in SNR due to differential attenuation is surprisingly low compared to 
the reduction due to stochastic transmission. Training a network by storing 
memories at different intensities is equivalent to using a learning rule 
incorporating weight decay. In this type of network, new memories can be stored 
continuously at the expense of older ones being forgotten (a palimpsest). We 
show that there is an optimal rate of weight decay that maximizes the capacity 
of the network, which is a factor of e lower than its nonpalimpsest 
equivalent.},

threshold gate) is commonly used as a simplified model for the discrimination 
and learning capability of a biological neuron. Criteria that tell us when a 
perceptron can implement (or learn to implement) all possible dichotomies over a 
given set of input patterns are well known, but only for the idealized case, 
where one assumes that the sign of a synaptic weight can be switched during 
learning. We present in this letter an analysis of the classification capability 
of the biologically more realistic model of a sign-constrained perceptron, where 
the signs of synaptic weights remain fixed during learning (which is the case 
for most types of biological synapses). In particular, the VC-dimension of 
sign-constrained perceptrons is determined, and a necessary and sufficient 
criterion is provided that tells us when all 2(m) dichotomies over a given set 
of m patterns can be learned by a sign-constrained perceptron. We also show that 
uniformity of L(1) norms of input patterns is a sufficient condition for full 
representation power in the case where all weights are required to be 
nonnegative. Finally, we exhibit cases where the sign constraint of a perceptron 
drastically reduces its classification capability. Our theoretical analysis is 
complemented by computer simulations, which demonstrate in particular that

long-term synaptic changes. There is, however, no general agreement on the 
computational role of this interaction. Here, we derive a learning rule for the 
release probability and the maximal synaptic conductance in a circuit model with 
combined recurrent and feedforward connections that allows learning to 
discriminate among natural inputs. Short-term synaptic plasticity thereby 
provides a nonlinear expansion of the input space of a linear classifier, 
whereas the random recurrent network serves to decorrelate the expanded input 
space. Computer simulations reveal that the twofold increase in the number of 
input dimensions through short-term synaptic plasticity improves the performance 
of a standard perceptron up to 100\%. The distributions of release probabilities 
and maximal synaptic conductances at the capacity limit strongly depend on the 
balance between excitation and inhibition. The model also suggests a new 
computational interpretation of spikes evoked by stimuli outside the classical 
receptive field. These neuronal activities may reflect decorrelation of the 
expanded stimulus space by intracortical synaptic connections.},

suggested to keep memories from being overwritten too rapidly while preserving 
receptiveness to new contents: either introducing synaptic meta levels that 
store the history of synaptic state changes or reducing the number of 
synchronously active neurons, which decreases interference. We find that 
synaptic metaplasticity indeed can prolong memory lifetimes but only under the 
restriction that the neuronal population code is not too sparse. For sparse 
codes, metaplasticity may actually hinder memory longevity. This is important 
because in memory-related brain regions as the hippocampus population codes are 
sparse. Comparing 2 different synaptic cascade models with binary weights, we 
find that a serial topology of synaptic state transitions gives rise to larger 
memory capacities than a model with cross transitions. For the serial model, 
memory capacity is virtually independent of network size and connectivity.},

Summary</title> <p>It is believed that the neural basis of learning and memory 
is change in the strength of synaptic connections between neurons. Much 
theoretical work on this topic assumes that the strength, or weight, of a 
synapse may vary continuously and be unbounded. More recent studies have 
considered synapses that have a limited number of discrete states. In dynamical 
models of such synapses, old memories are automatically overwritten by new 
memories, and it has been previously difficult to optimize performance using 
standard capacity measures, for stronger learning typically implies faster 
forgetting. Here, we propose an information theoretic measure of storage 
capacity of such forgetting systems, and use this to optimize the learning 
rules. We find that for parameters comparable to those found in biology, 
capacity of discrete synapses is similar to that of unbounded, continuous 
synapses, provided the number of synapses per neuron is limited. Our findings 
are relevant for experiments investigating the precise nature of synaptic 
changes during learning, and also pave a path for further work on building 
biologically realistic memory models.</p>},

  abstract      = {We study unsupervised Hebbian 
learning in a recurrent network in which synapses have a finite number of stable 
states. Stimuli received by the network are drawn at random at each presentation 
from a set of classes. Each class is defined as a cluster in stimulus space, 
centred on the class prototype. The presentation protocol is chosen to mimic the 
protocols of visual memory experiments in which a set of stimuli is presented 
repeatedly in a random way. The statistics of the input stream may be 
stationary, or changing. Each stimulus induces, in a stochastic way, transitions 
between stable synaptic states. Learning dynamics is studied analytically in the 
slow learning limit, in which a given stimulus has to be presented many times 
before it is memorized, i.e. before synaptic modifications enable a pattern of 
activity correlated with the stimulus to become an attractor of the recurrent 
network. We show that in this limit the synaptic matrix becomes more correlated 
with the class prototypes than with any of the instances of the class. We also 
show that the number of classes that can be learned increases sharply when the 
coding level decreases, and determine the speeds of learning and forgetting of 
classes in the case of changes in the statistics of the input stream.},

more elaborate biological machinery and slower learning.},

of recognition without the ability to recall when or where the stimulus has been 
encountered before. This sense of recognition is called familiarity memory. 
Following previous computational studies of familiarity memory, we investigate 
the dynamical properties of familiarity discrimination and contrast two 
different familiarity discriminators: one based on the energy of the neural 
network and the other based on the time derivative of the energy. We show how 
the familiarity signal decays rapidly after stimulus presentation. For both 
discriminators, we calculate the capacity using mean field analysis. Compared to 
recall capacity (the classical associative memory in Hopfield nets), both the 
energy and the slope discriminators have bigger capacity, yet the energy-based 
discriminator has a higher capacity than one based on its time derivative. 
Finally, both discriminators are found to have a different noise dependence.},

patterns of synaptic connectivity are rapidly overwritten and destroyed by 
ongoing plasticity related to the storage of new memories. Short memory 
lifetimes arise from the bounds that must be imposed on synaptic efficacy in any 
realistic model. We explored whether memory performance can be improved by 
allowing synapses to traverse a large number of states before reaching their 
bounds, or by changing the way these bounds are imposed. In the case of hard 
bounds, memory lifetimes grow proportional to the square of the number of 
synaptic states, but only if potentiation and depression are precisely balanced. 
Improved performance can be obtained without fine tuning by imposing soft 
bounds, but this improvement is only linear with respect to the number of 
synaptic states. We explored several other possibilities and conclude that 
improving memory performance requires a more radical modification of the 
standard model of memory storage.},

  abstract      = {It is widely believed that synaptic modifications underlie 
learning and memory. However, few studies have examined what can be deduced 
about the learning process from the distribution of synaptic weights. We analyze 
the perceptron, a prototypical feedforward neural network, and obtain the 
optimal synaptic weight distribution for a perceptron with excitatory synapses. 
It contains more than 50\% silent synapses, and this fraction increases with 
storage reliability: silent synapses are therefore a necessary byproduct of 
optimizing learning and reliability. Exploiting the classical analogy between 
the perceptron and the cerebellar Purkinje cell, we fitted the optimal weight 
distribution to that measured for granule cell-Purkinje cell synapses. The two 
distributions agreed well, suggesting that the Purkinje cell can learn up to 5 
kilobytes of information, in the form of 40,000 input-output associations.},

consolidated associative memory are known in Drosophila: long-term memory and 
so-called anesthesia-resistant memory. Long-term memory is more stable, but 
unlike anesthesia-resistant memory, its formation requires protein synthesis. We 
show that flies induced to form long-term memory become more susceptible to 
extreme stress (such as desiccation). In contrast, induction of 
anesthesia-resistant memory had no detectable effect on desiccation resistance. 
This finding may help to explain why evolution has maintained 
anesthesia-resistant memory as another form of consolidated memory, distinct 
from long-term memory.},

the energy expenditure on different components of excitatory signaling in the 
grey matter of rodent brain. Action potentials and postsynaptic effects of 
glutamate are predicted to consume much of the energy (47\% and 34\%, 
respectively), with the resting potential consuming a smaller amount (13\%), and 
glutamate recycling using only 3\%. Energy usage depends strongly on action 
potential rate--an increase in activity of 1 action potential/cortical neuron/s 
will raise oxygen consumption by 145 mL/100 g grey matter/h. The energy expended 
on signaling is a large fraction of the total energy used by the brain; this 
favors the use of energy efficient neural codes and wiring patterns. Our 
estimates of energy usage predict the use of distributed codes, with <or=15\% of 
neurons simultaneously active, to reduce energy consumption and allow greater 
computing power from a fixed number of neurons. Functional magnetic resonance 
imaging signals are likely to be dominated by changes in energy usage associated 
with synaptic currents and action potential propagation.},

  year         = {2020},
  abstract     = {In white fat adipocytes voltage-gated Ca2+ channels are constitutively active. Since the adipocyte membrane potential (Vm) is controlled by Cl- we investigated if changes in [Cl-]o can affect the activity of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and intracellular calcium, [Ca2+]i. Adipocytes were isolated from epididymal fat of CD-1 mice. [Ca2+]i was imaged with epifluorescent microscopy at 28{\textdegree}C. Constitutive voltage-gated channel activity was confirmed by the ability of verapamil to decrease [Ca2+]i. Substitution of [Cl-]o to 113, 53 and 18 mM with the membrane impermeant gluconate anion decreased [Ca2+]i from 114{\textpm}8.7 to 106{\textpm}7.5, 101{\textpm}7.1 and 97{\textpm}6 nM respectively. Substitution of [Cl-]o with glutamate mimicked the ability of gluconate to decrease [Ca2+]i. To explore if anions affected [Ca2+]i via chelation of external Ca2+, [Ca2+]o was analyzed by potentiometry. Gluconate, glutamate, aspartate and methylsulphonate had Ca2+ association constants of 17{\textpm}1.8, 12{\textpm}1, 8.2{\textpm}4.1 and 3.3{\textpm}0.5 L- M respectively. Substitution of 134 mM [Cl-]o with gluconate decreased [Ca2+]oi from 2.6 mM to 200 Î¼M ; the effect of this anion on [Ca2+]i was mimicked by a decrease of [Ca2+]o to 200 Î¼M in standard [Cl-]o solution. Conversely, titration of [Ca2+]o from 200 Î¼M back to 2.6 mM in 134 mM gluconate solutions abolished the effect of this anion on [Ca2+]i. Substitution of [Cl-]o with methylsulphonate to affect Vm did not affect [Ca2+]i. Whereas, growth hormone at 10-20 nM increased [Ca2+]i, an effect blocked by verapamil or absence of [Ca2+]o. In conclusion, growth hormone, but not changes in Vm, can increase voltage-gated Ca2+ channel activity and [Ca2+]i in white fat adipocytes.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract = {Significant recent evidence suggests that metabolism is intricately linked to the regulation and dysfunction of complex cellular and physiological responses ranging from altered metabolic programs in cancers and aging to circadian rhythms and molecular clocks. While the metabolic pathways and their fundamental control mechanisms are well established, the precise cellular mechanisms underpinning, for example, enzymatic pathway control, substrate preferences or metabolic rates, remain far less certain. Comprehensive, continuous metabolic studies on model organisms, such as the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, may provide a critical tool for deciphering these complex physiological responses. Here, we describe the development of a high-resolution calorimeter, which combines sensitive thermometry with optical imaging to concurrently perform measurements of the metabolic rate of ten individual flies, in real-time, with ~100 nW resolution. Using this calorimeter we have measured the mass-specific metabolic rates of flies of different genotypes, ages, and flies fed with different diets. This powerful new approach enables systematic studies of the metabolic regulation related to cellular and physiological function and disease mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Temperature has a profound impact on animal physiology. In this study, we examined the effect of ambient temperature on the energy stores of the model organism Drosophila melanogaster. By exposing adult males to 11 temperatures between 13 °C and 33 °C, we found that temperature significantly affects the amount of energy reserves. Whereas flies increase their fat stores at intermediate temperatures, exposure to temperatures below 15 °C or above 27 °C causes a reduction of fat reserves. Moreover, we found that glycogen stores followed a similar trend, although not so pronounced. To elucidate the underlying mechanism of these changes, we compared the temperature dependence of food consumption and metabolic rate. This analysis revealed that food intake and metabolic rate scale with temperature equally, suggesting that the temperature-induced changes in energy reserves are probably not caused by a mismatch between these two traits. Finally, we assessed the effect of temperature on starvation resistance. We found that starvation survival is a negative exponential function of temperature; however we did not find any clear evidence that implies the relative starvation resistance is compromised at non-optimal temperatures. Our results indicate that whilst optimal temperatures can promote accumulation of energy reserves, exposure to non-optimal temperatures reduces Drosophila energy stores.},

However, the mechanisms of AMPAR trafficking in vivo remain elusive. Using in vivo two-photon microscopy in the mouse somatosensory barrel cortex, we found that acute whisker stimulation led to a significant increase in the intensity of surface AMPAR GluA1 subunit (sGluA1) in both spines and dendritic shafts and a small increase in spine size relative to prestimulation values. Interestingly, the initial spine properties biased spine changes following whisker stimulation. Changes in spine sGluA1 intensity were positively correlated with changes in spine size and dendritic shaft sGluA1 intensity following whisker stimulation. The increase in spine sGluA1 intensity evoked by whisker stimulation was NMDA receptor dependent and long lasting, similar to major forms of synaptic plasticity in the brain. In this study we were able to observe experience-dependent AMPAR trafficking in real time and characterize, in vivo, a major form of synaptic plasticity in the brain.},

Included in these rules are kurtosis and skewness maximization, the quadratic form of the Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro (BCM) learning rule, and single-cell independent component analysis. Using a structure removal method, we demonstrate that receptive fields developed using these rules depend on a small portion of the distribution. We find that the quadratic form of the BCM rule behaves in a manner similar to a kurtosis maximization rule when the distribution contains kurtotic directions, although the BCM modification equations are computationally simpler.},

  abstract = {Changes in the efficacies of synapses are thought to be the neurobiological basis of learning and memory. The efficacy of a synapse depends on its current number of neurotransmitter receptors. Recent experiments have shown that these receptors are highly dynamic, moving back and forth between synapses on time scales of seconds and minutes. This suggests spontaneous fluctuations in synaptic efficacies and a competition of nearby synapses for available receptors. Here we propose a mathematical model of this competition of synapses for neurotransmitter receptors from a local dendritic pool. Using minimal assumptions, the model produces a fast multiplicative scaling behavior of synapses. Furthermore, the model explains a transient form of heterosynaptic plasticity and predicts that its amount is inversely related to the size of the local receptor pool. Overall, our model reveals logistical tradeoffs during the induction of synaptic plasticity due to the rapid exchange of neurotransmitter receptors between synapses.},

Here we show that different motor learning tasks induce dendritic Ca spikes on different apical tuft branches of individual layer V pyramidal neurons in the mouse motor cortex. These task-related, branch-specific Ca(2+) spikes cause long-lasting potentiation of postsynaptic dendritic spines active at the time of spike generation. When somatostatin-expressing interneurons are inactivated, different motor tasks frequently induce Ca spikes on the same branches. On those branches, spines potentiated during one task are depotentiated when they are active seconds before Ca spikes induced by another task. Concomitantly, increased neuronal activity and performance improvement after learning one task are disrupted when another task is learned. These findings indicate that dendritic-branch-specific generation of Ca spikes is crucial for establishing long-lasting synaptic plasticity, thereby facilitating information storage associated with different learning experiences.},

Adult flies tolerate antibiotics at high doses, although germ-free larvae show impaired development.

We introduce the Capillary Feeder (CAFE), a method allowing precise, real-time measurement of ingestion by individual or grouped fruit flies on the scale of minutes to days. Using this technique, we conducted the first quantitative analysis of prandial behavior in Drosophila melanogaster. Our results allow the dissection of feeding into discrete bouts of ingestion, defining two separate parameters, meal volume and frequency, that can be uncoupled and thus are likely to be independently regulated. In addition, our long-term measurements show that flies can ingest as much as 1.7× their body mass over 24 h. Besides the study of appetite, the CAFE can be used to monitor oral drug delivery. As an illustration, we used the CAFE to test the effects of dietary supplementation with two compounds, paraquat and ethanol, on food ingestion and preference. Paraquat, a prooxidant widely used in stress tests, had a strong anorexigenic effect. In contrast, in a feeding preference assay, ethanol-laced food, but not ethanol by itself, acted as an attractant.},

  abstract        = {During mammalian development the cerebral metabolic rate correlates qualitatively with synaptogenesis, and both often exhibit bimodal temporal profiles. Despite these non-monotonic dependencies, it is found based on empirical data for different mammals that regional metabolic rate per synapse is approximately conserved from birth to adulthood for a given species (with a slight deviation from this constancy for human visual and temporal cortices during adolescence). A typical synapse uses about (7±2)×10(3) glucose molecules per second in primate cerebral cortex, and about five times of that amount in cat and rat visual cortices. A theoretical model for brain metabolic expenditure is used to estimate synaptic signaling and neural spiking activity during development. It is found that synaptic efficacy is generally inversely correlated with average firing rate, and, additionally, synapses consume a bulk of metabolic energy, roughly 50-90% during most of the developmental process (except human temporal cortex < 50%). Overall, these results suggest a tight regulation of brain electrical and chemical activities during the formation and consolidation of neural connections. This presumably reflects strong energetic constraints on brain development.},

  abstract        = {Cancer cells simultaneously exhibit glycolysis with lactate secretion and mitochondrial respiration even in the presence of oxygen, a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect. The maintenance of this mixed metabolic phenotype is seemingly counterintuitive given that aerobic glycolysis is far less efficient in terms of ATP yield per moles of glucose than mitochondrial respiration. Here, we resolve this apparent contradiction by expanding the notion of metabolic efficiency. We study a reduced flux balance model of ATP production that is constrained by the glucose uptake capacity and by the solvent capacity of the cell's cytoplasm, the latter quantifying the maximum amount of macromolecules that can occupy the intracellular space. At low glucose uptake rates we find that mitochondrial respiration is indeed the most efficient pathway for ATP generation. Above a threshold glucose uptake rate, however, a gradual activation of aerobic glycolysis and slight decrease of mitochondrial respiration results in the highest rate of ATP production. Our analyses indicate that the Warburg effect is a favorable catabolic state for all rapidly proliferating mammalian cells with high glucose uptake capacity. It arises because while aerobic glycolysis is less efficient than mitochondrial respiration in terms of ATP yield per glucose uptake, it is more efficient in terms of the required solvent capacity. These results may have direct relevance to chemotherapeutic strategies attempting to target cancer metabolism.},

Carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins all ultimately break down into glucose, which then serves as the primary metabolic fuel of mammals and the universal fuel of the fetus. It serves as the major precursor for the synthesis of different carbohydrates like glycogen, ribose, and deoxyribose, galactose, glycolipids, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans. On the contrary, in plants, glucose is synthesized from carbon dioxide and water (photosynthesis) and stored as starch. At the cellular level, most often, glucose is the final substrate that enters the tissue cells and converts to ATP (adenosine triphosphate). ATP is the energy currency of the body and is consumed in multiple ways including the active transport of molecules across cell membranes, contraction of muscles and performance of mechanical work, synthetic reactions that help to create hormones, cell membranes, and other essential molecules, nerve impulse conduction, cell division and growth, and other physiologic functions.[1]},

To solve this question, we asked whether neuronal fueling by glucose or lactate scales differently upon increasing neural computation and cognitive loads. Here, using electrophysiology, two-photon imaging, cognitive tasks, and mathematical modeling, we show that both glucose and lactate are involved in engram formation, with lactate supporting long-term synaptic plasticity evoked by high-stimulation load activity patterns and high attentional load in cognitive tasks and glucose being sufficient for less demanding neural computation and learning tasks. Indeed, we show that lactate is mandatory for demanding neural computation, such as theta-burst stimulation, while glucose is sufficient for lighter forms of activity-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP), such as spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). We find that subtle variations of spike number or frequency in STDP are sufficient to shift the on-demand fueling from glucose to lactate. Finally, we demonstrate that lactate is necessary for a cognitive task requiring high attentional load, such as the object-in-place task, and for the corresponding in vivo hippocampal LTP expression but is not needed for a less demanding task, such as a simple novel object recognition. Overall, these results demonstrate that glucose and lactate metabolism are differentially engaged in neuronal fueling depending on the complexity of the activity-dependent plasticity and behavior.},

  abstract = "Performance errors are associated with robust behavioral and
              electroencephalography (EEG) effects. However, there is a debate
              about the nature of the relationship between these effects and
              implicit versus explicit error awareness. Our aim was to study
              the relationship between error related electrophysiological
              effects, such as spectral perturbations in fronto-medial theta
              band oscillations (FMT), and error awareness in typing. Typing
              has an advantage as an experimental paradigm in that detected
              errors are quickly and habitually signaled by the participant
              using backspace, allowing separation of detected from undetected
              errors without interruption in behavior. Typing is thought to be
              controlled hierarchically via inner and outer loops, which rely
              on different sources for error detection. Touch-typist
              participants were asked to copy-type 100 sentences as EEG was
              recorded in the absence of visual feedback. Continuous EEG data
              were analyzed using independent component analysis (ICA).
              Time-frequency and ERP analyses were applied to emergent
              independent components. The results show that single-trial FMT
              parameters and error related negativity (ERN) amplitude predict
              overt, adaptive posterror actions such as error correction via
              backspace; and, posterror slowing, reflecting implicit error
              awareness. In addition, we found that those uncorrected errors
              which were slowed down the most were also the ones associated
              with a high level of FMT activity. Our results as a whole show
              that FMT are related to neural mechanisms involved in explicit
              awareness of errors, and input from inner loop is sufficient for
              error correction in typing. (PsycINFO Database Record",

abstract = {The persistence of protein synthesis-dependent long-term potentiation (late-LTP) is thought to require heterosynaptic activation of both glutamate and neuromodulatory receptors in the hippocampus (Trends Neurosci. 21 (1998) 181; Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 93 (1996) 13445). The present series of experiments contrasts two alternative accounts of heterosynaptic activation. The original version of the synaptic-tag hypothesis of the variable persistence of LTP (Nature 385 (1997) 533) implied that neuromodulatory and glutamatergic activation could occur independently, albeit within a critical time-window; an alternative view is that there needs to be simultaneous co-activation of both receptors to trigger the up-regulation of relevant protein synthesis (Neuron 34 (2002) 235). Our findings include a replication, over 6 h post-LTP-induction, of earlier findings showing heterosynaptic influences on LTP persistence (Nature 385 (1997) 533; Neuropharmacology 37 (1998) 545). Specifically, ‘strong’ tetanisation with multiple trains of stimulation of one input pathway in a conventional hippocampal slice preparation induces a D1/D5 receptor-dependent form of late-LTP that enables ‘weak’ tetanic stimulation to induce late-LTP on an independent pathway. However, we also observed that when the first pathway was tetanised in the presence of AP5, not only was no LTP observed on that pathway, but there was also no rescue of late-LTP on the second pathway. Thus, it appears that DA receptors must be co-activated with NMDA receptors in a common pool of neurons to enable LTP persistence, although late-LTP can still be induced by selective activation of glutamatergic synapses if this occurs at time periods shortly before or shortly after this essential coactivation.}

Here, we formalize such training strategies in the context of machine learning, and call them "curriculum learning". In the context of recent research studying the difficulty of training in the presence of non-convex training criteria (for deep deterministic and stochastic neural networks), we explore curriculum learning in various set-ups. The experiments show that significant improvements in generalization can be achieved. We hypothesize that curriculum learning has both an effect on the speed of convergence of the training process to a minimum and, in the case of non-convex criteria, on the quality of the local minima obtained: curriculum learning can be seen as a particular form of continuation method (a general strategy for global optimization of non-convex functions).},

However, the majority of biologically-plausible learning algorithms have not yet reached the performance of backpropagation (BP), nor are they built on strong theoretical foundations. Here, we analyze target propagation (TP), a popular but not yet fully understood alternative to BP, from the standpoint of mathematical optimization. Our theory shows that TP is closely related to Gauss-Newton optimization and thus substantially differs from BP. Furthermore, our analysis reveals a fundamental limitation of difference target propagation (DTP), a well-known variant of TP, in the realistic scenario of non-invertible neural networks. We provide a first solution to this problem through a novel reconstruction loss that improves feedback weight training, while simultaneously introducing architectural flexibility by allowing for direct feedback connections from the output to each hidden layer. Our theory is corroborated by experimental results that show significant improvements in performance and in the alignment of forward weight updates with loss gradients, compared to DTP.},

abstract = {Abstract Learning from errors or negative feedback is crucial for adaptive behavior. FMRI studies have demonstrated enhanced anterior cingulate cortex activity for errors that were later corrected versus repeated errors even when a substantial delay between the error and the opportunity to correct was introduced. We aimed at identifying the electrophysiological correlates of these processes by investigating the feedback-related negativity (FRN) and stimulus-locked P3. Participants had to learn and recall the location of 2-digit targets over consecutive rounds. Feedback was provided in two steps, first a color change indicated a correct or incorrect response (feedback phase) followed by presentation of the correct digit information (re-encoding phase). Behaviorally, participants improved performance from the first to the third round. FRN amplitudes time-locked to feedback were enhanced for corrected compared to repeated errors. The P3 in response to re-encoding did not differ between the two error types. The finding that FRN amplitudes positively predicted memory performance is consistent with the idea that the FRN reflects prediction errors and the need for enhanced cognitive control. Interestingly, this happens early during feedback processing and not at a later time point when re-encoding of correct information takes place. The prediction error signal reflected in the FRN is usually elicited by performance errors, but may thus also play a role in preparing/optimizing the system for memory formation. This supports the existence of a close link between action control and memory processes even when there is a substantial delay between error feedback and the opportunity to correct the error.},

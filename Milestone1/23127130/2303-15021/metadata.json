    "abstract": "We extend classical Propositional Logic (PL) by adding a new primitive binary connective $\\varphi|ψ$, intended to represent the \"superposition\" of sentences $\\varphi$ and $ψ$, an operation motivated by the corresponding notion of quantum mechanics, but not intended to capture all aspects of the latter as they appear in physics. To interpret the new connective, we extend the classical Boolean semantics by employing models of the form $\\langle M,f\\rangle$, where $M$ is an ordinary two-valued assignment for the sentences of PL and $f$ is a choice function for all pairs of classical sentences. In the new semantics $\\varphi|ψ$ is strictly interpolated between $\\varphi\\wedgeψ$ and $\\varphi\\veeψ$. By imposing several constraints on the choice functions we obtain corresponding notions of logical consequence relations and corresponding systems of tautologies, with respect to which $|$ satisfies some natural algebraic properties such as associativity, closedness under logical equivalence and distributivity over its dual connective. Thus various systems of Propositional Superposition Logic (PLS) arise as extensions of PL. Axiomatizations for these systems of tautologies are presented and soundness is shown for all of them. Completeness is proved for the weakest of these systems. For the other systems completeness holds if and only if every consistent set of sentences is extendible to a consistent and complete one, a condition whose truth is closely related to the validity of the deduction theorem.",

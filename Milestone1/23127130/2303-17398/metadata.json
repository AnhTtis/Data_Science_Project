    "abstract": "In this work, we propose an approach to teaching global warming adapted to the new high school curricula. The aim is to build a link between CO$_2$ emissions and the rise in the Earth's average temperature, based as far as possible on explicit empirical evidence. We first present the existing teaching approaches on the subject, which are then related to the a prioir students' ideas, in particular: the non-evidence of interactions between gases and radiation. The didactic choices structuring the approach are then exposed. They are based on the interpretation of experiments carried out with an infrared camera in a spectral range allowing the emission and absorption of CO$_2$ to be seen.",

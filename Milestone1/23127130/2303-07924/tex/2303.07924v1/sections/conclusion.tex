\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Recognition of accented speech remains a challenging task. In this work, we showed the positive influence of using multi-domain fine-tuning datasets both on in-domain and out-of-domain accents. We experimented with various ways of combining training sets and achieved remarkable gains on our evaluation accents compared to single-domain baselines. We leave as future work the collection and evaluation of new accents, as well as the experimentation of new methods for generating accented speech for low-resource accents.

    "abstract": "Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety over $\\mathbb{C}$ with big (anti-)canonical bundle. It is known that in this situation the Balmer spectrum of the tensor triangulated category of perfect complexes $Perf(X)$ of $X$ equipped with the derived tensor product $\\otimes_{X}^{\\mathbb{L}}$ recovers the space $X$. In this work we study the possible tensor triangulated category structures one can put on $Perf(X)$. As an application we prove a monoidal version of the well-known Bondal-Orlov reconstruction theorem.",

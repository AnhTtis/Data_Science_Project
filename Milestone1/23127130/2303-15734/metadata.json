    "abstract": "This paper presents our work to enhance the background music (BGM) in DareFightingICE by adding an adaptive BGM. The adaptive BGM consists of five different instruments playing a classical music piece called \"Air on G-String.\" The BGM adapts by changing the volume of the instruments. Each instrument is connected to a different element of the game. We then run experiments to evaluate the adaptive BGM by using a deep reinforcement learning AI that only uses audio as input (Blind DL AI). The results show that the performance of the Blind DL AI improves while playing with the adaptive BGM as compared to playing without the adaptive BGM.",

This section contains additional details of our analysis in \Cref{sec:micro-credit}. 

\Cref{fig:micro-scatter} shows a scatter-plot for the data and the presence of outliers.

\Cref{fig:micro-log-scale-plots} shows the 90\% OS-bootstrap confidence bands for the AIT estimates, with the $x$-axis scaled to emphasize the uncertainty for small values of $\epsilon$. 

\Cref{fig:micro-okl-plot} plots minimum-OKL estimate for various values $\epsilon$, along with the associated 90\% bootstrap confidence bands.

\Cref{fig:micro-outlier-hist-plot} shows the distribution of profit values for points that were declared as outliers by the OWL procedure at the  parameter value $\epsilon_0$.

    \caption{Scatter-plot of the household profit values across treated and non-treated households. Even after removing the  household with the extreme profit of -40000 USD PPP, there are still households with extreme profit values that cause brittleness in estimating the average treatment effect.}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figures/micro_ate_log.pdf}
    \caption{The plot from the left panel of \Cref{fig:micro_fig}, plotted on a re-scaled $x$-axis to emphasize the uncertainty in the AIT estimates for small values of $\epsilon$. The confidence bands become narrow roughly at the tuned value of $\epsilon_0 = 0.005$ (\Cref{sec:tune-epsilon}), suggesting that the outliers that cause brittleness may  have been down-weighted by OWL for $\epsilon = \epsilon_0$.}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figures/micro_okl_linear.pdf}
    \caption{The minimum OKL estimate (i.e. $\hat{R}(\epsilon) = \min_{\theta \in \Theta} \hat{I}_\epsilon(\theta)$) versus $\epsilon$ plot for the micro-credit example. Using the notion of curvature in \Cref{sec:tune-epsilon}, the value $\epsilon_0 = 0.005$ was identified as the point at which this graph has its prominent kink. The $90\%$ confidence bands under $m=50$ OS-bootstrap iterations are also shown.}

    \caption{The profit distribution for households that were declared to be inliers ($\{ i : w_i < 1 \}$) versus outliers ($\{ i: w_i \leq 1 \}$) by the OWL procedure at parameter $\epsilon_0$. For clarity, we omitted an outlying household with a profit value of less that $-40K$ USD PPP.}

The smoothed total variation distance  $\abs{\tv(P,Q) - \tvk{\K}(P,Q)} \leq \tv(P, P \star \K) + \tv(Q, Q \star \K)$ holds. Hence taking $\K=\K_h$ -- a probability density kernel (e.g. RBF kernel) with bandwidth parameter $h > 0$ -- by Scheffe's lemma, the terms on the right hand side of the last inequality can be made arbitrarily small if $P$ and $Q$ have sufficiently smooth densities with respect to $\lambda$.

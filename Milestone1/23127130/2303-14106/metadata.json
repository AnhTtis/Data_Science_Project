    "abstract": "By design, quasi delay-insensitive (QDI) circuits exhibit higher resilience against timing variations as compared to their synchronous counterparts. Since computation in QDI circuits is event-based rather than clock-triggered, spurious events due to transient faults such as radiation-induced glitches, a priori are of higher concern in QDI circuits.\n  In this work we propose a formal framework with the goal to gain a deeper understanding on how susceptible QDI circuits are to transient faults. We introduce a worst-case model for transients in circuits. We then prove an equivalence of faults within this framework and use this result to provably exhaustively check QDI circuits, a linear Muller pipeline and a cyclic Muller pipeline, for their susceptibility to produce non-stable output signals.",

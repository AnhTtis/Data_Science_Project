\section{Limitations}
\label{sec:limitations}

While the evaluation of the interviewbot has shown its promising application, we would like to summarize its limitations for future improvement.
First, the current interviewbot still has the early-ending issue in conversations, in which the ending utterances would be generated after non-sufficient number of turns. 
In this case, the conversation would not be able to cover discussions on critical aspects of applicants.
Second, although the interviewbot has certain capabilities to follow up on certain topics brought up during a conversation, it is expected to perform deeper discussions on more details.
Third, the bot cannot handle name entities, such as people's names, in conversations, although, in most of the conversations, the interviewbot chose not to mention name entities at all.
Last, in some conversations, the interviewbot still generates repeated or random ordering of words and punctuations.

% The application of chatbots is trending in many domains, such as education \cite{okonkwo2021chatbots}, healthcare\cite{safi2020technical}, commodity \cite{khoa2021impact}, and so on. In this section, we give a general review of the categories of chatbots and applications in different fields.

%End-to-end dialogue systems are trending in the frontier of research. 
%In this section, we give a brief review of the categories of, as well as the state of the art generative models for end-to-end dialogue systems.

%\subsection{Categorical Anatomy}
%\label{ssec:categorical-anatomy}

Dialogue systems can be categorized into closed- and open-domain systems \cite{ilievski2018goal}.
Closed-domain systems require efficient access to domain knowledge \cite{lian2019learning} and serve specific professions such as education \cite{cunningham2019review}, healthcare \cite{fan2021utilization,amiri2022chatbot}, or customer service \cite{baier2018conversational,nichifor2021artificial}.
Open-domain systems converse across multiple domains with natural transitions \cite{adiwardana2020towards} and conduct interactions in a broader horizon \cite{ahmadvand2018emory, wang2017emersonbot, finch2020emora}.
For admission interviews, however, the conversation is often a mixture of closed (job-related questions) and open domains (general aspects of the applicant) dialogues, which makes it more challenging to build an end-to-end system.

Several dialogue systems have been developed to communicate with humans for information exchange or elicitation \cite{finch2020emora, li2017confiding, Kim2019Comparing} across multiple domains \cite{safi2020technical,khoa2021impact,okonkwo2021chatbots}.
Conversational agents for interviews have been experimented with for law enforcement \cite{minhas2022protecting}, healthcare \cite{ni2017mandy}, job application \cite{xiao2019should}, and psychology \cite{siddig2019psychologist}, among which most are proof of concept. 
A few interviewbots have been developed on commercial platforms such as Google Dialogflow and IBM Watson Assistant, with the limitation of pre-scripted interviews; thus, they cannot proactively follow up to the user contents.

%\subsection{Large-scale Pre-trained Generative Models}


%Pre-trained language models have achieved privileged performance in Natural Language Understanding, as well as Natural Language Generation.
%~\citet{zhang-etal-2020-dialogpt} developed and trained GPTDialogue on massive amount of Reddit data.
%~\citet{adiwardana2020towards} built Meena that advanced the generation of multi-turn conversation.
%Blenderbot 1.0 \cite{roller-etal-2021-recipes}, and Blenderbot 2.0 \cite{xu-etal-2022-beyond} are two consecutive dialogue system advancements that can maintain impressive context-aware interactions. 
%Plato and its variations \cite{bao-etal-2020-plato, bao2021plato} have achieved noticeable performance both on English and Chinese.

%In this paper, we take advantage of the pre-trained Blenderbot 1.0 and integrate arbitrary-length context into the dialogue generation. Although Blenderbot 2.0 is more advanced, the context integration serves different purposes and we proceeded by constructing our model based on Blenderbot 1.0.

% \label{broader-impact}
The future application of the Interviewbot will impact thousands of students applying to U.S. colleges. 
While institutions emphasizing on the research environment, the Interviewbot could help students understand the basics of research conduct of ethics, and even admission committees to make decisions on students' readiness in compliance of code of ethics in research, through interview conversations.

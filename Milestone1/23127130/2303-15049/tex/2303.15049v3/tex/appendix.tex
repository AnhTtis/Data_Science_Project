\subsection{Chatbot Demonstration}

\noindent Table~\ref{tab:interview-example} presents an example dialogue conducted by our chatbot, showcasing the utilization of sliding window and topic storing (CT) techniques. 
Overall, the chatbot demonstrates its ability to conduct a comprehensive interview by asking relevant follow-up questions, adapting to various conversation topics, and providing meaningful responses accordingly.




\subsection{Examples of Diarization Errors}
\label{app:diarization-error-example}

\noindent The following are examples to illustrate the sources of diarization errors (\uwave{underlined}).
In many cases, interviewers and interviewees overlap in speeches or thinking out loud with or without filler words, which concatenates the two utterances.
A small portion of diarization errors are from speech recognition and word repetition errors.


\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Arbitrary Concatenation} \\
    \textit{What do you think the benefits might be of this kind of technology? \uwave{If we develop it, I think this technology will eventually replace, um, human delivery.}}\vspace{0.5em}
    \item \textbf{Filler Words} \\
    \textit{Oh, no, I'm going to make majoring mathematics. \uwave{Okay. Okay.} Now why, why do you think receiving an education is important?}\vspace{0.5em}
    \item \textbf{Speech Recognition} \\
    \textit{Um, okay. My name is \uwave{<inaudible>}. I'm a senior year student come from \uwave{Hunger-Free}. Which high school are you from?}\vspace{0.5em}
    \item \textbf{Word Repetition}\\
    \textit{I heard it said, so it's kind of like a DIY \uwave{community community}. Are there community activities?}\vspace{0.5em}
\end{itemize}


\noindent We conduct speaker diarization errors by annotating 100 conversations with an average of 39 turns. The type of errors with their stats are shown in Table \ref{tab:speaker-diarization-error}. The major errors are caused by filler words and arbitrary concatenation. Counts of single errors are counted.
Table \ref{tab:error-type-example} listed examples underlined for each type of error, respectively.

\noindent From the table, there are different occasions for ASR errors, such as words not transcribed, words transcribed incorrectly, etc.
Word repetitions happen rarely when non-filler words repeat in a sentence. 
Concatenations of two adjacent utterances take the largest portion of all errors.


\subsection{Examples of Generation Limitations}
\label{app:generation-errors}

\noindent The following are examples for each type of generation error (\uwave{underlined}). 
An early ending prevents the Interviewbot from covering critical aspects of applicants and further discussion. 
The Interviewbot cannot name mentions properly, either skipping over or generating the wrong entities in the conversations.
Random Generation generates random words and punctuation and concatenates them incorrectly.
Not following up on previous topics hinders the Interviewbot from becoming proactively engaged with interviewees.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Early Ending}\\
        InterviewBot: Could you please state your name?\\
        Interviewee: Sure. My name is David.\\
        ... 4 more turns ...\\
        InterviewBot: \uwave{Thank you and best wishes to your applications.}\vspace{0.5em}
    \item \textbf{Repetition}
        InterviewBot: Now why, why do you think receiving an education is important?\\
        ... more turns ...\\
        InterviewBot: Why do you think people value education so much?\vspace{0.5em}
    \item \textbf{Off Topic}
        Interviewee: Sure, I really like Mathemathcs.\\
        InterviewBot: \uwave{What do you do for fun?}
\end{itemize}

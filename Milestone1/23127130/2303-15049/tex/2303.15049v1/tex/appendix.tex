\subsection{Interviewee Demographics}
\label{app:interviewee-demographics}

We summarize the demographics of the interviewees in this section.
Table \ref{fig:interviewee-age-demographics} shows the distribution of the ages of applicants. 
Most interviewees are between 17 to 19, which is an accurate reflection of the ages of high school students applying to colleges.

The distribution of countries of origin of applicants is shown in Figure \ref{fig:interviewee-country-demographics}.
There are 38 countries in total.
The majority of applicants come from China.
Other major countries are Belgium, Bangladesh, Canada, India and Belarus.

The gender distribution of applicants is shown in Figure \ref{fig:interviewee-gender-demographics}. 
The numbers of male and female applicants are close, with exclusion of applicants not providing gender information.

\subsection{Examples of Diarization Errors}
\label{app:diarization-error-example}

The following are examples to illustrate the sources of diarization errors (\uwave{underlined}).
In many case, interviewers and interviewees overlap on speeches or thinking out loud with or without filler words, which concatenates the two utterances.
A small portion of diarization errors are from speech recognition and word repetition errors.


\begin{itemize}
    \item[--] Arbitrary Concatenation
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[$\ast$] What do you think the benefits might be of this kind of technology? \uwave{If we develop it, I think this technology will eventually replace, um, human delivery.}
    \end{itemize}
    \item[--] Filler Words
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[$\ast$] Oh, no, I'm going to make majoring mathematics. \uwave{Okay. Okay.} Now why, why do you think receiving an education is important?
    \end{itemize} 
    \item[--] Speech Recognition
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[$\ast$] Um, okay. My name is \uwave{<inaudible>}. I'm a senior year student come from \uwave{Hunger-Free}. Which high school are you from?
    \end{itemize} 
    \item[--] Word Repetition
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[$\ast$] I heard it said, so it's kind of like a DIY \uwave{community community}. Are there community activities?
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{table}[htbp!]
\centering\small{ %\resizebox{\columnwidth}{!}{
\begin{tabular}{c|l} 
\toprule
      \bf Error Type & \multicolumn{1}{c}{\bf Examples} \\
\midrule
\tt ASR & Um, okay. My name is \uwave{<inaudible>}. I'm a\\ 
    & senior year student come from \uwave{Hunger-Free} \\
    & language school.\\

\end{table}
 

We conduct speaker diarization errors by annotating 100 conversations with an average of 39 turns. The type of errors with their stats are shown in Table \ref{tab:speaker-diarization-error}. The major errors are caused by filler words and arbitrary concatenation. Counts of single errors are counted. Table \ref{tab:error-type-example} listed examples underlined for each type of errors respectively.

\begin{table}[htbp!]
\centering\small{ %\resizebox{\columnwidth}{!}{
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\toprule
 {\bf Count} & {\bf Type} &  & \\
\midrule
212 & Misc & ASR: 147 & WR: 65 \\
289 & FW & & \\
378 & AC & & \\
\# of Convs & 100 & & \\
Avg \# of turns & 39 & & \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}}
\caption{Speaker diarization error analysis in the text transcription from interview recordings. Notions are Misc: Miscellaneous; ASR: Auto Speech Recognition; WR: Word Repetition; FW: Filler Words; AC: Adjacent Concatenation.}
\label{tab:speaker-diarization-error}
\end{table}



From the table, there are different occasions for ASR errors, such as words are not transcribed, words transcribed incorrectly, etc.
Word repetitions happen rarely when non-filler words repeat in a sentence. 
Concatenations of two adjacent utterances take the largest portion of all errors.


\subsection{Examples of Generation Limitations}
\label{app:generation-errors}

The following are examples for each type of generation errors (\uwave{underlined}). 
Early ending prevents the Interviewbot from covering critical aspects of applicants and further discussion. 
The Interviewbot cannot name mentions properly, either skipping over or generating wrong entities in the conversations.
Random Generation generates random words and punctuation, and concatenates them incorrectly.
Not following up on previous topics hinders the Interviewbot from becoming proactively engaged with interviewees.

\begin{itemize}
    \item[--] Early Ending
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[$\ast$] InterviewBot: Could you please state your name?
        \item[$\ast$] Interviewee: Sure. My name is David.
        \item[$\ast$] ... 4 more turns ...
        \item[$\ast$] InterviewBot: \uwave{Thank you and best wishes to your applications.} 
    \end{itemize}
    \item[--] Repetition
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[$\ast$] InterviewBot: Now why, why do you think receiving an education is important?
        \item[$\ast$] ... more turns ...
        \item[$\ast$] InterviewBot: Why do you think people value education so much?
    \end{itemize} 
    \item[--] Off Topic
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[$\ast$] Interviewee: Sure, I really like Mathemathcs.
        \item[$\ast$] InterviewBot: \uwave{What do you do for fun?}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

    "abstract": "Let $G$ be a group. Write $G^{*}=G\\setminus \\{1\\}$.\n  An element $x$ of $G^{*}$ will be called deficient if $ \\langle x\\rangle < C_G(x)$ and it will be called non-deficient if $\\langle x\\rangle = C_G(x).$\n  If $x\\in G$ is deficient (non-deficient), then the conjugacy class $x^G$ of $x$ in $G$ will be also called deficient (non-deficient).\n  Let $j$ be a non-negative integer. We shall say that the group $G$ has defect $j$, denoted by $G\\in D(j)$ or by the phrase \"$G$ is a $D(j)$-group\", if exactly $j$ non-trivial conjugacy classes of $G$ are deficient.\n  We first determine all finite $D(0)$-groups and $D(1)$-groups.\n  Then we deal with arbitrary $D(0)$-groups and $D(1)$-groups: we find properties of arbitrary $D(0)$-groups and $D(1)$-groups, which force these groups to be finite.",

    "abstract": "We discuss the aspects of axion-like-particles (ALPs) searches with Light-Shining-through-Wall (LSW) experimental setups consisted of two radio-frequency cavities. We compare the efficiencies of three setups which involve the cavity pump modes and external magnetic fields. Additionally, we discuss the sensitivity dependence both on the relative position of two cylindrical cavities and on their radius-to-length ratio.",

  abstract =  {Evaluating the role of perturbations versus the intrinsic coherent dynamics in driving to equilibrium is of fundamental interest to understand quantum many-body thermalization, in the quest to build ever complex quantum devices. Here we introduce a protocol that scales down the coupling strength in a quantum simulator based on a solid-state nuclear spin system, leading to a longer decay time T2, while keeping perturbations associated to control error constant. We can monitor quantum information scrambling by measuring two powerful metrics, out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) and Loschmidt Echoes (LEs). While OTOCs reveal quantum information scrambling involving hundreds of spins, the LE decay quantifies, via the time scale T3, how well the scrambled information can be recovered through time reversal. We find that when the interactions dominate the perturbation, the LE decay rate only depends on the interactions themselves, T3 ~ T2, and not on the perturbation. Then, in an unbounded many-spin system, decoherence can achieve a perturbation-independent regime, with a rate only related to the local second moment of the Hamiltonian.},

    abstract = { Experimental advances have allowed for the exploration of nearly isolated quantum many-body systems whose coupling to an external bath is very weak. A particularly interesting class of such systems is those that do not thermalize under their own isolated quantum dynamics. In this review, we highlight the possibility for such systems to exhibit new nonequilibrium phases of matter. In particular, we focus on discrete time crystals, which are many-body phases of matter characterized by a spontaneously broken discrete time-translation symmetry. We give a definition of discrete time crystals from several points of view, emphasizing that they are a nonequilibrium phenomenon that is stabilized by many-body interactions, with no analog in noninteracting systems. We explain the theory behind several proposed models of discrete time crystals, and compare several recent realizations, in different experimental contexts. }

    "abstract": "Deep Learning (DL) developers come from different backgrounds, e.g., medicine, genomics, finance, and computer science. To create a DL model, they must learn and use high-level programming languages (e.g., Python), thus needing to handle related setups and solve programming errors. This paper presents DeepBlocks, a visual programming tool that allows DL developers to design, train, and evaluate models without relying on specific programming languages. DeepBlocks works by building on the typical model structure: a sequence of learnable functions whose arrangement defines the specific characteristics of the model. We derived DeepBlocks' design goals from a 5-participants formative interview, and we validated the first implementation of the tool through a typical use case. Results are promising and show that developers could visually design complex DL architectures.",

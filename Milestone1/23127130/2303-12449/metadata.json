    "abstract": "We build an explicit $C^1$ isometric embedding $f_{\\infty}:\\mathbb{H}^2\\to\\mathbb{E}^3$ of the hyperbolic plane whose image is relatively compact. Its limit set is a closed curve of Hausdorff dimension 1. Our construction generates iteratively a sequence of maps by adding at each step $k$ a layer of $N_{k}$ corrugations. In parallel, we introduce a formal corrugation process leading to a limit map $Φ_{\\infty}:\\mathbb{H}^2\\to \\mathcal{L}(\\mathbb{R}^2,\\mathbb{R}^3)$ that we call the formal analogue of $df_{\\infty}$. We show that $Φ_{\\infty}$ approximates $df_{\\infty}$. In fact, when the sequence of corrugation numbers $(N_{k})_{k}$ grows to infinity the map $Φ_{\\infty}$ encodes the asymptotic behavior of $df_{\\infty}$. Moreover, analysing the geometry of $Φ_{\\infty}$ appears much easier than studying $f_{\\infty}$. In particular, we are able to exhibit a form of self-similarity of $Φ_{\\infty}$.",

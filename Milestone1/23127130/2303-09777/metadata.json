    "abstract": "The multiplexing capabilities of superconducting X-ray free-electron lasers (FELs) have gained much attention in recent years. The demanding requirements for photon properties from multiple undulator lines necessitate more flexible beam manipulation techniques to achieve the goal of \"beam on demand\". In this paper, we investigate a multiplexed configuration for the photoinjector of high-repetition-rate FELs that aims to simultaneously provide low-emittance electron beams of different charges. A parallel, multi-objective genetic algorithm is implemented for the photoinjector parameter optimization. The proposed configuration could drastically enhance the flexibility of beam manipulation to improve multiplexing capabilities and realize the full potential of the facility.",

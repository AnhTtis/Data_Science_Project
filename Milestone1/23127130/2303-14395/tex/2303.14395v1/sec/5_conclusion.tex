We proposed to mine discriminative query embeddings to segment occluded instances on challenging videos. We first initialized the positional and content embeddings of frame-level queries by considering instance spatio-temporal features. We then performed contrastive learning on instance embeddings by proposing a new inter-instance mask repulsion loss.
The proposed per-clip VIS method, termed as MDQE, was validated on OVIS and YouTube-VIS datasets. The experimental results showed that the mined discriminative embeddings of instance queries can teach the query-based segmenter to better distinguish occluded instances in crowded scenes, improving significantly performance on the challenging OVIS dataset.

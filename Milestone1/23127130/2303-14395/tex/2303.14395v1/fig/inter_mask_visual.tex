\caption{Segmentation on heavily occluded objects by MDQE with typical mask prediction loss and our inter-instance mask repulsion loss. The red, green and blue dots highlight the initial query positions selected by our proposed query initialization method. The last two rows display the predicted masks on the occluded instance and the occluder instance.}\label{fig:inter_mask_visual}

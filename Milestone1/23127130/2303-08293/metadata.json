    "abstract": "Metric learning plays an essential role in image analysis and classification, and it has attracted more and more attention. In this paper, we propose a quantum adversarial metric learning (QAML) model based on the triplet loss function, where samples are embedded into the high-dimensional Hilbert space and the optimal metric is obtained by minimizing the triplet loss function. The QAML model employs entanglement and interference to build superposition states for triplet samples so that only one parameterized quantum circuit is needed to calculate sample distances, which reduces the demand for quantum resources. Considering the QAML model is fragile to adversarial attacks, an adversarial sample generation strategy is designed based on the quantum gradient ascent method, effectively improving the robustness against the functional adversarial attack. Simulation results show that the QAML model can effectively distinguish samples of MNIST and Iris datasets and has higher robustness accuracy over the general quantum metric learning. The QAML model is a fundamental research problem of machine learning. As a subroutine of classification and clustering tasks, the QAML model opens an avenue for exploring quantum advantages in machine learning.",

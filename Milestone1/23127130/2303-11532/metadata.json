    "abstract": "We show that if $\\mathbb{R} = A \\cup B$ is a partition of $\\mathbb{R}$ into two suborders $A$ and $B$, then there is an open interval $I$ such that $A \\cap I$ is not order-isomorphic to $B \\cap I$. The proof depends on the completeness of $\\mathbb{R}$, and we show in contrast that there is a partition of the irrationals $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\mathbb{Q} = A \\cup B$ such that $A \\cap I$ is isomorphic to $B \\cap I$ for every open interval $I$. We do not know if there is a partition of $\\mathbb{R}$ into three suborders that are isomorphic in every open interval.",

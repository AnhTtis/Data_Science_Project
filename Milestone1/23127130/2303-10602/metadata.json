    "abstract": "Let $\\M$ be a type ${\\rm II_1}$ factor and let $τ$ be the faithful normal tracial state on $\\M$. In this paper, we prove that given finite elements $X_1,\\cdots X_n \\in \\M$, there is a finite decomposition of the identity into $N \\in \\NNN$ mutually orthogonal nonzero projections $E_j\\in\\M$, $I=\\sum_{j=1}^NE_j$, such that $E_jX_iE_j=τ(X_i) E_j$ for all $j=1,\\cdots,N$ and $i=1,\\cdots,n$. Equivalently, there is a unitary operator $U \\in \\M$ such that $\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}{U^*}^jX_iU^j=τ(X_i)I$ for $i=1,\\cdots,n$. This result is a stronger version of Dixmier's averaging theorem for type ${\\rm II}_1$ factors. As the first application, we show that all elements of trace zero in a type ${\\rm II}_1$ factor are single commutators and any self-adjoint elements of trace zero are single self-commutators. This result answers affirmatively Question 1.1 in [10]. As the second application, we prove that any self-adjoint element in a type ${\\rm II}_1$ factor can be written a linear combination of 4 projections. This result answers affirmatively Question 6(2) in [15]. As the third application, we show that if $(\\mathcal{M},τ)$ is a finite factor, $X \\in \\mathcal{M}$, then there exists a normal operator $N \\in \\mathcal{M}$ and a nilpotent operator $K$ such that $X= N+ K$. This result answers affirmatively Question 1.1 in [9].",

    "abstract": "It is known that a simply connected Riemann surface satisfies the isoperimetric equality if and only if it has constant Gaussian curvature. In this article, we show that Randers Poincaré disc satisfies the isoperimetric equality with respect to different volume forms. These metrics do not necessarily have constant (negative) flag curvature. Thus we show that the Osserman's result \\cite{RO} in the Riemannian case can not be extended to the corresponding Finslerian case.",

\subsection{Rigid Body Augmentation}
Rigid body simulations are key ingredients in many video games and virtual reality applications. A rigid body can also also be interpreted as a very simple specific case of a linear blend skinning, with only a single bone of constant weight equal to 1 across all the vertices.
We exploit this analogy to augment real-time rigid-body simulations with secondary effects (\reffig{rigid_body_augmentation} shows screenshots from an interactive bowling game, where the pins are stylized with secondary effects.)

Animators often design large suites of rig animations, often having to browse and edit many of these in rapid succession. Adding on to the tediousness of this process, they also have to foresee how these animations will look when augmented with secondary motion. 
Our method allows a user to browse through any number of rig-animations and immediately observe the secondary secondary dynamics in real-time. We demonstrate this for a character downloaded from the Mixamo~\shortcite{Mixamo} website in \reffig{mixamo-rig-switching-app}.

%\subsection{Real-Time Dynamics on Top of Inverse Kinematics}
%Many character controllers in video games make use of inverse kinematics (I.K.) to automatically edit the pose of a character equipped with a complex skeleton with simple end-effector constraints. 
%\reffig{fast_cd_augmenting_ik} demonstrates that we can directly plug in the output of an arbitrary I.K. controller and augment it with rich secondary motion in real-time.

\subsection{Secondary Dynamics for Digital Avatars}
Digital avatars are key to expressing personality and style in virtual environments. We show that our Fast Complementary Dynamics can be plugged into  very simple camera based pose trackers made available by mediapipe \cite{lugaresi2019mediapipe} to breath life into these digital avatars. \reffig{dynamic_snapchat_filters} demonstrates augmenting human faces tracked by mediapipe's Faces solution with secondary motion. 
Similarly, \reffig{pose_tracker_king_ghidorah} augment skeletons tracked by mediapipe's Pose solution with real-time secondary motion. In practice the bottleneck of this application became mediapipe's own Pose solution, requiring us to separate the tracker from the dynamics and place them into two separate threads.

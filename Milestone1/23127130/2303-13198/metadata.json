    "abstract": "We apply the QCD sum rule method to study the double-gluon hybrid states with the quark-gluon contents $\\bar q q gg$ ($q=u/d$) and $\\bar s s gg$. We construct twenty-eight double-gluon hybrid currents, eleven of which are found to be zero due to some internal symmetries between the two gluons fields. We concentrate on the non-vanishing currents with the exotic quantum numbers $J^{PC} = 1^{-+}$ and $3^{-+}$. Their masses are calculated to be $M_{|\\bar q q gg;1^{-+}\\rangle} = 4.35^{+0.26}_{-0.30}$ GeV, $M_{|\\bar s s gg;1^{-+}\\rangle} = 4.49^{+0.25}_{-0.30}$ GeV, $M_{|\\bar q q gg;3^{-+}\\rangle} = 3.02^{+0.24}_{-0.31}$ GeV, and $M_{|\\bar s s gg;3^{-+}\\rangle} = 3.16^{+0.22}_{-0.28}$ GeV. The decay behaviors of the $J^{PC} = 3^{-+}$ states are studied, and we propose to search for them in the $πa_1(1260)/ρω/φφ$ channels in future particle experiments.",

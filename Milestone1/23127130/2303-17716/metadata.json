    "abstract": "We consider the problem of online multiclass learning when the number of labels is unbounded. We show that the Multiclass Littlestone dimension, first introduced in \\cite{DanielyERMprinciple}, continues to characterize online learnability in this setting. Our result complements the recent work by \\cite{Brukhimetal2022} who give a characterization of batch multiclass learnability when the label space is unbounded.",

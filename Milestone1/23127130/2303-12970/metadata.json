    "abstract": "The global pandemic COVID-19 posed numerous challenges for U.S. restaurants and food services. Many businesses adopted contactless ordering and cashless payment policies to comply with emergency health mandates. Even with national and public health emergency mandates set to expire in May 2023, cashless payment services continue to thrive through online ordering platforms such as DoorDash and Uber Eats and social payment platforms such as Snackpass. At present, designers and policymakers must address the socioeconomic politics of cashless payment services and service accessibility for marginalized groups.",

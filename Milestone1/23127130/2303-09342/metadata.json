    "abstract": "Pursuit of superconductivity in light-element systems at ambient pressure is of great experimental and theoretical interest. In this work, we combine a machine learning (ML) method with first-principles calculations to efficiently search for the energetically favorable ternary Ca-B-C compounds. Three new layered borocarbides (stable CaBC5 and metastable Ca2BC11 and CaB3C3) are predicted to be phonon-mediated superconductors at ambient pressure. The hexagonal CaB3C3 possesses the highest Tc of 26.05 K among the three compounds. The σ-bonging bands around the Fermi level account for the large electron-phonon coupling (λ = 0.980) of hexagonal CaB3C3. The ML-guided approach opens up a way for greatly accelerating the discovery of new high-Tc superconductors.",

This simulation investigates how a large scale vertical field evolves within a turbulent accretion disk and whether global magnetic field configurations suitable for launching jets and winds can develop. We find that a “coronal mechanism” of magnetic flux motion, which operates largely outside the disk body, dominates global flux evolution. In this mechanism, magnetic stresses driven by orbital shear create large-scale half-loops of magnetic field that stretch radially inward and then reconnect, leading to discontinuous jumps in the location of magnetic flux. In contrast, little or no flux is brought in directly by accretion within the disk itself. The coronal mechanism establishes a dipole magnetic field in the evacuated funnel around the orbital axis with a field intensity regulated by a combination of the magnetic and gas pressures in the inner disk. These results prompt a reevaluation of previous descriptions of magnetic flux motion associated with accretion. Local pictures are undercut by the intrinsically global character of magnetic flux. Formulations in terms of an “effective viscosity” competing with an “effective resistivity” are undermined by the nonlinearity of of the magnetic dynamics and the fact that the same turbulence driving mass motion (traditionally identified as “viscosity”) can alter magnetic topology.}, journal={The Astrophysical Journal}, author={Beckwith, Kris and Hawley, John F. and Krolik, Julian H.}, year={2009}, pages={428} }

In the previous models of protostellar flares, the interaction between a protostellar magnetosphere with the surrounding disk plays crucial roles in building-up and releasing the magnetic energy. However, it remains unclear if protostars indeed have magnetospheres because vigorous disk accretion and strong disk magnetic fields in the protostellar phase may destroy the magnetosphere. Considering this possibility, we investigate the energy accumulation and release processes in the absence of a magnetosphere using a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulation. Our simulation reveals that protostellar flares are repeatedly produced even in such a case. Unlike in the magnetospheric models, the protostar accumulates magnetic energy by acquiring large-scale magnetic fields from the disk by accretion. Protostellar flares occur when a portion of the large-scale magnetic fields are removed from the protostar as a result of magnetic reconnection. Protostellar flares in the simulation are consistent with observations; the released magnetic energy (up to $sim 3times 10^{38}$ erg) is large enough to drive observed flares, and the flares produce hot ejecta. The expelled magnetic fields enhance accretion, and the energy build-up and release processes are repeated as a result. The magnetic flux removal via reconnection leads to redistribution of magnetic fields in the inner disk. We therefore consider that protostellar flares will play an important role in the evolution of the disk magnetic fields in the vicinity of protostars.}, number={1}, journal={The Astrophysical Journal}, author={Takasao, Shinsuke and Tomida, Kengo and Iwasaki, Kazunari and Suzuki, Takeru K}, year={2019}, pages={L10} }

We perform the simulations in the spherical coordinates with different temperature profiles and accordingly different rotation profiles. In the cases with a spatially constant temperature, because the rotation frequency is vertically constant in the equilibrium condition, general properties of the turbulence are quantitatively similar to those obtained in local shearing box simulations. On the other hand, in the cases with a radially variable temperature profile, the vertical differential rotation, which is inevitable in the equilibrium condition, winds up the magnetic field lines, in addition to the usual radial differential rotation. As a result, the coherent wound magnetic fields contribute to the Maxwell stress in the surface regions. We obtain nondimensional density and velocity fluctuations $sim$0.1-0.2 at the midplane. The azimuthal power spectra of the magnetic fields show shallow slopes, $sim$m^0- m^-1, than those of velocity and density. We observe intermittent and structured disk winds driven by the Poynting flux associated with the MHD turbulence. The Poynting flux originating from magnetic tension is injected from the regions above a scale height towards both the midplane and the surfaces. Related to this, sound waves are directed to the midplane from the surface regions. The mass accretion mainly occurs near the surfaces and the gas near the midplane slowly moves outward, which causes large-scale meridional circulations. The vertical magnetic fields are also dragged inward in the surface regions, while they stochastically move outward and inward around the midplane. We also discuss an observational implication of induced spiral structure in the simulated turbulent disks to protoplanetary disks.}, journal={The Astrophysical Journal}, author={Suzuki, Takeru K. and Inutsuka, Shuichiro}, year={2014}, pages={121} }

  abstract = "It is widely believed that T Tauri winds are driven
              magnetocentrifugally from accretion disks close to the central
              stars. The exact launching conditions are uncertain. We show that
              a general relation exists between the poloidal and toroidal
              velocity components of a magnetocentrifugal wind at large
              distances and the rotation rate of the launching surface,
              independent of the uncertain launching conditions. We discuss the
              physical basis of this relation and verify it by using a set of
              numerically determined large-scale wind solutions. Both velocity
              components are in principle measurable from spatially resolved
              spectra, as has been done for the extended low-velocity component
              (LVC) of the DG Tauri wind by Bacciotti et al. For this
              particular source, we infer that the spatially resolved LVC
              originates from a region on the disk extending from ~0.3 to ~4.0
              AU from the star, which is consistent with, and a refinement
              over, the rough estimate of Bacciotti et al.",

abstract="As black holes accrete gas, they often produce relativistic, collimated outflows, or jets. Jets are expected to form in the vicinity of a black hole, making them powerful probes of strong-field gravity. However, how jet properties (e.g., jet power) connect to those of the accretion flow (e.g., mass accretion rate) and the black hole (e.g., black hole spin) remains an area of active research. This is because what determines a crucial parameter that controls jet properties---the strength of large-scale magnetic flux threading the black hole---remains largely unknown. First-principles computer simulations show that due to this, even if black hole spin and mass accretion rate are held constant, the simulated jet powers span a wide range, with no clear winner. This limits our ability to use jets as a quantitative diagnostic tool of accreting black holes. Recent advances in computer simulations demonstrated that accretion disks can accumulate large-scale magnetic flux on the black hole, until the magnetic flux becomes so strong that it obstructs gas infall and leads to a magnetically-arrested disk (MAD). Recent evidence suggests that central black holes in jetted active galactic nuclei and tidal disruptions are surrounded by MADs. Since in MADs both the black hole magnetic flux and the jet power are at their maximum, well-defined values, this opens up a new vista in the measurements of black hole masses and spins and quantitative tests of accretion and jet theory.",

It is intended primarily for applications in astrophysical fluid dynamics, but its flexible and modular design enables its use for a wide variety of physics. The framework works with both uniform and nonuniform grids in Cartesian and curvilinear coordinate systems. It adopts a dynamic execution model based on a simple design called a “task list” that improves parallel performance by overlapping communication and computation, simplifies the inclusion of a diverse range of physics, and even enables multiphysics models involving different physics in different regions of the calculation. We describe physics modules implemented in this framework for both non-relativistic and relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). These modules adopt mature and robust algorithms originally developed for the Athena MHD code and incorporate new extensions: support for curvilinear coordinates, higher-order time integrators, more realistic physics such as a general equation of state, and diffusion terms that can be integrated with super-time-stepping algorithms. The modules show excellent performance and scaling, with well over 80\% parallel efficiency on over half a million threads.

Here, we investigate the combined effect of gas angular momentum and radiation feedback on the accretion flow, by performing 2D axially symmetric radiation hydrodynamics simulations that solve the flow structure across the Bondi radius and the outer part of the accretion disc simultaneously. The accreting gas with finite angular momentum forms a rotationally-supported disc inside the Bondi radius, where the accretion proceeds by the angular momentum transport due to assumed alpha-type viscosity. We find that the interplay of radiation and angular momentum significantly suppresses accretion even if the radiative feedback is weakened in an equatorial shadowing region. The accretion rate is O(alpha)sim O(0.01-0.1) times the Bondi value, where alpha is the viscosity parameter. By developing an analytical model, we show that such a great reduction of the accretion rate persists unless the angular momentum is so small that the corresponding centrifugal radius is lesssim 0.04 times the Bondi radius. We argue that BHs are hard to grow quickly via rapid mass accretion considering the angular momentum barrier presented in this paper.}, number={3}, journal={Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society}, author={Sugimura, Kazuyuki and Hosokawa, Takashi and Yajima, Hidenobu and Inayoshi, Kohei and Omukai, Kazuyuki}, year={2018}, pages={3961–3975} }

A local shearing box is used for our numerical analysis and the simulations begin with a purely vertical magnetic field. We find that the magnetic stress in the nonlinear stage of the MRI is strongly fluctuating. The time evolution shows the quasi-periodic recurrence of spike-shape variations typically for a few orbits which correspond to the rapid amplification of the magnetic field by the nonlinear growth of a two-channel solution followed by the decay through magnetic reconnections. The increase rate of the total energy in the shearing box system is analytically related to the volume-averaged torque in the system. We find that at the saturated state this energy gain of the system is balanced with the increase of the thermal energy mostly due to the joule heating. The spike-shape time evolution is a general feature of the nonlinear evolution of the MRI in the disks threaded by vertical fields and can be seen if the effective magnetic Reynolds number is larger than about unity.}, number={2}, journal={The Astrophysical Journal}, author={Sano, Takayoshi and Inutsuka, Shu-ichiro}, year={2001}, pages={L179–L182} }

Three-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling of the ISM (Wada & Norman 2002) with the nuclear starburst now includes tracking of the formation of molecular hydrogen out of the neutral hydrogen phase. In a quasi equilibrium state, mass fraction of H2 is about 0.4 (total H2 mass is ~1.5 10^6 Msun) of the total gas mass for the uniform far UV (FUV) with G_0 = 10. The gas forms an inhomogeneous disk, whose scale-height becomes larger in the outer region. H2 forms a thin nuclear disk in the inner ~ 5 pc, which is surrounded by molecular clouds swelled up toward h < 10 pc. The velocity field of the disk is highly turbulent in the torus region, whose velocity dispersion is ~ 20 km/s on average. Average supernova rate (SNR) of ~ 5 10^-5/yr is large enough to energize these structures. Gas column densities toward the nucleus larger than 10^22 cm^-2 are observed if the viewing angle is smaller than theta_v ~ 50 deg from the edge-on. However, the column densities are distributed over almost two orders of magnitude around the average for any given viewing angle due to the clumpy nature of the torus. For a stronger FUV (G_0 =100), the total H2 mass in an equillibrium is only slightly smaller (~ 0.35). Finally the morphology and kinematics of the circumnuclear molecular gas disks emerging from our models is similar to that revealed by recent near infrared observations using VLTI/Keck.}, number={1}, journal={The Astrophysical Journal}, author={Wada, Keiichi and Papadopoulos, Padeli P and Spaans, Marco}, year={2009}, pages={63–74} }

                   is considered as a sign of active galactic nucleus (AGN)
                   feedback in action. However, the physical mechanism
                   responsible for driving the observed outflows remains
                   unclear, and whether it is due to momentum, energy, or
                   radiation is still a matter of debate. The observed outflow
                   energetics, in particular the large measured values of the
                   momentum ratio ($\dot\{p\}/(L/c) \sim 10$) and energy ratio
                   ($\dot\{E\}_k/L \sim 0.05$), seems to favour the
                   energy-driving mechanism; and most observational works have
                   focused their comparison with wind energy-driven models.
                   Here we show that AGN radiation pressure on dust can
                   adequately reproduce the observed outflow energetics (mass
                   outflow rate, momentum flux, and kinetic power), as well as
                   the scalings with luminosity, provided that the effects of
                   radiation trapping are properly taken into account. In
                   particular, we predict a sub-linear scaling for the mass
                   outflow rate ($\dot\{M\} \propto L^\{1/2\}$) and a
                   super-linear scaling for the kinetic power ($\dot\{E\}_k
                   \propto L^\{3/2\}$), in agreement with the observational
                   scaling relations reported in the most recent compilation of
                   AGN outflow data. We conclude that AGN radiative feedback
                   can account for the global outflow energetics, at least
                   equally well as the wind energy-driving mechanism, and
                   therefore both physical models should be considered in the
                   interpretation of future AGN outflow observations.",

                   open questions about warm absorbers: where do they
                   originate, what effect do they have on their host galaxies,
                   and what is their importance within the energetics and
                   dynamics of the AGN system as a whole? We find that the warm
                   absorbers of nearby Seyferts and certain QSOs are most
                   likely to originate in outflows from the dusty torus, and

                   well under 1\% of the bolometric luminosities of the AGN.
                   Our analysis supports, however, the view that the
                   relativistic outflows recently observed in two PG quasars

                   These slow velocities imply a large launch radius, pointing
                   to the broad line region and/or torus as the origin of this
                   material. Thermal driving was originally suggested as a
                   plausible mechanism for launching this material but recent
                   work has focused instead on magnetic winds, unifying these
                   slow, mildly ionised winds with the more highly ionised
                   ultra-fast outflows. Here we use the recently developed

                   study of a sample of 20 Compton-thin type II galaxies using
                   broad band spectra from XMM-Newton, Chandra, and Suzaku. The
                   aim is to study the variability of the neutral intrinsic
                   X-ray obscuration along the line of sight and investigate
                   the properties and location of the dominant component of the
                   X-ray-obscuring gas. The observations are sensitive to
                   absorption columns of $N_\{\rm H\} \sim 10^\{20.5-24\} \{\rm
                   cm^\{-2\}\}$ of fully- and partially-covering neutral and/or
                   lowly-ionized gas on timescales spanning days to well over a
                   decade. We detected variability in the column density of the
                   full-covering absorber in 7/20 sources, on timescales of
                   months-years, indicating a component of compact-scale
                   X-ray-obscuring gas lying along the line of sight of each of
                   these objects. Our results imply that torus models
                   incorporating clouds or overdense regions should account for
                   line of sight column densities as low as $\sim$ a few
                   $\times 10^\{21\}$ cm$^\{-2\}$. However, 13/20 sources
                   yielded no detection of significant variability in the
                   full-covering obscurer, with upper limits to
                   $\{\Delta\}N_\{\rm H\}$ spanning $10^\{21-23\}$ cm$^\{-2\}$.
                   The dominant absorbing media in these systems could be
                   distant, such as kpc-scale dusty structures associated with
                   the host galaxy, or a homogeneous medium along the line of
                   sight. Thus, we find that overall, strong variability in
                   full-covering obscurers is not highly prevalent in
                   Compton-thin type IIs, at least for our sample, in contrast
                   to previous results in the literature. Finally, 11/20
                   sources required a partial-covering, obscuring component in
                   all or some of their observations, consistent with clumpy
                   near-Compton-thick compact-scale gas.",

                   in fuelling the growth of supermassive black holes. However,
                   observational support for this hypothesis is mixed, with
                   some studies showing a correlation between merging galaxies
                   and luminous quasars and others showing no such association.
                   Recent observations have shown that a black hole is likely
                   to become heavily obscured behind merger-driven gas and
                   dust, even in the early stages of the merger, when the
                   galaxies are well separated (5 to 40 kiloparsecs). Merger
                   simulations further suggest that such obscuration and
                   black-hole accretion peaks in the final merger stage, when
                   the two galactic nuclei are closely separated (less than 3
                   kiloparsecs). Resolving this final stage requires a
                   combination of high-spatial-resolution infrared imaging and
                   high-sensitivity hard-X-ray observations to detect highly
                   obscured sources. However, large numbers of obscured
                   luminous accreting supermassive black holes have been
                   recently detected nearby (distances below 250 megaparsecs)
                   in X-ray observations. Here we report high-resolution
                   infrared observations of hard-X-ray-selected black holes and
                   the discovery of obscured nuclear mergers, the parent
                   populations of supermassive-black-hole mergers. We find that
                   obscured luminous black holes (bolometric luminosity higher
                   than 2x10^44 ergs per second) show a significant (P<0.001)
                   excess of late-stage nuclear mergers (17.6 per cent)
                   compared to a sample of inactive galaxies with matching
                   stellar masses and star formation rates (1.1 per cent), in
                   agreement with theoretical predictions. Using hydrodynamic
                   simulations, we confirm that the excess of nuclear mergers
                   is indeed strongest for gas-rich major-merger hosts of
                   obscured luminous black holes in this final stage.",

                   However, direct observational evidence that AGN feedback
                   causes quenching on a population scale is lacking. Studies
                   have shown that luminous AGN are preferentially located in
                   gas-rich and star-forming galaxies, an observation that has
                   sometimes been suggested to be in tension with a negative
                   AGN feedback picture. We investigate three of the current
                   cosmological simulations (IllustrisTNG, EAGLE and SIMBA)
                   along with post-processed models for molecular hydrogen gas
                   masses and perform similar tests to those used by observers.
                   We find that the simulations predict: (i) no strong negative
                   trends between AGN luminosity and molecular gas fraction or
                   sSFR; (ii) both high-luminosity ($L_\{bol\}>10^\{44\}$

                   preferentially located in galaxies with high molecular gas

                   quenched fractions of AGN host galaxies are lower than a
                   control sample of non-active galaxies. These three findings

               beginning to allow reconstruction of echo images (or
               velocity-delay maps) that encode information about the structure
               and kinematics of the broad line region (BLR) in active galactic
               nuclei (AGNs). Such maps can constrain sophisticated physical
               models for the BLR. The physical picture of the BLR is often
               theorized to be a photoionized wind launched from the AGN
               accretion disk. Previously we showed that the line-driven disk
               wind solution found in an earlier simulation by Proga and
               Kallman is virialized over a large distance from the disk. This
               finding implies that, according to this model, black hole masses
               can be reliably estimated through reverberation mapping
               techniques. However, predictions of echo images expected from
               line-driven disk winds are not available. Here, after presenting
               the necessary radiative transfer methodology, we carry out the
               first calculations of such predictions. We find that the echo
               images are quite similar to other virialized BLR models such as
               randomly orbiting clouds and thin Keplerian disks. We conduct a
               parameter survey exploring how echo images, line profiles, and
               transfer functions depend on both the inclination angle and the
               line opacity. We find that the line profiles are almost always
               single peaked, while transfer functions tend to have tails
               extending to large time delays. The outflow, despite being
               primarily equatorially directed, causes an appreciable
               blueshifted excess on both the echo image and line profile when
               seen from lower inclinations (). This effect may be observable

                   rotational component at projected distances $\leq$ 10$``$

              sample of 26 Seyfert galaxies observed with XMM-Newton. Our goal
              is to characterise warm absorbers (WAs) along the line-of-sight
              to the active nucleus. We significantly detect WAs in 65\% of the
              sample sources. Our results are consistent with WAs being present
              in at least half of the Seyfert galaxies in the nearby Universe,
              in agreement with previous estimates. We find a gap in the
              distribution of the ionisation parameter in the range 0.5 < log
              $\xi$ < 1.5 which we interpret as a thermally unstable region for
              WA clouds. This may indicate that the warm absorber flow is
              probably constituted by a clumpy distribution of discrete clouds

              column densities for the sources with broad Fe K$\alpha$ lines

              are bonafide and not artifacts of ionised absorption in the soft

              commonly referred to as the ``torus.'' While molecular lines show
              the presence of large, massive disks, the IR observations appear
              to be dominated by a strong polar component that has been
              interpreted as a dusty wind. This paper aims at using
              characteristics shared by AGN in each of the wavebands and a set
              of simple physical principles to form a unifying view of these
              seemingly contradictory observations: Dusty molecular gas flows
              in from galactic scales of ~100 pc to the sub-parsec environment
              via a disk with small to moderate scale height. The hot, inner

              unbinds a large amount of the inflowing gas from the black hole's
              gravitational potential, providing the conditions to launch a
              wind driven by the radiation pressure from the AGN. The dusty
              wind feeds back mass into the galaxy at a rate of the order of
              ~0.1-100 $M_\odot$/yr, depending on AGN luminosity and Eddington

              the clouds will be destroyed before they can reach the high

              outflow. We present a series of hydro-chemical simulations of an
              isotropic AGN wind interacting with a uniform medium. We follow
              the time-dependent chemistry of 157 species, including 20
              molecules, to determine whether molecules can form rapidly enough
              to produce the observed molecular outflows. We find H$_2$ outflow
              rates up to 140 M$_\odot$ yr$^\{-1\}$, which is sensitive to
              density, AGN luminosity, and metallicity. We compute emission and
              absorption lines of CO, OH and warm (a few hundred to a few
              thousand K) H$_2$ from the simulations in post-processing. The

  abstract = "Active galactic nuclei (AGN) drive fast winds in the interstellar
              medium of their host galaxies. It is commonly assumed that the
              high ambient densities and intense radiation fields in galactic
              nuclei imply short cooling times, thus making the outflows
              momentum-conserving. We show that cooling of high-velocity,
              shocked winds in AGN is in fact inefficient in a wide range of
              circumstances, including conditions relevant to ultra-luminous
              infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), resulting in energy-conserving
              outflows. We further show that fast energy-conserving outflows
              can tolerate a large amount of mixing with cooler gas before
              radiative losses become important. For winds with initial
              velocity v\_in>~10,000 km s^-1, as observed in ultra-violet and
              X-ray absorption, the shocked wind develops a two-temperature
              structure. While most of the thermal pressure support is provided
              by the protons, the cooling processes operate directly only on
              the electrons. This significantly slows down inverse Compton
              cooling, while free free cooling is negligible. Slower winds with
              v\_in~1,000 km s^-1, such as may be driven by radiation pressure
              on dust, can also experience energy-conserving phases but under
              more restrictive conditions. During the energy-conserving phase,
              the momentum flux of an outflow is boosted by a factor
              ~v\_in/2v\_s by work done by the hot post-shock gas, where v\_s
              is the velocity of the swept-up material. Energy-conserving
              outflows driven by fast AGN winds (v\_in~0.1c) may therefore
              explain the momentum fluxes Pdot>>L\_AGN/c of galaxy-scale
              outflows recently measured in luminous quasars and ULIRGs.
              Shocked wind bubbles expanding normal to galactic disks may also
              explain the large-scale bipolar structures observed in some
              systems, including around the Galactic Center, and can produce
              significant radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray emission. [Abridged]",

              accelerated to an asymptotic velocity of v\_inf ~ v\_esc, where
              v\_esc is the escape velocity from the central source. We note
              that this is not the case for dusty shells. Instead, if the shell
              is initially optically-thick to the UV emission from the source
              of luminosity L, then there is a significant boost in v\_inf that
              reflects the integral of the momentum absorbed by the shell as it
              is accelerated. For shells reaching a generalized Eddington
              limit, we show that v\_inf ~ (4 R\_UV L / M\_sh c)^\{1/2\}, in
              both point-mass and isothermal-sphere potentials, where R\_UV is
              the radius where the shell becomes optically-thin to UV photons,
              and M\_sh is the mass of the shell. The asymptotic velocity
              significantly exceeds v\_esc for typical parameters, and can
              explain the ~1000-2000 km/s outflows observed from rapidly
              star-forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei if their
              geometry is shell-like and if the surrounding halo has low gas
              density. Similarly fast shells from massive stars can be
              accelerated on ~ few -1000 yr timescales. We further consider the

              circumgalactic medium. We calculate the ``momentum ratio'' Mdot v

                   reprocessing in the circumnuclear material, based on a
                   simple, uniform-density torus X-ray reprocessing model, we
                   find a covering factor of 80-100\% and a globally averaged
                   column density in the range (1-2) x 10^23 cm^-2. This
                   closely matches the independently measured variable

                   straightforward and self-consistent picture of the obscuring

                   with measurements of spatially resolved sub-parsec
                   absorption from radio observations, we find that it may be

                   torus model featuring a steep density gradient along the
                   axis of the relativistic jets. This provides a valuable

                   that the active galactic nucleus (AGN) is not located at the

                   distance of $1.75$ $\pm$ $0.22$ arcsec ($139 \pm 17$ pc).
                   This is probably caused by the high interstellar extinction
                   in the surroundings of the AGN, which corresponds to the
                   true nucleus of the galaxy, as also proposed by previous
                   studies. The morphology and classification of the optical

                   the observer (the AGN is actually Compton thick), mostly
                   caused by a nearly edge-on torus. An additional hypothesis

              (WA) in X-rays carried out using high-resolution grating spectral
              data from XMM-Newton satellite (WAX-I). Here we discuss the
              global dynamical properties as well as the energetics of the WA
              components detected in the WAX sample. The slope of WA density
              profile (n ∝ r-$\alpha$) estimated from the linear regression
              slope of ionization parameter $\xi$ and column density NH in the
              WAX sample is $\alpha$ = 1.236 $\pm$ 0.034. We find that the WA
              clouds possibly originate as a result of photoionized evaporation
              from the inner edge of the torus (torus wind). They can also
              originate in the cooling front of the shock generated by faster
              accretion disc outflows, the ultrafast outflows, impinging on to
              the interstellar medium or the torus. The acceleration mechanism
              for the WA is complex and neither radiatively driven wind nor
              MHD-driven wind scenario alone can describe the outflow
              acceleration. However, we find that radiative forces play a
              significant role in accelerating the WA through the soft X-ray
              absorption lines, and also with dust opacity. Given the large
              uncertainties in the distance and volume filling factor estimates
              of the WA, we conclude that the kinetic luminosity {\.E}K of WA
              may sometimes be large enough to yield significant feedback to
              the host galaxy. We find that the lowest ionization states carry
              the maximum mass outflow, and the sources with higher Fe M UTA
              absorption (15-17 {\AA}) have more mass outflow rates.",

                   Active Galaxies, but the mechanism of creating a medium able
                   to emit these intense lines is not quite clear. Observations
                   clearly indicate that the motion of the material is
                   predominantly Keplerian, with traces of inflow and clear
                   signatures of outflow, but this still does not point out
                   whether the lines partially come from the disk surface, or
                   exclusively from the circumnuclear material, and whether
                   this material originates from the disk as a wind, or comes,
                   at least partially, from outside. I review the basic
                   scenarios for the formation of the Broad Line Region (BLR),

                   is a universal number fixed by the radiation pressure

                   active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are usually at the order of
                   years to tens of years (some of them are even shorter than
                   one year), which are much shorter than the viscous timescale
                   of a standard thin accretion disk. It implies that the
                   variabilities of CL AGNs cannot be reproduced by varying the
                   mass accretion rate of the thin disk. In this work, we
                   employ a magnetic accretion disk-outflow model to calculate
                   the inflow time of the disk predominantly driven by magnetic
                   outflows. In this model, most angular momentum of the gas in
                   the disk is carried away by the outflows, and therefore its
                   radial velocity can be substantially higher than that of a
                   conventional viscous disk. Our calculations show that the
                   inflow time of such a disk with outflows can be around
                   several years to tens years. The calculated spectra of the

                   derived inflow time of such a disk with outflows is around 5
                   years in the high state, while it becomes $\sim 20$ years in
                   the low state, which is roughly consistent with the

                   large parameter space of initial conditions and formulate an
                   analytical model for the accretion. Contrary to the case
                   without radiation feedback, the accretion rate increases
                   with increasing BH velocity $\vbh$ reaching a maximum value
                   at $\vbh=2c_\{\rm s,in\}\sim 50$ km/s, where $c_\{\rm
                   s,in\}$ is the sound speed inside the ``cometary-shaped''
                   \textbackslashhii region around the BH, before decreasing as

                   R\}-type (rarefied) and the accretion rate approaches the
                   classical Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton solution. The increase of
                   the accretion rate with $\vbh$ is produced by the formation
                   of a \{\textbackslashit D\}-type (dense) ionization front
                   (I-front) preceded by a standing bow-shock that reduces the

                   significantly increase the detectability of intermediate
                   mass BHs. We find that the mean accretion rate for a moving

  abstract      = "In this paper we focus on understanding the physical
                   processes that lead to stable or unstable ionization fronts
                   (I-fronts) observed in simulations of moving black holes
                   (BHs). The front instability may trigger bursts of gas
                   accretion, rendering the BH significantly more luminous than
                   at steady-state. We perform a series of idealized three
                   dimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations resolving
                   the I-fronts around BHs of mass $M_\mathrm\{BH\}$ and
                   velocity $v_\infty$ accreting from a medium of density
                   $n_\mathrm\{H\}$. The I-front, with radius $R_\mathrm\{I\}$,
                   transitions from D-type to R-type as the BH velocity becomes
                   larger than a critical value $v_\mathrm\{R\}\sim
                   40\,\mathrm\{km/s\}$. The D-type front is preceded by a
                   bow-shock of thickness $\Delta R_\mathrm\{I\}$ that
                   decreases as $v_\infty$ approaches $v_\mathrm\{R\}$. We find
                   that both D-type and R-type fronts can be unstable given the
                   following two conditions: i) for D-type fronts the shell
                   thickness must be $\Delta R_\mathrm\{I\}/R_\mathrm\{I\}3$.
                   This second condition is satisfied if
                   $T_\mathrm\{I\}<5000\,\mathrm\{K\}$ or if
                   $n_\mathrm\{H\}\,M_\mathrm\{BH\} \gtrsim
                   10^6\,M_\odot\,\mathrm\{cm^\{-3\}\}$. Due to X-ray
                   pre-heating typically $T_\mathrm\{I\} \sim
                   10^4\,\mathrm\{K\}$, unless the D-type shell is optically
                   thick to X-rays, which also happens when
                   $n_\mathrm\{H\}\,M_\mathrm\{BH\}$ is greater than a
                   metallicity-dependent critical value. We thus conclude that
                   I-fronts around BHs are unstable only for relatively massive
                   BHs moving trough very dense molecular clouds. We briefly
                   discuss the observational consequences of the X-ray
                   luminosity bursts likely associated with this instability.",

              magnetocentrifugally from accretion disks close to the central
              stars. The exact launching conditions are uncertain. We show that
              a general relation exists between the poloidal and toroidal
              velocity components of a magnetocentrifugal wind at large
              distances and the rotation rate of the launching surface,

              physical basis of this relation and verify it by using a set of
              numerically determined large-scale wind solutions. Both velocity
              components are in principle measurable from spatially resolved
              spectra, as has been done for the extended low-velocity component
              (LVC) of the DG Tauri wind by Bacciotti et al. For this

                   Known to be formed either in-situ with an intrinsically low

                   intermediate-mass black hole (BH) could help discriminate
                   between these possible scenarios. With this aim, we have
                   performed a multiwavelength search of active BH activity,
                   i.e. active galactic nuclei (AGN), in a sample of 937
                   low-mass compact galaxies (580 UCDs and 357 cEs). This
                   constitutes the largest study of AGN activity in these types
                   of galaxies. Based on their X-ray luminosity, radio
                   luminosity and morphology, and/or optical emission line
                   diagnostic diagrams, we find a total of 11 cEs that host an
                   AGN. We also study for the first time the location of both

                   hosting AGN on the BH-galaxy scaling relations, finding that

                   with available BH mass measurements for some of the low-mass

                   scatter seen at the low-mass end of the BH-galaxy scaling

                   explained solely by this scatter, and thus our results

                   responsible for driving the observed outflows remains
                   unclear, and whether it is due to momentum, energy, or
                   radiation is still a matter of debate. The observed outflow
                   energetics, in particular the large measured values of the
                   momentum ratio ($\dot\{p\}/(L/c) \sim 10$) and energy ratio
                   ($\dot\{E\}_k/L \sim 0.05$), seems to favour the
                   energy-driving mechanism; and most observational works have
                   focused their comparison with wind energy-driven models.
                   Here we show that AGN radiation pressure on dust can
                   adequately reproduce the observed outflow energetics (mass
                   outflow rate, momentum flux, and kinetic power), as well as
                   the scalings with luminosity, provided that the effects of
                   radiation trapping are properly taken into account. In
                   particular, we predict a sub-linear scaling for the mass
                   outflow rate ($\dot\{M\} \propto L^\{1/2\}$) and a
                   super-linear scaling for the kinetic power ($\dot\{E\}_k
                   \propto L^\{3/2\}$), in agreement with the observational
                   scaling relations reported in the most recent compilation of
                   AGN outflow data. We conclude that AGN radiative feedback
                   can account for the global outflow energetics, at least
                   equally well as the wind energy-driving mechanism, and
                   therefore both physical models should be considered in the

                   accretion rate, becoming X-ray weaker (and hence more disc
                   dominated) at higher Eddington ratio. These models allow us
                   to predict the launch radius, velocity, column density and
                   ionisation state of thermal winds as well as the mass loss

                   months-years, indicating a component of compact-scale
                   X-ray-obscuring gas lying along the line of sight of each of

                   improved our understanding of the nature of these outflowing

                   provide rare insights into the dynamics and nature of matter

                   resolution ($\le 0.5$ eV at $1$ keV) observations will be

                   important information about outflow structures and their

                   will be required to study the outflows in distant quasars,
                   particularly at the quasar peak era (redshift $1\le z\le 3$)

                   thick disk with a radial distribution of clouds peaking in
                   the inner region. In our BLR model the physical mean radius

                   would be measured, which matches very well the 10 day time
                   lag that has been measured by reverberation mapping. We
                   measure a hot dust FWHM size of 0.74 mas (0.14 pc) and
                   further reconstruct an image of the hot dust which reveals a
                   faint (5\% of the total flux) offset cloud which we

                   find a FWHM size of 2.2 mas (0.4 pc), fully in line with the

                   find that the AGN luminosity correlates with both the CO
                   luminosity and black hole mass, suggesting that AGN activity
                   is loosely coupled to the cold gas reservoir of the host.
                   The observed strong correlation between host galaxy total
                   infrared luminosity and AGN luminosity arises from their
                   common dependence on the molecular gas. We argue that the
                   total infrared luminosity, at least for low-redshift
                   quasars, can be used to derive reliable star formation rates

                   quasars have molecular gas content similar to that of
                   star-forming galaxies of comparable stellar mass. Moreover,
                   they share similar gas kinematics, as evidenced by their CO
                   Tully-Fisher relation and the absence of detectable
                   molecular outflows down to sensitive limits. There is no
                   sign that AGN feedback quenches star formation for the
                   quasars in our sample. On the contrary, the abundant gas
                   supply forms stars prodigiously, at a rate that places most
                   of them above the star-forming main sequence and with an
                   efficiency that rivals that of starburst systems.",

                   with the gas in the galactic disc and may be able to drive
                   large-scale, multiphase outflows. We apply our novel
                   sub-grid model for Blandford-Znajek jets to simulations of
                   the central regions of Seyferts, in which a black hole is
                   embedded in a dense, circumnuclear disc (CND) and surrounded
                   by a dilute circumgalactic medium (CGM). We find that the
                   variability of the accretion flow is highly sensitive both
                   to the jet power and to the CND thermodynamics and,
                   ultimately, is determined by the complex interplay between
                   jet-driven outflows and backflows. Even at moderate
                   Eddington ratios, AGN jets are able to significantly alter
                   the thermodynamics and kinematics of CNDs and entrain up to
                   10\% of their mass in the outflow. Mass outflow rates and
                   kinetic powers of the warm outflowing component are in
                   agreement with recent observations for black holes with
                   similar bolometric luminosities, with outflow velocities
                   that are able to reach 500 km/s. Depending on their power
                   and direction, jets are able to drive a wide variety of

                   structures to highly mass-loaded, multiphase, bipolar winds.

               gaseous envelope collapsing onto a black hole (BH). We consider
               gas with such small angular momentum that, after an initial
               transient, the flow in the HD case accretes directly onto a BH
               without forming a rotationally supported torus. However, in the
               MHD case, even with a very weak initial magnetic field, the flow
               settles into a configuration with four components: (1) an
               equatorial inflow, (2) a bipolar outflow, (3) polar funnel
               outflow, and (4) polar funnel inflow. We focus our analysis on
               the second flow component of the MHD flow, which represents a
               simple yet robust example of a well-organized inflow/outflow
               solution to the problem of MHD jet formation. The jet is heavy,
               highly magnetized, and driven by magnetic and centrifugal
               forces. A significant fraction of the total energy in the jet is
               carried out by a large-scale magnetic field. We review previous
               simulations, in which specific angular momentum was higher than
               that assumed here, and conclude that our bipolar outflow
               develops for a wide range of the properties of the flow near the
               equator and near the poles. Future work on such a simple
               inflow/outflow solution will help to pinpoint the key elements

              \& Proga, where we investigated the $\gamma$ dependence of
              two-dimensional Bondi-like accretion flows in the hydrodynamical
              (HD) limit. Our main goal is to study if simulations for various
              $\gamma$ can give us insights into the problem of various modes
              of accretion observed in several types of accretion systems, such
              as black hole binaries (BHBs), active galactic nuclei (AGN) and
              gamma-ray bursts. We find that for $\gamma$ >~ 4/3, the
              fast-rotating flow forms a thick torus that is supported by
              rotation and gas pressure. As shown before for $\gamma$ = 5/3,
              such a torus produces a strong, persistent bipolar outflow that
              can significantly reduce the polar funnel accretion of a slowly
              rotating flow. For low $\gamma$, close to 1, the torus is thin
              and is supported by rotation. The thin torus produces an unsteady
              outflow which is too weak to propagate throughout the polar
              funnel inflow. Compared to their HD counterparts, the MHD
              simulations show that the magnetized torus can produce an outflow
              and does not exhibit regular oscillations. Generally, our
              simulations demonstrate how the torus thickness affects the
              outflow production. They also support the notion that the
              geometrical thickness of the torus correlates with the power of
              the torus outflow. Our results, applied to observations, suggest
              that the torus ability to radiatively cool and become thin can
              correspond to a suppression of a jet as observed in the BHBs

               in to the problem of why and how systems -- such as the Galactic
               center -- are underluminous and variable. In particular, the
               simulations indicate that low angular-momentum accretion flow is
               highly variable both quantitatively and qualitatively. This
               variability and a relatively low mass-accretion rate are caused
               by interplay between a rotationally supported torus, its
               outflow, and a nearly non-rotating inflow.Aims. To investigate
               the applicability of such flows to real objects, we examine the
               dynamical MHD studies with computations of the time-dependent
               radiation spectra predicted by the simulations.Methods. We
               calculated the synthetic broadband spectra of accretion flows
               using Monte Carlo techniques. Our method computes the plasma
               electron temperature allowing for pressure work, ion-electron
               coupling, radiative cooling, and advection. The radiation
               spectra are calculated by taking thermal synchrotron and
               bremsstrahlung radiation, self absorption, and Comptonization
               processes into account. We also explored the effects of
               non-thermal electrons. We applied this method to calculating
               spectra predicted by the time-dependent model of an axisymmetic
               MHD flow accreting onto a black hole presented by Proga and
               Begelman.Results.Our calculations show that variability in an
               accretion flow is not always reflected in the corresponding
               spectra, at least not in all wavelengths. We find no one-to-one
               correspondence between the accretion state and the predicted
               spectrum. For example, we find that two states with different
               properties -- such as the geometry and accretion rate -- could
               have relatively similar spectra. However, we also find two very
               different states with very different spectra. The existence of
               nonthermal radiation may be needed to explain X-ray flaring
               because thermal bremsstrahlung, dominates X-ray emission, is
               produced at relatively large radii where the flow changes are

               by AGN unification, which is heated up by radiation from the
               central accreting black hole (BH). The strong 9.7 and 18 $\mu$m
               silicate features observed in the AGN spectra, in both emission
               and absorption, further indicate the presence of such dusty
               environments. We present detailed calculations of the chemistry
               of silicate dust formation in AGN accretion disk winds. The
               winds considered herein are magnetohydrodynamic winds driven off
               the entire accretion disk domain that extends from the BH
               vicinity to the radius of BH influence, of order ∼1--100 pc
               depending on the mass of the resident BH. Our results indicate
               that these winds provide conditions conducive to the formation
               of significant amounts of dust, especially for objects accreting
               close to their Eddington limit, making AGNs a significant source
               of dust in the universe, especially for luminous quasars. Our
               models justify the importance of an r−1 density law in the winds
               for efficient formation and survival of dust grains. The dust
               production rate scales linearly with the mass of the central BH
               and varies as a power law of index between 2 and 2.5 with the
               dimensionless mass accretion rate. The resultant distribution of
               the dense dusty gas resembles a toroidal shape, with high column

               of a dusty accretion torus around the central black hole
               dominates their appearance. In `type-1' systems, the bright
               nucleus is visible at the centre of a face-on torus. In `type-2'
               systems the thick, nearly edge-on torus hides the central
               engine. Later studies suggested evolutionary effects2 and added
               dusty clumps and polar winds3 but left the basic picture intact.
               However, recent high-resolution images4 of the archetypal type-2
               galaxy NGC 10685,6, suggested a more radical revision. The
               images displayed a ring-like emission feature that was proposed
               to be hot dust surrounding the black hole at the radius where
               the radiation from the central engine evaporates the dust. That
               ring is too thin and too far tilted from edge-on to hide the
               central engine, and ad hoc foreground extinction is needed to
               explain the type-2 classification. These images quickly
               generated reinterpretations of the dichotomy between types 1 and
               27,8. Here we present new multi-band mid-infrared images of NGC
               1068 that detail the dust temperature distribution and reaffirm
               the original model. Combined with radio data (J.F.G. and

               central engine that is below the previously reported ring and
               obscured by a thick, nearly edge-on disk, as predicted by the
               unified model. We also identify emission from polar flows and
               absorbing dust that is mineralogically distinct from that
               towards the Milky Way centre. Mid-infrared observations of the
               dusty structures of the galaxy NGC 1068 support the unified

               IR reverberation behavior, and its emission may originate deep
               in the circumnuclear torus. We find a reverberation signal at
               ∼10 $\mu$m with an inferred radius for the warm dust of
               ∼2.2--3.1 pc. The lack of variability at 20--40 $\mu$m indicates
               that the far-IR emission comes from even more extended regions.
               The torus properties revealed by dust reverberation analysis are
               inconsistent with predictions from pure clumpy torus models.
               Instead, the longer-wavelength emission possibly originates in a
               flared torus or the polar wind.",

                   Studying the physical properties of the outflowing gas from
                   AGN is thus crucial for understanding the co-evolution of
                   galaxies and supermassive black holes. Here we report 55 pc

                   by 55 pc resolution CO($J=1\text\{-\}0$) observations. We
                   find that [CI] emission within the central kpc is strongly
                   enhanced by a factor of $>$5 compared to the typical [CI]/CO
                   intensity ratio of $\sim$0.2 for nearby starburst galaxies
                   (in units of brightness temperature). The most [CI]-enhanced
                   gas (ratio $>$ 1) exhibits a kpc-scale elongated structure
                   centered at the AGN that matches the known biconical ionized
                   gas outflow entraining molecular gas in the disk. A
                   truncated, decelerating bicone model explains well the
                   kinematics of the elongated structure, indicating that the
                   [CI] enhancement is predominantly driven by the interaction
                   between the ISM in the disk and the highly inclined ionized
                   gas outflow (which is likely driven by the radio jet). Our

                   rather than the ``in-situ C formation'' one which prefers a
                   perfect bicone geometry. We suggest that the high [CI]/CO
                   intensity ratio gas in NGC 1068 directly traces ISM in the
                   disk that is currently dissociated and entrained by the jet

                   seeds at high redshift, we carried out axisymmetric two
                   dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations by a nested
                   simulation-box method. Here we divide the simulation box
                   into the inner zone at $(2 - 3 \times 10^3)
                   r_\{\rm\{Sch\}\}$ (with $r_\{\rm Sch\}$ being the
                   Schwarzschild radius) and the outer zone at $(2\times

                   connection of the physical quantities, such as gas density,
                   velocity, and radiation energy. We start the calculation by
                   injecting mass through the outer boundary of the inner zone
                   at a constant rate of
                   $\dot\{M\}_\{\rm\{inj\}\}=10^3L_\{\rm\{Edd\}\}/c^2$, where
                   $L_\{\rm\{Edd\}\}$ is the Eddington luminosity and $c$ is
                   the speed of light. A powerful outflow is generated in the
                   innermost region and it propagates from the inner zone to
                   the outer zone. The outflows are characterized by a velocity
                   of 0.02$c$ (0.7$c$) and density of $10^\{-17\}$
                   ($10^\{-19\}$) g cm$^\{-3\}$ for near the edge-on (face-on)
                   direction. The outflow is gradually accelerated as it
                   travels by accepting radiation-pressure force. The final
                   mass outflow rate at the outermost boundary is
                   $\dot\{M\}_\{\rm\{out\}\}\sim 0.3 \times
                   \dot\{M\}_\{\rm\{inj\}\}$. By extrapolating the outflow
                   structure to a further larger scale, we find that the

                   L_\{\rm\{Edd\}\}$, respectively. Moreover, we find that the
                   impacts are highly anisotropic in the sense that larger
                   impacts are given towards the face-on direction than in the
                   edge-on direction. These results indicate that the BH

                   some constraints on its origin. We study the properties of

                   inferred from the H$\beta$ line, is universal in all

                   to the limiting value that permits for the existence of the

               studies. The reason is that the region is unresolved, and the
               reverberation mapping results imply a complex velocity field. We
               adopt a theory-motivated approach to identify the principal
               mechanism responsible for this complex phenomenon. We consider
               the possibility that the role of dust is essential. We assume
               that the local radiation pressure acting on the dust in the
               accretion disk atmosphere launches the outflow of material, but
               higher above the disk the irradiation from the central parts
               causes dust evaporation and a subsequent fallback. This failed
               radiatively accelerated dusty outflow is expected to represent
               the material forming low ionization lines. In this paper we
               formulate simple analytical equations to describe the cloud
               motion, including the evaporation phase. The model is fully
               described just by the basic parameters of black hole mass,
               accretion rate, black hole spin, and viewing angle. We study how
               the spectral line generic profiles correspond to this dynamic.
               We show that the virial factor calculated from our model
               strongly depends on the black hole mass in the case of enhanced
               dust opacity, and thus it then correlates with the line width.
               This could explain why the virial factor measured in galaxies
               with pseudobulges differs from that obtained from objects with
               classical bulges, although the trend predicted by the current
               version of the model is opposite to the observed trend.",

              observational hallmark of quasars1. Observations of broad
              emission lines could potentially constrain the mechanism for
              transporting gas inwards through accretion disks or outwards
              through winds2. The size of regions for which broad emission
              lines are observed (broad-line regions) has been estimated by
              measuring the delay in light travel time between the variable
              brightness of the accretion disk continuum and the emission
              lines3-a method known as reverberation mapping. In some models
              the emission lines arise from a continuous outflow4, whereas in
              others they arise from orbiting gas clouds5. Directly imaging
              such regions has not hitherto been possible because of their
              small angular size (less than 10-4 arcseconds3,6). Here we report
              a spatial offset (with a spatial resolution of 10-5 arcseconds,
              or about 0.03 parsecs for a distance of 550 million parsecs)

               very small dispersion. Such a scaling favored the dust-based
               formation mechanism of the broad-line region (BLR). Recent
               reverberation measurements showed that actually a significant

               be explained by the old concept of scaling of the BLR size with
               the ionization parameter. Assuming a universal value of this
               parameter and a universal value of the cloud density reproduces
               the distribution of observational points in the time

               ejection around super massive black holes (SMBHs) is important
               to understand the evolution of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and
               therefore of the large scale structures of the Universe.Aims. We
               aim at providing a simple, coherent, and global view of the
               sub-parsec accretion and ejection flow in AGN with varying
               Eddington ratio, ṁ, and black hole mass, MBH.Methods. We made
               use of theoretical insights, results of numerical simulations,
               as well as UV and X-ray observations to review the inner regions
               of AGN by including different accretion and ejection modes, with
               special emphasis on the role of radiation in driving powerful
               accretion disk winds from the inner regions around the central
               SMBH.Results. We propose five ṁ regimes where the physics of the
               inner accretion and ejection flow around SMBHs is expected to
               change, and that correspond observationally to quiescent and
               inactive galaxies; low luminosity AGN (LLAGN); Seyferts and
               mini-broad absorption line quasars (mini-BAL QSOs); narrow line
               Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s) and broad absorption line quasars

               high ṁ, large MBH regime, and possibly present but likely weak
               in the moderate ṁ, small MBH regime.Conclusions. A great
               diversity of the accretion/ejection flows in AGN can be
               explained to a good degree by varying just two fundamental
               properties: the Eddington ratio ṁ and the black hole mass MBH,
               and by the inclusion of accretion disk winds that can naturally

               broad-line region (BLR) holiday, in which the emission lines
               decorrelated from the continuum variations. This is important
               since the correlation between the continuum-flux variations and
               the emission-line response is the basic assumption for black
               hole (BH) mass determinations through reverberation mapping.
               During the BLR holiday the high-ionization intrinsic absorption
               lines also decorrelated from the continuum as a result of the
               variable covering factor of the line-of-sight (LOS) obscurer.
               The emission lines are not confined to the LOS, so this does not
               explain the BLR holiday. If the LOS obscurer is a disk wind, its
               streamlines must extend down to the plane of the disk and the
               base of the wind would lie between the BH and the BLR, forming
               an equatorial obscurer. This obscurer can be transparent to
               ionizing radiation, or can be translucent, blocking only parts
               of the spectral energy distribution, depending on its density.
               An emission-line holiday is produced if the wind density
               increases only slightly above its transparent state. Both
               obscurers are parts of the same wind, so they can have
               associated behavior in a way that explains both holidays. A very
               dense wind would block nearly all ionizing radiation, producing
               a Seyfert 2 and possibly providing a contributor to the
               changing-look active galactic nucleus phenomenon. Disk winds are
               very common and we propose that the equatorial obscurers are
               too, but mostly in a transparent state.",

                   revealed this archetypal Seyfert-1 galaxy to be in an
                   exceptional state of persistent heavy absorption. Our
                   observations taken in 2013-2014 with XMM-Newton, Swift,
                   NuSTAR, INTEGRAL, Chandra, HST and two ground-based
                   observatories have together enabled us to establish that
                   this unexpected phenomenon is caused by an outflowing stream
                   of weakly ionised gas (called the obscurer), extending from
                   the vicinity of the accretion disk to the broad-line region.
                   In this work we present the details of our campaign and the
                   data obtained by all the observatories. We determine the
                   spectral energy distribution of NGC 5548 from near-infrared
                   to hard X-rays by establishing the contribution of various
                   emission and absorption processes taking place along our
                   line of sight towards the central engine. We thus uncover
                   the intrinsic emission and produce a broadband continuum
                   model for both obscured (average summer 2013 data) and
                   unobscured ($<$ 2011) epochs of NGC 5548. Our results
                   suggest that the intrinsic NIR/optical/UV continuum is a
                   single Comptonised component with its higher energy tail
                   creating the 'soft X-ray excess'. This component is
                   compatible with emission from a warm, optically-thick corona
                   as part of the inner accretion disk. We then investigate the
                   effects of the continuum on the ionisation balance and
                   thermal stability of photoionised gas for unobscured and

                   it possible to image these structures for the first time. We

                   central unresolved flux of ~0.5 Jy, a thin disk 1.9 pc in
                   diameter oriented along ~45 deg,and a ~4x1.5 pc polar
                   emission extending orthogonal to the disk. The polar
                   emission exhibits patchiness, which we attribute to clumpy
                   dust. Flux enhancements to the east and west of the disk are
                   seen for the first time. We distinguish the temperature
                   profiles of the disk and of the polar emission: the disk
                   shows a steep temperature gradient indicative of denser
                   material; the polar profile is flatter, indicating
                   clumpiness and/or lower dust density. The unresolved flux is
                   fitted with a high temperature, ~370 K. The polar dust
                   remains warm (~200 K) out to 1.5 pc from the disk. The

                   results we have carried out a detailed analysis of the
                   turbulent dynamics in Fourier space, focusing on the effect
                   increasing Pm has on the transverse cascade -- a key
                   non-linear process induced by the disc shear flow that is
                   responsible for the sustenance of MRI turbulence. Finally,
                   we find that the scaling of turbulent transport with Pm is
                   sensitive to the box vertical-to-radial aspect ratio, as
                   well as to the background shear: tall boxes exhibit weaker
                   scaling compared to cubic boxes, while MRI turbulence in
                   sub-Keplerian shear flows (characteristic of protoneutron
                   stars) exhibits stronger scaling than it does in Keplerian

              depends strongly on the black hole spin and on the magnetic flux
              at the horizon. Unless these are very small, the energy output in
              the jet dominates over that in the wind. For a rapidly spinning
              black hole accreting in the magnetically arrested limit, it is
              confirmed that jet power exceeds the total rate of accretion of
              rest mass energy. However, because of strong collimation, the jet
              probably does not have a significant feedback effect on its
              immediate surroundings. The power in the wind is more modest and
              shows a weaker dependence on black hole spin and magnetic flux.

              mass-feeding mechanisms that lead to this growth in active
              galactic nuclei (AGNs), focusing on constraints derived from
              observations of their environment, from extragalactic down to
              galactic and nuclear scales. At high AGN luminosities, galaxy
              mergers and interactions play an important role in AGN triggering
              and feeding. However, chaotic cold gas accretion in galaxy
              clusters can trigger radiatively inefficient AGNs in brightest
              cluster galaxies. At lower luminosities, minor mergers feed AGNs
              in early-type, gas-starving galaxies, while secular processes
              dominate in later-type, gas-rich galaxies. While bars do not
              appear to directly feed AGNs, AGN flickering leads to the
              dissociation of small and large scales, hence affecting the
              interpretation of cause and effect. At ~100 pc scales, recent
              observations have revealed compact disks and inflows along
              nuclear gaseous spirals and bars, while chaotic cold accretion
              continues to feed the brightest cluster galaxies at these scales.
              Estimated mass inflow rates---of 0.01 to a few M⊙ yr-1---are in
              many cases 1,000 times higher than the mass accretion rate to the

              X-ray biconical structures, of kiloparsec scale, are widespread
              in highly absorbed Compton Thick (CT) AGNs. The X-ray emission is
              complex, requiring both photoionized and shock-ionized gas. It
              originates from high ionization regions and is surrounded by
              cocoons of low ionization narrow line emission regions (LINERS).
              Bicone 3-6 keV continuum and 6.4 keV Fe Kalpha emission has been
              detected, contrary to the standard AGN model expectation that
              would confine this hard emission to the pc-size nuclear absorbing

              relativistic jets with the host ISM a few kpc from the central
              AGN; and photoionization of the ISM via winds on scales from pc
              to multiple kpc. These results demonstrate that X-rays are needed
              to develop a complete picture of AGN/host interaction along with
              radio continuum, mm and sub-mm molecular line emission, and

              that the peak of the integrated line emission in the active
              galactic nuclei (AGN) is significantly offset from the systemic
              velocity as traced by the stellar absorption features, indicating
              that the profiles are dominated by outflow. In contrast, matched
              inactive galaxies are characterized by a systemic peak and weaker
              outflow wing. We present three independent estimates of the
              electron density in these AGN, discussing the merits of the
              different methods. The electron density derived from the [S II]
              doublet is significantly lower than that found with a method
              developed in the last decade using auroral and transauroral

                   focus on a small dynamical range. Therefore, it is unknown
                   how far the winds can go and what the properties of the
                   winds will be if they can move to large radii. We perform
                   simulations to study the large scale dynamics of winds
                   driven by line force. We find that the properties of the
                   winds depend on both black hole mass ($M_\{BH\}$) and
                   accretion disk luminosity. When the accretion disk
                   luminosity is $0.6L_\{edd\}$ ($L_\{edd\}$ being Eddington
                   luminosity), independent of $M_\{BH\}$, the winds have
                   kinetic energy flux exceeding $1\% L_\{edd\}$ and can escape
                   from the black hole potential. For the case with the
                   accretion disk luminosity equaling 0.3$L_\{edd\}$, the
                   strength of the winds decreases with the decrease of
                   $M_\{BH\}$. If $M_\{BH\}$ decreases from $10^9$ to $10^6$
                   solar mass ($M_\odot$), the winds kinetic energy flux
                   decreases from $\sim 0.01 L_\{edd\}$ to $ \sim 10^\{-6\}
                   L_\{edd\}$. In case of $M_\{BH\}\geq 10^7 M_\odot$, winds
                   can escape from black hole potential. In the case of
                   $M_\{BH\}=10^6 M_\odot$, the winds can not escape. We find
                   that for the ultra-fast winds observed in hard X-ray bands
                   (\textbackslashcitealt\{Gofford et al. 2015\}), the observed
                   dependence of the mass flux and the kinetic energy flux on
                   accretion disk luminosity can be well produced by line force
                   driven winds model. We also find that the properties of the

              presence of a strong magnetic field (B-field) that enhances, or
              is the cause of, the accretion activity and the jet power. Here,

              $89$ $\mu$m polarization with HAWC+/SOFIA. We find that the
              thermal polarized emission increases with the nuclear
              radio-loudness, $R=L_\{\rm 5GHz\}/ L_\{\rm B\}$ and $R_\{20\} =
              L_\{\rm 5GHz\}/ L_\{\rm 20\mu m\}$. The dust emission cores of RL
              AGN are measured to be polarized, $\sim5-11$\%, while RQ AGN are
              unpolarized, $<1\%$. For RQ AGN, our results are consistent with

              turbulent, disk and/or expanding outflow at scales of $5-80$ pc
              from the AGN. For RL AGN, the measured $89$ $\mu$m polarization
              arises primarily from magnetically aligned dust grains associated
              with a $5-80$ pc-scale dusty structure with a toroidal B-field

              of the B-fields surrounding the AGN are intrinsically related to
              the strength of the jet power -- the stronger the jet power is,
              the larger and stronger the toroidal B-field is. The detection of
              a $\le80$ pc-scale ordered toroidal B-field suggests that a) the
              infalling gas that fuels RL AGN is magnetized, b) there is a
              magnetohydrodynamic wind that collimates the jet, and/or c) the

                   other Type 1 AGN, such as Seyfert 1 galaxies, suggesting
                   that the inner part of the broad-line region (BLR) is also

              to impose constraints on accretion disk parameters. The observed

              inclinations smaller than 50°, surface emissivity slopes of
              1.0-2.5, outer radii larger than ~2000RG, inner radii of
              (200-800)RG, and local turbulent broadening of 780-1800 km s-1.
              The comparison suggests that 60\% of accretion disks require some
              form of asymmetry (e.g., elliptical disks, warps, spiral shocks,
              or hot spots).",

              clouds. The derived physical size of the X-ray sources (~(3-28)

              column densities of ~1022-1023 cm-2, thus a single cloud may
              block the X-ray source, leading to notorious temporal variability

                   single-peaked or double-peaked profiles; and originate from
                   a complex dynamics of the likely discrete clouds moving in a
                   spatially extended region so-called Broad Line Region (BLR).
                   We follow a non-hydrodynamical single-cloud approach to the
                   BLR dynamics based on the dust-driving model of Czerny \&
                   Hryniewicz. We previously showed in details that the 2.5D
                   version of the model could provide us with the 3D geometry
                   of the BLR. In this paper, we provide a large grid of
                   results based on which we aim at testing the model with
                   calculation of the spectral line generic profiles. We show
                   that the shape of profiles not only depends on the accretion
                   rate of the source, the black hole mass, and the viewing

                   continuum) convolved with a response function that depends
                   on the geometry. However, it has long been known that BLR
                   variability can deviate from these predictions. We analyze
                   both extensive long-term H$\beta$ and continuum monitoring
                   of NGC 5548 and a large sample of high-quality H$\beta$
                   light curves of other AGNs to investigate the frequency and
                   characteristics of anomalous responses of the BLR. We find
                   that anomalies are very common and probably occur in every
                   object. Onsets can be on a timescale only slightly longer
                   than the light-crossing time and durations are of the order
                   of the characteristic timescale of variability of the
                   optical continuum to several times longer. Anomalies are
                   larger when NGC 5548 is in a low state, but otherwise there
                   is no correlation with continuum variability. There is
                   abundant evidence for the optical continuum of AGNs varying
                   independently of the higher-energy continua and this is
                   sufficient to explain the anomalous responses of the total
                   BLR flux. There are good reasons for believing that the
                   frequent lack of correlation between spectral regions is due
                   to anisotropic and non-axisymmetric emission. Rapid changes
                   in line profiles and velocity-dependent lags are consistent
                   with this. Motion of compact absorbing clouds across the
                   line of sight is another possible cause of anomalies. The
                   prevalence of anomalies should be considered when planning

                   feeds the nuclear Super-Massive Black Hole. Yet, even its
                   most basic structural properties (such as its extent,
                   geometry and elongation) are unknown for all but a few
                   archetypal objects. Since most AGNs are unresolved in the
                   mid-infrared, we utilize the MID-infrared interferometric
                   Instrument (MIDI) at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer
                   (VLTI) that is sensitive to structures as small as a few
                   milli-arcseconds (mas). We present here an extensive amount
                   of new interferometric observations from the MIDI AGN Large
                   Program (2009 - 2011) and add data from the archive to give
                   a complete view of the existing MIDI observations of AGNs.
                   Additionally, we have obtained high-quality mid-infrared
                   spectra from VLT/VISIR. We present correlated and total flux
                   spectra for 23 AGNs and derive flux and size estimates at 12
                   micron using simple axisymmetric geometrical models. Perhaps
                   the most surprising result is the relatively high level of
                   unresolved flux and its large scatter: The median ``point
                   source fraction'' is 70 \% for type 1 and 47 \% for type 2
                   AGNs meaning that a large part of the flux is concentrated
                   on scales smaller than about 5 mas (0.1 - 10 pc). Among
                   sources observed with similar spatial resolution, it varies
                   from 20 \% - 100 \%. For 18 of the sources, two nuclear
                   components can be distinguished in the radial fits. While
                   these models provide good fits to all but the brightest
                   sources, significant elongations are detected in eight
                   sources. The half-light radii of the fainter sources are

  abstract = "We present the results of a comprehensive study of the broad
              H$\alpha$ emission lines of radio galaxies and radio-loud
              quasars. The data consist of 74 new spectra plus information
              drawn from 20 spectra in the literature. The principal result is
              the discovery of eight new double- peaked H$\alpha$ profiles that
              can be fitted by a simple relativistic disk model, bringing the
              total number of such profiles to 12. Disklike emitters comprise
              10\% of radio-loud objects in our representative sample and
              arguably constitute a new ``class'' on the basis of the following
              additional properties which they possess: (1) average H$\alpha$
              full width at half-maximum twice as large as the remainder of the
              sample (12,500 km s^-1^ vs. 5700 km s^-1^), (2) optical continuum
              around H$\alpha$ consisting of 20\%- 100\% starlight, versus less
              than 20\% for the other objects, (3) large equivalent widths of
              low-ionization forbidden lines [O I] and [S II]), and (4) large
              [O I]/[O III] ratios. The properties of the disklike emitters are
              argued to be intrinsic, since they are not extensions of any of
              the known correlations which are thought to represent viewing
              angle effects in several unifying schemes for radio- loud
              objects. Neither are there any radio-quiet counterparts of this
              class. The Chen \& Halpern model, in which the inner disk is an
              ion- supported torus which illuminates the outer disk with a hard
              ionizing continuum, goes a long way toward explaining the
              properties of disklike emitters, and why they are best recognized
              in H$\alpha$. The applicability of other models, such as
              supermassive binary black holes, jets, and other radial flows,
              are also evaluated for disklike profiles and other objects in our
              sample. For the entire sample of radio-loud objects, the broad
              H$\alpha$ lines at half-maximum are preferentially redshifted
              with respect to the narrow lines by = (6 +/- 2) x 10^-4^ on
              average, which corresponds to Keplerian motion at a radius of
              ~2500 GM/c^2^ if interpreted as gravitational plus transverse
              redshift. This result is entirely consistent with previous
              studies of H$\beta$, which find more redshifts in radio-loud
              samples, but equal numbers of blueshifts and redshifts in
              optically selected samples. Thus, in radio-loud objects, the
              Balmer-line emitting gas is more likely to be dominated by
              gravitational motion close to the black hole than in radio-quiet
              objects. Although we neither support nor contradict unifying
              models based on viewing direction, it appears that the disklike
              profiles are better fitted by small inclination angles. Although
              contrary to the conventional interpretation of the broadest
              emission lines in radio-loud AGNs, this is to be expected for an
              accretion disk origin. A number of reasons are suggested for this
              possible selection effect, with the consequence that the
              accretion disk could contribute at least partially to the Balmer
              lines of significantly more objects than just the 10\% which are
              obvious. We obtained new (secure) redshifts for five objects
              which had incorrect values in the literature.",

                   the role BLRs play in the AGN phenomenon. The high
                   equivalent widths of the lines imply a high BLR covering
                   factor, and the absence of clear evidence for absorption by
                   the BLR means that the BLR has a flattened distribution and
                   that we always view it near pole-on. The BLR gas is strongly
                   self-shielding near the equatorial plane. Velocity-resolved
                   reverberation mapping has long strongly excluded significant
                   outflow of the BLR and shows instead that the predominant
                   motions are Keplerian with large turbulence and a
                   significant net inflow. The rotation and turbulence are
                   consistent with the inferred geometry. The blueshifting of
                   high-ionization lines is a consequence of scattering off
                   inflowing material rather than the result of an outflowing
                   wind. The rate of inflow of the BLR is sufficient to provide
                   the accretion rate needed to power the AGN. Because the
                   motions of the BLR are gravitationally dominated, and the
                   BLR structure is very similar in most AGNs, consistent black
                   hole masses can be determined. The good correlation between
                   these estimates and masses predicted from the bulge
                   luminosities of host galaxies provides strong support for
                   the similarity of AGN continuum shapes and the correctness
                   of the BLR picture presented. It is concluded that although
                   many mysteries remain about the details of how AGNs work, a
                   general overall picture of the torus and BLR is becoming

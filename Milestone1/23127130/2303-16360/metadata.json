    "abstract": "Through two-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamical simulations, we investigate the spectral properties of ionized gas irradiated by an active galactic nucleus with a supermassive black hole of 10^7 Msun. For the gas inside the dust-sublimation radius (r ~ 10^{-2} pc), we conduct post-process pseudo-three-dimensional calculations utilizing the spectral synthesis code Cloudy. We show that we can reproduce various broad emission lines in optical and ultraviolet wavelengths. The line profiles change depending on the viewing angles even for a small range from the rational axis, i.e., 5-30 degrees; most lines, such as Halpha, are characterized by a double-peaked profile, reflecting that the emissions are originated in the surface of the rotating disk. By contrast, high-ionization emission lines such as CIV 1549 show a double-peaked profile for a nearly face-on view, as these lines derive from the fast outflowing gas from the disk surface. Our results suggest that some properties of the bright UV-optical emission lines observed in Seyfert-like AGNs can be caused by the radiation-driven fountain flow inside the dust sublimation radius.",

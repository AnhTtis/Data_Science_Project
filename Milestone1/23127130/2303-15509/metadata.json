    "abstract": "We use a formalism that describes electron ejections from graphene-like targets by dark matter (DM) scattering for general forms of scalar and spin 1/2 DM-electron interactions in combination with state-of-the-art density functional calculations to produce predictions and reach estimates for various possible carbon-based detector designs. Our results indicate the importance of a proper description of the target electronic structure. In addition, we find a strong dependence of the predicted observed signal for different DM candidate masses and interaction types on the detailed geometry and design of the detector. Combined with directional background vetoing, these dependencies will enable the identification of DM particle properties once a signal has been established.",

title = {Automatic Morphological Classification of Galaxies: Convolutional Autoencoder and Bagging-based Multiclustering Model},
journal = {The Astronomical Journal},
abstract = {In order to obtain morphological information of unlabeled galaxies, we present an unsupervised machine-learning (UML) method for morphological classification of galaxies, which can be summarized as two aspects: (1) the methodology of convolutional autoencoder (CAE) is used to reduce the dimensions and extract features from the imaging data; (2) the bagging-based multiclustering model is proposed to obtain the classifications with high confidence at the cost of rejecting the disputed sources that are inconsistently voted. We apply this method on the sample of galaxies with H &lt; 24.5 in CANDELS. Galaxies are clustered into 100 groups, each contains galaxies with analogous characteristics. To explore the robustness of the morphological classifications, we merge 100 groups into five categories by visual verification, including spheroid, early-type disk, late-type disk, irregular, and unclassifiable. After eliminating the unclassifiable category and the sources with inconsistent voting, the purity of the remaining four subclasses are significantly improved. Massive galaxies (M * &gt; 1010 M ⊙) are selected to investigate the connection with other physical properties. The classification scheme separates galaxies well in the U − V and V − J color space and Gini–M 20 space. The gradual tendency of Sérsic indexes and effective radii is shown from the spheroid subclass to the irregular subclass. It suggests that the combination of CAE and multiclustering strategy is an effective method to cluster galaxies with similar features and can yield high-quality morphological classifications. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of UML in morphological analysis that would develop and serve the future observations made with China Space Station telescope.}

	abstract = {The DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (http://legacysurvey.org/) are a combination of three public projects (the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey, the Beijing–Arizona Sky Survey, and the Mayall z-band Legacy Survey) that will jointly image ≈14,000 deg2 of the extragalactic sky visible from the northern hemisphere in three optical bands (g, r, and z) using telescopes at the Kitt Peak National Observatory and the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory. The combined survey footprint is split into two contiguous areas by the Galactic plane. The optical imaging is conducted using a unique strategy of dynamically adjusting the exposure times and pointing selection during observing that results in a survey of nearly uniform depth. In addition to calibrated images, the project is delivering a catalog, constructed by using a probabilistic inference-based approach to estimate source shapes and brightnesses. The catalog includes photometry from the grz optical bands and from four mid-infrared bands (at 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 μm) observed by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer satellite during its full operational lifetime. The project plans two public data releases each year. All the software used to generate the catalogs is also released with the data. This paper provides an overview of the Legacy Surveys project.}

    abstract = "{Blending of galaxies has a major contribution in the systematic error budget of weak-lensing studies, affecting photometric and shape measurements, particularly for ground-based, deep, photometric galaxy surveys, such as the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Existing deblenders mostly rely on analytic modelling of galaxy profiles and suffer from the lack of flexible yet accurate models. We propose to use generative models based on deep neural networks, namely variational autoencoders (VAE), to learn probabilistic models directly from data. We train a VAE on images of centred, isolated galaxies, which we reuse, as a prior, in a second VAE-like neural network in charge of deblending galaxies. We train our networks on simulated images including six LSST bandpass filters and the visible and near-infrared bands of the Euclid satellite, as our method naturally generalizes to multiple bands and can incorporate data from multiple instruments. We obtain median reconstruction errors on ellipticities and r-band magnitude between ±0.01 and ±0.05, respectively, in most cases, and ellipticity multiplicative bias of 1.6 per cent for blended objects in the optimal configuration. We also study the impact of decentring and prove the method to be robust. This method only requires the approximate centre of each target galaxy, but no assumptions about the number of surrounding objects, pointing to an iterative detection/deblending procedure we leave for future work. Finally, we discuss future challenges about training on real data and obtain encouraging results when applying transfer learning.}",

Deeper DECaLS images (r = 23.6 versus r = 22.2 from SDSS) reveal spiral arms, weak bars, and tidal features not previously visible in SDSS imaging. To best exploit the greater depth of DECaLS images, volunteers select from a new set of answers designed to improve our sensitivity to mergers and bars. Galaxy Zoo volunteers provide 7.5 million individual classifications over 314 000 galaxies. 140 000 galaxies receive at least 30 classifications, sufficient to accurately measure detailed morphology like bars, and the remainder receive approximately 5. All classifications are used to train an ensemble of Bayesian convolutional neural networks (a state-of-the-art deep learning method) to predict posteriors for the detailed morphology of all 314 000 galaxies. We use active learning to focus our volunteer effort on the galaxies which, if labelled, would be most informative for training our ensemble.

Morphology is a powerful probe for quantifying a galaxy's dynamical history; however, automatic classifications of morphology (either by computer analysis of images or by using other physical parameters as proxies) still have drawbacks when compared to visual inspection. The large number of images available in current surveys makes visual inspection of each galaxy impractical for individual astronomers. GZ2 uses classifications from volunteer citizen scientists to measure morphologies for all galaxies in the DR7 Legacy survey with mr \\&gt; 17, in addition to deeper images from SDSS Stripe 82. While the original GZ2 project identified galaxies as early-types, late-types or mergers, GZ2 measures finer morphological features. These include bars, bulges and the shapes of edge-on disks, as well as quantifying the relative strengths of galactic bulges and spiral arms. This paper presents the full public data release for the project, including measures of accuracy and bias. The majority (≳90 per cent) of GZ2 classifications agree with those made by professional astronomers, especially for morphological T-types, strong bars and arm curvature.

    abstract = "{Galaxy morphology is a fundamental quantity, which is essential not only for the full spectrum of galaxy-evolution studies, but also for a plethora of science in observational cosmology (e.g. as a prior for photometric-redshift measurements and as contextual data for transient light-curve classifications). While a rich literature exists on morphological-classification techniques, the unprecedented data volumes, coupled, in some cases, with the short cadences of forthcoming ‘Big-Data’ surveys (e.g. from the LSST), present novel challenges for this field. Large data volumes make such data sets intractable for visual inspection (even via massively distributed platforms like Galaxy Zoo), while short cadences make it difficult to employ techniques like supervised machine learning, since it may be impractical to repeatedly produce training sets on short time-scales. Unsupervised machine learning, which does not require training sets, is ideally suited to the morphological analysis of new and forthcoming surveys. Here, we employ an algorithm that performs clustering of graph representations, in order to group image patches with similar visual properties and objects constructed from those patches, like galaxies. We implement the algorithm on the Hyper-Suprime-Cam Subaru-Strategic-Program Ultra-Deep survey, to autonomously reduce the galaxy population to a small number (160) of ‘morphological clusters’, populated by galaxies with similar morphologies, which are then benchmarked using visual inspection. The morphological classifications (which we release publicly) exhibit a high level of purity, and reproduce known trends in key galaxy properties as a function of morphological type at z \\&lt; 1 (e.g. stellar-mass functions, rest-frame colours, and the position of galaxies on the star-formation main sequence). Our study demonstrates the power of unsupervised machine learning in performing accurate morphological analysis, which will become indispensable in this new era of deep-wide surveys.}",

We provide a comprehensive characterization of the activity of present-day S0s throughout both the broad-band PC1–PC2 spectral classifier and the conventional narrow-line BPT/WHAN ones, contrasting the different types of activity classes they define, and present an alternative diagram that exploits the concordance between WHAN and PCA demarcations. The analysis is extended to the mid-infrared, radio and X-ray wavelengths by crossmatching our core sample with data from the WISE, FIRST, XMM–Newton, and Chandra surveys. This has allowed us to carry out a thorough comparison of the most important activity diagnostics in the literature over different wavebands, discuss their similarities and differences, and explore the connections between them and with parameters related to star formation and black hole accretion. In particular, we find evidence that the bulk of nebular emission from radio and X-ray detected S0–Seyfert and LINER systems is not driven by star birth, while the dominant ionising radiation for a number of LINERs might come from post-AGB stars. These and other outcomes from the present work should be transferable to other morphologies.}",

The main methods we explore are: (i) principal component analysis (PCA), which provides information on how independent and informative the input parameters are; (ii) encoder neural networks, which allow us to find both linear (PCA-like) and non-linear combinations of the input, illustrating an example of an unsupervised ANN; and (iii) supervised ANNs (using the back-propagation or quasi-Newton algorithm) based on a training set for which the human classification is known. Here the output for previously unclassified galaxies can be interpreted as either a continuous (analogue) output (for example T-type) or a Bayesian a posteriori probability for each class. Although the ESO-LV parameters are suboptimal, the success of the ANN in reproducing the human classification is 2 T-type units, similar to the degree of agreement between two human experts who classify the same galaxy images on plate material. We also examine the aspects of ANN configurations, reproducibility, scaling of input parameters and redshift information.}",

	abstract = {We study the optical colors of 147,920 galaxies brighter than g* = 21, observed in five bands by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) over ∼100 deg2 of high Galactic latitude sky along the celestial equator. The distribution of galaxies in the g*-r* versus u*-g* color-color diagram is strongly bimodal, with an optimal color separator of u*-r* = 2.22. We use visual morphology and spectral classification of subsamples of 287 and 500 galaxies, respectively, to show that the two peaks correspond roughly to early- (E, S0, and Sa) and late-type (Sb, Sc, and Irr) galaxies, as expected from their different stellar populations. We also find that the colors of galaxies are correlated with their radial profiles, as measured by the concentration index and by the likelihoods of exponential and de Vaucouleurs' profile fits. While it is well known that late-type galaxies are bluer than early-type galaxies, this is the first detection of a local minimum in their color distribution. In all SDSS bands, the counts versus apparent magnitude relations for the two color types are significantly different and demonstrate that the fraction of blue galaxies increases toward the faint end.}

We extract images of merging and non-merging galaxies from the Illustris-1 cosmological simulation and apply observational and experimental noise that mimics that from the Hubble Space Telescope; the data without noise form a “pristine” data set and that with noise form a “noisy” data set. The test set classification accuracy of the CNN is 79% for pristine and 76% for noisy. The CNN outperforms a Random Forest classifier, which was shown to be superior to conventional one- or two-dimensional statistical methods (Concentration, Asymmetry, the Gini, M20 statistics etc.), which are commonly used when classifying merging galaxies. We also investigate the selection effects of the classifier with respect to merger state and star formation rate, finding no bias. Finally, we extract Grad-CAMs (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) from the results to further assess and interrogate the fidelity of the classification model.}

In this study, we have taken the case of the Fanaroff–Riley (FR) class of radio galaxies as well as radio galaxies with bent-tailed morphology. We have used archival data from the Very Large Array (VLA)—Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty Centimeters survey and existing visually classified samples available in the literature to train a neural network for morphological classification of these categories of radio sources. Our training sample size for each of these categories is ∼200 sources, which has been augmented by rotated versions of the same. Our study shows that CNNs can classify images of the FRI and FRII and bent-tailed radio galaxies with high accuracy (maximum precision at 95%) using well-defined samples and a “fusion classifier,” which combines the results of binary classifications, while allowing for a mechanism to find sources with unusual morphologies. The individual precision is highest for bent-tailed radio galaxies at 95% and is 91% and 75% for the FRI and FRII classes, respectively, whereas the recall is highest for FRI and FRIIs at 91% each, while the bent-tailed class has a recall of 79%. These results show that our results are comparable to that of manual classification, while being much faster. Finally, we discuss the computational and data-related challenges associated with the morphological classification of radio galaxies with CNNs.}

	abstract = {The multivariate tool of principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to 23 fields in the FCRAO CO Survey of the Outer Galaxy. PCA enables the identification of line profile differences, which are assumed to be generated from fluctuations within a turbulent velocity field. The variation of these velocity differences with spatial scale within a molecular region is described by a singular power law, δv = cLα, which can be used as a powerful diagnostic to turbulent motions. For the ensemble of 23 fields, we find a mean value = 0.62 ± 0.11. From a recent calibration of this method using fractal Brownian motion simulations (Brunt & Heyer), the measured velocity difference-size relationship corresponds to an energy spectrum, E(k), which varies as k-β, where β = 2.17 ± 0.31. We compare our results to both decaying and forced hydrodynamic simulations of turbulence. We conclude that energy must be continually injected into the regions to replenish that lost by dissipative processes such as shocks. The absence of large, widely distributed shocks within the targeted fields suggests that the energy is injected at spatial scales less than several parsecs.}

The human brain confronts the same problem in everyday perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputs—30,000 auditory nerve fibers or 106 optic nerve fibers—a manageably small number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS), our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure.}}

Indeed, this is the case for the search for strong gravitational lenses, where the population of the detectable lensed sources is only a very small fraction of the full source population. We apply for the first time a morphological classification method based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for recognizing strong gravitational lenses in 255 deg2 of the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS), one of the current-generation optical wide surveys. The CNN is currently optimized to recognize lenses with Einstein radii ≳1.4 arcsec, about twice the r-band seeing in KiDS. In a sample of 21 789 colour–magnitude selected luminous red galaxies (LRGs), of which three are known lenses, the CNN retrieves 761 strong-lens candidates and correctly classifies two out of three of the known lenses. The misclassified lens has an Einstein radius below the range on which the algorithm is trained. We down-select the most reliable 56 candidates by a joint visual inspection. This final sample is presented and discussed. A conservative estimate based on our results shows that with our proposed method it should be possible to find ∼100 massive LRG-galaxy lenses at z ≲ 0.4 in KiDS when completed. In the most optimistic scenario, this number can grow considerably (to maximally ∼2400 lenses), when widening the colour–magnitude selection and training the CNN to recognize smaller image-separation lens systems.}",

This set-up provides 27 clusters created with this unsupervised learning that we show are well separated based on galaxy shape and structure (e.g. Sérsic index, concentration, asymmetry, Gini coefficient). These resulting clusters also correlate well with physical properties such as the colour–magnitude diagram, and span the range of scaling relations such as mass versus size amongst the different machine-defined clusters. When we merge these multiple clusters into two large preliminary clusters to provide a binary classification, an accuracy of \\$\\sim 87\\{\\{\\ \\rm per\\ cent\\}\\}\\$ is reached using an imbalanced data set, matching real galaxy distributions, which includes 22.7 per cent early-type galaxies and 77.3 per cent late-type galaxies.

However, for a few percent of galaxies in every survey, these observations are insufficient and derived properties can be catastrophically wrong. Further, it is currently difficult or impossible to determine which objects have failed, so that these contaminate every study of galaxy properties. We develop a novel method to identify these objects by combining the astronomical codes that infer galaxy properties with the dimensionality reduction algorithm t-SNE, which groups similar objects to determine which inferred properties are out of place. This method provides an improvement for the COSMOS catalog, which already uses existing techniques for catastrophic error removal, and therefore should improve the quality of large catalogs and any studies that are sensitive to large redshift errors.}

	abstract = {Context.
              Stellar bars are a common morphological feature of spiral galaxies. While it is known that they can form in isolation, or be induced tidally, few studies have explored the production of stellar bars in galaxy merging. We look to investigate bar formation in galaxy merging using methods from deep learning to analyse our
              N
              -body simulations.
            
            
              Aims.
              The primary aim is to determine the constraints on the mass ratio and orientations of merging galaxies that are most conducive to bar formation. We further aim to explore whether it is possible to classify simulated barred spiral galaxies based on the mechanism of their formation. We test the feasibility of this new classification schema with simulated galaxies.
            
            
              Methods.
              Using a set of 29 400 images obtained from our simulations, we first trained a convolutional neural network to distinguish between barred and non-barred galaxies. We then tested the network on simulations with different mass ratios and spin angles. We adapted the core neural network architecture for use with our additional aims.
            
            
              Results.
              We find that a strong inverse relationship exists between the mass ratio and the number of bars produced. We also identify two distinct phases in the bar formation process; (1) the initial, tidally induced formation pre-merger and (2) the destruction and/or regeneration of the bar during and after the merger.
            
            
              Conclusions.
              Mergers with low mass ratios and closely-aligned orientations are considerably more conducive to bar formation compared to equal-mass mergers. We demonstrate the flexibility of our deep learning approach by showing it is feasible to classify bars based on their formation mechanism.},

            This is the first paper in a series devoted to review the main properties of galaxies designated S0 in the Hubble classification system. Our aim is to gather abundant and, above all, robust information on the most relevant physical parameters of this poorly understood morphological type and their possible dependence on the environment, which could later be used to assess their possible formation channel(s). The adopted approach combines the characterization of the fundamental features of the optical spectra of \$68{\textbackslash}, 043\$ S0 with heliocentric z ≲ 0.1 with the exploration of a comprehensive set of their global attributes. A principal component analysis is used to reduce the huge number of dimensions of the spectral data to a low-dimensional space facilitating a bias-free machine-learning-based classification of the galaxies. This procedure has revealed that objects bearing the S0 designation consist, despite their similar morphology, of two separate subpopulations with statistically inconsistent physical properties. Compared to the absorption-dominated S0, those with significant nebular emission are, on average, somewhat less massive, more luminous with less concentrated light profiles, have a younger, bluer, and metal-poorer stellar component, and avoid high-galaxy-density regions. Noteworthy is the fact that the majority of members of this latter class, which accounts for at least a quarter of the local S0 population, show star formation rates and spectral characteristics entirely similar to those seen in late spirals. Our findings suggest that star-forming S0 might be less rare than hitherto believed and raise the interesting possibility of identifying them with plausible progenitors of their quiescent counterparts.},

They encode the image space equivalent of basis vectors that can be combined to describe the structural properties of large samples of galaxies in a massively reduced manner. As an illustration, we show how a sample of  10243 galaxies in the Hubble Space Telescope CANDELS survey can be represented by just 12 eigengalaxies. We show in some detail how this image space may be derived and tested. We also describe a probabilistic extension to PCA (PPCA) which enables the eigengalaxy framework to assign probabilities to galaxies. We present four practical applications of the probabilistic eigengalaxy framework that are particularly relevant for the next generation of large imaging surveys: we (i) show how low likelihood galaxies make for natural candidates for outlier detection; (ii) demonstrate how missing data can be predicted; (iii) show how a similarity search can be performed on exemplars; (iv) demonstrate how unsupervised clustering of objects can be implemented.}",

Once completed, we expect to have detailed morphological classifications for over 50,000 galaxies spanning 0 &lt; z &lt; 4 over all the fields, with classifications from 3 to 5 independent classifiers for each galaxy. Here, we present our detailed visual classification scheme, which was designed to cover a wide range of CANDELS science goals. This scheme includes the basic Hubble sequence types, but also includes a detailed look at mergers and interactions, the clumpiness of galaxies, k-corrections, and a variety of other structural properties. In this paper, we focus on the first field to be completed—GOODS-S, which has been classified at various depths. The wide area coverage spanning the full field (wide+deep+ERS) includes 7634 galaxies that have been classified by at least three different people. In the deep area of the field, 2534 galaxies have been classified by at least five different people at three different depths. With this paper, we release to the public all of the visual classifications in GOODS-S along with the Perl/Tk GUI that we developed to classify galaxies. We present our initial results here, including an analysis of our internal consistency and comparisons among multiple classifiers as well as a comparison to the Sérsic index. We find that the level of agreement among classifiers is quite good (&gt;70\% across the full magnitude range) and depends on both the galaxy magnitude and the galaxy type, with disks showing the highest level of agreement (&gt;50\%) and irregulars the lowest (&lt;10\%). A comparison of our classifications with the Sérsic index and rest-frame colors shows a clear separation between disk and spheroid populations. Finally, we explore morphological k-corrections between the V-band and H-band observations and find that a small fraction (84 galaxies in total) are classified as being very different between these two bands. These galaxies typically have very clumpy and extended morphology or are very faint in the V-band.}

title = {THE SEVENTH DATA RELEASE OF THE SLOAN DIGITAL SKY SURVEY},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series},
abstract = {This paper describes the Seventh Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), marking the completion of the original goals of the SDSS and the end of the phase known as SDSS-II. It includes 11,663 deg2 of imaging data, with most of the ∼2000 deg2 increment over the previous data release lying in regions of low Galactic latitude. The catalog contains five-band photometry for 357 million distinct objects. The survey also includes repeat photometry on a 120° long, 2.°5 wide stripe along the celestial equator in the Southern Galactic Cap, with some regions covered by as many as 90 individual imaging runs. We include a co-addition of the best of these data, going roughly 2 mag fainter than the main survey over 250 deg2. The survey has completed spectroscopy over 9380 deg2; the spectroscopy is now complete over a large contiguous area of the Northern Galactic Cap, closing the gap that was present in previous data releases. There are over 1.6 million spectra in total, including 930,000 galaxies, 120,000 quasars, and 460,000 stars. The data release includes improved stellar photometry at low Galactic latitude. The astrometry has all been recalibrated with the second version of the USNO CCD Astrograph Catalog, reducing the rms statistical errors at the bright end to 45 milliarcseconds per coordinate. We further quantify a systematic error in bright galaxy photometry due to poor sky determination; this problem is less severe than previously reported for the majority of galaxies. Finally, we describe a series of improvements to the spectroscopic reductions, including better flat fielding and improved wavelength calibration at the blue end, better processing of objects with extremely strong narrow emission lines, and an improved determination of stellar metallicities.}

At every optical luminosity and redshift log L2 keV is, to a good approximation, normally distributed with dispersion ∼0.40, at least brightwards of the median X-ray luminosity. This median X-ray luminosity of quasars is a power law of optical luminosity with index ∼0.53 for L2500 and ∼0.30 for L[O III]. RLQs are systematically brighter than RQQs by about a factor of 2 at given optical luminosity. The zero-points of these relations increase systematically with redshift, possibly in different ways for RLQs and RQQs. Evolution is particularly strong at low redshift and if the optical luminosity is characterized by L[O III].

    abstract = "{We use a complete sample of about 140 000 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to study the size distribution of galaxies and its dependence on their luminosity, stellar mass and morphological type. The large SDSS data base provides statistics of unprecedented accuracy. For each type of galaxy, the size distribution at given luminosity (or stellar mass) is well described by a log-normal function, characterized by its median  and dispersion σln R. For late-type galaxies, there is a characteristic luminosity at Mr,0∼−20.5 (assuming h= 0.7) corresponding to a stellar mass M0∼ 1010.6 M⊙. Galaxies more massive than M0 have  and σln R∼ 0.3, while less massive galaxies have  and σln R∼ 0.5. For early-type galaxies, the  relation is significantly steeper, , but the σln R–M relation is similar to that of bright late-type galaxies. Faint red galaxies have sizes quite independent of their luminosities. We use simple theoretical models to interpret these results. The observed  relation for late-type galaxies can be explained if the fraction of baryons that form stars is as predicted by the standard feedback model. Fitting the observed σln R–M relation requires in addition that the bulge/disc mass ratio be larger in haloes of lower angular momentum and that the bulge material transfers part of its angular momentum to the disc. This can be achieved if bulge formation occurs so as to maintain a marginally stable disc. For early-type galaxies, the observed σln R–M relation is inconsistent with formation through single major mergers of present-day discs. It is consistent with formation through repeated mergers, if the progenitors have properties similar to those of faint ellipticals or Lyman break galaxies and merge from relatively strongly bound orbits.}",

title = {Spectroscopic Target Selection in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey: The Main Galaxy Sample},
journal = {The Astronomical Journal},
abstract = {We describe the algorithm that selects the main sample of galaxies for spectroscopy in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) from the photometric data obtained by the imaging survey. Galaxy photometric properties are measured using the Petrosian magnitude system, which measures flux in apertures determined by the shape of the surface brightness profile. The metric aperture used is essentially independent of cosmological surface brightness dimming, foreground extinction, sky brightness, and the galaxy central surface brightness. The main galaxy sample consists of galaxies with r-band Petrosian magnitudes r ≤ 17.77 and r-band Petrosian half-light surface brightnesses μ50 ≤ 24.5 mag arcsec-2. These cuts select about 90 galaxy targets per square degree, with a median redshift of 0.104. We carry out a number of tests to show that (1) our star-galaxy separation criterion is effective at eliminating nearly all stellar contamination while removing almost no genuine galaxies, (2) the fraction of galaxies eliminated by our surface brightness cut is very small (∼0.1\%), (3) the completeness of the sample is high, exceeding 99\%, and (4) the reproducibility of target selection based on repeated imaging scans is consistent with the expected random photometric errors. The main cause of incompleteness is blending with saturated stars, which becomes more significant for brighter, larger galaxies. The SDSS spectra are of high enough signal-to-noise ratio (S/N &gt; 4 per pixel) that essentially all targeted galaxies (99.9\%) yield a reliable redshift (i.e., with statistical error less than 30 km s-1). About 6\% of galaxies that satisfy the selection criteria are not observed because they have a companion closer than the 55″ minimum separation of spectroscopic fibers, but these galaxies can be accounted for in statistical analyses of clustering or galaxy properties. The uniformity and completeness of the galaxy sample make it ideal for studies of large-scale structure and the characteristics of the galaxy population in the local universe.}

Through applying a variety of improvement strategies and comparing the results of a large number of experiments, an algorithm named RegNetX-CBAM3 with good performance is proposed to implement the task of automatic classification of galaxy morphology. The RegNetX-CBAM3 algorithm is applied along with many other popular neural networks in the data set consisting of the Extraction de Formes Idéalisées de Galaxies en Imagerie (EFIGI) catalogue and Galaxy Zoo 2 (GZ2), and there are the following seven types of the galaxy morphology in this data set: lenticular, barred spiral, spiral, completely round smooth, in-between smooth, cigar-shaped smooth, and irregular, respectively. Experimental results show that the RegNetX-CBAM3 algorithm achieves the state-of-the-art results over many other excellent algorithms, with the accuracy of 0.9202, purity of 0.9214, completeness of 0.9213, F1-score of 0.9210, and AUC value of 0.9827 on the test set. Moreover, we establish a method of probability confidence calculation considering the classification bias. The confidence degree of galaxies calculated by this method is basically consistent with that of GZ2 and EFIGI, which demonstrates the rationality of this method and also proves that the RegNetX-CBAM3 algorithm can effectively classify galaxies. Therefore, the RegNetX-CBAM3 algorithm can be applied to effectively solve the problem of automatic classification of galaxy morphology. On EFIGI data, the performance of the RegNetX-CBAM3 algorithm does not change substantially with the redshift range. In addition, it should be noted that the use of deep neural networks, manual annotation, and data enhancement may cause classification bias in galaxy images.}",

Monochromatic i-band DES images with linear, logarithmic, and gradient scales, matched with debiased visual classifications from the Galaxy Zoo 1 (GZ1) catalogue, are used to train our CNN models. With a training set including bright galaxies (16 ≤ i \\&lt; 18) at low redshift (z \\&lt; 0.25), we furthermore investigate the limit of the accuracy of our predictions applied to galaxies at fainter magnitude and at higher redshifts. Our final catalogue covers magnitudes 16 ≤ i \\&lt; 21, and redshifts z \\&lt; 1.0, and provides predicted probabilities to two galaxy types – ellipticals and spirals (disc galaxies). Our CNN classifications reveal an accuracy of over 99 per cent for bright galaxies when comparing with the GZ1 classifications (i \\&lt; 18). For fainter galaxies, the visual classification carried out by three of the co-authors shows that the CNN classifier correctly categorizes discy galaxies with rounder and blurred features, which humans often incorrectly visually classify as ellipticals. As a part of the validation, we carry out one of the largest examinations of non-parametric methods, including ∼100 ,000 galaxies with the same coverage of magnitude and redshift as the training set from our catalogue.

journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {We use machine learning to identify in color images of high-redshift galaxies an astrophysical phenomenon predicted by cosmological simulations. This phenomenon, called the blue nugget (BN) phase, is the compact star-forming phase in the central regions of many growing galaxies that follows an earlier phase of gas compaction and is followed by a central quenching phase. We train a convolutional neural network (CNN) with mock “observed” images of simulated galaxies at three phases of evolution— pre-BN, BN, and post-BN—and demonstrate that the CNN successfully retrieves the three phases in other simulated galaxies. We show that BNs are identified by the CNN within a time window of ∼0.15 Hubble times. When the trained CNN is applied to observed galaxies from the CANDELS survey at z = 1–3, it successfully identifies galaxies at the three phases. We find that the observed BNs are preferentially found in galaxies at a characteristic stellar mass range, 109.2–10.3 M⊙ at all redshifts. This is consistent with the characteristic galaxy mass for BNs as detected in the simulations and is meaningful because it is revealed in the observations when the direct information concerning the total galaxy luminosity has been eliminated from the training set. This technique can be applied to the classification of other astrophysical phenomena for improved comparison of theory and observations in the era of large imaging surveys and cosmological simulations.}

We model this by introducing the notion of robust regret, which measures the regret only on rounds that are not outliers. The aim for the learner is to achieve small robust regret, without knowing where the outliers are. If the outliers are chosen adversarially, we show that a simple filtering strategy on extreme gradients incurs O(k) overhead compared to the usual regret bounds, and that this is unimprovable, which means that k needs to be sublinear in the number of rounds. We further ask which additional assumptions would allow for a linear number of outliers. It turns out that the usual benign cases of independently, identically distributed (i.i.d.) observations or strongly convex losses are not sufficient. However, combining i.i.d. observations with the assumption that outliers are those observations that are in an extreme quantile of the distribution, does lead to sublinear robust regret, even though the expected number of outliers is linear.}

The advent of large-scale surveys has hastened the need to develop techniques for automated morphological classification. We train and test several convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures to classify the morphologies of galaxies in both a 3-class (elliptical, lenticular, and spiral) and a 4-class (+irregular/miscellaneous) schema with a data set of 14 034 visually classified SDSS images. We develop a new CNN architecture that outperforms existing models in both 3-way and 4-way classifications, with overall classification accuracies of 83 and 81 per cent, respectively. We also compare the accuracies of 2-way/binary classifications between all four classes, showing that ellipticals and spirals are most easily distinguished (\\&gt;98 per cent accuracy), while spirals and irregulars are hardest to differentiate (78 per cent accuracy). Through an analysis of all classified samples, we find tentative evidence that misclassifications are physically meaningful, with lenticulars misclassified as ellipticals tending to be more massive, among other trends. We further combine our binary CNN classifiers to perform a hierarchical classification of samples, obtaining comparable accuracies (81 per cent) to the direct 3-class CNN, but considerably worse accuracies in the 4-way case (65 per cent). As an additional verification, we apply our networks to a small sample of Galaxy Zoo images, obtaining accuracies of 92, 82, and 77 per cent for the binary, 3-way, and 4-way classifications, respectively.}",

title = {Galaxy Light Profile Convolutional Neural Networks (GaLNets). I. Fast and Accurate Structural Parameters for Billion-galaxy Samples},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {Next-generation large sky surveys will observe up to billions of galaxies for which basic structural parameters are needed to study their evolution. This is a challenging task that, for ground-based observations, is complicated by seeing-limited point-spread functions (PSFs). To perform a fast and accurate analysis of galaxy surface brightness, we have developed a family of supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to derive Sérsic profile parameters of galaxies. This work presents the first two Galaxy Light profile CNNs (GaLNets) of this family. The first one is trained using galaxy images only (GaLNet-1), and the second is trained with both galaxy images and the local PSF (GaLNet-2). We have compared the results from GaLNets with structural parameters (total magnitude, effective radius, Sérsic index, etc.) derived from a set of galaxies from the Kilo-Degree Survey by 2DPHOT as a representative of the “standard” PSF-convolved Sérsic fitting tools. The comparison shows that GaLNet-2 can reach an accuracy as high as that of 2DPHOT, while GaLNet-1 performs worse because it misses the information from the local PSF. Both GaLNets are three orders of magnitude faster than standard methods in terms of computational speed. This first application of CNNs to ground-based galaxy surface photometry shows that they are promising tools to perform parametric analyses of very large galaxy samples, like the ones expected from the Vera Rubin/LSST surveys. However, GaLNets can be easily modified for space observations from Euclid and the China Space Station Telescope.}

journal = {Research in Astronomy and Astrophysics},
abstract = {The Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) spectroscopic survey plans to deliver high-quality low-resolution (R &gt; 200) slitless spectra for hundreds of millions of targets down to a limiting magnitude of about 21 mag, covering a large survey area (17 500 deg2) and a wide wavelength range (255–1000 nm by three bands GU, GV, and GI). In this work, we use empirical spectra of the Next Generation Spectral Library to simulate the CSST stellar spectra at R = 250, and investigate their capabilities in measuring radial velocities. We find that velocity uncertainties depend strongly on effective temperature, weakly on metallicity for only FGK stars, and hardly on surface gravity. It is possible to deliver stellar radial velocities to a precision of about 3 km s−1 for AFGKM stars, and about 10 km s−1 for OB stars, at signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 100. Velocity uncertainties using single GU/GV/GI band spectra are also explored. Given the same SNR, the GU band performs best, the GV band the second best, and then the GI band. The effects of spectral normalization and the imperfect template on velocity measurements are investigated and found to be very weak. The uncertainties caused by wavelength calibration are considered and found to be moderate. Given the possible precision of radial velocities, the CSST spectroscopic survey can enable interesting science such as searching for hyper-velocity stars. Limitations of our results are also discussed.}

    abstract = "{We present quantified visual morphologies of approximately 48 000 galaxies observed in three Hubble Space Telescope legacy fields by the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) and classified by participants in the Galaxy Zoo project. 90 per cent of galaxies have z ≤ 3 and are observed in rest-frame optical wavelengths by CANDELS. Each galaxy received an average of 40 independent classifications, which we combine into detailed morphological information on galaxy features such as clumpiness, bar instabilities, spiral structure, and merger and tidal signatures. We apply a consensus-based classifier weighting method that preserves classifier independence while effectively down-weighting significantly outlying classifications. After analysing the effect of varying image depth on reported classifications, we also provide depth-corrected classifications which both preserve the information in the deepest observations and also enable the use of classifications at comparable depths across the full survey. Comparing the Galaxy Zoo classifications to previous classifications of the same galaxies shows very good agreement; for some applications, the high number of independent classifications provided by Galaxy Zoo provides an advantage in selecting galaxies with a particular morphological profile, while in others the combination of Galaxy Zoo with other classifications is a more promising approach than using any one method alone. We combine the Galaxy Zoo classifications of ‘smooth’ galaxies with parametric morphologies to select a sample of featureless discs at 1 ≤ z ≤ 3, which may represent a dynamically warmer progenitor population to the settled disc galaxies seen at later epochs.}",

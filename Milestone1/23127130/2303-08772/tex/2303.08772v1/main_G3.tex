\begin{abstract}
The virtualization of wireless networks enables new services to access network resources made available by the Network Operator (NO) through a Network Slicing market. The different service providers (SPs) have the opportunity to lease the network resources from the NO to constitute slices that address the demand of their specific network service. The goal of any SP is to maximize its service utility and minimize costs from leasing resources while facing uncertainties of the prices of the resources and the users' demand. In this paper, we propose a solution that allows the SP to decide its online reservation policy, which aims to maximize its service utility and minimize its cost of reservation simultaneously.  %This paper looks at how one SP can design an online reservation policy based on any feedback and prediction it receives from the NO.
We design the Optimistic Online Learning for Reservation (OOLR) solution, a decision algorithm built upon the Follow-the-Regularized Leader (FTRL), that incorporates key predictions to assist the decision-making process. Our solution achieves a $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound where $T$ represents the horizon. We integrate a prediction model into the OOLR solution and we demonstrate through numerical results the efficacy of the combined models' solution against the FTRL baseline.



%The softwarization of wireless networks paves the way to reservation-based models, like in cloud computing systems, where service providers (SPs) lease sliced resources from network operators. In our setting, an SP reserves resources owned by the NO and then orchestrates those resources into the slice that accommodates the demand. In this paper, we look how an SP can acquire resources available on the spot market, to maximize its performance, while satisfying its budget constraint, in dynamic settings. We consider different kind of uncertainties: the demand coming from the users, the pricing of spot resources,  the utility of the different resources and we make no assumptions about them. Using the constrained-OCO framework with time-varying constraints, we propose the Online Learning for Reservation (OLR) solution that achieves sublinear fit and regret in the case of non-stationary traces, and that has theoretical guarantees. We offer two extensions of practical importance, which improve the performance of our ORL solution and place it in a realistic setting.

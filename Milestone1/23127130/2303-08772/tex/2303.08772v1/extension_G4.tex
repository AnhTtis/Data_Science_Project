\section{Model Extension}

\subsection{Problem statement}
We envision the case where the NO fails to fulfill the SP request in its entirety but must still comply with at least a certain ratio of what has been requested. Formally, we multiply the elements of the request vector $\bm x_t$ with a vector $\bm \alpha_t$ whose items belong to the set $[\alpha,1]$, where the value of $\alpha$ is representative of the SLA (Service Level Agreement) the NO and the SP have agreed upon. Similarly, we multiply the request vector on the spot market $\bm y_t$ with a vector $\bm \beta_t$, whose items belong to $[\beta,1]$.

We redefine the problem as:
\begin{align}
(\mathbb P):\quad \max_{ \{\bm x_t,\{\bm y_t\}\}_{t=1}^T } & \sum_{t=1}^T \Big(V  a_t \log(( \Tilde{\bm x}_t + \Tilde{\bm y}_t)^\top \bm \theta_t + 1) \notag\\
&- (\bm p_t^\top \Tilde{\bm x}_t +\bm q_t^\top \Tilde{\bm y}_t) \Big) \label{prob-obj} \\
%\text{s.t.} \quad & \sum_{t=1}^T\Big(x_tp_t+\!\!\!\!\sum_{k=(t-1)K+1}^{tK}\!\!\!\!\!y_kq_k \Big) \leq B, \label{prob-const1} \\
\text{s.t.}\quad   \bm y_t\in &\Delta, \quad \forall t=1,\ldots,T,  \label{prob-const2} \\
	 \bm x_t \in &\Delta, \quad \forall t=1, \ldots, T. \label{prob-const3}\\
	 %\alpha \in &(0,1) \label{prob-const4}
\end{align}
where $\Tilde{\bm x}_t = \bm \alpha_t \odot \bm x_t$ and $\Tilde{\bm y}_t = \bm \beta_t \odot \bm y_t$. The notation $\odot$ corresponds to the element-wise multiplication of two vectors also called the Adamar product. The latter is a linear operator, as it is equivalent to the product $A \bm x_t$ ($B \bm y_t$), where $A$ ($B$) is a diagonal matrix whose elements are the items of the vector $\bm \alpha_t$ ($\bm \beta_t$).
Thus it conserves the convexity of the problem and we can still apply the same OOLR solution, that we rename OOLRext.

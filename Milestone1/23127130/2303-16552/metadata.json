    "abstract": "Vision is the most important sense for people, and it is also one of the main ways of cognition. As a result, people tend to utilize visual content to capture and share their life experiences, which greatly facilitates the transfer of information. Meanwhile, it also increases the risk of privacy violations, e.g., an image or video can reveal different kinds of privacy-sensitive information. Researchers have been working continuously to develop targeted privacy protection solutions, and there are several surveys to summarize them from certain perspectives. However, these surveys are either problem-driven, scenario-specific, or technology-specific, making it difficult for them to summarize the existing solutions in a macroscopic way. In this survey, a framework that encompasses various concerns and solutions for visual privacy is proposed, which allows for a macro understanding of privacy concerns from a comprehensive level. It is based on the fact that privacy concerns have corresponding adversaries, and divides privacy protection into three categories, based on computer vision (CV) adversary, based on human vision (HV) adversary, and based on CV \\& HV adversary. For each category, we analyze the characteristics of the main approaches to privacy protection, and then systematically review representative solutions. Open challenges and future directions for visual privacy protection are also discussed.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a damage detection method based on the train-induced responses of high-speed railway box girder. Under the coupling effects of bending and torsion, the traditional damage detection method based on the Euler beam theory cannot be applied. In this research, the box girder section is divided into different components based on the plate element analysis method. The strain responses were preprocessed based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method to remove the influence of train operation variation. The residual error of autoregressive (AR) model was used as a potential index of damage features. The optimal order of the model was determined based on Bayesian information criterion (BIC) criterion. Finally, the confidence boundary (CB) of damage features (DF) constituting outliers can be estimated by Gaussian inverse cumulative distribution function (ICDF). The numerical simulation results show that the proposed method in this paper can effectively identify, locate and quantify the damage, which verifies the accuracy of the proposed method. The proposed method effectively identifies the early damage of all components on the key section by using four strain sensors, and it is helpful for developing effective maintenance strategies for high-speed railway box girder.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the thulium atom has been cooled down to the temperature of Bose-Einstein condensation. While the condensate of the thulium atom has a lot of applications in quantum simulations and other areas of physics, it can also serve as a unique diagnostic tool for many atomic experiments. In the present study, the Bose-Einstein condensate of the thulium atom was successfully utilized to diagnose an optical lattice and detect unwanted reflections in the experiments with the 1064 nm optical lattice, which will further be used in a quantum gas microscope experiment.",

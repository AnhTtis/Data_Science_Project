    "abstract": "Phase-shifting electron holography is an excellent method to reveal electron wave phase information with very high phase sensitivity over a large range of spatial frequencies. It circumvents the limiting trade-off between fringe spacing and visibility of standard off-axis holography. Previous implementations have been limited by the independent drift of biprism and sample. We demonstrate here an advanced drift correction scheme for the hologram series that allow to obtain reliable phase information at the 1 Å information limit of the used Titan 80-300 kV environmental transmission electron microscope using a single biprism at moderate voltage of 250 V. The obtained phase and amplitude information is validated at a thin Pt sample by use of multislice image simulation with the frozen lattice approximation and shows excellent agreement. The presented method drastically reduces the hardware requirements and thus allows to achieve high resolution in off-axis holography in various instruments including those for in-situ applications. A software implementation for the acquisition, calibration and reconstruction is provided.",

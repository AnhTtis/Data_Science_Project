    "abstract": "Malware is the most significant threat to computer security. This paper aims to overview the malware detection field, focusing on the recent and promising hardware-based approach. This approach leverages the Hardware Performance Counters already available in modern processors and the power of Machine Learning, offering attractive advantages like resilience to disabling the protection, resilience to unknown malware, low complexity/overhead/cost, and run-time detection. The approach is deeply analyzed in light of a generic hardware-based detection framework. Some challenges related to the approach are presented: the necessary accuracy improvements, how to deal with the classification error, better correlating the hardware events behavior with the malware, and essential improvements on the hardware performance monitor.",

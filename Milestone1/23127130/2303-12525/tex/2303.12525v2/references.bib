Although there has been a lot of research on the development of DL-based mobile malware detection approaches, they were not reviewed in detail yet. This paper aims to identify, assess, and synthesize the reported articles related to the application of DL techniques for mobile malware detection. A Systematic Literature Review is performed in which we selected 40 journal articles for in-depth analysis. This SLR presents and categorizes these articles based on machine learning categories, data sources, DL algorithms, evaluation parameters {\&} approaches, feature selection techniques, datasets, and DL implementation platforms. The study also highlights the challenges, proposed solutions, and future research directions on the use of DL in mobile malware detection. This study showed that Convolutional Neural Networks and Deep Neural Networks algorithms are the most used DL algorithms. API calls, Permissions, and System Calls are the most dominant features utilized. Keras and Tensorflow are the most popular platforms. Drebin and VirusShare are the most widely used datasets. Supervised learning and static features are the most preferred machine learning and data source categories.},

@article{Liu:2022aa,
	abstract = {Malicious applications (particularly those targeting the Android platform) pose a serious threat to developers and end-users. Numerous research efforts have been devoted to developing effective approaches to defend against Android malware. However, given the explosive growth of Android malware and the continuous advancement of malicious evasion technologies like obfuscation and reflection, Android malware defense approaches based on manual rules or traditional machine learning may not be effective. In recent years, a dominant research field called deep learning (DL), which provides a powerful feature abstraction ability, has demonstrated a compelling and promising performance in a variety of areas, like natural language processing and computer vision. To this end, employing DL techniques to thwart Android malware attacks has recently garnered considerable research attention. Yet, no systematic literature review focusing on DL approaches for Android malware defenses exists. In this article, we conducted a systematic literature review to search and analyze how DL approaches have been applied in the context of malware defenses in the Android environment. As a result, a total of 132 studies covering the period 2014--2021 were identified. Our investigation reveals that, while the majority of these sources mainly consider DL-based Android malware detection, 53 primary studies (40.1\%) design defense approaches based on other scenarios. This review also discusses research trends, research focuses, challenges, and future research directions in DL-based Android malware defenses.},

	abstract = {Deep Learning (DL) is a disruptive technology that has changed the landscape of cyber security research. Deep learning models have many advantages over traditional Machine Learning (ML) models, particularly when there is a large amount of data available. Android malware detection or classification qualifies as a big data problem because of the fast booming number of Android malware, the obfuscation of Android malware, and the potential protection of huge values of data assets stored on the Android devices. It seems a natural choice to apply DL on Android malware detection. However, there exist challenges for researchers and practitioners, such as choice of DL architecture, feature extraction and processing, performance evaluation, and even gathering adequate data of high quality. In this survey, we aim to address the challenges by systematically reviewing the latest progress in DL-based Android malware detection and classification. We organize the literature according to the DL architecture, including FCN, CNN, RNN, DBN, AE, and hybrid models. The goal is to reveal the research frontier, with the focus on representing code semantics for Android malware detection. We also discuss the challenges in this emerging field and provide our view of future research opportunities and directions.},

This survey aims at providing an overview on the way machine learning has been used so far in the context of malware analysis in Windows environments, i.e. for the analysis of Portable Executables. We systematize surveyed papers according to their objectives (i.e., the expected output), what information about malware they specifically use (i.e., the features), and what machine learning techniques they employ (i.e., what algorithm is used to process the input and produce the output). We also outline a number of issues and challenges, including those concerning the used datasets, and identify the main current topical trends and how to possibly advance them. In particular, we introduce the novel concept of malware analysis economics, regarding the study of existing trade-offs among key metrics, such as analysis accuracy and economical costs.},

	abstract = {Zero-day malware is malware that has never been seen before or is so new that no anti-malware software can catch it. This novelty and the lack of existing mitigation strategies make zero-day malware challenging to detect and defend against. In recent years, deep learning has become the dominant and leading branch of machine learning in various research fields, including malware detection. Considering the significant threat of zero-day malware to cybersecurity and business continuity, it is necessary to identify deep learning techniques that can somehow be effective in detecting or classifying such malware. But so far, such a comprehensive review has not been conducted. In this article, we study deep learning techniques in terms of their ability to detect or classify zero-day malware. Based on our findings, we propose a taxonomy and divide different zero-day resistant, deep malware detection and classification techniques into four main categories: unsupervised, semi-supervised, few-shot, and adversarial resistant. We compare the techniques in each category in terms of various factors, including deep learning architecture, feature encoding, platform, detection or classification functionality, and whether the authors have performed a zero-day evaluation. We also provide a summary view of the reviewed papers and discuss their main characteristics and challenges.},

	abstract = {Malware is one of the most frequent cyberattacks, with its prevalence growing daily across the network. Malware traffic is always asymmetrical compared to benign traffic, which is always symmetrical. Fortunately, there are many artificial intelligence techniques that can be used to detect malware and distinguish it from normal activities. However, the problem of dealing with large and high-dimensional data has not been addressed enough. In this paper, a high-performance malware detection system using deep learning and feature selection methodologies is introduced. Two different malware datasets are used to detect malware and differentiate it from benign activities. The datasets are preprocessed, and then correlation-based feature selection is applied to produce different feature-selected datasets. The dense and LSTM-based deep learning models are then trained using these different versions of feature-selected datasets. The trained models are then evaluated using many performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score). The results indicate that some feature-selected scenarios preserve almost the same original dataset performance. The different nature of the used datasets shows different levels of performance changes. For the first dataset, the feature reduction ratios range from 18.18% to 42.42%, with performance degradation of 0.07% to 5.84%, respectively.

HPC have been used for program characterization and testing, system testing and performance evaluation, and as side channels. We propose to use HPCs for static and dynamic integrity checking of programs.. The main advantage of HPC-based integrity checking is that it is almost free in terms of hardware cost; HPCs are built into almost all processors. The runtime performance overhead is minimal because we use the operating system for integrity checking, which is called anyway for process scheduling and other interrupts. Our preliminary results confirm that HPC very efficiently detect program modifications with very low cost.},

These works gather traces of HPCs for a variety of applications (both malicious and non-malicious) and then apply machine learning to train a detector to distinguish between benign applications and malware. In this work, we provide a more comprehensive analysis of the applicability of using machine learning and HPCs for a specific subset of malware: kernel rootkits.We design five synthetic rootkits, each providing a single piece of rootkit functionality, and execute each while collecting HPC traces of its impact on a specific benchmark application. We then apply machine learning feature selection techniques in order to determine the most relevant HPCs for the detection of these rootkits. We identify 16 HPCs that are useful for the detection of hooking based roots, and also find that rootkits employing direct kernel object manipulation (DKOM) do not significantly impact HPCs. We then use these synthetic rootkit traces to train a detection system capable of detecting new rootkits it has not seen previously with an accuracy of over 99\%. Our results indicate that HPCs have the potential to be an effective tool for rootkit detection, even against new rootkits not previously seen by the detector.},

	abstract = {Recent works have shown promise in detecting malware programs based on their dynamic microarchitectural execution patterns. Compared to higher-level features like OS and application observables, these microarchitectural features are efficient to audit and harder for adversaries to control directly in evasion attacks. These data can be collected at low overheads using widely available hardware performance counters (HPC) in modern processors. In this work, we advance the use of hardware supported lower-level features to detecting malware exploitation in an anomaly-based detector. This allows us to detect a wider range of malware, even zero days. As we show empirically, the microarchitectural characteristics of benign programs are noisy, and the deviations exhibited by malware exploits are minute. We demonstrate that with careful selection and extraction of the features combined with unsupervised machine learning, we can build baseline models of benign program execution and use these profiles to detect deviations that occur as a result of malware exploitation. We show that detection of real-world exploitation of popular programs such as IE and Adobe PDF Reader on a Windows/x86 platform works well in practice. We also examine the limits and challenges in implementing this approach in face of a sophisticated adversary attempting to evade anomaly-based detection. The proposed detector is complementary to previously proposed signature-based detectors and can be used together to improve security.},

	abstract = {The ever-increasing prevalence of malware has led to the explorations of various detection mechanisms. Several recent works propose to use Hardware Performance Counters (HPCs) values with machine learning classification models for malware detection. HPCs are hardware units that record low-level micro-architectural behavior, such as cache hits/misses, branch (mis)prediction, and load/store operations. However, this information does not reliably capture the nature of the application, i.e. whether it is benign or malicious. In this paper, we claim and experimentally support that using the micro-architectural level information obtained from HPCs cannot distinguish between benignware and malware. We evaluate the fidelity of malware detection using HPCs. We perform quantitative analysis using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to systematically select micro-architectural events that have the most predictive powers. We then run 1,924 programs, 962 benignware and 962 malware, on our experimental setups. We achieve 83.39\%, 84.84\%, 83.59\%, 75.01\%, 78.75\%, and 14.32\% F1-score (a metric of detection rates) of Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Adaboost, Neural Net (NN), and Naive Bayes, respectively. We cross-validate our models 1,000 times to show the distributions of detection rates in various models. Our cross-validation analysis shows that many of the experiments produce low F1-scores. The F1-score of models in DT, RF, KNN, Adaboost, NN, and Naive Bayes is 80.22\%, 81.29\%, 80.22\%, 70.32\%, 35.66\%, and 9.903\%, respectively. To further highlight the incapability of malware detection using HPCs, we show that one benignware (Notepad++) infused with malware (ransomware) cannot be detected by HPC-based malware detection.},

	abstract = {In recent years, multiple techniques have been proposed to defend computing systems against control-oriented attacks that hijack the control-flow of the victim program. Data-only attacks, on the other hand, are a less common and more subtle type of exploit which are more difficult to detect using traditional mitigation techniques that target control-oriented attacks. In this paper we introduce a novel methodology for the detection of data-only attacks through modeling the execution behavior of an application using low-level hardware information collected as a data series during execution. One unique aspect of the proposed methodology is that it uses a compilation flag based approach to collect hardware counts, eliminating the need for manual code instrumentation. Another unique aspect is the introduction of a data compression algorithm as the classifier. Using several representative real-world data-only exploits, our experiments show that data-only attacks can be detected with high accuracy using the proposed methodology. We also performed analysis on how to select the most relevant hardware events for the detection of the studied data-only attack, as well as a quantitative study of hardware events' sensitivity to interference.},

@inproceedings{Chen_2005,
	abstract = {Most memory corruption attacks and Internet worms follow a familiar pattern known as the control-data attack. Hence, many defensive techniques are designed to protect program control flow integrity. Although earlier work did suggest the existence of attacks that do not alter control flow, such attacks are generally believed to be rare against real-world software. The key contribution of this paper is to show that non-control-data attacks are realistic. We demonstrate that many real-world applications, including FTP, SSH, Telnet, and HTTP servers, are vulnerable to such attacks. In each case, the generated attack results in a security compromise equivalent to that due to the control-data attack exploiting the same security bug. Non-control-data attacks corrupt a variety of application data including user identity data, configuration data, user input data, and decision-making data. The success of these attacks and the variety of applications and target data suggest that potential attack patterns are diverse. Attackers are currently focused on control-data attacks, but it is clear that when control flow protection techniques shut them down, they have incentives to study and employ non-control-data attacks. This paper emphasizes the importance of future research efforts to address this realistic threat.},

This detector is envisioned as a first line of defense that prioritizes the application of more expensive and more accurate software detectors. Critical to such a framework is the detection performance of the hardware detector. In this paper, we explore the use of both specialized detectors and ensemble learning techniques to improve performance of the hardware detector. The proposed detectors reduce the false positive rate by more than half compared to a single detector, while increasing the detection rate. We also contribute approximate metrics to quantify the detection overhead, and show that the proposed detectors achieve more than 11x reduction in overhead compared to a software only detector 1.87x compared to prior work, while improving detection time. Finally, we characterize the hardware complexity by extending an open core and synthesizing it on an FPGA platform, showing that the overhead is minimal.},

Embedded malware refers to harmful stealthy cyber attacks in which the malicious code is hidden within benign applications and remains undetected by traditional malware detection approaches. In HMD methods, when the HPC data is directly fed into a machine learning classifier, embedding malicious code inside the benign applications leads to contamination of HPC information, as the collected HPC features combine benign and malware microarchitectural events together. To address this challenge, in this paper we propose StealthMiner, a specialized time series machine learning approach to accurately detect embedded malware at run-time using branch instructions feature, the most prominent microarchitectural feature.

@article{Sayadi_2021,
	abstract = {According to recent security analysis reports, malicious software (a.k.a. malware) is rising at an alarming rate in numbers, complexity, and harmful purposes to compromise the security of modern computer systems. Recently, malware detection based on low-level hardware features (e.g., Hardware Performance Counters (HPCs) information) has emerged as an effective alternative solution to address the complexity and performance overheads of traditional software-based detection methods. Hardware-assisted Malware Detection (HMD) techniques depend on standard Machine Learning (ML) classifiers to detect signatures of malicious applications by monitoring built-in HPC registers during execution at run-time. Prior HMD methods though effective have limited their study on detecting malicious applications that are spawned as a separate thread during application execution, hence detecting stealthy malware patterns at run-time remains a critical challenge. Stealthy malware refers to harmful cyber attacks in which malicious code is hidden within benign applications and remains undetected by traditional malware detection approaches. In this paper, we first present a comprehensive review of recent advances in hardware-assisted malware detection studies that have used standard ML techniques to detect the malware signatures. Next, to address the challenge of stealthy malware detection at the processor's hardware level, we propose StealthMiner, a novel specialized time series machine learning-based approach to accurately detect stealthy malware trace at run-time using branch instructions, the most prominent HPC feature. StealthMiner is based on a lightweight time series Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCN) model that automatically identifies potentially contaminated samples in HPC-based time series data and utilizes them to accurately recognize the trace of stealthy malware. Our analysis demonstrates that using state-of-the-art ML-based malware detection methods is not effective in detecting stealthy malware samples since the captured HPC data not only represents malware but also carries benign applications' microarchitectural data. The experimental results demonstrate that with the aid of our novel intelligent approach, stealthy malware can be detected at run-time with 94\% detection performance on average with only one HPC feature, outperforming the detection performance of state-of-the-art HMD and general time series classification methods by up to 42\% and 36\%, respectively.},

As an alternative, attacks targeting non-control data do not require diverting the application's control flow during an attack. Although it is known that such data-oriented attacks can mount significant damage, no systematic methods to automatically construct them from memory errors have been developed. In this work, we develop a new technique called data-flow stitching, which systematically finds ways to join data flows in the program to generate data-oriented exploits. We build a prototype embodying our technique in a tool called FLOWSTITCH that works directly on Windows and Linux binaries. In our experiments, we find that FLOWSTITCH automatically constructs 16 previously unknown and three known data-oriented attacks from eight real-world vulnerable programs. All the automatically-crafted exploits respect fine-grained CFI and DEP constraints, and 10 out of the 19 exploits work with standard ASLR defenses enabled. The constructed exploits can cause significant damage, such as disclosure of sensitive information (e.g., passwords and encryption keys) and escalation of privilege.},

It has been shown that such attacks can cause significant damage even in the presence of control-flow defense mechanisms. However, these threats have not been adequately addressed. In this survey article, we first map data-oriented exploits, including Data-Oriented Programming (DOP) and Block-Oriented Programming (BOP) attacks, to their assumptions/requirements and attack capabilities. Then, we compare known defenses against these attacks, in terms of approach, detection capabilities, overhead, and compatibility. It is generally believed that control flows may not be useful for data-oriented security. However, data-oriented attacks (especially DOP attacks) may generate side effects on control-flow behaviors in multiple dimensions (i.e., incompatible branch behaviors and frequency anomalies). We also characterize control-flow anomalies caused by data-oriented attacks. In the end, we discuss challenges for building deployable data-oriented defenses and open research questions.},

@inproceedings{Ispoglou_2018,
	abstract = {With the widespread deployment of Control-Flow Integrity (CFI), control-flow hijacking attacks, and consequently code reuse attacks, are significantly more difficult. CFI limits control flow to well-known locations, severely restricting arbitrary code execution. Assessing the remaining attack surface of an application under advanced control-flow hijack defenses such as CFI and shadow stacks remains an open problem. We introduce BOPC, a mechanism to automatically assess whether an attacker can execute arbitrary code on a binary hardened with CFI/shadow stack defenses. BOPC computes exploits for a target program from payload specifications written in a Turing-complete, high-level language called SPL that abstracts away architecture and program-specific details. SPL payloads are compiled into a program trace that executes the desired behavior on top of the target binary. The input for BOPC is an SPL payload, a starting point (e.g., from a fuzzer crash) and an arbitrary memory write primitive that allows application state corruption. To map SPL payloads to a program trace, BOPC introduces Block Oriented Programming (BOP), a new code reuse technique that utilizes entire basic blocks as gadgets along valid execution paths in the program, i.e., without violating CFI or shadow stack policies. We find that the problem of mapping payloads to program traces is NP-hard, so BOPC first reduces the search space by pruning infeasible paths and then uses heuristics to guide the search to probable paths. BOPC encodes the BOP payload as a set of memory writes. We execute 13 SPL payloads applied to 10 popular applications. BOPC successfully finds payloads and complex execution traces -- which would likely not have been found through manual analysis -- while following the target's Control-Flow Graph under an ideal CFI policy in 81% of the cases.},

@inproceedings{Schwartz_2020,
	abstract = {Code reuse attacks have been the subject of a substantial amount of research during the past decade. This research largely resulted from early work on Return-Oriented Programming (ROP), which showed that the then newly proposed Non-Executable Memory (NX) defense could be bypassed. More recently, the research community has been simultaneously investigating new defenses that are believed to thwart code reuse attacks, such as Control Flow Integrity (CFI), and defense-aware techniques for attacking these defenses, such as Data-Oriented Programming (DOP). Unfortunately, the feasibility of defense-aware attacks are very dependent on the behaviors of the attacked program, which makes it difficult for defenders to understand how much protection a defense such as CFI may provide. To better understand this, researchers have introduced automated defense-aware code reuse attack systems. Unfortunately, the handful of existing systems implement a single fixed, defense-specific strategy that is complex and cannot be used to consider other defenses.In this paper, we propose a generic framework for automatically discovering defense-aware code reuse attacks in executables. Unlike existing work, which utilizes hard-coded strategies for specific defenses, our framework can produce attacks for multiple defenses by analyzing the runtime behavior of the defense. The high-level insight behind our framework is that code reuse attacks can be defined as a state reachability problem, and that defenses prevent some transitions between states. We implement our framework as a tool named Limbo, which employs an existing binary concolic executor to solve the reachability problem. We evaluate Limbo and show that it excels when there is little code available for reuse, making it complementary to existing techniques. We show that, in such scenarios, Limbo outperforms existing systems that automate ROP attacks, as well as systems that automate DOP attacks in the presence of fine-grained CFI, despite having no special knowledge about ROP or DOP attacks.},

	abstract = {Recent advancements in Information Technology (IT) have engendered the rapid production of big data, as enormous volumes of data with high dimensional features grow exponentially in different fields. Therefore, dealing with high-dimensional data creates new challenges in terms of data processing efficiency and effectiveness. To address such challenges, Feature Selection (FS) is among the most utilized dimensionality reduction methods, which is helpful in reducing the high dimensionality of large-scale data by picking up a small subset of related and significant features and eliminating unrelated and redundant features in order to construct effective prediction models. This article provides a comprehensive review of the latest FS approaches in the context of big data along with a structured taxonomy, which categorizes the existing methods based on their nature, search strategy, evaluation process, and feature structure. Moreover, it presents a qualitative analysis of FS methods based on their objective, structure, search strategy, schema, learning task, strengths, and weaknesses. Further, a quantitative analysis is also performed to illustrate the number of publications related to FS based on the timeline, main category, and other sub-categories. An experimental study is also conducted comparing ten methods from different categories using twelve benchmark datasets from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository and Arizona State University (ASU) Feature Selection Repository to evaluate their performance in terms of (accuracy, precision, recall, F-measures, and the number of selected features). Finally, we highlight the research issues and open challenges related to FS to assist researchers in identifying future research directions.},

The objectives of feature selection include building simpler and more comprehensible models, improving data-mining performance, and preparing clean, understandable data. The recent proliferation of big data has presented some substantial challenges and opportunities to feature selection. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and structured overview of recent advances in feature selection research. Motivated by current challenges and opportunities in the era of big data, we revisit feature selection research from a data perspective and review representative feature selection algorithms for conventional data, structured data, heterogeneous data and streaming data. Methodologically, to emphasize the differences and similarities of most existing feature selection algorithms for conventional data, we categorize them into four main groups: similarity-based, information-theoretical-based, sparse-learning-based, and statistical-based methods. To facilitate and promote the research in this community, we also present an open source feature selection repository that consists of most of the popular feature selection algorithms (http://featureselection.asu.edu/). Also, we use it as an example to show how to evaluate feature selection algorithms. At the end of the survey, we present a discussion about some open problems and challenges that require more attention in future research.},

In this study we compare  feature selection methods on  public gene expression datasets for breast cancer prognosis, in terms of predictive performance, stability and functional interpretability of the signatures they produce. We observe that the feature selection method has a significant influence on the accuracy, stability and interpretability of signatures. Surprisingly, complex wrapper and embedded methods generally do not outperform simple univariate feature selection methods, and ensemble feature selection has generally no positive effect.

	abstract = {{Motivation: Biomarker discovery is an important topic in biomedical applications of computational biology, including applications such as gene and SNP selection from high-dimensional data. Surprisingly, the stability with respect to sampling variation or robustness of such selection processes has received attention only recently. However, robustness of biomarkers is an important issue, as it may greatly influence subsequent biological validations. In addition, a more robust set of markers may strengthen the confidence of an expert in the results of a selection method.Results: Our first contribution is a general framework for the analysis of the robustness of a biomarker selection algorithm. Secondly, we conducted a large-scale analysis of the recently introduced concept of ensemble feature selection, where multiple feature selections are combined in order to increase the robustness of the final set of selected features. We focus on selection methods that are embedded in the estimation of support vector machines (SVMs). SVMs are powerful classification models that have shown state-of-the-art performance on several diagnosis and prognosis tasks on biological data. Their feature selection extensions also offered good results for gene selection tasks. We show that the robustness of SVMs for biomarker discovery can be substantially increased by using ensemble feature selection techniques, while at the same time improving upon classification performances. The proposed methodology is evaluated on four microarray datasets showing increases of up to almost 30\\% in robustness of the selected biomarkers, along with an improvement of ∼15\\% in classification performance. The stability improvement with ensemble methods is particularly noticeable for small signature sizes (a few tens of genes), which is most relevant for the design of a diagnosis or prognosis model from a gene signature.Contact:  yvan.saeys@psb.ugent.beSupplementary information:  Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}},

	abstract = {Sparse linear models approximate target variable(s) by a sparse linear combination of input variables. The sparseness is realized through a regularization term. Since they are simple, fast, and able to select features, they are widely used in classification and regression. Essentially linear models are shallow feed-forward neural networks which have three limitations: (1) incompatibility to model non-linearity of features, (2) inability to learn high-level features, and (3) unnatural extensions to select features in multi-class case. Deep neural networks are models structured by multiple hidden layers with non-linear activation functions. Compared with linear models, they have two distinctive strengths: the capability to (1) model complex systems with non-linear structures, (2) learn high-level representation of features. Deep learning has been applied in many large and complex systems where deep models significantly outperform shallow ones. However, feature selection at the input level, which is very helpful to understand the nature of a complex system, is still not well-studied. In genome research, the cis-regulatory elements in non-coding DNA sequences play a key role in the expression of genes. Since the activity of regulatory elements involves highly interactive factors, a deep tool is strongly needed to discover informative features. In order to address the above limitations of shallow and deep models for selecting features of a complex system, we propose a deep feature selection model that (1) takes advantages of deep structures to model non-linearity and (2) conveniently selects a subset of features right at the input level for multi-class data. We applied this model to the identification of active enhancers and promoters by integrating multiple sources of genomic information. Results show that our model outperforms elastic net in terms of size of discriminative feature subset and classification accuracy.},

@article{DWFS,
	abstract = {Many scientific problems can be formulated as classification tasks. Data that harbor relevant information are usually described by a large number of features. Frequently, many of these features are irrelevant for the class prediction. The efficient implementation of classification models requires identification of suitable combinations of features. The smaller number of features reduces the problem's dimensionality and may result in higher classification performance. We developed DWFS, a web-based tool that allows for efficient selection of features for a variety of problems. DWFS follows the wrapper paradigm and applies a search strategy based on Genetic Algorithms (GAs). A parallel GA implementation examines and evaluates simultaneously large number of candidate collections of features. DWFS also integrates various filtering methods that may be applied as a pre-processing step in the feature selection process. Furthermore, weights and parameters in the fitness function of GA can be adjusted according to the application requirements. Experiments using heterogeneous datasets from different biomedical applications demonstrate that DWFS is fast and leads to a significant reduction of the number of features without sacrificing performance as compared to several widely used existing methods.

	abstract = {With the current trend of rapidly growing popularity of the Python programming language for machine learning applications, the gap between machine learning engineer needs and existing Python tools increases. Especially, it is noticeable for more classical machine learning fields, namely, feature selection, as the community attention in the last decade has mainly shifted to neural networks. This paper has two main purposes. First, we perform an overview of existing open-source Python and Python-compatible feature selection libraries, show their problems, if any, and demonstrate the gap between these libraries and the modern state of feature selection field. Then, we present new open-source scikit-learn compatible ITMO FS (Information Technologies, Mechanics and Optics University feature selection) library that is currently under development, explain how its architecture covers modern views on feature selection, and provide some code examples on how to use it with Python and its performance compared with other Python feature selection libraries.},

	abstract = {Malcode can be easily hidden in document files and go undetected by standard technology. We demonstrate this opportunity of stealthy malcode insertion in several experiments using a standard COTS Anti-Virus (AV) scanner. Furthermore, in the case of zero-day malicious exploit code, signature- based AV scanners would fail to detect such malcode even if the scanner knew where to look. We propose the use of statistical binary content analysis of files in order to detect suspicious anomalous file segments that may suggest insertion of malcode. Experiments are performed to determine whether the approach of n-gram analysis may provide useful evidence of a tainted file that would subsequently be subjected to further scmtiny. We further perform tests to determine whether known malcode can be easily distinguished from otherwise ``normal'' Windows executables, and whether self-encrypted files may be easy to spot. Our goal is to develop an efficient means by static content analysis of detecting suspect infected files. This approach may have value for scanning a large store of collected information, such as a database of shared documents. The preliminary experiments suggest the problem is quite hard requiring new research to detect stealthy malcode.},

	abstract = {Anomaly detection is an important problem that has been researched within diverse research areas and application domains. Many anomaly detection techniques have been specifically developed for certain application domains, while others are more generic. This survey tries to provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the research on anomaly detection. We have grouped existing techniques into different categories based on the underlying approach adopted by each technique. For each category we have identified key assumptions, which are used by the techniques to differentiate between normal and anomalous behavior. When applying a given technique to a particular domain, these assumptions can be used as guidelines to assess the effectiveness of the technique in that domain. For each category, we provide a basic anomaly detection technique, and then show how the different existing techniques in that category are variants of the basic technique. This template provides an easier and more succinct understanding of the techniques belonging to each category. Further, for each category, we identify the advantages and disadvantages of the techniques in that category. We also provide a discussion on the computational complexity of the techniques since it is an important issue in real application domains. We hope that this survey will provide a better understanding of the different directions in which research has been done on this topic, and how techniques developed in one area can be applied in domains for which they were not intended to begin with.},

	abstract = {Today's Web-enabled deluge of electronic data calls for automated methods of data analysis. Machine learning provides these, developing methods that can automatically detect patterns in data and then use the uncovered patterns to predict future data. This textbook offers a comprehensive and self-contained introduction to the field of machine learning, based on a unified, probabilistic approach. The coverage combines breadth and depth, offering necessary background material on such topics as probability, optimization, and linear algebra as well as discussion of recent developments in the field, including conditional random fields, L1 regularization, and deep learning. The book is written in an informal, accessible style, complete with pseudo-code for the most important algorithms. All topics are copiously illustrated with color images and worked examples drawn from such application domains as biology, text processing, computer vision, and robotics. Rather than providing a cookbook of different heuristic methods, the book stresses a principled model-based approach, often using the language of graphical models to specify models in a concise and intuitive way. Almost all the models described have been implemented in a MATLAB software package--PMTK (probabilistic modeling toolkit)--that is freely available online. The book is suitable for upper-level undergraduates with an introductory-level college math background and beginning graduate students.},

The model we study can be interpreted as a broad, abstract extension of the well-studied on-line prediction model to a general decision-theoretic setting. We show that the multiplicative weight-update Littlestone--Warmuth rule can be adapted to this model, yielding bounds that are slightly weaker in some cases, but applicable to a considerably more general class of learning problems. We show how the resulting learning algorithm can be applied to a variety of problems, including gambling, multiple-outcome prediction, repeated games, and prediction of points in Rn. In the second part of the paper we apply the multiplicative weight-update technique to derive a new boosting algorithm. This boosting algorithm does not require any prior knowledge about the performance of the weak learning algorithm. We also study generalizations of the new boosting algorithm to the problem of learning functions whose range, rather than being binary, is an arbitrary finite set or a bounded segment of the real line.},

	abstract = {Time series classification tries to mimic the human understanding of similarity. When it comes to long or larger time series datasets, state-of-the-art classifiers reach their limits because of unreasonably high training or testing times. One representative example is the 1-nearest-neighbor dynamic time warping classifier (1-NN DTW) that is commonly used as the benchmark to compare to. It has several shortcomings: it has a quadratic time complexity in the time series length and its accuracy degenerates in the presence of noise. To reduce the computational complexity, early abandoning techniques, cascading lower bounds, or recently, a nearest centroid classifier have been introduced. Still, classification times on datasets of a few thousand time series are in the order of hours. We present our Bag-Of-SFA-Symbols in Vector Space classifier that is accurate, fast and robust to noise. We show that it is significantly more accurate than 1-NN DTW while being multiple orders of magnitude faster. Its low computational complexity combined with its good classification accuracy makes it relevant for use cases like long or large amounts of time series or real-time analytics.},

In this paper, we try to clarify the discussion by evaluating prior work presenting HPC criticism and highlighting their implicit assumptions and the potential research opportunities created by them. We discovered that HPCs are particularly good at detecting malware that exploits architectural side-effects, but not as good as traditional detection approaches at detecting pure-software malware, such that detection approaches must be combined. We also identified that most of the controversy about HPCs originates from researchers not clearly stating which type of malware they were considering. Thus, we claim the need for a theory of maliciousness to better state malware threats and evaluate proposed defenses.},

In this paper, we report discrepancies on the values obtained from the PMU event monitors and the number of events expected based on PMU event description in the processor's official documentation. Discrepancies, which may be either due to actual errors or inaccurate specifications, make PMU readings unreliable. This is particularly problematic in consideration of the critical role played by event monitors for timing analysis in domains such as automotive and avionics. This paper proposes a systematic procedure for event monitor validation. We apply it to validate event monitors in the NVIDIA Xavier and TX2, and the Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC. We show that, while some event monitors count as expected, this is not the case for others whose discrepancies with expected values we analyze.},

	abstract = {Detection of malicious programs using hardware-based features has gained prominence recently. The tamper-resistant hardware metrics prove to be a better security feature than the high-level software metrics, which can be easily obfuscated. Hardware Performance Counters (HPC), which are inbuilt in most of the recent processors, are often the choice of researchers amongst hardware metrics. However, a lack of determinism in their counts, thereby affecting the malware detection rate, minimizes the advantages of HPCs. To overcome this problem, in our work, we propose a three-step methodology for fine-grained malware detection. In the first step, we extract the HPCs of each system call of an unknown program. Later, we make a dimensionality reduction of the fine-grained data to identify the components that have maximum variance. Finally, we use a machine learning based approach to classify the nature of the unknown program into benign or malicious. Our proposed methodology has obtained a 98.4\% detection rate, with a 3.1\% false positive. It has improved the detection rate significantly when compared to other recent works in hardware-based anomaly detection.},

	abstract = {Return-oriented programming is an effective code-reuse attack in which short code sequences ending in a ret instruction are found within existing binaries and executed in arbitrary order by taking control of the stack. This allows for Turing-complete behavior in the target program without the need for injecting attack code, thus significantly negating current code injection defense efforts (e.g., W⊕X). On the other hand, its inherent characteristics, such as the reliance on the stack and the consecutive execution of return-oriented gadgets, have prompted a variety of defenses to detect or prevent it from happening.In this paper, we introduce a new class of code-reuse attack, called jump-oriented programming. This new attack eliminates the reliance on the stack and ret instructions (including ret-like instructions such as pop+jmp) seen in return-oriented programming without sacrificing expressive power. This attack still builds and chains functional gadgets, each performing certain primitive operations, except these gadgets end in an indirect branch rather than ret. Without the convenience of using ret to unify them, the attack relies on a dispatcher gadget to dispatch and execute the functional gadgets. We have successfully identified the availability of these jump-oriented gadgets in the GNU libc library. Our experience with an example shellcode attack demonstrates the practicality and effectiveness of this technique.},

After describing these flaws in conventional definitions of code-injection attacks, this paper proposes a new definition, which is based on whether the symbols input to an application get used as (normal-form) values in the application's output. Because values are already fully evaluated, they cannot be considered "code" when injected. This simple new definition of code-injection attacks avoids the problems of existing definitions, improves our understanding of how and when such attacks occur, and enables us to evaluate the effectiveness of mechanisms for mitigating such attacks.},

@article{Kim_2014,
	abstract = {Memory isolation is a key property of a reliable and secure computing system--an access to one memory address should not have unintended side effects on data stored in other addresses. However, as DRAM process technology scales down to smaller dimensions, it becomes more difficult to prevent DRAM cells from electrically interacting with each other. In this paper, we expose the vulnerability of commodity DRAM chips to disturbance errors. By reading from the same address in DRAM, we show that it is possible to corrupt data in nearby addresses. More specifically, activating the same row in DRAM corrupts data in nearby rows. We demonstrate this phenomenon on Intel and AMD systems using a malicious program that generates many DRAM accesses. We induce errors in most DRAM modules (110 out of 129) from three major DRAM manufacturers. From this we conclude that many deployed systems are likely to be at risk. We identify the root cause of disturbance errors as the repeated toggling of a DRAM row's wordline, which stresses inter-cell coupling effects that accelerate charge leakage from nearby rows. We provide an extensive characterization study of disturbance errors and their behavior using an FPGA-based testing platform. Among our key findings, we show that (i) it takes as few as 139K accesses to induce an error and (ii) up to one in every 1.7K cells is susceptible to errors. After examining various potential ways of addressing the problem, we propose a low-overhead solution to prevent the errors},

	abstract = {This retrospective paper describes the RowHammer problem in dynamic random access memory (DRAM), which was initially introduced by Kim <italic>et al.</italic> at the ISCA 2014 Conference. RowHammer is a prime (and perhaps the first) example of how a circuit-level failure mechanism can cause a practical and widespread system security vulnerability. It is the phenomenon that repeatedly accessing a row in a modern DRAM chip causes bit flips in physically adjacent rows at consistently predictable bit locations. RowHammer is caused by a hardware failure mechanism called <italic>DRAM disturbance errors</italic>, which is a manifestation of circuit-level cell-to-cell interference in a scaled memory technology. Researchers from Google Project Zero demonstrated in 2015 that this hardware failure mechanism can be effectively exploited by user-level programs to gain kernel privileges on real systems. Many other follow-up works demonstrated other practical attacks exploiting RowHammer. In this paper, we comprehensively survey the scientific literature on RowHammer-based attacks as well as mitigation techniques to prevent RowHammer. We also discuss what other related vulnerabilities may be lurking in DRAM and other types of memories, e.g., NAND flash memory or phase change memory, that can potentially threaten the foundations of secure systems, as the memory technologies scale to higher densities. We conclude by describing and advocating a principled approach to memory reliability and security research that can enable us to better anticipate and prevent such vulnerabilities.},

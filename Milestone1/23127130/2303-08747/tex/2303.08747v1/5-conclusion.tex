\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We proposed an efficient method for utilizing density crops for aerial image detection. Our method is as simple to use as the uniform cropping approach widely used by practitioners. The training step simply adds an additional class called "density crop" to the detector whose labels are obtained from a crop labeling algorithm. The inference is performed in two steps, one on the original image and then on the up-scaled version of the high-quality crops detected from it. For both modifications, we re-purpose the original detector, thus alleviating the need for additional components, unlike existing approaches. Empirical results verify the superiority of our approach in terms of detection accuracy and ease of use. At present, the density crops are up-scaled to a fixed resolution. In the future, we plan to up-scale adaptively, respecting the density of the crops.

    "abstract": "The rank of a $d$-dimensional polytope $P$ is defined by $F-(d+1)$, where $F$ denotes the number of facets of $P$. In this paper, We focus on the toric rings of $(0,1)$-polytopes with small rank. We study their normality, the torsionfreeness of their divisor class groups and the classification of their isomorphism classes.",

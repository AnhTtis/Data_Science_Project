    "abstract": "Finding point configurations, that yield the maximum polarization (Chebyshev constant) is gaining interest in the field of geometric optimization. In the present article, we study the problem of unconstrained maximum polarization on compact sets. In particular, we discuss necessary conditions for local optimality, such as that a locally optimal configuration is always contained in the convex hull of the respective darkest points. Building on this, we propose two sequences of mixed-integer linear programs in order to compute lower and upper bounds on the maximal polarization, where the lower bound is constructive. Moreover, we prove the convergence of these sequences towards the maximal polarization.",

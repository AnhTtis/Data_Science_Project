    "abstract": "A bipartite spin system is proposed for which a fast transfer from one defined state into another exists. For sufficient coupling between the spins, this implements a bit-flipping mechanism which is much faster than that induced by tunneling. The states correspond in the semiclassical limit to equilibrium points with a stability transition from elliptic-elliptic stability to complex instability for increased coupling. The fast transfer is due to the spiraling characteristics of the complex unstable dynamics. Based on the classical system we find a universal scaling for the transfer time, which even applies in the deep quantum regime. By investigating a simple model system, we show that the classical stability transition is reflected in a fundamental change of the structure of the eigenfunctions.",

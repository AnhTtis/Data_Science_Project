    "abstract": "Here, we study the controllable optical responses in a two-cavity optomechanical system, especially on the $\\mathit{perfect}$ optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT) in the model which has never been studied before. The results show that the perfect OMIT can still occur even with a large mechanical damping rate, and at the perfect transparency window the long-lived slow light can be achieved. In addition, we find that the conversion between the perfect OMIT and optomechanically induced absorption can be easily achieved just by adjusting the driving field strength of the second cavity. We believe that the results can be used to control optical transmission in modern optical networks.",

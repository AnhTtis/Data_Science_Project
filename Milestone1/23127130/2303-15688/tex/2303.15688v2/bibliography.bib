doi = {10.1126/scirobotics.abm6597},
abstract = {Executing safe and precise flight maneuvers in dynamic high-speed winds is important for the ongoing commoditization of uninhabited aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, because the relationship between various wind conditions and its effect on aircraft maneuverability is not well understood, it is challenging to design effective robot controllers using traditional control design methods. We present Neural-Fly, a learning-based approach that allows rapid online adaptation by incorporating pretrained representations through deep learning. Neural-Fly builds on two key observations that aerodynamics in different wind conditions share a common representation and that the wind-specific part lies in a low-dimensional space. To that end, Neural-Fly uses a proposed learning algorithm, domain adversarially invariant meta-learning (DAIML), to learn the shared representation, only using 12 minutes of flight data. With the learned representation as a basis, Neural-Fly then uses a composite adaptation law to update a set of linear coefficients for mixing the basis elements. When evaluated under challenging wind conditions generated with the Caltech Real Weather Wind Tunnel, with wind speeds up to 43.6 kilometers/hour (12.1 meters/second), Neural-Fly achieves precise flight control with substantially smaller tracking error than stateof-the-art nonlinear and adaptive controllers. In addition to strong empirical performance, the exponential stability of Neural-Fly results in robustness guarantees. Last, our control design extrapolates to unseen wind conditions, is shown to be effective for outdoor flights with only onboard sensors, and can transfer across drones with minimal performance degradation. A drone adapts to dynamic wind conditions using deep neural networks in real time with stability guarantees.}}

abstract = {This paper provides a novel solution to the problem of robust model predictive control of constrained, linear, discrete-time systems in the presence of bounded disturbances. The optimal control problem that is solved online includes, uniquely, the initial state of the model employed in the problem as a decision variable. The associated value function is zero in a disturbance invariant set that serves as the ‘origin’ when bounded disturbances are present, and permits a strong stability result, namely robust exponential stability of the disturbance invariant set for the controlled system with bounded disturbances, to be obtained. The resultant online algorithm is a quadratic program of similar complexity to that required in conventional model predictive control.}

   abstract = {Conventional model predictive control implements a version of receding horizon control where uncertainty (in the form of model error, estimation error, or disturbances) is absent. Robustness against uncertainty usually requires minimisation over control policies rather than control sequences; this may be prohibitively difficult in the presence of hard constraints on controls and states. It is shown how robustness may be achieved by a relatively simple modification to any conventional model predictive controller that is guaranteed to be stabilising in the absence of uncertainty.},

In this paper we present a detailed comparison between two state-of-the-art model-based control techniques for  { {MAV}} trajectory tracking. A classical Linear Model Predictive Controller (LMPC) is presented and compared against a more advanced Nonlinear Model Predictive Controller (NMPC) that considers the full system model. In a careful analysis we show the advantages and disadvantages of the two implementations in terms of speed and tracking performance. This is achieved by evaluating hovering performance, step response, and aggressive trajectory tracking under nominal conditions and under external wind disturbances.}

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents the acados software package, a collection of solvers for fast embedded optimization intended for fast embedded applications. Its interfaces to higher-level languages make it useful for quickly designing an optimization-based control algorithm by putting together different algorithmic components that can be readily connected and interchanged. Since the core of acados is written on top of a high-performance linear algebra library, we do not sacrifice computational performance. Thus, we aim to provide both flexibility and performance through modularity, without the need to rely on automatic code generation, which facilitates maintainability and extensibility. The main features of acados are: efficient optimal control algorithms targeting embedded devices implemented in C, linear algebra based on the high-performance BLASFEO Frison (ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software (TOMS) 44: 1--30, 2018) library, user-friendly interfaces to Matlab and Python, and compatibility with the modeling language of CasADi Andersson (Mathematical Programming Computation 11: 136, 2019). acados is free and open-source software released under the permissive BSD 2-Clause license.},

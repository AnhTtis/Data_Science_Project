    "abstract": "The cooperative management of rice terraces in Bali reveals an interesting phenomenon that stems from the feedback loop between human decisions and the ecosystem process. In particular, spatial patterning is observed, which is heavily reliant on the farmer's decision to plant crops as well as the response from the physical environment like pest damage and water shortage. A recent study proposed an evolutionary game theoretic model to infer particular power laws governing this spatial patterning along the Bali region. In this paper, we show a snapshot of rice patches in Bali with colors to indicate the different stages of rice growth",

abstract={Frequency stability is key to the performance of nanoresonators. This stability is thought to reach a limit with the resonator's ability to resolve thermally induced vibrations. Although measurements and predictions of resonator stability usually disregard fluctuations in the mechanical frequency response, these fluctuations have recently attracted considerable theoretical interest. However, their existence is very difficult to demonstrate experimentally. Here, through a literature review, we show that all studies of frequency stability report values several orders of magnitude larger than the limit imposed by thermomechanical noise. We studied a monocrystalline silicon nanoresonator at room temperature and found a similar discrepancy. We propose a new method to show that this was due to the presence of frequency fluctuations, of unexpected level. The fluctuations were not due to the instrumentation system, or to any other of the known sources investigated. These results challenge our current understanding of frequency fluctuations and call for a change in practices.},

	abstract = {We propose an enlarged framework to study transformations that drive an underdamped Brownian particle in contact with a thermal bath from an equilibrium state to a new one in an arbitrarily short time. To this end, we make use of a time and space-dependent potential, that plays a dual role: confine the particle, and manipulate the system. In the special case of an isothermal compression or decompression of a harmonically trapped particle, we derive explicit protocols that perform this quick transformation, following an inverse engineering method. We focus on the properties of these protocols, which crucially depend on two key dimensionless numbers that characterize the relative values of the three timescales of the problem, associated with friction, oscillations in the confinement and duration of the protocol. In particular, we show that our protocols encompass the known overdamped version of this problem and extend it to any friction for decompression and to a large range of frictions for compression}

@article{Seifert2012,
abstract = {Stochastic thermodynamics as reviewed here systematically provides a framework for extending the notions of classical thermodynamics such as work, heat and entropy production to the level of individual trajectories of well-defined non-equilibrium ensembles. It applies whenever a non-equilibrium process is still coupled to one (or several) heat bath(s) of constant temperature. Paradigmatic systems are single colloidal particles in time-dependent laser traps, polymers in external flow, enzymes and molecular motors in single molecule assays, small biochemical networks and thermoelectric devices involving single electron transport. For such systems, a first-law like energy balance can be identified along fluctuating trajectories. For a basic Markovian dynamics implemented either on the continuum level with Langevin equations or on a discrete set of states as a master equation, thermodynamic consistency imposes a local-detailed balance constraint on noise and rates, respectively. Various integral and detailed fluctuation theorems, which are derived here in a unifying approach from one master theorem, constrain the probability distributions for work, heat and entropy production depending on the nature of the system and the choice of non-equilibrium conditions. For non-equilibrium steady states, particularly strong results hold like a generalized fluctuation-dissipation theorem involving entropy production. Ramifications and applications of these concepts include optimal driving between specified states in finite time, the role of measurement-based feedback processes and the relation between dissipation and irreversibility. Efficiency and, in particular, efficiency at maximum power can be discussed systematically beyond the linear response regime for two classes of molecular machines, isothermal ones such as molecular motors, and heat engines such as thermoelectric devices, using a common framework based on a cycle decomposition of entropy production. {\textcopyright} 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

pages={14436},
abstract={We propose a novel methodology to estimate parameters characterizing a weakly nonlinear Duffing oscillator represented by an optically levitating nanoparticle. The method is based on averaging recorded trajectories with defined initial positions in the phase space of nanoparticle position and momentum and allows us to study the transient dynamics of the nonlinear system. This technique provides us with the parameters of a levitated nanoparticle such as eigenfrequency, damping, coefficient of nonlinearity and effective temperature directly from the recorded transient particle motion without any need for external driving or modification of an experimental system. Comparison of this innovative approach with a commonly used method based on fitting the power spectrum density profile shows that the proposed complementary method is applicable even at lower pressures where the nonlinearity starts to play a significant role and thus the power spectrum density method predicts steady state parameters. The technique is applicable also at low temperatures and extendable to recent quantum experiments. The proposed method is applied on experimental data and its validity for one-dimensional and three-dimensional motion of a levitated nanoparticle is verified by extensive numerical simulations.},

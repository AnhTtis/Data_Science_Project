    "abstract": "We report on speeding up equilibrium recovery in the previously unexplored general case of the underdamped regime using an optically levitated particle. We accelerate the convergence towards equilibrium by an order of magnitude compared to the natural relaxation time. We then discuss the efficiency of the studied protocols, especially for a multidimensional system. These results pave the way for optimizing realistic nanomachines with application to sensing and developing efficient nano-heat engines.",

    "abstract": "The monotonicity of the scalar curvature of the state space equipped with the Bogoliubov-Kubo-Mori metric under more mixing a state is an important conjecture called the Petz conjecture. From the standpoint of quantum statistical mechanics, the quantum exponential family, a special submanifold of the state space, is central rather than the full state space. In this contribution, we investigate the monotonicity of the scalar curvature of the submanifold with respect to temperature for transverse-field Ising chains in various sizes and find that the monotonicity breaks down for the chains in finite sizes, whereas the monotonicity seems to hold if the chain is non-interacting or infinite-size. Our results suggest that finite-size effects can appear in the curvature through monotonicity with respect to majorization.",

              Materials discovery has become significantly facilitated and accelerated by high-throughput
              ab-initio
              computations. This ability to rapidly design interesting novel compounds has displaced the materials innovation bottleneck to the development of synthesis routes for the desired material. As there is no a fundamental theory for materials synthesis, one might attempt a data-driven approach for predicting inorganic materials synthesis, but this is impeded by the lack of a comprehensive database containing synthesis processes. To overcome this limitation, we have generated a dataset of “codified recipes” for solid-state synthesis automatically extracted from scientific publications. The dataset consists of 19,488 synthesis entries retrieved from 53,538 solid-state synthesis paragraphs by using text mining and natural language processing approaches. Every entry contains information about target material, starting compounds, operations used and their conditions, as well as the balanced chemical equation of the synthesis reaction. The dataset is publicly available and can be used for data mining of various aspects of inorganic materials synthesis.},

	abstract = {Collecting and analyzing the vast amount of information available in the solid-state chemistry literature may accelerate our understanding of materials synthesis. However, one major problem is the diﬃculty of identifying which materials from a synthesis paragraph are precursors or are target materials. In this study, we developed a two-step chemical named entity recognition model to identify precursors and targets, based on information from the context around material entities. Using the extracted data, we conducted a meta-analysis to study the similarities and diﬀerences between precursors in the context of solid-state synthesis. To quantify precursor similarity, we built a substitution model to calculate the viability of substituting one precursor with another while retaining the target. From a hierarchical clustering of the precursors, we demonstrate that the “chemical similarity” of precursors can be extracted from text data. Quantifying the similarity of precursors helps provide a foundation for suggesting candidate reactants in a predictive synthesis model.},

The bottleneck in high-throughput materials design has thus shifted to materials synthesis, which motivates our development of a methodology to automatically compile materials synthesis parameters across tens of thousands of scholarly publications using natural language processing techniques. To demonstrate our framework’s capabilities, we examine the synthesis conditions for various metal oxides across more than 12 thousand manuscripts. We then apply machine learning methods to predict the critical parameters needed to synthesize titania nanotubes via hydrothermal methods and verify this result against known mechanisms. Finally, we demonstrate the capacity for transfer learning by using machine learning models to predict synthesis outcomes on materials systems not included in the training set and thereby outperform heuristic strategies.},

The monoliths possess connected, open porosity with characteristic pore sizes of the order of 5-30 mm.

Morphological changes of Ta3N5 particles, depending on the synthetic method, starting materials, and nitridation conditions, were examined in detail. Flux-assisted nitridation was found to be a facile one-step route to a metal nitride with morphological control of the resulting particles. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation revealed that morphologically defined particles of Ta3N5 were obtained using Zn, NaCl, or Na2CO3 as a flux. Flux-assisted nitridation of TaCl5 with Zn or NaCl produced nearly monodisperse fine particles larger than a few tens of nanometers. The size of these particles could be controlled by variation of the nitridation temperature. Highly crystallized Ta3N5 particles with a rectangular parallelepiped shape were produced from TaCl5-NaCl or Ta 2O5-Na2CO3 mixtures by nitridation above 1123 K, because of the annealing effect of the flux. © 2010 American Chemical Society.},

In the present work, the oxynitride perovskite SrTaO2N was sintered with a BaCN2 flux at approximately 900 °C avoiding its thermal decomposition. The resulting solid product with a relative density of 68.9\% showed relative dielectric constants in the range from 68 to 90 with loss values less than 0.11, without the post-ammonolysis. The interior of the solids contained rectangular Sr1-xBaxTaO2N crystals for which 0.04 ≤ x ≤ 0.23 reflecting their euhedral form. These crystals were grown in molten BaCN2 from 20 to 100 times larger than the original SrTaO2N particles and had a maximum grain size of 3.7 μm. The Sr1-xBaxTaO2N precipitated on the surfaces of the residual SrTaO2N crystals that had partially dissolved in the BaCN2 flux. A compositional gradient from barium-rich to strontium-rich was observed in a single crystal of the product on going from the exterior to the interior.

	abstract = {Photocatalytic water splitting is a promising platform for clean and renewable energy. Photocatalysts that absorb visible light are critically needed to efficiently harness solar energy, and metal oxynitrides and nitrides have the potential to address this need owing to their narrower band gaps compared to oxides. The catalytic activity of these materials could be enhanced through the synthesis of structurally defined particles with reduced recombination sites and the preferential expression of catalytically active sites. This Perspective highlights recent progress and current challenges associated with the design and synthesis of metal (d0/d10) oxynitride and nitride particles with defined structural features for photocatalytic applications. Nitriding oxide templates with defined morphology and topotactic transformations of structurally defined templates are promising routes to metal oxynitrides and nitrides with shape control. Case studies show that such synthetic advances are often coupled with enhanced photocatalytic activity; however, greater synthetic control is still required to understand the structure-function relationships of these promising materials.},

BaNbO2N powder was first synthesized by heating a mixture of BaCO3 and Nb2O5 under NH3 flow. Following synthesis, the powder was again heated under NH3 flow but in the presence of a flux. In the case of a NaCl flux, highly crystalline cubic particles were obtained. On the other hand, a KCl flux led to the formation of truncated octahedral particles. Although particles with clear crystal habits were obtained, it was found that they were actually an aggregation of primary particles, all with the same crystal orientation. A systematic survey of the effect of the different fluxes revealed that the type of cation in the flux played a major role in determining the morphology of the BaNbO2N particles. It was also revealed that a vaporized flux was also effective in changing the particle morphology.},

The results indicate that with the addition of BaF2 flux, the particle morphology becomes regular and size distribution narrows and the phase purity of BaSi2O2N2:Eu2+ phosphor can be improved effectively. The photoluminescence intensity of BaSi2O2N2:Eu2+ phosphor with BaF2 as flux gets enhanced obviously, which is much higher than that of Na2CO3, NH4Cl and without flux. The optimum content of BaF2 flux is 4 wt\%, and the maximum photoluminescence intensity of the BaSi2O2N2:Eu2+ phosphor prepared with BaF2 flux rises to 141\%, meanwhile, the phosphors with BaF2 flux exhibits low thermal quenching.

The valence states of cations, the bond covalency and the energy of the electronic states can be tuned by the introduction of nitrogen as a consequence of its lower electronegativity, higher electronic polarisability and higher formal anion charge relative to oxygen.

	abstract = {Low-temperature soft chemical synthesis routes to transition-metal nitrides are of interest as an alternative to conventional high-temperature ammonolysis reactions involving large volumes of chemotoxic NH3 gas. One such method is the reaction between metal oxides and NaNH2 at ca. 200 °C to yield the counterpart nitrides; however, there remains uncertainty regarding the reaction mechanism and product phase assemblage (in particular, noncrystalline components). Here, we extend the chemical tool box and mechanistic understanding of such reactions, demonstrating the nitridation of Fe3O4 by reaction with NaNH2 at 170-190 °C, via a pseudomorphic reaction. The more reduced Fe3O4 precursor enabled nitride formation at lower temperatures than the previously reported equivalent reaction with Fe2O3. The product phase assemblage, characterized by X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, and 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy, comprised 49-59 mol \% ϵ-Fe2+xN, accompanied by 29-39 mol \% FeO1-xNx and 8-14 mol \% γ″-FeN. The oxynitride phase was apparently noncrystalline in the recovered product but could be crystallized by heating at 180 °C. Although synthesis of transition-metal nitrides is achieved by reaction of the counterpart oxide with NaNH2, it is evident from this investigation that the product phase assemblage may be complex, which could prove a limitation if the objective is to produce a single-phase product with well-defined electrical, magnetic, or other physical properties for applications. However, the significant yield of the FeO1-xNx oxynitride phase identified in this study opens the possibility for the synthesis of metastable oxynitride phases in high yield, by reaction of a metal oxide substrate with NaNH2, with either careful control of H2O concentration in the system or postsynthetic hydrolysis and crystallization.},

The optical band gaps, between 3.5 and 4.3 eV, were estimated from UV-vis data using the Kubelka-Munk function under assumption of a direct band gap. Temperature-dependent powder X-ray diffraction showed a phase transformation of the M0.75PO4 (M = Zr, Hf) compounds to ambient pressure polymorphs at 780 (Zr) and 900 °C (Hf). The preparation of the nitrogen containing compounds exemplifies the systematic access to the new class of group 4 nitridophosphates granted by high-pressure metathesis.

The polycrystalline samples have been characterized by chemical analysis, x-ray and neutron diffraction (NPD), Mössbauer spectroscopy and magnetic measurements. They exhibit a tetragonal structure with a=5.5959(1) Å, c=7.9024(2) Å, V=247.46(2) Å 3 for Sr 2FeMoO 5.7N 0.3; and a=5.6202(2) Å, c=7.9102(4) Å, V=249.85(2) Å 3 for Sr 2FeMoO 5N; space group I4/m, Z=2. The nitridation process seems to extraordinarily improve the long-range Fe/Mo ordering, achieving 95\% at moderate temperatures of 750 °C. The analysis of high resolution NPD data, based on the contrast existing between the scattering lengths of O and N, shows that both atoms are located at (O,N)2 anion substructure corresponding to the basal ab plane of the perovskite structure, whereas the O1 site is fully occupied by oxygen atoms. The evolution of the 〈FeO〉 and 〈MoO〉 distances suggests a shift towards a configuration close to Fe 4(3d 4, S=2):Mo 5(4d 1, S=1/2). The magnetic susceptibility shows a ferrimagnetic transition with a reduced saturation magnetization compared to Sr 2FeMoO 6, due to the different nature of the magnetic double exchange interactions through FeNMoNFe paths in contrast to the stronger FeOMoOFe interactions. Also, the effect observed by low-temperature NPD seems to reduce the ordered Fe moments and enhance the Mo moments, in agreement with the evolution of the oxidation states, thus decreasing the saturation magnetization. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {The crystal structure of Li7[MnVN4] was re-determined. Isolated tetrahedral [MnVN4]7- ions are arranged with lithium cations to form a superstructure of the CaF2 anti-type (P43n, No. 218, a = 956.0(1) pm, Z = 8). According to measurements of the magnetic susceptibility, the manganese (tetrahedral coordination) is in a d2 S = 1 state. Thermal treatment of Li7[MnVN4] under argon in the presence of elemental lithium at various temperatures leads to Li24[Mn111N3]3N2Li 5[(Li1-xMnx)N]3, and Li2[(Li1-xMn1x)N] respectively. Li24[Mn111N3]3N2 (P31c, No. 163, a = 582.58(6) pm, c = 1784.1(3) pm, Z = 4/3) crystallizes in a trigonal unit cell, containing slightly, but significantly nonplanar trigonal [MnN3]6- units with C3v symmetry. Measurements of the magnetic susceptibility reveal a d4 S = 1 spin-state for the manganese (trigonal coordination). Nonrelativistic spin-polarized DFT calculations with different molecular models lead to the conclusion that restrictions in the Li-N substructure are responsible for the distortion from planarity of the [Mn111N3]6-. Li5[(Li1-xMnx)N]3 (x = 0.59(1), P62m, No. 189, a = 635.9(3) pm, c = 381.7(2) pm, Z = 1) is an isotype of Li5[(Li1-xNixN]3 with manganese in an average oxidation state of about + 1.6. The crystal structure is a defect variant of the α-Li3N structure type with the transition metal in linear coordination by nitrogen. Li2[(Li1-xMn1x)N] (x = 0.67(1), P6/mmm, No. 191, a = 371.25(4) pm, c = 382.12(6) pm, Z = 1) crystallizes in the α-Li3N = Li2[LiN] structure with partial substitution of the linearly nitrogen-coordinated Li-species by manganese(I). Measurements of the magnetic susceptibility are consistent with manganese (linear coordination) in a low-spin d6 S = 1 state.},

	abstract = {Oxynitride MnTaO2N exhibits a helical spin order in contrast to the isostructural oxide MnTiO3 with a G-type antiferromagnetism. To understand the role of the nitride ions on the magnetism, in this study, we theoretically investigated the structural and magnetic properties of MnTaO2N. Band calculations based on the density functional theory revealed that besides the most stable anion coordinations of cis-MO4N2 octahedra (M = Mn and Ta), the other coordinations such as trans-MO4N2, MO3N3, and MO5N are also considered to coexist due to the small total energy difference. This results in random existence of the nitride ions in MnTaO2N. The magnetic properties were investigated using the Heisenberg model to quantify the coupling energy (J) between Mn 3d5 local moments. Interestingly, the average J of the Mn-N-Mn bonds (J1N) was four times larger than that of the Mn-O-Mn bonds (J1O), mainly due to the covalent nature of Mn-N bonds. In comparison to MnTiO3, which contains only one type of magnetic interaction, J1O, MnTaO2N has various kinds of magnetic interactions due to the random existence of the nitride ions. In addition, the J1O value became comparable to the next-nearest-neighbor interaction (J2). These results caused spin frustration, which is a prerequisite to the emergence of the helical spin order in MnTaO2N.},

The oxynitride crystallizes in a cubic unit cell (space group Pm 3- m) as revealed by neutron and x-ray diffraction measurements. The polycrystalline material shows weakly temperature dependent electrical resistivity and low glasslike heat conductivity, both reflecting the unusual strength of the scattering processes in the charge carrier transport. Based on the positive Seebeck coefficient values, holes are identified as the dominating charge carriers in SrMoO2 N. Down to 150 K, the magnetic susceptibility is temperature independent and explained as enhanced Pauli paramagnetism (∼ 10-4 emu mol-1 Oe-1). The absolute value of its magnetic susceptibility is, however, half of that for SrMoO3. Simultaneously, the lower Sommerfeld coefficient γ measured for the oxynitride confirms the lower density of states near the Fermi level for SrMoO2 N compared to SrMoO3. At low temperature, both SrMoO2 N and SrMoO3 show Curie paramagnetism superimposed to the temperature independent Pauli paramagnetism and an anomaly at T=54 K. This anomaly is attributed to the presence of molecular oxygen in the material, while the Curie upturn is likely associated with a small amount of paramagnetic centers. © 2009 American Institute of Physics.},

Today, compounds with multiple anions beyond the single-oxide ion, such as oxyhalides and oxyhydrides, offer a new materials platform from which superior functionality may arise. Here we review the recent progress, status, and future prospects and challenges facing the development and deployment of mixed-anion compounds, focusing mainly on oxide-derived materials. We devote attention to the crucial roles that multiple anions play during synthesis, characterization, and in the physical properties of these materials. We discuss the opportunities enabled by recent advances in synthetic approaches for design of both local and overall structure, state-of-the-art characterization techniques to distinguish unique structural and chemical states, and chemical/physical properties emerging from the synergy of multiple anions for catalysis, energy conversion, and electronic materials.},

Nitrides show more positive free energies of formation than oxides because of the higher stability of N2 molecule with respect to O2 and the unfavourable electron affinity of nitrogen compared to oxygen. However the stability of oxynitrides is higher than for nitrides, and they easily form from oxides in presence of reactive gases as NH3. In addition to ammonolysis several synthetic strategies have been developed in the last years leading to the stabilization of relevant materials with a variety of structures.

A discussion of prevalent defects, both detrimental and beneficial, is followed by a survey of synthesis techniques and their interplay with metastability.

	abstract = {Lithium, as the lightest metallic element, forms a wide range of compounds of increasing importance as functional materials. This is especially true in an energy storage and conversion context, for example, where high energy density and high lithium ion mobility provide the drivers behind technologies such as rechargeable batteries and hydrogen storage. As a small, monovalent, mobile cation, Li+, is amenable structurally to a variety of coordination environments and its ability to readily occupy vacancies and interstitial positions lends it to a rich insertion and intercalation chemistry and the flexibility to form a myriad of structure types across a large stoichiometric range. This flexibility is as prevalent in nitrides as in oxides and other inorganic solids and lithium forms a larger number of ternary and higher compounds with nitrogen than any other single metal. Nevertheless, there are clear trends in the crystal chemistry of lithium nitrides and patterns to the bonding within these structures; key structure types and motifs dominate. Hence, not only does it become possible to anticipate composition-structure relationships in the synthesis of new nitrides, but also materials design and prescribed properties from magnetism through semiconducting and optical properties to superionic conductivity becomes a realistic prospect. This review presents a comprehensive account of the crystal chemistry of ternary and higher lithium nitrides across the periodic table and highlights the opportunities for materials design from the emerging understanding of structure-property relationships in these compounds. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Crystallographic and electronic structures of Nb-, Mo-, Ta-, and W-based layered oxides, oxynitrides, and nitrides were analyzed to elucidate the structural relationship between layered oxides and nitrides consisting of octahedral and trigonal-prismatic layers. The electron density, as derived by synchrotron X-ray analysis of LiNbO2 and Ta5-x(O,N)6, showed orbital overlaps between Nb-Nb and Ta-Ta metals in the trigonal layers. Computational calculations based on DFT exhibited that these overlaps stabilized these structures by lowering the hybridization states composed of the dxy, dx2-y2, and dz2 orbitals below the Fermi level. Crystal structures and formation energies suggest that tuning the Fermi level through the substitutions and vacancies of the cation/anion sites determines the structural preferences of the coordination. The properties and syntheses of these compounds are briefly described.

	abstract = {We present a combined experimental and theoretical investigation targeted at the thermochemical properties of a series of alkaline-earth metal carbodiimides. Their Gibbs energies and decomposition temperatures were calculated on the basis of phonons derived from density functional theory. The theoretical decomposition temperatures arrive at 1270, 1224, and 1185 K for CaNCN, α-SrNCN, and tetragonal BaNCN, respectively. Only the melt of tetragonal BaNCN is maintained at â1173 K, which is slightly below its calculated decomposition temperature. Experimentally, the melt of BaNCN did not decompose below 1273 K. On the contrary, both CaNCN and α-SrNCN partially decompose by forming a mixture of their carbides, metals, and nitrogen. The calculated Gibbs energies also show that the tetragonal phase of BaNCN is more stable than the rhombohedral one. We conclude that the melt of BaNCN is useful in the crystal growth of oxynitride perovskites such as BaTaO2N.},

Based on symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we map out a phase diagram of topological order in the parameter space of alloy concentration and crystalline symmetry, where the intrinsic MgTa2N3 with the highest symmetry hosts the Dirac semimetal phase, which transforms into the triple-point and then the Weyl semimetal phases with increasing Nb concentration that lowers the crystalline symmetries.

	abstract = {ZnGeN2 and other heterovalent ternary semiconductors have important potential applications in optoelectronics, but ordering of the cation sublattice, which can affect the band gap, lattice parameters, and phonons, is not yet well understood. Here the effects of growth and processing conditions on the ordering of the ZnGeN2 cation sublattice were investigated using x-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. Polycrystalline ZnGeN2 was grown by exposing solid Ge to Zn and NH3 vapors at temperatures between 758 °C and 914 °C. Crystallites tended to be rod-shaped, with growth rates higher along the c-axis. The degree of ordering, from disordered, wurtzite-like x-ray diffraction spectra to orthorhombic, with space group Pna21, increased with increasing growth temperature, as evidenced by the appearance of superstructure peaks and peak splittings in the diffraction patterns. Annealing disordered, low-temperature-grown ZnGeN2 at 850 °C resulted in increased cation ordering. Growth of ZnGeN2 on a liquid Sn–Ge–Zn alloy at 758 °C showed an increase in the tendency for cation ordering at a lower growth temperature, and resulted in hexagonal platelet-shaped crystals. The trends shown here may help to guide understanding of the synthesis and characterization of other heterovalent ternary nitride semiconductors as well as ZnGeN2.},

However, many other possible wurtzite-derived ternary nitrides have not been reported, and hence their optical and electrical properties remain unknown. Here, we report on Zn2SbN3-the first Sb-based nitride and a photoactive semiconductor. Surprisingly, Zn2SbN3 contains Sb in the highest (5+) oxidation state, and in the unusual tetrahedral coordination. This new Zn2SbN3 material has a solar-matched 1.6-1.7 eV band gap and shows near-band-edge room-temperature photoluminescence, demonstrating its promise as an optoelectronic semiconductor. Finally, Zn2SbN3 can be synthesized at low temperature under a wide range of processing conditions, despite being metastable according to theoretical calculations.

Computational calculations based on DFT exhibited that these overlaps stabilized these structures by lowering the hybridization states composed of the dxy, dx2-y2, and dz2 orbitals below the Fermi level. Crystal structures and formation energies suggest that tuning the Fermi level through the substitutions and vacancies of the cation/anion sites determines the structural preferences of the coordination.

In this regard, the hardly explored compound class of nitridoaluminates affords a new material with superior luminescence properties. Doped with Eu2+, Sr[LiAl3 N4] emerged as a new high-performance narrow-band red-emitting phosphor material, which can efficiently be excited by GaN-based blue LEDs. Owing to the highly efficient red emission at λmax ∼ 650 nm with a full-width at half-maximum of ∼1,180cm-1 (∼50 nm) that shows only very low thermal quenching ({\textbackslash}textgreater95\% relative to the quantum efficiency at 200 °C), a prototype phosphor-converted LED (pc-LED), employing Sr[LiAl3 N 4]:Eu2+ as the red-emitting component, already shows an increase of 14\% in luminous efficacy compared with a commercially available high colour rendering index (CRI) LED, together with an excellent colour rendition (Ra 8 = 91, R9 = 57). Therefore, we predict great potential for industrial applications in high-power white pc-LEDs. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

In an Ar atmosphere ScTaN2 decomposes above T = 1250 K and in a N2 atmosphere above T = 2000 K under release of N2 to form δ-ScN and β-Ta2N. The crystal structure (space group P63/mmc, No. 194, a = 305.34(3) pm, c = 1056.85(9) pm, Z = 2) was refined on the basis of X-ray and neutron powder diffraction data. It comprises alternating layers of ScN6/3 octahedra and trigonal TaN6/3 prisms, which are also observed in the binary nitrides δ-ScN and υ-TaN, respectively. A small degree of anti-site defects (about 5\%) was detected. Only a small solubility of ScN in ϵ-TaN was observed, while the solubility of TaN in δ-ScN is ≥10 mol \% at T= 1820 K. ScTaN2 is a diamagnetic small gap semiconductor or a semimetal, as inferred from magnetization and electrical resistivity measurements, consistent with band structure calculations. Chemical bonding analyses with the COHP method yield significant covalent Ta-Ta interactions. Topological analyses of the electron localization function reveal unexpected Ta-Ta three-center bonding basins within seemingly empty trigonal prisms of the TaN6/3 layers.},

	abstract = {Copper nitrides are defect-tolerant semiconductors with properties that are promising for solar energy conversion applications. Currently, there are few known ternary copper nitride materials. Here, we synthesized a previously unreported CuNbN2 using an ion-exchange reaction and subsequently determined its properties. CuNbN2 has a layered delafossite-type structure with NbN6 octahedra arranged in layers separated by linear N-Cu-N bonds. Experimental measurements and theoretical calculations agree that CuNbN2 has a 1.3-1.4 eV optical absorption threshold; theory also indicates that the lowest energy indirect band gap is 0.9 eV. The calculated CuNbN2 electron and hole effective masses are quite isotropic (mout /min = 1.3-2.1) and low (m = 0.3-0.7 me), as for the layered crystal structure. On the basis of these results, we propose a new lattice-matched delafossite tandem solar cell approach with Cu(Nb,Ta)N2 absorbers, p-type CuAlO2 contacts, and n-type ZnO contacts. Interestingly, first-principles calculations indicate that CuNbN2 is thermodynamically unstable with respect to disproportionation, yet the successful synthesis and potentially useful photovoltaic properties of this metastable material are possible. We theoretically examine a wide range of ternary copper nitrides for thermodynamic stability and optoelectronic properties with the goal of accessing their potential for solar energy conversion. It is found that the majority of these materials are thermodynamically unstable but that some of them should have properties that are promising for solar energy conversion applications and thus are worth experimental synthesis attempts.},

	abstract = {An approximate method for predicting the feasibility of synthesis of ternary nitrides from appropriate oxides and ammonia gas is outlined. The known thermodynamic data for binary oxides and nitrides may be a helpful guide in predicting the formation of ternary nitrides by ammonolysis of ternary oxides. When the difference between the free energy of formation of the ternaries from the binary oxides (AGf{\textasciicircum}O)) and binary nitrides (AG{\textasciicircum}CN)) is small, the predictions are expected to be reliable. Such considerations suggest that ternary oxides containing the most electropositive metals (alkaline, alkaline earth, rare earth) will not form ternary nitrides by ammonolysis but perhaps will form oxynitrides or decompose to the electropositive metal oxide/hydroxide and binary transition-metal nitride. When the metals in the ternary oxide are from group V or greater, ternary nitride formation by reaction with ammonia is likely. We have developed anew high-temperature calorimetric procedure for determining the standard enthalpies of formation of ternary nitrides and applied it to: L1M0N2, Na3WN3, and Na3W03N. The standard enthalpies of formation: AHf°(LiMoN2) = -386.0 ± 6.4 kJ/mol, AHf°(Na3WN3) = -358.7 db 53.3 kJ/mol and A/if°(Na3W03N) = Introduction},

With this method, nitridation of micrometer-sized oxide particles kept their initial morphologies, but the size of the primary particles decreased. The thermodynamic driving force is considered to be the conversion of oxides to sodium hydroxide, and the kinetic of nitridation is improved by the decrease of particle size and the low melting point of NaNH2. This technique as developed here has the advantages of low reaction temperature, reduced consumption of ammonia, employing nonspecialized equipment, and providing facile control of the reactions for producing nitrides from oxides.},

The rapid combustion reaction yields ternary rocksalt γ-TMxMo1-xN0.5 nanoparticles (TM = Mn, Fe, Co) in just a few seconds. We calculate from DFT that these disordered ternary molybdenum nitrides are thermodynamically stable under the high-temperatures at which they form but are remnantly metastable when quenched to ambient conditions. Introduction of Mn, Fe, and Co into γ-Mo2N is found to change its magnetic properties and to enhance its oxygen reduction catalytic activities.

	abstract = {Radiofrequency (RF) nitrogen plasma sources are commonly used for the growth of III-nitrides by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. Their output mainly consists of a mixture of atomic nitrogen and metastable excited molecules. The relative concentration of these species as a function of RF power and nitrogen gas flow rate has been investigated by plasma optical emission spectroscopy. It is shown that the concentration of excited molecular nitrogen species is monotonically increasing with both parameters while the concentration of nitrogen atoms is almost independent of the nitrogen gas flow rate and increases monotonically with the coupled RF power. As a result of this functional dependence, the plasma source can be tuned to produce mainly excited nitrogen molecules or a mixture of excited molecules and atomic nitrogen. Comparison of the growth rates of gallium nitride films grown under different operating conditions of the RF source with the optical spectroscopy data shows that the metastable excited nitrogen molecules component of the source is the predominant factor contributing in the III-nitrides growth. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, large scale production of high quality crystals is possible, due to comparatively simple scalability of the experimental set-up. The ammonothermal method is defined as employing a heterogeneous reaction in ammonia as one homogenous fluid close to or in supercritical state. Three types of milieus may be applied during ammonothermal synthesis: ammonobasic, ammononeutral or ammonoacidic, evoked by the used starting materials and mineralizers, strongly influencing the obtained products. There is little known about the dissolution and materials transport processes or the deposition mechanisms during ammonothermal crystal growth.

This approach identifies as-yet-unreported CaZn2N2 that has earth-abundant components, smaller carrier effective masses than gallium nitride and a tunable direct bandgap suited for light emission and harvesting. High-pressure synthesis realizes this phase, verifying the predicted crystal structure and band-edge red photoluminescence. In total, we propose 21 promising systems, including Ca2ZnN2, Ba2ZnN2 and Zn2PN3, which have not been reported as semiconductors previously.

	abstract = {Rapid solid-state metathesis (SSM) reactions are used to synthesize a series of refractory transition-metal nitrides. Exothennic reactions of metal halides with Li3N and/or NaN3 produce the mononitrides (TiN, ZrN, HfN, NbN, and TaN) as crystalline powders. The partial substitution of sodium azide for lithium nitride favors the formation of nitrogen-rich phases. In some cases, achieving a high reaction temperature and large internally generated nitrogen gas pressure enables the formation of nitride phases normally only synthesized at high temperatures and pressures (e.g. cubic NbN and TaN). Powder X-ray diffraction, magnetic susceptibility, electron microscopy, thermal and elemental analysis are used to characterize the compounds. All of the mononitrides are cubic with an NaCl structure (except TaN which also contains a hexagonal phase) and have lattice parameters that are consistent with nearly stoichiometric products. The superconducting transition temperatures for ZrN (8.5 K) and NbN (15.5 K) are also indicative of metal to nitrogen ratios near unity. These rapid reactions produce crystallites with average sizes near 500 A (as determined from X-ray line broadening) with size variation possible through changes in the reaction conditions. Differential scanning calorimetry and in situ reaction temperature measurements on the ZrN system indicate that initiation occurs when one precursor undergoes a phase change or decomposes. The result is a rapid self-propagating reaction which reaches temperatures of nearly 1370 "C within half of a second of initiation followed by rapid cooling to near room temperature within 30 s. The measured maximum reaction temperature agrees well with a theoretical value (1408 "C) calculated assuming an adiabatic system.},

NH3 has been widely used but requires a very high V III ratio and provides a very low concentration of N species other than itself during decomposition. Though the understanding of the MOVPE processes required more refined methods than an equilibrium thermodynamic analysis, the minimization of the Gibbs free energy of the gaseous system at the growth temperature provides pertinent information about the nature of active species. Such a thermodynamic analysis brings some insight into the efficiency of nitrogen precursors. Species produced by thermal decomposition of a standard N precursor as NH3 are compared to those obtained with N2H4 and N(C2H5)3. Preliminary experiments using N(C2H5)3 as nitrogen precursor are reported. The epitaxial growth of AlN on sapphire has been achieved whereas the tentative growth of GaN results in the deposition of Ga droplets. N precursors like N(C2H5)3, although suitable for the deposition of nitrides does not provide significant improvements, in comparison with NH3. Thermal activation (using a hot filament) or microwave production of active N species seems to provide a significant proportion of highly reactive chemical species. © 1995.},

	abstract = {ï¿½ 2017 Zwirner and Ziblat. Natural killer (NK) cells are characterized by their ability to detect and induce apoptosis of susceptible target cells and by secretion of immunoregulatory cytokines such as IFN-γ. Activation of these effector functions is triggered upon recognition of tumor and pathogen (mostly virus)-infected cells and because of a bidirectional cross talk that NK cells establish with other cells of myeloid origin such as dendritic cells (DC) and macrophages. A common characteristic of these myeloid cells is their ability to secrete different members of the IL-12 family of cytokines such as IL-12, IL-23, and IL-27 and cytokines such as IL-15 and IL-18. Although the effect of IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18 has been characterized, the effect of IL-23 and IL-27 on NK cells (especially human) remains ill-defined. Particularly, IL-27 is a cytokine with dual functions as it has been described as pro- and as anti-inflammatory in different experimental settings. Recent evidence indicates that this cytokine indeed promotes human NK cell activation, IFN-γ secretion, NKp46-dependent NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and antibody (Ab)-dependent NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) against monoclonal Ab-coated tumor cells. Remarkably, IL-27 also primes NK cells for IL-18 responsiveness, enhancing these functional responses. Consequently, IL-27 acts as a pro-inflammatory cytokine that, in concert with other DC-derived cytokines, hierarchically contributes to NK cells activation and effector functions, which likely contributes to foster the adaptive immune response in different physiopathological conditions.},

	abstract = {Multi-temperature thermal plasmas have often to be considered to account for the nonequilibrium effects. Recently André et al. have developed the calculation of concentrations in a multi-temperature plasma by artificially separating the partition functions into a product by assuming that the excitation energies are those of the lower levels (electronic, vibration, and rotation). However, at equilibrium, differences, increasing with temperature, can be observed between partition functions calculated rigorously and with their method. This paper presents a modified method where it has been assumed that the preponderant rotational energy is that of the vibrational level v=0 of the ground electronic state and the preponderant vibrational energy is that of the ground electronic state. The internal partition function can then be expressed as a product of series expressions. At equilibrium for N2 and N+2 partition functions the values calculated with our method differ by less than 0.1\% from those calculated rigorously. The calculation has been limited to three temperatures: heavy species Th, electrons Te, and vibrational Tv temperatures. The plasma composition has been calculated by minimizing the Gibbs free enthalpy with the steepest descent numerical technique. The nonequilibrium properties have been calculated using the method of Devoto, modified by Bonnefoi and Aubreton.

	abstract = {This paper proposes a modified pseudoequilibrium calculation, which gives almost the same results as those of kinetic calculations to determine the composition of hydrogen and nitrogen plasmas at atmospheric pressure. The computing time is two to three orders of magnitude faster than that of the kinetic calculations. First, according to experimental results, a relationship between the electron temperature Te and the heavy species one Th has been proposed. The ratio Te/Th varies as a function of the logarithm of the ratio ne/nmaxe, nmaxe being the electron density in the plasma core for which equilibrium is achieved (nmaxe ∼1023). The kinetic calculations have been performed assuming the microreversibility where the backward kinetic rate coefficient Kb is calculated by kd/kb = Kx, where kd is the direct kinetic coefficient and Kx the molar fraction equilibrium constant. When electrons are involved in both direct and backward reactions, kd and Kx are expressed as functions of Te. However, when the direct reaction involves electrons while the backward one is due to collisions between heavy species (or the reverse), a temperature T* between Te and Th is introduced. T* is determined as a function of the ratio of the electron flux to that of neutral species in such a way that T* = Te for ne {\textbackslash}textgreater 1023 and T* = Th for low values ne(ne {\textbackslash}textless 1015 m-3). Compared to hydrogen, the nitrogen composition exhibits a very abrupt variation between 6000 and 6500 K, corresponding to a shift from the dissociation-dominated regime to that of ionization. It occurs because dissociation of nitrogen starts almost simultaneously with its ionization, which is not the case of H2, for which dissociation is terminated long before ionization starts. If the charge transfer reaction, whose activation energy is low for both gases, is neglected, in both cases the electron density increases drastically below 9000 K. These results are quite similar to those obtained when calculating the composition with the multitemperature mass action law. The kinetic calculations are dominated by the reactions with a low activation energy: dissociation, dissociative recombination and charge transfer. Thus, a modified pseudoequilibrium calculation has been introduced, the plasma composition being calculated with the equilibrium constants corresponding to low activation energies [X2→2X, e+X+2→2X, X+2 + X→X+ + X2 both for hydrogen (X = H) and nitrogen (X = N)] at the temperature T* between Te and Th. The results are in very good agreement with those of the kinetic calculations.},

	abstract = {Nitride perovskites have only been experimentally realized in very few cases despite the widespread existence and commercial importance of perovskite materials. From oxide perovskites used in ultrasonics to halide perovskites that have revolutionized the photovoltaics industry, the discovery of new perovskite materials has historically impacted a wide number of fields. Here, we add two new perovskites, CeWN3 and CeMoN3, to the list of experimentally realized perovskite nitrides using highthroughput computational screening and subsequent highthroughput thin film growth techniques. Candidate compositions are first down-selected using a tolerance factor and then thermochemical stability. A novel competing fluorite-family phase is identified for both material systems, which we hypothesize is a transient intermediate phase that crystallizes during the evolution from an amorphous material to a stable perovskite. Different processing routes to overcome the competing fluorite phase and obtain phase-pure nitride perovskites are demonstrated for the CeMoN3−x and CeWN3−x material systems, which provide a starting point for the development of future nitride perovskites. Additionally, we find that these new perovskite phases have interesting low-temperature magnetic behavior: CeMoN3−x orders antiferromagnetically below TN ≈ 8 K with indications of strong magnetic frustration, while CeWN3−x exhibits no long-range order down to T = 2 K but has strong antiferromagnetic correlations. This work demonstrates the importance and effectiveness of using high-throughput techniques, both computational and experimental: they are integral to optimize the process of realizing two entirely novel nitride perovskites.},

	abstract = {Ternary iron nitrides are of considerable interest due to their diverse magnetic properties. We find, based on first principles calculations, that the relatively minor structural distortion from the cubic antiperovskite structure in Fe\$\_3\$GeN leads to unusual magnetic behavior. In particular, there is a separation into Fe sites with very different magnetic behaviors, specifically a site with Fe atoms having a stable local moment and a site where the Fe shows characteristics of much more itinerant behavior. This shows a remarkable flexibility of the Fe magnetic behavior in these nitrides and points towards the possibility of systems where minor structural and chemical changes can lead to dramatic changes in magnetic properties. The results suggest that, analogously to oxide perovskite materials, modulation of magnetic properties via chemical or strain control of octahedral rotation may be feasible. This may then lead to approaches for tuning magnetism to realize properties of interest, for example tuning magnetic transitions to quantum critical regimes or to proximity to metamagnetic transitions of interest for devices.},

Combined HT-XRD and TG-DSC measurements evidence that the germanium-richest nitrides are highly expanding materials.

Magnetic measurements reveal that the gradual germanium incorporation is accompanied by a drastic weakening of the ferromagnetic interactions leading to a frustrated iron spin system. Ge

	abstract = {Nitride perovskites have only been experimentally realized in very few cases despite the widespread existence and commercial importance of perovskite materials. From oxide perovskites used in ultrasonics to halide perovskites that have revolutionized the photovoltaics industry, the discovery of new perovskite materials has historically impacted a wide number of fields. Here, we add two new perovskites, CeWN3 and CeMoN3, to the list of experimentally realized perovskite nitrides using highthroughput computational screening and subsequent highthroughput thin film growth techniques. Candidate compositions are first down-selected using a tolerance factor and then thermochemical stability. A novel competing fluorite-family phase is identified for both material systems, which we hypothesize is a transient intermediate phase that crystallizes during the evolution from an amorphous material to a stable perovskite. Different processing routes to overcome the competing fluorite phase and obtain phase-pure nitride perovskites are demonstrated for the CeMoN3−x and CeWN3−x material systems, which provide a starting point for the development of future nitride perovskites. Additionally, we find that these new perovskite phases have interesting low-temperature magnetic behavior: CeMoN3−x orders antiferromagnetically below TN ≈ 8 K with indications of strong magnetic frustration, while CeWN3−x exhibits no long-range order down to T = 2 K but has strong antiferromagnetic correlations. This work demonstrates the importance and effectiveness of using high-throughput techniques, both computational and experimental: they are integral to optimize the process of realizing two entirely novel nitride perovskites.},

	abstract = {Sn(II)-based perovskite oxides, being the subject of longstanding theoretical interest for the past two decades, have been synthesized for the first time with a nanoshell approach. All past reported synthetic attempts had been rendered impotent by the extremely high metastabilities, i.e., thermodynamic instability. Herein, a soft topotactic exchange of Sn(II) cations into Ba-containing perovskites is demonstrated to successfully yield {\textasciitilde}20 nm thick shells of Sn(II) perovskites, i.e. SnHfO3. Additionally, highly pure SnHfO3 was obtained for the first time as nano-eggshell morphologies that circumvent the intrinsic ion-diffusion limits occurring at a low reaction temperature of 200 oC. In summary, the high metastability of the Sn(II) perovskites is shown to be overcome by leveraging the high cohesive energies of the reactants, the exothermic formation of a stable salt side product, and a shortened diffusion pathway for the Sn(II) cations. The new approach finally provides an effective solution to surmounting highly intractable synthetic barriers, and which can be the key to unlocking the door to many other new metastable oxides.},

	abstract = {While Sn(II)-containing perovskite oxides have long drawn attention as Pb(II) substitutes in technologicallyrelevant dielectric materials, they are also highly thermodynamically unstable and potentially impossible to prepare. Investigations into the new ﬂux-mediated syntheses of metastable Sn(II)-containing hafnate and stannate perovskites were aimed at understanding the key factors related to their synthesizability. The BaHfO3 perovskite was reacted with SnClF from 250 to 350  C for 12–72 h, yielding an unprecedented Sn(II) concentration on the Asite of up to {\textasciitilde}70 mol\%, i.e., (Ba0.3Sn0.7)HfO3 in high purity. Elemental mapping using EDS shows the Sn(II) cations diffuse gradually throughout the crystallites, with two reaction cycles needed to give a nearly homogeneous distribution. In contrast, similar reactions with BaSnO3 and as little as 10 mol\% Sn(II) result in decomposition to SnO, SnO2, and BaSnO3. The (Ba1-xSnx)HfO3 compositions exhibit a primary cubic perovskite structure (Pm3m; for x ¼ 1/3, 1/2 and 2/3) by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) methods, with the Sn(II) cations substituted on the A-site. Total energy calculations show the thermodynamic instability versus the ground state (i.e., metastability) for (Ba1-xSnx)HfO3 increases with Sn(II) substitution, reaching a maximum of {\textasciitilde}446 meV atomÀ1 at {\textasciitilde}70 mol\% Sn(II). The decomposition pathway of (Ba1/3Sn2/3)HfO3 was probed by ex situ XRD as well as in situ electron microscopy methods. An onset of thermally-induced decomposition begins at {\textasciitilde}350–400  C to give the more stable oxides which are found to segregate out in surface layers. These results help to elucidate the factors underpinning the synthesizability of highly metastable Sn(II)-containing perovskites, which increases with their cohesive energy and with the absence of lower-energy polymorphs or other ground states that can be reached without signiﬁcant ion diffusion.},

	abstract = {A synthetic route has been discovered to thermodynamically unstable, i.e., metastable, Sn(II)−perovskite oxides that have been highly sought after as lead-free dielectrics and small bandgap semiconductors. A highly facile exchange of Sn(II) is found by using a low melting SnCl2/SnF2 peritectic ﬂux, yielding mixed A-site (Ba1−xSnx)ZrO3 and mixed A- and B-site (Ba1−xSnx)(Zr1−yTiy)O3 solid solutions that exhibit a very high metastability, with up to 60\% Sn(II) cations and a calculated reaction energy for decomposition of up to −0.3 eV atom−1. Kinetic stabilization of the higher Sn(II) concentrations is achieved by the high cohesive energy of the perovskite compositions containing Zr(IV) and mixed Zr(IV)/Ti(IV) cations. Signiﬁcantly red-shifted bandgaps are found with increasing Sn(II) substitution, enabling the optical absorption edge to be broadly tuned from ∼3.90 to ∼1.95 eV. Percolation pathways are calculated to occur for BSZT compositions with {\textgreater}12.5\% Sn(II) and {\textgreater}25\% Ti(IV) cations. High photocatalytic rates are found for molecular oxygen production for compositions which exceed the percolation thresholds, wherein extended diﬀusion pathways should “open up” across the structure and the charge carriers become delocalized rather than trapped. These results establish the critical importance of synthetically accessing metastable semiconductors for the discovery of advanced optical and photocatalytic properties.},

However, the possibility of practical applications is hindered by their low Curie temperature. Currently, whether semiconducting ferromagnetism can exist at room temperature is still unclear because of the absence of a solid physical mechanism. Here, on the basis of tight-binding model analysis and ﬁrst-principles calculations, we report that ferromagnetism in a tetrahedral semiconductor originating from superexchange interactions can be strong enough to survive at room temperature because of the weakening of antiferromagnetic direct-exchange interactions. On the basis of the explored mechanism, a zinc-blende binary transition metal compound, chromium carbide, is predicted to be an intrinsic ferromagnetic tetrahedral semiconductor with a Curie temperature that is as high as ∼1900 K. These ﬁndings not only expand the understandings of magnetism in semiconductors but also are of great interest for room-temperature spintronic applications.},

The R and R w were 0.072 and 0.028, respectively, using w = 1/a,{\textasciitilde} (for 136 reflections with measurable intensity). The structure is a 2 × 2 × 2 NaCI superstructure with partial or short-range ordering of Li and V atoms occupying the octahedral interstices formed by the close-packed O atoms. The O array is distorted slightly, 0.02 A from an F-lattice complex. If layers perpendicular to a [111] direction are represented by the dominant atoms with their relative positions labelled by A, B, and C as subscripts, the stacking sequence is OAM{\textasciitilde}OsmBOcMcOAmAOBMBOcmo where M and m are two types of metal-atom layers.},

	abstract = {LiVO2 undergoes an imperfectly understood orbital ordering transition near 500 K resulting in a loss of magnetic moment below the transition. Studies of the transition have been hampered by a lack of high-quality stoichiometric single crystals. Here we report the growth and basic characterization of large, nearly stoichiometric LiVO2 single crystals. The crystals were characterized by magnetic susceptibility, electrical resistivity, differential scanning calorimetry, and speciﬁc heat measurements over a temperature range from 2 to 650 K. A ﬁrst-order phase transition with large hysteresis near Tt \% 500 K was observed in all measurements. An anisotropy of the order of 100 was observed in the in-plane versus out-of-plane resistivity, and the inferred semiconducting energy gap was 0.18 eV for T {\textless} Tt and 0.14 eV for T {\textless} Tt. Electron diffraction experiments were performed on LiVO2 single crystals at temperatures below and above Tt. Superlattice reﬂections were observed below Tt and disappeared upon heating above the phase transition temperature. Upon cooling below Tt, the supperlattice spots reappeared. Bright ﬁeld electron micrographs indicate that the crystals develop a roughly hexagonal network of cracks.},

The latent heat of the PCM reached a maximum of 300 J/cm3 at the shortest distance where the V3 trimer was stable.

	abstract = {Interfacial magnetism stimulates the discovery of giant magnetoresistance and spin-orbital coupling across the heterointerfaces, facilitating the intimate correlation between spin transport and complex magnetic structures. Over decades, functional heterointerfaces composed of nitrides are seldomly explored due to the difficulty in synthesizing high-quality and correct composition nitride films. Here we report the fabrication of single-crystalline ferromagnetic Fe3N thin films with precisely controlled thickness. As film thickness decreasing, the magnetization deteriorates dramatically, and electronic state transits from metallic to insulating. Strikingly, the high-temperature ferromagnetism maintains in a Fe3N layer with a thickness down to 2 u. c. ({\textasciitilde} 8 \{{\textbackslash}AA\}). The magnetoresistance exhibits a strong in-plane anisotropy and meanwhile the anomalous Hall resistance reserves its sign when Fe3N layer thickness exceeds 5 u. c. Furthermore, we observe a sizable exchange bias at the interfaces between a ferromagnetic Fe3N and an antiferromagnetic CrN. The exchange bias field and saturation moment strongly depend on the controllable bending curvature using cylinder diameter engineering (CDE) technique, implying the tunable magnetic states under lattice deformation. This work provides a guideline for exploring functional nitride films and applying their interfacial phenomena for innovative perspectives towards the practical applications.},

The data show clear evidence for the magnetically-induced distortion of the V sublattice to form trimers, the distortion persisting at even the highest excess Li content considered of x = 0.1. At least three distinct local environments were observed for the stoichiometric material LiVO2 in 6Li nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, the environments becoming progressively more disordered as the Li content increases. A two-dimensional Li−Li correlation NMR experiment (POST-C7) was used to identify the resonances corresponding to Li within the same layers. NMR spectra were acquired as a function of the state of charge, a distinct environment for Li in Li2VO2 being observed. The results suggest that disorder within the Li layers (in addition to the presence of Li within the V layers as proposed by Armstrong et al. Nat. Mater. 2011, 10, 223−229) may aid the insertion of Li into the Li1+xV1−xO2 phase. The previously little-studied Li2VO2 phase was also investigated by hybrid density functional theory (DFT) calculations, providing insights into magnetic interactions, spin−lattice coupling, and Li hyperﬁne parameters.},

The bulks were synthesized using a solid-state reaction between AENH and TMN precursors with NaN3 to achieve high N chemical potential during the reaction. The AETMN2 bulks are n-type semiconductors with optical band gaps of 1.63 eV for SrTiN2, 1.97 eV for BaZrN2, and 2.17 eV for BaHfN2. SrTiN2 and BaZrN2 bulks show degenerated electron conduction due to the natural high-density electron doping and paramagnetic behavior in all of the temperature ranges examined, while such unintentional carrier generation is largely suppressed in BaHfN2, which exhibits nondegenerated electron conduction. The BaHfN2 sample also exhibits weak ferromagnetic behavior at temperatures lower than 35 K. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the high-density electron carriers in SrTiN2 come from oxygen impurity substitution at the N site (ON) acting as a shallow donor even if the high-N chemical potential synthesis conditions are employed. On the other hand, the formation energy of ON becomes larger in BaHfN2 because of the stronger TM−N chemical bonds. Present results demonstrate that the easiness of impurity incorporation is designed by density functional calculations to produce a more intrinsic semiconductor in wider chemical conditions, opening a way to cultivating novel functional materials that are sensitive to atmospheric impurities and defects.},

	abstract = {Understanding the structure and behavior of intermediates in chemical reactions is the key to developing greater control over the reaction outcome. This principle is particularly important in the synthesis of metal nanocrystals (NCs), where the reduction, nucleation, and growth of the reaction intermediates will determine the ﬁnal size and shape of the product. The shape of metal NCs plays a major role in determining their catalytic, photochemical, and electronic properties and, thus, the potential applications of the material. In this work, we demonstrate that layered coordination polymers, called lamellae, are reaction intermediates in Cu NC synthesis. Importantly, we discover that the lamella structure can be ﬁne-tuned using organic ligands of diﬀerent lengths and that these structural changes control the shape of the ﬁnal NC. Speciﬁcally, we show that short-chain phosphonate ligands generate lamellae that are stable enough at the reaction temperature to facilitate the growth of Cu nuclei into anisotropic Cu NCs, being primarily triangular plates. In contrast, lamellae formed from long-chain ligands lose their structure and form spherical Cu NCs. The synthetic approach presented here provides a versatile tool for the future development of metal NCs, including other anisotropic structures.},

However, nucleation is a complex process with reaction pathways which are often not covered by the CNT. Herein, we study the formation mechanism of copper nanospheres using in situ X-ray absorption and scattering measurements. We reveal that their nucleation involves coordination polymer lamellae as pre-nucleation structures occupying a local minimum in the reaction energy landscape. Having learned this, we achieved a superior monodispersity for Cu nanospheres of different sizes. This report exemplifies the importance of developing a more realistic picture of the mechanism involved in the formation of inorganic nanoparticles to develop a rational approach to their synthesis.},

Variable-temperature neutron diffraction demonstrates that LiNiN forms a variant of the parent Li3N structure in which Li+ ion vacancies are ordered within the [LiN] planes and with Ni exclusively occupying interlayer positions (at 280 K: hexagonal space group P6hm2, a ) 3.74304(5) Å, c ) 3.52542(6) Å, Z ) 1).

Rietveld reﬁnements against the powder diffraction data conﬁrm that this compound is cubic, space group Pm3m, with nitrogen atoms located at the corners of the unit cell and the copper atoms occupying the centres of the unit cell edges. The neutron diffraction data conﬁrmed that both nitrogen and copper sites are fully occupied and showed no evidence for nitrogen nonstoichiometry or the presence of interstitial copper atoms at the centre of the unit cell. The SEM study reveals that the Cu3N powders are composed of plate-shaped particles of sub-micron size. The overall results indicate that the synthetic procedure reported here can be used to prepare reproducibly large amounts of stoichiometric Cu3N powders of high purity.},

Structural models obtained from Rietveld reﬁnements against the powder neutron diffraction data indicate that the Zn3N2 powders so-prepared have the anti-bixbyite structure and are almost certainly stoichiometric with no compelling evidence of nitrogen vacancies. Further, no evidence was found for aliovalent oxygen substitution at the nitrogen sites. The calculated bond valence sums imply that Zn3N2 cannot be described as a 100\% ionic compound. The structural ﬁndings are supported by photoluminescence measurements that reveal a band gap of approximately 0.9 eV.},

The products were structurally characterised by powder X-ray diffraction (PXD), while scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) were used to examine morphology and composition. The resulting carbonitrides crystallise with the rock salt structure and the cubic lattice parameters vary linearly with increasing titanium concentration (x), hence following Vegard’s law.

Each of the nitride carbodiimides are composed of Ca–N three dimensional networks built from edge- and vertexsharing NCa6 octahedra arranged to create one-dimensional channels. The size of the channels is dependent on the Ca:C (host:guest) ratio and the larger channels in (1) are occupied by twice as many guest species as those in (2). Importantly, neutron diffraction data conﬁrm that the identity of these guest species is carbodiimide (as opposed to isoelectronic azide), that neither the framework nor the channels therefore contain excess electrons and that the compounds are hence not ‘‘nitride electrides’’ as per the parent subnitride, Ca2N.},

	abstract = {Muon spin relaxation and powder neutron diffraction have been combined to study three lithium cobalt nitride battery materials. Neutron diffraction shows that these retain the P6/mmm space group of Li3N with Co located only on Li(1) sites. The lattice parameters vary smoothly with the degree of metal substitution, such that the [Li2N] layers expand while the layer separation contracts, as observed previously for similar series of Cu- and Ni-substituted materials. However, in contrast to the latter, the Li3-x-yCoxN phases exhibit Curie-Weiss paramagnetism and this prevents the use of nuclear magnetic resonance to measure Li+ transport parameters. Therefore, muon spin relaxation has been employed here as an alternative technique to obtain quantitative information about Li+ diffusion. Muon spin relaxation shows that Li+ diffusion in Li3-xyCoxN is anisotropic with transport confined to the [Li2N] plane at low temperature and exchange between Li(1) and Li(2) sites dominant at high temperature. By a comparison with previous studies some general trends have been established across a range of Cu-, Ni- and Co-substituted materials. For intra-layer diffusion Ea decreases as metal substitution increases and the corresponding expansion of the layers results in a more open pathway for Li+ diffusion. However, an optimal value of x is found with a ≈ 3.69 Å after which the concomitant contraction in layer spacing reduces the polarizability of the lattice framework.},

	abstract = {The 14N/15N isotopic exchange pathways over Co3Mo3N, a material of interest as an ammonia synthesis catalyst and for the development of nitrogen transfer reactions, have been investigated. Both the homomolecular and heterolytic exchange processes have been studied, and it has been shown that lattice nitrogen species are exchangeable. The exchange behavior was found to be a strong function of pretreatment with ca. 25\% of lattice N atoms being exchanged after 40 min at 600 °C after N2 pretreatment at 700 °C compared to only 6\% following similar Ar pretreatment. This observation, for which the potential contribution of adsorbed N species can be discounted, is signiﬁcant in terms of the application of this material. In the case of the Co6Mo6N phase, regeneration to Co3Mo3N under 15N2 at 600 °C occurs concurrently with 14N15N formation. These observations demonstrate the reactivity of nitrogen in the Co−Mo−N system to be a strong function of pretreatment and worthy of further consideration.},

The structure of the microwave-synthesised powders was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction [tetragonal space group I41/a; a = 4.8864(1) Å, c = 9.9183(2) Å] and the nitride hydride reacts with moist air under ambient conditions to produce lithium hydroxide and subsequently lithium carbonate. Li4NH undergoes no dehydrogenation or decomposition [under Ar(g)] below 773 K. A tetragonal–cubic phase transition, however, occurs for the compound at ca. 770 K. The new high temperature (HT) phase adopts an anti-fluorite structure (space group Fm 3 m; a = 4.9462(3) Å) with N3− and H− ions disordered on the 4a sites. Thermal treatment of Li4NH under nitrogen yields a stoichiometric mixture of lithium nitride and lithium imide (Li3N and Li2NH respectively).},

	abstract = {Solid state ternary and quaternary metal nitrides containing a transition metal and one or two very electropositive metals such as alkali and (or) alkaline earth metals exhibit a number of structures containing low-coordinate transition metals in the transition metal - nitrogen subnetwork. Transition metal - nitrogen double and even triple bonds are found in these structures involving d{\textasciitilde} +PT bonding from a filled transition metal d orbital to an otherwise empty nitrogenp orbital. Such multiply bonded nitrogen atoms function as strong field ligands in contrast to amido ligands such as (Me,Si),N-, which generally function as weak field ligands in transition metal chemistry. The transition metal environment in these ternary nitrides can be modelled by "banana bonds" from the polyhedron using the atomic orbitals required for both the a- and T-bonding to the nitride ligands, e.g., the trigonal prism for the trigonal planar derivatives M"'N,\& (M = V, Cr, Mn, Fe) with three M=N double bonds as well as F{\textasciitilde}"N,\&in L{\textasciitilde},F{\textasciitilde}"Nw, ith two F s N triple bonds and the planar square for the discrete linear COIN;- in LiSr,CoN,.

	abstract = {Development of high conductivity solid-state electrolytes for lithium ion batteries has proceeded rapidly in recent years, but incorporating these new materials into highperforming batteries has proven diﬃcult. Interfacial resistance is now the limiting factor in many systems, but the exact mechanisms of this resistance have not been fully explained in part because experimental evaluation of the interface can be very diﬃcult. In this work, we develop a computational methodology to examine the thermodynamics of formation of resistive interfacial phases. The predicted interfacial phase formation is well correlated with experimental interfacial observations and battery performance. We calculate that thiophosphate electrolytes have especially high reactivity with high voltage cathodes and a narrow electrochemical stability window. We also ﬁnd that a number of known electrolytes are not inherently stable but react in situ with the electrode to form passivating but ionically conducting barrier layers. As a reference for experimentalists, we tabulate the stability and expected decomposition products for a wide range of electrolyte, coating, and electrode materials including a number of high-performing combinations that have not yet been attempted experimentally.},

We demonstrate the application of this approach in reaction planning for the solid-state synthesis of a range of compounds, including the widely studied oxides LiCoO2, BaTiO3, and YBa2Cu3O7, as well as other metal oxide, oxyﬂuoride, phosphate, and nitride targets.

Here highest-resolution tools reveal the existence of a previously hidden FeNi nanophase within the extremely slowly cooled metallic meteorite NWA 6259. This new nanophase exists alongside Ni-poor and Ni-rich nanoprecipitates within a matrix of tetrataenite, the uniaxial, chemically ordered form of FeNi. The ferromagnetic nature of the nanoprecipitates combined with the antiferromagnetic character of the FeNi nanophases gives rise to a complex magnetic state that evolves dramatically with temperature. These observations extend and possibly alter our understanding of celestial metallurgy, provide new knowledge concerning the archetypal Fe−Ni phase diagram and supply new information for the development of new types of sustainable, technologically critical high-energy magnets.},

	abstract = {Magnetic nitrides, if manufactured in bulk form, would provide designers of transformers and inductors with a new class of better performing and affordable soft magnetic materials. According to experimental results from thin films and/or theoretical calculations, magnetic nitrides would have magnetic moments well in excess of current state of the art soft magnets. Furthermore, magnetic nitrides would have higher resistivities than current transformer core materials and therefore not require the use of laminates of inactive material to limit eddy current losses. However, almost all of the magnetic nitrides have been elusive except in difficult to reproduce thin films or as inclusions in another material. Now, through its ability to reduce atmospheric nitrogen, the electrochemical solution growth (ESG) technique can bring highly sought after (and previously inaccessible) new magnetic nitrides into existence in bulk form. This method utilizes a molten salt as a solvent to solubilize metal cations and nitrogen ions produced electrochemically and form nitrogen compounds. Unlike other growth methods, the scalable ESG process can sustain high growth rates ({\textasciitilde}mm/hr) even under reasonable operating conditions (atmospheric pressure and 500 °C). Ultimately, this translates into a high throughput, low cost, manufacturing process. The ESG process has already been used successfully to grow high quality GaN. Below, the experimental results of an exploratory express LDRD project to access the viability of the ESG technique to grow magnetic nitrides will be presented.},

	abstract = {L10-orderd FeNi alloy ﬁlms with a high degree of order (S) and a large uniaxial magnetic anisotropy energy (Ku) were realized by denitriding FeNiN ﬁlms. FeNiN ﬁlms with the a-axis perpendicular to the ﬁlm plane were epitaxially grown on SrTiO3 (001) substrates by molecular beam epitaxy by changing the growth temperatures (TS) to 200, 250, and 350  C. The a-axis oriented epitaxial L10-FeNi ﬁlms were fabricated by annealing the FeNiN ﬁlms in a H2 gas atmosphere at 300  C. S and Ku of the denitrided L10-FeNi ﬁlms were characterized by anomalous x-ray diffraction using synchrotron radiation and magnetic torque measurements, respectively. A high S of 0.87 and a Ku of 5.9 Â 105 J/m3 were realized in the L10-FeNi ﬁlm with a TS of 350  C. This high S value exceeds the values reported on L10-FeNi to date, but the Ku value was comparable to those of c-axis oriented L10-FeNi ﬁlms with S \$ 0.5 grown by alternate monoatomic deposition of Fe and Ni layers. A possible origin for the suppressed macroscopic Ku in a-axis oriented L10-FeNi ﬁlms is discussed, and denitriding FeNiN is a promising method for the fabrication of L10-FeNi with a high S and a large Ku.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: FeNiN has recently been recognized as an appropriate intermediate compound for synthesizing FeNi alloys with an L10-type crystal structure, via nitrogen insertion and a topotactic extraction technique. These alloys are promising candidates for rare-earth-free permanent magnets. Although it is important to understand the physical properties of FeNiN to synthesize high-performance L10-FeNi, knowledge in this regard is lacking; it is only known that the crystal structure is tetragonal. In this study, the physical properties of high-quality FeNiN are investigated with respect to both structure and magnetism. FeNiN nanoparticles are obtained via an ammonia nitriding process at 300 °C for 50 h using A1-FeNi nanoparticles as precursors. Neutron powder diﬀraction (NPD) analysis indicates that the magnetic structure is C-type antiferromagnetic with ferromagnetically coupled Fe chains along the c axis, while Ni is nonmagnetic. Mössbauer spectroscopy measurements for both 57Fe and 61Ni are consistent with the conclusions of NPD analysis. The χ−T curve of FeNiN temperature (or shows Weiss a cusp associated with the temperature) is positive at aθnpti≈fer1ro0m0 aKg,naestidceptehramseinteradnbsiytiothneaχt−T1−N T≈ 178 plot. K, and the asymptotic Curie Both the magnetic structure and magnetic moment of Fe estimated by ﬁrst-principles calculations are in accordance with the experimentally obtained ones, and the estimated transition temperature is close to the experimentally determined value. The calculation results concerning the exchange coupling between various Fe sites qualitatively explain the observed positive θp and antiferromagnetic long-range order.},

On the other hand, having fast, complete nitride dissolution and ammonia formation in acid can offer new opportunities for distributed, on-demand ammonia generation. Optimizing nitride chemistries for these clean energy applications requires design principles for nitride dissolution and ammonia formation in acid. Here, we report that lowering the nitrogen 2p band center of transition metal nitrides relative to the Fermi level weakens metal–nitrogen bonds and increases labile metallic character, reducing dissolution reaction barriers and boosting ammonia formation kinetics in acid. Increasing the solubility of dissolved metal cations further facilitates the decomposition of nitrides in acid by prohibiting surface oxide passivation. These ﬁndings highlight essential future directions for preventing nitride dissolution or facilitating ammonia production for diverse acidic applications.},

Here, we demonstrate an atomic layer deposition (ALD) process with a double nitrogen plasma process that successfully produces nitrogenincorporated magnesium phosphorus oxynitride (MgPON) solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) thin films at a low deposition temperature of 125 oC. The ALD MgPON SSEs exhibit an ionic conductivity of 0.36 and 1.2 μS cm-1 at 450 and 500 °C, respectively. The proposed ALD strategy shows the ability of conformal deposition nitrogen-doped SSEs on pattered substrates and is attractive for using nitride ionconducing films as protective or wetting interlayers in solid-state Mg and Li batteries.},

	abstract = {Countless inorganic materials are prepared via high temperature solid-state reaction of mixtures of reagents powders. Understanding and controlling the phenomena that limit these solid-state reactions is crucial to designing reactions for new materials synthesis. Here, focusing on topotactic ion-exchange between NaFeO2 and LiBr as a model reaction, we manipulate the mesoscale reaction architecture and transport pathways by changing the packing and interfacial contact between reagent particles. Through analysis of in situ synchrotron X-ray diﬀraction data, we identify multiple kinetic regimes that reﬂect transport limitations on diﬀerent length scales: a fast kinetic regime in the ﬁrst minutes of the reaction and a slow kinetic regime that follows. The fast kinetic regime dominates the observed reaction progress and depends on the reagent packing; this challenges the view that solid-state reactions are necessarily slow. Using a phase-ﬁeld model, we simulated the reaction process and showed that particles without direct contact to the other reactant phases experience large reduction in the reaction rate, even when transport hindrance at particle−particle contacts is not considered.},

For films containing 75\% antimony and 25\% iron, the metastable compound FeSb(3) was observed to nucleate and grow if the layer thickness was below approximately 35 A. Above this critical thickness for the modulation, annealing led to the formation of FeSb(2). This, combined with low-angle diffraction data, suggests that the initial interdiffusion between iron and antimony layers in an elementally modulated reactant results in the formation of an amorphous reaction intermediate if the layering thickness is less than 35 A. For modulated reactants with composition between 70 and 90 atomic \% antimony and below this critical layer thickness, the metastable compound FeSb(3) formed. In more iron-rich modulated reactants FeSb(2) nucleates. The nucleation temperature and the nucleation energy of FeSb(3) were found to be a function of the composition of the amorphous intermediate, while those of FeSb(2) were found to be relatively independent of composition.},

The nucleation energy of the ternary compound La(0.5)Fe(4)Sb(12) with the skutterudite crystal structure was found to depend very strongly on the Fe/Sb ratio in the modulated elemental reactant, with a higher nucleation energy as the Fe/Sb ratio is moved away from the 1:3 stoichiometric value. When the results of this study are compared with those from Fe(y)Sb(z) modulated reactants, the addition of lanthanum was found to suppress the nucleation of FeSb(2), thereby broadening the Fe/Sb composition range in which the ternary skutterudite compound La(x)Fe(4)Sb(12) nucleates. This suppression of nucleation of a binary phase on addition of a ternary component to an amorphous intermediate is in agreement with theoretical arguments.

Specifically, the members of this series containing 1/1, 2/2, 3/3, 4/4, 6/6, 8/8, 9/9, 12/12, and 15/15 TiSe2/NbSe2 units as the unit cell of the superlattice were prepared as polycrystalline thin films oriented with the dichalcogenide layers perpendicular to the substrate surface.

Theta-theta scans show a gradual decrease of the (00l) diffraction line widths of the growing compound as a function of annealing time and temperature indicating an increase in the c-axis domain size. High-angle rocking curve diffraction data show increasing c-axis orientation, suggesting TiSe2/NbSe2 crystal growth perpendicular to the substrate surface upon low-temperature annealing. The end products of this synthetic approach are high quality c-axis-oriented TiSe2/NbSe2 crystalline superlattices with designed structure resulting from relatively low-temperature annealing at 500 °C.

              Accelerated inorganic synthesis remains a significant challenge in the search for novel, functional materials. Many of the principles which enable “synthesis by design” in synthetic organic chemistry do not exist in solid-state chemistry, despite the availability of extensive computed/experimental thermochemistry data. In this work, we present a chemical reaction network model for solid-state synthesis constructed from available thermochemistry data and devise a computationally tractable approach for suggesting likely reaction pathways via the application of pathfinding algorithms and linear combination of lowest-cost paths in the network.

Since all the aforementioned members but the R = Sc member were converted to an orthorhombic perovskite phase under the 5-GPa high-pressure condition, an additional sample of InMnO3 of the hexagonal structure was prepared and tested for the high-pressure conversion. The stability limit of the orthorhombic perovskite structure under the 5-GPa high-pressure condition was concluded to be located between InMnO3 and LuMnO3 in terms of the size of the A-site cation constituent, RIII or InIII. The decrease in the size of RIII was found to increase the distortion of o-RMnO3 with a decrease in the Mn\{single bond\}O\{single bond\}Mn bond angle from 144.3° for Dy to 140.3° for Lu.

The metal-insulator transition temperature in AMnO3 perovskites and the critical tem- perature in A2CuO4 superconductors are both found to decrease linearly with this size variance at constant doping level and average A cation radius. This result enables a pair of quadratic relationships for the mean size and size variance effects to be proposed as the result of changing strain energies associated with small structural distortions at the electronic transitions. Doping level, mean A cation radius, and the size variance are thus the three major parameters that control electronic properties in oxygen stoichiometric perovskite oxides. Contents},

In this work, Raman spectroscopy, coupled with the density functional theory (DFT) method, has been used to solve the CsB3O5 (CBO) melt structure. When the CBO crystal melts, the extra-ring B-4-empty set bonds (the B-empty set bonds of Bempty set4 groups, empty set = bridging oxygen atom) that connect two B(3)O(3)empty set(4) rings (the basic boron-oxygen unit in the CBO crystal structure) break. As a result, the three-dimensional boron-oxygen network collapses to unique polymer-like [B(3)O(4)empty set(2)](n) chains. On the basis of the optimized [B(3)O(4)empty set(2)](n) chain model, the CBO melt Raman spectrum was calculated by the DFT method for the first time and the calculated results confirm that the [B(3)O(4)empty set(2)](n) chain is the primary species in the CBO melt. These results also demonstrate the capability of the combined Raman spectral and DFT method for analyzing borate melt structures.},

HoMnO3is metamagnetic below 9 K. In YbMnO3and HoMnO3, both the rare-earth and Mn ions carry approximately their full moment.

	abstract = {The results of oxygen nonstoichiometry, δ, as well as chemical expansion as functions of oxygen partial pressure pO2 and temperature are presented for the perovskite-type undoped manganite LaMnO3 ± δ. The modeling of the defect structure of this perovskite is carried out in both deficit and excess oxygen regions. Within the framework of the model electrons and electron holes are assumed to be localized on manganese sites in LaMnO3 ± δ. Defect structure models proposed are shown to fit perfectly well the experimental data on oxygen nonstoichiometry of LaMnO3 ± δ. Equilibrium constants of the appropriate defect reactions are, therefore, determined. As a consequence, concentrations of all defect species defined within the frameworks of the model proposed are calculated as functions of temperature and oxygen nonstoichiometry. These dependences are employed in the chemical expansion model derived by us earlier and based on the relative change of the mean ionic radius in order to compute the LaMnO3 - δ chemical expansion versus oxygen nonstoichiometry. The experimental data on the chemical expansion of LaMnO3 - δ and those calculated on the basis of the model proposed are shown to coincide with each other very good. Such coincidence implies obviously that the isothermal expansion of LaMnO3 - δ observed with small deviation from its stoichiometric composition with respect to oxygen at given temperature is solely caused by the mean ionic radius increase. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Aside from its fundamental importance, the mutual control of electric and magnetic properties is of significant interest for applications in magnetic storage media and 'spintronics'. The coupled electric and magnetic ordering in ferroelectromagnets is accompanied by the formation of domains and domain walls. However, such a cross-correlation between magnetic and electric domains has so far not been observed. Here we report spatial maps of coupled antiferromagnetic and ferroelectric domains in YMnO3, obtained by imaging with optical second harmonic generation. The coupling originates from an interaction between magnetic and electric domain walls, which leads to a configuration that is dominated by the ferroelectromagnetic product of the order parameters.},

When the radius of the rare-earth ion R is smaller than that of Dy, for instance in YMnO(3), the orthorhombic phase becomes metastable at ambient pressure, which impedes the crystal growth; thus, the detailed magnetic and multiferroic properties of the metastable phase have not been characterized. In this work, we successfully obtained single crystals of orthorhombic YMnO(3) using quasi-hydrothermal conditions under a high pressure of 5.5 GPa. Magnetic and dielectric measurements under magnetic fields revealed that the magnetic ground state is the commensurate E-type antiferromagnetic, while a cycloidal spin phase likely coexists in the intermediate temperature range, which enhances the magnetoelectric response to external fields.},

Hexagonal α-SrMnO3 − δ and LaMnO3 ± δ perovskite are only partly miscible. Room temperature metastable La1 − xSrxMnO3 ± δ solid solutions, prepared by quenching from high temperatures where there is complete solid solubility between cubic β-SrMnO3 − δ and LaMnO3 ± δ perovskite, have rhombohedral, tetragonal or cubic symmetry dependent on the Sr content. Orthorhombic LaMnO3 + δ and CaMnO3 − δ form a stable La1 − xCaxMnO3 ± δ solid solution in the whole composition region. The unit cell volume of La1 − xSrxMnO3 ± δ and La1 − xCaxMnO3 ± δ solid solutions is reduced with decreasing La-content mainly due to the correlated change in average oxidation state from Mn3+ to Mn4+. The oxygen stoichiometry changes from cation deficient (oxygen excess) at high La-content to oxygen deficiency at low La-content. The enthalpy of the phase transitions of CaMnO3 − δ and the transition from α-SrMnO3 (hexagonal) to β-SrMnO3 − δ (perovskite) were obtained by differential thermal analysis. Finally, the physical appearance of first order phase transition between different perovskite-related structures is analysed in terms of the Gibbs phase rule. First order transitions between different structures of a ternary oxide ABO3 − δ become two-phase regions in a quasi-binary system like ABO3 − δ–A′BO3 − δ.},

The specimen expanded upon reduction at fixed temperatures, and its dependence on temperature and oxygen partial pressure conformed to that of oxygen-deficit nonstoichiometry, which was formulated on the basis of a defect model by Mizusaki et al. [Solid State Ionics 129 (2000) 163]. The measured expansion was in almost linear relationship with the oxygen nonstoichiometry. In consideration of reported behavior that the unit cell shrinks upon Sr-doping and upon formation of cation vacancy, the origin of the expansion upon reduction is regarded as the increase in the size of B-site cation, which accompanies the charge compensation for the formation of oxide ion vacancies. The expansion rate that was estimated from the variation in averaged ionic radius of Mn was higher than the experimentally observed one; it is supposed that the effect of the increase in B-site radius is partly offset by the increase in the crystallographic distortion. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, Raman spectroscopy, coupled with the density functional theory (DFT) method, has been used to solve the CsB3O5 (CBO) melt structure. When the CBO crystal melts, the extra-ring B4–Ø bonds (the B–Ø bonds of BØ4 groups, Ø = bridging oxygen atom) that connect two B3O3Ø4 rings (the basic boron–oxygen unit in the CBO crystal structure) break. As a result, the three-dimensional boron–oxygen network collapses to unique polymer-like [B3O4Ø2]n chains. On the basis of the optimized [B3O4Ø2]n chain model, the CBO melt Raman spectrum was calculated by the DFT method for the first time and the calculated results confirm that the [B3O4Ø2]n chain is the primary species in the CBO melt. These results also demonstrate the capability of the combined Raman spectral and DFT method for analyzing borate melt structures.},

Combining a DFT/MM approach with instantaneous normal-mode analyses (INMA), we compute the IR solution spectra of anionic and neutral flavin radicals. For a set of mid-IR marker bands, we identify those changes of spectral locations, intensities, and widths, which are caused by sequentially adding an electron and a proton to the oxidized flavin. Comparisons with experimental IR solution spectra of flavin radicals show the accuracy of our DFT/MM-INMA approach and allow us to assign the observed bands. The room temperature ensembles of solvent cages required for the INMA calculations of the IR spectra are generated in an MM setting from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. For the solvated flavin radicals, these MD simulations employ MM force fields derived from DFT/MM calculations.},

The kx-component increases from 0.420(4), immediately below the ordering temperature, to 0.435(2) at T = 28.7 K. Below 28 K the kx-component remains unchanged.

              The Gibbs energy,
              G
              , determines the equilibrium conditions of chemical reactions and materials stability. Despite this fundamental and ubiquitous role,
              G
              has been tabulated for only a small fraction of known inorganic compounds, impeding a comprehensive perspective on the effects of temperature and composition on materials stability and synthesizability. Here, we use the SISSO (sure independence screening and sparsifying operator) approach to identify a simple and accurate descriptor to predict
              G
              for stoichiometric inorganic compounds with {\textasciitilde}50 meV atom

              ({\textasciitilde}1 kcal mol
              −1
              ) resolution, and with minimal computational cost, for temperatures ranging from 300–1800 K. We then apply this descriptor to {\textasciitilde}30,000 known materials curated from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD). Using the resulting predicted thermochemical data, we generate thousands of temperature-dependent phase diagrams to provide insights into the effects of temperature and composition on materials synthesizability and stability and to establish the temperature-dependent scale of metastability for inorganic compounds.},

            The space of metastable materials offers promising new design opportunities for next-generation technological materials, such as complex oxides, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, steels, and beyond. Although metastable phases are ubiquitous in both nature and technology, only a heuristic understanding of their underlying thermodynamics exists. We report a large-scale data-mining study of the Materials Project, a high-throughput database of density functional theory–calculated energetics of Inorganic Crystal Structure Database structures, to explicitly quantify the thermodynamic scale of metastability for 29,902 observed inorganic crystalline phases. We reveal the influence of chemistry and composition on the accessible thermodynamic range of crystalline metastability for polymorphic and phase-separating compounds, yielding new physical insights that can guide the design of novel metastable materials. We further assert that not all low-energy metastable compounds can necessarily be synthesized, and propose a principle of ‘remnant metastability’—that observable metastable crystalline phases are generally remnants of thermodynamic conditions where they were once the lowest free-energy phase.},

	abstract = {Significance
            Dense inorganic materials comprise most functional electronic, optical, and magnetic devices. Whereas the discovery of new inorganic materials can increase our technical capabilities and uncover new phenomena, the search is difficult due to their formation at high temperatures where only the most stable (often known) materials can be isolated postreaction. We find a variety of unexpected and unknown materials nucleating at moderate temperatures in molten salts. By probing these processes with in situ diffraction, we are able to identify a large variety of new phases quickly and pave a path to more efficient materials discovery.
          , 
            Rapid shifts in the energy, technological, and environmental demands of materials science call for focused and efficient expansion of the library of functional inorganic compounds. To achieve the requisite efficiency, we need a materials discovery and optimization paradigm that can rapidly reveal all possible compounds for a given reaction and composition space. Here we provide such a paradigm via in situ X-ray diffraction measurements spanning solid, liquid flux, and recrystallization processes. We identify four new ternary sulfides from reactive salt fluxes in a matter of hours, simultaneously revealing routes for ex situ synthesis and crystal growth. Changing the flux chemistry, here accomplished by increasing sulfur content, permits comparison of the allowable crystalline building blocks in each reaction space. The speed and structural information inherent to this method of in situ synthesis provide an experimental complement to computational efforts to predict new compounds and uncover routes to targeted materials by design.},

The atomic hydrogen hypothesis for preferential etching of graphite over diamond is equivalent to the assumption that the chemical potential of carbon in the gas phase is larger than that in diamond and smaller than that in graphite, which is contradictory to the well-established stability of graphite with respect to diamond. The chemical potential of carbon between diamond and graphite is shown to be reversed when the size of the carbon cluster is sufficiently small. The number of atoms in the carbon clusters that make diamond more stable than graphite is estimated to be ∼ 104 at 1200 K and 2700 Pa from the reported values of the surface energy data. This number is much smaller than those for the other systems where the formation of metastable phases is the rule rather than an exception. The role of gas activation is probably to decrease the surface energy ratio of graphite to diamond and thus to increase this number, thus inducing the dominant formation of diamond.},

Modern functional materials; spanning nanomaterials, multiferrorics, materials for energy storage and conversion, colloidal crystals, etc.; are decidedly non-simple, leveraging various additional forms of thermodynamic work to achieve their functionality.

The lattice structure is composed of cornersharing octahedra and contains three-dimensional geometrical frustration in terms of magnetic interactions. The system with the nearest-neighbor interactions alone does not exhibit any phase transition, leading to a degenerate ground state with large residual entropy. The degeneracy is lifted by an external magnetic ﬁeld or by an anisotropy in the interactions. Depending on the anisotropy, they stabilize either a 3D ferrimagnetic state or a partially-disordered antiferromagnetic (PDAF) state with a dimensionality reduction to 2D. By the degeneracy-lifting perturbations, all the transition temperatures of these diﬀerent ordered states continuously grow from zero, leaving an unusual zero-temperature critical point at the unperturbed point. Such a zero-temperature multicriticality is not observed in other frustrated structures such as face-centered cubic and pyrochlore. The transition to the PDAF state is represented by either the ﬁrst- or second-order boundaries separated by tricritical lines, whereas the PDAF phase shows 1/3 magnetization plateaus.},

Under the conditions used in this study, the potential of the Li-Pb electrode is equal to the decomposition voltage of Li3N. The activity of Li3N in molten LiCl was determined for an ionic fractions of N3 ranging from χN3 = 10 4 to 0.028. The nitride ion concentration in the salt was determined by chemical titration. The activity coefficient of the Li3N at high dilution was found to be very low, around 10 4. The activity coefficient increases sharply with composition and has a value of 0.25 at χN3 = 0.028. © 2001 The Electrochemical Society.},

The main phase of obtained nitride layer was found to be an fcc-structured γ′-Fe4N from XRD analysis. From XPS and EPMA results, it was confirmed that the nitride film was composed of a stack of two layers: the top layer was a ϵ-Fe2N1-x layer with a concentration gradient, and the other one was a homogeneous γ′-Fe4N layer.

Chromium nitride films were obtained by means of potentiostatic electrolysis of chromium electrodes in the melts. From XPS and XRD analyses, it was confirmed that all obtained films consisted of Cr2N and CrN, and the composition of each nitride layer was effected by the applied potential value. For instance, a nitride layer consists mostly of Cr2N on a chromium specimen after potentiostatic electrolysis at 1.0 V (vs. Li+/Li), and it consists mostly of CrN at 1.5 V. At the potential range from 1.0-1.5 V, the ratio of CrN-Cr2N in the nitride layer increases, as the applied potential is more positive. Furthermore, the thickness of the nitride layer increases with increasing the electrolysis time. The obtained results suggest that compositions and thickness of nitride films can be controled by electrolytic conditions, e.g. applied potential and electrolysis time. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The diffusion coefficient of nitride ion is estimated to be about 1.8 × 10-5 cm2 s-1 at 723 K.

Thermodynamic stability predictions play a central role in the efﬁcacy of these approaches and should be considered carefully. This review covers the fundamentals of calculating thermodynamic stability using ﬁrst-principles methods. Stability is delineated into two main topics—stability with respect to decomposition into competing phases and stability with respect to phase transition into alternative structures at ﬁxed composition. For each topic, a summary of the state-of-the-art is provided along with a tutorial overview of practical considerations. The application of machine learning to both kinds of stability predictions is also covered. Finally, the limitations of thermodynamic stability predictions are discussed within the context of predicting the synthesizability of materials.},

The conditions under which such transitions will display the same characteristics as encountered in the usual one-to-two phase transitions (condensation, crystallization, boiling) are analyzed by comparison to the classical theory of nucleation. Because of the lack of knowledge about the exact values of the relevant parameters, the discussion is carried out mostly in descriptive thermodynamic terms. Although nucleation effects are analyzed in general terms, the main focus of attention is a class of reactions where nucleation dominates the formation of a new phase; a salient feature of these reactions is the absence of any equilibrium temperature, although the nucleation temperatures are relatively well defined within narrow limits. Nucleation effects are correlated to such material characteristics as the stability of the nucleated phases, and to such kinetic characteristics as the sequence of phase formation. The modification of the energy levels of the different phases brought about by stress, ion bombardment, or the replacement of usual phases by metastable ones, are considered with respect to their effect on nucleation processes. The nearly total absence of literature references to nucleation in metal-metal diffusion couples is discussed with respect to some specific aspects of the metal-silicon reactions.},

	abstract = {A new polymorph of NaSbO3 has been synthesized at 10.5 GPa and 1150 °C in a uniaxial split sphere anvil type press (USSA-2000) and recovered back to ambient conditions. The high-pressure form of NaSbO3 adopts an orthorhombically distorted perovskite structure, isostructural with CaTiO3, GdFeO3, and NaTaO3. The space group is Pnma, and the unit cell dimensions are a ) 5.43835(6) Å, b ) 7.66195(8) Å, c ) 5.38201(5) Å. It is a white insulator with an optical band gap of 3.4 eV. This compound represents the first ternary perovskite prepared containing Sb5+ on the octahedral site. The octahedral tilting distortion in this compound is much larger than expected from ionic radii considerations. The distortion is driven by a second-order Jahn-Teller distortion originating on oxygen that can be traced back to strong Sb-O covalent bonding. A conflict arises between the strong covalent bonding interactions at oxygen that favor a large octahedral tilting distortion and the repulsive Na-O interactions that oppose excessive octahedral tilting. This conflict destabilizes the perovskite topology, thereby stabilizing the ilmenite polymorph under ambient conditions. Analysis of ionic and covalent bonding explains why ASbO3 and ABiO3 compositions frequently adopt structures that violate Pauling’s rules.},

Crystals of the hexahydroxometallates were obtained by dissolving appropriate amounts of alkaline-earth nitrates or hydroxides and transition-metal oxides, acetates, or chlorides in the hydroﬂux and reacting at 180−230 °C. The isostructural compounds all crystallize in the monoclinic space group P21/n. The monoclinic structure consists of isolated transition-metal octahedra within a three-dimensional framework of corner- and edge-shared eight-coordinate, alkaline-earth polyhedra. Magnetic susceptibility data show that all compounds are simple paramagnets. Thermogravimetric analysis indicates that these hydroxides lose water between 215 and 350 °C and transform into oxide products, the identity of which depends on the metal cations present in the parent hexahydroxometallates.},

	abstract = {Magnetic antiperovskites, holding chiral noncollinear antiferromagnetic ordering, have shown remarkable properties that cover from negative thermal expansion to anomalous Hall effect. Nevertheless, details on the electronic structure related to the oxidation states and the octahedral center's site effect are still scarce. Here, we show a theoretical study, based on first-principles calculations in the framework of the density-functional theory, DFT, on the electronic details associated with the nitrogen site effect into the structural, electronic, magnetic, and topological degrees of freedom. Thus, we show that the nitrogen-vacancy increases the values of the anomalous Hall conductivity and retains the chiral \${\textbackslash}Gamma\_\{4g\}\$ antiferromagnetic ordering. Moreover, we reveal, based on the Bader charges and the electronic structure analysis, the negative and positive oxidation states in the Ni and Mn sites, respectively. The latter is in agreement with the expected \$A\_3{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}alpha+\}B{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}beta-\}X{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}delta-\}\$ oxidation states to satisfy the charge neutrality in the antiperovskites, but rare for transition metals. Finally, we extrapolate our findings on the oxidation states to several Mn\$\_3B\$N compounds showing that the antiperovskite structure is an ideal platform to encounter negative oxidation states in metals sitting at the corner \$B\$-site.},

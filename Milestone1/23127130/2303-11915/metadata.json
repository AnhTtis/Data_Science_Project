    "abstract": "Synthesis remains a challenge for advancing materials science. A key focus of this challenge is how to enable selective synthesis, particularly as it pertains to metastable materials. This perspective addresses the question: how can ``spectator'' elements, such as those found in double ion exchange (metathesis) reactions, enable selective materials synthesis? By observing reaction pathways as they happen (\\emph{in situ}) and calculating their energetics using modern computational thermodynamics, we observe transient, crystalline intermediates that suggest that many reactions attain a local thermodynamic equilibrium dictated by local chemical potentials far before achieving a global equilibrium set by the average composition. Using this knowledge, one can thermodynamically ``shortcut'' unfavorable intermediates by including additional elements beyond those of the desired target, providing access to a greater number of intermediates with advantageous energetics and selective phase nucleation. Ultimately, data-driven modeling that unites first-principles approaches with experimental insights will refine the accuracy of emerging predictive retrosynthetic models for complex materials synthesis.",

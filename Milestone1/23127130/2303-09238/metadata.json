    "abstract": "Natural interactions among multiple quantum objects are fundamentally composed of two-body terms only. In contradistinction, single global unitaries that generate highly entangled states usually arise from Hamiltonians that couple multiple individual subsystems simultaneously. Is it then possible to create strongly nonclassical multipartite correlations with a single unitary generated by the natural interactions? How does the two-body restriction influence the time required for that? We answer these questions by studying the unitary evolutions of quantum states that are generated by Hamiltonians with two-body interactions. Our main focus is on the fastest generation of multipartite entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ), W, Dicke and absolutely maximally entangled (AME) states for up to seven qubits. These results are obtained by constraining the energy in the system and accordingly can be seen as state-dependent quantum speed limits for natural interactions. They give rise to a counter-intuitive effect where the creation of particular entangled states with an increasing number of particles does not require more time. The methods used rely on extensive numerical simulations and analytical estimations.",

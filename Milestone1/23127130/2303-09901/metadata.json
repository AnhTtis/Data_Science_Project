    "abstract": "This paper presents the winning system for the zero-shot Spanish framing detection task, which also achieves competitive places in eight additional languages. The challenge of the framing detection task lies in identifying a set of 14 frames when only a few or zero samples are available, i.e., a multilingual multi-label few- or zero-shot setting. Our developed solution employs a pre-training procedure based on multilingual Transformers using a label-aware contrastive loss function. In addition to describing the system, we perform an embedding space analysis and ablation study to demonstrate how our pre-training procedure supports framing detection to advance computational framing analysis.",

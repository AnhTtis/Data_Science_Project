    "abstract": "Integrated arrays of Superconducting Nanowire Single Photon Detectors (SNSPDs) have shown capabilities such as Photon Number Resolution, single photon imaging and coincidences detection, and can be effectively used also in other different applications related to quantum optics. The growing complexity of such applications requires the use of multiplexing schemes for the simultaneous readout of different detectors. A simple multiplexing scheme can be realized by arranging a series of SNSPDs elements, shunted by appropriate resistances. The goal of this work is to investigate and optimize this scheme, developing a general method able to identify the optimal sets of shunting resistences for any different application. The methodology obtained is very general, and can be extended to other detection systems.",

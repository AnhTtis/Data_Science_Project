    "abstract": "Integrating measurements and historical data can enhance control systems through learning-based techniques, but ensuring performance and safety is challenging. Robust model predictive control strategies, like stochastic model predictive control, can address this by accounting for uncertainty. Gaussian processes are often used but have limitations with larger models and data sets. We explore Bayesian neural networks for stochastic learning-assisted control, comparing their performance to Gaussian processes on a wastewater treatment plant model. Results show Bayesian neural networks achieve similar performance, highlighting their potential as an alternative for control designs, particularly when handling extensive data sets.",

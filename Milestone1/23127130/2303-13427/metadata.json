    "abstract": "Viazovska proved that the $E_8$ lattice sphere packing is the densest sphere packing in 8 dimensions. Her proof relies on two inequalities between functions defined in terms of modular and quasimodular forms. We give a direct proof of these inequalities that does not rely on computer calculations.",

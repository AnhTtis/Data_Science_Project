    "abstract": "Instrumental variable (IV) strategies are widely used in political science to establish causal relationships. However, the identifying assumptions required by an IV design are demanding, and it remains challenging for researchers to assess their validity. In this paper, we replicate 67 papers published in three top journals in political science during 2010-2022 and identify several troubling patterns. First, researchers often overestimate the strength of their IVs due to non-i.i.d. errors, such as a clustering structure. Second, the most commonly used t-test for the two-stage-least-squares (2SLS) estimates often severely underestimates uncertainty. Using more robust inferential methods, we find that around 19-30% of the 2SLS estimates in our sample are underpowered. Third, in the majority of the replicated studies, the 2SLS estimates are much larger than the ordinary-least-squares estimates, and their ratio is negatively correlated with the strength of the IVs in studies where the IVs are not experimentally generated, suggesting potential violations of unconfoundedness or the exclusion restriction. To help researchers avoid these pitfalls, we provide a checklist for better practice.",

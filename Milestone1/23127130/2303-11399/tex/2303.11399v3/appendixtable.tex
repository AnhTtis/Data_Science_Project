regime, the secret police’s ability to servile citizens

retired.'' (p.565)  \\ \hline

  \cite{kocher2011}    & Past insurgent control & Aerial bombing  & Changes in local control&Theory (Other)& ``Because instrumental variables require only conditional independence between instruments and the error term, we need only assume that there are no unobserved hamlet-specific variables that affected insurgent control in July, August, and December 1969, but not in September of that year as well."

\cite{blair2022peacekeeping}    &Average fragmentation of all ongoing PKO mandates&Fragmentation of any given PKO mandate&Process performance &Theory (Other)& ``We view the first of these assumptions as mostly uncontroversial. As discussed above, most PKO mandates are only loosely tailored to conditions in their host countries. It is highly unlikely that the mandates of all other PKOs in Africa are tailored to the host country conditions of any given PKO. This should mitigate independence concerns.'' (p.11)  \\ \hline

\cite{hong2022strongman}&Geographic terrain elevation and slope& NVM subsidies&Park’s vote share in 2012 &Theory (Geography)& ``The logic behind this choice is as follows: each village’s performance in the NVM is evaluated based on their baseline conditions. Therefore, an unfavorable terrain before the movement likely indicates an initial lack of infrastructure in a poorer environment, and thus gives a village an advantageous benchmark from which to generate a notable and visible improvement within a short period compared to other villages.''

\cite{gehlbach2012}   &Whether the first ruler in a nondemocratic episode is a military leader &Age of ruling party less leader years in office & Private investment/GDP&Theory&  ``[D]ictators who come to power with the backing of the military require less popular support to remain in power and are therefore less likely to promote private investment by allowing supporters to organize."

(p. 1027) \\ \hline



\cite{dube2015} &US military aid to countries outside of Latin America&US military aid to Colombia&The number of paramilitary attacks&Theory (Diffusion)& ``The instrument is valid since US funding to the rest of the world is determined by the broad geopolitical outlook of the American government, reflecting factors such as the party of the president or other major world events, and can thus be considered exogenous to the conflict in Colombia."(p.256) \\ \hline

\cite{flores-macias2013}   & Lagged values of country's energy production & Trade volume & Foreign policy convergence &Theory (Other)& ``The logic is that trade and trade salience in Africa and Latin America are significantly related to countries’ energy production, but there is no reason to believe that either of them is correlated with the error term in the equation predicting foreign policy convergence" (p. 365) \\ \hline


\cite{charron2013}    & Consolidation of clientelistic networks in regions where rulers have historically less constraints to their decisions & Clientelism & Quality of government &Theory (History)& ``[W]e also find that constraints are directly correlated with current regional institutional quality (yet in his analysis regional GDP and GDP growth are used), thus rendering it an imperfect instrument for clientelism"(p.576) \\ \hline


\cite{kriner2014}   & Number of days Congress is in session & Committee investigations & Presidential approval &Theory (Other)& ``[T]here is no theoretical reason drawn from existing literatures to expect the calendar to be independently correlated with presidential approval." (p. 525)  \\ \hline

\cite{feigenbaum2015}    & Chinese exports to other economies $\times$local exposure & Localized trade shocks in congressional districts & Trade score &Econometrics (Interaction)&  ``[We] use an instrument that depends [...] on Chinese import growth to other rich, Western economies" and "the lagged version is unaffected by Chinese trade shock."

\cite{johns2016}    & Trade stake of the rest of the world& The number of other countries that became third parties & Becoming a third party &Theory (Other)&  ``[E]ach state’s participation decision is not directly affected by the trade stake of other countries. The trade stake of other countries matters only to the extent that it shapes a player’s belief about how other countries will behave." (p. 99) \\ \hline



\cite{acharya2016political}  & Measures of the environmental suitability for growing cotton & Slave proportion in 1860 & proportion Democrat &Theory (History)& ``We present results from this analysis showing that, outside the South, the relationship between cotton suitability and political attitudes is either very small or in the opposite direction as in the South." (p. 628) \\ \hline



% \cite{marshall2016}    & 1947 school reform & Years of schooling & Vote conservatives &Rules \& policy changes (Change in exposure)& ``selection into cohorts in Britain is implausible since parents could not have precisely predicted the 1947 reform more than a decade in advance", "since cohorts born either side of the cutoff were first eligible to vote in the 1955 election, there is no differential “first election” effect" and "pretreatment demographic, socioeconomic, and labor market characteristics are essentially continuous" (p. 386). \\ \hline 


\cite{schleiter2016}    & Prime Minister dissolution power& Opportunistic election calling& Vote share of Prime Minister's party &Theory (Other)& ``The instrument correlates directly with the treatment of interest—opportunistic election calling—without being linked to anticipated incumbent electoral performance."

(p.97)\\ \hline


\cite{west2017}  & IEM (prediction market) price &Obama win & Policy efficacy &Theory (Other)& ``The identifying assumption is that there is no unobservable factor that simultaneously affects black (female) political efficacy and perceptions of the likelihood of an Obama (Clinton) victory." (p.352)\\ \hline


\cite{stewart2017}    & Log total border length and the total number of that state’s neighbors & Foreign territorial control & Civilian casualties &Theory (Geography)& ``[T]he longer a state’s borders or the greater its number of neighbors, the more accessible border regions in neighboring states will be to rebels, independent of the dynamics of their conflict with the government. Further, total border length or the number of bordering states is not likely to affect rebel targeting of civilians other than through their effects on the likelihood of rebel group’s controlling foreign territory." (p. 291) \\ \hline


\cite{lerman2017}   & Born 1946 or 1947& Public (p 1) versus only private (p 0) health insurance & Support ACA &Rules \& policy changes (Change in exposure)& ``We can confirm across a host of observable covariates that these two age groups are similar on almost every dimension, with the exception of insurance."

\cite{bhavnani2018}  & Early-career job assignment to districts &Bureaucrats’ embeddedness & Proportion of villages with high schools &Theory (Other)& ``[T]he IAS posting orders that we obtained suggest that heuristics such alphabetical order and serial number—which are arbitrary and orthogonal to district and officer characteristics—are used to match officers to districts."

\cite{arias2019large}   & Trade shock $\times$ UK bond yield & Government expenditures & Regular leader turnover  &Econometrics (Interaction)& ``The logic here is that when costs of external borrowing are high, a government experiencing a trade shock is more likely to cut expenditures because the option of borrowing to maintain or increase expenditures is too costly.

\cite{digiuseppe2022us} &Echelon corridor & US support & Fiscal capacity & Theory(Geography)& ``Like Aklin and Kern (2019), we ﬁnd that the echelon is plausibly exogenous to a state’s capacity, property rights, or risk of conﬂict. Instead, whether a state is located in the echelon corridor is a function of happenstance geography.''(p.777)\\ \hline

\cite{lei2022private} &Whether the city has more than 3 million residents & Subway approval & Mayor promotion & Rules \& policy changes (Fuzzy RD)& ``the city’s population exceeds 3 million people, and (4) more than 30,000 people per hour are expected to use a subway line''(p.463)\\ \hline

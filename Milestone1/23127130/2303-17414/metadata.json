    "abstract": "It is well-known that $QI(\\mathbb{R})\\cong(QI(\\mathbb{R}_{+})\\times QI(\\mathbb{R}_{-}))\\rtimes <t>$, where $QI(\\mathbb{R})$(resp. $QI(\\mathbb{R}_{+})(\\cong QI(\\mathbb{R_-}))$) is the group of quasi-isometries of the real line (resp. $[0,\\infty)$). We introduce an invariant for the elements of $QI(\\mathbb{R_{+}})$ and split it into smaller units. We give an almost characterization of the elements of these units. We also show that a quotient of $QI(\\mathbb{R_{+}})$ gives an example of a left-orderable group which is not locally indicable.",

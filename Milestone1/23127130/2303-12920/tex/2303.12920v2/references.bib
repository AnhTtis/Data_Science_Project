abstract = {The Microsoft Kinect camera is becoming increasingly popular in many areas aside from entertainment, including human activity monitoring and rehabilitation. Many people, however, fail to consider the reliability and accuracy of the Kinect human pose estimation when they depend on it as a measuring system. In this paper we compare the Kinect pose estimation (skeletonization) with more established techniques for pose estimation from motion capture data, examining the accuracy of joint localization and robustness of pose estimation with respect to the orientation and occlusions. We have evaluated six physical exercises aimed at coaching of elderly population. Experimental results present pose estimation accuracy rates and corresponding error bounds for the Kinect system.}

abstract = {Clinically feasible methods of assessing postural control such as timed standing balance and functional reach tests provide important information, however, they cannot accurately quantify specific postural control mechanisms. The Microsoft Kinect\texttrademark system provides real-time anatomical landmark position data in three dimensions ({3D}), and given that it is inexpensive, portable and simple to setup it may bridge this gap. This study assessed the concurrent validity of the Microsoft Kinect\texttrademark against a benchmark reference, a multiple-camera {3D} motion analysis system, in 20 healthy subjects during three postural control tests: (i) forward reach, (ii) lateral reach, and (iii) single-leg eyes-closed standing balance. For the reach tests, the outcome measures consisted of distance reached and trunk flexion angle in the sagittal (forward reach) and coronal (lateral reach) planes. For the standing balance test the range and deviation of movement in the anatomical landmark positions for the sternum, pelvis, knee and ankle and the lateral and anterior trunk flexion angle were assessed. The Microsoft Kinect\texttrademark and {3D} motion analysis systems had comparable inter-trial reliability ({ICC} difference=0.06±0.05; range, 0.00-0.16) and excellent concurrent validity, with Pearson's r-values \textgreater0.90 for the majority of measurements (r=0.96±0.04; range, 0.84-0.99). However, ordinary least products analyses demonstrated proportional biases for some outcome measures associated with the pelvis and sternum. These findings suggest that the Microsoft Kinect\texttrademark can validly assess kinematic strategies of postural control. Given the potential benefits it could therefore become a useful tool for assessing postural control in the clinical setting. Copyright \copyright 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}

The suggested applications are for studies in the field of human movement. In the proposed {EKF}, the quaternion associated with the body rotation is included in the state vector together with the bias of the aiding system sensors. Moreover, in addition to the in-line procedure of sensor bias compensation, the measurement noise covariance matrix is adapted, to guard against the effects which body motion and temporary magnetic disturbance may have on the reliability of measurements of gravity and earth's magnetic field, respectively. By computer simulations and experimental validation with human hand orientation motion signals, improvements in the accuracy of orientation estimates are demonstrated for the proposed {EKF}, as compared with filter implementations where either the in-line calibration procedure, the adaptive mechanism for weighting the measurements of the aiding system sensors, or both are not implemented.}

abstract = {Mobile health tools that enable clinicians and researchers to monitor the type, quantity, and quality of everyday activities of patients and trial participants have long been needed to improve daily care, design more clinically meaningful randomized trials of interventions, and establish cost-effective, evidence-based practices. Inexpensive, unobtrusive wireless sensors, including accelerometers, gyroscopes, and pressure-sensitive textiles, combined with Internet-based communications and machine-learning algorithms trained to recognize upper- and lower-extremity movements, have begun to fulfill this need. Continuous data from ankle triaxial accelerometers, for example, can be transmitted from the home and community via {WiFi} or a smartphone to a remote data analysis server. Reports can include the walking speed and duration of every bout of ambulation, spatiotemporal symmetries between the legs, and the type, duration, and energy used during exercise. For daily care, this readily accessible flow of real-world information allows clinicians to monitor the amount and quality of exercise for risk factor management and compliance in the practice of skills. Feedback may motivate better self-management as well as serve home-based rehabilitation efforts. Monitoring patients with chronic diseases and after hospitalization or the start of new medications for a decline in daily activity may help detect medical complications before rehospitalization becomes necessary. For clinical trials, repeated laboratory-quality assessments of key activities in the community, rather than by clinic testing, self-report, and ordinal scales, may reduce the cost and burden of travel, improve recruitment and retention, and capture more reliable, valid, and responsive ratio-scaled outcome measures that are not mere surrogates for changes in daily impairment, disability, and functioning.}

abstract = {The primary focus of rehabilitation for individuals with loss of upper limb movement as a result of acquired brain injury is the relearning of specific motor skills and daily tasks. This relearning is essential because the loss of upper limb movement often results in a reduced quality of life. Although rehabilitation strives to take advantage of neuroplastic processes during recovery, results of traditional approaches to upper limb rehabilitation have not entirely met this goal. In contrast, enriched training tasks, simulated with a wide range of low- to high-end virtual reality-based simulations, can be used to provide meaningful, repetitive practice together with salient feedback, thereby maximizing neuroplastic processes via motor learning and motor recovery. Such enriched virtual environments have the potential to optimize motor learning by manipulating practice conditions that explicitly engage motivational, cognitive, motor control, and sensory feedback-based learning mechanisms. The objectives of this article are to review motor control and motor learning principles, to discuss how they can be exploited by virtual reality training environments, and to provide evidence concerning current applications for upper limb motor recovery. The limitations of the current technologies with respect to their effectiveness and transfer of learning to daily life tasks also are discussed. \copyright 2015 American Physical Therapy Association.}

Methodological quality was assessed using the Downs \& Black 'Checklist for Measuring Quality' tool. Results were pooled for meta-analysis based upon primary outcome measures and reported as standardised mean differences and 95\% confidence intervals ({CI}). {RESULTS}: Aggregate results suggest that telerehabilitation is effective in the improvement of physical function ({SMD} 1.63, 95\%{CI} 0.92-2.33, I2=93\%), whilst being slightly more favourable ({SMD} 0.44, 95\%{CI} 0.19-0.69, I2=58\%) than the control cohort following intervention. Sub-group analyses reveals that telerehabilitation in addition to usual care is more favourable ({SMD} 0.64, 95\%{CI} 0.43-0.85, I2=10\%) than usual care alone, whilst treatment delivered solely via telerehabilitation is equivalent to face-to-face intervention ({SMD} {MD} 0.14, 95\% {CI} -0.10-0.37, I2 = 0\%) for the improvement of physical function. The improvement of pain was also seen to be comparable between cohorts ({SMD} 0.66, 95\%{CI} -0.27-1.60, I2=96\%) following intervention. {CONCLUSIONS}: Real-time telerehabilitation appears to be effective and comparable to conventional methods of healthcare delivery for the improvement of physical function and pain in a variety of musculoskeletal conditions.}

Telerehabilitation sessions (16 per participant over two months) were conducted by trained physiotherapists using videoconferencing to the patient's home via an Internet connection (512 kbit/s upload speed). Disability and function were measured using standardized outcome measures in face-to-face evaluations at three times (prior to and at the end of treatment, and four months after the end of treatment). Clinical outcomes improved significantly for all subjects in both groups between endpoints. Some variables showed larger improvements in the usual care group two months post-discharge from therapy than in the telerehabilitation group. Home telerehabilitation is at least as effective as usual care, and has the potential to increase access to therapy in areas with high speed Internet services.}

Satisfaction of patients toward in-home telerehabilitation after {TKA} has not yet been examined thoroughly in large-scale clinical trials. This study aims to compare satisfaction level of patients following in-home telerehabilitation ({TELE}) after {TKA} to one of the patients following a usual face-to-face home visit ({STD}) rehabilitation. Secondarily, to determine if any clinical or personal variables were associated to the level of satisfaction. {MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: This study was embedded in a multicenter randomized controlled trial with 205 patients randomized into two groups. Rehabilitation intervention was the same for both groups; only approach for service delivery differed (telerehabilitation or home visits). Participants were assessed at baseline (before {TKA}), at hospital discharge, and at 2 and 4 months postdischarge (E4) using functional outcomes. Patient satisfaction was measured using the validated Health Care Satisfaction Questionnaire ({HCSQ}) at E4. {RESULTS}: Characteristics of all participants were similar at baseline. Satisfaction level of both groups did not differ and was very high (over 85\%). It was neither correlated to personal characteristics nor to improvements of functional level from preoperative to E4. Satisfaction was rather found associated to walking and stair-climbing performances. {CONCLUSIONS}: These results, in conjunction with evidences of clinical effectiveness and cost benefits demonstrated in the same sample of patients, strongly support the use of telerehabilitation to improve access to rehabilitation services and efficiency of service delivery after {TKA}.}

Twelve studies were included involving different populations (i.e. neurological, total knee arthroplasty ({TKA}), cardiac) of patients. Inconclusive finding were found on the effect of telerehabilitation for neurological patients ({SMD} = 0.08, {CI} 95\% = -0.13, 0.29), while both for cardiac ({SMD} = 0.24, {CI} 95\% = 0.04, 0.43) and {TKA} patients (Timed Up and Go test: {MD} = -5.17, {CI} 95\% = -9.79, -0.55) the results were in favour of telerehabilitation.Conclusive evidence on the efficacy of telerehabilitation for treatment of motor function, regardless of pathology, was not reached. Nevertheless, a strong positive effect was found for patients following orthopaedic surgery, suggesting that the increased intensity provided by telerehabilitation is a promising option to be offered to patients. More and higher quality research is needed in this field especially with neurological patients. \copyright The Author(s) 2015 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/{journalsPermissions}.nav.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Stroke is a leading cause of disability worldwide, with upper limb deficits affecting an estimated 30\% to 60\% of survivors. The effectiveness of upper limb rehabilitation relies on numerous factors, particularly patient compliance to home programs and exercises set by therapists. However, therapists lack objective information about their patients' adherence to rehabilitation exercises as well as other uses of the affected arm and hand in everyday life outside the clinic. We developed a system that consists of wearable sensor technology to monitor a patient's arm movement and a Web-based dashboard to visualize this information for therapists. {OBJECTIVE}: The aim of our study was to evaluate how therapists use upper limb movement information visualized on a dashboard to support the rehabilitation process. {METHODS}: An interactive dashboard prototype with simulated movement information was created and evaluated through a user-centered design process with therapists (N=8) at a rehabilitation clinic. Data were collected through observations of therapists interacting with an interactive dashboard prototype, think-aloud data, and interviews. Data were analyzed qualitatively through thematic analysis. {RESULTS}: Therapists use visualizations of upper limb information in the following ways: (1) to obtain objective data of patients' activity levels, exercise, and neglect outside the clinic, (2) to engage patients in the rehabilitation process through education, motivation, and discussion of experiences with activities of daily living, and (3) to engage with other clinicians and researchers based on objective data. A major limitation is the lack of contextual data, which is needed by therapists to discern how movement data visualized on the dashboard relate to activities of daily living. {CONCLUSIONS}: Upper limb information captured through wearable devices provides novel insights for therapists and helps to engage patients and other clinicians in therapy. Consideration needs to be given to the collection and visualization of contextual information to provide meaningful insights into patient engagement in activities of daily living. These findings open the door for further work to develop a fully functioning system and to trial it with patients and clinicians during therapy. {\copyrightBernd} Ploderer, Justin Fong, Marlena Klaic, Siddharth Nair, Frank Vetere, L.

We present a novel dynamic approach that combines trajectory simplification and clustering techniques with the goal to support interpretation and understanding of movement patterns. Our technique provides smooth transitions between different abstraction types that can be computed dynamically and on-the-fly. This enables the analyst to effectively navigate and explore the space of possible abstractions in large trajectory data sets. Additionally, we provide a proof of concept for supporting the analyst in determining the {LoA} semi-automatically with a recommender system. Our approach is illustrated and evaluated by case studies, quantitative measures, and expert feedback. We further demonstrate that it allows analysts to solve a variety of analysis tasks in the domain of soccer.}

For example, many teams include both designers who create new visualization designs and developers who implement the resulting visualization software. We identify gaps between data characterization tools, visualization design tools, and development platforms that pose challenges for designer-developer teams working to create new data visualizations. While it is common for commercial interaction design tools to support collaboration between designers and developers, creating data visualizations poses several unique challenges that are not supported by current tools. In particular, visualization designers must characterize and build an understanding of the underlying data, then specify layouts, data encodings, and other data-driven parameters that will be robust across many different data values. In larger teams, designers must also clearly communicate these mappings and their dependencies to developers, clients, and other collaborators. We report observations and reflections from five large multidisciplinary visualization design projects and highlight six data-specific visualization challenges for design specification and handoff. These challenges include adapting to changing data, anticipating edge cases in data, understanding technical challenges, articulating data-dependent interactions, communicating data mappings, and preserving the integrity of data mappings across iterations. Based on these observations, we identify opportunities for future tools for prototyping, testing, and communicating data-driven designs, which might contribute to more successful and collaborative data visualization design.}

The movements included quiet standing, multidirectional reaching and stepping and walking on the spot, and the following items from the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale: hand clasping, finger tapping, foot, leg agility, chair rising and hand pronation. Outcomes included mean timing and range of motion across movement repetitions. {RESULTS}: The Kinect measured timing of movement repetitions very accurately (low bias, 95\% limits of agreement \textless 10\% of the group mean, {ICCs} \textgreater0.9 and Pearson's r\textgreater0.9). However, the Kinect had varied success measuring spatial characteristics, ranging from excellent for gross movements such as sit-to-stand ({ICC}=.989) to very poor for fine movement such as hand clasping ({ICC}=.012). Despite this, results from the Kinect related strongly to those obtained with the Vicon system (Pearson's r\textgreater0.8) for most movements. {CONCLUSIONS}: The Kinect can accurately measure timing and gross spatial characteristics of clinically relevant movements but not with the same spatial accuracy for smaller movements, such as hand clasping.

abstract = {Cardiovascular disease remains a significant chronic healthcare problem in this country, with considerable associated economic and quality-of-life challenges. Along with these challenges, there is high demand for healthcare provider time, particularly in the areas of management of complex healthcare needs and patient education. At the same time, a critical nursing shortage exists. Telehealth technologies provide opportunities to meet the rapidly growing needs of consumers and healthcare practitioners. Many in need of services have limited access to high-end technologies. An argument has been made that the lowest level of technology needed to carry out a task should be used, if it is capable of providing the necessary services. Videoconferencing capabilities allow healthcare practitioners to engage in virtual face-to-face encounters with patients or other healthcare providers. A variety of levels of sophistication in these videoconferencing systems are available. In an effort to evaluate the effectiveness and consumer satisfaction with videoconferencing, 3 pilot studies were conducted to compare face-to-face, low-bandwidth, and high-bandwidth approaches to performing common assessments and patient education activities. In one study, a variety of experienced healthcare practitioners performed functional assessments of stroke subjects using a collection of validated scales by varying approaches (face-to-face, low-bandwidth, and high-bandwidth videoconferencing) in a randomized order. In a second study, undergraduate nursing students performed similar performance measures and taught an unfamiliar individual how to program and use an intravenous pump device, take a tympanic temperature, or to draw up insulin in a syringe. In the third study, advanced practice nursing students assessed vital signs and performed cardiopulmonary assessments on community-dwelling subjects using low-bandwidth and face-to-face approaches. Healthcare practitioners and students generally preferred high-bandwidth approaches over low-bandwidth alternatives when videoconferencing was performed; however, most participants and practitioners were satisfied with the encounters, regardless of the level of technology used.}

abstract = {With the rise of virtual reality experiences for applications in entertainment, industry, science and medicine, the evaluation of human motion in immersive environments is becoming more important. By analysing the motion of virtual reality users, design choices and training progress in the virtual environment can be understood and improved. Since the motion is captured in a virtual environment, performing the analysis in the same environment provides a valuable context and guidance for the analysis. We have created a visual analysis system that is designed for immersive visualisation and exploration of human motion data. By combining suitable data mining algorithms with immersive visualisation techniques, we facilitate the reasoning and understanding of the underlying motion. We apply and evaluate this novel approach on a relevant {VR} application domain to identify and interpret motion patterns in a meaningful way.}

abstract = {The present research investigates the effectiveness of using a telepresence system compared to a video conferencing system and the effectiveness of using two cameras compared to one camera for remote physical therapy. We used Telegie as our telepresence system, which allowed users to see an environment captured with {RGBD} cameras in {3D} through a {VR} headset. Since both telepresence and the inclusion of a second camera provide users with additional spatial information, we examined this affordance within the relevant context of remote physical therapy. Our dyadic study across different time zones paired 11 physical therapists with 76 participants who took on the role of patients for a remote session. Our quantitative questionnaire data and qualitative interviews with therapists revealed several important findings. First, after controlling for individual differences among participants, using two cameras had a marginally significant positive effect on physical therapy assessment scores from therapists. Second, the spatial ability of patients was a strong predictor of therapist assessment. And third, the video clarity of remote communication systems mattered. Based on our findings, we offer several suggestions and insights towards the future use of telepresence systems for remote communication.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Adhesive capsulitis ({AC}) of the shoulder is a common disorder that painfully reduces the shoulder range of motion ({ROM}) among middle-aged individuals. Although physical therapy with home-based exercises is widely advised to restore {ROM} in the treatment of {AC}, clinical results vary owing to inconsistent patient compliance. {OBJECTIVE}: In this study, we aimed to verify the feasibility of a treatment model that involves applying a wearable motion sensor device to assist patients conduct home-based exercises to improve training compliance and the accuracy of exercises, with the ultimate goal of improving the functional recovery of patients with {AC}. {METHODS}: The motion sensor device was comprised of inertial measurement unit-based sensors and mobile apps for patients and physicians, offering shoulder mobility tracing, home-based exercise support, and progress monitoring. The interrater reliability of shoulder mobility measurement using the motion sensor device on 10 healthy participants and 15 patients with {AC} was obtained using an intraclass correlation coefficient analysis and compared with the assessments performed by two highly experienced physicians. A pilot prospective control trial was then carried out to allocate the 15 patients with {AC} to two groups: home-based exercise group and motion sensor-assisted rehabilitation group. Changes in active and passive shoulder {ROM}, pain and functional scores, and exercise completion rates were compared between the groups during a treatment period of 3 months. {RESULTS}: Shoulder {ROM}, as measured using the motion sensor device, exhibited good to excellent reliability based on the comparison with the measurements of two physicians (intraclass correlation coefficient range, 0.771 to 0.979). Compared with patients with {AC} in the home-based exercise group, those in the motion sensor-assisted rehabilitation group exhibited better shoulder mobility and functional recovery and a higher exercise completion rate during and after 3 months of rehabilitation. {CONCLUSIONS}: Motion sensor device-assisted home-based rehabilitation for the treatment of {AC} is a useful treatment model for telerehabilitation that enhances the compliance of patients through training, thus improving functional recovery. This helps overcome important obstacles in physiotherapy at home by providing comprehensible and easily accessible exercise instructions, enhancing compliance, ensuring the correctness of exercise, and monitoring the progress of patients. {\copyrightYu}-Pin Chen, Chung-Ying Lin, Ming-Jr Tsai, Tai-Yuan Chuang, Oscar Kuang-Sheng Lee.

abstract = {This paper describes the design of "{ArmSleeve}", a patient monitoring system to support occupational therapists in their upper limb rehabilitation work with stroke patients. Occupational therapists can provide rehabilitation in clinics, but they have limited insights into how much their patients use their affected arm and hand in daily life, which is critical for effective recovery to occur. Our work addresses this problem through three interrelated studies: (1) interviews with therapists to examine their current rehabilitation practices; (2) the design of the "{ArmSleeve} Sensor" to monitor a patient's upper limb movement; and (3) the design and evaluation of the "{ArmSleeve} Dashboard" to visualize this information for therapists. The findings show the importance of collecting objective data to assess exercise and activities outside therapy, but also a lack of contextual information to interpret this data. We discuss considerations for how to address this issue through patient engagement as well as considerations for designing wearable sensor technology that is usable in everyday life.},

    "abstract": "The computation of the normaliser of a permutation group in the full symmetric group is an important and hard problem in computational group theory. This article reports on an algorithm that builds a descending chain of overgroups to determine the normaliser. A detailed performance test in magma shows the improvement for large examples of intransitive and imprimitive groups.",

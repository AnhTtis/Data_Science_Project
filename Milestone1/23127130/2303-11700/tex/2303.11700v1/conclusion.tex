\section{Conclusion}
Streaming recommendation has attracted great attention due to the dynamics of the real world. %However, existing methods are either impractical due to the strict data regulations, or suffer from the \textit{over-stability} issue. Also, they are challenged by the ever-increasing users and intermittent user activities.
In this paper, we first propose the temporal preference modeling as the user embedding initialization of each time segment. Then, we start from the \textit{model isolation} perspective and propose the \textit{historical graph convolution pruning and refining} and \textit{graph convolution expanding and pruning} operations, in such ways to only preserve useful long-term preferences and further extract current short-term preferences. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets and three most representative GCN-based recommendation models also demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method. %In the future, we will explore how to improve the model update speed to achieve a more real-time streaming recommendation effect.

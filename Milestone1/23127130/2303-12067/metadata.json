    "abstract": "Cyber-physical systems, also known as CPS, is an emerging field of technology that combines the physical and digital worlds by allowing for seamless interaction and communication between the two. One of the key characteristics of a CPS is its ability to take input from its environment and use that information to produce an output through actuators in the physical world. A balancing robot is a prime example of a CPS, as it uses input from its sensors to continually monitor its orientation and take action to prevent falling over by generating thrust through its wheels or manipulating its inertia. In this specific project, a two-wheel self-balancing robot was developed, utilizing the concept of a reverse pendulum. A reverse pendulum by default is inherently unstable and requires an external force to maintain its balance. In this case, the balancing robot produces this external force through the use of wheels and motors. To achieve precise balancing, stepper motors were utilized in the design of the robot. Additionally, the robot has the capability to move in four basic directions and the movement is controlled through an app connected to the robot via Bluetooth. This allows for remote control and monitoring of the robot's movements and actions. Overall, the development of this two-wheel self-balancing robot serves as a demonstration of the potential and capabilities of cyber-physical systems technology.",

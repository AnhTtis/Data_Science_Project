\section{Conclusion}
We propose \modelname for real-time instance segmentation. Built on a query-based segmentation framework~\cite{cheng2021mask2former} and three designed efficient components, \ie, instance activation-guided queries, dual-path update strategy, and ground truth mask-guided learning, \modelname achieves excellent performance on the popular COCO dataset while maintaining a fast inference speed. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of core ideas and the superiority of \modelname over previous state-of-the-art real-time counterparts. We hope this work can serve as a new baseline for real-time instance segmentation and promote the development of query-based image segmentation algorithms. 

\noindent\textbf{Limitations.} (1) Like general query-based models~\cite{detr, cheng2021mask2former,li2021panopticsegformer}, \modelname is not good at small targets. Even though using stronger pixel decoders or larger feature maps improves it, it introduces heavier computational burdens, and the result is still unsatisfactory. We look forward to an essential solution to handle this problem. (2) although GT mask-guided learning improves the performance of masked attention, it increases training costs. We hope a more elegant method can be proposed to replace it.

    "abstract": "It is a longstanding conjecture that every simple drawing of a complete graph on $n\\geq 3$ vertices contains a crossing-free Hamiltonian cycle. We confirm this conjecture for cylindrical drawings, strongly $c$-monotone drawings, as well as $x$-bounded drawings. Moreover, we introduce the stronger question of whether a crossing-free Hamiltonian path between each pair of vertices always exists.",

\begin{abstract}
The Gini index is a function that attempts to measure the amount of inequality in the distribution of a finite resource throughout a population. It is commonly used in economics as a measure of inequality of income or wealth. We define a discrete Gini index on the set of integer partitions with at most $n$ parts and show how this function emerges in the representation theory of the complex general linear group.

\section{Introduction}
The Gini index, originally defined in 1912 by the Italian statistician Corrado Gini \cite{Gini:1}, is a function that measures statistical dispersion. Traditionally used in economics to measure how equitably a resource is distributed throughout a population, the Gini index has found a wide range of modern applications in fields including biology \cite{Biology:1}, the medical sciences \cite{Medical:1}, and climate science \cite{Climate:1}.

We will review the discretization of the Gini index to the set of partitions of an integer defined in \cite{Kopitzke:1}, and will extend this discretization to the more general setting of partitions with a fixed number of parts. In section 3, we review the representation theory of the complex general linear group, $GL_n(\mathbb{C})$, of $n\times n$ invertible matrices -- with an emphasis on representations of $GL_n(\mathbb{C})$-harmonic polynomials. We will then show how the discrete Gini index appears in this setting as the top homogeneous degree in which an irreducible rational representation of the general linear group occurs as a factor in the $GL_n(\mathbb{C})$-harmonic polynomials (Theorem \ref{theorem1}). Finally, we will discuss the discrete one-dimensional Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) defined on sets of integer compositions, and show that the discrete Gini index is a restriction of the EMD to sets of partitions.

\section{The discrete Gini index}

%Subsection 2.1 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{The Gini index of an integer partition}

 The classical Gini index is usually defined in terms of Lorenz curves. The Lorenz curve of a distribution is the graph of a function $L$ for which $L(x)$ is the percentage of total wealth possessed by the poorest $x$ percent of the population \cite{Lorenz:1}. From this definition it follows that, regardless of the distribution, $L$ will be an increasing convex function on the interval from $0$ to $1$, $L(0)=0$, and $L(1)=1$. 
 
 The data sets we use to measure inequality are necessarily discrete. As such, Lorenze curves are often approximated with a smooth curve \cite{Jantzen:1}, or by turning a discrete data set into a continous function via linear interpolation \cite{Farris:1}. Bypassing this process, a discrete version of the Gini index was defined in \cite{Kopitzke:1} as follows. Let $\lambda=\left(\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\ldots,\lambda_n\right)$ be a partition of an integer $n$ -- that is, a finite tuple of $n$ non-negative decreasing integers whose sum is equal to $n$. Each such partition corresponds to a wealth distribution in which there are $n$ dollars distributed among $n$ people such that the most wealthy person has $\lambda_1$ dollars, and the least wealthy has $\lambda_n$ dollars. To measure the amount of inequality in the wealth distribution $\lambda$, the Gini index of $\lambda$ is then defined as 
\[g(\lambda)=\binom{n+1}{2}-\sum_{i=1}^ni\lambda_i. \]
This definition is best understood in terms of discrete Lorenz curves. The discrete Lorenz curve of an integer partition $\lambda$ of $n$ is defined on the interval from 0 to $n$ by
\[ L_{\lambda}(x)= \begin{cases} 
      0 & x= 0 \\
      \sum_{i=0}^{j-1}\lambda_{n-i} & x\in (j-1,j] \\
   \end{cases}
\]
where $j$ is any integer satisfying $1\leq j\leq n$. 
\begin{example}
\label{example1}
Suppose there are $5$ dollars distributed among a population of $5$ people according to the partition $(3,1,1,0,0)$. The most equitable distribution would be the so-called \emph{flat} partition $(1,1,1,1,1)$ in which each person has the same amount of money; the Lorenz curve of this distribution is sometimes called the \emph{line of equity} or the \emph{line of equality}. The Lorenz curves of each of these distributions are pictured in Figure~\ref{figure1}.\\
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=15cm]{figure1.JPG}
    \caption{The line of equality (dashed) and the Lorenz curve of the partition $(3,1,1,0,0)$ of $5$ (solid).}
    \label{figure1}
\end{figure}
\end{example}
The Gini index can be defined as the area between the Lorenz curve of the relevant distribution, and the line of equality. In Example~\ref{example1} we see that the Gini index of $(3,1,1,0,0)$ is 7. In general, the area under the line of equality will be the $n^{\text{th}}$ triangular number $\binom{n+1}{2}$ and the area under the Lorenz curve of a partition $\lambda$ of $n$ will be $\sum_{i=1}^ni\lambda_i$. Since the Lorenz curve of $\lambda$ will always coincide with the line of equality on the interval $(n-1,n]$, by subtracting $n$ from both areas we obtain a slightly simplified formula for the Gini index of $\lambda$
\[g(\lambda)=\binom{n}{2}-\sum_{i=1}^n(i-1)\lambda_i.  \]
The function $\sum_{i=1}^n(i-1)\lambda_i$ appears frequently throughout algebraic combinatorics and is sometimes referred to as the weighted total of the partition \cite{Macdonald:1}; thus we will adopt the function notation
\[ b(\lambda)=\sum_{i=1}^n(i-1)\lambda_i. \]

%Subsection 2.2 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{A generalization of the discrete Gini index}
The discrete Gini index in \cite{Kopitzke:1} is defined on the set of partitions of a positive integer $n$ by associating each partition with a wealth distribution in which $n$ dollars are distributed among $n$ people. This setting is unnecessarily restrictive, and can easily be generalized to allow for dollar amounts that are multiples of $n$. To that end, let $n$ and $k$ be positive integers, and consider a wealth distribution in which $nk$ dollars are distributed among $n$ people. The possible distributions are in one-to-one correspondence with the partitions of $nk$ with at most $n$ parts -- that is, tuples of $n$ non-increasing numbers whose sum is $nk$. 

The discrete Gini index can be generalized to this setting by extending the notion of the discrete Lorenz curve, and defining the Gini index of a distribution to be the area between the line of equality and the discrete Lorenz curve of the distribution. The Gini index in this setting is best understood via example. 

\begin{example}
\label{example2}
Suppose $15$ dollars are distributed among $5$ people according to the partition $\lambda=(6,4,3,1,1)$. The line of equality is the discrete Lorenz curve of the most equitable distribution, which in this setting is the flat partition $(3,3,3,3,3)$, or $(3^5)$ in simplified form. The discrete Lorenz curves for these distributions are pictured in Figure~\ref{figure2}.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=15cm]{figure2.JPG}
    \caption{The line of equality (dashed) and the discrete Lorenz curve (solid) of the partition $(6,4,3,1,1)$ of $15$ with $5$ parts.}
    \label{figure2}
\end{figure}
\end{example}
We define the Gini index $g_{15,5}(\lambda)$ of this distribution to be the area between the line of equality and the discrete Lorenz curve of $\lambda=(6,4,3,1,1)$: 
\[b\left((3^5)\right)-b\left(\lambda\right)=13.  \]
In general, if $n$ and $k$ are positive integers and $\lambda$ is a partition of $nk$ with at most $n$ parts, then the Gini index of $\lambda$ is the area between the line of equality (the discrete Lorenz curve of the flat partition $(k^n)$) and the discrete Lorenz curve of the $\lambda$:
\[ g_{nk,n}(\lambda)=b\left((k^n)\right)-b(\lambda). \]
Note that the subscripts on $g_{nk,n}$ are necessary to distinguish it from the less general discrete Gini index $g$, for which $k=1$.

\section{Representation theory}
This section provides a brief overview of the basic representation theory of the complex general linear group, and the structures relevant to our main result. Even so, some familiarity with the representation theory of classical groups is assumed. We now state our main result.

\begin{theorem}
\label{theorem1}
Let $V^{\alpha}$ be an irreducible rational representation of $GL_n(\mathbb{C})$ with highest weight $\alpha\in\mathbb{Z}^n$ such that $\alpha_1\geq\alpha_2\geq\cdots\geq\alpha_n$, and $\alpha_1+\alpha_2+\cdots+\alpha_n=0$. Let $\lambda=\alpha+(k^n)$, where $k$ is any integer such that $k\geq|\alpha_n|$. The top homogeneous degree in which $V^{\alpha}$ appears as a summand within the direct-sum decomposition of the representation $\mathcal{H}(\mathfrak{g})$ of $GL_n(\mathbb{C})$-harmonic polynomials is given by the Gini index, $  g_{nk,n}(\lambda).$
\end{theorem}

The proof of this result is provided in Section 3.3.

% Subsection 3.1 - Representation theory of GLN %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Representation theory of $GL_n(\mathbb{C})$}

%Define the basics for rep. theory. of GL_n ala Fulton, then provide Fulton's theorem of highest weights.

%Precise statement of the theorem of the highest weight
The general linear group, $GL_n(\mathbb{C})$ is the set of all $n\times n$ complex invertible matrices, equipped with the operation of matrix multiplication. A finite dimensional \footnote{Unless otherwise stated, all representations in this paper are finite dimensional.} representation of $GL_n(\mathbb{C})$ is a homomorphism $\rho:GL_n(\mathbb{C})\longrightarrow GL(V)$, where $GL(V)$ is the group of invertible linear transformations of a finite dimensional complex vector space $V$. The representation is \emph{rational} if, after choosing bases, $\rho(g)$ is a matrix whose entries are fixed rational functions in the matrix entries of $g$, where $g\in GL_n(\mathbb{C})$. Suppressing the function notation, the vector space $V$ is often referred to as the representation and we consider $GL_n(\mathbb{C})$ as acting on V. 

An irreducible representation (irrep) is a nonzero representation with no proper nontrivial subrepresentations. In other words, $V$ is irreducible if there are no subspaces $W\subset V$ that are closed under the action of $GL_n(\mathbb{C})$ restricted to $W$. The general linear group is \emph{reductive}, which implies that all rational representations can be written as a direct sum of irreducible rational representations. Irreps of $GL_n(\mathbb{C})$ are classified by the Theorem of the Highest Weight, which we now review.

Let $H$ denote the subgroup of $GL_n(\mathbb{C})$ of diagonal matrices. Let $V$ be a rational representation of $GL_n(\mathbb{C})$. A vector $v\in V$ has \emph{weight} $\alpha=(\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n)$ in $\mathbb{Z}^n$ if 
$x\cdot v=x_1^{\alpha_1}\cdots x_n^{\alpha_n}v$
for all $x=\text{diag}(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ in $H$ (here $\cdot$ denotes the action of $GL_n(\mathbb{C})$ on the representation $V$). 

Let $B$ denote the Borel subgroup of upper triangular matrices in $GL_n(\mathbb{C})$. The weight $\alpha$ of a vector $v\in V$ is called a \emph{highest weight} of $V$ if $B\cdot v=\mathbb{C}^*\cdot v$, where $\mathbb{C}^*$ is the set of all non-zero complex numbers. A rational representation is irreducible if and only if it has a unique highest weight. Two irreducible rational representations are isomorphic if and only if they have the same highest weight. These concepts are summarized in the Theorem of the Highest Weight.

\begin{thm}[Theorem of the Highest Weight]
For every tuple $\alpha=(\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n)\in\mathbb{Z}^n$ with $\alpha_1\geq \ldots\geq \alpha_n$, there is a unique irreducible rational representation $V^{\alpha}$ of $GL_n(\mathbb{C})$ with highest weight $\alpha$. Moreover, all such irreducible rational representations of $GL_n(\mathbb{C})$ are of this form.
\end{thm}

For more on the representation theory of $GL_n(\mathbb{C})$ we refer the reader to \cite{Fulton:1}, \cite{Stanley:1}, and \cite{Wallach:1}.

%The harmonic analysis of GLn, ending with a formula for the graded multiplicity using Kostant's partition function


The discrete Gini index, $g_{nk,n}$, arises in the representation theory of the general linear group as the top degree in which an irreducible rational representation appears as a direct summand in the harmonic polynomials of $GL_n(\mathbb{C})$ on its Lie algebra. In this section we provide a cursory overview of the $GL_n(\mathbb{C})-$harmonic polynomials.

Let $G=GL_n(\mathbb{C})$, and let $\mathfrak{g}$ be the complex Lie algebra of $G$ --- that is, the vector space of complex $n\times n$ matrices, $M_n(\mathbb{C})$. The general linear group acts on its Lie algebra by the Adjoint representation,
\[ g\cdot X\longrightarrow g^{-1}Xg, \]
for $g\in G$ and $X\in\mathfrak{g}$. Choose a basis $X_1,\ldots X_{n^2}$ for $\mathfrak{g}$, and define the algebra of polynomial functions on $\mathfrak{g}$ by identifying 
\[\mathbb{C}[\mathfrak{g}]=\mathbb{C}[X_1,\ldots,X_{n^2}].\]
This algebra is an infinite dimensional graded representation of $G$ with gradation
\[\mathbb{C}[\mathfrak{g}]=\bigoplus_{d\geq 0}\mathbb{C}[\mathfrak{g}]_d,\]
where $\mathbb{C}[\mathfrak{g}]_d$ is the vector space of homogeneous degree $d$ polynomials in $\mathbb{C}[\mathfrak{g}]$. The ring of $G-$invariant polynomials in $\mathbb{C}[\mathfrak{g}]$ is the set
\[ \mathbb{C}[\mathfrak{g}]^G=\left\{ f\in\mathbb{C}[\mathfrak{g}]:g\cdot f=f\text{ for all }g\in G \right\} .\]
The coinvariant ring of $G$ is the quotient
\[\mathbb{C}[\mathfrak{g}]_G=\mathbb{C}[\mathfrak{g}]/\mathbb{C}[\mathfrak{g}]_+^G\]
of the full polynomial ring by the ideal $\mathbb{C}[\mathfrak{g}]_+^G$ of $G-$invariant polynomials without constant term. 

Let $\partial_i=\frac{\partial}{\partial_{x_i}}$, and for $f\in\mathbb{C}[\mathfrak{g}]$, define $f(\partial)=f(\partial_1,\ldots,\partial_{n^2})$. The $G$-invariant differential operators with no constant term is the set 
\[\mathcal{D}(\mathfrak{g})_+^G=\left\{ f(\partial)|f\in\mathbb{C}[\mathfrak{g}]_+^G \right\}.\]
The module of $G-$harmonic polynomials on $\mathfrak{g}$ is then defined by
\[ \mathcal{H}\left(\mathfrak{g}\right)=\left\{f\in\mathbb{C}[\mathfrak{g}]|\Delta(f)=0\text{ for all }\Delta\in\mathcal{D}(\mathfrak{g})_+^G\right\} .\]
As a (infinite dimensional) representation of $G$, $\mathcal{H}\left(\mathfrak{g}\right)$ is isomorphic to the coinvariant ring $\mathbb{C}[\mathfrak{g}]_G$. It is also isomorphic to the $G$-representation algebraically induced from the trivial representation of a maximal algebraic torus $T$ in $G$. Frobenius reciprocity, therefore, shows that the irreducible rational representations of $G$ occur with multiplicity equal to the dimension of their zero weight space. 

The $G-$harmonic polynomials also form a graded representation of $GL_n(\mathbb{C})$;
\[ \mathcal{H}\left(\mathfrak{g}\right)=\bigoplus_{d=0}^{\infty}\mathcal{H}\left(\mathfrak{g}\right)^d, \]
where $\mathcal{H}^d\left(\mathfrak{g}\right)=\mathcal{H}\left(\mathfrak{g}\right)\cap\mathbb{C}[\mathfrak{g}]_d$. This fact is non-trivial, since it says that if a function is harmonic, then so are its homogeneous components. In general, every polynomial function can be expressed as a sum of $G-$invariant functions multiplied by $G$-harmonic polynomials. In other words, there is a surjection
\[\mathbb{C}[\mathfrak{g}]^G\otimes\mathcal{H}(\mathfrak{g})\longrightarrow\mathbb{C}[\mathfrak{g}]\longrightarrow0\]
obtained by linearly extending multiplication. This corresponds to the separation of variables that one does when studying the Laplace operator in two dimensions. The two tensor components correspond to the decomposition into radial and spherical parts, respectively. Kostant showed in \cite{Kostant:1} that the product of invariants and harmonics is unique, and thus
\[ \mathbb{C}[\mathfrak{g}]= \mathbb{C}[\mathfrak{g}]^G\otimes\mathcal{H}(\mathfrak{g}). \]

Each degree $d$ homogeneous component, $\mathcal{H}(\mathfrak{g})^d$, is a finite dimensional rational representation of $G$, and since $G$ is reductive, $\mathcal{H}(\mathfrak{g})^d$ decomposes into a finite direct sum of irreducible representations of $G$. We then pose the question, ``given an irreducible rational representation $V^{\alpha}$ of $GL_n(\mathbb{C})$ with highest weight $\alpha$, in what degrees does $V^{\alpha}$ occur in the direct sum decomposition of $\mathcal{H}(\mathfrak{g})^d$?" This question can be further formalized by considering the \emph{graded multiplicity} of the representation $V^{\alpha}$. 

If $V^{\alpha}$ is a finite dimensional irreducible rational representation of $G$ with highest weight $\alpha$, we denote by $\left[ V^{\alpha},\mathcal{H}(\mathfrak{g})^d\right]$ the multiplicity with which $V^{\alpha}$ occurs in the direct sum decomposition of the homogeneous degree $d$ harmonic polynomials, $\mathcal{H}(\mathfrak{g})^d$. The degrees in which and multiplicities with which the representation $V^{\alpha}$ occurs within the harmonic polynomials is summarized in what is called the \emph{graded multiplicity} polynomial of $V^{\alpha}$ in $\mathcal{H}(\mathfrak{g})$, and is defined\[m_{\alpha}(q)=\sum_{d=0}^{\infty}\left[V^{\alpha},\mathcal{H}(\mathfrak{g})^d\right] q^d,\] where $q$ is a dummy variable.
In simple terms, Theorem \ref{theorem1} states that for a given irreducible rational representation $V^{\alpha}$ of $GL_n(\mathbb{C})$, the graded multiplicity polynomial $m_{\alpha}(q)$ is either zero, or of degree $g_{nk,n}(\lambda)$, where $\lambda=\alpha+(k^n)$, and $k$ is any integer greater than $|\alpha_n|$. In other words, the maximal homogeneous degree in which an irreducible representation of $GL_n(\mathbb{C})$ appears in the $GL_n(\mathbb{C})-$harmonics is completely determined by the Gini index.

% Subsection 3.3 - Proof of Main result %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Kostka-Foulkes polynomials, and proof of main result}

Kostant's work in \cite{Kostant:1} shows that the only (non-zero) irreducible rational representations of $GL_n(\mathbb{C})$ whose graded multiplicities are non-zero are those with highest weights that sum to zero. That is, $m_{\alpha}(q)\neq 0$ only if $\alpha=(\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n)\in\mathbb{Z}^n$, where $\alpha\neq 0$, $\alpha_1\geq\ldots\geq\alpha_n$ and $\alpha_1+\cdots+\alpha_n=0$. Hence if $\lambda$ is a partition of $nk$ into at most $n$ parts, there is an integer tuple $\alpha$ of this form given by $\lambda=\alpha+(k^n)$, where $k\geq |\alpha_n|$. We will show that, in this setting, the degree of $m_{\alpha}(t)=g_{nk,n}(\lambda)$ by relating the graded multiplicities to \emph{Kostka-Foulkes polynomials}. 


Given two partitions $\lambda$ and $\mu$ of a positive integer $n$, the Kostka number $K_{\lambda\mu}$ is the number of semistandard Young tableaux of shape $\lambda$ and weight $\mu$. The Kostka numbers can also be defined as the coefficients obtained by expressing the Schur polynomial $s_{\lambda}$ as a linear combination of monomial symmetric functions $m_{\mu}$;
\[s_{\lambda}=\sum_{\mu}K_{\lambda\mu}m_{\mu}.\]
These numbers are significant in representation theory, as $K_{\lambda\mu}$ counts the dimension of the weight space corresponding to $\mu$ in the irreducible representation $V^{\lambda}$ with highest weight $\lambda$. This result is often expressed in terms of Kostant's partition function $\mathcal{P}:\mathbb{Z}^n\longrightarrow \mathbb{Z}$, which counts the number of ways in which a weight of the Lie aglebra $\mathfrak{sl}_n(\mathbb{C})$ can be expressed as a sum of positive roots of $\mathfrak{sl}_n(\mathbb{C})$. This function can also be defined as the coefficients in the series
\[ \sum_{\alpha\in\mathbb{Z}^n}\mathcal{P}(\alpha)x_1^{\alpha_1}\cdots x_n^{\alpha_n}=\prod_{1\leq i<j \leq n}\left(1-\frac{x_i}{x_j}\right)^{-1}, \]
where $x_1,\ldots,x_i$ are indeterminants. The Kostka numbers can then be written in terms of $\mathcal{P}$, yielding Kostant's weight multiplicity formula
\[ K_{\lambda\mu}=\sum_{w\in S_n}\epsilon(w)\mathcal{P}(w(\lambda+\rho)-(\mu+\rho)). \]
The $q-$analogue of Kostant's partition function can be defined as 
\[ \sum_{\alpha\in\mathbb{Z}^n}\mathcal{P}_q(\alpha)x_1^{\alpha_1}\cdots x_n^{\alpha_n}=\prod_{1\leq i<j\leq n}\left( 1-q\frac{x_i}{x_j} \right)^{-1} \]
Substituting $\mathcal{P}$ for its $q-$analogue, we obtain the Kostka-Foulkes polynomial
\[K_{\lambda\mu}(q)=\sum_{w\in S_n}\epsilon(w)\mathcal{P}_q(w(\lambda+\rho)-(\mu+\rho)).\]


A similar formulation for the graded multiplicity of an irreducible rational representation $V^{\alpha}$ of $GL_n(\mathbb{C})$ was found by Hesselink \cite{Hesselink:1}. If $\alpha\in\mathbb{Z}^n$ is decreasing and sums to zero, and if $\lambda=\alpha+(k^n)$, for any $k\geq |\alpha_n|$, then the graded multiplicity polynomial $m_{\alpha}(q)$ is given by
\[ m_{\alpha}(q)=\sum_{w\in S_n}\epsilon(w)\mathcal{P}_q(w(\alpha+\rho)-\rho). \]
Since $\lambda=\alpha+(k^n)$ it follows that
\[m_{\alpha}(q)=K_{\lambda (k^n)}(q).\]
For more on this result see \cite{Kostka-Foulkes:1} and \cite{Gupta:1}.


%The graded multiplicity polynomial $m_{\alpha}(q)$ has a similar formulation due to hesselink.... 
In Lie type A, the Kostka-Foulkes polynomials are completely understood from a combinatorial perspective. Lascoux and Schutzenberger \cite{Lascoux-Schutzenberger:1} showed that they can be expressed as
\[K_{\lambda\mu}(q)=\sum_{T\in SSYT(\lambda,\mu)}q^{c(T)}, \]
where the sum is taken over all semistandard Young tableaux of shape $\lambda$ and content $\mu$, and $c(T)$ is the \emph{charge statistic} of the tableau $T$ (see \cite{Macdonald:1}). Furthermore, the degree of this polynomial is given by $b(\mu)-b(\lambda)$.

In summary, the only irreducible rational representations $V^{\alpha}$ with highest weight $\alpha\in\mathbb{Z}^n$ for which $m_{\alpha}(q)\neq 0$ are those whose highest weight satisfies $\alpha_1+\cdots+\alpha_n=0$. If $m_{\alpha}(q)$ is nonzero, then we have
\[m_{\alpha}(q)=K_{\lambda(k^n)}(q),\]
where $k$ is any integer satisfying $k\geq|\alpha_n|$ and $\lambda=\alpha+(k^n)$. From the theorem of Lascoux and Schutzenberger, it follows that
\[ \text{deg }m_{\alpha}=b((k^n))-b(\lambda)=g_{nk,n}(\lambda). \]

% Section 4 - Final Thoughts

\section{Final thoughts}

This formulation of a discrete Gini index was motivated by recent research on the discrete Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) -- also known as the Wasserstein distance. Consider two different distributions of $s$ pebbles into $n$ distinct piles. Simply put, the one-dimensional EMD counts the least number of moves needed to convert the first distribution into the second, where each \emph{move} involves moving one pebble to a neighboring pile. An example of this procedure is provided in Figure \ref{figure3}.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=11cm]{EMD_picture.png}
    \caption{The minimum number of moves required to convert the top distribution, $(3,1,4,2)$, into the bottom distribution, $(2,3,4,1)$, is 3.}
    \label{figure3}
\end{figure}
The Gini index and EMD are both measures of dissimilarity and, in the discrete case, are in fact measuring the same quantity.

A composition of a positive integer $s$ into $n$ parts is an $n$-tuple of non-negative integers whose sum is $s$. The EMD of such compositions was discussed in \cite{Willenbring:1} (the one-dimensional case) and \cite{Erickson:2} (a higher dimensional generalization) -- generating functions and connections to representation theory were found in both instances. In \cite{Erickson:1} it was shown that if $\mu$ and $\lambda$ are compositions of $s$ into $n$ parts, then $EMD(\mu,\lambda)$ can be expressed as the symmetric difference of the Young diagrams of the words of $\mu$ and $\lambda$. The word of a composition $\mu$ is a tuple of integers constructed by writing $``0"$ $\mu_1$ times, then $``1"$ $\mu_2$ times, and so on, ending with $``n-1"$ written $\mu_{n}$ times. If $\mu$ is a composition of $s$ into $n$ parts, then the word of $\mu$ will be weakly increasing with length $s$. The Young diagram of a word is a collection of square boxes arranged in left-justified rows, whose ascending row lengths are given by the word. 

\begin{example}
\label{example3}
The EMD of the compositions $\mu=(3,1,4,2)$ and $\lambda=(2,3,4,1)$ can by found as in Figure \ref{figure3}, or by using Young diagrams as shown in \cite{Erickson:1}. The word of $\mu$ is $(0,0,0,1,2,2,2,2,3,3)$ and the word of $\lambda$ is $(0,0,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3)$. Their Young diagrams, and symmetric difference are shown in Figure~\ref{figure4}.

The symmetric difference of the diagrams is the number of boxes in their union minus their intersection. The number of shaded cells in the final diagram is the symmetric difference. Hence, for Example \ref{example3}, $EMD(\mu,\lambda)=3$.
\end{example}
The discrete Gini index can also be defined in terms of Young diagrams as in \cite{Kopitzke:1} and \cite{Kopitzke:2}, and from this interpretation if follows that
\[ EMD(\mu,\lambda)=b(\mu)-b(\lambda) \]
whenever $\mu$ and $\lambda$ are partitions of $s$ into $n$ parts, and $\mu$ majorizes $\lambda$ -- that is, whenever $\sum_{i=1}^k\mu_i \geq \sum_{i=1}^k\lambda_i$ for all $1\leq k \leq n$. In the special case where $s=nk$, it follows that
\[ EMD((k^n),\lambda)=b((k^n))-b(\lambda)=g_{nk,n}(\lambda). \]
That is, the discrete Gini index is a restriction of the discrete one-dimensional Earth Movers Distance to the set of partitions of $nk$ with at most $n$ parts.

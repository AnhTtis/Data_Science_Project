\section{Related Work}
Using SDP to verify programs is not new to the verification community.~\cite{semialgebraic-verify} applied SDP to verify the invariance and termination of semialgebraic programs.~\cite{sdp-prob} used SDP to verify the termination of probabilistic programs. From the verification point of view, our framework studies how to  abstract the neural-network properties into SDPs. In particular, we use symbolic domains and quadratic relations to achieve this abstraction. Meanwhile, semidefinite programming as a unique subject has also developed remarkably over the past decades. In particular, many SDP-based algorithms for intractable problems are believed optimal within polynomial time\cite{opt_inf2,ugc_cut,UGC_inf1_opt}. We provide a comprehensive discussion on many aspects of the SDP relaxation, which can in return bring more perspectives to other SDP-enabled verification works.

\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we present a new program reasoning framework for DNN verification. We have demonstrated its power on several network verification tasks, and also discussed many aspects of this paradigm. We believe that this framework can bring new representations and perspectives of the verification tasks and more tools to study them.

    "abstract": "The neural network has become an integral part of modern software systems. However, they still suffer from various problems, in particular, vulnerability to adversarial attacks. In this work, we present a novel program reasoning framework for neural-network verification, which we refer to as symbolic reasoning. The key components of our framework are the use of the symbolic domain and the quadratic relation. The symbolic domain has very flexible semantics, and the quadratic relation is quite expressive. They allow us to encode many verification problems for neural networks as quadratic programs. Our scheme then relaxes the quadratic programs to semidefinite programs, which can be efficiently solved. This framework allows us to verify various neural-network properties under different scenarios, especially those that appear challenging for non-symbolic domains. Moreover, it introduces new representations and perspectives for the verification tasks. We believe that our framework can bring new theoretical insights and practical tools to verification problems for neural networks.",

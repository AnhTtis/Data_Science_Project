\revised{\section{Field-of-View overlap}

We studied the relation among translation distance, rotation difference and the resulting FoV overlap measure. 
For that, we selected a subset of pairs of the MSLS training set and measured how the value of the FoV overlap varies with respect to the position and orientation difference of the image pairs. 

In Fig.~\ref{fig:supp_fov_tr}, we plot the relationship between the  translation distance and the value of the FoV overlap. We observed a somewhat linear relationship between increasing translation distance and decreasing FoV overlap. Moreover, many of the image pairs with FoV overlap of approximately 50\% were taken at a distance of about 25m. The variance that we observed in Fig.~\ref{fig:supp_fov_tr} can be attributed to the changes in orientation. Indeed, the relation between FoV overlap and orientation difference is less clear (see Fig.~\ref{fig:supp_fov_rot}). However, in general, the pairs with smaller orientation distance tend to have a higher FoV overlap. 

We plot the relation of the FoV overlap with both translation and orientation distance in a 3-dimensional plane in Fig.~\ref{fig:supp_fov_3d}, and as a heatmap in Fig.~\ref{fig:supp_fov_colormap}. 
Rotation and translation distance jointly influence the FoV overlap: the smaller the translation and orientation distance, the higher the similarity. Furthermore, as one of the distances has a higher value, the computer FoV overlap decreases, resulting in a lower annotated ground truth similarity.

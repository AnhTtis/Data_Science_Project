    "abstract": "Few-shot action recognition, i.e. recognizing new action classes given only a few examples, benefits from incorporating temporal information. Prior work either encodes such information in the representation itself and learns classifiers at test time, or obtains frame-level features and performs pairwise temporal matching. We first evaluate a number of matching-based approaches using features from spatio-temporal backbones, a comparison missing from the literature, and show that the gap in performance between simple baselines and more complicated methods is significantly reduced. Inspired by this, we propose Chamfer++, a non-temporal matching function that achieves state-of-the-art results in few-shot action recognition. We show that, when starting from temporal features, our parameter-free and interpretable approach can outperform all other matching-based and classifier methods for one-shot action recognition on three common datasets without using temporal information in the matching stage.

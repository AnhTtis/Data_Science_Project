\caption{\textbf{Matching a query video (middle) from “Picking something up” with two support videos of “Picking something up” (top) and two support videos of “Pulling something from left to right” (bottom)}. 
Each video consists of 8 clips with 16 frames each. We only show the first and last frames on top of each other in the figure (see project page for animated versions).
In grey, we draw the correspondences between the query and the support videos selected by Chamfer (query-based). In red, we draw the correspondence selected by max (single strongest correspondence). 
Line thickness corresponds to the pairwise similarity.

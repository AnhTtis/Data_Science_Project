\caption{\textbf{Few-shot action recognition results}. All methods are trained and evaluated by us and use the same R(2+1)D~\cite{r2plus1d} backbone. TSL~\cite{tsl} learns a classifier at each episode during testing. All the rest are pairwise matching-based methods and are split into two categories: non-temporal, \ie invariant to the temporal order of features, and temporal. $^\dagger$ denotes Chamfer++ matching using \textit{all} tuples.
Best (second-best) results are presented in \textbf{bold} (\underline{underlined}).

A number of recent few-shot learning papers are abandoning the meta-learning protocol for representation learning~\cite{wang2019simpleshot,Zhu2021CloserLook,chen2020closer,tsl} and show that adaptation from the best possible features leads to better performance. 
In the quest for rapid adaptation at test time, we also adopt this setup and show that, given strong visual representations, simple matching-based methods are really effective and able to beat both classifier-based and more complex matching-based approaches on many common benchmarks for few-shot action recognition.
We further show that temporal information in the matching provides no particular benefit compared to the ability to learn or adapt from strong temporal features, and introduce an intuitive matching-based method that is not only parameter-free but also easy to visualize and interpret.

    "abstract": "We define a family of discontinuous maps on the circle, called Bowen-Series-like maps, for geometric presentations of surface groups. The family has $2N$ parameters, where $2N$ is the number of generators of the presentation. We prove that all maps in the family have the same topological entropy, which coincides with the volume entropy of the group presentation. This approach allows a simple algorithmic computation of the volume entropy from the presentation only, using the Milnor-Thurston theory for one dimensional maps.",

\section{Conclusions \label{sec:conclusions}}

We presented a new Deliberation-JATD model, which incorporates unpaired text data in a deliberation model training jointly with acoustic (i.e. paired) data. The proposed method significantly outperforms both Deliberation and LAS-JATD models, reducing WER by up to 22.5\% relative to a regular deliberation model \cite{hu2020deliberation} on a rare word test set. Although the regular deliberation is improved by training from scratch using both paired and unpaired data, it still lags behind the Deliberation-JATD model by 12\% in terms of WER. The superior performance of Deliberation-JATD is achieved without additional inference complexity, mult-stage training, or performance degradation on Google Voice Search tasks.

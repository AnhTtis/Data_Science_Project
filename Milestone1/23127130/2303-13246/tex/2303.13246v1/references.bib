    abstract = { The two Riccati integral equations for linear-quadratic control problems involving evolution operators on Hilbert spaces are derived and shown to have a common solution, which yields the closed-loop structure of the optimal control. Riccati integral equations, instead of differential equations, arise because evolution operators are used to represent system dynamics. The operator representing the closed-loop control perturbs the evolution operator representing the uncontrolled system to produce a second evolution operator, representing the optimally controlled system, hence the two Riccati integral equations in terms of these two evolution operators, respectively.Having both Riccati integral equations facilitates the extension of the analysis of optimal control on finite time intervals to the analysis of optimal control on infinite time intervals, and then existence, uniqueness, and stability results for periodic solutions of the Riccati equations are obtained. Finally, sufficient conditions are given for convergence of approximate solutions of optimal control problems on both finite and infinite time intervals. }

Models of this kind have been recently proposed to study the behavior of large groups of animals, such as flocks of birds, swarms, or schools of fish. Our aim is to give a well-posedness theory for general models which possibly include a variety of effects: an interaction through a potential, such as a short-range repulsion and long-range attraction; a velocity-averaging effect where individuals try to adapt their own velocity to that of other individuals in their surroundings; and self-propulsion effects, which take into account effects on one individual that are independent of the others. We develop our theory in a space of measures, using mass transportation distances. As consequences of our theory, we show also the convergence of particle systems to their corresponding kinetic equations, and the local-in-time convergence to the hydrodynamic limit for one of the models. {\textcopyright} 2011 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

This framework is based on the Fokker-Planck equation that governs the time evolution of the PDF of stochastic processes and on tracking objectives of terminal configuration of the desired PDF. The corresponding optimization problems are formulated as a sequence of open-loop optimality systems in a receding-horizon control strategy. Many theoretical results concerning the forward and the optimal control problem are provided. In particular, it is shown that under appropriate assumptions the open-loop bilinear control function is unique. The resulting optimality system is discretized by the Chang-Cooper scheme that guarantees positivity of the forward solution. The effectiveness of the proposed computational framework is validated with a stochastic Lotka-Volterra model and a noised limit cycle model. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Modeling of crowd and pedestrian dynamics has intrigued engineers, physicists, and sociologists alike, even in recent times. Scientists have long sought to model the collective motion of large groups of individuals and study the mathematical basis of what seems to be apparently random behavior. A large number of macroscopic models have been proposed that describe crowd motion as a whole, much like the partial differential equations of fluid mechanics. This paper proposes a Lagrangian approach to the modeling of crowd dynamics by taking into consideration the various forces that act between the members of a crowd while they are in motion in a 2-D field. We attempt a realistic modeling of the attractive and repulsive forces between the members and seek to give a definite mathematical backbone to the terms 'panic' and 'evacuation.' That the dynamics is stable is demonstrated by constructing an appropriate Lyapunov energy function. We then linearize the dynamics to obtain mathematical expressions for the small perturbations about an equilibrium point. Through machine simulations and by tracking the motion of actual crowd systems, we show the validity of the mathematics of group formation and evacuation that we have proposed.},

For this kind of equations we find the equivalent partial differential equations in the initial domain and later we study some particular cases with and without diffusion. We also analyze general second order differential equations, not necessarily of balance type. The equations without diffusion are solved using the characteristics method. We also prove that the diffusion equations, endowed with Dirichlet boundary conditions and initial data, are well posed in the moving domain. For this we show that the principal part of the equivalent equation in the initial domain is uniformly elliptic. We then prove a version of the weak maximum principle for an equation in a moving domain. Finally we perform suitable energy estimates in the moving domain and give sufficient conditions for the solution to converge to zero as time goes to infinity.},

Mean-field models that consist of ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, and difference equations have been used in the swarm robotics literature, depending on whether the state of each agent and the time variable take values from a discrete or continuous set. These macroscopic models are independent of the number of agents in the swarm, and hence can be used to synthesize robot control strategies in a scalable manner, in contrast to individual-based microscopic models of swarms that represent finite numbers of discrete agents. Moreover, mean-field models are amenable to rigorous investigation using tools from dynamical systems theory, control theory, stochastic processes, and analysis of partial differential equations, enabling new insights and provable guarantees on the dynamics of collective behaviors. In this paper, we survey the applications of these models to problems in swarm robotics that include coverage, task allocation, self-assembly, consensus, and environmental mapping.},

The first approach to capture the global properties of such systems is to model them as graphs whose nodes represent the dynamical units, and whose links stand for the interactions between them. On the one hand, scientists have to cope with structural issues, such as characterizing the topology of a complex wiring architecture, revealing the unifying principles that are at the basis of real networks, and developing models to mimic the growth of a network and reproduce its structural properties. On the other hand, many relevant questions arise when studying complex networks' dynamics, such as learning how a large ensemble of dynamical systems that interact through a complex wiring topology can behave collectively. We review the major concepts and results recently achieved in the study of the structure and dynamics of complex networks, and summarize the relevant applications of these ideas in many different disciplines, ranging from nonlinear science to biology, from statistical mechanics to medicine and engineering. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

We, however, don't get any herding rate in this case.

abstract = {Many real-world processes can naturally be modeled as systems of interacting agents. However, the long-term simulation of such agent-based models is often intractable when the system becomes too large. In this paper, starting from a stochastic spatiotemporal agent-based model (ABM), we present a reduced model in terms of stochastic PDEs that describes the evolution of agent number densities for large populations while retaining the inherent model stochasticity. We discuss the algorithmic details of both approaches; regarding the SPDE model, we apply finite element discretization in space, which not only ensures efficient simulation but also serves as a regularization of the SPDE. Illustrative examples for the spreading of an innovation among agents are given and used for comparing ABM and SPDE models.},

abstract = {A single animal group can display different types of collective motion at different times. For a one-dimensional individual-based model of self-organizing group formation, we show that repeated switching between distinct ordered collective states can occur entirely because of stochastic effects. We introduce a framework for the coarse-grained, computer-assisted analysis of such stochasticity-induced switching in animal groups. This involves the characterization of the behavior of the system with a single dynamically meaningful "coarse observable" whose dynamics are described by an effective Fokker-Planck equation. A "lifting" procedure is presented, which enables efficient estimation of the necessary macroscopic quantities for this description through short bursts of appropriately initialized computations. This leads to the construction of an effective potential, which is used to locate metastable collective states, and their parametric dependence, as well as estimate mean switching times. {\textcopyright} 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {To achieve control objectives for extremely large-scale complex networks using standard methods is essentially intractable. In this article, a theory of the approximate control of complex network systems is proposed and developed by the use of graphon theory and the theory of infinite dimensional systems. First, graphon dynamical system models are formulated in an appropriate infinite dimensional space in order to represent arbitrary-size networks of linear dynamical systems, and to define the convergence of sequences of network systems with limits in the space. Exact controllability and approximate controllability of graphon dynamical systems are then investigated. Second, the minimum energy state-To-state control problem and the linear quadratic regulator problem for systems on complex networks are considered. The control problem for graphon limit systems is solved in each case and approximations are defined which yield control laws for the original control problems. Furthermore, convergence properties of the approximation schemes are established. A systematic control design methodology is developed within this framework. Finally, numerical examples of networks with randomly sampled weightings are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the graphon control methodology.},

Specifically, we highlight the primary characteristics of the motion of individual zebrafish (Danio rerio), and study how these can be suitably encapsulated within a mathematical framework utilising a limited number of calibrated model parameters. Using data captured from individual zebrafish via automated visual tracking, we develop a model using stochastic differential equations and describe fish as a self propelled particle moving in a plane. Based on recent experimental evidence of the importance of speed regulation in social behaviour, we extend stochastic models of fish locomotion by introducing experimentally-derived processes describing dynamic speed regulation. Salient metrics are defined which are then used to calibrate key parameters of coupled stochastic differential equations, describing both speed and angular speed of swimming fish. The effects of external constraints are also included, based on experimentally observed responses. Understanding the spontaneous dynamics of zebrafish using a bottom-up, purely data-driven approach is expected to yield a modelling framework for quantitative investigation of individual behaviour in the presence of various external constraints or biological assays.},

abstract = {A computer simulation was performed to examine the schooling mechanism. The model uses the basic assumptions that the speed and direction of individual movements are stochastic variables, and that the direction of movement is related to the location and heading of the neighbors. Three behavioral interactions between individuals were considered; approach, avoidance, and parallel orientation movements. Individual movements and the resultant group movement were simulated by repeatedly generating random numbers. It was found that group movements in unity could occur despite each individual lacking knowledge of movement of the entire school, and in the absence of a consistent leader. The results lead to the following conclusions: for effective schooling to occur, individuals must possess two types of behavior; 1. approach movement to allow aggregation, and 2. parallel orientation movement to allow the group to move cohesively. Experiments were also performed with varied combinations of model parameters, and a wide variation in the movement pattern of the simulated school was obtained. {\textcopyright} 1982, The Japanese Society of Fisheries Science.

Sufficient pinning controllability conditions are derived depending on the node dynamics, network structure, noise intensity, and control parameters. Counterintuitively, it is found that under some specific conditions noise may enhance the pinning controllability of the network making it easier to drive all agents toward the desired collective behavior. The effectiveness of the theoretical results is illustrated via two application examples arising in the context of gene regulatory networks and synchronization of chaotic systems.},

Subsequently, using the validated microscopic models as our template, abstraction is raised to the level of macroscopic difference equations.

abstract = {In contrast to bird flocks, fish schools and animal herds, midge swarms maintain cohesion but do not possess global order. High-speed imaging techniques are now revealing that these swarms have surprising properties. Here, I show that simple models found on the Langevin equation are consistent with this wealth of recent observations. The models predict correctly that large accelerations, exceeding 10 g, will be common and they predict correctly the coexistence of core condensed phases surrounded by dilute vapour phases. The models also provide new insights into the influence of environmental conditions on swarm dynamics. They predict that correlations between midges increase the strength of the effective force binding the swarm together. This may explain why such correlations are absent in laboratory swarms but present in natural swarms which contend with the wind and other disturbances. Finally, the models predict that swarms have fluid-like macroscopic mechanical properties and will slosh rather than slide back and forth after being abruptly displaced. This prediction offers a promising avenue for future experimentation that goes beyond current quasi-static testing which has revealed solid-like responses.},

For such a potential, various explicit calculations can be carried out in detail. In one dimension we fully solve the temporal dynamics, and in two or higher dimensions we show the global stability of this steady state within the class of radially symmetric solutions. Finally, we solve the following restricted inverse problem: given a radially symmetric density that is zero outside some ball of radius R and is polynomial inside the ball, construct an interaction potential K for which is the steady-state solution of the corresponding aggregation equation.

abstract = {In this article, we introduce a model and a control approach for herding a swarm of 'follower' agents to a target distribution among a set of states using a single 'leader' agent. The follower agents evolve on a finite state space that is represented by a graph and transition between states according to a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC), whose transition rates are determined by the location of the leader agent. The control problem is to define a sequence of states for the leader agent that steers the probability density of the forward equation of the Markov chain. For the case, when the followers are possibly interacting, we prove local approximate controllability of the system about equilibrium probability distributions. For the case, when the followers are noninteracting, we design two switching control laws for the leader that drive the swarm of follower agents asymptotically to a target probability distribution that is positive for all states. The first strategy is open-loop in nature, and the switching times of the leader are independent of the follower distribution. The second strategy is of feedback type, and the switching times of the leader are functions of the follower density in the leader's current state. We validate our control approach through numerical simulations with varied numbers of follower agents that evolve on graphs of different sizes, through a 3-D multirobot simulation in which a quadrotor is used to control the spatial distribution of eight ground robots over four regions, and through a physical experiment in which a swarm of ten robots is herded by a virtual leader over four regions.},

abstract = {This paper presents a method to control the probability density distribution of a swarm of vehicles via velocity fields. The proposed approach synthesizes smooth velocity fields, which specify a desired velocity as a function of time and position in a decentralized manner i.e., each agent calculates the desired velocity locally by utilizing the number of agents within a prescribed communication distance. Swarm converges to the desired/commanded density distribution by following the velocity field. The local information consists, only, of agents' positions and it is utilized to estimate the density around each agent. Local density estimation is performed by using kernel density estimation. Then the local density estimates and the desired density are utilized to generate the velocity field, which propagates the swarm probability density distribution via the well-known heat equation. The key advantage of using smooth velocity fields to control swarm density with respect to our earlier Markov chain based probabilistic control methods is that the agents move more smoothly in an organized manner and their relative velocities go to zero as they get closer to each other, i.e., they facilitate conict/collision avoidance. The desired density distribution, which is commanded to the local controllers, can be computed by using a Markov chain that propagates the desired density distribution within prescribed requirements. Along with convergence and stability analysis, the effectiveness of the approach is illustrated via numerical examples.},

We solve the problem of cooperative plume tracking using two cooperating robots under formation control, one is assigned as the sensing robot and the other is assigned as the tracking robot, where the sensing robot estimates the gradient and divergence information of the entire field based on its current concentration measurement, and the tracking robot tracks the plume front and patrols on it. Rigorous convergence analysis is provided using the set stability concept. Numerical simulations of pollutant plume tracking in both two- and three-dimensional spaces demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme. This paper extends existing literature from static-level curve tracking to dynamic plume front tracking and presents a PDE-observer-based plume front tracking control design. The results are applicable to emerging environmental monitoring tasks by cooperative robots.},

Mean-field models that consist of ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, and difference equations have been used in the swarm robotics literature, depending on whether the state of each agent and the time variable take values from a discrete or continuous set. These macroscopic models are independent of the number of agents in the swarm, and hence can be used to synthesize robot control strategies in a scalable manner, in contrast to individual-based microscopic models of swarms that represent finite numbers of discrete agents. Moreover, mean-field models are amenable to rigorous investigation using tools from dynamical systems theory, control theory, stochastic processes, and analysis of partial differential equations, enabling new insights and provable guarantees on the dynamics of collective behaviors. In this paper, we survey the applications of these models to problems in swarm robotics that include coverage, task allocation, self-assembly, consensus, and environmental mapping.},

abstract = {In this work we derive and analyse coarse-grained descriptions of self-propelled particles with selective attraction-repulsion interaction, where individuals may respond differently to their neighbours depending on their relative state of motion (approach versus movement away). Based on the formulation of a nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation, we derive a kinetic description of the system dynamics in terms of equations for the Fourier modes of the one-particle density function. This approach allows effective numerical investigation of the stability of solutions of the nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation. Further on, we also derive a hydrodynamic theory by performing a closure at the level of the second Fourier mode of the one-particle density function. We show that the general form of equations is in agreement with the theory formulated by Toner and Tu. The stability of spatially homogeneous solutions is analysed and the range of validity of the hydrodynamic equations is quantified. Finally, we compare our analytical predictions on the stability of the homogeneous solutions with results of individual-based simulations. They show good agreement for sufficiently large densities and non-negligible short-ranged repulsion. The results of the kinetic theory for weak short-ranged repulsion reveal the existence of a previously unknown phase of the model consisting of dense, nematically aligned filaments, which cannot be accounted for by the present hydrodynamics theory of the Toner and Tu type for polar active matter. {\textcopyright} IOP Publishing and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.},

Its unit are mass per unit volume. Water has a density of about 1 gram per cubic centimeter. For air the density is about 10 −3 grams per cubic centimeter, but of course pressure and temperature affect air density significantly. The air in a room of a thousand cubic meters= 10 9 cubic centimeters weighs about a thousand kilograms, or more than a ton! 2.1.1 Eulerian form Let us suppose that mass is being added or subtracted from space as a function q(x, t), of dimensions mass per unit volume per unit time. The conservation of mass in a fixed region R can be expressed using (1.20) with f = $\rho$: d dt R $\rho$dV x = R ∂$\rho$ ∂t dV x + ∂R $\rho$u {\textperiodcentered} ndS x . (2.1) Now d dt R $\rho$dV x = R qdV x (2.2) and if we bring the surface integral in (2.1) back into the volume integral using the divergence theorem we arrive at R ∂$\rho$ ∂t + div(u$\rho$) − q dV x = 0. (2.3) Since our functions are continuous and R is an arbitrary open set in R N , the integrand in (2.3) must vanish, yielding the conservation of mass equation in 15 16 CHAPTER 2. CONSERVATION OF MASS AND MOMENTUM the Eulerian form: ∂$\rho$ ∂t + div(u$\rho$) = q. (2.4) Note that this last equation can also be written D$\rho$ Dt + $\rho$div u = q. (2.5) The conservation of mass equation in either of these forms is sometimes called (for obscure reasons) the equation of continuity. The form (2.5) shows that the material derivative of the density changes in two ways, either by sources and sinks of mass q {\textgreater} 0 or q {\textless} 0 respectively, or else by the non-vanishing of the divergence of the velocity field. A positive value of the divergence, as for u = (x, y, z), is associated with an expansive flow, thereby reducing local density. This can be examined more closely as follows. Let V be a small volume of fluid where the density is essentially constant. Then $\rho$V is the mass within this fluid parcel, which is a material invariant D($\rho$V)/Dt = 0. Thus D$\rho$/Dt + $\rho$V −1 DV /Dt = 0. Comparing this with (2.5) we have div u = 1 V},

From early work on insects to recent endeavors on mammals, we have witnessed fascinating applications that have pushed forward our understanding of animal behavior along new directions. Despite significant progress, most of the research has focused on open-loop control systems, in which robots execute predetermined actions, independent of the animal behavior. In this article, we integrate mathematical modeling of social behavior toward the design of realistic feedback laws for robots to interact with a live animal. In particular, we leverage recent advancements in data-driven modeling of zebrafish behavior. Ultimately, we establish a novel robotic platform that allows real-time actuation of a biologically-inspired three-dimensionally printed zebrafish replica to implement model-based control of animal behavior. We demonstrate our approach through a series of experiments, designed to elucidate the appraisal of the replica by live subjects with respect to conspecifics and to quantify the biological value of closed-loop control.},

Assuming that the network remodeling process is very fast, the macroscopic model takes the form of a single aggregation–diffusion equation for the density of particles. The theoretical study of the macroscopic model gives precise criteria for the phase transitions of the steady states, and in the one-dimensional case, we show numerically that the stationary solutions of the microscopic model undergo the same phase transitions and bifurcation types as the macroscopic model. In the two-dimensional case, we show that the numerical simulations of the macroscopic model are in excellent agreement with the predicted theoretical values. This study provides a partial validation of the formal derivation of the macroscopic model from a microscopic formulation and shows that the former is a consistent approximation of an underlying particle dynamics, making it a powerful tool for the modeling of dynamical networks at a large scale.},

abstract = {Designing and analyzing self-organizing systems such as robotic swarms is a challenging task even though we have complete knowledge about the robot's interior. It is difficult to determine the individual robot's behavior based on the swarm behavior and vice versa due to the high number of agent-agent interactions. A step towards a solution of this problem is the development of appropriate models which accurately predict the swarm behavior based on a specified control algorithm. Such models would reduce the necessary number of time-consuming simulations and experiments during the design process of an algorithm. In this paper we propose a model with focus on an explicit representation of space because the effectiveness of many swarm robotic scenarios depends on spatial inhomogeneity. We use methods of statistical physics to address spatiality. Starting from a description of a single robot we derive an abstract model of swarm motion. The model is then extended to a generic model framework of communicating robots. In two examples we validate models against simulation results. Our experience shows that qualitative correctness is easily achieved, while quantitative correctness is disproportionately more difficult but still possible. {\textcopyright} Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2008.},

With the integral transformation and boundary feedback the unstable PDE is converted into a "delay line" system which converges to zero in finite time. We then apply this procedure to finite-dimensional systems with actuator and sensor delays to recover a well-known infinite-dimensional controller (analog of the Smith predictor for unstable plants). We also show that the proposed method can be used for the boundary control of a Korteweg-de Vries-like third-order PDE.

abstract = {In this paper, a new framework for evolution of multi agent systems (MAS) based on principles of continuum mechanics is developed. Agents are treated as mass particles of a continuum whose evolution (both translation and deformation) is modeled as a homeomorphism from a reference to the current configuration. Such a mapping assures that no two mass particles of the continuum occupy the same location at any given time, thus guaranteeing that inter-agent collision is avoided during motion. We show that a special class of mappings whose Jacobian is only time varying and not spatially varying has some desirable properties that are advantageous in studying swarms. Two specific scenarios are studied where the evolution of a swarm from one configuration to another occurs with no inter-agent collisions while avoiding obstacles, under (i) zero inter-agent communication and (ii) local inter-agent communication. In the first case, a desired map is computed by each agent all knowing the positions of a few leader agents in a reference and the desired configurations. In the second case, paths of n+1 leader agents evolving in an n-D space are known only to the leaders, while positions of follower agents evolve through updates that are based on positions of n+1 adjacent agent through local communication with them. The latter is based on a set of weights of communication of follower agents that are predicated on certain distance ratios assigned on the basis of the initial formation of the MAS. Properties of homogeneous maps are exploited to characterize the necessary communication protocol. {\textcopyright} 2014 by ASME.},

In this paper, we address the problem of distributed optimal transport, with the aim of minimizing the cost of deployment of large swarms. Working with a macroscopic PDE model of swarms given by the continuity equation, we first formulate a general deployment objective, and formulate deployment algorithms as convergent gradient flows. Then, we design and analyze a novel Laplacian-based distributed algorithm and a corresponding weighted gradient flow for optimal transport. We conclude the manuscript with simulations that illustrate our results.},

abstract = {Among the most striking aspects of the movement of many animal groups are their sudden coherent changes in direction. Recent observations of locusts and starlings have shown that this directional switching is an intrinsic property of their motion. Similar direction switches are seen in self-propelled particle and other models of group motion. Comprehending the factors that determine such switches is key to understanding the movement of these groups. Here, we adopt a coarse-grained approach to the study of directional switching in a self-propelled particle model assuming an underlying one-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation for the mean velocity of the particles. We continue with this assumption in analyzing experimental data on locusts and use a similar systematic Fokker-Planck equation coefficient estimation approach to extract the relevant information for the assumed Fokker-Planck equation underlying that experimental data. In the experiment itself the motion of groups of 5 to 100 locust nymphs was investigated in a homogeneous laboratory environment, helping us to establish the intrinsic dynamics of locust marching bands. We determine the mean time between direction switches as a function of group density for the experimental data and the self-propelled particle model. This systematic approach allows us to identify key differences between the experimental data and the model, revealing that individual locusts appear to increase the randomness of their movements in response to a loss of alignment by the group. We giveaquantitative descriptionofhow locusts use noisetomaintain swarm alignment. We discuss further how properties of individual animal behavior, inferred by using the Fokker-Planck equation coefficient estimation approach, can be implemented in the selfpropelled particle model to replicate qualitatively the group level dynamics seen in the experimental data.},

Mathematical models of zebrafish behaviour can inform the design of experiments, through the unprecedented ability to perform pilot trials on a computer. At the same time, in-silico experiments could help refining the analysis of real data, by enabling the systematic investigation of key neurobehavioural factors. Here, we establish a data-driven model of zebrafish social interaction. Specifically, we derive a set of interaction rules to capture the primary response mechanisms which have been observed experimentally. Contrary to previous studies, we include dynamic speed regulation in addition to turning responses, which together provide attractive, repulsive and alignment interactions between individuals. The resulting multi-agent model provides a novel, bottom-up framework to describe both the spontaneous motion and individual-level interaction dynamics of zebrafish, inferred directly from experimental observations.},

We model the ensemble population dynamics as an advection–diffusion–reaction PDE model and formulate the mapping and coverage tasks as identification and control problems for this model. In the mapping task, robots are deployed over a closed domain to gather data, which is unlocalized and independent of robot identities, for reconstructing the unknown spatial distribution of a region of interest. We frame this task as a convex optimization problem whose solution represents the region as a spatially-dependent coefficient in the PDE model. We then consider a coverage problem in which the robots must perform a desired activity at a programmable probability rate to achieve a target spatial distribution of activity over the reconstructed region of interest. We formulate this task as an optimal control problem in which the PDE model is expressed as a bilinear control system, with the robots' coverage activity rate and velocity field defined as the control inputs. We validate our approach with simulations of a combined mapping and coverage scenario in two environments with three target coverage distributions.},

Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon13'14 (popularly known as six degrees of separation15). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

The difference operator makes analysis difficult due to its non-local form. Approximate equations can be gained by replacing the difference operators via a local derivative operator. Although the application of a model with derivative of more than second order improves the continuous model, a higher order of approximated differential equation seriously complicates a solution to the stated problem.

abstract = {A class of quasilinear stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs), driven by spatially correlated Brownian noise, is shown to become macroscopic (i.e., deterministic), as the length of the correlations tends to 0. The limit is the solution of a quasilinear partial differential equation. The quasilinear SPDEs are obtained as a continuum limit from the empirical distribution of a large number of stochastic ordinary differential equations (SODEs), coupled though a mean-field interaction and driven by correlated Brownian noise. The limit theorems are obtained by application of a general result on the convergence of exchangeable systems of processes. We also compare our approach to SODEs with the one introduced by Kunita. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2008.},

abstract = {Well-quantified laboratory studies can provide a fundamental understanding of animal behavior in ecology, ethology and ecotoxicology research. These types of studies require observation and tracking of each animal in well-controlled and defined arenas, often for long timescales. Thus, these experiments produce long time series and a vast amount of data that require the use of software applications to automate the analysis and reduce manual annotation. In this review, we examine 28 free software applications for animal tracking to guide researchers in selecting the software that might best suit a particular experiment. We also review the algorithms in the tracking pipeline of the applications, explain how specific techniques can fit different experiments, and finally, expose each approach's weaknesses and strengths. Our in-depth review includes last update, type of platform, user-friendliness, off- or online video acquisition, calibration method, background subtraction and segmentation method, species, multiple arenas, multiple animals, identity preservation, manual identity correction, data analysis and extra features. We found, for example, that out of 28 programs, only 3 include a calibration algorithm to reduce image distortion and perspective problems that affect accuracy and can result in substantial errors when analyzing trajectories and extracting mobility or explored distance. In addition, only 4 programs can directly export in-depth tracking and analysis metrics, only 5 are suited for tracking multiple unmarked animals for more than a few seconds and only 11 have been updated in the period 2019–2021.},

In addition, we establish the existence of a unique continuously differentiable entropy functional for all equilibrium and non-equilibrium states of our thermodynamically consistent dynamical system. Information consensus and semistability are shown using the well-known Sobolev embedding theorems and the notion of generalized (or weak) solutions.

abstract = {The notion of a finite dipoleis introduced as a pair of equal and opposite strength point vortices (i.e. a vortex dipole) separated by a finite distance. Equations of motion for N finite dipoles interacting in an unbounded inviscid fluid are derived from the modified interaction of 2 N independent vortices subject to the constraint that the inter-vortex spacing of each constrained dipole, ℓ, remains constant. In the absence of all other dipoles and background flow, a single dipole moves in a straight line along the perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining the two point vortices comprising the dipole, with a self-induced velocity inversely proportional to ℓ. When more than one dipole is present, the velocity of the dipole centre is the sum of the self-induced velocity and the average of the induced velocities on each vortex comprising the pair due to all the other dipoles. Each dipole orients in the direction of shear gradient based on the difference in velocities on each of the two vortices in the pair. Several numerical experiments are shown to illustrate the interactions between two and three dipoles in abreast and tandem configurations. We also show that equilibria (multi-poles) can form as a result of the interactions, and we study the stability of polygonal equilibria, showing that the N = 3 case is linearly stable, whereas the N {\textgreater} 3 case is linearly unstable. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Royal Society.},

In particular, the effects of the optimal actuator location for one networked system can impact the collective behavior of the networked systems. The actuator optimization cannot be performed on the individual networked systems, but must be considered for the aggregate of the networked systems. To tackle the actuator optimization problem, the networked systems are viewed collectively and with the implementation of a synchronization controller, the resulting closed-loop aggregate system is parameterized by the actuator location. Using different metrics for the success of synchronization, the resulting actuator optimization problem is recast as a minimization of a performance index. The solution to this optimization is expressed as the minimization of the trace of a location-parameterized Lyapunov operator. Simulation studies on seven networked diffusion partial differential equations in one spatial dimension reveal the effects of a correct actuator placement on synchronization.},

abstract = {This paper explores a stochastic approach for controlling swarms of independent robots toward a target distribution in a bounded domain. The robot swarm has no central controller, and individual robots lack both communication and localization capabilities. Robots can only measure a scalar field (e.g. concentration of a chemical) from the environment and from this deduce the desired local swarm density. Based on this value, each robot follows a simple control law that causes the swarm as a whole to diffuse toward the target distribution. Using a new holonomic drive robot, we present the first confirmation of this control law with physical experiment. Despite deviations from assumptions underpinning the theory, the swarm achieves the theorized convergence to the target distribution in both simulation and experiment. In fact, simulated and experimental performance agree with one another and with our hypothesis that the error from the target distribution is inversely proportional to the square root of the number of robots. This is evidence that the algorithm is both practical and easily scalable to large swarms.},

We study the optimization problem and, based on the gained insights, we derive an algorithm allowing to find an approximate solution. We also show that, if the initial network is a flow network, it is possible to design the algorithm such that the output remains a flow network. Experimental results are then presented to optimally choose the parameters of the algorithm suggesting that, by tuning a parameter, it is possible to speed up the algorithm with a comparable efficiency.

abstract = {We introduce the concept of mean-field optimal control which is the rigorous limit process connecting finite dimensional optimal control problems with ODE constraints modeling multi-agent interactions to an infinite dimensional optimal control problem with a constraint given by a PDE of Vlasov-type, governing the dynamics of the probability distribution of interacting agents. While in the classical mean-field theory one studies the behavior of a large number of small individuals freely interacting with each other, by simplifying the effect of all the other individuals on any given individual by a single averaged effect, we address the situation where the individuals are actually influenced also by an external policy maker, and we propagate its effect for the number N of individuals going to infinity. On the one hand, from a modeling point of view, we take into account also that the policy maker is constrained to act according to optimal strategies promoting its most parsimonious interaction with the group of individuals. This will be realized by considering cost functionals including L{\textless}sup{\textgreater}1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}-norm terms penalizing a broadly distributed control of the group, while promoting its sparsity. On the other hand, from the analysis point of view, and for the sake of generality, we consider broader classes of convex control penalizations. In order to develop this new concept of limit rigorously, we need to carefully combine the classical concept of mean-field limit, connecting the finite dimensional system of ODE describing the dynamics of each individual of the group to the PDE describing the dynamics of the respective probability distribution, with the well-known concept of $\Gamma$-convergence to show that optimal strategies for the finite dimensional problems converge to optimal strategies of the infinite dimensional problem.},

We illustrate the macroscopic modelling methods with the help of a few sample results gathered in distributed manipulation experiments (collaborative stick pulling, foraging, aggregation).

abstract = {Objectives. To understand how Twitter bots and trolls (“bots”) promote online health content. Methods. We compared bots' to average users' rates of vaccine-relevant messages, which we collected online from July 2014 through September 2017. We estimated the likelihood that users were bots, comparing proportions of polarized and antivaccine tweets across user types. We conducted a content analysis of a Twitter hashtag associated with Russian troll activity. Results. Compared with average users, Russian trolls (c2(1) = 102.0; P {\textless} .001), sophisticated bots (c2(1) = 28.6; P {\textless} .001), and “content polluters” (c2(1) = 7.0; P {\textless} .001) tweeted about vaccination at higher rates. Whereas content polluters posted more antivaccine content (c2(1) = 11.18; P {\textless} .001), Russian trolls amplified both sides. Unidentifiable accounts were more polarized (c2(1) = 12.1; P {\textless} .001) and antivaccine (c2(1) = 35.9; P {\textless} .001). Analysis of the Russian troll hashtag showed that its messages were more political and divisive. Conclusions. Whereas bots that spread malware and unsolicited content disseminated antivaccine messages, Russian trolls promoted discord. Accounts masquerading as legitimate users create false equivalency, eroding public consensus on vaccination. Public Health Implications. Directly confronting vaccine skeptics enables bots to legitimize the vaccine debate. More research is needed to determine how best to combat bot-driven content.},

@article{Sarlette2009,
abstract = {Several recent control applications consider the coordination of subsystems through local interaction. Often the interaction has a symmetry in state space, e.g. invariance with respect to a uniform translation of all subsystem values. The present paper shows that in presence of such symmetry, fundamental properties can be highlighted by viewing the distributed system as the discrete approximation of a partial differential equation. An important fact is that the symmetry on the state space differs from the popular spatial invariance property, which is not necessary for the present results. The relevance of the viewpoint is illustrated on two examples: (i) ill-conditioning of interaction matrices in coordination/consensus problems and (ii) the string instability issue. {\textcopyright}2009 IEEE.},

Precisely, the empirical distributions of near-optimal control-state pairs for the n-state systems, as n tends to infinity, admit limit points in distribution (if the objective functions are suitably coercive), and every such limit is supported on the set of optimal control-state pairs for the McKean-Vlasov problem. Conversely, any distribution on the set of optimal control-state pairs for the McKean-Vlasov problem can be realized as a limit in this manner. Arguments are based on controlled martingale problems, which lend themselves naturally to existence proofs; along the way it is shown that a large class of McKean-Vlasov control problems admit optimal Markovian controls.},

@article{Kenett2015,
abstract = {Abstract This is an introduction to the special issue titled "Networks of networks" that is in the making at Chaos, Solitons {\&} Fractals. Recent research and reviews attest to the fact that networks of networks are the next frontier in network science [1-7]. Not only are interactions limited and thus inadequately described by well-mixed models, it is also a fact that the networks that should be an integral part of such models are often interconnected, thus making the processes that are unfolding on them interdependent. From the World economy and transportation systems to social media, it is clear that processes taking place in one network might significantly affect what is happening in many other networks. Within an interdependent system, each type of interaction has a certain relevance and meaning, so that treating all the links identically inevitably leads to information loss. Networks of networks, interdependent networks, or multilayer networks are therefore a much better and realistic description of such systems, and this Special Issue is devoted to their structure, dynamics and evolution, as well as to the study of emergent properties in multi-layered systems in general. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the spread of epidemics and information, percolation, diffusion, synchronization, collective behavior, and evolutionary games on networks of networks. Interdisciplinary work on all aspects of networks of networks, regardless of background and motivation, is very welcome.},

abstract = {Upstream migration of fish schools in 1-D rivers as an optimal control problem is formulated where their swimming velocity and the horizontal oblateness are taken as control variables. The objective function to be maximized through a migration process consists of the biological and ecological profit to be gained at the upstream-end of a river, energetic cost of swimming against the flow, and conceptual cost of forming a school. Under simplified conditions where the flow is uniform in both space and time and the profit to be gained at the goal of migration is sufficiently large, the optimal control variables are determined from a system of algebraic equations that can be solved in a cascading manner. Mathematical analysis of the system reveals that the optimal controls are uniquely found and the model is exactly solvable under certain conditions on the functions and parameters, which turn out to be realistic and actually satisfied in experimental fish migration. Identification results of the functional shapes of the functions and the parameters with experimentally observed data of swimming schools of Plecoglossus altivelis (Ayu) validate the present mathematical model from both qualitative and quantitative viewpoints. The present model thus turns out to be consistent with the reality, showing its potential applicability to assessing fish migration in applications.},

abstract = {In this survey we consider mathematical models and methods recently developed to control crowd dynamics, with particular emphasis on egressing pedestrians. We focus on two control strategies: the first one consists in using special agents, called leaders, to steer the crowd towards the desired direction. Leaders can be either hidden in the crowd or recognizable as such. This strategy heavily relies on the power of the social influence (herding effect), namely the natural tendency of people to follow group mates in situations of emergency or doubt. The second one consists in modify the surrounding environment by adding in the walking area multiple obstacles optimally placed and shaped. The aim of the obstacles is to naturally force people to behave as desired. Both control strategies discussed in this paper aim at reducing as much as possible the intervention on the crowd. Ideally the natural behavior of people is kept, and people do not even realize they are being led by an external intelligence. Mathematical models are discussed at different scales of observation, showing how macroscopic (fluid-dynamic) models can be derived by mesoscopic (kinetic) models which, in turn, can be derived by microscopic (agent-based) models.},

abstract = {In this paper, we consider stochastic coverage of bounded domains by a diffusing swarm of robots that take local measurements of an underlying scalar field. We introduce three control methodologies with diffusion, advection, and reaction as independent control inputs. We analyze the diffusion-based control strategy using standard operator semigroup-theoretic arguments. We show that the diffusion coefficient can be chosen to be dependent only on the robots' local measurements to ensure that the swarm density converges to a function proportional to the scalar field. The boundedness of the domain precludes the need to impose assumptions on decaying properties of the scalar field at infinity. Moreover, exponential convergence of the swarm density to the equilibrium follows from properties of the spectrum of the semigroup generator. In addition, we use the proposed coverage method to construct a time-inhomogenous diffusion process and apply the observability of the heat equation to reconstruct the scalar field over the entire domain from observations of the robots' random motion over a small subset of the domain. We verify our results through simulations of the coverage scenario on a 2D domain and the field estimation scenario on a 1D domain.},

We first make a summary of the kinetic models derived as continuum versions of second order models for swarming. We focus on the question of passing from the discrete to the continuum model in the Dobrushin framework. We show how to use related techniques from fluid mechanics equations applied to first order models for swarming, also called the aggregation equation. We give qualitative bounds on the approximation of initial data by particles to obtain the mean-field limit for radial singular (at the origin) potentials up to the Newtonian singularity.

In this paper, we analyze the literature from the point of view of swarm engineering: we focus mainly on ideas and concepts that contribute to the advancement of swarm robotics as an engineering field and that could be relevant to tackle real-world applications. Swarm engineering is an emerging discipline that aims at defining systematic and well founded procedures for modeling, designing, realizing, verifying, validating, operating, and maintaining a swarm robotics system. We propose two taxonomies: in the first taxonomy, we classify works that deal with design and analysis methods; in the second taxonomy, we classify works according to the collective behavior studied.

abstract = {Large networks of interacting dynamical systems are well-known for the complex behaviours they are able to display, even when each node features a quite simple dynamics. Despite examples of such networks being widespread both in nature and in technological applications, the interplay between the local and the macroscopic behaviour, through the interconnection topology, is still not completely understood. Moreover, traditional analytical methods for dynamical response analysis fail because of the intrinsically large dimension of the phase space of the network which makes the general problem intractable. Therefore, in this paper we develop an approach aiming to condense all the information in a compact description based on partial differential equations. By focusing on propagative phenomena, rigorous conditions under which the original network dynamical properties can be successfully analysed within the proposed framework are derived as well. A network of Fitzhugh-Nagumo systems is finally used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

In this paper, we provide a flexible machine learning framework for the numerical solution of potential MFG and MFC models. State-of-the-art numerical methods for solving such problems utilize spatial discretization that leads to a curse of dimensionality. We approximately solve high-dimensional problems by combining Lagrangian and Eulerian viewpoints and leveraging recent advances from machine learning. More precisely, we work with a Lagrangian formulation of the problem and enforce the underlying Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation that is derived from the Eulerian formulation. Finally, a tailored neural network parameterization of the MFG/MFC solution helps us avoid any spatial discretization. Our numerical results include the approximate solution of 100-dimensional instances of optimal transport and crowd motion problems on a standard work station and a validation using a Eulerian solver in two dimensions. These results open the door to much-anticipated applications of MFG and MFC models that are beyond reach with existing numerical methods.},

Treating the agents as a continuum, the agents' collective dynamics are modeled by a complex-valued partial differential equation (PDE). The states of PDE is the position of the agents, namely, the real part is axis-x and the image part is axis-y. We prove via PDE analysis that the tracking errors between the desired trajectory and the actual one are bounded on the condition of bounded velocity of the reference orbit. By discretization of the PDE, a simple leader-follower distributed control law is obtained, in which only neighbor-range relative positions are needed for the follower agents to track and keep formation. One can apply low-cost follower with limited sensing range into practise since the H1 norm bounded ensures the neighbors in communication graph is also the neighbors in physical distance. Various simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively achieve the formation tracking objective with small error.},

abstract = {We consider stochastic dynamic games in large population conditions where multiclass agents are weakly coupled via their individual dynamics and costs. We approach this large population game problem by the so-called Nash Certainty Equivalence (NCE) Principle which leads to a decentralized control synthesis. The McKean-Vlasov NCE method presented in this paper has a close connection with the statistical physics of large particle systems: both identify a consistency relationship between the individual agent (or particle) at the microscopic level and the mass of individuals (or particles) at the macroscopic level. The overall game is decomposed into (i) an optimal control problem whose Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation determines the optimal control for each individual and which involves a measure corresponding to the mass effect, and (ii) a family of McKean-Vlasov (M-V) equations which also depend upon this measure. We designate the NCE Principle as the property that the resulting scheme is consistent (or soluble), i.e. the prescribed control laws produce sample paths which produce the mass effect measure. By construction, the overall closed-loop behaviour is such that each agent's behaviour is optimal with respect to all other agents in the game theoretic Nash sense.},

Collective decision-making is determined by information exchange among neighbours. Neighbourhoods are specified using the perceptual limit and numerosity of fish. Fish self-propulsion and obedience to group decisions are described through random variables. Spatio-temporal schooling patterns are measured using coarse observables adapted from the literature on coupled oscillator networks and features of the time-varying network describing the fish-to-fish information exchange. Experiments on zebrafish schooling in an annular tank are used to validate the model. Effects of group size and obedience parameter on coarse observables and network features are explored to understand the implications of perceptual numerosity and spatial density on fish schooling. The proposed model is also compared with a more traditional metric model, in which the numerosity constraint is released and fish interactions depend only on physical configurations. Comparison shows that the topological regime on which the proposed model is constructed allows for interpreting characteristic behaviours observed in the experimental study that are not captured by the metric model. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Royal Society.},

The necessary theory and its validation on a mobile-agent-based swarm test bed are considered for two primary tasks: homogeneous transformation of the MAS and deployment of a random distribution of agents on a desired configuration. The framework for this model is based on homogeneous transformations for the evolution of an MAS under no inter-agent communication, local inter-agent communication, and intelligent perception by agents. Different communication protocols for MAS evolution, the robustness of tracking of a desired motion by an MAS evolving in Rn, and the effect of communication delays in an MAS evolving under consensus algorithms or homogeneous maps are also explored. Featuring appendices which introduce the requisite concepts from continuum kinematics and graph theory, this monograph will provide advanced graduate students and researchers with the necessary background to understand and apply the methods presented.},

Here, we develop a computational approach for simulating the time evolution of Fokker-Planck solutions in terms of a mean field limit of an interacting particle system. The interactions between particles are determined by the gradient of the logarithm of the particle density, approximated here by a novel statistical estimator. The performance of our method shows promising results, with more accurate and less fluctuating statistics compared to direct stochastic simulations of comparable particle number. Taken together, our framework allows for effortless and reliable particle-based simulations of Fokker-Planck equations in low and moderate dimensions.

abstract = {This paper describes continuum models for swarming behavior based on non-local interactions. The interactions are assumed to influence the velocity of the organisms. The model consists of integro-differential advection-diffusion equations, with convolution terms that describe long range attraction and repulsion. We find that if density dependence in the repulsion term is of a higher order than in the attraction term, then the swarm profile is realistic: i.e. the swarm has a constant interior density, with sharp edges, as observed in biological examples. This is our main result. Linear stability analysis, singular perturbation theory, and numerical experiments reveal that weak, density-independent diffusion leads to disintegration of the swarm, but only on an exponentially large time scale. When density dependence is put into the diffusion term, we find that true, locally stable traveling band solutions occur. We further explore the effects of local and non-local density dependent drift and unequal ranges of attraction and repulsion. We compare our results with results of some local models, and find that such models cannot account for cohesive, finite swarms with realistic density profiles. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 1999.},

Swarming is a prominent example, where collective effects arising from interactions of individuals are essential for the understanding of large-scale spatial population dynamics, and where both levels of modeling have been often employed without establishing this connection.Here, we consider a system of self-propelled agents with velocity alignment in 2D and derive a mean-field theory from the microscopic dynamics via a nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation and a moment expansion of the probability density. We analyze the stationary solutions corresponding to macroscopic collective motion (ordered state) and the disordered solution with no collective motion in the spatially homogeneous system. In particular, we discuss the impact of different propulsion functions governing individual dynamics. Our results predict a strong impact of individual dynamics on the mean field onset of collective motion (continuous vs discontinuous). In addition to the macroscopic density and velocity fields, we consider the effective " temperature" field, measuring velocity fluctuations around the mean velocity. We show that the temperature decreases strongly with increasing level of collective motion despite constant fluctuations on individual level, which suggests that extreme caution should be taken in deducing individual behavior, such as, state-dependent individual fluctuations from mean-field measurements (Yates et al., 2009). {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Large-eddy simulation is used to study the sensitivity of trade wind cumulus clouds to pertur-bations in cloud droplet number concentrations. We find that the trade wind cumulus system approaches a radiative-convective equilibrium state, modified by net warming and drying from imposed large-scale advective forcing. The system requires several days to reach equilibrium when cooling rates are specified but much less time, and with less sensitivity to cloud droplet number density, when radiation depends real-istically on the vertical distribution of water vapor. The transient behavior and the properties of the near-equilibrium cloud field depend on the microphysical state and therefore on the cloud droplet number den-sity, here taken as a proxy for the ambient aerosol. The primary response of the cloud field to changes in the cloud droplet number density is deepening of the cloud layer. This deepening leads to a decrease in rel-ative humidity and a faster evaporation of small clouds and cloud remnants constituting a negative lifetime effect. In the near-equilibrium regime, the decrease in cloud cover compensates much of the Twomey effect, i.e., the brightening of the clouds, and the overall aerosol effect on the albedo of the organized pre-cipitating cumulus cloud field is small.},

abstract = {We introduce the concept of mean-field optimal control which is the rigorous limit process connecting finite dimensional optimal control problems with ODE constraints modeling multi-agent interactions to an infinite dimensional optimal control problem with a constraint given by a PDE of Vlasov-type, governing the dynamics of the probability distribution of interacting agents. While in the classical mean-field theory one studies the behavior of a large number of small individuals freely interacting with each other, by simplifying the effect of all the other individuals on any given individual by a single averaged effect, we address the situation where the individuals are actually influenced also by an external policy maker, and we propagate its effect for the number N of individuals going to infinity. On the one hand, from a modeling point of view, we take into account also that the policy maker is constrained to act according to optimal strategies promoting its most parsimonious interaction with the group of individuals. This will be realized by considering cost functionals including L{\textless}sup{\textgreater}1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}-norm terms penalizing a broadly distributed control of the group, while promoting its sparsity. On the other hand, from the analysis point of view, and for the sake of generality, we consider broader classes of convex control penalizations. In order to develop this new concept of limit rigorously, we need to carefully combine the classical concept of mean-field limit, connecting the finite dimensional system of ODE describing the dynamics of each individual of the group to the PDE describing the dynamics of the respective probability distribution, with the well-known concept of $\Gamma$-convergence to show that optimal strategies for the finite dimensional problems converge to optimal strategies of the infinite dimensional problem.},

Control, 52 (2007), pp. 852862], which describes the collective behavior of an ensemble of organisms, animals, or devices. This kinetic version introduced in [S.-Y. Ha and E. Tadmor, Kinet. Relat. Models, 1 (2008), pp. 415-435] is here obtained starting from a Boltzmann-type equation. The large-time behavior of the distribution in phase space is subsequently studied by means of particle approximations and a stability property in distances between measures. A continuous analogue of the theorems of [F. Cucker and S. Smale, IEEE Trans. Automat. Control, 52 (2007), pp. 852-862] is shown to hold for the solutions on the kinetic model. More precisely, the solutions will concentrate exponentially fast in velocity to the mean velocity of the initial condition, while in space they will converge towards a translational flocking solution. {\textcopyright} 2010 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},

abstract = {The synchronization of human networks is essential for our civilization and understanding its dynamics is important to many aspects of our lives. Human ensembles were investigated, but in noisy environments and with limited control over the network parameters which govern the network dynamics. Specifically, research has focused predominantly on all-to-all coupling, whereas current social networks and human interactions are often based on complex coupling configurations. Here, we study the synchronization between violin players in complex networks with full and accurate control over the network connectivity, coupling strength, and delay. We show that the players can tune their playing period and delete connections by ignoring frustrating signals, to find a stable solution. These additional degrees of freedom enable new strategies and yield better solutions than are possible within current models such as the Kuramoto model. Our results may influence numerous fields, including traffic management, epidemic control, and stock market dynamics.},

abstract = {We provide a thorough study of stability of the 1-D continuity equation, which models many physical conservation laws. In our system-theoretic perspective, the velocity is considered to be an input. An additional input appears in the boundary condition (boundary disturbance). Stability estimates are provided in all Lp state norms with p{\textgreater}1, including the case p=+∞. However, in our Input-to-State Stability estimates, the gain and overshoot coefficients depend on the velocity. Moreover, the logarithmic norm of the state appears instead of the usual norm. The obtained results can be used in the stability analysis of larger models that contain the continuity equation. In particular, it is shown that the obtained results can be used in a straightforward way for the stability analysis of non-local, nonlinear manufacturing models under feedback control.},

@article{Qi2015a,
abstract = {This paper introduces a methodology for modelling, analysis, and control design of a large-scale system of agents deployed in 3-D space. The agents' communication graph is a mesh-grid disk 2-D topology in polar coordinates. Treating the agents as a continuum, we model the agents' collective dynamics by complex-valued reaction-diffusion 2-D partial differential equations (PDEs) in polar coordinates, whose states represent the position coordinates of the agents. Due to the reaction term in the PDEs, the agents can achieve a rich family of 2-D deployment manifolds in 3-D space which correspond to the PDEs' equilibrium as determined by the boundary conditions. Unfortunately, many of these deployment surfaces are open-loop unstable. To stabilize them, a heretofore open and challenging problem of PDE stabilization by boundary control on a disk has been solved in this paper, using a new class of explicit backstepping kernels that involve the Poisson kernel. A dual observer, which is also explicit, allows to estimate the positions of all the agents, as needed in the leaders' feedback, by only measuring the position of their closest neighbors. Hence, an all-explicit control scheme is found which is distributed in the sense that each agent only needs local information. Closed-loop exponential stability in the L2, H1, and H2 spaces is proved for both full state and output feedback designs. Numerical simulations illustrate the proposed approach for 3-D deployment of discrete agents.},

Persuasible agents are inclined to compromise with interacting individuals. Stubborn individuals slightly modify their opinion during the interaction. Collective states for persuasible societies include extremist minorities, which instead decline in stubborn societies. We derive a mean field approximation for the compromise model in stubborn populations.

Many self-organizing microrobotic collectives have been developed to overcome inherent limits in actuation, sensing, and manipulation of individual microrobots; however, reconfigurable collectives with robust transitions between behaviors are rare. Such systems that perform multiple functions are advantageous to operate in complex environments. Here, we present a versatile microrobotic collective system capable of on-demand reconfiguration to adapt to and utilize their environments to perform various functions at the air–water interface. Our system exhibits diverse modes ranging from isotropic to anisotrpic behaviors and transitions between a globally driven and a novel self-propelling behavior. We show the transition between different modes in experiments and simulations, and demonstrate various functions, using the reconfigurability of our system to navigate, explore, and interact with the environment. Such versatile microrobot collectives with globally driven and self-propelled behaviors have great potential in future medical and environmental applications.},

abstract = {In most swarm systems, agents are either aware of the position of their direct neighbors or they possess a substrate on which they can deposit information (stigmergy). However, such resources are not always obtainable in real-world applications because of hardware and environmental constraints. In this paper we study in 2D simulation the design of a swarm system which does not make use of positioning information or stigmergy. This endeavor is motivated by an application whereby a large number of Swarming Micro Air Vehicles (SMAVs), of fixed-wing configuration, must organize autonomously to establish a wireless communication network (SMAVNET) between users located on ground. Rather than relative or absolute positioning, agents must rely only on their own heading measurements and local communication with neighbors. Designing local interactions responsible for the emergence of the SMAVNET deployment and maintenance is a challenging task. For this reason, artificial evolution is used to automatically develop neuronal controllers for the swarm of homogenous agents. This approach has the advantage of yielding original and efficient swarming strategies. A detailed behavioral analysis is then performed on the fittest swarm to gain insight as to the behavior of the individual agents.},

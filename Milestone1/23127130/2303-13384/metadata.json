    "abstract": "The Hawkes graph $Γ_H(G)$ of $G$ is the directed graph whose vertex set coincides with $π(G)$ and it has the edge $(p, q)$ whenever $q\\inπ(G/O_{p',p}(G))$. The Sylow graph $Γ_s(G)$ of $G$ is the directed graph with vertex set $π(G)$ and $(p, q)$ is an edge of $Γ_s(G)$ whenever $q \\inπ(N_G(P)/PC_G(P))$ for some Sylow $p$-subgroup $P$ of $G$. The $N$-critical graph $Γ_{Nc}(G)$ of a group $G$ the directed graph whose vertex set coincides with $π(G)$ such that $(p, q)$ is an edge of $Γ_{Nc}(G)$ whenever $G$ contains a Schmidt $(p, q)$-subgroup, i.e. a Schmidt $\\{p, q\\}$-subgroup with a normal Sylow $p$-subgroup. In the paper the Hawkes, the Sylow and the $N$-critical graphs of the products of totally permutable, mutually permutable and $\\mathfrak{N}$-connected subgroups are studied.",

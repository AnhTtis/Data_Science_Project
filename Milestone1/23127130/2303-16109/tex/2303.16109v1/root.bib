abstract="With the objective to improve road safety, the automotive industry is moving toward more ``intelligent'' vehicles. One of the major challenges is to detect dangerous situations and react accordingly in order to avoid or mitigate accidents. This requires predicting the likely evolution of the current traffic situation, and assessing how dangerous that future situation might be. This paper is a survey of existing methods for motion prediction and risk assessment for intelligent vehicles. The proposed classification is based on the semantics used to define motion and risk. We point out the tradeoff between model completeness and real-time constraints, and the fact that the choice of a risk assessment method is influenced by the selected motion model.",

abstract="In order to plan a safe maneuver an autonomous vehicle must accurately perceive its environment, and understand the interactions among traffic participants. In this paper, we aim to learn scene-consistent motion forecasts of complex urban traffic directly from sensor data. In particular, we propose to characterize the joint distribution over future trajectories via an implicit latent variable model. We model the scene as an interaction graph and employ powerful graph neural networks to learn a distributed latent representation of the scene. Coupled with a deterministic decoder, we obtain trajectory samples that are consistent across traffic participants, achieving state-of-the-art results in motion forecasting and interaction understanding. Last but not least, we demonstrate that our motion forecasts result in safer and more comfortable motion planning.",

  abstract = 	 {We present a new method for multi-modal, long-term vehicle trajectory prediction. Our approach relies on using lane centerlines captured in rich maps of the environment to generate a set of proposed goal paths for each vehicle. Using these paths – which are generated at run time and therefore dynamically adapt to the scene – as spatial anchors, we predict a set of goal-based trajectories along with a categorical distribution over the goals. This approach allows us to directly model the goal-directed behavior of traffic actors, which unlocks the potential for more accurate long-term prediction. Our experimental results on both a large-scale internal driving dataset and on the public nuScenes dataset show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for vehicle trajectory prediction over a 6-second horizon. We also empirically demonstrate that our model is better able to generalize to road scenes from a completely new city than existing methods.}

abstract="We propose a motion forecasting model that exploits a novel structured map representation as well as actor-map interactions. Instead of encoding vectorized maps as raster images, we construct a lane graph from raw map data to explicitly preserve the map structure. To capture the complex topology and long range dependencies of the lane graph, we propose LaneGCN which extends graph convolutions with multiple adjacency matrices and along-lane dilation. To capture the complex interactions between actors and maps, we exploit a fusion network consisting of four types of interactions, actor-to-lane, lane-to-lane, lane-to-actor and actor-to-actor. Powered by LaneGCN and actor-map interactions, our model is able to predict accurate and realistic multi-modal trajectories. Our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on the large scale Argoverse motion forecasting benchmark.",

abstract="Reasoning about human motion is an important prerequisite to safe and socially-aware robotic navigation. As a result, multi-agent behavior prediction has become a core component of modern human-robot interactive systems, such as self-driving cars. While there exist many methods for trajectory forecasting, most do not enforce dynamic constraints and do not account for environmental information (e.g., maps). Towards this end, we present Trajectron++, a modular, graph-structured recurrent model that forecasts the trajectories of a general number of diverse agents while incorporating agent dynamics and heterogeneous data (e.g., semantic maps). Trajectron++ is designed to be tightly integrated with robotic planning and control frameworks; for example, it can produce predictions that are optionally conditioned on ego-agent motion plans. We demonstrate its performance on several challenging real-world trajectory forecasting datasets, outperforming a wide array of state-of-the-art deterministic and generative methods.",

abstract="Multi-agent trajectory forecasting in autonomous driving requires an agent to accurately anticipate the behaviors of the surrounding vehicles and pedestrians, for safe and reliable decision-making. Due to partial observability in these dynamical scenes, directly obtaining the posterior distribution over future agent trajectories remains a challenging problem. In realistic embodied environments, each agent's future trajectories should be both diverse since multiple plausible sequences of actions can be used to reach its intended goals, and admissible since they must obey physical constraints and stay in drivable areas. In this paper, we propose a model that synthesizes multiple input signals from the multimodal world|the environment's scene context and interactions between multiple surrounding agents|to best model all diverse and admissible trajectories. We compare our model with strong baselines and ablations across two public datasets and show a significant performance improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods. Lastly, we offer new metrics incorporating admissibility criteria to further study and evaluate the diversity of predictions. Codes are at: https://github.com/kami93/CMU-DATF.",

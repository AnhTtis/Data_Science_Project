    "abstract": "We examine what happens if we replace ZFC with a localistic/relativistic system, LZFC, whose central new axiom, denoted by $Loc({\\rm ZFC})$, says that every set belongs to a transitive model of ZFC. LZFC consists of $Loc({\\rm ZFC})$ plus some elementary axioms forming Basic Set Theory (BST). Some theoretical reasons for this shift of view are given. All $Π_2$ consequences of ZFC are provable in ${\\rm LZFC}$. LZFC strongly extends Kripke-Platek (KP) set theory minus $Δ_0$-Collection and minus $\\in$-induction scheme. ZFC+``there is an inaccessible cardinal'' proves the consistency of LZFC. In LZFC we focus on models rather than cardinals, a transitive model being considered as the analogue of an inaccessible cardinal. Pushing this analogy further we define $α$-Mahlo models and $Π_1^1$-indescribable models, the latter being the analogues of weakly compact cardinals. Also localization axioms of the form $Loc({\\rm ZFC}+φ)$ are considered and their global consequences are examined. Finally we introduce the concept of standard compact cardinal (in ZFC) and some standard compactness results are proved.",

We find that the walker distribution, and a number of properties associated with it, are significantly altered by the 
coin disorder.

\section{Introduction}
Quantum walks have shown significant potential in quantum computing applications 
as a practical tool to build quantum 
algorithms~\cite{She03,Ven12,Kad21,San12,Lecca19,Childs04,Tul08,Mag11,Xia20,Qia21,Aca20,Boe20}.
Even more so, quantum walks are computationally universal
as Childs has shown in his seminal paper~\cite{Childs09}.
% that any quantum algorithm may be recast as a quantum walk algorithm~\cite{Childs09}.
Long-standing results of quantum walks outperforming their 
classical counterparts, see, e.g., Refs.~\cite{Tul08,Aha2001,Moo02,Kempe05,Wong18,Far98,Childs04,Ape22},
thus substantiate the promises of quantum technologies to revolutionize 
real-world applications in the near future,
such as high-performance computing or secure communications~\cite{Deu20,Aru19,Gio06,Pez18,Zhong20,Zhang17}.
Despite continuous progress in quantum computing, arguably two of the most influential 
quantum algorithms have been developed decades ago, namely Shor's factorizing algorithm~\cite{Shor} and
Grover's search algorithm~\cite{Grover}. It turns out that designing algorithms with quantum 
advantage is intricate~\cite{Niel10} and thus it is important to properly understand the fundamental building
blocks of these algorithms which can be formulated in terms of quantum walks.
It is the purpose of this work to explore the influence of disorder on quantum walks.
Disorder may arise naturally as undesirable error from
% noisy quantum devices 
faulty quantum operations
but could potentially be used as a tailored resource to improve computational performance
of quantum algorithms.
% 
It is well-established that disordered quantum media may lead to wave localization since the 
discovery of Anderson localization~\cite{And58}, see also Ref.~\cite{Bik09} for a 
comprehensive overview. The localization phenomenon has been 
explored in a variety of setups~\cite{Billy08,Roati08,Kan98,For96,Schw07,Lah08,Wie97,Sto06,Inui04},
even without disorder~\cite{Jahnke08}.
% 
In this work we will explore disorder induced localization in quantum walks and its
implications on entanglement properties.

To this end, we are interested in coined quantum walks (CQWs) that are routinely described
as bipartite quantum system consisting of a `walker' and a `quantum coin', see 
Fig.~\ref{fig:dtqw}. 
The walker may occupy sites on a certain geometry (line, circle, general graphs, etc.) and the coin is a 
two level system\footnote{For CQWs on graphs or higher dimensional
geometries, quantum coins with more levels are necessary.} whose
state determines the walker propagation.
Further details will be introduced in Sec.~\ref{sec:model}.
%

    overlap indicating coin-walker entanglement.}
    \label{fig:dtqw}
\end{figure}
%
%
CQWs are generalizations of classical random walks to the quantum realm. Similar to a classical 
random walk on the line, where a coin toss decides whether a walker hops left or right, 
a quantum coin toss decides how the walker spreads over the lattice.
Here we explore the effects of quenched disorder in the quantum coin toss such that the 
coin differs on different lattice sites.

In contrast to their classical counterparts, CQWs are generally deterministic since
the underlying dynamics is unitary. Further differentiating factors are that
CQWs occupy several sites simultaneously due to quantum superposition and 
the coin-walker interaction yields entanglement.
It has been argued that the natural classical counterpart of CQWs 
are classical random walk with one-step memory~\cite{Wu19}.
This memory may yield faster spreading than a Markovian classical 
random walk. However,
CQWs still spread asymptotically faster, due to quantum interference~\cite{Wu19}.

% {\color{red} The natural counterpart of the coined quantum walk is the classical random walk with one-step memory. Except the case where the walkers have equal probability of going left and right, this one-step memory contribute to speed up the spreading in general. However, the authors have shown that even with one-step memory, the quantum walk still spreads faster in the asymptotic limit when $t\rightarrow\infty$, due to the quantum interference.}

Beyond their computational universality, CQWs find applications in, e.g., neural 
networks to capture the structure of graphs~\cite{dernbach2019quantum,Dernbach2019}.
Here, feature-dependent coins are used at different nodes and CQWs can be used to classify graphs.
% 
% The coined quantum walk is used to capture
% the structure of the graphs in the QWNN. By using fea-
% ture dependent coins at different nodes, quantum walk
% represents a controlled diffusion on graphs and thus can
% be used to do graph classifications and regression.
% 
Hence, varying coin features may be exploited to perform 
relevant tasks. Similarly,
the coin may be used to bias CQWs~\cite{Stef_2009}.
% 
% biased DTWQ~\cite{Stef_2009}
% {\color{red}The authors studied the biased DTQW by introducing biased initial coin state, coin operator and /or unit step length. By tuning the bias parameter, the authors found that there is a region where no initial condition will induce unbiased distribution withe zero means.}
% 
It is thus obvious that the coin operations and states play a fundamental role in the 
character of CQWs which further motivates our study of 
quenched coin disorder.

The manuscript is organized as follows. In Sec.~\ref{sec:model}, we introduce CQWs starting from the 
Hadamard walk. We consider how the wave function of the composite system evolves in time and show 
the analytical solution of the Hadamard walk. We then introduce the coin disorder and 
discuss how averages over disorder realizations are taken. In Sec.~\ref{sec:proba}, we 
explore the effects of coin disorder on the quantum state of the bipartite system and the walker occupation probability. We find that the disorder significantly slows down the underlying dynamics
% 
% We consider quantities such as the return probability, the state fidelity, mixing properties and 
% the mean squared displacement. We
% 
and argue that our findings are consistent with a walker localization.
We further support this in Sec.~\ref{sec:entanglement}
by considering the entanglement entropy and the entanglement negativity. Both these entanglement 
witnesses reveal features that substantiate the localization hypothesis. 
We contrast our results by considering different boundary conditions in Sec.~\ref{sec:bcs}.
In Sec.~\ref{sec:conclusion},
we summarize our results and discuss some interesting future directions. Appendix~\ref{app:HW} follows
Ref.~\cite{nayak2000quantum} to detail how the Hadamard walk is solved in Fourier space.





\section{The Model}
\label{sec:model}
%
CQWs are bipartite quantum systems made up from a walker and a quantum coin, see Fig.~\ref{fig:dtqw}. 
Here, we consider arguably the simplest setup where the coin is a two-level system
with corresponding coin Hilbert space
$\mathcal{H}_c =\operatorname{span}\{\ket{\down},\ket{\up}\} = \mathbb{C}^2$
and the walker propagates on the infinite line (alterations are readily introduced).
Thus, the position $x$ of the walker can take on discrete values $x \in \mathbb{Z}$ and 
the walker Hilbert space is 
$\mathcal{H}_w = \operatorname{span} \{\ket{x}\, |\,  x\in\mathbb{Z}\}$. 
The composite system is described by quantum states residing in the 
Hilbert space $\mathcal{H} = \mathcal{H}_w \otimes \mathcal{H}_c$.
%
%
This bipartite system undergoes a two-step discrete-time dynamics as follows.
Given a quantum state $\ket{\psi(t)} \in \mathcal{H}$ at time $t$,
first a quantum coin operator
$C$ is applied. $C$ is such that, although it acts on the full Hilbert space, the walker 
occupation probability, i.e., 
%
%
\begin{align}
\label{eq:p}
    p_x = \left|\braket{x\up|\psi(t)}\right|^2 + \left|\braket{x\down|\psi(t)}\right|^2
\end{align}
%
%
remain unchanged. Subsequently, a shift operator $S$ is applied that propagates the walker along 
the line depending of the state of the two-level system, i.e., 
$\ket{\psi(t+1)} = SC \ket{\psi(t)}$. Time-evolved states are thus deduced from the 
initial state as
%
%
\begin{align}
    \ket{\psi(t)} =(SC)^t \ket{\psi(0)}.
    \label{eq:propagation}
\end{align}
%
%
Arguably the most studied CQW is the Hadamard walk which is defined by the following 
operators
%
%
\begin{align}
    C &= \mathds{1}_w \otimes H    = \mathds{1}_w \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1&1\\
    1&-1
    \end{bmatrix},\label{eq:HW_C}
    \\[.25cm]
    %
    S&= \sum_{x\in\mathbb{Z}} \ket{x+1}\bra{x} \otimes \ket{\up}\bra{\up} + \ket{x-1}\bra{x} \otimes \ket{\down}\bra{\down}.
    \label{eq:HW_S}
\end{align}
%
%
For the Hadamard walk, each site is equivalent and a `fair' coin toss propagates
the walker. 
% As opposed to a classical random walk, the time evolution of 
% the Hadamard walk is unitary and in particular $C^2 = \mathds{1}$.
The initial coin 
configuration yields the potential for an underlying 
drift in the Hadamard walk since the time evolution is unitary.
This is usually circumvented by considering 
%
%
\begin{align}\label{eq:initial}
\ket{\psi(0)} = \ket{0} \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\ket{\down}+\II\ket{\up}\right).
\end{align}
%
%
as initial state.
The initial coin state is an eigenstate of the $Y$ gate. Since the Hadamard gate is a 
superposition of the $X$ and the $Z$ gate, this initial coin state ensures that there is no 
drift and the dynamics is symmetric.

% \sout{Although over time coin and walker will entangle and one thus cannot properly define a coin state, 
% it is instructive to note that iterative application of the Hadamard gate on the initial coin state
% will cycle through the Pauli $y$ eigenstates.}
% 
The Hadamard walk and its applications have
been extensively studied, see, e.g., Refs.~\cite{Kon04,nayak2000quantum,Obu15,Tre03,carneiro2005entanglement} to name a few. 
Due to the spatial homogeneity of the coin operator,
the time-evolved wave function can even be analytically derived~\cite{nayak2000quantum}. In App.~\ref{app:HW} we recall how to solve the Hadamard walk, following Ref.~\cite{nayak2000quantum}.
For the initial state~(\ref{eq:initial}) we find
%
\begin{widetext}
    \begin{align}
    \braket{x\down|\psi(t)} &= 
    \frac{1+(-1)^{t+x}}{2^{(t+3)/2}} \int_{-\pi}^\pi 
    \frac{\mathrm{d}k}{2\pi} e^{-\II kx} 
    \left(\sqrt{1+\cos^2 k} - \II \sin k \right)^t\left( 
    1+\frac{\cos k}{\sqrt{1+\cos^2 k}} + \II \frac{e^{-\II k}}{\sqrt{1+\cos^2k}}
    \right),\\[.5cm]
    %
    \braket{x\up|\psi(t)} &=\frac{1+(-1)^{t+x}}{2^{(t+3)/2}} \int_{-\pi}^\pi 
    \frac{\mathrm{d}k}{2\pi} e^{-\II kx} 
    \left(\sqrt{1+\cos^2 k} - \II \sin k \right)^t\left( 
    \II \left[1-\frac{\cos k}{\sqrt{1+\cos^2 k}}\right] +  \frac{e^{\II k}}{\sqrt{1+\cos^2k}}
    \right).
    \end{align}
\end{widetext}
% 
The most salient 
feature of the walker occupation probability for the Hadamard walk 
consists of two ballistically propagating peaks emerging
from the origin, see Fig.~\ref{fig:HW}.
%

    times $t=20,40,60,80$ for a Hadamard walk with the initial 
    state~(\ref{eq:initial}).
    The upper right panel illustrates the vanishing center probability $p_0$
    and how the distribution flattens with time. The lower right panel shows 
    the travelling peaks. These results are obtained from the simulation of
    Eq.~(\ref{eq:propagation}).
    }
    \label{fig:HW}
\end{figure}
% 
% 
The width of these peaks scales asymptotically as $O(t^{1/3})$ and between the peaks the wave function is 
essentially uniformly distributed~\cite{nayak2000quantum}.
Over time, coin and walker become entangled.
This entanglement can be quantified by the entanglement entropy (EE), viz.,
% 
% 
\begin{align}
 S = \operatorname{tr} \rho_c \ln \rho_c.
 \label{eq:EE}
\end{align}
%
%
Here, $\rho_c = \operatorname{tr}_w \rho$ is the reduced density matrix of the coin obtained by 
tracing out the walker degrees of freedom from the full density matrix $\rho$.
For the Hadamard walk, the EE settles to a constant value around 
$0.605$~\cite{carneiro2005entanglement}.\footnote{We considered 
the natural logarithm to estimate this absolute value which is therefore distinct from the value reported in 
Ref.~\cite{carneiro2005entanglement}.}


Certain aspects of disorder in quantum walks have been studied in the past, see, e.g., 
Refs.~\cite{Schr11,Zeng17,Yin08,Rako15,Jack12}.
Here, we are interested in the effects of disorder in the coin operator
on the properties of CQWs.
%
%
% \begin{figure}
%     \centering
%     \includegraphics[width=.9\columnwidth]{bloch.pdf}
%     \caption{\hl{FIGURE IS NOT CORRECT...}}
%     \label{fig:bloch}
% \end{figure}
%
% 
%
%
We consider the gate
% 
% 
\begin{align}
    G(r) = 
    % \cos(\theta) Z +\sin(\theta) X
     \begin{pmatrix}
     \sqrt{r} & \sqrt{1-r} \\[.2cm]
     \sqrt{1-r} & -\sqrt{r}
     \end{pmatrix}
    % =
    % \begin{bmatrix}
    % \cos\theta & \sin\theta\\[.2cm]
    % \sin\theta & -\cos\theta
    % \end{bmatrix}.
\end{align}
% 
% 
with $r\in[0,1]$. For certain values of $r$ the gate $G$ reduces to common gates, viz.,
% 
% 
\begin{align}
    G(0) = X, \quad G(1/2) = H, \quad G(1) = Z.
\end{align}
% 
% 
We shall consider CQWs in which the lattice site $x$ has an assigned random number $r_x$
and an associated gate $G(r_x)$. The coin operator is then altered as follows
% 
% 
\begin{align}\label{eq:C}
    C(\{r_x\}) = \sum_{x\in\mathbb{Z}} \ket{x}\bra{x}\otimes G(r_x).
\end{align}
%
%
$G(r_x)$ is still composed of an $X$ and a $Z$ gate, viz., 
$G(r_x) = \sqrt{r_x} Z + \sqrt{1-r_x} X$ such that the initial state in Eq.~(\ref{eq:initial})
still yields a symmetric propagation.

% It is intuitive and straightforward to show that $C(\{r_x\})$ does not alter the local 
% occupation probabilities $p_x$.

Although the coin operator is still in block diagonal form, it does not trivially factorize anymore
into a product of two operators acting on $\mathcal{H}_w$ and $\mathcal{H}_c$ separately.
We introduce a parameter $W$ that controls the disorder strength, i.e.,
%
% 
\begin{align}
    r_x = \frac{1}{2}\left(1 + W \xi_x\right) .
    %\theta_x = \frac{\pi}{4}\left(1 + \epsilon \xi_x\right)
\end{align}
% 
% 
Here, $\xi_x\in [-1,1]$ are uniformly distributed random numbers. This choice readily
recovers the Hadamard walk for $W = 0$ and a completely disordered walk for $W = 1$.
% \sw{This model can be connected to 
% the Chalker-Coddington model ...}


To analyze the influence of the quenched coin disorder on CQWs, we study 
different disorder realizations.
We write $\{\xi_x^{(i)}\}$ where $i=1,2,...$ labels the realization. 
Each realization $i$ yields a quantum state $\rho_i(t) = |\psi^{(i)}(t)\rangle\langle\psi^{(i)}(t)|$. 
Any system quantity $f$ can be evaluated in two distinct ways.
Either we first evaluate the density matrix of the ensemble of realizations
\begin{equation}
\overline{\rho_i} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \ket{\psi^{(i)}}\bra{\psi^{(i)}}
\end{equation}
and then evaluate the ensemble average $f(\overline{\rho_i})$ or we first evaluate $f$ for a 
certain realization and then compute the realization average
\begin{equation}
\overline{f(\rho_i)} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N f\left(\ket{\psi^{(i)}}\bra{\psi^{(i)}}\right).
\end{equation}
For linear observables, both averages are equivalent, and the expectation values of
an operator $O$ can be defined uniquely as $\braket{O} = \mathrm{Tr}\left(O\overline{\rho_i}\right)$. Hence, the walker occupation probability
$p_x = \operatorname{tr}\left( \ket{x}\bra{x} \overline{\rho_i} \right)$
is directly obtained as
\begin{equation}
p_x(t) = \frac{1}{N}
\sum_{i=1}^N \big|\braket{x\up|\psi^{(i)}(t)}\big|^2 + \big|\braket{x\down|\psi^{(i)}(t)}\big|^2.
\label{eq:px}
\end{equation}
However, for nonlinear $f$ such as entanglement entropy which we will consider in 
Sec.~\ref{sec:entanglement}, the two averages differ.


% We write
% $\{\xi_x^{(i)}\}$ where $i=,1,2,...$ labels the realization.
% Each realization $i$ yields a quantum state $\ket{\psi^{(i)}(t)}$ and physical 
% quantities may be extracted from the resulting density matrix
% %
% %
% \begin{align}
%     \rho(t) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \ket{\psi^{(i)}(t)}\bra{\psi^{(i)}(t)} .
% \end{align}
% %
% %
% Relevant expectation values of operators $O$ are then obtained in the standard fashion, i.e.,
% $\braket{O}(t) = \mathrm{Tr}\left(O\rho(t)\right)$. We shall refer to this average 
% as ensemble average. Alternatively, we may first evaluate the 
% averaged walker probability
% %
% %
% \begin{align}
% p_x = \frac{1}{N}    
% \sum_{i=1}^N \big|\braket{x\up|\psi^{(i)}(t)}\big|^2 + \big|\braket{x\down|\psi^{(i)}(t)}\big|^2
% \label{eq:px}
% \end{align}
% %
% %
% and subsequently evaluate observable averages as
% %
% %
% \begin{align}
%     \bar{O}(t) = \sum_{x} 
%     \bra{x}O\ket{x} p_x(t).
% \end{align}
% % \begin{align}
% %     \bar{O}(t) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N 
% %     \bra{\psi^{(i)}(t)}O\ket{\psi^{(i)}(t)}.
% % \end{align}
% %
% %
% We shall refer to this average as realization average. Both, the ensemble and realization
% average are equivalent if one considers observables that are linear in the quantum 
% states. Differences may occur whenever one calculates non-linear observables such 
% as the EE.
%
%
% \begin{align}
%     S = - \operatorname{Tr}\left( \rho \ln \rho\right).
% \end{align}
%
%
%% i don't think either of them are directly experimental relevant. These nonlinear quantities are not really observables and are calculated from the linear observables.

% \section{Numerical results}
% Here we discuss different aspects from the numerical simulation of the disordered quantum walk. 


\section{Walker occupation probability}
\label{sec:proba}
\begin{figure}[t]

    {\bf Walker distribution of the disordered CQW.}
    The left panel shows the occupation probability 
    $p_x$ at $t=100$
    for a CQW with a disordered coin operator, see Eq.~(\ref{eq:C}), 
    starting in the initial state~(\ref{eq:initial}) for different 
    disorder strengths $W$.
    The upper right panel shows that the center peak does not vanish in
    the disordered case and the lower right panel shows that the traveling 
    peaks are suppressed with increasing disorder. These results 
    are obtained by averaging over $1000$ independent coin operator 
    initialization.}
    
    \label{fig:proba}
\end{figure}

In Fig.~\ref{fig:proba} we illustrate the walker occupation probability of a CQW 
(see  Eq.~(\ref{eq:px})) on the infinite line after $100$ time steps for different disorder strengths $W$. 
% 
For $W = 0$, i.e., the Hadamard walk, we again observe  the characteristic peaks from
Fig.~\ref{fig:HW}. 
% 
For small to moderate disorder strengths ($W = 0.2, 0.4$) these peaks persist but also a third, central peak 
appears which is qualitatively different from the Hadamard walk. 
% 
For larger disorder strengths, we observe that the 
central peak becomes the dominating feature of the probability distribution indicating that the walker 
is effectively trapped with at most a very slow underlying dynamics.
% 
This behavior is indicative of an Anderson localization in the disordered CQW.
% 
To analyze this localization further, we study properties of the probability distribution and the 
corresponding quantum wave function. Our results are illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:p_disordered}.
% 
The emergent centre peak can be quantified by the return probability $p_0$ of finding 
the walker on its initial site $x=0$. 
For the Hadamard walk it is known that $p_0$ decays algebraically as $\sim 1/t$.

    We consider different properties of the walker distribution and the quantum 
    state for different disorder strengths 
    $W=0$ (gray), 
    $W=0.2$ (blue), 
    $W=0.4$ (orange),
    $W=0.6$ (green),
    $W=0.8$ (red)
    $W=1$ (purple).
    Panel (a) shows the return probability $p_0$. For $W=0$ we 
    observe an algebraic decay as $p_0 \sim t^{-1}$ (as indicated by the 
    black dashed line). Conversely,
    for $W>0$ we see that $p_0>0$ at all times with the plateau 
    value increasing for stronger disorder.
    In panel (b) we compare the quantum state for $W>0$ to that of the Hadamard walk ($W=0$)
    using the
    state fidelity, see Eq.~(\ref{eq:F}). The quantum state quickly deviates from that 
    of the Hadamard walk, even for small $W$.

    that the occupation probability of the disordered walker deviate significantly from the flat

    grows sublogarithmically. In panel (f) this is confirmed by analyzing the growth exponent 
    $\sigma$, see Eq.~(\ref{eq:sigma}). While the Hadamard walk shows $\sigma=2$, for $W>0$ we
    consistently find $\sigma\to0$. All results are averaged over $1000$ independent disorder realizations.

    \label{fig:p_disordered}
\end{figure*}
%
% 
In Fig.~\ref{fig:p_disordered}(a), we see this algebraic decay for $W=0$ (note the logarithmic scales).
For different disorder strengths $W>0$, we see that the centre peak does not vanish. Instead we 
observe a finite return probability
for $W>0$ and the corresponding plateau value increases with increasing $W$.
% 
Hence, the character of the probability distribution is significantly altered.

To gather further insights into the nature of the dynamics of the disordered CQW, we
consider in Fig.~\ref{fig:p_disordered}(b) the state fidelity. We compare the quantum state
$\ket{\psi_i}$ of the
disordered composite system with that of the 
Hadamard walk $\ket{\varphi}$ at the same time, viz., 
\begin{align}
    F = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \left| \braket{\psi^{(i)} | \varphi} \right|^2.
    \label{eq:F}
\end{align}
We see that even for small $W$, the state deviates significantly 
from that of the Hadamard walk. The larger the disorder strength the faster the state deviates.



In Fig.~\ref{fig:p_disordered}(c) we analyze the influence of disorder on the mixing properties of 
the CQW. To this end, we compare the walker occupation probability distributions with the 
flat distribution. To ensure a meaningful flat state for the infinite system, we must consider that our initial system 
state implies that at even (odd) times only even (odd) sites can be occupied. 
Hence, we must consider the flat state restricted to the sites that correspond to the parity of the 
current time step and that lay within the physical light cone of the dynamics. Thus, we refer to 
the following probability distribution
% 
% 
\begin{align}
    p_{\rm flat}(x,t) = 
        \begin{dcases}
        1/(t+1),\ |x|\leq t \ \land \ (t-x) \ \text{even}\\%x \operatorname{mod} 2 = t \operatorname{mod} 2\\
        0, \quad \text{else}
        \end{dcases}
\end{align}
% 
% 
as the flat distribution at time $t$ for the system on the infinite line. 
The mixing ratio $M$ is then defined by the $1$-norm of the distance
% 
% 
\begin{align}
 M = \left\| p_x - p_{\rm flat}\right\|_1 .
 \label{eq:mixing}
\end{align}
% 
% 
As we observe from Fig.~\ref{fig:p_disordered}(c), a small amount of disorder $W$ 
initially increases the mixing of the 
quantum walk (e.g., for $W = 0.2$) which is probably related to the appearance of the centre peak.
Interestingly, eventually $M\to 2$ for $W>0$ in all cases we considered.
From Eq.~(\ref{eq:mixing}) it is obvious that the mixing ratio satisfies
$M\leq 2$. The fact that all walks tend toward the
maximum mixing ratio implies that the two distributions that are being compared do not have significant 
overlap. This means that the walker spreads {\it significantly slower} than the physical light cone.
In turn, the Hadamard walk ($W=0$) keeps up with the light cone and the mixing ratio does not reach 
$M=2$.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:p_disordered}(d) we further characterize the slow dynamics considering 
the mean squared displacement of the quantum walker, viz.,
%
%
\begin{align}
    \langle x^2 \rangle = \sum_{x\in\mathbb{Z}} p_x x^2.
\end{align}
For the Hadamard walk we see that, as expected, $\langle x^2 \rangle$ grows quadratically,
indicating a ballistic dynamics (note again the logarithmic scale in Fig.~\ref{fig:p_disordered}(d)).
%
The coin-disorder yet again significantly alters this behavior. 
For $W>0$, we see that the mean squared displacement deviates from that of the Hadamard walk on a 
finite time scale that decreases with increasing disorder strength and eventually always becomes 
subdiffusive. 

In Fig.~\ref{fig:p_disordered}(e) we reconsider the mean squared displacement with the Hadamard walk 
removed and rescaled by $\log t$. We see that $\langle x^2 \rangle$ grows at most 
sublogarithmically, see, e.g., $W=0.8, 1$. To further analyze the growth behavior, we assume that
it may be characterized by a power-law, i.e., $\langle x^2 \rangle \sim t^\sigma$. 
This allows to extract the growth exponent $\sigma$ as
%
%
\begin{align}
    \frac{\mathrm{d}\log \langle x^2 \rangle}{\mathrm{d} \log t} = \sigma.
    \label{eq:sigma}
\end{align}
%
%
In Fig.~\ref{fig:p_disordered}(f) we extract this exponent numerically by interpolating the data using 
smoothed cubic splines and evaluating the 
numerical derivative. For a ballistic spreading ($W=0$), we find $\sigma = 2$.
Conversely, a diffusive dynamics would yield $\sigma =1$.
% 
When $\sigma = 0$, 
there is no spreading and instead a localization phenomenon
takes place~\cite{Duda22}. For any $W>0$, we see from Fig.~\ref{fig:p_disordered}(f) that $\sigma \to 0$.
Hence, 
we find strong numerical evidence that the CQW with coin disorder localizes on the length- and time-scales
we explored.

\section{Entanglement properties}
\label{sec:entanglement}
%
%

Since the coin disorder significantly alters the dynamics of the quantum walk, it is interesting to
explore the effects of disorder on the entanglement between coin and walker.
The initial state given in Eq.~(\ref{eq:initial}) is a pure product state and thus, walker and coin are initially 
not entangled.
Without disorder, the system remains at all times in a pure state and therefore the EE
(see Eq.~(\ref{eq:EE})) is a good entanglement quantifier. As we have explained in Sec.~\ref{sec:model}, 
in the presence of coin disorder we may consider 
either the ensemble average or the realization average.  The ensemble average describes the statistical 
state of the system but is generally not pure and thus the EE is not a faithful entanglement witness. 
Conversely, every realization stays in a pure state at all times and thus the EE is a good 
entanglement witness for each individual run.
Hence,
to quantify the effects of disorder on the EE we consider the EE for each realization individually 
and average the resulting EEs afterwards.
% 
% realization average since
% every realization itself stays in a pure quantum state at all times and thus the EE is a good entanglement 
% witness for each individual run.
%
In Fig.~\ref{fig:EE} we show the resulting EE.
First, we see that we recover the well-known result for the Hadamard walk for $W=0$~\cite{carneiro2005entanglement}.
Further, we observe that the average entanglement of the CQW with coin disorder is lower than that of the
Hadamard walk,
indicating that the disorder effectively decreases the entanglement between walker and coin.
With increasing $W$, we also observe that fluctuations are introduced to the entanglement entropy.
%
Interestingly, these fluctuations do not vanish upon increasing the number of disorder realizations. 
We may understand these oscillations as further indicator for a localization phenomenon taking place.
This is because the quantum state cannot be immobile since only those sites can be occupied that
coincide with the time parity (even, odd). Hence, even a state that we consider localized will alter 
between even and odd time steps. The stronger the disorder, the faster the localization occurs such that 
even and odd states may be picked from the initial transient regime and thus show a significantly 
distinct entanglement character. Hence, the EE for even (odd) steps is rather constant (see
inset in Fig.~\ref{fig:EE}) but the localization
prevents further approaching a unique EE as it is the case for the Hadamard walk.

For $W>0$, we trace out the walker degrees of freedom for each disorder realization 
and evaluate the resulting EE. The results are averaged over $1000$ independent disorder realizations.
With increasing $W$ oscillations emerge that further support the localization hypothesis. The inset shows 
that the EE is rather constant for even (odd) time steps.}
\label{fig:EE}
\end{figure}
% I feel the figures are too small when putting two of them in a line. Could we just have on figure a line?
%
%

To further investigate the entanglement properties of the CQW with coin disorder, we consider the ensemble 
of realizations. The resulting mixed state $\rho$ is the accurate description of the bipartite quantum system and 
not pure. An entanglement witness for such mixed states is the entanglement negativity which 
is defined as~\cite{Per96}
%
%
\begin{align}
    \mathcal{N} = -\frac{1}{2}\left(1-\sum_{i}|\lambda_i'|\right).
\end{align}
%
%
Here, $\lambda_i'$ are the eigenvalues of the partial transpose $\rho'$ of 
the density matrix $\rho$, viz.,
%
\begin{align}
    \rho'_{x\sigma,x'\sigma'} = \rho_{x\sigma',x'\sigma}
\end{align}
%
with $x,x'\in \mathbb{Z}$ and $\sigma,\sigma' \in \{\up,\down\}$. 
Naturally, if $\rho$ can be written as a sum of 
product states of individual subsystem density matrices
% of density matrices of the
% subsystem (i.e., unentangled states) 
so can $\rho'$. The normalization $\operatorname{tr}\rho = 1$
is carried over to $\rho'$ such that $\sum_i \lambda_i' = 1$. Thus, in the case that 
$\rho'$ is a sum of product states all $\lambda_i'\geq 0$ such that 
$\sum_i |\lambda_i'| = 1$ and consequently $\mathcal{N} = 0$.
Any negative eigenvalue will indicate a non-separable quantum state and thus
the presence of entanglement. In this case $\sum_i |\lambda_i'| >1$ and thus $\mathcal{N}>0$.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:neg} we show our results for the entanglement negativity for the CQW with coin 
disorder.
%
\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.95\columnwidth]{N_wide.pdf}
\caption{{\bf Entanglement negativity.} For different values of the coin disorder $W$, we depict the
entanglement negativity between coin and quantum walker. For $W=0$, we observe $\mathcal{N} \simeq 0.45$ 
for large times clearly indicating an entangled quantum state. Conversely, for $W>0$ we see 
$\mathcal{N} \to 0$. We consider $1000$ independent disorder realizations.}
\label{fig:neg}
\end{figure}
%
For the Hadamard walk, we recover the established behavior of the negativity~\cite{Maloyer_2007}: following 
an initial transient regime, $\mathcal{N}$ settles to a constant value and remains finite. For $W>0$
we observe that the negativity decays over time hinting at an absence of entanglement in the ensemble 
of initializations. We stress that this does not mean that the quantum state is not entangled but we may
understand the vanishing of $\mathcal{N}$ as an indication that the quantum state is `more separable'.
This again supports the argument that the quantum walker undergoes localization: if the state was 
separable, then the walker state is unaffected by coin state yielding an effectively frozen walker.

\section{Alternative boundary conditions}
\label{sec:bcs}

For late times, the linear spreading of the light cone makes computational advances
increasingly challenging since the Hilbert space dimension increases rapidly. 
Alternative boundary conditions such as periodic or reflective boundary conditions
naturally limit the Hilbert space dimension and allow more straightforward computational 
approaches. Here we complement our analysis by considering some
properties of the CQW with coin disorder for periodic and reflective boundary conditions.



{\it Periodic boundary conditions}. 
%
\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{mixing_ratio_periodic_wide.pdf}\\
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{mean_square_displacement_periodic_wide.pdf}
    \caption{{\bf Periodic boundary conditions.}
    We consider the CQW with quenched coin disorder
    and periodic boundary conditions. To this 
    end we consider a circle with a total of $61$ sites and average over $1000$ independent
    disorder realizations.}
    \label{fig:periodic}
\end{figure}
% 
In Fig.~\ref{fig:periodic} we show the mixing ratio as well as
the mean squared displacement for a system of $61$ sites ($30$ sites in positive and negative direction 
respectively). First, we note that the definition of the flat distribution must be altered to 
evaluate meaningful mixing ratios. This is because the periodic boundary conditions break the even - odd
parity of the CQW due to the boundary hopping which corresponds to an even - even transition. Hence, 
we compare the walker probability distribution with $p_{\rm flat}^{\rm (r)} (x) = 1/L$ where $L$ is 
the total number of sites. For the Hadamard walk ($W=0$), the initial state (see Eq.~(\ref{eq:initial})) is 
far away from $p_{\rm flat}^{\rm (r)}$ and mixing occurs rather fast. Around $t \approx 100 = 
\mathcal{O}(L)$
the mixing ratio peaks since the two ballistic peaks meet and interfere constructively. The spreading
of the peaks with time eventually yields rather constant oscillations and a rather strong mixing.
For small disorder strengths (e.g., $W=0.2$), we see that the CQW mixes better and oscillations are 
notably absent again hinting at a localized state. Upon increasing $W$, we observe that states become less
mixed as we would expect since a single, prominent peak is forming. This is supported by the results 
for the mean squared displacement. For this finite system, there is a natural upper bound and for 
each disorder strength $W>0$, $\langle x^2 \rangle$ saturates at a level below that of the Hadamard walk.



{\it Reflective boundary conditions}.
In Fig.~\ref{fig:reflective} we show the analogous results to 
Fig.~\ref{fig:periodic} but with reflective boundary conditions. Importantly, reflective boundary conditions again preserve the 
even - odd parity of the CQW but as for the periodic boundary conditions we do not rely on a light cone distribution since the system is finite. 
Qualitatively, the results for reflective boundary conditions 
coincide with those of periodic boundary conditions although the absolute values of mixing and 
mean squared displacement vary slightly.

\section{Conclusion \& Outlook}
\label{sec:conclusion}
The Hadamard walk - often referred to as quantum analogue of the classical random walk - is a well-studied system
that has been considered in a variety of different setups. Here, we addressed the question how 
quenched disorder in the coin operations influences CQWs. First, we observed 
clear differences in the quantum 
walker occupation probability: While for the Hadamard walk the occupation probability is characterized by two
ballistically travelling peaks, the coin disorder hinders this ballistic spreading. Instead we observed
dynamics that is significantly slowed down as evidenced by the mixing ratio and the 
state fidelity. In particular, we see that a new centre peak emerges that becomes the asymptotically 
dominating feature of the occupation probability signaling walker localization. This 
is supported by an analysis of the mean squared displacement that reveals a sublogarithmic growth
as opposed to a quadratic growth for the Hadamard walk or a linear growth for classical diffusion. Hence, the 
underlying dynamics is extremely slow and since the leading behavior of $\langle x^2 \rangle$ is not 
algebraic we contemplate that the walker localizes.

Next, we considered the entanglement behavior between the quantum coin and the walker.
Here, we presented two separate approaches the results of 
which point in the same direction. First, we studied the EE. We considered individual 
realizations of the CQW and averaged the EE of each realizations.
% because the EE is only a faithful
% entanglement witness for pure states and the ensemble that emerges from different realizations 
% is not pure. 
We found that the disorder lowers the average EE per run with increasing disorder.
Interestingly we also observed that, with increasing disorder strength 
$W$, the EE shows oscillations that do not decrease
upon increasing the number of disorder realizations. Rather these oscillations are a further indicator 
of localization in the CQW in the following sense. For $W>0$, the walker state is frozen and 
the larger $W$ the faster this happens. But the walker state cannot be equal at all times since the 
system as we have set it up has an underlying even - odd parity. Hence, the system alternates between
two distinct states and these states differ in their entanglement properties yielding increasing 
oscillations for increasing $W$ as the localization happens earlier in the transient regime.

Conversely, to quantify the entanglement properties of the ensemble of realizations, we considered 
the entanglement negativity. The negativity $\mathcal{N}$
is a faithful entanglement quantifier for mixed states but from $\mathcal{N} = 0$ one cannot automatically
deduce that there is no entanglement present in the system. The negativity for the standard Hadamard walk 
quickly converges to a finite value ${\cal N} > 0$ indicating that the state of the composite quantum 
system at late times is strongly entangled. Upon introducing coin disorder, we observed 
that the negativity quickly decays to zero hinting at a quantum state for the composite system that 
might be separable or for which entanglement is at least not a dominating feature. This would imply that
the quantum coin state does not significantly influence the walker state. Hence, since the coin induces
the walker dynamics, we may interpret this as a further indicator for a walker localization.

Despite the apparent simplicity of CQWs, there are a variety of directions with interesting research 
avenues to explore. For example, it would be interesting to further explore the interplay between 
disorder and coin-walker entanglement in the current setup. One might, e.g., consider different initial
conditions that are entangled to varying degrees and see how the disorder affects the entanglement 
over time. Along these lines, one might as well consider a stochastic resetting~\cite{Rose18,Wald21}. This 
could potentially allow to inject entanglement back in the system and might yield a more entangled 
steady state whose localization properties need to be explored carefully.
It would also be interesting to study quenched coin disorder for different topologies. 
Here, one might consider higher dimensional regular lattices or complex networks with higher connectivity.
In these more complicated setups, it might be that localization requires a minimal amount of 
disorder $W>0$. 
In this context, it would be also interesting to explore connections
between disordered CQWs and quantum Hall systems. 
This could be done by linking CQWs with the Chalker-Coddington model~\cite{Chalker88} and 
studying renormalization group approaches to CQWs that have been previously
used in quantum Hall systems, see, e.g., Ref.~\cite{Cain05}.

\label{fig:HW_ana_num}
\end{figure*}

Here, we briefly outline the analytical solution of the Hadamard walk, following 
Ref.~\cite{nayak2000quantum}. We write 
% 
% 
\begin{align}
\ket{\psi} &=\sum_x \left(\psi_{x,\down} \ket{\down}+\psi_{x,\up} \ket{\up}\right)\ket{x}
= \sum_{x} \ket{\vec{\psi}_x} \ket{x} 
\end{align}
% 
% 
with the two component vectors $\ket{\vec{\psi}_x} = (\psi_{x,\down},\psi_{x,\up})$.
This allows us to decompose the Hadamard gate into its row components and 
deduce the recursion relation
%
%
\begin{align}
    \ket{\vec{\psi}_x(t+1)} = 
    J_+
    \ket{\vec{\psi}_{x-1}(t)}
    +
    J_-
    \ket{\vec{\psi}_{x+1}(t)},
\end{align}
%
%
with the matrices
%
%
\begin{align}
    J_+ = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
    0&0\\
    \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}&-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
    \end{pmatrix},
    \quad
    J_- = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
    \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}&\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\\
    0&0
    \end{pmatrix},
\end{align}
such that $H=J_+ + J_-$. Apparently the Hadamard walk is translation-invariant such that we may transform 
the recursion relation into Fourier space, viz.,
%
%
\begin{align}
 \ket{\Tilde{\vec{\psi}}_k(t)} = 
 \sum_{x} \ket{\vec{\psi}_x(t)} e^{\II k x}.
\end{align}
%
%
This yields the recursion relation in Fourier space
%
%
\begin{align}
    \ket{\Tilde{\vec{\psi}}_k(t+1)}
    % &= \sum_{x} \vec{\Psi}_x(t+1) e^{i k x}\\
    % &= \sum_{x}\left(J_+ \vec{\Psi}_{x-1}(t)+J_-\vec{\Psi}_{x+1}(t)\right) e^{i k x}\\
    % &= \left(J_+ e^{i k} +J_- e^{-i k}\right) \ket{\Tilde{\vec{\psi}}_k(t)}\\
    &= \mathcal{J}_k \ket{\Tilde{\vec{\psi}}_k(t)}.
\end{align}
%
%
Thus, $\mathcal{J}_k\equiv J_+ e^{\II k} +J_- e^{-\II k}$
generates the discrete time evolution of the corresponding Fourier 
component such that $\ket{\Tilde{\vec{\psi}}_k(t)} = \mathcal{J}_k^t \ket{\Tilde{\vec{\psi}}_k(0)}$.
In order to fully determine the dynamics of the Fourier modes it suffices to diagonalize the 
$2\times 2$ matrix $\mathcal{J}_k$. The eigenvalues are readily found, viz.,
%
%
\begin{align}
\lambda_{\pm} 
= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(\pm \sqrt{1+\cos^2(k)} - \II \sin(k)\right).
\end{align}
%
%
Since $\mathcal{J}_k$ is unitary, $\lambda_\pm$ lay on the unit circle in 
the complex plane and we further observe $\lambda_+ = -\lambda_-^*$. Hence 
we may write
$\lambda_+ = e^{-\II \omega_k}$ and $\lambda_- = e^{\II(\pi +\omega_k)}$ with
$\sin\omega_k =\sin(k)/\sqrt{2}$.
%
%
% \begin{align}
%     \lambda_+ = e^{-i\omega_k}, \quad \lambda_- = e^{\II(\pi +\omega_k)}, \quad 
%    \sin\omega_k = \frac{\sin k}{\sqrt{2}}.
% \end{align}
% %
%
The corresponding eigenvectors $\ket{\pm}$ can be found from a straightforward but lengthy calculation, viz.,
%
%
\begin{align}
    \ket{\pm} &= %\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} 
     \sqrt{ \frac{1}{2}\pm\frac{\cos k}{2\sqrt{1+\cos^2 k}} }
    \begin{pmatrix}
        e^{- \II k}\\
        \pm\sqrt{2}e^{\mp \II\omega} - e^{-\II k}
    \end{pmatrix},
    % \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
    % \frac{\left(e^{-ik}, \sqrt{2}e^{-i\omega} - e^{-ik} \right)^t}{
    % \sqrt{ 1+\cos^2 k - \cos k\sqrt{1+\cos^2k} }}
%     \ket{+} &= 
%     \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{ 1+\frac{\cos k}{\sqrt{1+\cos^2 k}} }
%     \begin{pmatrix}
%         e^{-i k}\\
%         \sqrt{2}e^{-i\omega} - e^{-ik}
%     \end{pmatrix},
%     % \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
%     % \frac{\left(e^{-ik}, \sqrt{2}e^{-i\omega} - e^{-ik} \right)^t}{
%     % \sqrt{ 1+\cos^2 k - \cos k\sqrt{1+\cos^2k} }}
%     \\
% %    
%     \ket{-} &= 
%     \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\sqrt{1-\frac{\cos k}{\sqrt{1+\cos^2k}}}
%     \begin{pmatrix}
%         e^{-ik}\\
%         -\sqrt{2}e^{i\omega} - e^{-ik}
%     \end{pmatrix}.
%     % \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
%     % \frac{\left(e^{-ik}, -\sqrt{2}e^{-i\omega} - e^{-ik} \right)^t}{
%     % \sqrt{ 1+\cos^2 k + \cos k\sqrt{1+\cos^2k} }}   
\end{align}
%
%
Hence, we may write $\mathcal{J}_k = \sum_{\sigma=\pm} \lambda_\sigma \ket{\sigma}\bra{\sigma}$ and the 
time evolution can be explicitly recovered as 
\begin{align}
    \ket{\vec{\Tilde{\psi}}_k(t)} = \lambda_+^t \ket{+}\braket{+|\vec{\Tilde{\psi}}_k(0)}
    +\lambda_-^t \ket{-}\braket{-|\vec{\Tilde{\psi}}_k(0)}.
\end{align}
% 
% 
For an arbitrary initial coin state $\ket{\Tilde{\vec\Psi}_k (0)} = (a,b)$ we may then write the
time evolved state explicitly in Fourier space as
% 
% 
\begin{widetext}
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
    \Tilde{\psi}_k^\down(t) &= 
     \frac{a}{2}\Bigg[
     \left(1+\frac{\cos k}{\sqrt{1+\cos^2k}}\right)e^{-\II\omega_k t}
     +(-1)^t\left(1-\frac{\cos k}{\sqrt{1+\cos^2k}}\right)e^{\II\omega_k t}
     \Bigg]
     +\frac{b}{2} e^{-\II k} \frac{e^{-\II\omega_k t} -(-1)^t e^{\II\omega_k t}}{\sqrt{1+\cos^2k}},
    \\[.5cm]
    %
    \Tilde{\psi}_k^\up(t) &= 
    \frac{a}{2}e^{\II k}\frac{e^{-\II\omega_kt} - (-1)^t e^{\II\omega_k t}}{\sqrt{1+\cos^2 k}}
    +\frac{b}{2} \Bigg[
    \left(1-\frac{\cos k}{\sqrt{1+\cos^2 k}}\right)e^{-\II\omega_k t}
    +(-1)^t\left(1+\frac{\cos k}{\sqrt{1+\cos^2 k}}\right)e^{\II\omega_k t}
    \Bigg].
    %
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
% \hl{above should be correct now. double check!!}
% \end{widetext}

These Fourier expressions can be readily translated into real space in order to obtain
the walker probability distribution and deduce related quantities such as the mixing ratio. We find

%%i think we can use just a single widtext block and inlcude the above sentence in the widtext block.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:HW_ana_num} we compare the occupation probability of the walker obtained from the 
analytical solution to that of the numerical solution for different time steps and we observe 
perfect agreement.

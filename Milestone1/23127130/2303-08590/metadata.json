    "abstract": "This paper addresses different aspects of \"coupled\" model descriptions in computational electromagnetics. This includes domain decomposition, multiscale problems, multiple or hybrid discrete field formulation and multi-physics problems. Theoretical issues of accuracy, stability and numerical efficiency of the resulting formulations are addressed along with advantages and disadvantages of the various approaches. Examples for multi-method, multi-domain, multi-formulation and multi-physics coupled formulations stem from numerical testing of electromagnetic compatibility in complex scenarios and numerical dosimetry of biological organisms in electromagnetic exposure situations and from simulations of large systems in electromagnetic power transmission.",

abstract = {Conventional imaging systems rely upon illumination light that is scattered or transmitted by the object and subsequently imaged. Ghost-imaging systems based on parametric down-conversion use twin beams of position-correlated signal and idler photons. One beam illuminates an object while the image information is recovered from a second beam that has never interacted with the object. In this Letter, we report on a camera-based ghost imaging system where the correlated photons have significantly different wavelengths. Infrared photons at 1550\&\#xA0;nm wavelength illuminate the object and are detected by an InGaAs/InP single-photon avalanche diode. The image data are recorded from the coincidently detected, position-correlated, visible photons at a wavelength of 460\&\#xA0;nm using a highly efficient, low-noise, photon-counting camera. The efficient transfer of the image information from infrared illumination to visible detection wavelengths and the ability to count single photons allows the acquisition of an image while illuminating the object with an optical power density of only 100\&\#x2009;\&\#x2009;pJ\&\#x2009;cm\&\#x2212;2\&\#x2009;s\&\#x2212;1. This wavelength-transforming ghost-imaging technique has potential for the imaging of light-sensitive specimens or where covert operation is desired.},

ABSTRACT = {Plenoptic imaging is a novel optical technique for three-dimensional imaging in a single shot. It is enabled by the simultaneous measurement of both the location and the propagation direction of light in a given scene. In the standard approach, the maximum spatial and angular resolutions are inversely proportional, and so are the resolution and the maximum achievable depth of focus of the 3D image. We have recently proposed a method to overcome such fundamental limits by combining plenoptic imaging with an intriguing correlation remote-imaging technique: ghost imaging. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that correlation plenoptic imaging can be effectively achieved by exploiting the position-momentum entanglement characterizing spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) photon pairs. As a proof-of-principle demonstration, we shall show that correlation plenoptic imaging with entangled photons may enable the refocusing of an out-of-focus image at the same depth of focus of a standard plenoptic device, but without sacrificing diffraction-limited image resolution.},

abstract = {Abstract Acquiring information at the fastest possible rate is often desirable, particularly in quantum ghost imaging which suffers from slow reconstruction speeds. Many computationally intense deep-learning methods have been implemented in an effort to speed up image acquisition times by retrieving image information. Often over-looked, machine learning methods can offer the same, if not better, speed up in image acquisition time by an object recognition process. Four machine learning algorithms are implemented and trained on a uniquely generated, noised, and blurred dataset of numerical digits 1 through 9. Of the tested recognition algorithms, logistic regression shows a 10× speed up in image acquisition time with a 99\% prediction accuracy. Additionally, this reduction in acquisition time is achieved without any image denoising or enhancement prior to recognition, thereby reducing training and implementation time, as well as the computational intensity of the approach. This method can be implemented in real-time, requiring only 1/10th of the measurements needed for a general solution, making it ideal for quantum imaging and recognition of light sensitive structure.},

The spectrum of the sample was measured by counting the coincidences when signal photons go through the impurity crystal, whilst the wavelength of the idler photons is resolved by a monochromator. A strongly nondegenerate regime of SPDC, when the difference in frequencies of correlated photons exceeds significantly their spectral width, was used in the biphoton spectroscopy for the first time. Such a regime allows one to obtain an absorption spectrum by measuring the wavelength in a completely different spectral range.}

ABSTRACT = {In spite of the wide use of Raman spectroscopy for chemical analysis in different fields, not any automated identification of Raman spectra is universally adopted. However, the interest in this field is witnessed by the large number of papers published in the last decades. The problem of Raman-spectra classification becomes particularly challenging when low irradiation is requested, either for safety reasons or to avoid target photodegradation. This often leads to spectra characterized by a low signal-to-noise ratio, where methods based on correlation usually fail. For this reason, a method based on peak identification through FMFs is presented, discussed and validated over a large set of samples. In particular, a Monte Carlo simulation has been employed to determine the best parameters of the fuzzy membership functions based on the analysis of performances of the classification procedure. The ROC curves have been analyzed, and AUC and best accuracy are employed as key parameters to evaluate the classification performances on different amounts of ammonium nitrate (from 300 to 1500 &mu;g) and different laser exposure levels (from 3.1 to 250 mJ/cm2).},

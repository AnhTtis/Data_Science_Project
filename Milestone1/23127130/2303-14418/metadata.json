    "abstract": "We investigate the effect of superradiance shielding for the analogue rotating black holes simulated by optical vortices by calculating the radial motion of massless particles in such spacetime background. We add the conditions $E<LΩ_{r_{e}}$ and $L>0$ to judge the classically forbidden region of superradiance. It is found that the superradiance forbidden region exists near the static limit inside the ergosphere,which will limit the classical Penrose process for the particles with some specific energies and angular momenta. Once these particles satisfying the superradiance conditions aremeasured at the outside of the ergosphere, this shows that the Penrose process can be quantum.",

\section{Discussion}
LayoutDM is based on diffusion models for discrete state-space.
Using continuous state-space as in latent diffusion models~\cite{rombach2022high} would be interesting. Extension of LayoutDM to handle various layout properties such as color~\cite{kikuchi2023generative} and image/text~\cite{yamaguchi2021canvasvae} is also appealing.

We believe our proposed logit adjustment can incorporate more attributes.
Attribute-conditional LayoutGAN~\cite{li2020attribute} considers area, aspect ratio, and reading order of elements for fine-grained control. Since these attributes can be easily converted to the size and location relationship constraints, incorporating them with our LayoutDM is not very difficult.

\paragraph{Potential negative impact}
Our model might be used to automatically generate the basic structure of fake websites or mobile applications, which could lead to scams or the spreading of misinformation.

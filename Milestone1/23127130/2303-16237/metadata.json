    "abstract": "In a graph $G$ with a vertex coloring $c$, a path of $2k$ vertices $\\{v_1,\\cdots,v_k,v_{k+1},\\cdots,v_{2k}\\}$ is called repetitive if $c(v_i)=c(v_{k+i})$ for all $1\\le i\\le k$. We call $c$ a non-repetitive coloring if for any $k\\in\\mathbb{N}$, all paths of $2k$ vertices are non-repetitive.\n  In this paper, our main focus is to study the non-repetitive coloring of the Cartesian product of graphs. In particular, we prove that the grid $P\\square P$ can be 12-nonrepetitively colored, where the previous best result was 16.",

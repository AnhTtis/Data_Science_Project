    "abstract": "When granular mixtures of different sizes are fluidized, each species spontaneously separates and condenses to form patterns. Although granular segregation has been extensively studied, the inability to directly observe the time evolution of the internal structure hinders the understanding of the mechanism of segregation dynamics driven by surface flow. In this study, we report rich band dynamics, including a self-replicating band, in a horizontally shaken granular mixture in a quasi-two-dimensional container where the granules formed steady surface waves. Direct observation of surface flow and segregated internal structure revealed that coupling among segregation, surface flow, and hysteresis in the fluidity of granules is key to understanding complex band dynamics.",

    "abstract": "This paper establishes sharp local regularity estimates for viscosity solutions of fully nonlinear parabolic free boundary problems with singular absorption terms. The main difficulties are due to the blow-up of the source along the free boundary and the lack of a variational structure. The proof combines the power of the Ishii-Lions method with intrinsically parabolic oscillation estimates. The results are new, even for second-order linear operators in nondivergence form.",

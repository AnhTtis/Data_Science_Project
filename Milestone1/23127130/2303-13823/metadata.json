    "abstract": "We consider a hybrid system that is established by the direct interaction between a magnon and a superconducting transmon qubit. Through weakly driving the magnon and probing the qubit, a high-degree magnon blockade can be realized, which paves a revenue toward quantum manipulation at the level of a single magnon. Our magnon-blockade proposal is optimized when the magnon-qubit transversal coupling strength is equivalent to the detuning of the qubit and the probing field or that of the magnon and the driving field. Under this condition, the analytical expression of the equal-time second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$ can be minimized when the probing intensity is about three times of the driving intensity. Moreover, the degree of the magnon blockade could be further enhanced by choosing proper driving intensity and system decay rate. With experimental-relevant parameters, the correlation function attains $g^{(2)}(0)\\sim10^{-7}$, about two orders lower than that for the photon blockade in cavity optomechanical systems. Also we discuss the effects on $g^{(2)}(0)$ from the thermal noise on magnon and qubit and the extra longitudinal interaction between the two components. Our optimized conditions for blockade still hold in both nonideal situations.",

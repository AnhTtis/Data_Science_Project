    "abstract": "This paper deals with unbounded solutions to a class of chemotaxis systems. In particular, for a rather general attraction-repulsion model, with nonlinear productions, diffusion, sensitivities and logistic term, we detect Lebesgue spaces where given unbounded solutions blow-up also in the corresponding norms of those spaces; subsequently, estimates for the blow-up time are established. Finally, for a simplified version of the model, some blow-up criteria are proved.",

    "abstract": "The study of defect phases is important for designing nanostructured metals and alloys. Grain boundaries (GBs) form one class of defects that directly influence materials properties, such as deformability and strength. At the same time, alloying can introduce GB phase transformations and can therewith alter mechanical performance. In this work, the defect phases of a $Σ$7 $(12\\bar{3}0)$ [0001] 21.78$^\\circ$ symmetric tilt GB in hcp Mg are investigated. Ab-initio simulations as a function of stress and temperature (using quasi-harmonic approximation) are performed, and different types of phase transformations are revealed. To this end, the influence of the chemical degree of freedom on the defect phases is studied for the example of Ga addition, using an efficient screening approach that combines empirical potentials and accurate ab-initio calculations. By exploiting the concept of defect phase diagrams, a phase transformation from the T to the A structural type and as well as a systematic transition of the segregation site preference is revealed. The results qualitatively agree well with experimental observations from scanning transition electron microscopy. The underlying physical mechanisms have an impact on grain-boundary engineering in metallic alloys.",

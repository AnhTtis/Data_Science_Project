    "abstract": "Digital image correlation (DIC) has become a valuable tool in the evaluation of mechanical experiments, particularly fatigue crack growth experiments. The evaluation requires accurate information of the crack path and crack tip position, which is difficult to obtain due to inherent noise and artefacts. Machine learning models have been extremely successful in recognizing this relevant information. But for the training of robust models, which generalize well, big data is needed. However, data is typically scarce in the field of material science and engineering because experiments are expensive and time-consuming. We present a method to generate synthetic DIC data using generative adversarial networks with a physics-guided discriminator. To decide whether data samples are real or fake, this discriminator additionally receives the derived von Mises equivalent strain. We show that this physics-guided approach leads to improved results in terms of visual quality of samples, sliced Wasserstein distance, and geometry score.",

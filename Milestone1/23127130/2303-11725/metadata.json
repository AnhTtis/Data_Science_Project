    "abstract": "Modern robotic platforms need a reliable localization system to operate daily beside humans. Simple pose estimation algorithms based on filtered wheel and inertial odometry often fail in the presence of abrupt kinematic changes and wheel slips. Moreover, despite the recent success of visual odometry, service and assistive robotic tasks often present challenging environmental conditions where visual-based solutions fail due to poor lighting or repetitive feature patterns. In this work, we propose an innovative online learning approach for wheel odometry correction, paving the way for a robust multi-source localization system. An efficient attention-based neural network architecture has been studied to combine precise performances with real-time inference. The proposed solution shows remarkable results compared to a standard neural network and filter-based odometry correction algorithms. Nonetheless, the online learning paradigm avoids the time-consuming data collection procedure and can be adopted on a generic robotic platform on-the-fly.",

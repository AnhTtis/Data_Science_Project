    "abstract": "A discrete quantum process is represented by a sequence of quantum operations, which are completely positive maps that are not necessarily trace preserving. We consider quantum processes that are obtained by repeated iterations of a quantum operation with noise. Such ergodic quantum processes generalize independent quantum processes. An ergodic theorem describing convergence to equilibrium for a general class of such processes was recently obtained by Movassagh and Schenker. Under irreducibility and mixing conditions, we obtain a central limit type theorem describing fluctuations around the ergodic limit.",

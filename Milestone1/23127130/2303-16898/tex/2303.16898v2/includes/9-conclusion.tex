\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

In this paper, we propose an approach for bagging by singulating layers using interactive perception. %Experiments show that \bagging achieves significantly higher success rates over baselines for opening a bag, inserting items, and lifting the bag. In future work, we plan to apply this approach to related tasks such as packing and wrapping. 
Future directions include speeding up the pipeline, applying the approach to related tasks such as packing and wrapping, and studying scenarios where two sides of the bag stick together tightly. 


%We hope that this work will lead to an exciting era in robotic manipulation of bags and 3D deformable objects more generally.

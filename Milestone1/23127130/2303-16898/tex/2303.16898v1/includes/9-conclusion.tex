\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

In this paper, we propose an approach for bagging by singulating layers using interactive perception. Experiments show that \bagging achieves significantly higher success rates over baselines for opening a bag, inserting items, and lifting the bag. In future work, we plan to apply this approach to related tasks such as packing and wrapping. 

%We hope that this work will lead to an exciting era in robotic manipulation of bags and 3D deformable objects more generally.

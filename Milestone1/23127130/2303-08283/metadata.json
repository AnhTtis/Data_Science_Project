    "abstract": "Reversible covalent or supramolecular bonds play an important role in materials science and in biological systems. The equilibrium between open and closed bonds and the association rate can be controlled thermally, chemically, by mechanical pulling, ultrasound or catalysts. In practice, these intrinsic equilibrium methods either suffer from a limited range of tunability or may damage the system. Here, we present a non-equilibrium strategy that exploits the dissipative properties of the system to control and change the dynamic properties of sacrificial and reversible networks. We show theoretically and numerically how high-frequency mechanical oscillations of very low amplitude can open or close bonds. This mechanism indicates how reversible bonds could alleviate mechanical fatigue of materials especially at low temperatures where they are fragile. In another area, it suggests that the system can be actively modified by the application of ultrasound to induce gel-fluid transitions and to activate or deactivate adhesion properties.",

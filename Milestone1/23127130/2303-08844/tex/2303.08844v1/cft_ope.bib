Their basic property is their invariance under an infinite-dimensional group of conformal (analytic) transformations. It is shown that the local fields forming the operator algebra can be classified according to the irreducible representations of Virasoro algebra, and that the correlation functions are built up of the “conformal blocks” which are completely determined by the conformal invariance. Exactly solvable conformal theories associated with the degenerate representations are analyzed. In these theories the anomalous dimensions are known exactly and the correlation functions satisfy the systems of linear differential equations.}

abstract = {We review results concerning the critical behavior of spin systems at equilibrium. We consider the Ising and the general O(N)-symmetric universality classes, including the N→0 limit that describes the critical behavior of self-avoiding walks. For each of them, we review the estimates of the critical exponents, of the equation of state, of several amplitude ratios, and of the two-point function of the order parameter. We report results in three and two dimensions. We discuss the crossover phenomena that are observed in this class of systems. In particular, we review the field-theoretical and numerical studies of systems with medium-range interactions. Moreover, we consider several examples of magnetic and structural phase transitions, which are described by more complex Landau–Ginzburg–Wilson Hamiltonians, such as N-component systems with cubic anisotropy, O(N)-symmetric systems in the presence of quenched disorder, frustrated spin systems with noncollinear or canted order, and finally, a class of systems described by the tetragonal Landau–Ginzburg–Wilson Hamiltonian with three quartic couplings. The results for the tetragonal Hamiltonian are original, in particular we present the six-loop perturbative series for the β-functions. Finally, we consider a Hamiltonian with symmetry O(n1)⊕O(n2) that is relevant for the description of multicritical phenomena.}

abstract = {The massless regime of the quantum XXZ chain is an example of a conformally invariant (1 + 1)-dimensional Hamiltonian with conformal anomaly c = 1. In this paper, Bethe ansatz equations are formulated and solved numerically for eigenstates of the XXZ Hamiltonian on a finite chain with periodic boundary conditions and with a generalized class of “twisted” boundary conditions. The resulting spectra are found to be in accord with predictions of conformal invariance and the corresponding operator content is identified. With periodic boundary conditions, eight-vertex and Gaussian model operators are found. With the twisted boundary conditions, operators from the operator algebras of the Ashkin-Teller and q-state Potts models are identified. This identification is achieved by constructing exact equivalences between eigenergies of the quantum Ashkin-Teller and Potts Hamiltonians with periodic boundary conditions and levels of the XXZ Hamiltonian with modified boundary conditions. In the Potts case, states in the ground-state sector correspond exactly to states of the XXZ chain with a “defect seam.” The effect of this seam on the ground-state energy is shown to generate the conformal anomaly of the Potts model. For the 4-state model, the XXZ equivalence is used to perform very large lattice calculations and, thereby, to obtain direct confirmation of the expected values for its critical exponents. Finally, the leading finite-size corrections to the predictions of conformal invariance are analyzed and the dominant irrelevant operators governing these corrections identified.}

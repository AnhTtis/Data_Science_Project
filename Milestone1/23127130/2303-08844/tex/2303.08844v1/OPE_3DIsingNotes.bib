@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note="One complication is, these simulations were done on the geometry $T^3$ or $T^2\times R$, for which the famous three-point conformal correlator is valid only when the distances $x_{ij}$ of operators are well separated from the UV (i.e. lattice spacing) and IR scale (system size), namely $1\ll x_{ij} \ll L$."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note2,key="Note2",note=" We recall that the electron number $N=2s+1$ plays the role of space volume, i.e. $N\sim R^2$. So in the numerical analysis we will just use $\protect \sqrt  {N}$ as the radius of sphere."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note3,key="Note3",note="$O_\epsilon (\protect \bm  {\Omega })$ gives an identical result as $n^x(\protect \bm  {\Omega })$ (up to a factor) as they differ by the Hamiltonian density."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note4,key="Note4",note="We note that usually the OPE involving two or three spinning primaries could have more than one independent tensor structures (i.e. OPE coefficients), but $f_{T_{\mu \nu } T_{\rho \eta }\epsilon }$ has only one independent tensor structure due to the conservation of $T_{\mu \nu }$~\cite {EMT_boot}. So it is enough to evaluate Eq.~\protect \textup  {\hbox {\mathsurround \z@ \protect \normalfont  (\ignorespaces \ref {eq:TTepsilon}\unskip \@@italiccorr )}}, but one may have to perform a basis transformation to compare $f_{T_{\mu \nu } T_{\rho \eta }\epsilon }$ computed in other (linear dependent) tensor structure."}

    "abstract": "It is well known that, under some assumptions, the limit distribution of random block matrices and their partial transposition converges to the distributions of random variables in some noncommutative probability space. Using free probability theory, we obtain the relation between the free cumulants of the corresponding random variables. As an application, we are able to derive a new family of co-completely positive and k-positive maps by using the Wishart ensemble.",

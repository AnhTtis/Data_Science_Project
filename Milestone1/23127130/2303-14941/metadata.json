    "abstract": "In this work, we consider a first order mean field games system with non-local couplings. A Lagrange-Galerkin scheme for the continuity equation, coupled with a semi-Lagrangian scheme for the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, is proposed to discretize the mean field games system. The convergence of solutions to the scheme towards a solution to the mean field game system is established in arbitrary space dimensions. The scheme is implemented to approximate two mean field games systems in dimension one and two.",

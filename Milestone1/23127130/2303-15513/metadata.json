    "abstract": "The resonantly produced sterile neutrino ($N_1$) of the neutrino minimal standard model ($ν$MSM) is a compelling dark matter candidate, especially in the reported possible detection of $N_1$ with mass $m_\\mathrm{s}=7.1$~keV in X-ray decay. This particle will be accessible to the XRISM X-ray mission over the next 12 months. We revisit the physics behind $N_1$ and the uncertainty in its parameters. We compare predictions for the $m_\\mathrm{s}=7.1$keV $N_1$ mixing angle, $\\sin^{2}(2θ)$, and half-mode mass, $M_\\mathrm{hm}$, to existing X-ray observations and structure formation constraints. The strongest available constraints rule out $N_1$ as a dark matter candidate, and a more optimistic reading of the data prefers $\\sin^{2}(2θ)=5\\times10^{-11}$ and $M_\\mathrm{hm}=3.5\\times10^{8}$$\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$. We highlight that the most promising upcoming opportunity for a detection is to find a line of velocity dispersion $\\sim500$$\\mathrm{kms^{-1}}$ in the Virgo cluster with XRISM, and then draw up a list of future objects of study to determine: (i) whether the line is from dark matter generally, and (ii) if from dark matter, whether that candidate is indeed $N_1$.",

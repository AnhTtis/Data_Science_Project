    "abstract": "This report details the design, development, and implementation of IncidentUI, an Android tablet application designed to measure user-experienced ride comfort and record disengagement data for autonomous vehicles (AV) during test drives. The goal of our project was to develop an Android application to run on a peripheral tablet and communicate with the Drive Pegasus AGX, the AI Computing Platform for Nvidia's AV Level 2 Autonomy Solution Architecture [1], to detect AV disengagements and report ride comfort. We designed and developed an Android XML-based intuitive user interface for IncidentUI. The development of IncidentUI required a redesign of the system architecture by redeveloping the system communications protocol in Java and implementing the Protocol Buffers (Protobufs) in Java using the existing system Protobuf definitions. The final iteration of IncidentUI yielded the desired functionality while testing on an AV test drive. We also received positive feedback from Nvidia's AV Platform Team during our final IncidentUI demonstration.",

    "abstract": "In quantum field theory, the Dyson-Schwinger equations are an infinite set of coupled equations relating $n$-point Green's functions in a self-consistent manner. They have found important applications in non-perturbative studies, ranging from quantum chromodynamics and hadron physics to strongly correlated electron systems. However, they are notoriously formidable to solve. One of the main problems is that a finite truncation of the infinite system is underdetermined. Recently, Bender et al. [PRL 130, 101602 (2023)] proposed to make use of the large-$n$ asymptotic behaviors and successfully obtained accurate results in $D=0$ spacetime. At higher $D$, it seems more difficult to deduce the large-$n$ behaviors. In this paper, we propose another avenue in light of the null bootstrap. The underdetermined system is solved by imposing the null state condition. This approach can be extended to $D>0$ more readily. As concrete examples, we show that the cases of $D=0$ and $D=1$ indeed converge to the exact results for several Hermitian and non-Hermitian theories of the $gφ^n$ type, including the complex solutions.",

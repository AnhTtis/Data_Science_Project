\begin{abstract}

Distant protoclusters of galaxies, as the progenitors of  massive galaxy clusters in the present day, are expected to host  brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) at their early formation stage\cite{Overzier2016}. It remains unclear whether the assembly of (some) BCGs is essential to the formation of a mature cluster core or vice versa.
Here we report the detection of a pair of massive quiescent galaxies likely in the process of merging at the centre of the spectroscopically confirmed, extremely massive protocluster BOSS1244 at  a look-back time of 10.58 billion years\cite{Zheng2021, Shi2021, Cai2016}.  These galaxies, BOSS1244-QG1 ($5.25\times 10^{11}$\,M$_{\odot}$) and BOSS1244-QG2 ($1.32\times 10^{11}$\,M$_{\odot}$), were detected with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) grism slitless spectroscopic observations. These two quiescent galaxies are among the brightest member galaxies in BOSS1244 and reside at redshifts $z=2.244$ and $z=2.242$, with a half-light radius of $6.76\pm0.50$ and $2.72\pm0.16$\,kiloparsec, respectively. BOSS1244-QG1 and BOSS1244-QG2 are separated by a projected distance of about 70 physical kiloparsecs, implying that we are likely to be witnessing them during the formation of a massive BCG, through a dry merger with size and mass similiar to the most massive BCGs in the local Universe. We thus infer that BCG formation have taken place before the virialization of the cluster core, which shatter and broaden our previous understanding the BCGs in the mature galaxy clusters. Moreover, we find for the first time in BOSS1244 a strong density-star formation relation over a scale of 20 co-moving Mpc, implying that the quenching of star formation in BCGs and their progenitors is likely governed by environment-related processes before the virialization. 

\end{abstract}

BCGs are the ultra-luminous and massive elliptical galaxies usually located at the centres of galaxy clusters in the Universe\cite{Jones1984, Postman1995, Lin2004, VonDerLinden2007, Lauer2014, Zhao2017}. They are usually located close to the peaks of the cluster X-ray emission. BCGs are often used to test formation theories of ultra-massive galaxies, galaxy clusters and large-scale structures. Theoretical works suggest that the formation of BCGs is driven by cooling flows in cluster cores and galactic cannibalism through dynamical friction\cite{Ostriker1975, White1976, Richstone1976, Fabian1994}. Cosmological simulations predict that BCGs are hierarchically formed through multiple mergers of galaxies\cite{DeLucia2007} and the early assembly of BCGs occurs at higher redshifts ($z>3$)\cite{Rennehan2020}, while observational studies show that some BCGs were already in place at $z=1.2-1.5$ and experienced an early rapid growth rather than the hierarchical assembly\cite{Collins2009}. BCGs so far are generally selected from virialized galaxy clusters at $z<2$. Theoretical simulations suggest that BCGs are formed through dissipationless mergers of massive quiescent galaxies at $z\sim2$\cite{Laporte2013}. However, this prediction has not been verified by observations. Still, the early formation of the BCGs and their star formation quenching at high redshifts ($z>2$) are little know from the observational side. Therefore, direct observations of BCGs in massive protoclusters at high redshifts are essential to understand the connection between BCGs and their host clusters, as well as their formation and evolution.

 
We report observational evidence for a first detection of BCGs in formation in the core of the extremely overdense protocluster BOSS1244  at $z=2.24$, showing that the emergence of BCG may take place before the virialization of cluster core. BOSS1244 is identified as the most overdense galaxy protocluster at $z>2$ discovered to date\cite{Shi2021}. Its densest region is unvirialized and contains two substructrues in redshift space. One is at $z=2.230\pm0.002$ and the other is at $z=2.245\pm0.001$. The two substructrues have a velocity offset of  $1390\pm207$\,km\,s$^{-1}$, likely merging to form a larger system\cite{Shi2021}. Thanks to the high throughput and sensitivity  of Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we identified two quiescent galaxies BOSS1244-QG1 at $z=2.244\pm0.011$ and  BOSS1244-QG2 at $z=2.242\pm0.005$ using the HST Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) G141 grism spectroscopy. The detailed data reductions and analyses are presented in Methods. 



Pairs of massive quiescent galaxies in protocluster cores at $z>2$ have been identified in only a few cases so far.  BOSS1244-QG1 and  BOSS1244-QG2 are the brightest galaxies in our sample of 40 spectroscopically confirmed member galaxies over $2.223<z<2.255$ in the density peak region of BOSS1244 traced by H$\alpha$ emission-line galaxies (HAEs), as shown by red hexagons in Figure~\ref{fig:fig1}. The two brightest galaxies are located at the centre of the density peak. Figure~\ref{fig:fig2} displays the HST observations and one-dimensional (1D) spectra of BOSS1244-QG1 and BOSS1244-QG2.  Absorption lines (e.g., Balmer) are securely detected and no obvious emission lines are observed. The two galaxies are separated by 8$\farcs$84, i.e., a projection distance of 72.8 kiloparsecs (kpc), and their velocity separation is $\sim231\pm1158$\,km\,s$^{-1}$. The relative large error is mainly caused by the  low-resolution of the HST grism slitless spectra. 

 
 The typical S{\'e}rsic index ($n$), effective radius ($r_{\rm e}$) and stellar mass (M$_{*}$) of pure BCGs at $z\sim0$ is $4.45_{-0.11}^{+0.15}$, $11.48_{-0.53}^{+0.79}$\,kpc and $1.95_{-0.09}^{+0.04} \times 10^{11}$\,M$_{\odot}$, while these parameters for their progenitors at $z\sim2$ are predicted  to be $2.32_{-0.34}^{+0.44}$, $3.63_{-0.59}^{+0.25}$\,kpc and $8.13_{-1.12}^{+0.94} \times 10^{10}$\,M$_{\odot}$, respectively\cite{Zhao2017}.  Table~\ref{tab:taba} summarizes the physical properties of BOSS1244-QG1 and BOSS1244-QG2 in the protocluster core. Their comparison with BCGs or quiescent galaxies at $z\leq2$ is presented in Extended Data Figure~\ref{fig:fige4}. We note that the two quiescent galaxies have key characteristics close to those of local BCGs, and are much higher than the parameters expected for progenitors of BCGs at $z\sim2$, especially for BOSS1244-QG1.  BOSS1244-QG1 and BOSS1244-QG2 already have a high S{\'e}rsic index ($n>4$) and their stellar masses are mostly assembled. Their stellar ages are inferred as $2.24_{-0.20}^{+0.16}$ and $0.83_{-0.16}^{+0.12}$ billion years, corresponding to a formation redshift of $7.92_{-1.47}^{+2.83}$ and $3.08_{-0.19}^{+0.18}$, respectively. These indicate that BOSS1244-QG2 was quenched recently whereas BOSS1244-QG1 had been quenched at an earlier time. One can conclude that (some) BCGs (e.g., BOSS1244-QG1) have been formed before the virialization of a cluster core. 


 BOSS1244-QG1 and BOSS1244-QG2 are likely in the process of merging. According to the relation between galaxy pairs and merger rates derived from the $N$-body simulations\cite{Husko2022}, the estimated average merging timescale for these two quiescent galaxies is about $1.06\pm0.90$\,gigayear (Gyr), corresponding to a merger completion epoch at redshifts of $z\sim1.61\pm0.42$, in agreement with the results estimated by other models\cite{Kitzbichler2008,Lotz2008,Williams2011}. For comparison, at $z<2$ less than $10\%$ of massive quiescent galaxies are found to merge with quiescent companion of comparable mass, giving a dry major merger rate of only about $0.5\%–1\%$ per Gyr\cite{Williams2011}.
Extended Data Figure~\ref{fig:fige6} presents the evolution of overdense regions in BOSS1244. The dense structure with galaxy overdensity ($\delta_{\rm g}$) of $22.9-40.4$ in BOSS1244 is virialized at redshift $z=0.92-1.10$, less than the redshift of the merger of BOSS1244-QG1 and BOSS1244-QG2. The details of the calculations are presented in Methods. Our results provide direct observational evidence that (some) BCGs occur in unvirialized core region of a protocluster.  It indicates that some BCGs through dry merger take place before the virialization of a cluster core, against the usual expectation for the formation of BCGs in the cluster environments. 


Although BOSS1244-QG1 and BOSS1244-QG2 follow the stellar mass-size relation of field quiescent galaxies at $z=2 - 3$ within the relatively large scatter\cite{vanderWel2014,Mowla2019}, shown in Extended Data Figure~\ref{fig:fige3}, they could continue to grow and form a more massive BCG  through dry major merger. Meanwhile, theoretical simulations  demonstrate that the  large scatter at the high-mass end of the stellar mass–size relation is driven by dry mergers\cite{Nipoti2003}. Given that dry major merging  is essential to form a mature BCG\cite{Bernardi2007, Liu2009, Liu2015, vanDokkum2015}, our observations demonstrate that BOSS1244-QG1 and BOSS1244-QG2, as the progenitors of a mature BCG, have already quenched their star formation before the virialization of the BOSS1244 cluster core. This reveals that the star formation quenching of BCGs and even their progenitors may not be driven by the virialization process of a cluster core at high redshifts. The possible quenching mechanisms are discussed in Methods. In addition, BCGs usually host active galactic nuclei (AGNs) more frequently than coeval field early-type galaxies\cite{Best2007}. AGN feedback heats up the intracluster medium (ICM) around the protocluster core so that hot gas could emit in X-ray wavelengths\cite{Best2007, VonDerLinden2007}. Such processes could be investigated with X-ray observations in the future. 


We find that there is a clear gradient in galaxy star formation intensity from the centre to the outskirts of BOSS1244.  The right panel of Figure~\ref{fig:fig3} shows the relationship between equivalent width (EW) of  H$\alpha$ emission line and radial distance relative to BOSS1244-QG2 for BOSS1244 member galaxies within a scale of 21.5\,co-moving Mpc. The H$\alpha$ line equivalent width (EW) is a good indicator of galaxy star formation rate (SFR) relative to its stellar mass, i.e., specific SFR. One can see that specific SFR decreases at decreasing radial distance, indicating that the concentration of the cluster core is likely responsible for the suppression of star formation in galaxies. This supports that dense environments still suppress galaxy formation at $z>2$. From the spatial distribution of BOSS1244 member galaxies, we notice that the two quiescent galaxies BOSS1244-QG1 and BOSS1244-QG2 reside at the centre of the densest region, normal star-forming galaxies (blue points in Figure~\ref{fig:fig1}) spread in the intermedium densest region, and submilimetre galaxies (SMGs, brown squares in Figure~\ref{fig:fig1}), which are extreme dusty starbursts, are mostly in the outskirts of BOSS1244\cite{Zhang2022}. The lack of SMGs inside the core region of BOSS1244 hints a transition to the environment disfavouring the extreme starbursts\cite{Zhang2022}. The presence of quiescent galaxies BOSS1244-QG1 and BOSS1244-QG2 at the centre and an increase of specific SFR at increasing radial distance suggest an evolutionary picture for the protocluster BOSS1244:  the entire region of  BOSS1244 at early time ($z>3$) grows rapidly; the protocluster core region starts to quench star formation in galaxies, and extends gradually towards the outskirts; still strong star formation activities take place at the outer periphery of the protocluster. 



Taken together, our results unveil that formation of massive BCGs through dry major mergers may happen earlier than the full assembly of a cluster core, and the star formation quenching in BCGs and their progenitors can be completed before the cluster core virialization at $z=2-3$. It is clear that the quenching in BCGs is not regulated by the processes related to virialization or hot intracluster gas.  Massive dry pairs ($>10^{11}$\,M$_{\odot}$) are thought to be a good tracer of protocluster cores ($\sim36\arcsec=300\,$kpc in radius\cite{Ando2020} at $z=2.24$), especially for the most overdense systems in the early Universe.  
BOSS1244-QG1 and BOSS1244-QG2 provide direct evidence for the emergence of ultra-massive quiescent galaxies through dry merger in  the core region of massive protoclusters. In the future progress, James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) with unprecedented sensitivity and resolution in imaging and spectroscopy promises a  breakthrough in understanding of the formation of BCGs in protoclusters at high redshifts.

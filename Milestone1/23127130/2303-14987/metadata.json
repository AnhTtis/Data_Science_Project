    "abstract": "We prove that various Finsler metrizability problems for sprays can be reformulated in terms of the geodesic invariance of two tensors (metric and angular). We show that gyroscopic sprays is the the largest class of sprays with geodesic invariant angular metric. Scalar functions associated to these geodesically invariant tensors will be invariant as well and therefore will provide first integrals for the given spray.",

Let $\mathcal{G}_k$ be the class of graphs with minimum degree at least $k$. We prove that a no-instance of \SCT{$\mathcal{G}_k$} cannot be very large.
\begin{lemma}
    \label{lem:min}
    Let $G$ be a graph with more than $2k^2-2$ vertices.
    Then $G$ is a yes-instance of \SCT{$\mathcal{G}_k$}.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Let $M$ be the set of vertices in $G$ with degree less than $k$. Clearly, $M\subseteq S$ for every solution $S$ (i.e., $G\oplus S\in \mathcal{G}_k$).
    Let $|M|=m$. 
 Let $M'$ be the set of vertices in $V(G)\setminus M$
    adjacent to at least one vertex in $M$. As each vertex in $M$ has degree at most $k-1$, we obtain that $|M'|\leq m(k-1)$.  
    
    Let $M''=V(G)\setminus (M\cup M')$. Let $X$ be the set of vertices in $M''$ having degree at least 
    $2k-m-1$ in $G$. If $|X|\geq k$, then $G\oplus (M\cup X')\in \mathcal{G}_k$, where $X'$ is any subset of $k$ vertices of $X$ - note that degree of every vertex in $X'$ is at least $(2k-m-1)+m-(k-1)=k$, in $G\oplus (M\cup X')$.
    Therefore, assume that
    $|X|\leq k-1$. Every vertex in $M''\setminus X$
    has degree at most $2k-m-2$ in $G$. Then, every
    maximal independent set in $M''\setminus X$ has 
    size at least $|M''\setminus X|/(2k-m-1)$. Therefore,
    if $|M''\setminus X|\geq k(2k-m-1)$, then for any maximal independent set $I$ of $M''\setminus X$, $G\oplus (M\cup I)\in \mathcal{G}_k$. Hence assume that $|M''\setminus X|\leq k(2k-m-1)-1$. Therefore, if $G$ is a no-instance of \SCT{$\mathcal{G}_k$}, then the number of vertices in $G$ is  
    at most $|M|+|M'|+|X|+|M''\setminus X|\leq m+m(k-1)+(k-1)+k(2k-m-1)-1=2k^2-2$. 
\end{proof}

Lemma~\ref{lem:min} gives a polynomial-time algorithm for the problem: If $G$ has more than $2k^2-2$ vertices, then return \YES, and do an exhaustive search for a solution otherwise. 
Lemma~\ref{lem:min} also gives a simple quadratic kernel for the problem parameterized by $k$: For an input $(G,k)$
if $G$ has more than $2k^2-2$ vertices, then return
a trivial yes-instance, and return the same instance otherwise. By a result from~\cite{DBLP:journals/algorithmica/AntonyGPSSS22}, \SCT{$\mathcal{G}$} and \SCT{$\overline{\mathcal{G}}$}
are polynomially equivalent. Therefore, we obtain 
a polynomial-time algorithm for \SCG\ when $\mathcal{G}$ is the class of graphs with maximum degree at most $n-k$, for a constant $k$. It also 
implies a quadratic kernel for the problem parameterized by $k$. It remains open whether the following problem is NP-complete: Given a graph $G$ and an integer $k$, find whether $G$ can be subgraph complemented to a graph with minimum degree at least $k$. We note that, the problem is NP-complete if the objective is to make the input graph $k$-regular~\cite{DBLP:journals/algorithmica/FominGST20}.

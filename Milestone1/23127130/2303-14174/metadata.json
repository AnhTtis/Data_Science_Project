    "abstract": "As technological innovation continues to shape our world at an accelerating pace, policy makers struggle to keep up with the unintended consequences of these new technologies. To address this policy-novelty gap, Responsible Research Innovation (RRI) has been proposed as a way to drive science and technology innovation towards socially desirable goals. This work suggests a more active HCI's position in the materialisation of pluralistic future visions and emphasizes the engagement between policy design and HCI for more agile and responsive evaluation environments. It calls for both fields to engage in questioning which and how futures are constructed, who they are benefiting, and how the findings of these interventions are interpreted towards other futures.",

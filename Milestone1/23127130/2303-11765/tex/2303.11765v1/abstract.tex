Manipulating cables is challenging for robots because of the infinite degrees of freedom of the cables and frequent occlusion by the gripper and the environment. These challenges are further complicated by the dexterous nature of the operations required for cable routing and assembly, such as weaving and inserting, hampering common solutions with vision-only sensing.
% Thin, malleable objects such as cables are particularly susceptible to severe gripper/object occlusions.
% These occlusions create significant challenges in continuously sensing the cable state because the large number of degrees of freedom in a cable prevent accurate state estimation from vision alone.
In this paper, we propose to integrate tactile-guided low-level motion control with high-level vision-based task parsing for a challenging task: cable routing and assembly on a reconfigurable task board. Specifically, we build a library of tactile-guided motion primitives using a fingertip GelSight sensor, where each primitive reliably accomplishes an operation such as cable following and weaving. The overall task is inferred via visual perception given a goal configuration image, and then used to generate the primitive sequence. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of individual tactile-guided primitives and the integrated end-to-end solution, significantly outperforming the method without tactile sensing. Our reconfigurable task setup and proposed baselines provide a benchmark for future research in cable manipulation.

% Our end-to-end pipeline combines vision-guided planning and tactile-based control to attempt a challenging cable manipulation and assembly task involving a long-sequence motion through multiple fixtures. Tactile feedback is vital for perceiving the state of cable handling and therefore refine the manipulation strategy, and we demonstrate that our multimodal pipeline significantly outperforms a non-tactile baseline \textbf{Todo: put some numbers}.

% motivation: cable manipulation is challenging problem because cables are free-form and deformable in contrast to rigid objects

This paper studies a long-horizon task that involves cable routing and tethered object assembly. Particularly, we propose a novel integrated pipeline where a task is parsed via visual perception and trajectories are planned and executed in a closed-loop manner with tactile-guided motion primitives. We compare the designed method and other baselines on a reconfigurable task board, which may serve as a benchmark for future research. Experiment results indicate the necessity of tactile sensing in such tasks involving dexterous operations with cables in a realistic environment.

One key limitation of our work is that the primitives are hand-designed rather than learned from data, thus limiting their generalizability. It is interesting to create more diverse and powerful primitives leveraging imitation learning and reinforcement learning. Another limitation is the visual and tactile perception being used at different stages. In future work, we plan to fuse the sensor modalities, joining global and local information, and learning task-relevant state representations.

% - we propose end-to-end pipeline for cable manipulation task

% - our experiments show that we perform better than a baseline (no tactile) at completing the task and at generalizing to different board configurations

% - future work: fix connector issues, generalize even further? imitationlearning/behaviorial cloning on human behavior?

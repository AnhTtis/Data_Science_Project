    "abstract": "In this paper we study the dispersive properties related to a model of peridynamic evolution, governed by a non local initial value problem, in the cases of two and three spatial dimensions. The features of the wave propagation characterized by the nontrivial interactions between nonlocality and the regimes of low and high frequencies are studied and suitable numerical investigations are exposed.",

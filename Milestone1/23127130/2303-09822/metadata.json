    "abstract": "While quantum computing algorithms have been successfully applied to electronic structure of molecules, applications of quantum computing to molecular dynamics remain scarce. The variability of intra-molecular interaction potentials gives rise to vibrational states with a wide range of properties. It is therefore challenging to obtain a general representation of molecular ro-vibrational states by states of a quantum computer with a limited number of qubits and quantum gates. We demonstrate a general approach to computing the ro-vibrational energy levels of molecules by combining the discrete variable representation of molecular Hamiltonians with variational quantum eigensolvers and a greedy search of gate permutations, yielding accurate representations of both ground and excited vibrational states by compact quantum circuits with a small number of gates. To illustrate the generality and adaptability of this approach, we compute the vibrational energy levels of Cr$_2$ in seven electronic states as well as the vibrational energy levels of van der Waals complexes Ar-HCl and Mg-NH, illustrating that accuracy of 1 cm$^{-1}$ can be achieved with between 2 and 9 entangling gates.",

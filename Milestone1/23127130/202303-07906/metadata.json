    "abstract": "Label propagation is an essential semi-supervised learning method based on\ngraphs, which has a broad spectrum of applications in pattern recognition and\ndata mining. This paper proposes a quantum semi-supervised classifier based on\nlabel propagation. Considering the difficulty of graph construction, we develop\na variational quantum label propagation (VQLP) method. In this method, a\nlocally parameterized quantum circuit is created to reduce the parameters\nrequired in the optimization. Furthermore, we design a quantum semi-supervised\nbinary classifier based on hybrid Bell and $Z$ bases measurement, which has\nshallower circuit depth and is more suitable for implementation on near-term\nquantum devices. We demonstrate the performance of the quantum semi-supervised\nclassifier on the Iris data set, and the simulation results show that the\nquantum semi-supervised classifier has higher classification accuracy than the\nswap test classifier. This work opens a new path to quantum machine learning\nbased on graphs.",

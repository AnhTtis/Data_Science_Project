    "abstract": "Grammatical error correction (GEC) is a challenging task of natural language processing techniques. While more attempts are being made in this approach for universal languages like English or Chinese, relatively little work has been done for low-resource languages for the lack of large annotated corpora. In low-resource languages, the current unsupervised GEC based on language model scoring performs well. However, the pre-trained language model is still to be explored in this context. This study proposes a BERT-based unsupervised GEC framework, where GEC is viewed as multi-class classification task. The framework contains three modules: data flow construction module, sentence perplexity scoring module, and error detecting and correcting module. We propose a novel scoring method for pseudo-perplexity to evaluate a sentence's probable correctness and construct a Tagalog corpus for Tagalog GEC research. It obtains competitive performance on the Tagalog corpus we construct and open-source Indonesian corpus and it demonstrates that our framework is complementary to baseline method for low-resource GEC task.",

  abstract = 	 {We study the question of learning an adversarially robust predictor. We show that any hypothesis class $\mathcal{H}$ with finite VC dimension is robustly PAC learnable with an \emph{improper} learning rule. The requirement of being improper is necessary as we exhibit examples of hypothesis classes $\mathcal{H}$ with finite VC dimension that are \emph{not} robustly PAC learnable with any \emph{proper} learning rule.}

  abstract = 	 {The study of adversarial robustness has so far largely focused on perturbations bound in $\ell_p$-norms. However, state-of-the-art models turn out to be also vulnerable to other, more natural classes of perturbations such as translations and rotations. In this work, we thoroughly investigate the vulnerability of neural networkâbased classifiers to rotations and translations. While data augmentation offers relatively small robustness, we use ideas from robust optimization and test-time input aggregation to significantly improve robustness. Finally we find that, in contrast to the $\ell_p$-norm case, first-order methods cannot reliably find worst-case perturbations. This highlights spatial robustness as a fundamentally different setting requiring additional study.}

\begin{abstract}
Consider patch attacks, where at test-time an adversary manipulates a test image with a patch in order to induce a targeted misclassification. We consider a recent 
defense to patch attacks, Patch-Cleanser \citep{xiang2022patchcleanser}.
The Patch-Cleanser algorithm requires a prediction model to have a ``two-mask correctness'' property, meaning that  
the prediction model should correctly classify any image when any two blank %patches
masks replace portions of the image. 
\citet{xiang2022patchcleanser} learn a prediction model to be robust to two-mask operations by augmenting the training set with pairs of masks at random locations of training images, and performing \emph{empirical risk minimization} ($\ERM$) on the augmented dataset. 

However, in the non-realizable setting when no predictor is perfectly correct on {\em all} two-mask operations on all images, we exhibit an example where $\ERM$ fails.
To overcome this challenge, we propose a different algorithm that provably learns a predictor robust to {\em all} two-mask operations using an $\ERM$ oracle, based on prior work by~\citet{DBLP:conf/colt/FeigeMS15}. We also extend this result to a multiple-group setting, where we can learn a predictor that achieves low robust loss on all groups simultaneously.

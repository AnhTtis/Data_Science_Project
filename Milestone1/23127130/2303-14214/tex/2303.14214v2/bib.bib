A 2006 theorem of Charles Fefferman [6] answers this question in its full generality. In this paper, we establish a version of this theorem adapted for variants of the Whitney extension problem, including nonnegative extensions and the smooth selection problems. Among other things, we generalize the Finiteness Principle for smooth selection by Fefferman-Israel-Luli [9] to the setting of infinite sets. Our main result is stated in terms of the iterated Glaeser refinement of a bundle formed by taking potential Taylor polynomials at each point of E. In particular, we show that such bundles (and any bundles with closed, convex fibers) stabilize after a bounded number of Glaeser refinements, thus strengthening the previous results of Glaeser, Bierstone-Milman-Pawłucki, and Fefferman which only hold for bundles with affine fibers.}

abstract = {We address the question of whether geometric conditions on the given data can be preserved by a solution in (1) the Whitney extension problem, and (2) the Brenner-Fefferman-Hochster-Kollár problem, both for Cm functions. Our results involve a certain loss of differentiability. Problem (2) concerns the solution of a system of linear equations A(x)G(x)=F(x), where A is a matrix of functions on Rn, and F,G are vector-valued functions. Suppose the entries of A(x) are semialgebraic (or, more generally, definable in a suitable o-minimal structure). Then we find r=r(m) such that, if F(x) is definable and the system admits a Cr solution G(x), then there is a Cm definable solution. Likewise in problem (1), given a closed definable subset X of Rn, we find r=r(m) such that if g:X→R is definable and extends to a Cr function on Rn, then there is a Cm definable extension.}

As a consequence of this result, if Ï is linear, we show that a variant of this formula provides explicit C1,1 extensions of general (not necessarily convex) 1-jets satisfying the usual Whitney extension condition, with best possible Lipschitz constants of the gradients of the extensions. Finally, if X is a superreflexive Banach space, we establish similar results for the classes Cconv1,Î±(X).}

abstract = {Whitney's extension problem asks the following: Given a compact set EâRn and a function f:EâR, how can we tell whether there exists FâCm(Rn) such that F=f on E? A 2006 theorem of Charles Fefferman [6] answers this question in its full generality. In this paper, we establish a version of this theorem adapted for variants of the Whitney extension problem, including nonnegative extensions and the smooth selection problems. Among other things, we generalize the Finiteness Principle for smooth selection by Fefferman-Israel-Luli [9] to the setting of infinite sets. Our main result is stated in terms of the iterated Glaeser refinement of a bundle formed by taking potential Taylor polynomials at each point of E. In particular, we show that such bundles (and any bundles with closed, convex fibers) stabilize after a bounded number of Glaeser refinements, thus strengthening the previous results of Glaeser, Bierstone-Milman-PawÅucki, and Fefferman which only hold for bundles with affine fibers.}

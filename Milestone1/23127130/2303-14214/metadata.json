    "abstract": "Recent work of C. Fefferman and the first author has demonstrated that the linear system of equations\n  \\begin{equation*}\n  \\sum_{j=1}^M A_{ij}(x)F_j(x)=f_i(x)\\hspace{.2in} (i=1,...,N), \\end{equation*} has a $C^m$ solution $F=(F_1,...,F_M)$ if and only if $f_1,...,f_N$ satisfy a certain finite collection of partial differential equations. Here, the $A_{ij}$ are fixed semialgebraic functions.\n  In this paper, we consider the analogous problem for systems of linear inequalities: \\begin{equation*}\n  \\sum_{j=1}^M A_{ij}(x)F_j(x)\\le f_i(x)\\hspace{.2in} (i=1,...,N). \\end{equation*} Our main result is a negative one, demonstrated by counterexample: the existence of a $C^m$ solution $F$ may not, in general, be determined via an analogous finite set of partial differential inequalities in $f_1,...,f_N$.",

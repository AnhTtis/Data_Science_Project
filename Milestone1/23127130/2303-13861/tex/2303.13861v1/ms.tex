\begin{abstract}
The first interstellar object observed in our solar system, 1I/`Oumuamua, exhibited several peculiar properties, including extreme elongation and non-gravitational acceleration. \cite{Bergner.2023} proposed that evaporation of trapped H$_2$ created by cosmic rays (CRs) can explain the non-gravitational acceleration. However, their calculation of surface temperature ignored the crucial cooling effect of evaporating H$_2$. By taking into account the cooling by H$_2$ evaporation, we show that the surface temperature of H$_2$-water ice is lower than the temperature obtained by \cite{Bergner.2023} by a factor of 9. As a result, the thermal speed of outgassing H$_2$ is decreased by a factor of 3, which requires that all H$_2$ from water ice is dissociated by CRs in the interstellar medium, making the model untenable as an explanation for the properties of 1I/`Oumuamua. Moreover, the lower surface temperature also influences the thermal annealing of water ice, a key process that is appealed to by \cite{Bergner.2023} as a mechanism to release H$_2$.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
The detection of the first interstellar object, 1I/`Oumuamua by the Pan-STARRS survey \citep{2017MPEC....U..181B} implies an abundant population of similar interstellar objects (\citealt{Meech:2017hu}; \citealt{2018ApJ...855L..10D}). An elongated shape of semi-axes $\sim 230\m\times 35\m$ is estimated from light-curve modeling (\citealt{2017ApJ...850L..36J}). The extreme axial ratio of $\gtrsim 5:1$ implied by `Oumuamua's lightcurve is mysterious (\citealt{Fraser:2018dg}; \citealt{2015MNRAS.454..593B}). 

Several authors \citep{2017ApJ...851L..38B,Gaidos:2017wj} suggested that `Oumuamua is a contact binary, while others speculated that the bizarre shape might be the result of violent processes, such as collisions during planet formation. \cite{Domokos:2017tn} suggested that the elongated shape might arise from ablation induced by interstellar dust, and \cite{Hoang:2018es} suggested that it could originate from rotational disruption of the original body by mechanical torques. \cite{2019Icar..328...14S} suggested that the extreme elongation might arise from planetesimal collisions. The latest proposal involved tidal disruption of a larger parent object close to a dwarf star \citep{Zhang:2020eu}, but this mechanism is challenged by the preference for a disk-like shape implied by `Oumuamua's lightcurve (\citealt{2019MNRAS.489.3003M}).

The detection of non-gravitational acceleration in the trajectory of `Oumuamua is another pecularity \citep{Micheli:2018dl}. The authors suggested that cometary activity such as outgassing of volatiles could explain the acceleration excess. Interestingly, no cometary activity of carbon-based molecules was found by deep observations with the Spitzer space telescope \citep{2018AJ....156..261T} and Gemini North telescope \citep{Drahus:2018bd}. \cite{2018ApJ...868L...1B} explained the acceleration anomaly by means of radiation pressure acting on a thin lightsail, and other authors \citep{MoroMartin:2019jf,2020arXiv200810083L,2019arXiv190500935S} suggested a porous object. \cite{Fitzsimmons:2017io} proposed that an icy object of unusual composition might survive its interstellar journey. Previously, \cite{2018A&A...613A..64F} suggested that `Oumuamua might be composed of H$_2$. However, \cite{Rafikov:2018jy} argued that the level of outgassing needed to produce the acceleration excess would rapidly change the rotation period of `Oumuamua, in conflict with the observational data.

Hydrogen ice was suggested by \cite{Seligman:2020vb} to explain `Oumuamua's excess acceleration and unusual shape. Their modeling implied that the object is $\sim$ 100 Myr old. Assuming a speed of $30\km\s^{-1}$, they suggested that the object was produced in a Giant Molecular Cloud (GMC) at a distance of $\sim 5$ kpc. However, their study did not consider the destruction of H$_2$ ice in the interstellar medium (ISM), through evaporation by sunlight. \cite{HoangLoeb:2020b} showed that H$_2$ iceberg could not survive the journey as it would be heated and destroyed by starlight from the GMC birthsite to the solar system. Recent studies by \cite{Jackson.2021,Desch.2021} have proposed that 'Oumuamua is a fragment of N$_2$ ice since
an object of this type is more likely to survive the interstellar journey owing to a much lower sublimation rate. 

\cite{Bergner.2023} proposed that the cosmic-ray (CR) bombardment can dissociate water in the water ice comet and create H$_2$ which are trapped within the CR track under the surface. When 'Oumuamua approaches the Sun, solar radiation heating can cause the thermal annealing, which results in the reorganization of the water ice matrix so that H$_2$ can evaporate from the surface. They found that the surface temperature of `Oumuamua can reach above $\sim 140$ K for its heliocentric distance below 3 au (see their figure 3), which is enough for thermal annealing and evaporation of H$_2$. The observed acceleration of 1I/`Oumuamua \citep{Micheli:2018dl} can be explained if at least a third of all the water dissociated by CR impact into molecular hydrogen within the iceberg. The surface temperature of the object is a crucial parameter for the release of H$_2$ trapped within the water ice matrix. However, the treatment in \cite{Bergner.2023} ignored the effect of H$_2$ evaporative cooling. Here, we calculate the surface temperature by taking into account the evaporative cooling.

In Section \ref{sec:surface}, we discuss the heating and cooling mechanisms of the body surface and calculate the surface temperature. Our conclusions are presented in Section \ref{sec:concl}.

\section{Surface temperature}\label{sec:surface}
\subsection{Heating and radiative cooling}
Heating by starlight and solar radiation raises the surface temperature of the H$_2$-water ice. The local interstellar radiation field is assumed to have the same spectrum as the interstellar radiation field (ISRF) in the solar neighborhood \citep{1983A&A...128..212M} with a total radiation energy density of $u_{\rm MMP}\approx 8.64\times 10^{-13} \erg\cm^{-3}$. We normalize the strength of the local radiation field by the dimensionless parameter, $U$, so that the local energy density is $u_{\rm rad}=Uu_{\rm MMP}$. For simplicity, we assume a spherical object shape in our derivations, but the results can be easily generalized to other shapes. 


Let $p$ be the albedo of the object surface. The heating rate due to absorption of isotropic interstellar radiation and solar radiation is given by,
\bea
\frac{dE_{\rm abs}}{dt}=\pi R^{2}c\left[Uu_{\rm MMP}+\frac{L_{\odot}}{4\pi cd^{2}}\right](1-p)\epsilon_{\star},\label{eq:dErad}
\ena
where $\epsilon_{\star}$ is the surface emissivity averaged over the background radiation spectrum, and $d$ is the distance from the Sun \citep{HoangLoeb:2020b}. 

In principle, the object can be heated by collisions with ambient gas \citep{HoangLoeb:2020b}, but this process is subdominant in the solar system.

The cooling rate by thermal emission is given by,
\bea
\frac{dE_{\rm emiss}}{dt}=4\pi R^{2}\epsilon_{T}\sigma T^{4},\label{eq:dEemiss}
\ena
where $\epsilon_{T}=\int d\nu \epsilon(\nu)B_{\nu}(T)/\int d\nu B_{\nu}(T)$ is the bolometric emissivity, integrated over all radiation frequencies, $\nu$.

\subsection{Thermal sublimation and evaporative cooling}

The binding energy of H$_2$ to water ice is $E_{b}/k\sim 500\K$ (\citealt{1993ApJ...409L..65S}), equivalent to $E_{b}(\H_{2})\approx 0.05 \eV$. 
H$_2$ can sublimate when the surface temperature is sufficient such that the thermal energy exceeds the binding energy. The characteristic timescale for the evaporation of an H$_2$ molecule from a surface of temperature $T_{\rm ice}$ is
\bea
\tau_{\rm sub}=\nu_{0}^{-1}\exp\left(\frac{E_{b}}{k T_{\rm ice}}\right),\label{eq:tausub}
\ena
where $\nu_{0}$ is the characteristic oscillation frequency of the H$_2$ lattice \citep{1972ApJ...174..321W}. We adopt $\nu_0 = 10^{12} \s^{-1}$ for H$_2$ ice (\citealt{1986ApJ...303...56H}; \citealt{1993ApJ...409L..65S}).

Evaporating H$_2$ molecules carry away heat from the surface and cause evaporative cooling (\citealt{1972ApJ...174..321W}; \citealt{2015ApJ...806..255H}). Let f(H$_2$) be the ratio of H$_2$ to water on the ice surface. Following \cite{HoangLoeb:2020b}, the cooling rate by evaporation of H$_2$ and water is given by,
\bea
\frac{dE_{\rm evap}}{dt}=\frac{E_{b}dN_{\rm mol}}{dt}=\frac{E_{b}N_{s}}{\tau_{\rm sub}(T_{\rm ice})},\label{eq:dEevap}
\ena
where $dN_{\rm mol}/dt$ is the evaporation rate, namely, the number of molecules evaporating per unit time, and $N_{s}=4\pi R^{2}f(H_{2})/r_{s}^{2}$
is the number of surface sites with $r_{s}=10~{\rm \AA}$ being the average size of the H$_2$ surface site (\citealt{1993ApJ...409L..65S}). Here, we neglect the cooling by water because of its much higher sublimation temperature.

\subsection{Equilibrium surface temperature}

The energy balance between surface heating and cooling is described by
\bea
\frac{dE_{\rm abs}}{dt}=\frac{dE_{\rm emiss}}{dt}+\frac{dE_{\rm evap}}{dt}.\label{eq:balance1}
\ena

Using Equations (\ref{eq:dErad}), (\ref{eq:dEemiss}) and (\ref{eq:dEevap}, one obtains
\bea
\pi R^{2}c\left[Uu_{\rm MMP}+\frac{L_{\odot}}{4\pi cd^{2}}\right](1-p)\epsilon_{\star}&=& 4\pi R^{2}\epsilon_{T}\sigma T^{4}\nonumber\\
&& +\frac{E_{b}N_{s}}{\tau_{\rm sub}(T_{\rm ice})}.\label{eq:balance}
\ena

For our numerical calculations, we adopt the typical albedo value of $p=0.1$ and the interstellar radiation strength of $U=1$. The radius of the object is assumed to be $R=1000$ m, and $\epsilon_{T}=\epsilon_{\star}=1$.

Figure \ref{fig:Tsurf} (left panel) shows the heating and cooling rates when `Oumuamua is located at 1.4 au from the Sun. Evaporative cooling is dominant over radiative cooling at the temperature above 20 K. Therefore, the effect of evaporative cooling by H$_2$ cannot be ignored as in \cite{Bergner.2023} and must be considered for calculations of the surface temperature.

We numerically solve Equation (\ref{eq:balance}) for the surface equilibrium temperatures for the different distances from the Sun. 
The right panel of Figure \ref{fig:Tsurf} compares the realistic surface temperatures when the evaporating cooling is taken into account with the results without evaporative cooling for the different ratio of H$_2$ to water (f(H$_2$). For the case without evaporative cooling, our obtained temperature is comparable to those obtained in \cite{Bergner.2023} (see their figure 3). With evaporative cooling, the surface temperature increases slightly with increasing f(H$_2$) for the considered range. As shown, the realistic temperature is significantly lower than the temperature obtained when ignoring the evaporative cooling, by a factor of 9.

Evaporative cooling by H$_2$ is dominant over radiative cooling. The intersection of heating and total cooling determines the equilibrium surface temperature. Right panel: surface temperature at different distances, calculated for the case with (solid lines) and without (dashed-dotted line) evaporative cooling. Different ratio of H$_2$ to water is assumed. Evaporative cooling by H$_2$ decreases significantly the surface temperature compared to the case without evaporative cooling (dashed-dotted line).}

\section{Discussion and conclusions}\label{sec:concl}
More than 5 years after the discovery of 1I/`Oumuamua, many peculiar properties of it are still hotly debated. \cite{Bergner.2023} proposed that evaporation of trapped H$_2$ created by cosmic rays (CRs) by sunlight can explain the non-gravitational acceleration. However, their calculations of surface temperature disregard the cooling effect by evaporating H$_2$. Here we found that the evaporative cooling is much more efficient than radiative cooling at temperatures above 20 K (see Figure \ref{fig:Tsurf}, left panel). By taking into account the evaporative cooling by H$_2$ evaporation, our results (see Figure \ref{fig:Tsurf}, right panel) show that the surface temperatures of H$_2$-water ice are lower by a factor of 9 than the temperature obtained by \cite{Bergner.2023} (see their figure 3). Therefore, the thermal speed of outgassing H$_2$ is decreased by a factor of 3. As a result, the thermal speed of outgassing H$_2$ is decreased by a factor of 3, requiring that all H$_2$ was made from water ice is produced by CRs in the interstellar medium. That is a constraint which is unlikely to be satisfied as it necessitates an oxygen iceberg. Given this constraint, the requirement for a surface layer that is made of pure molecular hydrogen will not survive the journey through interstellar space as a result of heating by starlight \citep{HoangLoeb:2020b}.

Moreover, the lower surface temperature also influences the thermal annealing of water ice, a key process that is appealed to by \cite{Bergner.2023} to release H$_2$.

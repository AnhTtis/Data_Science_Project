    "abstract": "The opacity of graphene is known to be approximately given by the fine structure constant $α$ times $π$. We point out the fact that the opacity is roughly independent of the frequency of the light can be attributed to the topological charge of the Dirac point. As a result, one can literally see the topological charge by naked eyes from the opacity of graphene, and moreover it implies that the fine structure constant is topologically protected. A similar analysis applied to 3D topological insulators suggests that their opacity in the infrared region is also given by $πα$, which may be seen by naked eyes through an infrared lens, and ideally is independent of the thickness of the material since it is contributed solely from the topological surface states. For 3D Dirac or Weyl semimetals, the optical absorption power is linear to the frequency in the infrared region, with a linearity given by the fine structure constant and the topological charge of Weyl points.",

In this paper, we address the general problem of detecting the novelty of each actor's action(s) in video for the first time. 
To this end, we develop a new open set action recognition framework using Multi-Label Evidential Learning (\sysname{}).
Based on actor-context-object relation representation, the proposed Beta Evidential Neural Network can formulate Beta distributions for single/multi-actor, single/multi-action settings.
To optimize the network, we add the multi-label evidence debiasing constraint and propose the primal-dual average scheme update learning method with theoretical analysis.
Thus both direct and indirect dependencies of action predictions are reduced for more robust results.
The experiments show that Beta distribution more accurately classifies novel action(s) than the previous Dirichlet distribution.

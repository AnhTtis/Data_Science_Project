abstract = {Mathematical models of radiation carcinogenesis are important for understanding mechanisms and for interpreting or extrapolating risk. There are two classes of such models: (1) long-term formalisms that track pre-malignant cell numbers throughout an entire lifetime but treat initial radiation dose-response simplistically and (2) short-term formalisms that provide a detailed initial dose-response even for complicated radiation protocols, but address its modulation during the subsequent cancer latency period only indirectly. We argue that integrating short- and long-term models is needed. As an example of this novel approach, we integrate a stochastic short-term initiation/inactivation/repopulation model with a deterministic two-stage long-term model. Within this new formalism, the following assumptions are implemented: radiation initiates, promotes, or kills pre-malignant cells; a pre-malignant cell generates a clone, which, if it survives, quickly reaches a size limitation; the clone subsequently grows more slowly and can eventually generate a malignant cell; the carcinogenic potential of pre-malignant cells decreases with age.},

abstract = {As the number of cancer survivors grows, prediction of radiotherapy-induced second cancer risks becomes increasingly important. Because the latency period for solid tumors is long, the risks of recently introduced radiotherapy protocols are not yet directly measurable. In the accompanying article, we presented a new biologically based mathematical model, which, in principle, can estimate second cancer risks for any protocol. The novelty of the model is that it integrates, into a single formalism, mechanistic analyses of pre-malignant cell dynamics on two different time scales: short-term during radiotherapy and recovery; long-term during the entire life span. Here, we apply the model to nine solid cancer types (stomach, lung, colon, rectal, pancreatic, bladder, breast, central nervous system, and thyroid) using data on radiotherapy-induced second malignancies, on Japanese atomic bomb survivors, and on background US cancer incidence. Potentially, the model can be incorporated into radiotherapy treatment planning algorithms, adding second cancer risk as an optimization criterion.},

These different versions of the tcp model often fitted tumor control data equally well, because of the high degree of correlation between the parameters. Nevertheless the results were very different from a physical point of view and we suggest that sometimes it is possible to choose between equally good fits on the basis of physical considerations.

The formula can be straightforwardly and relatively quickly fitted to clinical data, yielding radiobiological parameter values for use in tcp modelling. The formula was fitted to published tcp data which catalogued tumour control records grouped by dose and tumour volume, and treatment duration. Fitted parameter values, confidence intervals and goodness-of-fit statistics were determined. The sets of parameter values obtained are unique only to within a scaling factor. The formula provides non-rejectable fits to data which grouped tcp by dose and volume when radiosensitivity parameters take values close to laboratory estimates, the fitted volume dependence parameter, however, taking rather high values. Good fits are obtainable with the intuitively reasonable volume parameter value of one, but with radiosensitivity values around one-third of their laboratory estimates. Non-rejectable fits to data which grouped tcp by dose and treatment duration may be obtained with radiosensitivity and repopulation rate parameters lying close to laboratory estimates.},

@article{Brenner1993,
abstract = {Purpose: Tumor volume has a profound influence on the dose required to control a given type of tumor. The most obvious explanation for this is related to the larger number of stem cells which must be sterilized, leading to a more stringent requirement on cell survival. There are, however, other mechanisms by which volume may influence tumor control, such as clonogenic fraction, oxygenation or inter-cellular communication. We investigate the question of whether the effect of volume on tumor control is, in general, predictable on the basis solely of the differing number of stem cells. Methods and Materials: We investigate whether the effect of volume on tumor control in four sites can be predicted, using the linear-quadratic formalism, based on the assumption that the number of cells that must be sterilized is directly proportional to the tumor volume. We require that the biological parameters in the model should have plausible values. Results: We find that the results of four clinical data sets, exhibiting a wide range of doses, volumes, and tumor control rates, are consistent with the hypothesis that the number of potential stem cells which must be sterilized is proportional to the tumor volume. Conclusions: If these considerations are correct, the potential exists that realistic radiobiologically-based dose corrections for tumor size could be routinely made. This applies both to an entire treatment, and also between fractions, as the tumor shrinks. Such an approach may contribute towards optimized radiotherapy. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {Purpose: It is well established for certain human tumor histologies that increasing tumor volume leads to a decreasing probability of tumor control. The simplest explanation for these findings is that the number of tumor clonogens that must be sterilized to control a tumor increases with tumor volume. In this investigation we consider whether clinical evidence favors a further hypothesis, namely, that clonogen number increases in direct proportion to tumor volume. Methods and Materials: Previously published data on the volume-cure relationship for breast tumors, neck nodes, malignant melanoma, and squamous cell carcinomas of the oropharynx and the uterine cervix were analyzed. Results: We found in all these data sets evidence that the effect of tumor volume on tumor control probability was less than what would be expected under the assumption of proportionality between number of clonogens and volume. We describe good reasons to believe that this is the result of patient-to-patient variability in radiocurability, and possibly other factors as well. Conclusions: Clinical data do provide evidence for a highly significant reduction of tumor control probability with increasing tumor volume. However, because of heterogeneity in patient and tumor characteristics, the volume effect is less pronounced than would be expected from a simple proportionality between number of clonogens and volume. In principle this simple proportionality does hold in individual patients, so that standard approaches for treatment plan optimization in individuals may still be valid.},

The model can be used to describe situations where both the dose and the clonogenic cell densities are inhomogeneously distributed; however there is still uncertainty about its radiobiological parameters and the author aims to establish parameters for four types of tumour. In its simplest form, when the volumes are spherical, the clonogenic cell density is considered constant throughout the volume and the dose is uniform, the model has been used (by D.J. Brenner, 1993) to predict the radiobiological parameter alpha which allows the model to best fit the observed clinical data for four types of tumour. Here a new set of fits to the data presented by Brenner is constructed using a model which includes the distribution of radiosensitivity across a heterogeneous patient population. It is shown that this leads to a different set of optimum radiobiological parameters when the clonogenic cell density is of the order of 107 cells cm-3.},

The impact of tumor volume on radiotherapy outcome has long been recognized and in this paper its predictive potential is investigated. Methods: Re-evaluation of clinical data from the literature. Results: Tumor volume significantly influences radiotherapy outcome and in many sites it is likely a superior prognostic indicator to tumor stage, which reflects tumor size only partially and is mainly correlated to operability, Tumors even of identical stage may vary by factors of more than 100 in volume and neglect of this heterogeneity clearly reduces the power of a study considerably. The precision requirements for the measurement of tumor volume are small; ±50% is sufficient for reasonable results. Conclusion: The data evaluated here suggest that tumor volume is the most precise and most relevant predictor of radiotherapy outcome. Its determination is achievable with sufficient accuracy in most radiotherapy departments. Individual tumor volume should always be reported in clinical studies and considered in data analyses.},

In practice tumours will almost certainly have a non-uniform clonogenic cell density. The paper extends one particular model of tumour control probability (TCP) to incorporate a variable clonogenic cell density while at the same time assuming a constant 2 Gy fraction size and a uniform radiosensitivity throughout the treatment. Since there are virtually no in vivo data on the variation of density the authors consider some model situations. One clear conclusion is that a large reduction in clonogenic cell density at the edges of a tumour would permit only a very modest decrease in dose if the TCP is not to be reduced. In general the effect on TCP is a complicated function of the variation in both dose and clonogenic cell density. The authors give the equations which enable both to be included.},

abstract = {Purpose: A homogeneous tumor control probability (TCP) model has previously been used to estimate the $\alpha$/$\beta$ ratio for prostate cancer from clinical dose-response data. For the ratio to be meaningful, it must be assumed that parameter ratios are not sensitive to the type of tumor control model used. We investigated the validity of this assumption by deriving analytic relationships between the $\alpha$/$\beta$ estimates from a homogeneous TCP model, ignoring interpatient heterogeneity, and those of the corresponding heterogeneous (population-averaged) model that incorporated heterogeneity. Methods and Materials: The homogeneous and heterogeneous TCP models can both be written in terms of the geometric parameters D50 and $\gamma$50. We show that the functional forms of these models are similar. This similarity was used to develop an expression relating the homogeneous and heterogeneous estimates for the $\alpha$/$\beta$ ratio. The expression was verified numerically by generating pseudo-data from a TCP curve with known parameters and then using the homogeneous and heterogeneous TCP models to estimate the $\alpha$/$\beta$ ratio for the pseudo-data. Results: When the dominant form of interpatient heterogeneity is that of radiosensitivity, the homogeneous and heterogeneous $\alpha$/$\beta$ estimates differ. This indicates that the presence of this heterogeneity affects the value of the $\alpha$/$\beta$ ratio derived from analysis of TCP curves. Conclusions: The $\alpha$/$\beta$ ratio estimated from clinical dose-response data is model dependent-a heterogeneous TCP model that accounts for heterogeneity in radiosensitivity will produce a greater $\alpha$/$\beta$ estimate than that resulting from a homogeneous TCP model. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {A population tumor control probability (TCP) model for fractionated external beam radiotherapy, based on Poisson statistics and in the limit of large parameter heterogeneity, is studied. A reduction of a general eight-parameter TCP equation, which incorporates heterogeneity in parameters characterizing linear-quadratic radiosensitivity, repopulation, and clonogen number, to an equation with four parameters is obtained. The four parameters represent the mean and standard deviation for both clonogen number and a generalized radiosensitivity that includes linear-quadratic and repopulation descriptors. Further, owing to parameter inter-relationship, it is possible to express these four parameters as three ratios of parameters in the large heterogeneity limit. These ratios can be directly linked to two defining features of the TCP dose response: D50 and $\gamma$50. In the general case, the TCP model can be written in terms of D50, $\gamma$50 and a third parameter indicating the ratio of the levels of heterogeneity in clonogen number and generalized radiosensitivity; however, the third parameter is unnecessary when either of these two sources of heterogeneity is dominant. It is shown that heterogeneity in clonogen number will have little impact on the TCP formula for clinical scenarios, and thus it will generally be the case that the fundamental form of the Poisson-based population TCP model can be specified completely in terms of D50 and $\gamma$50: TCP= 1/2 erfc [$\pi$ $\gamma$50 (D50 D-1)]. This implies that limited radiobiological information can be determined by the analysis of dose response data: information about parameter ratios can be ascertained, but knowledge of absolute values for the fundamental radiobiological parameters will require independent auxiliary measurements. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.},

abstract = {The heterogeneity of human tumour radiation response is well known. Researchers have used the normal distribution to describe interpatient tumour radiosensitivity. However, many natural phenomena show a log-normal distribution. Log-normal distributions are common when mean values are low, variances are large and values cannot be negative. These conditions apply to radiosensitivity. The aim of this work was to evaluate the log-normal distribution to predict clinical tumour control probability (TCP) data and to compare the results with the homogeneous ($\delta$-function with single $\alpha$-value) and normal distributions. The clinically derived TCP data for four tumour types - melanoma, breast, squamous cell carcinoma and nodes - were used to fit the TCP models. Three forms of interpatient tumour radiosensitivity were considered: the log-normal, normal and $\delta$-function. The free parameters in the models were the radiosensitivity mean, standard deviation and clonogenic cell density. The evaluation metric was the deviance of the maximum likelihood estimation of the fit of the TCP calculated using the predicted parameters to the clinical data. We conclude that (1) the log-normal and normal distributions of interpatient tumour radiosensitivity heterogeneity more closely describe clinical TCP data than a single radiosensitivity value and (2) the log-normal distribution has some theoretical and practical advantages over the normal distribution. Further work is needed to test these models on higher quality clinical outcome datasets. {\textcopyright} 2007 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The dose of radiation that locally controls human tumors treated electively  or for gross disease is rarely well defined. These doses can be useful in understanding the dose requirements of novel therapies featuring inhomogeneous dosimetry and in an adjuvant setting. The goal of this study was to compute the dose of radiation that locally controls 50% (TCD50) of tumors in human subjects. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Logit regression was used with data collected from single institutions or from combinations of local control data accumulated from several institutions treating the same disease. RESULTS: 90 dose response curves were calculated; 62 of macroscopic tumor therapy, 28 of elective therapy with surgery for primary control. The mean and median TCD50 for gross disease were 50.0 and 51.9 Gy, respectively. The mean and median TCD50 for microscopic disease control were 39.3 and 37.9 Gy, respectively. At the TCD50, an additional dose of 1 Gy controlled an additional 2.5% (median) additional patients with macroscopic disease and 4.2% (median) additional patients with microscopic disease. For both macro- and microscopic disease, an increase of 1% of dose at the TCD50 increased control rates approximately 1% (median) or 2-3% (mean). A predominance of dose response curves had shallow slopes accounting for the discrepancy between mean and median values. CONCLUSION: Doses to control microscopic disease are approximately 12 Gy less than that required to control macroscopic disease, and are about 79% of the dose required to control macroscopic disease. The percentage increase in cures expected for a 1% increase in dose is similar for macroscopic microscopic disease, with a median value of approximately 1%/% and a mean of approximately 2.7%/%.},

Using this model, we could generate realistic TCP curves using parameter estimates consistent with those reported from in vitro studies, subject to the inclusion of a radiosensitivity (or dose)-modifying factor. We then demonstrated that the model was dominated by the heterogeneity in alpha (tumor radiosensitivity) and derived an approximate simplified model incorporating this heterogeneity. This simplified model is expressible in a compact closed form, which it is practical to fit to clinical datasets. Using two previously analysed datasets, we fit the model using direct maximum-likelihood techniques and obtained parameter estimates that were, again, consistent with the experimental data on the radiosensitivity of primary human tumor cells. This heterogeneity model includes the same number of adjustable parameters as the standard LQ model. RESULTS The modified model provides parameter estimates that can easily be reconciled with the in vitro measurements. The simplified (approximate) form of the heterogeneity model is a compact, closed-form probit function that can readily be fitted to clinical series by conventional maximum-likelihood methodology. This heterogeneity model provides a slightly better fit to the datasets than the conventional LQ model, with the same numbers of fitted parameters. The parameter estimates of the clinically important time factors and lag periods are very similar to those obtained from the conventional LQ model, but with slightly narrower confidence intervals, reflecting the better fit to the clinical data. DISCUSSION We have demonstrated, as have others, the importance of intertumor heterogeneity in the response of patient populations to radiotherapy. With the possible inclusion of a radiosensitivity-modifying factor (in vitro/in vivo) of around 1.7, the in vivo data can be made consistent with the in vitro SF2 and Tpot data. Fitting two previously analyzed multicenter datasets indicated that previous analyses based on conventional LQ models gave results for clinically important time factors and lags periods that were not significantly biased by the failure to include intertumor heterogeneity, with slightly narrower confidence intervals, reflecting the better fit to the clinical data. The simple closed-form model we have developed allows direct estimation of the heterogeneity in radiosensitivity within clinical series, and should prove useful in the analysis of other clinical series.},

@article{Radonic2021,
abstract = {Purpose: Tumor control probability (TCP) models based on Poisson statistics characterize the distribution of surviving clonogens. Thus enabling the calculation of TCP for individuals. To mathematically describe clinically observed survival data of patient cohorts it is necessary to extend the Poisson TCP model. This is typically done by either incorporating variations of model parameters or by using an empirical logistic model. The purpose of this work is the development of an analytical population TCP model by mechanistic extension of the Possion model. Methods and Materials: The frequency distribution of gross tumor volumes was used to incorporate tumor volume variations into the TCP model. Additionally the tumor cell density variation was incorporated. Both versions of the population TCP model were fitted to clinical data and compared to existing literature. Results: It was shown that clinically observed brain tumor volumes of dogs undergoing radiotherapy are distributed according to an exponential distribution. The average gross tumor volume size was 3.37 cm3. Fitting the population TCP model including the volume variation using linear-quadratic and track-event model yielded$\alpha$=0.36Gy−−1a, $\beta$=0.045Gy−−2, a=0.9yr−−1, TD=5.0d,and p=.36Gy−−1, q=0.48Gy−−1, a=0.80yr−−1, TD=3.0d, respectively. Fitting the population TCP model including both the volume and cell density variation yielded $\alpha$=0.43Gy−−1, $\beta$=0.0537Gy−−2, a=2.0yr−−1, TD=3.0d, $\sigma$=2.5,and p=.43Gy−−1, q=0.55Gy−−1, a=2.0yr−−1, TD=2.0d, $\sigma$=3.0,respectively. Conclusions: Two sets of radiobiological parameters were obtained which can be used for quantifying the TCP for radiation therapy of brain tumors in dogs. We established a mechanistic link between the poisson statistics based individual TCP model and the logistic TCP model. This link can be used to determine the radiobiological parameters of patient specific TCP models from published fits of logistic models to cohorts of patients.},

abstract = {Background
It is shown that tumour volume distributions can yield information on two aspects of cancer research: tumour induction and tumour control.
Materials and methods
From the hypothesis that the intrinsic distribution of breast cancer volumes follows an exponential distribution, firstly the probability density function of tumour growth time was deduced via a mathematical transformation of the probability density functions of tumour volumes. In a second step, the distribution of tumour volumes was used to model the variation of the clonogenic cell number between patients in order to determine tumour control probabilities for radiotherapy patients.
Results
Distribution of lag times, i.e. the time from the appearance of the first fully malignant cell until a clinically observable cancer, can be used to deduce the probability of tumour induction as a function of patient age. The integration of the volume variation with a Poisson-TCP model results in a logistic function which explains population-averaged survival data of radiotherapy patients.
Conclusions
The inclusion of tumour volume distributions into the TCP formalism enables a direct link to be deduced between a cohort TCP model (logistic) and a TCP model for individual patients (Poisson). The TCP model can be applied to non-uniform tumour dose distributions.}

    abstract = {The relationships between cellular, structural and dynamical properties of tumors have traditionally been studied separately. Here, we construct a quantitative, predictive theory of solid tumor growth, metabolic rate, vascularization and necrosis that integrates the relationships between these properties. To accomplish this, we develop a comprehensive theory that describes the interface and integration of the tumor vascular network and resource supply with the cardiovascular system of the host. Our theory enables a quantitative understanding of how cells, tissues, and vascular networks act together across multiple scales by building on recent theoretical advances in modeling both healthy vasculature and the detailed processes of angiogenesis and tumor growth. The theory explicitly relates tumor vascularization and growth to metabolic rate, and yields extensive predictions for tumor properties, including growth rates, metabolic rates, degree of necrosis, blood flow rates and vessel sizes. Besides these quantitative predictions, we explain how growth rates depend on capillary density and metabolic rate, and why similar tumors grow slower and occur less frequently in larger animals, shedding light on Peto's paradox. Various implications for potential therapeutic strategies and further research are discussed.},

@article{Heuser1979,
abstract = {The growth rates of breast cancers are a critical aspect of the natural history  of the disease. Growth rates of 32 primary breast cancers were determined from serial mammographic views of tumor nucleus shadows in a population of 109 cancers. These cancers were found in a screening population of 10,120 women receiving over 30,000 mammograms over 3 years. Tumor volume doubling times ranged from 109 days to 944 days with mean doubling time of 325 days in 23 cases with 9 tumors showing no growth. Additional cancers surfaced that were growing too fast to be measured. These cancers were significantly more likely to metastasize but because of the small sample size the absolute percentage of tumors in that fast growing subset was not determinable but ranged between 17 and 77% of the 109 cancers.},

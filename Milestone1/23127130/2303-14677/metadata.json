    "abstract": "By using the finite element code ASTRA, the effect of vibrations on the melt flow in Bridgman crystal growth is investigated for the Earth and Space gravity conditions. It is found that the vibrations significantly decrease the width of interfacial boundary layers in Bridgman crystal growth with submerged vibrator. The influence of the geometrical arrangement of the vibrator, the thermo-gravitational conditions, the frequency of vibration and the rotation effects is investigated. The averaged vibrational flow (AVF) parameters were calculated by means of post-processing the instant thermomechanical fields found in numerical integration of Navier-Stokes problem. The structure of AVF depends on the physical properties of the melt and on the frequency/amplitude values. The frequency of vibrations (vibrational Reynolds number) influences essentially on the AVF structure. Numerical results show that the direction of AVF depends with frequency. It is shown that for normal and low gravity conditions the vibrations can decrease the width of boundary layers and increase the boundary temperature gradients. This can intensify heat and mass transfer near the solid-liquid interface and increase the rate of crystal growth.",

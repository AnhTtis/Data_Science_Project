    \caption{A visual comparison between various sample selection strategies, including: \emph{(left)} the small-loss approaches~\cite{li2020dividemix} typically have two networks, where one model uses the loss values of samples to select clean and noisy instances to train the other and vice versa; \emph{(middle)} feature-based approaches~\cite{kim2021fine} detect outliers of features belonging to one class to detect noisy-label samples; \emph{(right)} PASS consists of three networks where samples agreed by two networks are considered as clean and used for training the third network.}

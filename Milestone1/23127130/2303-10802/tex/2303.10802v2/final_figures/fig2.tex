    \caption{Our proposed method, PASS, consists of three classifiers trained in a round-robin fashion, with two classifiers (\(h_{\gamma_{2},\gamma_{3}}\) in green) being used to select samples for training the other classifier (\(h_{\gamma_{1}}\) in red).
    The training process begins with a warm-up of all classifiers, followed by the sample selection stage. During the selection stage, the peer classifiers calculate the prediction agreement using cosine similarity between their posterior distributions, followed by Otsu's thresholding~\cite{otsu1979threshold} to automatically find the threshold $t$ to select the clean set ${D}_{\text{clean}}$ and noisy set ${D}_{\text{noisy}}$. In the training stage, we follow the robust noisy-label training algorithm.}

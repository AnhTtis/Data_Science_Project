    \caption{Critical Difference (CD) diagram comparing DivideMix~\cite{li2020dividemix}, InstanceGM~\cite{Garg_2023_WACV}, and DivideMix-PASS (ours). Average ranks are derived from performance across datasets, with lines indicating the range of non-significant differences per the Nemenyi test. This test estimated the CD value of \(1.15\), which is used to estimate if two models are different with the significance level of \(0.1\). DivideMix-PASS demonstrates statistically significant superiority, InstanceGM~\cite{Garg_2023_WACV} and DivideMix~\cite{li2020dividemix} are not significantly different.}

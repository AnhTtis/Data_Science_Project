    "abstract": "Emotional Reaction Intensity(ERI) estimation is an important task in multimodal scenarios, and has fundamental applications in medicine, safe driving and other fields. In this paper, we propose a solution to the ERI challenge of the fifth Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild(ABAW), a dual-branch based multi-output regression model. The spatial attention is used to better extract visual features, and the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients technology extracts acoustic features, and a method named modality dropout is added to fusion multimodal features. Our method achieves excellent results on the official validation set.",

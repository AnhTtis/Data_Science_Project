INTRODUCTION

Outline based on Beesley and Mukherjee (2020), Biometrics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Application setting
    \item General bias issues due to misclassification
    \item Why does misclassification happen? How common is it?
    \item Note that misclassification is covariate-dependent
    \item \textbf{Gap in the literature:} In general, however, previous work on covariate-dependent misclassification requires strong assumptions like perfect sensitivity or specificity \autocite{beesley2020statistical}, an available gold standard measure \autocite{stamey2004parameter}, or repeated measures data \autocite{albert1997modeling}, necessitating new statistical methods for more complex settings. 
    \item Explain method
    \item Bring up the problem of label switching and give some background.
\end{itemize}

    \item Feasibility of methods is limited by model identifiability problems
    \item Characterize model identifiability as label switching
    \item Describe previous methods of fixing label switching
    \item Overview of methods and findings
    \item Paper outline

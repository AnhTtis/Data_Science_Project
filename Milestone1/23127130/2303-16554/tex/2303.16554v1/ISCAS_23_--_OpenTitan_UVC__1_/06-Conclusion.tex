\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

We present an open-source SoC design for ultra-low power mission computers compatible with the limited power envelope of nano-UAVs.
Our design provides sufficient computational resources to enable autonomous navigation tasks while enabling advanced hardware security such as RoT.
The SoC is built around a 64-bit RISC-V CVA6 core featuring full support for Linux accelerated by an 8-core cluster of 32-bit RISC-V cores acting as a software-programmable accelerator for mission control tasks.. 
We integrate a security enclave based on an open-source RoT, enabling a multi-drone UVC use case.
In our scenario, OpenTitan detects a security breach on the SoC and communicates an SOS message to a receiver drone by sending it through LEDs blinking.
The receiver nano-drone can detect the message by running on the programmable accelerator a visual CNN and a simple state machine that decodes it.
With a power envelope of \SI{250}{\milli\watt} and a silicon footprint of \SI{9}{\square\milli\meter}, the proposed SoC can recognize an SOS message in \SI{1.3}{\second} performing 2.3$\times$ faster than a COTS baseline equipped with the GAP8 SoC, while offering support for a security enclave and full-fledged operating system.

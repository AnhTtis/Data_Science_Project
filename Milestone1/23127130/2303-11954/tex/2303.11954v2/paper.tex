\begin{abstract}
Bayesian Optimization (BO) is used to find the global optima of black box functions. In this work, we propose a practical BO method of function compositions where the form of the composition is known but the constituent functions are expensive to evaluate. By assuming an independent Gaussian process (GP) model for each of the constituent black-box function, we propose Expected Improvement (EI) and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) based BO algorithms and demonstrate their ability to outperform not just vanilla BO but also the current state-of-art algorithms. We demonstrate a novel application of the proposed methods to dynamic pricing in revenue management when the underlying demand function is expensive to evaluate.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:future_works}
In this work, we have proposed EI and UCB based BO algorithms, namely cEI and cUCB for optimizing functions with a composite nature. We further apply our algorithms to the revenue maximization problem and test our methods on different market scenarios. We show that our algorithms, particularly cUCB, outperforms vanilla BO as well as the current state of the art BO-CF algorithm. Our algorithms are  computationally superior because they do not require multiple Cholesky decompositions as required in the BO-CF algorithm.

As part of future work, we would like to provide  theoretical bounds on cumulative regret for the proposed algorithms. We would also like to see the applicability of the proposed algorithms in hyper-parameter tuning for optimizing F1 score. It would also be interesting to propose BO algorithms for an extended model wherein the member functions can be probed independently from each other at different costs.

% \textcolor{blue}{Conclude by saying we outperform classic acquistion functions in regret and eicf/hogp in runtime. Thus, we propose a good balance. Think of some future works maybe or change the section title.}

% \textbf{expand on the future work part .... say theoretical guarantees on regret is one future work. Second future work is to study the problem of precision and recall. The other is to study the case when one has to evaluate different functions independently and when there is a different cost for evaluating different functions, then one has to trade off different function evaluations.}


% \textcolor{red}{Loss in revenue due to regret in comparison to eicf can also be accounted for in savings of hardware requirements for our methodology maybe?}

% \textcolor{blue}{Future work: look at applications of causal graph BO to assist in supply chain optimization. this lays the groundwork for that.}

% \textcolor{red}{fix references, they are not consistent in the information they contain.... somewhere you have doi, reference 5 is going to 5 lines .... reference 1 and 2 have DOI given twoice ,,, arxiv link given twice .. this is enough ground for rejection by virtue of being shabby}

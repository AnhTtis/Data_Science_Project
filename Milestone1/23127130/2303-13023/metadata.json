    "abstract": "This study presents an importance sampling formulation based on adaptively relaxing parameters from the indicator function and/or the probability density function. The formulation embodies the prevalent mathematical concept of relaxing a complex problem into a sequence of progressively easier sub-problems. Due to the flexibility in constructing relaxation parameters, relaxation-based importance sampling provides a unified framework to formulate various existing variance reduction techniques, such as subset simulation, sequential importance sampling, and annealed importance sampling. More crucially, the framework lays the foundation for creating new importance sampling strategies, tailoring to specific applications. To demonstrate this potential, two importance sampling strategies are proposed. The first strategy couples annealed importance sampling with subset simulation, focusing on low-dimensional problems. The second strategy aims to solve high-dimensional problems by leveraging spherical sampling and scaling techniques. Both methods are desirable for fragility analysis in performance-based engineering, as they can produce the entire fragility surface in a single run of the sampling algorithm. Three numerical examples, including a 1000-dimensional stochastic dynamic problem, are studied to demonstrate the proposed methods.",

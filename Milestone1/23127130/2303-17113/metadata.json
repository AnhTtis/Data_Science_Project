    "abstract": "In this paper, we obtain the optimal rate of convergence in periodic homogenization of forced graphical mean curvature flows in the laminated setting. We prove that a rate of convergence is $O(\\varepsilon^{1/2})$ as $\\varepsilon\\to0^+$, and we show by examples that this rate of convergence $O(\\varepsilon^{1/2})$ as $\\varepsilon\\to0^+$ is optimal.",

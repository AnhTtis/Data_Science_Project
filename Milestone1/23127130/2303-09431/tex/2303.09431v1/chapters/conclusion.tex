\section{Conclusion}

In this work we propose a novel approach to extract geometrically accurate meshes from NeRF based architectures. Our SSAN model can be trained from any NeRF architecture  without a significant penalty in training time. Our neural mesh representation can be rendered  at high frame rates on commodity hardware. Thanks to their geometric accuracy, our extracted meshes can be quickly   visualized, and also be used in physically accurate settings in simulations, to compute accurate occlusions and interactions with other objects.
Our work is nevertheless limited in some aspects: rendering detailed surfaces causes us to generate meshes with a high number of faces and vertices, thus, our method would gain from using an adaptative mesh reconstruction strategy. Moreover, on large (unbounded) and detailed scenes, we are limited to lower resolutions to not hinder  the overall size of the model. Finally, the appearance network that we are using is a non-standard component that requires customization of existing renderers. Being able to learn the underlying materials, as methods like~\cite{boss2022-samurai} would further simplify the integration of meshes in other tools.

    "abstract": "For $1<p<\\infty$, we emulate the Bergman projection on Reinhardt domains by using a Banach-space basis of $L^p$-Bergman space. The construction gives an integral kernel generalizing the ($L^2$) Bergman kernel. The operator defined by the kernel is shown to be absolutely bounded projection on the $L^p$-Bergman space on a class of domains where the $L^p$-boundedness of the Bergman projection fails for certain $p \\neq 2$. As an application, we identify the duals of these $L^p$-Bergman spaces with weighted Bergman spaces.",

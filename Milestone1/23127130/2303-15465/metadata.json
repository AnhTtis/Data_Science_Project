    "abstract": "In the analysis of large/big data sets, aggregation (replacing values of a variable over a group by a single value) is a standard way of reducing the size (complexity) of the data. Data analysis programs provide different aggregation functions.\n  Recently some books dealing with the theoretical and algorithmic background of traditional aggregation functions were published. A problem with traditional aggregation is that often too much information is discarded thus reducing the precision of the obtained results. A much better, preserving more information, summarization of original data can be achieved by representing aggregated data using selected types of complex data.\n  In complex data analysis the measured values over a selected group $A$ are aggregated into a complex object $Σ(A)$ and not into a single value. Most of the aggregation functions theory does not apply directly. In our contribution, we present an attempt to start building a theoretical background of complex aggregation.\n  We introduce and discuss exactly mergeable summaries for which it holds for merging of disjoint sets of units\n  \\[ Σ(A \\cup B) = F( Σ(A),Σ(B)),\\qquad \\mbox{ for } \\quad A\\cap B = \\emptyset .\\]",

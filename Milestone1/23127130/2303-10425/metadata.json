    "abstract": "We consider a free-fermion chain with a conformal defect that features an extended zero mode, and study the entanglement properties in its mixed ground state. The zero-mode induced degeneracy modifies the density of states in the single-particle entanglement spectrum, which can be calculated via the full counting statistics. For a homogeneous chain, the resulting change in the Rényi entropy is derived analytically for arbitrary subsystem ratios in the thermodynamic limit. For a conformal defect located in the center, analogous results can be obtained for the half-chain entanglement. In particular, we observe parity effects for half-chains with even/odd sites, which do not decay with size.",

In this article, we introduce the notion of a wedge of graphs and provide detailed computations for the independence complex of a wedge of path and cycle graphs. In particular, we show that these complexes are either contractible or wedges of spheres. 
%We also describe the relationship between the chromatic number of a wedge of graphs with the chromatic number of  component graphs

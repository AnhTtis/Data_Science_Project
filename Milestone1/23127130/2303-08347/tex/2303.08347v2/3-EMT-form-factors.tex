\section{Measuring gravitational form factors} 
\label{sec:EMT-FF}

There is no {\sl direct} way to measure the proton GFFs, as it would require measurements of the graviton-proton  interaction~\cite{Kobzarev:1962wt,Pagels:1966zza}. More recent theoretical developments have shown, however, that the GFFs may be probed {\sl indirectly} in various exclusive processes. This is the subject of
this section.

\subsection{Deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS)}
\label{DVCS}

In DVCS, the most explored process so far that accesses the GFFs,
high-energy charged leptons scatter off protons 
or nuclei by exchanging a deeply virtual photon,
producing a real photon in the final state
\cite{Muller:1994ses,Radyushkin:1996nd,Ji:1996nm}.

Similarly to DIS (see I.C), in the high-energy limit defined by $Q^2\to\infty$ and $P\cdot q\to\infty$ with $(-t)\ll Q^2$ and $P=(p'+p)/2$,
the process is described in QCD \cite{Collins:1998be} in terms of
the upper part of the handbag diagram shown in Fig.~\ref{DVCS-BH}a,
which can be calculated in perturbative QCD, and a lower part 
described in terms of generalized parton distributions 
(GPDs). GPDs are universal, i.e.,\ the same non-perturbative functions enter the description of different hard exclusive reactions. 

%GPDs are functions of $x$, $\xi$, and $t$, where the new quantity $\xi$ (called skewness) represents the longitudinal momentum transfer to the struck quark from the initial to the final state (see Fig.~\ref{DVCS-BH}a). In the high-energy limit,  $\xi \approx x_B/(2-x_B)$ and $t$ are the observables in DVCS, while $x$ enters the description of the DVCS amplitude only as an integration variable
{GPDs are functions of $x$, $\xi$, and $t$.

The variables $\xi$ and $t$ are observable in DVCS, while $x$ is not observable and enters the DVCS amplitude as an integration variable}.
GPDs encompass both PDFs and electromagnetic FFs 
discussed in Sec.~\ref{Sec-1:intro}.  
% Starting from GPDs, one recovers PDFs when $\xi\to 0$ and $t\to 0$; integrating particular GPDs over $x$ yields the electromagnetic FFs.
{For $p^\prime\to p$ implying $\xi\to 0$ and $t\to 0$, GPDs reduce to PDFs; integrating %particular 
the GPDs over $x$ yields the electromagnetic FFs.}

GPDs parameterize the matrix elements of 
certain non-local operators which can be expanded in 
terms of a series of local operators with various $J^{PC}$ quantum numbers.
This includes operators with the quantum numbers of 
the graviton ($J=2$), and so part of the information 
about how the proton would interact with a graviton is
encoded within this tower. As the electromagnetic coupling to quarks is many orders of magnitude stronger than gravity, the DVCS process is an effective tool to probe the proton's gravitational properties.  Gluon GPDs are accessible in DVCS
only at higher orders in $\alpha_s$. 

The leading contribution to DVCS is described in terms of four GPDs. Two of them, namely $H_q(x,\xi,t)$ and $E_q(x,\xi,t)$, give access to the quark GFFs as follows
\begin{equation}\label{mellin-1}
\begin{aligned}
\int_{-1}^{1} \mathrm{d}x \, x H_q(x, \xi, t)  = A_q(t) + \xi^2 D_q(t),\\
\int_{-1}^{1} \mathrm{d}x \, x E_q(x, \xi, t) = B_q(t) -
\xi^2 D_q(t) ,
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $B_q(t)=2J_q(t)-A_q(t)$
%. $B_q(0)$ is the quark contribution to the proton's anomalous gravitomagnetic moment. Analogous relations hold for gluons, and $B(0)=\sum_aB_a(0)$ vanishes~\cite{Kobzarev:1962wt,Teryaev:1999su,Brodsky:2000ii,Lowdon:2017idv,Cotogno:2019xcl,Lorce:2019sbq} due to the constraints~\eqref{Tconstraint} and~\eqref{Lconstraint}.

The actual observables in DVCS are Compton form factors (CFFs)
% e.g.~${\mathcal H}(\xi,t)$,  
{which are expressed by means of factorization formulae in terms of complex-valued convolution integrals given, at leading order $\alpha_s$, by}
\begin{multline} 
    \text{Re}{\mathcal H}(\xi,t) + i\, \text{Im}{\mathcal H}(\xi,t)  = \label{GPD-CFF} \\
    \sum_q e^2_q\int_{-1}^{1} dx \left[ \frac{1}{\xi-x-i\epsilon} -  \frac{1}{\xi+x-i\epsilon} \right] H_q(x,\xi,t),
\end{multline}
and similarly for the other GPDs. 
% Equation~(\ref{GPD-CFF}) is a factorization formula for the CFF $\mathcal{H}$. 
%\cedric{Its importance for the analysis of deeply exclusive processes is  discussed at the beginning of this section.}{} 
The CFFs % can be related to experimentally accessible 
are related to measurable quantities such as differential cross sections and beam and target polarization asymmetries.

and interferes with it. The

\end{figure}


The DVCS cross section is typically very small.
Fortunately, DVCS interferes with the Bethe-Heitler 
process, see Fig.~\ref{DVCS-BH}b, which can be computed in QED given the proton's electromagnetic FFs, and has the 
same final state but with the final state photon emitted 
from the electron lines. % see Fig.~\ref{DVCS-BH}b.
The interference term projects out Im${\mathcal H(\xi, t)}$
when a spin-polarized
electron beam is employed, while Re${\mathcal H(\xi, t)}$ 
contributes dominantly to the unpolarized DVCS cross section,
and may be constrained through precise unpolarized cross 
section measurements.

The convolution integrals like (\ref{GPD-CFF}) cannot be inverted in a model-independent way
to yield GPDs \cite{Bertone:2021yyz}. 
However, with experimental information from other exclusive processes becoming available (to be discussed below), the GPDs may be further constrained. Presently, a model-independent extraction of the GPDs
and, via 
(\ref{mellin-1}), of the GFFs $A_q(t)$ and $J_q(t)$ 
is not possible. In the case of the GFF $D_q(t)$, however, the situation is more fortunate. In particular, the real and imaginary parts of ${\mathcal H(\xi,t)}$
are related by the fixed-$t$ dispersion relation 
\cite{Diehl:2007jb,Anikin:2007tx} 
\begin{multline}
 {\rm Re}{\mathcal H}(\xi,t) = \mathcal C_{\mathcal H}(t) \\+\frac{ 1}{\pi} \,{\text{P.V.}} \int_0^1 \text{d}\xi' \left[\frac{1}{\xi-\xi'}  -\frac{1}{\xi+\xi'}\right] {\rm Im}{\mathcal H}(\xi',t), \label{DR}
\end{multline}
where $\text{P.V.}$ denotes the Cauchy's principal value of the integral. This expression contains a real subtraction term $\mathcal C_{\mathcal H}(t)$ given by 
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal C_{\mathcal H}(t)=2\sum_qe^2_q\int_{-1}^1\ud z\,\frac{D^q_\text{term}(z,t)}{1-z},
\end{equation}
where $D^q_\text{term}(z,t)$, originally introduced in
\cite{Polyakov:1999gs}
and further elucidated in
\cite{Teryaev:2001qm},
has the expansion \cite{Goeke:2001tz}
\begin{equation}\label{Gegenbauer}
    D^q_\text{term}(z,t)=(1-z^2)\sum_{\text{odd}\,n}d^q_n(t)\,C^{3/2}_n(z)
\end{equation}
with $C^\alpha_n(z)$ the Gegenbauer polynomials
which diagon\-alize the leading-order evolution equations (the renormalization scale dependence is not indicated throughout this work).
In the limit of renormalization scale $\mu\to\infty$,
all $d^q_n(t)$ go to zero except $d^q_1(t)$, which is 
related to the GFF $D_q(t)$ as follows
\begin{equation}\label{Dtermint}
    D_q(t) = \frac{4}{5}\, d^q_1(t) =
    \int_{-1}^1\ud z\,z\,D^q_\text{term}(z,t) \,.
\end{equation}
Thus, extracting information on 
Im${\mathcal H(\xi,t)}$ and Re${\mathcal H(\xi,t)}$ and their scale dependence from experimental data provides access to the GFF $D_q(t)$.

\subsection{DVCS with positron and electron beams}

When data with both positron and electron beams are available, 
it is possible to measure the beam charge asymmetry $A_C$ defined as the difference in the $ep\to ep\gamma$ cross section when measured with an electron beam and measured with a positron beam, divided by their sum
\begin{eqnarray}
A_C = \frac{\sigma_{}^{e^-}-\sigma_{}^{e^+}}{\sigma_{}^{e^-}+\sigma_{}^{e^+}}. 
\end{eqnarray} 
% It can be shown that 
The numerator of $A_C$ is given
by the real part of the DVCS and Bethe-Heitler interference term providing the cleanest access to Re$\mathcal{H}$ \cite{Kivel:2000fg,Belitsky:2001ns}. 
In contrast to this, in DVCS measured with electrons (or positrons)
alone, additional theoretical assumptions in the CFF extraction procedure 
are unavoidable~\cite{CLAS:2021gwi}.

\subsection{\boldmath $\gamma\gamma^\ast\to\pi^0\pi^0$}
\label{Subsec:Jpsi-pi0-GDA}

\vspace{-2mm}

The process $\gamma\gamma^\ast\to\pi^0\pi^0$ shown in 
Fig.~\ref{Jpsi-gamma-gamma-pi-pi}a
can be studied, e.g., at electron-positron
colliders, and is described in terms of generalized 
distribution amplitudes which correspond to GPDs 
continued analytically from the $t$- to the $s$-channel~\cite{Muller:1994ses,Diehl:1998dk}.
In this way, one can access information
on GFFs in the time-like region where $t>0$~\cite{Kumano:2017lhr,Lorce:2022tiq}.
This process provides a unique opportunity to study 
the structure of unstable hadrons like pions that are not available
as targets.



\subsection{Time-like Compton scattering and double DVCS} 

Several other processes provide complementary 
information about the nucleon GFFs. One of them
is time-like Compton scattering (TCS), $\gamma p \to p'\gamma^\ast$,
where the final state virtual photon produces 
an $e^+e^-$ pair \cite{Berger:2001xd,Pire:2011st,CLAS:2021lky}.
In TCS, Im$\mathcal{H}$ can be accessed through the polarized beam 
spin asymmetry and Re$\mathcal{H}$ through a forward-backward
asymmetry of the final-state $e^+e^-$ pair
in its centre-of-mass frame.

    virtual meson production (b).

    is the nonperturbative distribution amplitude. 
    \label{fig:ddvcs-dvmp}}
\end{figure}

The double DVCS process~\cite{Belitsky:2002tf,Guidal:2002kt} displayed in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:ddvcs-dvmp}a may also play an important role at future facilities. 
It is a variant of DVCS 
with the final-state time-like photon converting into a $e^+e^-$ or $\mu^+\mu^-$  pair.
While in DVCS the GPDs are sampled along the lines
$x=\pm\xi$ in the convolution integrals (\ref{GPD-CFF}), 
this constraint is relaxed in double DVCS due 
to the variable invariant mass of the  
lepton pair. This 
is an advantage of this process, and 
will be of importance for less model-dependent global extractions of GPDs. 

\subsection{Meson production}
\label{meson production}

Deeply virtual meson production 
\cite{Collins:1996fb}
is another process sensitive to 
GPDs, see Fig.~\ref{fig:ddvcs-dvmp}b.
Production of different vector mesons provides 
sensitivity to GPDs of different quark flavors
which is an advantage over DVCS. 
However, this process is more difficult to analyze
than DVCS since gluons contribute on the same
footing as quarks (Fig.~\ref{fig:ddvcs-dvmp}b
only shows a quark diagram) and one 
in general expects larger power corrections.
{Also the process of heavy vector quarkonium photoproduction was shown to factorize in the heavy quark limit at one-loop order in perturbative QCD \cite{Ivanov:2004vd}.}

Exclusive $J/\Psi$ photo-production at threshold,
is expected to be sensitive to gluon GFFs \cite{Kharzeev:1995ij,Kharzeev:2021qkd} and more generally, as depicted in Fig.~\ref{Jpsi-gamma-gamma-pi-pi}b, to gluon GPDs \cite{Hatta:2018ina,Guo:2021ibg}, 
which in DVCS are accessible only at higher orders in $\alpha_s$.
% The process of heavy vector quarkonium photoproduction was shown to factorize in the heavy quark limit at one-loop order in perturbative QCD \cite{Ivanov:2004vd}. 

Gluon GFFs have recently been extracted from this process by \cite{Duran:2022xag}, but the link with the physical observables is not direct and requires approximations \cite{Sun:2021gmi,Sun:2021pyw}, similarly to DVCS. $J/\Psi$ photoproduction can also be studied with quasi-real photons of virtualities as low as $Q^2 \lesssim 0.1\,{\rm GeV}^2$ emitted by electrons, 
together with electroproduction and DVCS.

Finally, a new class of hard scattering processes with multi-particle final states
has recently emerged~\cite{Qiu:2022bpq,Pedrak:2020mfm,Grocholski:2022rqj,
Ivanov:2002jj,Boussarie:2016qop,Duplancic:2018bum}. 
Those reactions are theoretically appealing, but measuring them is challenging.

%Sec.~\ref{experiments} will focus on DVCS and TCS as the most suitable processes for near-future studies of proton CFFs.
{The relatively recent progress reviewed here paved the way to the exciting and even more recent experimental developments, which will be reviewed in Sec.~\ref{experiments} with a focus on DVCS and TCS.
Before continuing, the next section is devoted to the theory of GFFs, whose history is equally interesting and began much earlier.}

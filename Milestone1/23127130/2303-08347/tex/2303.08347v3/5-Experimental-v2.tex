\section{Experimental results}
\label{experiments}

This section presents a discussion of the DVCS data and the analysis procedure that led to the first extraction of the proton $D$-term form factor $D_q(t)$ from data collected with the CLAS detector at 
Jefferson Lab (JLab). The extraction of $D_q(t)$ of  {$\pi^0$} from Belle data, and other phenomenological results, are also reviewed.

%In this section, the past, current and planned DVCS experiments are briefly reviewed. Experimental measurements of DVCS are difficult as they require high luminosity to measure small cross sections with polarized electron, positron or muon beams at different energies, and employing polarized nucleon targets, both longitudinal and transverse, to measure observables with sensitivity to different combinations of CFFs. The measurements also require advanced detection capabilities to ensure reaction exclusivity in a wide  range in kinematics.

The first measurements of DVCS on unpolarized protons were carried out with the H1~\cite{H1:2001nez} experiment and later with the ZEUS~\cite{ZEUS:2003pwh}~ experiment, both at the HERA collider.  
The first observation of the $\sin(\phi)$-dependence for the $ {\vec e} p \rightarrow e'p'\gamma $ process as signature of the interference of the DVCS and Bethe-Heitler amplitudes came from the CLAS \cite{CLAS:2001wjj} and HERMES \cite{HERMES:2001bob} detectors.

%while the H1 \cite{H1:2001nez} and ZEUS \cite{ZEUS:2003pwh} collaborations measured, for the first time, the DVCS cross sections with both electron and positron beams on unpolarized protons in the kinematic domain of $x_B < 0.01$.

These initial results triggered the development of a worldwide dedicated experimental program to measure the DVCS process with  high precision and in a large kinematic range with HERMES at HERA, Hall A and CLAS at JLab, and COMPASS at CERN.
%\volker{}{An overview of the experimental program may be found in~\cite{XXX}.} 
A review of the early DVCS experiments can be found in \cite{dHose:2016mda}.

%This experimental program required major construction projects, and new detector and accelerator upgrades employing state-of-the-art technologies.
%
%HERMES provided a set of observables with different experimental conditions, electron and positron beams with both longitudinal and transverse spin polarizations for the lepton and proton \cite{HERMES:2011bou}. These data had an important impact in the initial development and constraint of GPD models and  the first global fits. Although HERMES was able to provide a complete set of DVCS measurements, the HERA machine operated at very low luminosity providing only low-statistics results until HERMES ended operation in 2007.

%The COMPASS experiment took first DVCS data in a pilot run in 2012 with 160~GeV of oppositely polarised $\mu^+$ and $\mu^-$ beams~\cite{COMPASS:2018pup}. The average of the measured $\mu^+$ and $\mu^-$ cross sections allows for the determination of Im$\cal{H}$. Results from an order of magnitude higher statistics obtained in 2016 and 2017 will soon be available. With these new data, the difference of $\mu^+$ and $\mu^-$ cross sections can also be formed to provide access to Re$\cal{H}$.

%In the 6 GeV era of JLab, dedicated DVCS experiments were designed and performed at low to moderate $Q^2$ in the region $x_B\approx 1/3$ involving modest upgrades to the detectors and the operating luminosity. The first dedicated experiment was the DVCS cross section measurements in Hall A, resulting in a first $Q^2$-scaling test \cite{JeffersonLabHallA:2006prd}. 

%Special detector configurations were incorporated with the construction of new equipment that doubled the luminosity the CLAS detector is able to operate at, to $2\times 10^{34}$\,cm$^{-2}$\,s$^{-1}$. The CLAS collaboration has  measured DVCS beam spin asymmetries and cross sections \cite{CLAS:2007clm,CLAS:2015uuo} and longitudinally polarized target-spin asymmetries \cite{CLAS:2006krx,CLAS:2014qtk,CLAS:2015bqi}. The high statistical accuracy of the data collected in the large kinematic range of CLAS was essential for the first extraction of information on the proton $D$-term. This opened up the experimental investigation of the gravitational structure of the proton. The details of the high-level analysis will be described in the second part of this section.

%One of the primary motivations of the 12~GeV energy upgrade at JLab was the study of the 3D structure of the nucleon by measurement of deeply exclusive processes with DVCS as the flagship program. In addition to the accelerator upgrade, this required a major upgrade to the experimental equipment from CLAS to CLAS12~\cite{Burkert:2020akg} with an order of magnitude increase in luminosity and an upgrade of Hall C. A comprehensive DVCS program has been approved as a major part of the 12~GeV science program. It incorporates experiments with polarized electron beams and energies from 6 to 11 GeV, longitudinally polarized hydrogen and deuterium targets, as well as conditionally approved measurements with transversely polarized proton targets, and with positron beams.  

%The first high-precision results of DVCS cross sections measured at 12~GeV in Hall A, focused on high values of the Bjorken variable $x_B$, have been published~\cite{JeffersonLabHallA:2022pnx}. The results of beam-spin asymmetry measurements at different energies with CLAS12 are in the public domain~\cite{CLAS:2022syx}. The comprehensive DVCS measurements expected from JLab with the 12~GeV capabilities will significantly improve our understanding of the mechanical structure of the proton. 

\subsection{First extraction of
the proton GFF \boldmath $D_q(t)$}
\label{Subsec:D-term-at-JLab}

In this section, the data and procedure used in~\cite{Burkert:2018bqq} to obtain the first determination of the quark contribution to the $D$-term of the proton are described. This work is based on two main pieces of experimental 
information from the CLAS detector at JLab~\cite{CLAS:2003umf}, namely the beam-spin 
asymmetry (BSA) measured with spin-polarized electron beams, and the unpolarized cross section for DVCS 
on the proton. 

The polarization asymmetries and differential cross sections have been used to extract the imaginary and real parts of the CFF ${\cal H}$ respectively. Using the 
dispersion relation technique to determine the subtraction term $\mathcal C_{\mathcal H}(t)$, as discussed in section \ref{DVCS}, requires the full integral over $0 \leq \xi \leq 1$ at fixed $t$ to be evaluated. As this process requires an extrapolation to both $\xi=0$ and to $\xi=1$ that are unreachable in experiments, a parameterization of the $\xi$-dependence of Im$\mathcal{H}$ close to these limits  has been incorporated to fit the data. 

In the first step, fits of the BSA~\cite{CLAS:2007clm} and of the unpolarized differential cross-sections~\cite{CLAS:2015uuo} for DVCS were performed to estimate Im${\mathcal H(\xi,t)}$ and Re${\mathcal H(\xi,t)}$ at fixed kinematics in $\xi$ and $t$ in the ranges covered by the data. The BSA is defined as 
\begin{eqnarray}
A_{LU}(\xi, t) = \frac{N^+(\xi, t) - N^-(\xi, t)}{N^+(\xi, t) + N^-(\xi, t) } ,
\end{eqnarray}
where $N^+$ and $N^-$ refer to the  measured event rates at electron helicity $+1$ and $-1$, respectively. 


The experimentally-measured BSA in $\vec{e} p \to e p \gamma$ contains not only the DVCS term, with the photon generated at the proton vertex, but also the Bethe-Heitler term with the photon generated at the incoming or scattered electron, respectively (see Fig.~\ref{DVCS-BH}). Both have the same final state and thus interfere. They generate a $\sin\phi$-dependent interference contribution as seen in Fig.~\ref{BSA-DVCS-BH}. The DVCS term is dominated by the CFF Im$\mathcal{H}$ and the Bethe-Heitler term is real and is given by the elastic electromagnetic FFs.  

It is important to note that this analysis does not rely on extracted cross sections but on asymmetries of event rates in specific bins. This is an essential 
advantage 
as it avoids accounting for systematic uncertainties that must be included in the cross section extraction. The uncertainties in $A_{LU}(\xi,t)$ are dominated by statistics rather than systematic uncertainties, which determines the local values of Im$\mathcal{H}$ very precisely as can be seen in the top panel of Fig. \ref{BSA-DVCS-BH}, which shows the BSA and the differential cross sections for selected kinematic bins.

In the second step, the 
Im$\mathcal{H}(\xi,t)$ are fit with the functional form used in global fits~\cite{Muller:2013jur,Kumericki:2016ehc} with the parameters fit to the local CLAS data. The imaginary part is written as:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
{\textrm{Im}}\mathcal{H}(\xi,t) =  \frac{\mathcal N}{1+\xi}\frac{\left(\frac{2\xi}{1+\xi}\right)^{-\alpha(t)}\left(\frac{1-\xi}{1+\xi}\right)^b}{ \left(1-\frac{1-\xi}{1+\xi}\frac{t}{M^2}\right)^{p}}, \label{km-para} 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal N$ is a free normalization constant, $\alpha(t)$ is fixed from small-$x$ Regge phenomenology as $\alpha(t)=0.43+0.85\,t~\text{GeV}^{-2}$,
$b$ is a free parameter controlling the large-$x$ behavior, $p$ is fixed to 1 for the valence quarks, and $M$ is a free parameter controlling the $t$-dependence.   


The real and imaginary part are fit together including the subtraction term in the dispersion relation~\eqref{DR}.  
Fig.~\ref{CFF} compares the fits at fixed kinematics (local fits) with the global fit 
for one of the $t$ values. The global and local fits show good agreement in $\xi$ and $t$ kinematics where they overlap.

In the  
fit, $\mathcal C_{\mathcal H}(t)$ is obtained at fixed  
$t$. The results for the subtraction term and the fit to the multipole form
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal C_{\mathcal H}(t) &=& \mathcal C_{\mathcal H}(0) \bigg[1 + \frac{(-t)}{M^2}\bigg]^{-\lambda} \label{multipole} \\  \nonumber
\end{eqnarray} 
are displayed in Fig.~\ref{Dt}, where $\mathcal C_{\mathcal H}(0)$, $\lambda$ and $M^2$ are the fit parameters, with their values found to be: 
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
\mathcal C_{\mathcal H}(0) &=-2.27\pm 0.16 \pm 0.36,  
\\ 
M^2 &=1.02\pm  0.13 \pm 0.21  {\rm ~GeV^2},  \\ 
 \lambda &=2.76 \pm  0.23 \pm 0.48. 
\end{aligned}
\label{parameters}
\end{equation} 
 \noindent The first error is the fit uncertainty, and the second error is due to the systematic uncertainties.
Adding the fit errors for $\mathcal C_{\mathcal H}(0)$ and the systematic errors in quadrature $\sigma_{\mathcal C_{\mathcal H}(0) } = \sqrt{0.16^2 + 0.36^2} \approx  0.39$, 
the significance $S$ of the knowledge of the subtraction term is: 
\begin{eqnarray}
S = \frac{\mathcal C_{\mathcal H}(0) }{\sigma_{\mathcal C_{\mathcal H}(0)}} \approx 5.8.
\end{eqnarray}
More flexible analyses based on unconstrained artificial neural network techniques~\cite{Kumericki:2019ddg,Dutrieux:2021nlz} find however that a more conservative extraction of the subtraction constant from the currently available experimental data remains compatible with zero within large uncertainties.

\caption{The TCS polarized BSA (top) and the TCS $A_{FB}$ (bottom) for an average  1.8~GeV mass of the time-like photon $M_{e^+e^-}$. A value for $A_{LU}$ of (20-25)\% is consistent with what is measured in DVCS and projects out Im${\cal H}$. The FBA projects out Re${\cal H}$ that relates directly to the protons $D_q(t)$-term. Graphics adapted from ~\cite{CLAS:2021lky}. 
The data require the presence of the $D$-term as seen in the difference of the dashed magenta line and the solid red line. At the kinematics of the data in Fig.~\ref{Dt},
about half of the asymmetry may be due to the $D$-term 
when comparing calculations without and with the 
$D$-term~\cite{Vanderhaeghen:1999xj,Pasquini:2014vua}.}
\label{TCS-BSA-FBA}
\end{figure}
In the analysis of~\cite{Burkert:2018bqq}, the term $d_3^q(t)$ and other higher-order terms have been omitted in the expansion~\eqref{Gegenbauer} to extract the GFF $D_q(t)$. The estimated effect is included in the systematic error analysis. It is also assumed that $u$ and $d$ quarks have the same first moments $d_1^u \approx d_1^d \approx {d_1^{u+d} /2}$, an assumption justified in the large-$N_c$ limit~\cite{Goeke:2001tz}. Under these approximations, it follows from~\eqref{Dtermint} that
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal C_{\mathcal H}(t)\approx\frac{10}{9}\,d_1^{u+d}(t) = \frac{25}{18}\,D_{u+d}(t).    
\label{F7}
\end{eqnarray}
The truncation in~\eqref{Gegenbauer} leads to a systematic uncertainty of a priori unknown magnitude. For $Q^2\to\infty$, the higher order terms $d^q_3, d^q_5,\cdots$ vanish. But at the $Q^2$ that can be reached in the current experiments, they are not necessarily negligible.    
The results of the chiral quark-soliton model, which predicts values of $d^{u+d}_1$ close to findings
in the experimental analysis~\cite{Goeke:2007fp}, can been used to estimate the contribution of the $d_3^q$ term. At the kinematics relevant for this analysis a ratio $d^{u+d}_3/d^{u+d}_1 \approx 0.3$ was found~\cite{Kivel:2000fg}. A systematic uncertainty of $\delta(d^{u+d}_1)/d^{u+d}_1 =\pm 0.30$ has therefore been included into the results of~\cite{Burkert:2018bqq} for $d_1^{u+d}(t)$.

One may ask if the first two terms in the Gegenbauer polynomial expansion $d_1^q(t)$ and $d_3^q(t)$ could be separated in some way to reduce the systematics. This has been studied in~\cite{Dutrieux:2021nlz} by including the $Q^2$-evolution into the phenomenological analysis. It was found that, assuming the same $t$-dependence, the two terms cannot currently be separated given the limited range in $Q^2$ covered by the data. In the future one may expect Lattice QCD to be able to provide a model-independent evaluation of this higher-order contribution. 


To conclude this section, the determination of $\mathcal C_{\mathcal H}(t)$ suggests that the quark contribution $\sum_qD_q(t)$ to the proton's GFF $D(t)$ is non-zero and large. These results have been supported in a recent paper on the first measurement of TCS~\cite{CLAS:2021lky} as shown in Fig.~\ref{TCS-BSA-FBA}, where the contribution of the $D$-term to the forward-backward asymmetry is seen to be 
significant. Moreover, predictions in the 
chiral quark-soliton model \cite{Goeke:2007fp} and from dispersive analysis~\cite{Pasquini:2014vua} shown in Fig.~\ref{Dt} are consistent with the results discussed here within the systematic uncertainties.     


\subsection{Other measurements and phenomenological studies}

The first extraction of the $\pi^0$ GFFs in the time-like region based on the process $\gamma \gamma^* \to \pi^0 \pi^0$, depicted in Fig.~\ref{Jpsi-gamma-gamma-pi-pi}, which was measured in the Belle experiment in $e^+e^-$ collisions \cite{Belle:2015oin}, was obtained in \cite{Kumano:2017lhr}.
For the quark contribution to the $\pi^0$ $D$-term 
the value $\sum_qD_q(0)\approx - 0.75$ was reported, 
but systematic uncertainties have not been estimated.
It has recently been observed in~\cite{Lorce:2022tiq}
that kinematical corrections may significantly impact 
the extraction of generalized distribution amplitudes
from experimental data and should be taken into 
account in future analyses.

{
Based on data from experiments at JLab on the energy-dependence of $J/\Psi$ production at threshold~\cite{GlueX:2019mkq,Duran:2022xag}, phenomenological information on the gluon $D_G(t)$ form factor of the proton was extracted
\cite{Kharzeev:2021qkd,Kou:2021qdc,Wang:2022ndz} and estimates were obtained for the  gluon contributions to the proton mean square mass radius $\int\ud^3r\,r^2\mathcal T^{00}(\vec r)/M_N$ and the mean square scalar radius $\int\ud^3r\,r^2g_{\mu\nu}\mathcal T^{\mu\nu}(\vec r)/M_N$. The most recent data on this process were reported in \cite{GlueX:2023pev}.}
(For remarks on the theoretical status of this process

A similar study for the lighter
$\phi$-meson was presented in \cite{Hatta:2021can}.

\subsection{Future experimental developments to access GFFs}

As discussed in section III, measurements of DVCS have so far been most effective in obtaining information related to GPDs. However, there are different experimental processes that may be employed to provide additional, or independent, information on the GPDs and GFFs.  

Implementation of a high-duty-cycle positron source, both polarized and unpolarized~\cite{PEPPo:2016saj}, at JLab would significantly enhance its capabilities in the extraction of the CFF  Re$\mathcal{H}(\xi,t)$ and thus of the gravitational form factor $D_q(t)$ and of the mechanical properties of the proton.  

The time-like Compton scattering process will be measured in parallel to the DVCS process employing the large acceptance detector systems such as CLAS12~\cite{Burkert:2020akg}. The TCS event rate is much reduced compared to DVCS and requires higher luminosity for similar sensitivity to $\mathcal{H}$. 
In experiments employing large acceptance detector 
systems, both the DVCS and TCS processes are measured 
simultaneously, in quasi-real photo-production at very small $Q^2 \to 0$, and in real photo-production, where
the external production target acts as a radiator of 
real photons that undergo TCS further downstream 
in the same target cell. 

The double DVCS process enables access to GPDs in their full kinematic dependencies on $x, \xi, t$, see Sec.~\ref{sec:EMT-FF}. At the same time it is reduced in rate by orders of magnitude compared to 
DVCS~\cite{Kopeliovich:2010xm}  
requiring  
higher luminosity than is currently achievable. 
Nevertheless, special equipment that would 
comply with such requirements has been proposed~\cite{Chen:2014psa}. Such measurements are currently planned at JLab in Hall A and  
Hall B. 
 
   
Finally, an energy-doubling of the existing electron accelerator at JLab is currently under consideration~\cite{Arrington:2021alx}. This upgrade would   extend the DVCS program to higher $Q^2$ and lower $x_B$ and better link the DVCS measurements at the current 12 GeV operation to the kinematic reach that will be available at the Electron-Ion Collider, a flagship future facility in preparation at the Brookhaven National Laboratory (discussed further below). It will also more fully open the charm sector to access the gluon GFFs. %\volker{The energy upgrade will be essential for a comprehensive measurement of deeply exclusive meson production, both in the vector meson and the pseudo-scalar meson sector.}

    "abstract": "The physics of the gravitational form factors of the proton, and their understanding within quantum chromodynamics, has advanced significantly in the past two decades through both theory and experiment. This Colloquium provides an overview of this progress, highlights the physical insights unveiled by studies of gravitational form factors, and reviews their interpretation in terms of the mechanical properties of the proton.",

	title = {Steady state entropy production rate for scalar {L}angevin field theories},
	journal = {J. Stat. Mech. Theory Exp.},
	abstract = {The entropy production rate (EPR) offers a quantitative measure of time reversal symmetry breaking in non-equilibrium systems. It can be defined either at particle level or at the level of coarse-grained fields such as density; the EPR for the latter quantifies the extent to which these coarse-grained fields behave irreversibly. In this work, we first develop a general method to compute the EPR of scalar {L}angevin field theories with additive noise. This large class of theories includes active versions of model A (non-conserved density dynamics) and model B (conserved) and also models where both types of dynamics are simultaneously present (such as model AB (2020 J. Stat. Mech. 05206)). Treating the scalar field ϕ (and its time derivative ) as the sole observable(s), we arrive at an expression for the EPR that is non-negative for every field configuration and is quadratic in the time-antisymmetric component of the dynamics. Our general expression is a function of the quasipotential, which determines the full probability distribution for configurations, and is not generally calculable. To alleviate this difficulty, we present a small-noise expansion of the EPR, which only requires knowledge of the deterministic (mean-field) solution for the scalar field in steady state, which generally is calculable, at least numerically. We demonstrate this calculation for the case of model AB (2020 J. Stat. Mech. 05206). We then present a similar EPR calculation for model AB with the conservative and non-conservative contributions to viewed as separately observable quantities. The results are qualitatively different, confirming that the field-level EPR depends on the choice of coarse-grained information retained within the dynamical description.}

	abstract = { Self-propelled particles include both self-phoretic synthetic colloids and various microorganisms. By continually consuming energy, they bypass the laws of equilibrium thermodynamics. These laws enforce the Boltzmann distribution in thermal equilibrium: The steady state is then independent of kinetic parameters. In contrast, self-propelled particles tend to accumulate where they move more slowly. They may also slow down at high density for either biochemical or steric reasons. This creates positive feedback, which can lead to motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) between dense and dilute fluid phases. At leading order in gradients, a mapping relates variable-speed, self-propelled particles to passive particles with attractions. This deep link to equilibrium phase separation is confirmed by simulations but generally breaks down at higher order in gradients: New effects, with no equilibrium counterpart, then emerge. We give a selective overview of the fast-developing field of MIPS, focusing on theory and simulation but including a brief speculative survey of its experimental implications. }

	abstract = {A stochastic process is any process describing the evolution in time of a random phenomenon. From a mathematical point of view, the theory of stochastic processes was settled around 1950. Since then, stochastic processes have become a common tool for mathematicians, physicists, engineers, and the field of application of this theory ranges from the modeling of stock pricing, to a rational option pricing theory, to differential geometry. As written in the introduction of the book of F. Knight (1981):The prospect of writing … on the branch of mathematics which is generally associated with [Brownian motion], necessarily produces a considerable amount of hesitation and temerity in the prospective author. We have chosen to present here some aspects of the theory of stochastic processes through its historical evolution and tried to focus on some examples and applications.}

	abstract = {The Fokker–Planck equation is studied through its relation to a Schrödinger-type equation. The advantage of this combination is that we can construct the probability distribution of the Fokker–Planck equation by using well-known solutions of the Schrödinger equation. By making use of such a combination, we present the solution of the Fokker–Planck equation for a bistable potential related to a double oscillator. Thus, we can observe the temporal evolution of the system describing its dynamic properties such as the time τ to overcome the barrier. By calculating the rates k=1/τ as a function of the inverse scaled temperature 1/D, where D is the diffusion coefficient, we compare the aspect of the curve k×1/D, with the ones obtained from other studies related to four different kinds of activated process. We notice that there are similarities in some ranges of the scaled temperatures, where the different processes follow the Arrhenius behavior. We propose that the type of bistable potential used in this study may be used, qualitatively, as a simple model, whose rates share common features with the rates of some single rate-limited thermally activated processes.}

By a stability analysis of the field theory, we obtain equations for the spinodal that describes the onset of a motility-induced instability leading to cluster formation in such mixtures. The prediction for the spinodal is found to be in good agreement with particle-resolved computer simulations. Furthermore, we show that in active-passive mixtures the spinodal instability can be of two different types. One type is associated with a stationary bifurcation and occurs also in one-component active systems, whereas the other type is associated with a Hopf bifurcation and can occur only in active-passive mixtures. Remarkably, the Hopf bifurcation leads to moving clusters. This explains recent results from simulations of active-passive particle mixtures, where moving clusters and interfaces that are not seen in the corresponding one-component systems have been observed.}

Analytical solutions are limited to special cases, and resorting to numerical simulation is often the only route available; in high dimensions, or for parametric studies, this can become unwieldy. Using asymptotic techniques, that draw upon the known Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) case, we consider a mean-reverting system and obtain its representation as a product of terms, representing short-term, long-term, and medium-term behaviour. A further reduction yields a simple explicit formula, both intuitive in terms of its physical origin and fast to evaluate. We illustrate a breadth of cases, some of which are ‘far’ from the OU model, such as double-well potentials, and even then, perhaps surprisingly, the approximation still gives very good results when compared with numerical simulations. Both one- and two-dimensional examples are considered.}

	abstract = {This paper aims at providing a new angle to the classical thermodynamic description of the elastodynamics of solids at finite temperature via the simultaneous spatio-temporal coarse-graining of the atomistic Hamiltonian equations of motion. First, we show by means of various numerical examples, that the spectral kinetic energy density of atomistic trajectories as projected in the normal modes of the system, reveals the anticipated coupling between the spatial and temporal scales, as well as the separation between the elastic and thermal material behavior. The ratio between these two scales provides a single parameter ϵ, whose limit to zero, denotes the upscaling to the continuum scale in the limit of infinite length/time scale separation. The coarse-graining procedure for the identified slow (elastic) variables is then performed by combining mathematical results of Bornemann (2006) based on notions of weak convergence, and statistical mechanics results of Berdichevsky (1997). The resulting continuum description and relations, obtained in generalized coordinates, are all in complete agreement with well-known results in the thermodynamics of solids. Yet, the upscaling exercise delivers simple mathematical insight into some of these classical continuum expressions. Specifically, the potential structure of the reversible elastodynamic equations of motion, with the mechanical forces given by the derivatives of free energy at constant temperature, becomes quite apparent. In addition, the non-commutativity of weak limits and nonlinear functions provides a simple mathematical explanation for the temperature dependence of the mechanical properties of materials, or the fact that thermal energy is finite, while thermal vibrations are negligibly small at the continuum scale. The limit ϵ → 0 is also explored numerically for two examples of a beam undergoing elastic vibrations at various temperatures. The first example is an illustrative mass-spring system, where the atoms’ mass, interatomic distance and potentials are suitably scaled with ϵ, while the length of the beam remains constant; and the second example explores an iron beam of increasing length and fixed atomistic description. In both cases, the scaling of all quantities is analyzed in detail, and the coarse-grained description is compared to the behavior obtained via full atomistic simulations.}

Examples include all living organisms and their motile constituents such as molecular motors. This article reviews recent progress in applying the principles of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and hydrodynamics to form a systematic theory of the behavior of collections of active particles–active matter–with only minimal regard to microscopic details. A unified view of the many kinds of active matter is presented, encompassing not only living systems but inanimate analogs. Theory and experiment are discussed side by side. }

	abstract = {Publisher Summary
	This chapter discusses the systems coupled to two reservoirs of energy in such a way that there is a steady energy flow through the system. An example is a resistor in steady state, gaining energy from a battery and losing it to the atmosphere. Even for this restricted class there is no equivalent of Gibbs' framework and, typically, distributions cannot be expressed solely in terms of the internal energies of the system. Thus, in addition to the “technical difficulties” associated with computing averages in a many-body system, one must first solve the “more fundamental” problem of finding the stationary distribution. For systems, which are only weakly perturbed so that they remain “close to equilibrium,” much is known at the level of linear response. The chapter focuses on steady states “far from equilibrium” where such schemes break down. Against this backdrop of a vast theoretical terra incognita, a reasonable approach consists in investigating systems which, while retaining the essence of the difficulties of “far from equilibrium” states, are as simple as possible. In this very spirit, Lenz suggested the Ising model in an attempt to understand the nature of ferromagnetic phase transitions. This philosophy provides one of the main motivations behind the introduction of a simple non-equilibrium system, which is referred to as the “standard model.”}

The absolute continuity of a measure induced by a process with process depending diffusion w.r.t. a quasi translation invariant measure is investigated. The orthogonality of these measures w.r.t. quasi translation invariant measures is shown. It is concluded that the Onsager-Machlup function cannot be defined as a Lagrangian for processes with process depending diffusion coefficients.},

	abstract = {The flux from random solute movements, Brownian motion, is added to the diffusion equation for spinodal decomposition. The resulting equation for the time dependence of the diffuse intensity accounts for the several discrepancies between theory and experiment which have been observed during the very early stages of spinodal decomposition. The influence of Brownian motion on the rate of change of the diffuse intensity is characterized by a thermal driving force proportional to kBT where kB is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature. The observed critical wave vector depends on the initial intensity distribution and occurs at the wave vector for which the thermal driving force is balanced by the usual thermodynamic driving force. The equation can also be used to study the early stages of homogeneous nucleation (G-P zone formation) on aging a quenched specimen outside the spinodal.
	Résumé
	Pour la décomposition spinodale, les auteurs introduisent dans l'équation de diffusion le flux provenant du mouvement Brownien du soluté. L'équation résultante relative à la variation de l'intensité de diffusion en fonction du temps tient compte de plusieurs divergences existant entre la théorie et l'expérience, qui ont été observées au cours des tout premiers stades de la décomposition spinodale. L'influence du mouvement Brownien sur le taux de variation avec le temps de l'intensité de diffusion est caractérisée par une force directrice thermique proportionnelle à kBT, où kB est la constante de Boltzmann et T la température. Le vecteur d'onde critique observé dépend de la distribution initiale de l'intensité et correspond au vecteur d'onde pour lequel la force directrice thermique est équilibrée par la force directrice thermodynamique classique. L'équation peut être utilisée également pour étudier les premiers stades de la germination homogène (formation de la zone de Guinier-Preston) au cours du vieillissement d'un échantillon trempé en dehors de la spinodale.
	Zusammenfassung
	Der von der willkürlichen Bewegung der Fremdatome, d.h. ihrer Brownschen Bewegung, herrührende Fluß wird zur Diffusionsgleichung der spinodalen Entmischung addiert. Die resultierende Gleichung für die Zeitabhängigkeit der diffusen Intensität erklärt mehrere, in den Anfangsstadien der spinodalen Entmischung beobachtete Widersprüche zwischen Theorie und Experiment. Der Einfluß der Brownschen Bewegung auf die Änderung der diffusion Intensität wird durch eine thermische treibende Kraft beschrieben, die proportional zu kBT ist; dabei ist kB die Boltzmannkonstante und T die Temperatur. Der beobachtete kritische Wellenvektor hängt von der anfänglichen Intensitätsverteilung ab; es ist der Wellenvektor, für den die thermische mit der üblichen thermodynamischen treibenden Kraft im Gleichgewicht ist. Die Gleichung kann auch zur Untersuchung der Anfangsstadien der homogenen Keimbildung (Bildung von GP-Zonen) bei der Alterung abgeschreckter Proben auß erhalb der Spinodalen benützt werden.}

With further growth of the bifurcation parameter, two higher (secondary) bifurcations are revealed, one transforming the stationary solution into a travelling wave, the other one giving rise to “ripples” on its “crest”. In the case of the long-wave instability, stationary periodic solutions also arise, but, generally speaking, they are not quasiharmonic, and their stability criterion cannot be expressed in a universal form.}

	abstract = { The goal of this review article is to assess how relevant is the concept of dissipative structure for understanding the dynamical bases of non-equilibrium self-organization in biological systems, and to see where it has been applied in the five decades since it was initially proposed by Ilya Prigogine. Dissipative structures can be classified into four types, which will be considered, in turn, and illustrated by biological examples: (i) multistability, in the form of bistability and tristability, which involve the coexistence of two or three stable steady states, or in the form of birhythmicity, which involves the coexistence between two stable rhythms; (ii) temporal dissipative structures in the form of sustained oscillations, illustrated by biological rhythms; (iii) spatial dissipative structures, known as Turing patterns; and (iv) spatio-temporal structures in the form of propagating waves. Rhythms occur with widely different periods at all levels of biological organization, from neural, cardiac and metabolic oscillations to circadian clocks and the cell cycle; they play key roles in physiology and in many disorders. New rhythms are being uncovered while artificial ones are produced by synthetic biology. Rhythms provide the richest source of examples of dissipative structures in biological systems. Bistability has been observed experimentally, but has primarily been investigated in theoretical models in an increasingly wide range of biological contexts, from the genetic to the cell and animal population levels, both in physiological conditions and in disease. Bistable transitions have been implicated in the progression between the different phases of the cell cycle and, more generally, in the process of cell fate specification in the developing embryo. Turing patterns are exemplified by the formation of some periodic structures in the course of development and by skin stripe patterns in animals. Spatio-temporal patterns in the form of propagating waves are observed within cells as well as in intercellular communication. This review illustrates how dissipative structures of all sorts abound in biological systems. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Dissipative structures in matter out of equilibrium: from chemistry, photonics and biology (part 1)’. }

In particular, macroscopically ordered states (dissipative structures) can arise in them spontaneously. This study discusses the fundamental results of the theory of dissipative structures: potential multiplicity of states differing in type of spatial organization, the possibility of both spontaneous and induced transitions between these states, and a universal description of the dynamics of establishment of macroscopic order. The capability of self-organization of a broad set of physicochemical systems opens up the possibility of modeling processes of desymmetrization and complication of spatial organization during the embryonic development of multicellular organisms. The article reflects the most significant results in this field.}

As physicists, we have learned much about natural pattern formation in recent years; we have discovered how rich this subject can be, and how very much remains to be understood.

For case of presentation the theory is developed using model equations. Wavenumber selection, the shape of patterns, stability and the time dependence resulting from long wavelength instabilities are discussed. The effects of adding the local mean drift important in low Prandtl number situations are investigated. Our theory includes the notion of the Busse stability balloon, reduces near critical values of the stress parameter to the Newell-Whitehead-Segel equations, and contains the Pomeau-Manneville phase equation. It also gives a detailed description of the way in which the field amplitude, which is slaved to the phase gradient away from threshold, becomes an independent order parameter near the critical point.}

Thus they have infinitely many degrees of freedom; accordingly, it came as a surprise at the end of the seventies that such systems can exhibit low dimensional chaos which is characteristic of systems with few degrees of freedom. In the meanwhile this miracle has been fully understood. By keeping a fluid in a box which is not too large compared to some typical macroscopic scale (like the size of a convection roll) one can maintain spatial coherence but the system will become temporally chaotic. Only a few spatial modes get appreciably excited, and their amplitudes define a low-dimensional ``phase-space'' in which the chaotic dynamics takes place.",

This theorem may be represented by a stochastic equation describing the fluctuation, which is a generalization of the familiar {L}angevin equation in the classical theory of Brownian motion. In this generalized equation the friction force becomes retarded or frequency-dependent and the random force is no more white. They are related to each other by a generalized Nyquist theorem which is in fact another expression of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. This point of view can be applied to a wide class of irreversible process including collective modes in many-particle systems as has already been shown by Mori. As an illustrative example, the density response problem is briefly discussed.}

Here the temporal and spatial patterns in natural plankton communities are interpreted as transient and stationary non-equilibrium solutions of dynamical nonlinear interaction-diffusion-advection systems. The analysis of a simple model of phytoplankton-zooplankton dynamics in space and time is presented. Nutrients and planktivorous fish are not treated separately, but they act as environmental control variables. After summarizing the local properties, the emergence of spatial and spatio-temporal patterns is considered. Conditions for the formation of spatial patterns after the diffusive instability of a uniform species distribution are derived, and numerical results of diffusive as well as shear-diffusive patterning are presented on a two-dimensional spatial cross-section. The variability of phytoplankton growth due to its light sensitivity is considered in a linear approximation. Multiple stability, oscillations, the propagation of planktic fronts as well as stationary and drifting patches are presented. }

The dense phase is classified into seven structure types{,} which includes both 6-fold and 4-fold ordered crystals{,} and kinetically arrested gels and clusters. Mixtures with fewer than 35 CAPs exhibit traveling density waves such that one end of the dense phase recedes while the other propagates.

	abstract = {Reaction-diffusion coupling (RDc) generates spatiotemporal patterns, including two dynamic wave modes: traveling and standing waves. Although mode selection plays a substantial role in the spatiotemporal organization of living cell molecules, the mechanism for selecting each wave mode remains elusive. Here, we investigated a wave mode selection mechanism using Min waves reconstituted in artificial cells, emerged by the RDc of MinD and MinE. Our experiments and theoretical analysis revealed that the balance of membrane binding and dissociation from the membrane of MinD determines the mode selection of the Min wave. We successfully demonstrated that the transition of the wave modes can be regulated by controlling this balance and found hysteresis characteristics in the wave mode transition. These findings highlight a previously unidentified role of the balance between activators and inhibitors as a determinant of the mode selection of waves by RDc and depict an unexplored mechanism in intracellular spatiotemporal pattern formations. Activator-inhibitor balance determines whether a nonlinear wave in live cells becomes a traveling wave or standing wave.}}

Although previous studies have shown that space sizes and boundaries modulate the shape and speed of Min waves, their effects on wave emergence were still elusive. Here, by using a microsized fully confined space to mimic live cells, we revealed that confinement changes the conditions for the emergence of Min waves. In the microsized space, an increased surface-to-volume ratio changed the localization efficiency of proteins on membranes, and therefore, suppression of the localization change was necessary for the stable generation of Min waves. Furthermore, we showed that the cell-sized space strictly limits parameters for wave emergence because confinement inhibits both the instability and excitability of the system. These results show that confinement of reaction-diffusion systems has the potential to control spatiotemporal patterns in live cells.},

	abstract = {Equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems exhibit power-law singularities close to their critical and bifurcation points respectively. A recent study has shown that biochemical nonequilibrium models with positive feedback belong to the universality class of the mean-field Ising model. Through a mapping between the two systems, effective thermodynamic quantities like temperature, magnetic field and order parameter can be expressed in terms of biochemical parameters. In this paper, we demonstrate the equivalence using a simple deterministic approach. As an illustration we consider a model of population dynamics exhibiting the Allee effect for which we determine the exact phase diagram. We further consider a two-variable model of positive feedback, the genetic toggle, and discuss the conditions under which the model belongs to the mean-field Ising universality class. In the biochemical models, the supercritical pitchfork bifurcation point serves as the critical point. The dynamical behaviour predicted by the two models is in qualitative agreement with experimental observations and opens up the possibility of exploring critical point phenomena in laboratory populations and synthetic biological circuits.}

	journal = {J. Phys. Condens.},
	abstract = {The past two decades have seen a remarkable progress in the development of synthetic colloidal agents which are capable of creating directed motion in an unbiased environment at the microscale. These self-propelling particles are often praised for their enormous potential to self-organize into dynamic nonequilibrium structures such as living clusters, synchronized super-rotor structures or self-propelling molecules featuring a complexity which is rarely found outside of the living world. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the formation and dynamics of many of these structures are still barely understood, which is likely to hinge on the gaps in our understanding of how active colloids interact. In particular, besides showing comparatively short-ranged interactions which are well known from passive colloids (Van der Waals, electrostatic etc), active colloids show novel hydrodynamic interactions as well as phoretic and substrate-mediated ‘osmotic’ cross-interactions which hinge on the action of the phoretic field gradients which are induced by the colloids on other colloids in the system. The present article discusses the complexity and the intriguing properties of these interactions which in general are long-ranged, non-instantaneous, non-pairwise and non-reciprocal and which may serve as key ingredients for the design of future nonequilibrium colloidal materials. Besides providing a brief overview on the state of the art of our understanding of these interactions a key aim of this review is to emphasize open key questions and corresponding open challenges.}

	abstract = {We study a non-equilibrium Langevin many-body system containing two ‘test’ particles and many ‘background’ particles. The test particles are spatially confined by a harmonic potential, and the background particles are driven by an external driving force. Using numerical simulations of the model, we formulate an effective description of the two test particles in a non-equilibrium steady state. In particular, we investigate several different definitions of the effective force acting between the test particles. We find that the law of action and reaction does not hold for the total mechanical force exerted by the background particles, but that it does hold for the thermodynamic force defined operationally on the basis of an idea used to extend the first law of thermodynamics to non-equilibrium steady states.}

When the continuous part of the group O(2) is weakly broken, the corresponding instability may lead to nonsymmetric but steady states. The transition from this state to the travelling wave state with increasing bifurcation parameter is complex, and typically involves sequences of global bifurcations. The possible scenarios are described in detail and the results are related to the dynamics associated with parity-breaking instabilities of spatially periodic patterns in inhomogeneous systems.}

Through the linear stability analysis of local equilibrium we obtain the condition how the Turing bifurcation, Hopf bifurcation and the oscillatory instability boundaries arise. By using the method of the weak nonlinear multiple scales analysis and Taylor series expansion, we derive the amplitude equations of the stationary patterns. The analysis of amplitude equations shows the occurrence of different complex phenomena, including Turing instability Eckhaus instability and zigzag instability. In addition, we apply this analysis to FitzHugh–Nagumo model and find that this model has very rich dynamical behaviors, such as spotted, stripe and hexagon patterns. Finally, the numerical simulation shows that the analytical results agree with numerical simulation.}

Despite this restriction{,} we observe a wealth of phenomena including formation of two types of vortices{,} phase separation{,} and flocking transitions. To understand the appearance and disappearance of vortices in the many-particle system{,} we further investigate the dynamics of simple ring structures under the impact of self-propulsion."}

	abstract = { The versal deformation of a vector field of co-dimension two that is equivariant under a representation of the symmetry group O(2 ) and has a nilpotent linearization at the origin is studied. An appropriate scaling allows us to formulate the problem in terms of a central-force problem with a small dissipative perturbation. We derive and analyse averaged equations for the angular momentum and the energy of the classical motion. The unfolded system possesses four different types of non-trivial solutions: a steady-state and three others, which are referred to in a wave context as travelling waves, standing waves and modulated waves. The plane of unfolding parameters is divided into a number of regions by (approximately) straight lines corresponding to primary and secondary bifurcations. Crossing one of these lines leads to the appearance or disappearance of a particular solution. We locate secondary saddlenode, Hops and pitchfork bifurcations as well as three different global, i.e. homoclinic and heteroclinic, bifurcations. }

We present basic concepts of irreversible thermodynamics of spatially extended multicomponent active systems. Starting from the rate of entropy production, we identify conjugate thermodynamic fluxes and forces and present generic constitutive equations of polar active fluids and active gels. We also discuss angular momentum conservation which plays a role in the the physics of active chiral gels. The irreversible thermodynamics of active gels provides a general framework to discuss the physics that underlies a wide variety of biological processes in cells and in multicellular tissues.}

	abstract  ="Cell crawling crucially depends on the collective dynamics of the acto-myosin cytoskeleton. However{,} it remains an open question to what extent cell polarization and persistent motion depend on continuous regulatory mechanisms and autonomous physical mechanisms. Experiments on cell fragments and theoretical considerations for active polar liquids have highlighted that physical mechanisms induce motility through splay and bend configurations in a nematic director field. Here{,} we employ a simple model{,} derived from basic thermodynamic principles{,} for active polar free-surface droplets to identify a different mechanism of motility. Namely{,} active stresses drive drop motion through spatial variations of polarization strength. This robustly induces parity-symmetry breaking and motility even for liquid ridges (2D drops) and adds to splay- and bend-driven pumping in 3D geometries. Intriguingly{,} then{,} stable polar moving and axisymmetric resting states may coexist{,} reminiscent of the interconversion of moving and resting keratocytes by external stimuli. The identified additional motility mode originates from a competition between the elastic bulk energy and the polarity control exerted by the drop surface. As it already breaks parity-symmetry for passive drops{,} the resulting back-forth asymmetry enables active stresses to effectively pump liquid and drop motion ensues."}

	title = {Physics of active emulsions},
	journal = {Rep. Prog. Phys.},
	abstract = {Phase separating systems that are maintained away from thermodynamic equilibrium via molecular processes represent a class of active systems, which we call active emulsions. These systems are driven by external energy input, for example provided by an external fuel reservoir. The external energy input gives rise to novel phenomena that are not present in passive systems. For instance, concentration gradients can spatially organise emulsions and cause novel droplet size distributions. Another example are active droplets that are subject to chemical reactions such that their nucleation and size can be controlled, and they can divide spontaneously. In this review, we discuss the physics of phase separation and emulsions and show how the concepts that govern such phenomena can be extended to capture the physics of active emulsions. This physics is relevant to the spatial organisation of the biochemistry in living cells, for the development of novel applications in chemical engineering and models for the origin of life.}

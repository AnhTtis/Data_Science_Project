    "abstract": "We study fluctuating field models with spontaneously emerging dynamical phases. We consider two typical transition scenarios associated with parity-time symmetry breaking: oscillatory instabilities and critical exceptional points. An analytical investigation of the low-noise limit reveals an unbounded increase of the mesoscopic entropy production rate toward the transitions. For an illustrative model of two nonreciprocally coupled Cahn-Hilliard fields, we find physical interpretations in terms of actively propelled interfaces and a coupling of modes near the critical exceptional point.",

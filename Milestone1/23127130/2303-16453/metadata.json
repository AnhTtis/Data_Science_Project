    "abstract": "Fast neutrino flavor conversions (FFCs) and collisional flavor instabilities (CFIs) potentially affect the dynamics of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and binary neutron star mergers (BNSMs). Under the assumption of homogeneous neutrinos, we investigate effects of neutrino emission and absorption (EA) by matters through both single and multi-energy numerical simulations with physically motivated setup. In our models, FFCs dominate over CFIs in the early phase, while EA secularly and significantly give impacts on flavor conversions. They facilitate angular swaps, or the full exchange between electron neutrinos ($ν_e$) and heavy-leptonic neutrinos ($ν_x$). As a result, the number density of $ν_x$ becomes more abundant than the case without EA, despite the fact that the isotropization by EA terminates the FFCs earlier. In the later phase, the system approaches new asymptotic states characterized by EA and CFIs, in which rich energy-dependent structures also emerge. Multi-energy effects sustain FFCs and the time evolution of the flavor conversion becomes energy dependent, which are essentially in line with effects of the isoenergetic scattering studied in our previous paper. We also find that $ν_x$ in the high-energy region convert into $ν_e$ via flavor conversions and then they are absorbed through charged current reactions, exhibiting the possibility of new path of heating matters.",

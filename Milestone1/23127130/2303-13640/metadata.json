    "abstract": "Dusty plasmas are known to support a diverse range of instabilities, including both generalizations of standard plasma instabilities and ones caused by effects specific to dusty systems. It has been recently demonstrated that a novel broad class of streaming instabilities, termed resonant drag instabilities (RDIs), can be attributed to a particular resonance phenomenon caused by defective eigenvalues of the linearized dust/fluid system. In this work, it is demonstrated that this resonance phenomenon is not unique to RDIs and can be used as a framework to understand a wider range of instabilities, termed resonant instabilities. Particular attention is given to the filamentary ionization instability seen in laboratory dusty plasmas and to the two-stream instability. It is shown that, due to the commonalities in underlying physics between the dust-ion-acoustic two-stream instability and the acoustic RDI, these instabilities should be relevant in strongly overlapping regimes in astrophysical dusty plasmas. It is proposed that a similar overlap in the experimental accessibility of these modes (and of the filamentary instability) allows for the possibility of experimental investigation of complex and astrophysically relevant instability dynamics.",

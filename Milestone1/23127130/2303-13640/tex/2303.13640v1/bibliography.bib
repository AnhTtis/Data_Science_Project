  abstract = {New abundance tables have been compiled for Cl chondrites and the solar photosphere and corona, based on a critical review of the literature to mid-1988. The meteorite data are generally accurate to {$\pm$} 5\textendash 10\%. Significant discrepancies between Sun and meteorites occur only for Fe, Mn, Ge, Pb, and W; other well-determined elements agree to {$\pm$}9\% on the average. There is no evidence for group fractionations in Cl chondrites of cosmochemically similar elements (refractories, siderophiles, volatiles, etc.), but a selective fractionation of Fe cannot be ruled out. Abundances of odd-A nuclides between A = 65 and 209 show a generally smooth trend, with elemental abundances conforming to the slope defined by isotopic abundances. Significant irregularities occur in the NdSmEu region, however, suggesting that the abundance curve is dependably smooth only down to the {$\sim$}20\% level.},

An additional feature of this presentation is that matrix notation and methods are used throughout. In particular, we formulate the equations for each term of the analytic expansions of eigenvalues and eigenvectors as \{\textbackslash em matrix equations\}, namely Sylvester equations in particular. Solvability conditions and explicit expressions for solutions of such matrix equations are given, and expressions for each term in the analytic expansions are given in terms of those solutions. This unified treatment simplifies somewhat the complex notation that is commonly seen in the literature, and in particular, provides relatively compact expressions for the non-Hermitian and degenerate cases, as well as for higher order terms.},

  abstract = {The Hamiltonian H specifies the energy levels and time evolution of a quantum theory. A standard axiom of quantum mechanics requires that H be Hermitian because Hermiticity guarantees that the energy spectrum is real and that time evolution is unitary (probability-preserving). This paper describes an alternative formulation of quantum mechanics in which the mathematical axiom of Hermiticity (transpose +complex conjugate) is replaced by the physically transparent condition of space\textendash time reflection ( ) symmetry. If H has an unbroken symmetry, then the spectrum is real. Examples of -symmetric non-Hermitian quantum-mechanical Hamiltonians are and . Amazingly, the energy levels of these Hamiltonians are all real and positive! Does a -symmetric Hamiltonian H specify a physical quantum theory in which the norms of states are positive and time evolution is unitary? The answer is that if H has an unbroken symmetry, then it has another symmetry represented by a linear operator . In terms of , one can construct a time-independent inner product with a positive-definite norm. Thus, -symmetric Hamiltonians describe a new class of complex quantum theories having positive probabilities and unitary time evolution. The Lee model provides an excellent example of a -symmetric Hamiltonian. The renormalized Lee-model Hamiltonian has a negative-norm `ghost' state because renormalization causes the Hamiltonian to become non-Hermitian. For the past 50 years there have been many attempts to find a physical interpretation for the ghost, but all such attempts failed. The correct interpretation of the ghost is simply that the non-Hermitian Lee-model Hamiltonian is -symmetric. The operator for the Lee model is calculated exactly and in closed form and the ghost is shown to be a physical state having a positive norm. The ideas of symmetry are illustrated by using many quantum-mechanical and quantum-field-theoretic models.},

Current models of the size- and radial evolution of dust in protoplanetary disks generally oversimplify either the radial evolution of the disk (by focussing at one single radius or by using steady state disk models) or they assume particle growth to proceed monodispersely or without fragmentation. Further studies of protoplanetary disks - such as observations, disk chemistry and structure calculations or planet population synthesis models - depend on the distribution of dust as a function of grain size and radial position in the disk. Aims. We attempt to improve upon current models to be able to investigate how the initial conditions, the build-up phase, and the evolution of the protoplanetary disk influence growth and transport of dust. Methods. We introduce a new version of the model of Brauer et al. (2008) in which we now include the time-dependent viscous evolution of the gas disk, and in which more advanced input physics and numerical integration methods are implemented. Results. We show that grain properties, the gas pressure gradient, and the amount of turbulence are much more influencing the evolution of dust than the initial conditions or the build-up phase of the protoplanetary disk. We quantify which conditions or environments are favorable for growth beyond the meter size barrier. High gas surface densities or zonal flows may help to overcome the problem of radial drift, however already a small amount of turbulence poses a much stronger obstacle for grain growth.},

First, the mean scalar dissipation rate {$\langle\chi\rangle$}=2D{$\langle$}|{$\nabla\theta$}|2{$\rangle$}, when suitably nondimensionalized, decreases as 1/logSc. Second, 1D cuts through the scalar field indicate increasing density of sharp fronts on larger scales, oscillating with large excursions leading to reduced mixing, and additionally suggesting weakening of scalar variance flux across the scales. The scaling exponents of the scalar structure functions in the inertial-convective range appear to saturate with respect to the moment order and the saturation exponent approaches unity as Sc increases, qualitatively consistent with 1D cuts of the scalar.},

The model is based on the two-equation ({$\kappa$}-{$\epsilon$}) turbulence model developed for calculating the analogous gas-phase flows. Contrary to passive additives in a single phase flow, the particles will affect the turbulence structure of the continuous phase. Thus, the {$\kappa$}-{$\epsilon$} model has been modified to account for the presence of the dispersed particles. In particular, the particles increase the dissipation rate because of the relative velocity fluctuations between the two phases. New proposals for these added effects based on particle size and loading are added to these equations. The resulting model is used to compute the axisymmetric jet in its developing region. The calculated jet spreading rate, centre-line velocity decay and entrainment rate are all in excellent agreement with published experimental data. Calculated turbulence quantities such as the kinetic energy and mean Reynolds shear stress are greatly reduced from their ``clean jet'' levels by the presence of the particles in good agreement with the available experimental data.},

We review the possibility that planetesimals form when self-gravity brings together vast ensembles of small particles. Even when self-gravity is weak, aerodynamic processes can accumulate solids relative to gas, paving the way for gravitational collapse. Particles pile up as they drift radially inward. Gas turbulence stirs particles but can also seed collapse by clumping them. Whereas the feedback of solids on gas triggers vertical-shear instabilities that obstruct self-gravity, this same feedback triggers streaming instabilities that strongly concentrate particles. Numerical simulations find that solids {$\sim$}10\textendash 100~cm in size gravitationally collapse in turbulent disks.

Observable propagation effects are explored using a one-dimensional thin-screen model for the turbulent medium. Diffraction caused by stochastic small-scale irregularities is combined with refraction from deterministic large-scale irregularities. Some of the effects are illustrated with numerical simulations of the wave propagation. Multiple imaging is considered, delineating the possible effects and discussing their extensions to two-dimensional screens and extended three-dimensional media. The case where refraction as well as diffraction is caused by a stochastic medium with a spectrum of a given form is considered. The magnitudes of observable effects is estimated for representative spectra that may be relevant to the ISM. The importance of the various effects for timing and scintillation observations of pulsars, VLBI observations of galactic and extragalactic radio sources, and for variability measurements of extragalactic sources is assessed.},

Air turbulence is thought to be the main cause for collisions of similar-sized droplets exceeding radii of a few micrometres, and therefore rain prediction requires a quantitative description of droplet collision in turbulence1,2,3,4,5. Turbulent vortices act as small centrifuges that spin heavy droplets out, creating concentration inhomogeneities6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14 and jets of droplets, both of which increase the mean collision rate. Here we derive a formula for the collision rate of small heavy particles in a turbulent flow, using a recently developed formalism for tracing random trajectories15,16. We describe an enhancement of inertial effects by turbulence intermittency and an interplay between turbulence and gravity that determines the collision rate. We present a new mechanism, the `sling effect', for collisions due to jets of droplets that become detached from the air flow. We conclude that air turbulence can substantially accelerate the appearance of large droplets that trigger rain.},

The extent of the magnetically uncoupled (`dead') zone depends sensitively on {$\alpha$}, on the assumed accretion rate and on the critical magnetic Reynolds number, below which magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence cannot be self-sustained. Its extent is extremely model-dependent. It is also shown that a tiny fraction of the cosmic abundance of metal atoms can dramatically affect the ionization balance. Gravitational instabilities are an unpromising source of transport, except in the early stages of disc formation.},

  abstract = {We present the two-dimensional ionization structure of self-similar magnetohydrodynamic winds off accretion disks around and irradiated by a central X-ray point source. On the basis of earlier observational clues and theoretical arguments, we focus our attention on a subset of these winds, namely those with radial density dependence n(r) {$\propto$} 1/r (r is the spherical radial coordinate). We employ the photoionization code XSTAR to compute the ionic abundances of a large number of ions of different elements and then compile their line-of-sight (LOS) absorption columns. We focus our attention on the distribution of the column density of the various ions as a function of the ionization parameter {$\xi$} (or equivalently r) and the angle \texttheta. Particular attention is paid to the absorption measure distribution (AMD), namely their hydrogen-equivalent column per logarithmic {$\xi$} interval, dNH/dlog {$\xi$}, which provides a measure of the winds' radial density profiles. For the chosen density profile n(r) {$\propto$} 1/r, the AMD is found to be independent of {$\xi$}, in good agreement with its behavior inferred from the X-ray spectra of several active galactic nuclei (AGNs). For the specific wind structure and X-ray spectrum, we also compute detailed absorption line profiles for a number of ions to obtain their LOS velocities, v {$\sim$} 100\textendash 300 km s-1 (at log {$\xi$} {$\sim$} 2\textendash 3) for Fe xvii and v {$\sim$} 1000\textendash 4000 km s-1 (at log {$\xi$} {$\sim$} 4\textendash 5) for Fe xxv, in good agreement with the observation. Our models describe the X-ray absorption properties of these winds with only two parameters, namely the mass-accretion rate and the LOS angle \texttheta. The probability of obscuration of the X-ray ionizing source in these winds decreases with increasing and increases steeply with the LOS inclination angle \texttheta. As such, we concur with previous authors that these wind configurations, viewed globally, incorporate all the requisite properties of the parsec scale ``torii'' invoked in AGN unification schemes. We indicate that a combination of the AMD and absorption line profile observations can uniquely determine these model parameters and their bearing on AGN population demographics.},

This occurs under conditions relevant to both plasma processing discharges and plasma crystal experiments. The void results from a balance of the electrostatic and ion drag forces on a dust particle. The ion drag force is driven by a flow of ions outward from an ionization source and toward the surrounding dust cloud, which has a negative space charge. In equilibrium the force balance for dust particles requires that the boundary with the dust cloud be sharp, provided that the particles are cold and monodispersive. Numerical solutions of the one-dimensional nonlinear fluid equations are carried out including dust charging and dust-neutral collisions, but not ion-neutral collisions. The regions of parameter space that allow stable void equilibria are identified. There is a minimum ionization rate that can sustain a void. Spatial profiles of plasma parameters in the void are reported. In the absence of ion-neutral collisions, the ion flow enters the dust cloud's edge at Mach number M=1. Phase diagrams for expanding or contracting voids reveal a stationary point corresponding to a single stable equilibrium void size, provided the ionization rate is constant. Large voids contract and small voids expand until they attain this stationary void size. On the other hand, if the ionization rate is not constant, the void size can oscillate. Results are compared to recent laboratory and microgravity experiments.},

It is known that the flow of a simple, newtonian fluid is likely to be turbulent when the Reynolds number is large (typically when the velocity is high, the viscosity is low and the size of the tank is large1,2). In contrast, viscoelastic fluids3 such as solutions of flexible long-chain polymers have nonlinear mechanical properties and therefore may be expected to behave differently. Here we observe experimentally that the flow of a sufficiently elastic polymer solution can become irregular even at low velocity, high viscosity and in a small tank. The fluid motion is excited in a broad range of spatial and temporal scales, and we observe an increase in the flow resistance by a factor of about twenty. Although the Reynolds number may be arbitrarily low, the observed flow has all the main features of developed turbulence. A comparable state of turbulent flow for a newtonian fluid in a pipe would have a Reynolds number as high as 105 (refs 1, 2). The low Reynolds number or `elastic' turbulence that we observe is accompanied by significant stretching of the polymer molecules, resulting in an increase in the elastic stresses of up to two orders of magnitude.},

  abstract = {The features of turbulence modulation produced by a heavy-loaded suspension of small solid particles or liquid droplets are discussed by using a physically based regularization of particle-fluid interactions. The approach allows a robust description of the small-scale properties of the system exploiting the convergence of the statistics with respect to the regularization parameter. It is shown that sub-Kolmogorov particles or droplets modify the energy spectrum, leading to a scaling law, E(k){$\propto$}k-4, that emerges at small scales where the particle forcing balances the viscous dissipation. This regime is confirmed by direct numerical simulation data of a particle-laden statistically steady homogeneous shear flow, demonstrating the ability of the regularized model to capture the relevant small-scale physics. The energy budget in spectral space, extended to account for the interphase momentum exchange, highlights how the particle provides an energy sink in the production range that turns into a source at small scales. Overall, the dissipative fluid-particle interaction is found to stall the energy cascade processes typical of Newtonian turbulent flows. In terms of particle statistics, clustering at small scale is depleted, with potential consequences for collision models.},

A very strong electric field with very weak or no thermal fluctuations may force ER fluids into a polycrystalline structure. When both the electric field and thermal fluctuation are strong, ER fluids develop into a glasslike state, in which the particles aggregate together to form thick columns, but the structure has no appreciable ordering. The simulation has also shown that the solidification time and chain formation time in ER fluid systems depend mainly on the ratio of the viscous force to the dipolar force.},

The discovery of wakes and the measurement of their opening angles by the space experiment Cassini to Saturn will yield added information on the dusty plasma conditions in regions through which Cassini will not pass. We find that in some regions the waves that are excited by the boulders may be weak because a large fraction of the interacting dust is absorbed rather than deflected by the boulder. For a given dust size the most favourable conditions for the observations of wakes exist in two fairly narrow regions, one inside and one outside the corotation radius. The favorable regions are closest to the corotation radius for the smallest dust particles and progressively further away for larger dust particles.},

While molecular lines show the presence of large, massive disks, the IR observations appear to be dominated by a strong polar component that has been interpreted as a dusty wind. This paper aims at using characteristics shared by AGNs in each of the wavebands and a set of simple physical principles to form a unifying view of these seemingly contradictory observations: dusty molecular gas flows in from galactic scales of {$\sim$}100 pc to the subparsec environment via a disk with small to moderate scale height. The hot, inner part of the disk puffs up due to IR radiation pressure and unbinds a large amount of the inflowing gas from the black hole's gravitational potential, providing the conditions to launch a wind driven by the radiation pressure from the AGN. The dusty wind feeds back mass into the galaxy at a rate of the order of {$\sim$}0.1\textendash 100 M{$\odot$} yr-1, depending on the AGN luminosity and Eddington ratio. Angle-dependent obscuration as required by AGN unification is provided by a combination of disk, wind, and wind-launching region.},

  abstract = {Radiation-dust driven outflows, where radiation pressure on dust grains accelerates gas, occur in many astrophysical environments. Almost all previous numerical studies of these systems have assumed that the dust was perfectly-coupled to the gas. However, it has recently been shown that the dust in these systems is unstable to a large class of 'resonant drag instabilities' (RDIs) which de-couple the dust and gas dynamics and could qualitatively change the nonlinear outcome of these outflows. We present the first simulations of radiation-dust driven outflows in stratified, inhomogeneous media, including explicit grain dynamics and a realistic spectrum of grain sizes and charge, magnetic fields and Lorentz forces on grains (which dramatically enhance the RDIs), Coulomb and Epstein drag forces, and explicit radiation transport allowing for different grain absorption and scattering properties. In this paper we consider conditions resembling giant molecular clouds (GMCs), HII regions, and distributed starbursts, where optical depths are modest (\$\textbackslash lesssim 1\$), single-scattering effects dominate radiation-dust coupling, Lorentz forces dominate over drag on grains, and the fastest-growing RDIs are similar, such as magnetosonic and fast-gyro RDIs. These RDIs generically produce strong size-dependent dust clustering, growing nonlinear on timescales that are much shorter than the characteristic times of the outflow. The instabilities produce filamentary and plume-like or 'horsehead' nebular morphologies that are remarkably similar to observed dust structures in GMCs and HII regions. Additionally, in some cases they strongly alter the magnetic field structure and topology relative to filaments. Despite driving strong micro-scale dust clumping which leaves some gas 'behind,' an order-unity fraction of the gas is always efficiently entrained by dust.},

These can drive large dust-to-gas ratio fluctuations even at arbitrarily small dust-to-gas mass ratios. Here, we identify and study both resonant and new non-resonant instabilities, in the simple case where the gas satisfies neutral hydrodynamics and supports acoustic waves (\$\textbackslash omega\^\{2\}=c\_\{s\}\^\{2\}\textbackslash,k\^\{2\}\$). The gas and dust are coupled via an arbitrary drag law and subject to external accelerations (e.g. gravity, radiation pressure). If there is any dust drift velocity, the system is unstable. The instabilities exist for \{\textbackslash em all\} dust-to-gas ratios \$\textbackslash mu\$ and their growth rates depend only weakly on \$\textbackslash mu\$ around resonance, as \$\textbackslash sim\textbackslash mu\^\{1/3\}\$ or \$\textbackslash sim \textbackslash mu\^\{1/2\}\$ (depending on wavenumber). The behavior changes depending on whether the drift velocity is larger or smaller than the sound speed \$c\_\{s\}\$. In the supersonic regime a 'resonant' instability appears with growth rate increasing without limit with wavenumber, even for vanishingly small \$\textbackslash mu\$ and values of the coupling strength ('stopping time'). In the subsonic regime non-resonant instabilities always exist, but their growth rates no longer increase indefinitely towards small wavelengths. The dimensional scalings and qualitative behavior of the instability do not depend sensitively on the drag law or equation-of-state of the gas. The instabilities directly drive exponentially growing dust-to-gas-ratio fluctuations, which can be large even when the modes are otherwise weak. We discuss physical implications for cool-star winds, AGN-driven winds and torii, and starburst winds: the instabilities alter the character of these outflows and could drive clumping and/or turbulence in the dust and gas.},

But the role of magnetic fields and charged dust has not yet been studied. We therefore explore the RDI in gas that obeys ideal MHD and is coupled to dust via both Lorentz forces and drag, with an external acceleration (e.g. gravity, radiation) driving dust drift through gas. We show this is always unstable, at all wavelengths and non-zero values of dust-to-gas ratio, drift velocity, dust charge, `stopping time' or drag coefficient (for any drag law), or field strength; moreover, growth rates depend only weakly (sub-linearly) on these parameters. Dust charge and magnetic fields do not suppress instabilities, but give rise to a large number of new instability `families,' each with distinct behavior. The `MHD-wave' (magnetosonic or Alfv\'en) RDIs exhibit maximal growth along `resonant' angles where the modes have a phase velocity matching the corresponding MHD wave, and growth rates increase without limit with wavenumber. The `gyro' RDIs are driven by resonances between drift and Larmor frequencies, giving growth rates sharply peaked at specific wavelengths. Other instabilities include `acoustic' and `pressure-free' modes (previously studied), and a family akin to cosmic ray instabilities that appear when Lorentz forces are strong and dust streams super-Alfv\'enically along field lines. We discuss astrophysical applications in the warm ISM, circum-galactic medium/inter-galactic medium (CGM/IGM), H ii regions, SNe ejecta/remnants, Solar corona, cool-star winds, GMCs, and AGN.},

We show that the CR-induced photoemission can dramatically modify the charge distribution function for submicron grains. We demonstrate the importance of the obtained results for dust coagulation: While the charging by ambient plasma alone leads to a strong Coulomb repulsion between grains and inhibits their further coagulation, the combination with the photoemission provides optimum conditions for the growth of large dust aggregates in a certain region of the cloud, corresponding to the densities \$n(\textbackslash mathrm\{H\_2\})\$ between \$\textbackslash sim10\^4\$ cm\$\^\{-3\}\$ and \$\textbackslash sim10\^6\$ cm\$\^\{-3\}\$.

We determine a critical gas density above which the recombination of electrons and ions on the grain surface dominates over the gas-phase recombination. For this regime, we present a self-consistent analytical model, which allows us to calculate exactly the abundances of charged species in dusty gas, without making assumptions on the grain charge distribution. To demonstrate the importance of the proposed approach, we check whether the conventional approximation of low grain charges is valid for typical protoplanetary disks, and discuss the implications for dust coagulation and development of the ``dead zone'' in the disk. The presented model is applicable for arbitrary grain-size distributions and, for given dust properties and conditions of the disk, has only one free parameter\textemdash the effective mass of the ions, shown to have a small effect on the results. The model can be easily included in numerical simulations following the dust evolution in dense molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks.},

By measuring scalar increment moments of high orders, while ensuring statistical convergence, we provide unambiguous evidence that the scaling exponents saturate to 1.2 for moment orders beyond about 12, indicating that scalar intermittency is dominated by the most singular shocklike cliffs in the scalar field. We show that the fractal dimension of the spatial support of steep cliffs is about 1.8, whose sum with the saturation exponent value of 1.2 adds up to the space dimension of 3, thus demonstrating a deep connection between the geometry and statistics in turbulent scalar mixing. The anomaly for the fourth and sixth order moments is comparable to that in the Kraichnan model for the roughness exponent of 4/3.},

What is less known is that the first complete explanation of Ziegler's paradox by means of the Whitney umbrella singularity dates back to 1956. We revisit this undeservedly forgotten pioneering result by Oene Bottema that outstripped later findings for about half a century.

  abstract = {Centrifugally driven winds from the surfaces of magnetized accretion disks have been recognized as an attractive mechanism of removing the angular momentum of the accreted matter and of producing the bipolar outflows and jets that are often associated with compact astronomical objects. As previously suggested in the context of young stellar objects, such winds have unique observational manifestations stemming from their highly stratified density and velocity structure and from their exposure to the strong continuum radiation field of the compact object. We have applied this scenario to active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and investigated the properties of hydromagnetic outflows that originate within approximately 10(M(sub 8)) pc of the central 10(exp 8)(M(sub 8)) solar mass black hole. On the basis of our results, we propose that hydromagnetic disk-driven winds may underlie the classification of broad-line and narrow-line AGNs (e.g., the Seyfert 1/Seyfert 2 dichotomy) as well as the apparent dearth of luminous Seyfert 2 galaxies. More generally, we demonstrate that such winds could strongly influence the spectral characteristics of Seyfert galaxies, QSOs, and BL Lac objects (BLOs). In our picture, the torus is identified with the outer regions of the wind where dust uplifted from the disk surfaces by gas-grain collisions is embedded in the outflow. Using an efficient radiative transfer code, we show that the infrared emission of Seyfert galaxies and QSOs can be attributed to the reprocessing of the UV/soft X-ray AGN continuum by the dust in the wind and the disk. We demonstrate that the radiation pressure force flattens the dust distribution in objects with comparatively high (but possibly sub-Eddington) bolometric luminosities, and we propose this as one likely reason for the apparent paucity of narrow-line objects among certain high-luminosity AGNs. Using the XSTAR photoionization code, we show that the inner regions of the wind could naturally account for the warm (greater than or approximately equal to 10(exp 5) K) and hot (greater than or approximately equal to 10(exp 6) K) gas components that have been inferred to exist on scales less than or approximately equal to 10(exp 2) pc in several Seyfert galaxies. We suggest that the partially ionized gas in the inner regions of the wind, rather than the dusty, neutral outflow that originates further out in the disk, could account for the bulk of the X-ray absorption in Seyferts observed at relatively small angles to their symmetry axes. Finally, we discuss the application of this model to the interpretation of the approximately 0.6 keV X-ray absorption feature reported in several BLOs.},

  abstract = {The interaction between galactic cosmic rays and Alfv\'en waves in the interstellar medium is investigated. They may interact adiabatically through magnetic mirror scattering or non-adiabatically through gyration frequency resonance. The equations describing the latter are derived. The growth rates for the waves are given, and the Fokker-Planck equation for the diffusion of cosmic rays in velocity space is derived. These two equations are applied to a model of the cosmic rays consisting of a uniform tube of magnetic field with open ends. An equation of spatial diffusion is derived in the limit of strong waveparticle scattering, and this equation is compared with the observed properties of the galactic cosmic rays to derive a mean free path for scattering of about 10 pc. It is shown that when the interstellar damping of the Alfv\'en waves is included, the waves are probably marginally stable. Finally, a selfconsistent model is specified in which the sources of turbulence and cosmic rays are given and the cosmicray densities are to be determined. This model is solved in the crude approximation where all particles have effectively the same energy and all waves the same wavelength. It is shown that the cosmic rays can have an appreciable effect on their confinement to the Galaxy. It is shown that if the inhomogeneous distribution of mass is taken into account, the confinement of cosmic rays is determined primarily by the low-density regions between the clouds. An attempt is made to evaluate the efficiency of heating of cosmic rays, and it appears that their energy changes very little during their galactic confinement. However, because there is a non-linear relation between the source and the cosmic-ray density, the observed energy spectrum does not necessarily represent the emitted spectrum.},

This near conservation of the dust-to-gas ratio along streamlines is analogous to the near conservation of entropy along flows of (dust-free) gas with weak heating and cooling. We develop this thermodynamic analogy into a framework to study dusty gas dynamics in protoplanetary disks. We show that an isothermal dusty gas behaves like an adiabatic pure gas, and that finite dust\textendash gas coupling may be regarded as effective heating/cooling. We exploit this correspondence to deduce that (1) perfectly coupled, thin dust layers cannot cause axisymmetric instabilities; (2) radial dust edges are unstable if the dust is vertically well-mixed; (3) the streaming instability necessarily involves a gas pressure response that lags behind dust density; and (4) dust-loading introduces buoyancy forces that generally stabilize the vertical shear instability associated with global radial temperature gradients. We also discuss dusty analogs of other hydrodynamic processes (e.g., Rossby wave instability, convective overstability, and zombie vortices) and how to simulate dusty protoplanetary disks with minor tweaks to existing codes for pure gas dynamics.},

The problem is overcome by starting the perturbation expansion from an exactly defective (tuned) system "close" to the mistuned one. Asymptotic expansions are then obtained in terms of fractional powers of two parameters: the modification and the mistuning parameter. However, as the tuned system is unknown, an inverse problem has to be solved in order to determine it. An algorithm valid for the particular but frequent case of several couples of nearly coincident eigenvalues has been detailed for this problem; an outline of a more general case is also given.

Poisson's equation, with appropriate electron and ion number densities, is then reduced to an energy integral which provides criteria for the existence of the plasma voids. The latter are characterized as regions of significant ion and electron density depletions in association with negative plasma potentials.

  abstract = {Supernova ejecta and stellar winds are believed to produce interstellar dust grains with relatively large sizes. One way to produce smaller grains is via the shattering of large grains that have been stochastically accelerated to high velocities. To understand this stochastic acceleration, we have implemented novel magnetohydrodynamic(MHD)-particle-in-cell(PIC) methods into the astrophysical fluid code RAMSES. We treat dust grains as a set of massive "superparticles" that experience aerodynamic drag and Lorentz force. We subject our code to a range of numerical tests designed to validate our method in different physical conditions, as well as to illustrate possible mechanisms by which grains can be accelerated. As a final test as well as a foundation for future work, we present the results of decaying dusty MHD turbulence simulations with grain parameters chosen to resemble 1-2 \$\textbackslash mu\$m grains in typical cold neutral medium conditions. We find that in these conditions, these grains can be effectively accelerated to well beyond their shattering velocities. This is true for both electrically charged and neutral grains. While the peak of the gas-grain relative drift velocity distribution is higher for neutral grains, the drift velocity distribution of charged grains exhibits an extended exponential tail out to much greater velocities. Even so, the shapes of the distributions are such that the extra gas-grain coupling provided by the Lorentz force offers grains relative protection from shattering.},

  abstract = {We study the non-linear evolution of the acoustic `resonant drag instability' (RDI) using numerical simulations. The acoustic RDI is excited in a dust\textendash gas mixture when dust grains stream through gas, interacting with sound waves to cause a linear instability. We study this process in a periodic box by accelerating neutral dust with an external driving force. The instability grows as predicted by linear theory, eventually breaking into turbulence and saturating. As in linear theory, the non-linear behaviour is characterized by three regimes \textendash{} high, intermediate, and low wavenumbers \textendash{} the boundary between which is determined by the dust\textendash gas coupling strength and the dust-to-gas mass ratio. The high and intermediate wavenumber regimes behave similarly to one another, with large dust-to-gas ratio fluctuations while the gas remains largely incompressible. The saturated state is highly anisotropic: dust is concentrated in filaments, jets, or plumes along the direction of acceleration, with turbulent vortex-like structures rapidly forming and dissipating in the perpendicular directions. The low-wavenumber regime exhibits large fluctuations in gas and dust density, but the dust and gas remain more strongly coupled in coherent `fronts' perpendicular to the acceleration. These behaviours are qualitatively different from those of dust `passively' driven by external hydrodynamic turbulence, with no back-reaction force from dust on to gas. The virulent nature of these instabilities has interesting implications for dust-driven winds in a variety of astrophysical systems, including around cool stars, in dusty torii around active-galactic-nuclei, and in and around giant molecular clouds.},

The earlier one-dimensional model has been extended to two and three dimensions (the latter, assuming spherical symmetry), using a more complete set of dynamical equations than was used in the earlier one-dimensional formulation. The present set of equations includes an ion continuity equation and a nonlinear ion drag operator. Qualitative features of void formation are shown to be robust with respect to different functional forms of the ion drag operator.},

But in the mid 1970s it began to be understood that when natural processes focus light, as when sunlight is reflected from the sea at sunset, the light caustics that are produced have a systematic behavior previously unrecognized.Natural Focusing and Fine Structure of Light: Caustics and Wave Dislocations provides a definitive account of how classical optics has been reconstructed in a modern way by emphasizing the hierarchy of singularities that exists in light fields. The book discusses the singularities of geometrical optics and their systematization by catastrophe theory. It explores the diffraction patterns associated with caustics that are dominated by wave dislocations, line singularities of the phase, and analogous to crystal dislocations.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Mutual sticking of dust aggregates is the first step toward planetesimal formation in protoplanetary disks. In spite that the electric charging of dust particles is well recognized in some contexts, it has been largely ignored in the current modeling of dust coagulation. In this study, we present a general analysis of the dust charge state in protoplanetary disks, and then demonstrate how the electric charging could dramatically change the currently accepted scenario of dust coagulation. First, we describe a new semianalytical method to calculate the dust charge state and gas ionization state self-consistently. This method is far more efficient than previous numerical methods, and provides a general and clear description of the charge state of a gas\textendash dust mixture. Second, we apply this analysis to compute the collisional cross section of growing aggregates taking their charging into account. As an illustrative example, we focus on early evolutionary stages where the dust has been thought to grow into fractal (D {$\sim$} 2) aggregates with a quasi-monodisperse (i.e., narrow) size distribution. We find that, for a wide range of model parameters, the fractal growth is strongly inhibited by the electric repulsion between colliding aggregates and eventually ``freezes out'' on its way to the subsequent growth stage involving collisional compression. Strong disk turbulence would help the aggregates to overcome this growth barrier, but then it would cause catastrophic collisional fragmentation in later growth stages. These facts suggest that the combination of electric repulsion and collisional fragmentation would impose a serious limitation on dust growth in protoplanetary disks. We propose a possible scenario of dust evolution after the freezeout. Finally, we point out that the fractal growth of dust aggregates tends to maintain a low ionization degree and, as a result, a large magnetorotationally stable region in the disk.},

  abstract = {Various observable quantities related to wave propagation through random media are generated by computer simulation and analyzed. The results are related to the nature of the medium and the source. The random (e.g. a turbulent) medium is represented by stochastic single and multiple phase screens. Thus the medium is characterized by the number of phase screens and their wavenumber spectra. The medium is assumed to be a plasma so that the frequency dependence is given by the plasma dispersion relation. The wave is propagated from a source plane, through the phase screens, to an observation plane by a FFT implementation of the Huygens-Fresnel integral. Ray tracings are also calculated. The observables generated by computer simulation include: dynamic spectra, intensity time series, dynamic, and instantaneous images. The dynamic spectra are analyzed to provide gain (average intensity), modulation indices, band slope of features drifting in frequency, decorrelation time and decorrelation bandwidth. The images show both speckles and multiple images and in some cases can be related to the dynamic spectra. Using many realizations, the ensemble intensity autocovariance and probability distribution functions of various observables are also calculated. Comparison of the simulations with theoretical calculations are made where possible. The variations of the observables are separated into diffractive (short-scale) and refractive (long-scale). The refractive modulation of the observables is treated theoretically and confirmed by simulations. Single phase screens with power law spectra (\$q\textbackslash sp\{-\textbackslash alpha\}\$) are treated theoretically. Distinctly different behavior is noted for shallow (\$\textbackslash alpha\$ \${$<\$$} 4.0) phase spectra and steep (\$\textbackslash alpha\$ \${$>\$$} 4.0) phase spectra both theoretically and in simulations. Simulation results and methods of analysis are applied to actual data of radio wave scintillation of pulsars due to the interstellar medium. An inaterstellar medium with a Kolmogorov spectrum of irregularities and large scale, deterministic density variations is found to be consistent with observations and results from both theory and simulations. Finally, an extended medium represented by multiple phase screens is treated. Similarities and differences between the single and multiple phase screen cases are noted. Analysis of the simulation ray and wave beam paths in the extended medium shows Kolmogorov entropy in agreement with theoretical prediction.},

It is expected that all classical conservative systems governed by Newton's law admit PT-symmetry, and the spontaneous breaking thereof is a generic mechanism for classical instabilities. Discovering the PT-symmetry of systems in fluid dynamics and plasma physics and identifying the PT-symmetry breaking responsible for instabilities enable new techniques to classical physics and enrich the physics of PT-symmetry.},

  abstract = {A theoretical framework is developed to describe the Topological Langmuir-Cyclotron Wave (TLCW), a recently identified topological surface excitation in magnetized plasmas. As a topological wave, the TLCW propagates unidirectionally without scattering in complex boundaries. The TLCW is studied theoretically as a spectral flow of the Hamiltonian Pseudo-Differential-Operator (PDO) \$\textbackslash hat\{H\}\$ for waves in an inhomogeneous plasma. The semi-classical parameter of the Weyl quantization for plasma waves is identified to be the ratio between electron gyro-radius and the inhomogeneity scale length of the system. Hermitian eigenmode bundles of the bulk Hamiltonian symbol H for plasma waves are formally defined. Because momentum space in classical continuous media is contractible in general, the topology of the eigenmode bundles over momentum space is trivial. This is in stark contrast to condensed matters. Nontrivial topology of the eigenmode bundles in classical continuous media only exists over phase space. A boundary isomorphism theorem is established to facilitate the calculation of Chern numbers of eigenmode bundles over non-contractible manifolds in phase space. It also defines a topological charge of an isolated Weyl point in phase space without adopting any connection. Using these algebraic topological techniques and an index theorem formulated by Faure, it is rigorously proven that the nontrivial topology at the Weyl point of the Langmuir wave-cyclotron wave resonance generates the TLCW as a spectral flow. It is shown that the TLCW can be faithfully modeled by a tilted Dirac cone in phase space. An analytical solution of the entire spectrum of the PDO of a generic tilted phase space Dirac cone, including its spectral flow, is given. The spectral flow index of a tilted Dirac cone is one, and its mode structure is a shifted Gaussian function.},

  abstract = {The size distributions of droplets emitted from Taylor cones operating in the cone-jet regime are measured by sampling their electrosprays into an aerodynamic size spectrometer (API's Aerosizer). The sizing scheme is not affected by the large charge on the un-neutralized droplets in the range of diameters d explored, 0.3 {$\mu$}m {$<$} d {$<$} 4 {$\mu$}m. The diameters of the droplets electrosprayed from highly conducting liquids are found to be relatively insensitive to electrostatic variables, depending for a given liquid mostly on the flow rate Q pushed through the jet. At fixed Q, the size distributions consist of one or several fairly monodisperse classes of droplets with diameters di(Q); i = 1, 2, \ldots, N(Q). Near the minimum flow rate Qmin at which the cone is stable, the spray tends to consist of ``primary'' and ``satellite'' droplets only, with N = 2. However, at larger flows, the modality of the distributions (N) increases. The largest size mode bifurcates into two branches at a critical flow rate Q1, coinciding with the onset of lateral oscillations of the jet. The diameter d1 of the largest drops scales approximately with r{${_\ast}$}=(Q{$\tau$})13, where {$\tau$} is the electrical relaxation time of the fluid. Surprisingly, all the other size classes have diameters di (i {$\neq$} l) nearly independent of flow rate, which scale as dmin = ({$\gamma\tau$}2/{$\rho$})13 ({$\gamma$}= coefficient of surface tension; {$\rho$}=liquid density). Although the jet diameter dj appears to be unaffected by viscosity, its breakup mechanism, and thus the diameters di of all the droplet classes, do depend on the viscous parameters {$\Pi\mu$} ({$\mu$} = coefficient of viscosity of the liquid). The diameters of the smaller droplets are given by functions didmin=Gi({$\Pi\mu$}) (i {$\neq$} 1), which depend steeply on {$\Pi\mu$} for values of this parameter below 0.06, but appear to level off above {$\Pi\mu$}=0.15. An inviscid asymptote, in which d1r{${_\ast}$}=F({$\eta$}), is approached also for d1 for sufficiently large values of {$\Pi\mu$} where {$\eta$}2={$\rho$}Q{$\gamma\tau$}. F is nearly constant below the bifurcation, and seems to tend to the asymptote F=0.43 {$\eta$}23 at large {$\eta$}, in qualitative agreement with the behavior of dj(Q{$\tau$})13 given by Fern\'andez de la Mora and Loscertales (J. Fluid Mech. 260, 155\textendash 184, 1994). It follows from the scaling laws found that, by varying the electrical conductivity of a given liquid, it should be possible to generate monodisperse droplets with initial diameters of the order of dmin, which may span the whole range between 100 {$\mu$}m down to a few nanometers. The flow rate must, however, be between Qmin and its value at the bifurcation, which requires that {$\eta$} {$\sim$} 1.},

The effect of the dust is described by two parameters; the concentration of dust and a relaxation time {$\tau$} which measures the rate at which the velocity of a dust particle adjusts to changes in the gas velocity and depends upon the size of the individual particles. It is shown that if the dust is fine enough for {$\tau$} to be small compared with a characteristic time scale associated with the flow, then the addition of dust destabilizes a gas flow; whereas if the dust is coarse so that {$\tau$} is relatively large, then the dust has a stabilizing action.For plane parallel flow, it is shown that the stability characteristics for a dusty gas are still determined by solutions of the Orr-Sommerfeld equation, but with the basic velocity profile replaced by a modified profile which is in general complex. A simple, although unrealistic, example is used to illustrate some features of the action of dust. It is intended to describe the solution of the modified Orr-Sommerfeld equation for plane Poiseuille flow in a later paper.},

The strong 9.7 and 18 {$\mu$}m silicate features observed in the AGN spectra, in both emission and absorption, further indicate the presence of such dusty environments. We present detailed calculations of the chemistry of silicate dust formation in AGN accretion disk winds. The winds considered herein are magnetohydrodynamic winds driven off the entire accretion disk domain that extends from the BH vicinity to the radius of BH influence, of order {$\sim$}1\textendash 100 pc depending on the mass of the resident BH. Our results indicate that these winds provide conditions conducive to the formation of significant amounts of dust, especially for objects accreting close to their Eddington limit, making AGNs a significant source of dust in the universe, especially for luminous quasars. Our models justify the importance of an r-1 density law in the winds for efficient formation and survival of dust grains. The dust production rate scales linearly with the mass of the central BH and varies as a power law of index between 2 and 2.5 with the dimensionless mass accretion rate. The resultant distribution of the dense dusty gas resembles a toroidal shape, with high column density and optical depths along the equatorial viewing angles, in agreement with the AGN unification picture.},

It is shown that the strong interaction of eigenvalues is a typical catastrophe. Simple examples that illustrate the main ideas are presented.

Odd viscosity provides a short-distance cutoff that allows us to define a bulk topological invariant on a compact momentum space. As the sign of odd viscosity changes, a topological phase transition occurs without closing the bulk gap. Instead, at the transition point, the topological invariant becomes ill defined because momentum space cannot be compactified. This mechanism is unique to continuum models and can describe fluids ranging from electronic to chiral active systems.},

We study flow modulation induced by small spherical particles heavier than the carrier fluid in the framework of an Eulerian two-way coupled model, where particles are represented by a continuum density transported by a compressible velocity field, exchanging momentum with the fluid phase. We implement the model in direct numerical simulations of the turbulent Kolmogorov flow, a simplified setting allowing for studying the momentum balance and the turbulent drag in the absence of boundaries. We show that the amplitude of the mean flow and the turbulence intensity are reduced by increasing particle mass loading with the consequent enhancement of the friction coefficient. Surprisingly, turbulence suppression is stronger for particles of smaller inertia. We understand such a result by mapping the equations for dusty flow, in the limit of vanishing inertia, to a Newtonian flow with an effective forcing reduced by the increase in fluid density due to the presence of particles. We also discuss the negative feedback produced by turbophoresis, which mitigates the effects of particles, especially with larger inertia, on the turbulent flow.},

This physics is generally applicable to dusty winds driven by radiation pressure, such as occurs around red-giant stars, star-forming regions, or active galactic nuclei. Depending on the physical size of the grains compared to the wavelength of the radiation field that drives the wind, two qualitatively different regimes emerge. In the case of grains that are larger than the radiation's wavelength \textendash{} termed the constant-drift regime \textendash{} the grain's equilibrium drift velocity through the gas is approximately independent of grain size, leading to strong correlations between differently sized grains that persist well into the saturated non-linear turbulence. For grains that are smaller than the radiation's wavelength \textendash{} termed the non-constant-drift regime \textendash{} the linear instability grows more slowly than the single-grain-size RDI and only the larger grains exhibit RDI-like behaviour in the saturated state. A detailed study of grain clumping and grain\textendash grain collisions shows that outflows in the constant-drift regime may be effective sites for grain growth through collisions, with large collision rates but low collision velocities.},

The study is based on the recognition that dust\textendash gas mixtures are generically unstable to a resonant drag instability (RDI), whenever the gas, absent dust, supports undamped linear modes. We show that the `streaming instability' is an RDI associated with epicyclic oscillations; this provides simple interpretations for its mechanisms and accurate analytic expressions for its growth rates and fastest growing wavelengths. We extend this analysis to more general dust streaming motions and other waves, including buoyancy and magnetohydrodynamic oscillations, finding various new instabilities. Most importantly, we identify the disc `settling instability,' which occurs as dust settles vertically into the mid-plane of a rotating disc. For small grains, this instability grows many orders of magnitude faster than the standard streaming instability, with a growth rate that is independent of grain size. Growth time scales for realistic dust-to-gas ratios are comparable to the disc orbital period, and the characteristic wavelengths are more than an order of magnitude larger than the streaming instability (allowing the instability to concentrate larger masses). This suggests that in the process of settling, dust will band into rings then filaments or clumps, potentially seeding dust traps, high-metallicity regions that in turn seed the streaming instability, or even overdensities that coagulate or directly collapse to planetesimals.},

  abstract = {In circumstellar disks, the size of dust particles varies from submicron to several centimeters, while planetesimals have sizes of hundreds of kilometers. Therefore, various regimes for the aerodynamic drag between solid bodies and gas can be realized in these disks, depending on the grain sizes and velocities: Epstein, Stokes, and Newton, as well as transitional regimes between them. For small bodies moving in the Epstein regime, the time required to establish the constant relative velocity between the gas and bodies can be much less than the dynamical time scale for the problem - the time for the rotation of the disk about the central body. In addition, the dust may be concentrated in individual regions of the disk, making it necessary to take into account the transfer of momentum between the dust and gas. It is shown that, for a system of equations for gas and monodisperse dust, a semi-implicit first-order approximation scheme in time in which the interphase interaction is calculated implicitly, while other forces, such as the pressure gradient and gravity are calculated explicitly, is suitable for stiff problems with intense interphase interactions and for computations of the drag in non-linear regimes. The piece-wise drag coefficient widely used in astrophysical simulations has a discontinuity at some values of the Mach and Knudsen numbers that are realized in a circumstellar disk. A continuous drag coefficient is presented, which corresponds to experimental dependences obtained for various drag regimes.},

The computations, on a 128               3               grid along with a maximum  of 262\hspace{0.6em}144  particles, incorporated both direct particle interactions via hard-sphere  collisions and  particle feedback. The `reverse' coupling  is accomplished in a manner ensuring correct  discrete energy conservation (Sundaram \& Collins 1996). A novel two-field  formalism  (Sundaram \& Collins 1994               a               ) is employed to calculate two-point  correlations and  equivalent spectral densities. An important consideration in these simulations  is the  initial state of fluid and particles. That is, the initial conditions must  be chosen so  as to allow a meaningful comparison of the different runs. Using such a  carefully  initialized set of runs, particle inertia was observed to increase both  the viscous  and drag dissipations; however, simultaneously, it also caused particle  velocities to  correlate for longer distances. The combination of effects suggests a mechanism  for  turbulence enhancement or suppression that depends on the parameter values.  Like  previous investigators, `pivoting' or crossover  of the fluid energy spectra was observed.  A possible new scaling for this phenomenon is suggested. Furthermore, investigations   of the influence of particle mass and number densities on turbulence modulation  are  also carried out.},

We design a new implicit scheme in the code RoSSBi, to overcome the short time-steps occurring for small grain sizes. We discover that the linear capture phase occurs self-similarly for all grain sizes, with an intrinsic timescale (characterizing the vortex lifetime) scaling as 1/St. After vortex dissipation, the formation of a global active dust ring is a generic outcome confirming our previous results obtained for larger grains. We propose a scenario in which, regardless of grain size, multiple pathways can lead to local dust-to-gas ratios of about unity and above on relatively short timescales, {$<$}105 yr, in the presence of a vortex, even with St = 10-3. When St {$>$} 10-2, the vortex is quickly dissipated by two-fluid instabilities, and large dust density enhancements form in the global dust ring. When St {$<$} 10-2, the vortex is resistant to destabilization. As a result, dust concentrations occur locally due to turbulence developing inside the vortex. Regardless of the Stokes number, dust-to-gas ratios in the range 1\textendash 10, a necessary condition to trigger a subsequent streaming instability, or even a direct gravitational instability of the dust clumps, appears to be an inevitable outcome. Although quantitative connections with other instabilities still need to be made, we argue that our results support a new scenario of vortex-driven planetesimal formation.},

Harsh AGN radiation makes a dust grain highly charged through photoelectric emission, and grain fission via Coulomb explosion occurs when the electrostatic tensile stress of a charge grain exceeds its tensile strength. We show that Coulomb explosion can preferentially remove both small silicate and graphite grains and successfully reproduce both flat extinction curve and the absence of 2175 \AA bump.},

The code is based on Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) technique, with a tree-based data structure allowing recursive grid refinements on a cell-by-cell basis. The N-body solver is very similar to the one developed for the ART code (Kravtsov et al. 1997), with minor differences in the exact implementation. The hydrodynamical solver is based on a second-order Godunov method, a modern shock-capturing scheme known to compute accurately the thermal history of the fluid component. The accuracy of the code is carefully estimated using various test cases, from pure gas dynamical tests to cosmological ones. The specific refinement strategy used in cosmological simulations is described, and potential spurious effects associated with shock waves propagation in the resulting AMR grid are discussed and found to be negligible. Results obtained in a large N-body and hydrodynamical simulation of structure formation in a low density {$\Lambda$}CDM universe are reported, with 2563 particles and 4.1 \texttimes{} 107 cells in the AMR grid, reaching a formal resolution of 81923. A convergence analysis of different quantities, such as dark matter density power spectrum, gas pressure power spectrum and individual haloe temperature profiles, shows that numerical results are converging down to the actual resolution limit of the code, and are well reproduced by recent analytical predictions in the framework of the halo model.},

This is a signature of elastic turbulence where Weissenberg's number also plays a role in the onset of turbulence. This has been reported in several experiments. It is also shown that the existence of memory relaxation time parameter and the transverse shear wave inhibit the normal process (for 2-D systems) of inverse spectral cascade in this case. A detailed simulation study has been carried out for the understanding of this inhibition.},

We find several instabilities and classify these in terms of wave resonances. We briefly apply our results to the structure of SiO maser regions appearing in the winds from late-type stars.},

The high-frequency and the low-frequency branches are found to belong to right-hand and left-hand polarized waves, respectively.},

To date, detailed models of these processes have focused primarily on grains exposed to soft radiation fields. We provide new estimates of the photoelectric yield for neutral and charged carbonaceous and silicate grains, for photon energies exceeding 20 eV. We include the ejection of electrons from both the band structure of the material and the inner shells of the constituent atoms, as well as Auger and secondary electron emission. We apply the model to estimate gas-heating rates in planetary nebulae and grain charges in quasar environments. For these applications, secondary emission can be neglected; the combined effect of inner shell and Auger emission is small, although not always negligible. Finally, we investigate the survivability of dust in quasar host galaxies. For unobscured lines of sight, dust can be destroyed out to distances \$1 kpc.},

The infall of \textasciitilde meter-sized solids in a hundred years is the most stringent constraint. I review proposed mechanisms for planetesimal formation. Collisional coagulation models are informed by laboratory studies of microgravity collisions. The gravitational collapse (or Safronov-Goldreich-Ward) hypothesis involves detailed study of the interaction between solid particles and turbulent gas. I cover the basics of aerodynamic drag in protoplanetary disks, including radial drift and vertical sedimentation. I describe various mechanisms for particle concentration in gas disks -- including turbulent pressure maxima, drag instabilities and long-lived anticylonic vortices. I derive a general result for the minimum size for a vortex to trap particles in a sub-Keplerian disk. Recent numerical simulations demonstrate that particle clumping in turbulent protoplanetary disks can trigger gravitational collapse. I discuss several outstanding issues in the field.},

For a warm plasma with two charged particle species, the instability diagram of the two-stream instability based on a 1D warm-fluid model exhibits an interesting band structure that has not been explained. We show that the band structure for this instability is the consequence of the Hamiltonian nature of the warm two-fluid system. Interestingly, the Hamiltonian nature manifests as a complex G-Hamiltonian structure in wave-number space, which directly determines the instability diagram. Specifically, it is shown that the boundaries between the stable and unstable regions are locations for Krein collisions between eigenmodes with different Krein signatures. In terms of physics, this rigorously implies that the system is destabilized when a positive-action mode resonates with a negative-action mode, and that this is the only mechanism by which the system can be ...},

    "abstract": "As blockchain technology continues to gain attention, there is a growing need to make it more accessible to young learners in K-12 education. However, the technical complexity and lack of accessible tools have been identified as significant barriers to adoption. Our paper proposes a new method for empowering NFTs by continuously updating their metadata using an API layer. The approach aims to reduce the barriers to entry and enable K-12 students to explore blockchain technology in the same way they learn computational thinking through visual programming tools like Scratch. Our method utilizes Google Blockly, a visual programming language, to make updating NFT metadata more accessible and engaging for young learners. By leveraging a familiar and engaging visual programming language, students can develop their computational thinking skills and explore blockchain technology in a fun and intuitive way. The paper discusses the benefits of using NFTs as a learning tool, including how they can help students understand the concept of digital ownership and value. Overall, our proposed method has the potential to promote student engagement and understanding of blockchain technology, which could have significant implications for the future of education.",

    "abstract": "For a finite group $G$ and a conjugation-invariant subset $Q\\subseteq G$, we consider the Hurwitz space $\\mathrm{Hur}_n(Q)$ parametrising branched covers of the plane with $n$ branch points, monodromies in $G$ and local monodromies in $Q$. For $i\\ge0$ we prove that $\\bigoplus_n H_i(\\mathrm{Hur}_n(Q))$ is a finitely generated module over the ring $\\bigoplus_n H_0(\\mathrm{Hur}_n(Q))$. As a consequence, we obtain polynomial stability of homology of Hurwitz spaces: taking homology coefficients in a field, the dimension of $H_i(\\mathrm{Hur}_n(Q))$ agrees for $n$ large enough with a quasi-polynomial in $n$, whose degree is easily bounded in terms of $G$ and $Q$. Under suitable hypotheses on $G$ and $Q$, we prove classical homological stability for certain sequences of components of Hurwitz spaces. Our results generalise previous work of Ellenberg-Venkatesh-Westerland, and rely on techniques introduced by them and by Hatcher-Wahl.",

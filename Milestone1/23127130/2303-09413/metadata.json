    "abstract": "This essay explores the relations between aesthetics and motivation, primarily in quantum physics, focusing on the notions of play, beauty, and the joy of insight. The motivating role of these notions is examined both historically among the quantum pioneers and contemporarily, based on a series of interviews, among physicists associated with the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen.",

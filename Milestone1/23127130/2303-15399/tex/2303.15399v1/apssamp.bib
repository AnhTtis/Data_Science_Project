	abstract = {It is now generally agreed that the most dramatic influence of a free surface on local relaxation dynamics occurs over the first 10 nm from the surface. Using the cooperative free volume ({CFV}) rate model, we have linked a faster dynamic response to a lower density (i.e., greater available or free volume) closer to the interface. Experimental and simulation studies have shown that the relaxation profile is significantly broader than the local density profile. Here, we explain this difference using the {CFV} model to show that local relaxation can be enabled through accrual of a fixed amount of free volume, the value of which is a characteristic, material-dependent quantity. The process by which a relaxing segment acquires this volume involves a cooperative region whose length scale will change with density and therefore with distance from the interface. The result is a region-averaged position-dependent density profile that is significantly broadened and that links directly to the relaxation profile. Finally, we explain why these film confinement effects diminish in importance as the temperature is increased.},

	abstract = {The parametrization and testing of the {OPLS} all-atom force field for organic molecules and peptides are described. Parameters for both torsional and nonbonded energetics have been derived, while the bond stretching and angle bending parameters have been adopted mostly from the {AMBER} all-atom force field. The torsional parameters were determined by fitting to rotational energy profiles obtained from ab initio molecular orbital calculations at the {RHF}/6-31G*//{RHF}/6-31G* level for more than 50 organic molecules and ions. The quality of the fits was high with average errors for conformational energies of less than 0.2 kcal/mol. The force-field results for molecular structures are also demonstrated to closely match the ab initio predictions. The nonbonded parameters were developed in conjunction with Monte Carlo statistical mechanics simulations by computing thermodynamic and structural properties for 34 pure organic liquids including alkanes, alkenes, alcohols, ethers, acetals, thiols, sulfides, disulfides, aldehydes, ketones, and amides. Average errors in comparison with experimental data are 2\% for heats of vaporization and densities. The Monte Carlo simulations included sampling all internal and intermolecular degrees of freedom. It is found that such non-polar and monofunctional systems do not show significant condensed-phase effects on internal energies in going from the gas phase to the pure liquids.},

The transition is not abrupt, featuring progressive decrease of the microscopic mobility and huge slowing down of the relaxation. A distinctive aspect of glass-forming materials is the microscopic dynamical heterogeneity ({DH}), i.e., the presence of regions with almost immobile particles coexisting with others where highly mobile ones are located. Following the first compelling evidence of a strong correlation between vibrational dynamics and ultraslow relaxation, we posed the question if the vibrational dynamics encodes predictive information on {DH}. Here, we review our results, drawn from molecular-dynamics numerical simulation of polymeric and molecular glass-formers, with a special focus on both the breakdown of the Stokes–Einstein relation between diffusion and viscosity, and the size of the regions with correlated displacements.},

We examine the inter-relation between the string model, an outgrowth of the Adam and Gibbs approach that emphasizes collective particle exchange motion, and the localization model, which emphasizes the volume explored by particles in their caged states, a kind of dynamic “free volume.” Each model of liquid dynamics is described by a limited set of parameters that must be interrelated if both descriptions simultaneously describe the relaxation behavior. We pursue the consequences of this idea by performing coarse-grained molecular simulations of polymer melts with additives of variable size and interaction strength with the polymer matrix, thereby significantly altering the relaxation of the composite material. Both the string and localization models describe our relaxation time data well, and a comparison of the model parameters allows us to relate the local caging scale ⟨u2⟩ (the Debye-Waller parameter) to the entropy of activation for molecular rearrangements in the string model, thereby developing a bridge between these seemingly disparate approaches to liquid dynamics.},

What controls the sharp slowing down of molecular motion upon approaching the glass transition temperature Tg, whether there is an underlying thermodynamic transition at some finite temperature below Tg, what the role of cooperativity and heterogeneity are, and many other questions continue to be topics of active discussions. This review focuses on the mechanisms that control the steepness of the temperature dependence of structural relaxation (fragility) in glass-forming liquids. We present a brief overview of the basic theoretical models and their experimental tests, analyzing their predictions for fragility and emphasizing the successes and failures of the models. Special attention is focused on the connection of fast dynamics on picosecond time scales to the behavior of structural relaxation on much longer time scales. A separate section discusses the specific case of polymeric glass-forming liquids, which usually have extremely high fragility. We emphasize the apparent difference between the glass transitions in polymers and small molecules. We also discuss the possible role of quantum effects in the glass transition of light molecules and highlight the recent discovery of the unusually low fragility of water. At the end, we formulate the major challenges and questions remaining in this field.},

	abstract = {The study of glass formation is largely framed by semiempirical models that emphasize the importance of progressively growing cooperative motion accompanying the drop in fluid configurational entropy, emergent elasticity, or the vanishing of accessible free volume available for molecular motion in cooled liquids. We investigate the extent to which these descriptions are related through computations on a model coarse-grained polymer melt, with and without nanoparticle additives, and for supported polymer films with smooth or rough surfaces, allowing for substantial variation of the glass transition temperature and the fragility of glass formation. We find quantitative relations between emergent elasticity, the average local volume accessible for particle motion, and the growth of collective motion in cooled liquids. Surprisingly, we find that each of these models of glass formation can equally well describe the relaxation data for all of the systems that we simulate. In this way, we uncover some unity in our understanding of glass-forming materials from perspectives formerly considered as distinct.},

The parallel temperature variations of ⟨u2(T/Tg)⟩, τ3(T/Tg), and τα(T/Tg), and their similar patterns of change between the different glasses, are discussed in terms of anharmonicity in the intermolecular caging potentials and the subnanometer density heterogeneities.},

This behaviour of the fast relaxation is puzzling because the glass transition originates from the structure of the liquid falling out of equilibrium at temperatures where the α-relaxation time becomes long, for example 103 s. In this work, we consider a model proposed for the fast relaxation that is based on an extension of the coupling model to incorporate the dynamics of cage decay. Several properties of the fast relaxation are deduced from the model and shown to be consistent with the experimental data, including the appearance of a break at the glass transition temperature.},

	abstract = {A local segmental mobility was determined by electron spin resonance ({ESR}) spin-label method for a series of polystyrene ({PS}) with various molecular weights. Each {PS} specimen was selectively spin-labeled with stable nitroxide radicals at a chain end or inside sites. Molecular motion at the inside of the chain was compared with that at the chain end from the temperature dependence of {ESR} spectra of the nitroxide radicals. The transition temperature of molecular motion, T5.0mT, at which the extreme separation width due to 14N anisotropic hyperfine splitting is 5.0 {mT}, increased with an increase in molecular weight. The {WLF} equation confirmed that the T5.0mT correlated with a glass transition temperature, Tg, of {PS}. The T5.0mT for the spin-labeled {PS} at the chain end was ca. 5 K lower than that for the spin-labeled {PS} at the inside sites due to the enrichment of the specific free volume around the chain end. The transition temperature, T5.0mT, for both labeled {PS} depended on the molecular weight in accordance with the Unberreiter−Kanig equation for a glass transition. The T5.0mT for the spin-labeled {PS} at the chain end had a strong dependence on the molecular weight as compared with that at the inside sites because the molecular motion of the chain end was accelerated by an encounter of more than two chain ends. From the molecular weight dependence, we determined the short correlation time for segmental motion of the chain end, ca. 40 s, and the segment size undergoing the segmental motion at the Tg. The obtained segment size agreed well with the general segment size reported by others, 5−10 monomeric unit size.},

	abstract = {Many solid state properties are correlated to simple parameters like the atomic mass, the interatomic distance and some measure of the strength of the interatomic interaction, e.g. the melting temperature Tm or some Debye temperature Î¸D. Such empirical relations are investigated for elastic properties, melting temperature, thermal expansion, vacancy formation energy, grain boundary and surface energy, cohesive energy, heat of fusion, activation energies for bulk, grain boundary, surface and dislocation pipe diffusion, viscosity, activation energy for creep, recrystallization temperature and other properties. When experimental data are available, both elements and diatomic compounds (alkali halides, oxides, carbides, {III}-V semiconductors) are considered. The correlations to Tm, Î¸D(T = 0) and a high temperature effective Î¸D are compared. It is found that for all practical purposes Tm gives the best correlation. For diatomic compounds, the average mass is not uniquely defined and various averages are discussed. The purpose of the paper is not only to present empirical relations but also to give a short account of the possibilities to calculate the considered parameters using solid state theory in its most advanced present state.},

Any student with a working knowledge of calculus, physics and chemistry should be able to read this book. The essential tools of the polymer physical chemist or engineer are derived in this book without skipping any steps. The book is a self-contained treatise that could also serve as a useful reference for scientists and engineers working with polymers. While no prior knowledge of polymers is assumed, the book goes far beyond introductory polymer texts in the scope of what is covered. The fundamental concepts required to fully understand polymer melts, solutions and gels in terms of both static structure and dynamics are explained in detail. Problems at the end of each Chapter provide the reader with the opportunity to apply what has been learned to practice. The book is divided into four parts. After an introduction in Chapter 1, where the necessary concepts from a first course on polymers are summarized, the conformations of single polymer chains are treated in Part 1. Part 2 deals with the thermodynamics of polymer solutions and melts, including the conformations of chains in those states. Part 3 applies the concepts of Part 2 to the formation and properties of polymer networks. Finally, Part 4 explains the essential aspects of how polymers move in both melt and solution states. In all cases, attention is restricted to concepts that are firmly entrenched in the field.},

	shorttitle = {Universal localization transition accompanying glass formation},
	abstract = {The origin of the precipitous dynamic arrest known as the glass transition is a grand open question of soft condensed matter physics. It has long been suspected that this transition is driven by an onset of particle localization and associated emergence of a glassy modulus. However, progress towards an accepted understanding of glass formation has been impeded by an inability to obtain data sufficient in chemical diversity, relaxation timescales, and spatial and temporal resolution to validate or falsify proposed theories for its physics. Here we first describe a strategy enabling facile high-throughput simulation of glass-forming liquids to nearly unprecedented relaxation times. We then perform simulations of 51 glass-forming liquids, spanning polymers, small organic molecules, inorganics, and metallic glass-formers, with longest relaxation times exceeding one microsecond. Results identify a universal particle-localization transition accompanying glass formation across all classes of glass-forming liquid. The onset temperature of non-Arrhenius dynamics is found to serve as a normalizing condition leading to a master collapse of localization data. This transition exhibits a non-universal relationship with dynamic arrest, suggesting that the nonuniversality of supercooled liquid dynamics enters via the dependence of relaxation times on local cage scale. These results suggest that a universal particle-localization transition may underpin the glass transition, and they emphasize the potential for recent theoretical developments connecting relaxation to localization and emergent elasticity to finally explain the origin of this phenomenon. More broadly, the capacity for high-throughput prediction of glass formation behavior may open the door to computational inverse design of glass-forming materials.},

	abstract = {Since the classical molecular dynamics simulator {LAMMPS} was released as an open source code in 2004, it has become a widely-used tool for particle-based modeling of materials at length scales ranging from atomic to mesoscale to continuum. Reasons for its popularity are that it provides a wide variety of particle interaction models for different materials, that it runs on any platform from a single {CPU} core to the largest supercomputers with accelerators, and that it gives users control over simulation details, either via the input script or by adding code for new interatomic potentials, constraints, diagnostics, or other features needed for their models. As a result, hundreds of people have contributed new capabilities to {LAMMPS} and it has grown from fifty thousand lines of code in 2004 to a million lines today. In this paper several of the fundamental algorithms used in {LAMMPS} are described along with the design strategies which have made it flexible for both users and developers. We also highlight some capabilities recently added to the code which were enabled by this flexibility, including dynamic load balancing, on-the-fly visualization, magnetic spin dynamics models, and quantum-accuracy machine learning interatomic potentials.

Program Title: Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator ({LAMMPS}) {CPC} Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/cxbxs9btsv.1 Developer's repository link: https://github.com/lammps/lammps Licensing provisions: {GPLv}2 Programming language: C++, Python, C, Fortran Supplementary material: https://www.lammps.org Nature of problem: Many science applications in physics, chemistry, materials science, and related fields require parallel, scalable, and efficient generation of long, stable classical particle dynamics trajectories. Within this common problem definition, there lies a great diversity of use cases, distinguished by different particle interaction models, external constraints, as well as timescales and lengthscales ranging from atomic to mesoscale to macroscopic. Solution method: The {LAMMPS} code uses parallel spatial decomposition, distributed neighbor lists, and parallel {FFTs} for long-range Coulombic interactions [1]. The time integration algorithm is based on the Størmer-Verlet symplectic integrator [2], which provides better stability than higher-order non-symplectic methods. In addition, {LAMMPS} supports a wide range of interatomic potentials, constraints, diagnostics, software interfaces, and pre- and post-processing features. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: This paper serves as the definitive reference for the {LAMMPS} code.

This allows first-principles, no adjustable parameter calculations to be performed for the temperature-dependent mean segmental relaxation time of chemically diverse van der Waals polymers over a wide range of molecular weights. Despite the simplicity of the mapping, the theory does a good job of a priori predicting the glass transition temperature (Tg), the dynamic fragility, and full temperature dependence of the α-relaxation time for some high molecular weight polymers and the chain length dependence of Tg as the consequence of the molecular weight dependence of backbone stiffness. The minimalist model does not capture the unusually low and high fragilities of certain long chain polymers which are not typical of van der Waals molecular liquids. This seems likely due to the simple coarse graining adopted which ignores longer range chain connectivity and nonuniversal factors on the sub-Kuhn length scale. Elasticity, not of an entropic single chain origin, emerges in deeply supercooled polymer liquids due to transient segmental localization and is studied at the microscopic stress-tensor level. Calculations of the frequency-dependent dynamic storage modulus close to Tg appear to be qualitatively consistent with recent measurements.},

The subclasses of molecular glasses with homologous chemical structure but different M exhibit a similar universal correlation with signiﬁcantly lower scatter. A possible explanation of Tg vs M correlation in molecular glasses is suggested. Comparing molecular glasses with polymers we found that in polymers Tg(M) dependence at small M (short chains) is similar to that in molecular glasses. At further increasing of the chain length the Tg(M) dependence in polymers begin to deviate from the universal Tg(M) correlation of molecular glasses and eventually saturates at some polymer speciﬁc {TgN} value. We conclude that at least a substantial part of Tg(M) dependence of low-M polymers is common with molecular glasses mechanism that does not require chain-like structure. In particular, the model of Tg(M) dependence in polymers based on additional free volume on chain ends is not fully adequate at small M. Our picture provides an alternative explanation that in polymers a mechanism is in action which leads to a saturation of the normal Tg(M) dependence common with molecular glasses.},

The same conclusions could be drawn from the volume-temperature curves of these mixtures as were drawn from the data for pure fractions in an earlier paper. Regarding the thermal expansion coefficients (dv/{dT})liq. and (dv/{dT})sol. and the specific volumes above the transition temperature υliq., the mixtures behave as ideal mixtures composed of chain end and middle groups. The end groups act as plasticizers and cause the “self-plasticization” of the polymer. From the fact of an “iso-oscillation volume” at the transition temperature, a relationship between second-order transition temperature, Tg, and the mole fraction of the end groups, Ne, was derived. An explanation is given for the statements of Alexandrov and Lazurkin that high polymers plasticized by their monomers show softening temperatures which are independent of the molecular weight of the high polymer and depend only on the percentage of monomer.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have shown that the method of hydrogen mass repartitioning (HMR) is a potentially useful tool for accelerating molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. By repartitioning the mass of heavy atoms into the bonded hydrogen atoms, it is possible to slow the highest-frequency motions of the macromolecule under study, thus allowing the time step of the simulation to be increased by up to a factor of 2. In this communication, we investigate further how this mass repartitioning allows the simulation time step to be increased in a stable fashion without signiﬁcantly increasing discretization error. To this end, we ran a set of simulations with diﬀerent time steps and mass distributions on a three-residue peptide to get a comprehensive view of the eﬀect of mass repartitioning and time step increase on a system whose accessible phase space is fully explored in a relatively short amount of time. We next studied a 129-residue protein, hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL), to verify that the observed behavior extends to a larger, more-realistic, system. Results for the protein include structural comparisons from MD trajectories, as well as comparisons of pKa calculations via constant-pH MD. We also calculated a potential of mean force (PMF) of a dihedral rotation for the MTS [(1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-pyrroline-3-methyl)methanethiosulfonate] spin label via umbrella sampling with a set of regular MD trajectories, as well as a set of mass-repartitioned trajectories with a time step of 4 fs. Since no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in kinetics or thermodynamics is observed by the use of fast HMR trajectories, further evidence is provided that long-time-step HMR MD simulations are a viable tool for accelerating MD simulations for molecules of biochemical interest.},

We present a model offering an improved description of the viscosity–temperature relationship for both inorganic and organic liquids using the same number of parameters as {VFT} and {AM}. The model has a clear physical foundation based on the temperature dependence of configurational entropy, and it offers an accurate prediction of low-temperature isokoms without any singularity at finite temperature.

	abstract = {We analyze the temperature dependence of the segmental relaxation time τ of several low-Tg polymers with varying molar masses (M) as obtained from ﬁeld-cycling 1H {NMR} relaxometry and dielectric spectroscopy. They are compared with those of molecular liquids ({ML}). Time constants in the range 3 × 10−12 s−1000 s, i.e., between Tg and 413 K, are covered. Describing τ(T) by the Vogel−Fulcher−Tammann ({VFT}) eq a systematic diﬀerence with respect to {ML} is found. While {VFT} fails for the latter it works well for polymers. The apparent activation energy at high temperatures shows a trend toward a temperature independent value E∞. For polymers, its Mdependence follows that of Tg(M), thus E∞(M) can be described by a Fox−Flory equation. Attempting to understand the diﬀerence among the two classes of liquids, we take recourse to our approach ﬁrst applied to {ML} [J. Chem. Phys. 2013, 139, 084504]; i.e., we decompose the temperature-dependent activation energy E(T) controlling τ(T) in a constant high-temperature value E∞(M) and a “cooperative part” Ecoop(T). The latter turns out to depend exponentially on temperature, as in {ML}. Introducing a plot in terms of Ecoop(T)/E∞ vs T/E∞, a master curve for each polymer series is revealed. Taking averaged parameters for all polymers a three-parameter ﬁt well interpolates τ(T) up to highest temperatures. Describing molecular and polymer liquids within the same approach, the diﬀerence lies in the fact that the ratio E∞/Ecoop(Tg) is systematically higher for polymers; i.e., τ(T) displays an Arrhenius behavior extending over a larger temperature range.},

	abstract = {While molecular simulations have contributed to the modern understanding of the glass transition, they are constrained in prediction of experimental glass temperatures Tg because they are limited to times far shorter than those associated with experimental glass formation. Here, we bridge this gap via a model-based forecasting approach. We assess models of the temperature dependence of dynamics in glass forming liquids based upon the rate at which their prediction of Tg and fragility converge upon incorporating increasingly long timescale data. We find that the Cooperative Model of Schmidtke et al. typically provides the best predictions, ultimately enabling good Tg predictions from all-atom simulations of a range of polymers. Together with a protocol for efficient simulation of dynamics in glass-forming liquids, this strategy enables high-throughput computational screening of the glass transition. The success of the Cooperative Model in predicting low temperature behavior adds support to the two-barrier scenario underlying this model.},

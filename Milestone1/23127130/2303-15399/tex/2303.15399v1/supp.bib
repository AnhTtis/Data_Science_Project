	abstract = {We analyze the temperature dependence of the segmental relaxation time τ of several low-Tg polymers with varying molar masses (M) as obtained from ﬁeld-cycling 1H {NMR} relaxometry and dielectric spectroscopy. They are compared with those of molecular liquids ({ML}). Time constants in the range 3 × 10−12 s−1000 s, i.e., between Tg and 413 K, are covered. Describing τ(T) by the Vogel−Fulcher−Tammann ({VFT}) eq a systematic diﬀerence with respect to {ML} is found. While {VFT} fails for the latter it works well for polymers. The apparent activation energy at high temperatures shows a trend toward a temperature independent value E∞. For polymers, its Mdependence follows that of Tg(M), thus E∞(M) can be described by a Fox−Flory equation. Attempting to understand the diﬀerence among the two classes of liquids, we take recourse to our approach ﬁrst applied to {ML} [J. Chem. Phys. 2013, 139, 084504]; i.e., we decompose the temperature-dependent activation energy E(T) controlling τ(T) in a constant high-temperature value E∞(M) and a “cooperative part” Ecoop(T). The latter turns out to depend exponentially on temperature, as in {ML}. Introducing a plot in terms of Ecoop(T)/E∞ vs T/E∞, a master curve for each polymer series is revealed. Taking averaged parameters for all polymers a three-parameter ﬁt well interpolates τ(T) up to highest temperatures. Describing molecular and polymer liquids within the same approach, the diﬀerence lies in the fact that the ratio E∞/Ecoop(Tg) is systematically higher for polymers; i.e., τ(T) displays an Arrhenius behavior extending over a larger temperature range.},

Unfortunately, existing viscosity models, such as the Vogel–Fulcher–Tammann ({VFT}) and Avramov–Milchev ({AM}) equations, exhibit systematic error when extrapolating to low temperatures. We present a model offering an improved description of the viscosity–temperature relationship for both inorganic and organic liquids using the same number of parameters as {VFT} and {AM}. The model has a clear physical foundation based on the temperature dependence of configurational entropy, and it offers an accurate prediction of low-temperature isokoms without any singularity at finite temperature. Our results cast doubt on the existence of a Kauzmann entropy catastrophe and associated ideal glass transition.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have shown that the method of hydrogen mass repartitioning ({HMR}) is a potentially useful tool for accelerating molecular dynamics ({MD}) simulations. By repartitioning the mass of heavy atoms into the bonded hydrogen atoms, it is possible to slow the highest-frequency motions of the macromolecule under study, thus allowing the time step of the simulation to be increased by up to a factor of 2. In this communication, we investigate further how this mass repartitioning allows the simulation time step to be increased in a stable fashion without signiﬁcantly increasing discretization error. To this end, we ran a set of simulations with diﬀerent time steps and mass distributions on a three-residue peptide to get a comprehensive view of the eﬀect of mass repartitioning and time step increase on a system whose accessible phase space is fully explored in a relatively short amount of time. We next studied a 129-residue protein, hen egg white lysozyme ({HEWL}), to verify that the observed behavior extends to a larger, more-realistic, system. Results for the protein include structural comparisons from {MD} trajectories, as well as comparisons of {pKa} calculations via constant-{pH} {MD}. We also calculated a potential of mean force ({PMF}) of a dihedral rotation for the {MTS} [(1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-pyrroline-3-methyl)methanethiosulfonate] spin label via umbrella sampling with a set of regular {MD} trajectories, as well as a set of mass-repartitioned trajectories with a time step of 4 fs. Since no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in kinetics or thermodynamics is observed by the use of fast {HMR} trajectories, further evidence is provided that long-time-step {HMR} {MD} simulations are a viable tool for accelerating {MD} simulations for molecules of biochemical interest.},

	abstract = {While molecular simulations have contributed to the modern understanding of the glass transition, they are constrained in prediction of experimental glass temperatures Tg because they are limited to times far shorter than those associated with experimental glass formation. Here, we bridge this gap via a model-based forecasting approach. We assess models of the temperature dependence of dynamics in glass forming liquids based upon the rate at which their prediction of Tg and fragility converge upon incorporating increasingly long timescale data. We find that the Cooperative Model of Schmidtke et al. typically provides the best predictions, ultimately enabling good Tg predictions from all-atom simulations of a range of polymers. Together with a protocol for efficient simulation of dynamics in glass-forming liquids, this strategy enables high-throughput computational screening of the glass transition. The success of the Cooperative Model in predicting low temperature behavior adds support to the two-barrier scenario underlying this model.},

	shorttitle = {Universal localization transition accompanying glass formation},
	abstract = {The origin of the precipitous dynamic arrest known as the glass transition is a grand open question of soft condensed matter physics. It has long been suspected that this transition is driven by an onset of particle localization and associated emergence of a glassy modulus. However, progress towards an accepted understanding of glass formation has been impeded by an inability to obtain data sufficient in chemical diversity, relaxation timescales, and spatial and temporal resolution to validate or falsify proposed theories for its physics. Here we first describe a strategy enabling facile high-throughput simulation of glass-forming liquids to nearly unprecedented relaxation times. We then perform simulations of 51 glass-forming liquids, spanning polymers, small organic molecules, inorganics, and metallic glass-formers, with longest relaxation times exceeding one microsecond. Results identify a universal particle-localization transition accompanying glass formation across all classes of glass-forming liquid. The onset temperature of non-Arrhenius dynamics is found to serve as a normalizing condition leading to a master collapse of localization data. This transition exhibits a non-universal relationship with dynamic arrest, suggesting that the nonuniversality of supercooled liquid dynamics enters via the dependence of relaxation times on local cage scale. These results suggest that a universal particle-localization transition may underpin the glass transition, and they emphasize the potential for recent theoretical developments connecting relaxation to localization and emergent elasticity to finally explain the origin of this phenomenon. More broadly, the capacity for high-throughput prediction of glass formation behavior may open the door to computational inverse design of glass-forming materials.},

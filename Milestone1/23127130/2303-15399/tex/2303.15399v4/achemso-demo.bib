	abstract = {We survey results of computer simulations for the structure and dynamics of supercooled polymer melts and films. Our survey is mainly concerned with features of a coarse grained polymer model—a bead–spring model—in the temperature regime above the critical glass temperature Tc of the ideal mode-coupling theory ({MCT}). We divide our discussion into two parts: a part devoted to bulk properties and a part dealing with thin films. The discussion of the bulk properties focuses on two aspects: a comparison of the simulation results with {MCT} and an analysis of dynamic heterogeneities. We explain in detail how the analyses are performed and what results may be obtained, and we critically assess their strengths and weaknesses. In discussing the application of {MCT} we also present first results of a quantitative comparison which does not rely on fits, but exploits static input from the simulation to predict the relaxation dynamics. The second part of this review is devoted to extensions of the simulations from the bulk to thin films. We explore in detail the influence of the boundary condition, imposed by smooth or rough walls, on the structure and dynamics of the polymer melt. Geometric confinement is found to shift the glass transition temperature Tg (or Tc in our case) relative to the bulk. We compare our and other simulation results for the Tg shift with experimental data, briefly survey some theoretical ideas for explaining these shifts and discuss related simulation work on the glass transition of confined liquids. Finally, we also present some technical details of how to perform fits to {MCT} and give a brief introduction to another approach to the glass transition based on the potential energy landscape of a liquid.},

We find that the relaxation dynamics shows an exponential dependence on c. This result can be rationalized by assuming that the configurational entropy of the pinned liquid decreases linearly upon increasing of c. This behavior is discussed in the context of thermodynamic theories for the glass transition, notably the Adam-Gibbs picture and the random first order transition theory. For intermediate and low temperatures we find that the slowing down of the dynamics due to the pinning saturates and that the cooperativity decreases with increasing c, results which indicate that in glass-forming liquids there is a dynamic crossover at which the shape of the relaxing entities changes.},

Furthermore we show that, due to the broken symmetry imposed by the wall, signatures of an additional change in dynamics become apparent at a temperature well above Tc. We provide evidence that this modification in the relaxation dynamics occurs at a recently proposed dynamical crossover temperature Ts{\textgreater}Tc, which is related to the breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein relation. We find that this dynamical crossover at Ts is also observed for the harmonic spheres as well as a {WCA} liquid, showing that it may be a general feature of glass-forming systems.},

Recent studies suggest that this widespread phenomenon is accompanied by spatially heterogeneous dynamics, and a growing dynamic correlation length quantifying the extent of correlated particle motion. Here we use a novel numerical method to detect and quantify spatial correlations that reveal a surprising non-monotonic temperature evolution of spatial dynamical correlations, accompanied by a second length scale that grows monotonically and has a very different nature. Our results directly unveil a dramatic qualitative change in atomic motions near the mode-coupling crossover temperature, which involves no fitting or indirect theoretical interpretation. These findings impose severe new constraints on the theoretical description of the glass transition, and open several research perspectives, in particular for experiments, to confirm and quantify our observations in real materials.},

	abstract = {We present the results of molecular dynamics computer simulations of a binary Lennard-Jones liquid confined between two parallel rough walls. These walls are realized by frozen amorphous configurations of the same liquid and therefore the structural properties of the confined fluid are identical to the ones of the bulk system. Hence, this setup allows us to study how the relaxation dynamics is affected by the pure effect of confinement, i.e., if structural changes are completely avoided. We find that the local relaxation dynamics is a strong function of z, the distance of the particles from the wall, and that close to the surface the typical relaxation times are orders of magnitude larger than the ones in the bulk. Because of the cooperative nature of the particle dynamics, the slow dynamics also affects the dynamics of the particles for large values of z. Using various empirical laws, we are able to parametrize accurately the z dependence of the generalized incoherent intermediate scattering function Fs(q,z,t) and also the spatial dependence of structural relaxation times. These laws allow us to determine various dynamical length scales and we find that their temperature dependence is compatible with an Arrhenius law. Furthermore, we find that, at low temperatures, time- and space-dependent correlation functions fulfill a generalized factorization property similar to the one predicted by mode-coupling theory for bulk systems. For thin films and/or at sufficiently low temperatures, we find that the relaxation dynamics is influenced by the two walls in a strongly nonlinear way in that the slowing down is much stronger than the one expected from the presence of only one confining wall. Finally, we study the average dynamics of all liquid particles and find that the data can be described very well by a superposition of two relaxation processes that have clearly separated time scales. Since this is in contrast with the result of our analysis of the local dynamics, we argue that a correct interpretation of experimental data can be rather difficult.},

We explore the influence of confinement on the structure and dynamics of the polymer films. We find that the dynamics in the films is accelerated compared to the bulk, that this enhanced mobility originates from the surfaces, and that the effect is larger at the free than at the supported surface. Thus, the films have lower Tc values relative to the bulk. Tc depends on film thickness h; this dependence can be well parametrized by Tc(h) = T/(1 + h0/h), a function proposed by experiments on supported polystyrene films. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {Many emerging materials, such as ultrastable glasses1,2 of interest for phone displays and {OLED} television screens, owe their properties to a gradient of enhanced mobility at the surface of glass-forming liquids. The discovery of this surface mobility enhancement3–5 has reshaped our understanding of the behaviour of glass formers and of how to fashion them into improved materials. In polymeric glasses, these interfacial modifications are complicated by the existence of a second length scale—the size of the polymer chain—as well as the length scale of the interfacial mobility gradient6–9. Here we present simulations, theory and time-resolved surface nano-creep experiments to reveal that this two-scale nature of glassy polymer surfaces drives the emergence of a transient rubbery, entangled-like surface behaviour even in polymers comprised of short, subentangled chains. We find that this effect emerges from superposed gradients in segmental dynamics and chain conformational statistics. The lifetime of this rubbery behaviour, which will have broad implications in constraining surface relaxations central to applications including tribology, adhesion, and surface healing of polymeric glasses, extends as the material is cooled. The surface layers suffer a general breakdown in time−temperature superposition ({TTS}), a fundamental tenet of polymer physics and rheology. This finding may require a reevaluation of strategies for the prediction of long-time properties in polymeric glasses with high interfacial areas. We expect that this interfacial transient elastomer effect and {TTS} breakdown should normally occur in macromolecular systems ranging from nanocomposites to thin films, where interfaces dominate material properties5,10.},

	shorttitle = {Are polymers standard glass-forming systems?},
	abstract = {Traditionally, polymer melts have been considered archetypal glass-formers. This has been mainly due to the fact that these systems can easily be obtained as glasses by cooling from the melt, even at low cooling rates. However, the macromolecules, i.e. the structural units of polymer systems in general, are rather different from the standard molecules. They are long objects (‘chains’) made by repetition of a given chemical motif (monomer) and have intra-macromolecular barriers that limit their flexibility. The influence of these properties on, for instance, the glass-transition temperature of polymers, is a topic that has been widely studied by the polymer community almost from the early times of polymer science. However, in the framework of the glass-community, the relevant influence of intra-macromolecular barriers and chain connectivity on glass-transition phenomena of polymers has started to be recognized only recently. The aim of this review is to give an overview and to critically revise the results reported on this topic over the last years. From these results, it seems to be evident that there are two different mechanisms involved in the dynamic arrest in glass-forming polymers: (i) the intermolecular packing effects, which dominate the dynamic arrest of low molecular weight glass-forming systems; and (ii) the effect of intra-macromolecular barriers combined with chain connectivity. It has also been shown that the mode coupling theory ({MCT}) is a suitable theoretical framework to discuss these questions. The values found for polymers for the central {MCT} parameter—the so-called λ-exponent—are of the order of 0.9, clearly higher than the standard values (λ ≈ 0.7) found in systems where the dynamic arrest is mainly driven by packing effects (‘standard’ glass-formers). Within the {MCT}, this is a signature of the presence of two competing mechanisms of dynamic arrest, as it has been observed in short-ranged attractive colloids or two component mixtures with dynamic asymmetry. Moreover, recent {MD}-simulations of a ‘bead-spring’ polymer model, but including intra-macromolecular potential of different strengths, confirm that the high λ-values found in polymers are due to the effect of intra-macromolecular barriers. Although there are still open questions, these results allow to conclude that there is a fundamental difference between the nature of the glass transition in polymers and in simple (standard) glass-formers.},

	abstract = {Polymeric ionic liquids ({PILs}) are of considerable interest as next-generation battery materials due to their potential to combine the solid-state stability of polymers with the high ion conductivities of ionic liquids. However, polymerization of ionic liquids to form a polymer generally leads to a suppression in ion transport rates that has proven to be a major barrier to the realization of commercially viable {PIL} solid electrolytes. Here we employ a combination of all atom and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to identify strategies by which ion conductivity can be maximized by maximizing both {PIL} segmental relaxation rates and the extent of ion transport decoupling from chain dynamics. Results indicate that combined ion size correlates well with {PIL} glass transition temperatures and segmental dynamics but that ion/polymer decoupling is controlled primarily by the size of the free ion. We also find that ion aggregation promotes both reduced glass transition temperatures and enhanced ion/polymer decoupling. These results suggest that {PIL} ion mobility can be improved by combining ultralarge bound ions with very small free ions and with chemistries that promote ion aggregation.},

Here we explain this difference using our recently established chemistry-specific coarse-grained ({CG}) models for these two polymers. Models capture the dissimilar scaling of Tg with free-standing film thickness as seen in experiments and enable us to quantify the size of the regions near free surfaces over which chain relaxation exhibits differences from bulk. Most interestingly, vibrational density of states ({VDOS}) analysis uncovers a relationship between the amplitude of side-chain fluctuations, associated with side-chain flexibility and Tg-nanoconfinement. We discover that increasing backbone to side-chain mass ratio in {CG} models increases the amplitude of side-chain fluctuations and suppresses the free-surface effect on Tg. We show that mass distribution and side-chain flexibility are central to explain dissimilar free surface effects on {PS} and {PMMA}. Our model predictions are further corroborated by experimental evidence showing the role of mass distribution in styrene thin films. Our study ascertains the significance of molecular characteristics on nanoconfinement and highlights the ability for chemistry-specific {CG} models to explore the thermomechanical properties of polymer thin films.},

Inspired by Sokolov and Schweizer’s suggestion that this thermorheological complexity is a consequence of dynamic heterogeneity in the supercooled state, we generalize the Rouse model to account for a distribution of segmental mobilities. The heterogeneous Rouse model ({HRM}) predicts chain translational normal mode decoupling as a manifestation of diffusion/relaxation decoupling (Stokes–Einstein breakdown)—a consequence of differences in how normal modes average over a distribution of segmental mobilities.

Results indicate that nanoconfined Tg depends linearly on interfacial adhesion energy, with a slope that scales exponentially with the ratio of the bulk Debye?Waller factors ?u2? of the confined and confining materials. These trends, together with a convergence at low interfacial adhesion energy to the Tg of an equivalent freestanding film, are captured in a single functional form, with only three parameters explicitly referring to the confined state. The observed dependence on ?u2? indicates that softness of nanoconfinement should be defined in terms of the relative high frequency shear moduli, rather than low frequency moduli or relaxation times, of the confined and confining materials.},

	abstract = {Despite extensive efforts, a definitive picture of the glass transition of ultra-thin polymer films has yet to emerge. The effect of film thickness h on the glass transition temperature Tg has been widely examined, but this characterization does not account for the fragility of glass-formation, which quantifies how rapidly relaxation times vary with temperature T. Accordingly, we simulate supported polymer films of a bead-spring model and determine both Tg and fragility, both as a function of h and film depth. We contrast changes in the relaxation dynamics with density ρ and demonstrate the limitations of the commonly invoked free-volume layer model. As opposed to bulk polymer materials, we find that the fragility and Tg do not generally vary proportionately. Consequently, the determination of the fragility profile—both locally and for the film as a whole—is essential for the characterization of changes in film dynamics with confinement.},

	abstract = {We apply the quiescent and mechanically driven versions of nonlinear Langevin equation theory to study how particle softness influences the shear modulus, the connection between shear elasticity and activated relaxation, and nonlinear rheology of the repulsive Hertzian contact model of dense soft sphere fluids. Below the soft jamming threshold, the shear modulus follows a power law dependence on volume fraction over a narrow interval with an apparent exponent that grows with particle stiffness. To a first approximation, the elastic modulus and transient localization length are controlled by a single coupling constant determined by local fluid structure. In contrast to the behavior of hard spheres, an approximately linear relation between the shear modulus and activation barrier is predicted. This connection has recently been observed for microgel suspensions and provides a microscopic realization of the elastic shoving model. Yielding, shear and stress thinning of the alpha relaxation time and viscosity, and flow curves are also studied. Yield strains are relatively weakly dependent on volume fraction and particle stiffness. Shear thinning commences at values of the effective Peclet number far less than unity, a signature of stress-assisted activated relaxation when barriers are high. Apparent power law reduction of the viscosity with shear rate is predicted with a thinning exponent less than unity. In the vicinity of the soft jamming threshold, a power law flow curve occurs over an intermediate reduced shear rate range with an apparent exponent that decreases as fluid volume fraction and/or repulsion strength increase.},

Surprisingly, the Maxwell model predicts a plateau onset time which, while capable of reducing the measured mean-square displacements to a master curve, also grossly underestimates the actual plateau onset time. The predicted rescaling is shown to be essentially that also predicted by the Doi-Edwards tube model for polymer solutions under good solvent (excluded volume) conditions where a more proper accounting of the short-time dynamics is made.

	abstract = {When we lower the temperature of a liquid, at some point we meet a first order phase transition to the crystal. Yet, under certain conditions it is possible to keep the system in its metastable phase and to avoid crystallization. In this way the liquid enters in the supercooled phase. Supercooled liquids have a very rich phenomenology, which is still far from being completely understood. To begin with, there is the problem of how to prevent crystallization and how deeply the liquid can be supercooled before a metastability limit is hit. But by far the most interesting feature of supercooled liquids is the dynamic glass transition: when the temperature is decreased below a certain point, the relaxation time increases so much that a dramatic dynamical arrest intervenes and we are unable to equilibrate the system within reasonable experimental times. The glass transition is a phenomenon whose physical origin has stirred an enormous interest in the last hundred years. Why does it occur? Is it just a conventional reference point, or does it have a more profound physical meaning? Is it a purely dynamical event, or the manifestation of a true thermodynamic transition? What is the correlation length associated to the sharp increase of the relaxation time? Can we define a new kind of amorphous order? A shared theory of supercooled liquids and the glass transition does not yet exist and these questions are still largely open. Here, I will illustrate in the most elementary fashion the main phenomenological traits of supercooled liquids and discuss in a very partial way a few theoretical ideas on the subject.

Here we show that the form of spatial gradients of the glass transition temperature and structural relaxation time near an interface indeed provide signatures of the nature of relaxation in bulk glass-forming liquids. We report the results of long-time, large-system molecular dynamics simulations of thick glass-forming polymer films with one vapour interface, supported on a dynamically neutral substrate. We find that gradients in the glass transition temperature and logarithm of the structural relaxation time nucleated at a vapour interface exhibit two distinct regimes: a medium-ranged, large-amplitude exponential gradient, followed by a long-range slowly decaying tail that can be described by an inverse power law. This behaviour disagrees with multiple proposed theories of glassy dynamics but is predicted by the ‘elastically collective nonlinear Langevin equation’ theory as a consequence of two coupled mechanisms: a medium-ranged interface-nucleated gradient of surface-modified local caging constraints, and an interfacial truncation of a long-ranged collective elastic field. These findings support a coupled spatially local–nonlocal mechanism of activated glassy relaxation and kinetic vitrification in both the isotropic bulk and in broken-symmetry films.},

Here we employ molecular dynamics simulations to show that diluent-induced changes in a polymer?s glass transition temperature Tg can be predicted based on the diluent?s Debye?Waller factor ?u2?, a measure of picosecond time scale rattle-space, via a functional form previously found to predict nanoconfinement-induced shifts in polymer Tg. Moreover, we show that diluent-induced alterations in polymer segmental relaxation time are related to changes in modulus and ?u2? via the Generalized Localization Model of relaxation. These results provide new design principles for the use of oligomeric diluents in achieving independent, targeted control of structural relaxation and glassy moduli.},

Investigation of the local interfacial properties reveals that the increase in the local free volume near the free surface is greater for low MW, explaining the MW dependence of T-g-confinement behaviors.

	abstract = {Building on the elastically collective nonlinear Langevin equation theory developed for hard spheres in Paper I, we propose and implement a quasi-universal theory for the alpha relaxation of thermal liquids based on mapping them to an effective hard sphere fluid via the dimensionless compressibility. The result is a zero adjustable parameter theory that can quantitatively address in a unified manner the alpha relaxation time over 14 or more decades. The theory has no singularities above zero Kelvin, and relaxation in the equilibrium low temperature limit is predicted to be of a roughly Arrhenius form. The two-barrier (local cage and long range collective elastic) description results in a rich dynamic behavior including apparent Arrhenius, narrow crossover, and deeply supercooled regimes, and multiple characteristic or crossover times and temperatures of clear physical meaning. Application of the theory to nonpolar molecules, alcohols, rare gases, and liquids metals is carried out. Overall, the agreement with experiment is quite good for the temperature dependence of the alpha time, plateau shear modulus, and Boson-like peak frequency for van der Waals liquids, though less so for hydrogen-bonding molecules. The theory predicts multiple growing length scales upon cooling, which reflect distinct aspects of the coupled local hopping and cooperative elastic physics. Calculations of the growth with cooling of an activation volume, which is strongly correlated with a measure of dynamic cooperativity, agree quantitatively with experiment. Comparisons with elastic, entropy crisis, dynamic facilitation, and other approaches are performed, and a fundamental basis for empirically extracted crossover temperatures is established. The present work sets the stage for addressing distinctive glassy phenomena in polymer melts, and diverse liquids under strong confinement.},

	abstract = {We generalize the force-level nonlinear Langevin equation theory of single particle hopping to include collective effects associated with long range elastic distortion of the liquid. The activated alpha relaxation event is of a mixed spatial character, involving two distinct, but inter-related, local and collective barriers. There are no divergences at volume fractions below jamming or temperatures above zero Kelvin. The ideas are first developed and implemented analytically and numerically in the context of hard sphere fluids. In an intermediate volume fraction crossover regime, the local cage process is dominant in a manner consistent with an apparent Arrhenius behavior. The super-Arrhenius collective barrier is more strongly dependent on volume fraction, dominates the highly viscous regime, and is well described by a nonsingular law below jamming. The increase of the collective barrier is determined by the amplitude of thermal density fluctuations, dynamic shear modulus or transient localization length, and a growing microscopic jump length. Alpha relaxation time calculations are in good agreement with recent experiments and simulations on dense fluids and suspensions of hard spheres. Comparisons of the theory with elastic models and entropy crisis ideas are explored. The present work provides a foundation for constructing a quasi-universal, fit-parameter-free theory for relaxation in thermal molecular liquids over 14 orders of magnitude in time.

	abstract = {In this article, we derive a rate model, the “cooperative free volume” (CFV) model, to explain relaxation dynamics in terms of a system’s free volume, Vfree, and its temperature, T, over widely varied pressure dependent conditions. In the CFV model, the rate a molecule moves a distance on the order of its own size is dependent on the cooperation of surrounding molecules to open up enough free space. To test CFV, we have generated extensive T,V dependent simulation data for structural relaxation times, τ, on a Kob and Andersen type Lennard-Jones (KA-LJ) fluid. The Vfree = V − Vhc values are obtained by estimating the limiting hard core volume, Vhc, through analysis of the KA-LJ PVT data. We provide the first simulation evidence that shows ln τ to be linearly proportional to 1/Vfree on isotherms, with T-dependent slopes, thus confirming our recent analysis of experimental systems. The linear relationship exhibited by the simulation data is further shown to occur at temperatures both above and below the transition to Arrhenius behavior. We also show that the gas kinetic T-dependent contribution is important in simulation results and that there can be a significant entropic contribution from lingering molecular hard-cores at high T. A key result is that non-Arrhenius relaxation behavior is always exhibited on isobars of the KA-LJ fluid, even at high T. The CFV model predicts all of this behavior over a surprisingly wide range of the KA-LJ T,V space, fitting it with just a single set of three parameters. The CFV approach leads to a framework wherein the number of cooperating particles, and thus, the process free energy of activation, is inversely proportional to Vfree, and this is the foundation for the form of the model’s volume contribution, a form that we find to hold for all systems and at all temperatures.},

By employing novel crystal-avoiding simulations, metastable equilibrium dynamics is probed in the absence of complications associated with size polydispersity. Based on a highly accurate structural input from integral equation theory, ECNLE theory is found to describe well the simulated density and temperature dependences of the alpha relaxation time of atomic fluids using a single system-specific parameter, ac, that reflects the nonuniversal relative importance of local cage and collective elastic barriers. For polymer fluids, the explicit dynamical effect of local chain connectivity is modeled at the fundamental dynamic free energy trajectory level based on a different parameter, Nc, that quantifies the degree of intramolecular correlation of bonded segment activated barrier hopping. For the flexible chain model studied, a physically intuitive value of Nc ≈ 2 results in good agreement between simulation and theory. A direct comparison between atomic and polymeric systems reveals that chain connectivity can speed up activated segmental relaxation due to weakening of equilibrium packing correlations but can slow down relaxation due to local bonding constraints. The empirical thermodynamic scaling idea for the alpha time is found to work well at high densities or temperatures but fails when both density and temperature are low. The rich and subtle behaviors revealed from simulation for atomic and polymeric WCA fluids are all well captured by ECNLE theory.},

What controls the sharp slowing down of molecular motion upon approaching the glass transition temperature Tg, whether there is an underlying thermodynamic transition at some finite temperature below Tg, what the role of cooperativity and heterogeneity are, and many other questions continue to be topics of active discussions. This review focuses on the mechanisms that control the steepness of the temperature dependence of structural relaxation (fragility) in glass-forming liquids. We present a brief overview of the basic theoretical models and their experimental tests, analyzing their predictions for fragility and emphasizing the successes and failures of the models. Special attention is focused on the connection of fast dynamics on picosecond time scales to the behavior of structural relaxation on much longer time scales. A separate section discusses the specific case of polymeric glass-forming liquids, which usually have extremely high fragility. We emphasize the apparent difference between the glass transitions in polymers and small molecules. We also discuss the possible role of quantum effects in the glass transition of light molecules and highlight the recent discovery of the unusually low fragility of water. At the end, we formulate the major challenges and questions remaining in this field.},

The analysis of literature data presented here demonstrates that chain rigidity might be the main reason for this peculiar behaviour. Based on this analysis a simple scenario is proposed: (i) oligomers (short polymeric chains) follow trends characteristic for non-polymeric systems; (ii) increase in molecular weight (MW) does not affect structural relaxation significantly in the case of flexible chains; (iii) however, it slows down structural relaxation in rigid chains tremendously. As a result, a strong increase of Tg with MW is observed for rigid polymers. This rise in Tg leads to extremely high ‘apparent’ fragility and failure of usual correlations between the fragility and other parameters in rigid polymers.},

These are: Region I where the asymptotic value of Tg has been reached. Region II where Tg becomes chain length dependent and Region III in which the substance is still in its oligomeric form and Tg is even more chain length dependent.

In glasses, the vanishing of shear rigidity upon increasing temperature is the reverse process of the glass transition. It remains poorly understood due to the disorder leading to nontrivial (nonaffine) components in the atomic displacements. Our theory explains the basic mechanism of the melting transition of amorphous (disordered) solids in terms of the lattice energy lost to this nonaffine motion, compared to which thermal vibrations turn out to play only a negligible role. The theory is in good agreement with classic data on melting of amorphous polymers (for which no alternative theory can be found in the literature) and offers new opportunities in materials science.},

Using the cooperative free volume ({CFV}) rate model, we have linked a faster dynamic response to a lower density (i.e., greater available or free volume) closer to the interface. Experimental and simulation studies have shown that the relaxation profile is significantly broader than the local density profile. Here, we explain this difference using the {CFV} model to show that local relaxation can be enabled through accrual of a fixed amount of free volume, the value of which is a characteristic, material-dependent quantity. The process by which a relaxing segment acquires this volume involves a cooperative region whose length scale will change with density and therefore with distance from the interface. The result is a region-averaged position-dependent density profile that is significantly broadened and that links directly to the relaxation profile. Finally, we explain why these film confinement effects diminish in importance as the temperature is increased.},

The torsional parameters were determined by fitting to rotational energy profiles obtained from ab initio molecular orbital calculations at the {RHF}/6-31G*//{RHF}/6-31G* level for more than 50 organic molecules and ions. The quality of the fits was high with average errors for conformational energies of less than 0.2 kcal/mol. The force-field results for molecular structures are also demonstrated to closely match the ab initio predictions. The nonbonded parameters were developed in conjunction with Monte Carlo statistical mechanics simulations by computing thermodynamic and structural properties for 34 pure organic liquids including alkanes, alkenes, alcohols, ethers, acetals, thiols, sulfides, disulfides, aldehydes, ketones, and amides. Average errors in comparison with experimental data are 2\% for heats of vaporization and densities. The Monte Carlo simulations included sampling all internal and intermolecular degrees of freedom. It is found that such non-polar and monofunctional systems do not show significant condensed-phase effects on internal energies in going from the gas phase to the pure liquids.},

We pursue the consequences of this idea by performing coarse-grained molecular simulations of polymer melts with additives of variable size and interaction strength with the polymer matrix, thereby significantly altering the relaxation of the composite material. Both the string and localization models describe our relaxation time data well, and a comparison of the model parameters allows us to relate the local caging scale ⟨u2⟩ (the Debye-Waller parameter) to the entropy of activation for molecular rearrangements in the string model, thereby developing a bridge between these seemingly disparate approaches to liquid dynamics.},

We find quantitative relations between emergent elasticity, the average local volume accessible for particle motion, and the growth of collective motion in cooled liquids. Surprisingly, we find that each of these models of glass formation can equally well describe the relaxation data for all of the systems that we simulate. In this way, we uncover some unity in our understanding of glass-forming materials from perspectives formerly considered as distinct.},

The magnitude and thermal variations of τ3 reflect changes in the dielectric α-relaxation time τα and its non-Arrhenius or “fragile” characteristics. τ3 also displays striking similarities with the fast relaxations reflected in the hydrogen-weighted mean square atomic displacements ⟨u2⟩. The parallel temperature variations of ⟨u2(T/Tg)⟩, τ3(T/Tg), and τα(T/Tg), and their similar patterns of change between the different glasses, are discussed in terms of anharmonicity in the intermolecular caging potentials and the subnanometer density heterogeneities.},

This behaviour of the fast relaxation is puzzling because the glass transition originates from the structure of the liquid falling out of equilibrium at temperatures where the α-relaxation time becomes long, for example 103 s. In this work, we consider a model proposed for the fast relaxation that is based on an extension of the coupling model to incorporate the dynamics of cage decay. Several properties of the fast relaxation are deduced from the model and shown to be consistent with the experimental data, including the appearance of a break at the glass transition temperature.},

	abstract = {A local segmental mobility was determined by electron spin resonance ({ESR}) spin-label method for a series of polystyrene ({PS}) with various molecular weights. Each {PS} specimen was selectively spin-labeled with stable nitroxide radicals at a chain end or inside sites. Molecular motion at the inside of the chain was compared with that at the chain end from the temperature dependence of {ESR} spectra of the nitroxide radicals. The transition temperature of molecular motion, T5.0mT, at which the extreme separation width due to 14N anisotropic hyperfine splitting is 5.0 {mT}, increased with an increase in molecular weight. The {WLF} equation confirmed that the T5.0mT correlated with a glass transition temperature, Tg, of {PS}. The T5.0mT for the spin-labeled {PS} at the chain end was ca. 5 K lower than that for the spin-labeled {PS} at the inside sites due to the enrichment of the specific free volume around the chain end. The transition temperature, T5.0mT, for both labeled {PS} depended on the molecular weight in accordance with the Unberreiter−Kanig equation for a glass transition. The T5.0mT for the spin-labeled {PS} at the chain end had a strong dependence on the molecular weight as compared with that at the inside sites because the molecular motion of the chain end was accelerated by an encounter of more than two chain ends. From the molecular weight dependence, we determined the short correlation time for segmental motion of the chain end, ca. 40 s, and the segment size undergoing the segmental motion at the Tg. The obtained segment size agreed well with the general segment size reported by others, 5−10 monomeric unit size.},

When experimental data are available, both elements and diatomic compounds (alkali halides, oxides, carbides, {III}-V semiconductors) are considered. The correlations to Tm, Î¸D(T = 0) and a high temperature effective Î¸D are compared. It is found that for all practical purposes Tm gives the best correlation. For diatomic compounds, the average mass is not uniquely defined and various averages are discussed.

Problems at the end of each Chapter provide the reader with the opportunity to apply what has been learned to practice. The book is divided into four parts. After an introduction in Chapter 1, where the necessary concepts from a first course on polymers are summarized, the conformations of single polymer chains are treated in Part 1. Part 2 deals with the thermodynamics of polymer solutions and melts, including the conformations of chains in those states. Part 3 applies the concepts of Part 2 to the formation and properties of polymer networks. Finally, Part 4 explains the essential aspects of how polymers move in both melt and solution states.

	shorttitle = {Universal localization transition accompanying glass formation},
	abstract = {The origin of the precipitous dynamic arrest known as the glass transition is a grand open question of soft condensed matter physics. It has long been suspected that this transition is driven by an onset of particle localization and associated emergence of a glassy modulus. However, progress towards an accepted understanding of glass formation has been impeded by an inability to obtain data sufficient in chemical diversity, relaxation timescales, and spatial and temporal resolution to validate or falsify proposed theories for its physics. Here we first describe a strategy enabling facile high-throughput simulation of glass-forming liquids to nearly unprecedented relaxation times. We then perform simulations of 51 glass-forming liquids, spanning polymers, small organic molecules, inorganics, and metallic glass-formers, with longest relaxation times exceeding one microsecond. Results identify a universal particle-localization transition accompanying glass formation across all classes of glass-forming liquid. The onset temperature of non-Arrhenius dynamics is found to serve as a normalizing condition leading to a master collapse of localization data. This transition exhibits a non-universal relationship with dynamic arrest, suggesting that the nonuniversality of supercooled liquid dynamics enters via the dependence of relaxation times on local cage scale. These results suggest that a universal particle-localization transition may underpin the glass transition, and they emphasize the potential for recent theoretical developments connecting relaxation to localization and emergent elasticity to finally explain the origin of this phenomenon. More broadly, the capacity for high-throughput prediction of glass formation behavior may open the door to computational inverse design of glass-forming materials.},

	abstract = {Since the classical molecular dynamics simulator {LAMMPS} was released as an open source code in 2004, it has become a widely-used tool for particle-based modeling of materials at length scales ranging from atomic to mesoscale to continuum. Reasons for its popularity are that it provides a wide variety of particle interaction models for different materials, that it runs on any platform from a single {CPU} core to the largest supercomputers with accelerators, and that it gives users control over simulation details, either via the input script or by adding code for new interatomic potentials, constraints, diagnostics, or other features needed for their models. As a result, hundreds of people have contributed new capabilities to {LAMMPS} and it has grown from fifty thousand lines of code in 2004 to a million lines today. In this paper several of the fundamental algorithms used in {LAMMPS} are described along with the design strategies which have made it flexible for both users and developers. We also highlight some capabilities recently added to the code which were enabled by this flexibility, including dynamic load balancing, on-the-fly visualization, magnetic spin dynamics models, and quantum-accuracy machine learning interatomic potentials.

Program Title: Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator ({LAMMPS}) {CPC} Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/cxbxs9btsv.1 Developer's repository link: https://github.com/lammps/lammps Licensing provisions: {GPLv}2 Programming language: C++, Python, C, Fortran Supplementary material: https://www.lammps.org Nature of problem: Many science applications in physics, chemistry, materials science, and related fields require parallel, scalable, and efficient generation of long, stable classical particle dynamics trajectories. Within this common problem definition, there lies a great diversity of use cases, distinguished by different particle interaction models, external constraints, as well as timescales and lengthscales ranging from atomic to mesoscale to macroscopic. Solution method: The {LAMMPS} code uses parallel spatial decomposition, distributed neighbor lists, and parallel {FFTs} for long-range Coulombic interactions [1]. The time integration algorithm is based on the Størmer-Verlet symplectic integrator [2], which provides better stability than higher-order non-symplectic methods. In addition, {LAMMPS} supports a wide range of interatomic potentials, constraints, diagnostics, software interfaces, and pre- and post-processing features. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: This paper serves as the definitive reference for the {LAMMPS} code.

	abstract = {We generalize the force-level Elastically Collective Nonlinear Langevin Equation theory of supercooled molecular liquid dynamics to polymer melts based on mapping chains to disconnected and noninterpenetrating Kuhn-sized spheres. This allows first-principles, no adjustable parameter calculations to be performed for the temperature-dependent mean segmental relaxation time of chemically diverse van der Waals polymers over a wide range of molecular weights. Despite the simplicity of the mapping, the theory does a good job of a priori predicting the glass transition temperature (Tg), the dynamic fragility, and full temperature dependence of the α-relaxation time for some high molecular weight polymers and the chain length dependence of Tg as the consequence of the molecular weight dependence of backbone stiffness. The minimalist model does not capture the unusually low and high fragilities of certain long chain polymers which are not typical of van der Waals molecular liquids. This seems likely due to the simple coarse graining adopted which ignores longer range chain connectivity and nonuniversal factors on the sub-Kuhn length scale. Elasticity, not of an entropic single chain origin, emerges in deeply supercooled polymer liquids due to transient segmental localization and is studied at the microscopic stress-tensor level. Calculations of the frequency-dependent dynamic storage modulus close to Tg appear to be qualitatively consistent with recent measurements.},

	abstract = {It is shown that the glass transition temperature Tg of molecular (non-polymeric) glass formers correlates with molecular mass M as Tg(M) f Ma, a ¼ 0.51 Æ 0.02. The subclasses of molecular glasses with homologous chemical structure but different M exhibit a similar universal correlation with signiﬁcantly lower scatter. A possible explanation of Tg vs M correlation in molecular glasses is suggested. Comparing molecular glasses with polymers we found that in polymers Tg(M) dependence at small M (short chains) is similar to that in molecular glasses. At further increasing of the chain length the Tg(M) dependence in polymers begin to deviate from the universal Tg(M) correlation of molecular glasses and eventually saturates at some polymer speciﬁc {TgN} value. We conclude that at least a substantial part of Tg(M) dependence of low-M polymers is common with molecular glasses mechanism that does not require chain-like structure. In particular, the model of Tg(M) dependence in polymers based on additional free volume on chain ends is not fully adequate at small M. Our picture provides an alternative explanation that in polymers a mechanism is in action which leads to a saturation of the normal Tg(M) dependence common with molecular glasses.},

	abstract = {Using varying proportions and different combinations of polystyrene fractions with degrees of polymerization 928, 222, 48, 39, 8, 3.3, and 2, twelve mixtures of widely varying composition were prepared. The same conclusions could be drawn from the volume-temperature curves of these mixtures as were drawn from the data for pure fractions in an earlier paper. Regarding the thermal expansion coefficients (dv/{dT})liq. and (dv/{dT})sol. and the specific volumes above the transition temperature υliq., the mixtures behave as ideal mixtures composed of chain end and middle groups. The end groups act as plasticizers and cause the “self-plasticization” of the polymer. From the fact of an “iso-oscillation volume” at the transition temperature, a relationship between second-order transition temperature, Tg, and the mole fraction of the end groups, Ne, was derived. An explanation is given for the statements of Alexandrov and Lazurkin that high polymers plasticized by their monomers show softening temperatures which are independent of the molecular weight of the high polymer and depend only on the percentage of monomer.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have shown that the method of hydrogen mass repartitioning (HMR) is a potentially useful tool for accelerating molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. By repartitioning the mass of heavy atoms into the bonded hydrogen atoms, it is possible to slow the highest-frequency motions of the macromolecule under study, thus allowing the time step of the simulation to be increased by up to a factor of 2. In this communication, we investigate further how this mass repartitioning allows the simulation time step to be increased in a stable fashion without signiﬁcantly increasing discretization error. To this end, we ran a set of simulations with diﬀerent time steps and mass distributions on a three-residue peptide to get a comprehensive view of the eﬀect of mass repartitioning and time step increase on a system whose accessible phase space is fully explored in a relatively short amount of time. We next studied a 129-residue protein, hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL), to verify that the observed behavior extends to a larger, more-realistic, system. Results for the protein include structural comparisons from MD trajectories, as well as comparisons of pKa calculations via constant-pH MD. We also calculated a potential of mean force (PMF) of a dihedral rotation for the MTS [(1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-pyrroline-3-methyl)methanethiosulfonate] spin label via umbrella sampling with a set of regular MD trajectories, as well as a set of mass-repartitioned trajectories with a time step of 4 fs. Since no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in kinetics or thermodynamics is observed by the use of fast HMR trajectories, further evidence is provided that long-time-step HMR MD simulations are a viable tool for accelerating MD simulations for molecules of biochemical interest.},

Unfortunately, existing viscosity models, such as the Vogel–Fulcher–Tammann ({VFT}) and Avramov–Milchev ({AM}) equations, exhibit systematic error when extrapolating to low temperatures. We present a model offering an improved description of the viscosity–temperature relationship for both inorganic and organic liquids using the same number of parameters as {VFT} and {AM}. The model has a clear physical foundation based on the temperature dependence of configurational entropy, and it offers an accurate prediction of low-temperature isokoms without any singularity at finite temperature. Our results cast doubt on the existence of a Kauzmann entropy catastrophe and associated ideal glass transition.},

	abstract = {We analyze the temperature dependence of the segmental relaxation time τ of several low-Tg polymers with varying molar masses (M) as obtained from ﬁeld-cycling 1H {NMR} relaxometry and dielectric spectroscopy. They are compared with those of molecular liquids ({ML}). Time constants in the range 3 × 10−12 s−1000 s, i.e., between Tg and 413 K, are covered. Describing τ(T) by the Vogel−Fulcher−Tammann ({VFT}) eq a systematic diﬀerence with respect to {ML} is found. While {VFT} fails for the latter it works well for polymers. The apparent activation energy at high temperatures shows a trend toward a temperature independent value E∞. For polymers, its Mdependence follows that of Tg(M), thus E∞(M) can be described by a Fox−Flory equation. Attempting to understand the diﬀerence among the two classes of liquids, we take recourse to our approach ﬁrst applied to {ML} [J. Chem. Phys. 2013, 139, 084504]; i.e., we decompose the temperature-dependent activation energy E(T) controlling τ(T) in a constant high-temperature value E∞(M) and a “cooperative part” Ecoop(T). The latter turns out to depend exponentially on temperature, as in {ML}. Introducing a plot in terms of Ecoop(T)/E∞ vs T/E∞, a master curve for each polymer series is revealed. Taking averaged parameters for all polymers a three-parameter ﬁt well interpolates τ(T) up to highest temperatures. Describing molecular and polymer liquids within the same approach, the diﬀerence lies in the fact that the ratio E∞/Ecoop(Tg) is systematically higher for polymers; i.e., τ(T) displays an Arrhenius behavior extending over a larger temperature range.},

Here, we bridge this gap via a model-based forecasting approach. We assess models of the temperature dependence of dynamics in glass forming liquids based upon the rate at which their prediction of Tg and fragility converge upon incorporating increasingly long timescale data. We find that the Cooperative Model of Schmidtke et al. typically provides the best predictions, ultimately enabling good Tg predictions from all-atom simulations of a range of polymers. Together with a protocol for efficient simulation of dynamics in glass-forming liquids, this strategy enables high-throughput computational screening of the glass transition. The success of the Cooperative Model in predicting low temperature behavior adds support to the two-barrier scenario underlying this model.},

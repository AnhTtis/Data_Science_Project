\section*{Quantifying Relaxation and its Dependence on Temperature}

\subsection*{Defining Relaxation Times}
\label{choose_tg}

We report here the time evolution of the self-part of the intermediate scattering function, $F_s$, for a chain length of 
$N=10$ and each model studied:
the freely-jointed chain (FJC),
the freely-rotating chain (FRC),
and all-atom polystyrene (AAPS).
We also report for AAPS when $N=100$.
Temperatures are indicated in the legend for each; 
the red data indicate the highest temperature simulated, 
and the blue data indicate our coldest equilibrated temperature.
The data here is only a subset of all temperatures simulated and equilibrated for clarity\footnote{Simulation protocol elaborated further in Hung et al., Soft Matter, 2019, 15, 1223}.
Filled symbols are the mean system;
open symbols are that of the chain ends.

\section*{The Debye-Waller Factor and its Dependence on $T$}
\subsection*{Definition of Debye-Waller Factor}

As in prior work \cite{hung_universal_2019},
we here define the Debye-Waller factor $\langle u^2 \rangle$ near the cage onset time for the models studied here;
specifically, 
we choose the mean-square displacement at a time delta of 0.275 (or $\approx 10^{-0.55}$) dimensionless time units for both the FJC and FRC and 
0.711 ps (or $\approx 10^{-0.15}$ ps) for AAPS.
These timescale choices are shown below as vertical black lines in Figures \ref{fig:msd_fjc_10}-\ref{fig:msd_ps_100}
(wherein the temperatures are the same as in Figures \ref{fig:isfs_fjc_10}-\ref{fig:isfs_ps_100}).

\subsection*{Dependence of Debye-Waller Factor on Temperature}

Overall (see Figures \ref{fig:dwf_fjc}-\ref{fig:dwf_ps_100} below),
$\langle u^2 \rangle$ is linear with respect to temperature (as expected; see \cite{hung_universal_2019}).
To compare across chain lengths,
we choose a temperature for each model that is at worst 
(for the longest chains, which demonstrate the highest $T_g$ values) 
a slight extrapolation for any given chain length.
We then utilize the line-of-best-fit of $\langle u^2 \rangle$ vs temperature to evaluate $\langle u^2 \rangle$ for that specific temperature for each model: 0.4 for the FJC, 0.6 for the FRC, and 500 K for AAPS.
These resulting values are reported in Figure 3 of the main text.

\section*{Model Details}
We present data for three models to span from a fully-flexible bead-spring chain to a chemically realistic polymer.
All simulations are performed in LAMMPS \cite{thompson_lammps_2022}.
The simplest model, the freely-jointed chain (FJC), 
uses the standard finite extensible nonlinear elastic (FENE) bond potential
\cite{kremer_dynamics_1990},
$$E = -0.5 K R_0^2  \ln \left[ 1 - \left(\frac{r}{R_0}\right)^2\right] + 4 \epsilon \left[ \left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^{12} - \left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^6 \right] + \epsilon,$$
with particle size $\sigma=1$,
interaction strength $\epsilon=1$,
FENE elastic constant $K=30$, and
maximum bond elongation $R_0 = 1.5$.
To increase chain stiffness, we employ an angle potential to model a freely-rotating chain (FRC),
$$
E = K_\theta [\cos(\theta) - \cos(\theta_0)]^2.
$$
We set the bending constant $K_\theta=25$ and bending equilibrium angle $\cos\theta_0 = -0.333$ (which corresponds to 109.5 degrees), as done in prior work
\cite{bulacu_molecular-dynamics_2007}.
Bead-spring Simulations utilize the Stoermer-Verlet time integration algorithm as implemented in LAMMPS with a time\-step of $\tau = 0.005$.
Both the FJC and FRC span chain lengths of $4 \le N \le 60$ beads with total bead counts of $N = 30000$.
The simulation protocol (PreSQ) is the same as used in prior work \cite{hung_universal_2019,hung_forecasting_2020}:
simulations begin with a high temperature anneal before sequential linear quenches and further iso\-thermal annealing sufficient to yield equilibrium relaxation times. These simulations are performed in the iso\-thermal-isobaric (npt) ensemble using the Nose-Hoover thermostat and baro\-stat, with both damping parameters set to $\tau=2$.

To analyze a model with realistic chemical structure, we perform additional analysis of OPLS all-atom polystyrene (AAPS) simulations published in prior work
\cite{hung_universal_2019,hung_forecasting_2020}. 
Full details of those simulations can be found in those prior publications. 
 AAPS degrees of polymerization range from $3 \le N \le 400$ chemical repeat units, with a total chemical repeat unit count per simulation of approximately 800, e.g., for $N=5$ there are 160 chains and for $N=400$ there are two chains.

\section{}
Upon obtaining these relaxation time and temperature pairs,
$T_g$ is then quantified by fitting to the MYEGA functional form suggested by Mauro et al. \cite{mauro_viscosity_2009}, which may be written as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:myega}
\log{\tau} = \log{\tau_\infty} + \frac{A}{T}\exp{\frac{B}{T}}.
\end{equation}

We rewrite this self-consistently in terms of the glass transition temperature, as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:myega_tg}
\log{\tau} = \log{\tau_\infty} 
+ \left(\log\tau_{g} - \log{\tau_\infty}\right) 
\frac{T_g}{T} 
\exp{\left(B
\left(\frac{1}{T} - \frac{1}{T_g}\right)
\right)}
\end{equation}
in order to conveniently obtain standard errors on $T_g$ from a least-squares regression upon choosing a timescale $\tau_g$ for $T_g$.
We define $T_g$ at an extrapolated experimental timescale of 100 seconds for AAPS, to allow for experimental comparability
(this comparison has been validated in prior work \cite{hung_forecasting_2020}). 
For the FJC and FRC, we instead employ a computational timescale $T_g$ convention of $\tau_g = 10^{4}$ dimensionless Lennard-Jones time units, as is standard for bead models
\cite{marvin_nanoconfinement_2014,hsu_glass-transition_2016,cheng_design_2018}.
This process is used for both mean system (cf. Figure 1, filled markers) and repeat unit specific (cf. Figure 1, crosses and open markers, and Figure 2, all markers) analysis.

Consistent with in prior work
\cite{hung_universal_2019,hung_forecasting_2020}
we quantify relaxation via the self-part of the intermediate scattering function,
using a wave\-number near the first peak in the structure factor:
7.07196/$\sigma_{LJ}$ (where $\sigma_{LJ}$ is the Lennard Jones unit of length and is of order 1 nm in real units) for both the freely-jointed and freely-rotation chain models and 1.19952/\AA \ for the all-atom polystyrene model. Below, we show representative self-intermediate scattering function data vs time for each model with a chain length of $N=10$ for all models, with the addition of $N=100$ for AAPS,
plotting both the mean system data and chain end data 
(cf. Figure 1 of the main letter).
The slow relaxation process within these relaxation functions is then fit to a stretched exponential and the alpha relaxation time is defined as the time at which this function decays to 0.2,
as done in several prior works \cite{hanakata_local_2012,lang_combined_2014,hung_heterogeneous_2018}.

\section*{Derivation of Generic Two-Barrier $T_g$ Model}

Consider a generic two-barrier model wherein the total activation barrier $F_{tot}^{mid}$ in the mid-chain is the sum of a local barrier $F_{loc}^{mid}$ and a collective barrier $F_{coll}^{mid}$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:midF}
F_{tot}^{mid}\left( N,T \right)=F_{loc}^{mid}\left( N,T \right)+F_{coll}^{mid}\left( N,T \right).
\end{equation}
Alterations of this barrier at the chain end are rooted in alterations to intra\-molecular correlations that are intrinsically present arbitrarily far above $T_g$, and therefore most directly impact the local barrier (since the collective barrier is absent far above $T_g$). 
We thus model the end effect as a fractional reduction of the local barrier by a factor $\alpha^{end}$, which we model as roughly temperature-invariant (but expect to be chemistry dependent and larger for stiffer chains) since it reflects a truncation of intra\-molecular barriers that are mainly ster\-ic and bonding in nature and therefore relatively a\-thermal:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:endF}
F_{tot}^{end}\left( N,T \right)={{\alpha }^{end}}F_{loc}^{mid}\left( N,T \right)+F_{coll}^{mid}\left( N,T \right).
\end{equation}

One can quantify the expected temperature dependence of the chain-end relaxation time gradient within this perspective by employing the total barrier forms above within a generalized activation law to compute the ratio of chain-end to chain-mid relaxation times:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:tauratio}
\log \left( \frac{{{\tau }_{end}}\left( N,T \right)}{{{\tau }_{mid}}\left( N,T \right)} \right)=\frac{\left( 1-{{\alpha }^{end}} \right){{F}_{loc}^{mid}}\left( N,T \right)}{kT}.
\end{equation}
This equation anticipates that the enhanced chain end mobility (relative to the mid-chain) should grow on cooling, as discussed in the main text, simply because of the reduction in temperature and any growth on cooling of $F_{loc}^{mid}$.

We can further combine Equations \ref{eq:midF} and \ref{eq:endF} with a generalized activation law as above, rearrange them to solve for temperature, apply each at its corresponding local $T_g$,
%(end or mid), 
and take their ratio. This gives
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Tgrad}
\frac{T_{g}^{end}}{T_{g}^{mid}}=R\left[ 1-\left( 1-{{\alpha }^{end}} \right)x_{loc}^{mid}\left( N,T_{g}^{end} \right) \right],
\end{equation}
where 
$R={F_{tot}^{mid}\left( N,T_{g}^{end} \right)}/{F_{tot}^{mid}\left( N,T_{g}^{mid} \right)},\;$ 
and
$x_{loc}^{mid}={F_{loc}^{mid}\left( N,T_{g}^{end} \right)}/{F_{tot}^{mid}\left( N,T_{g}^{end} \right)}\;$
is the fraction of the total barrier in the mid-chain that is contributed by the local barrier. 
For a weak $T_{g}$ end effect as we observe, we can approximate the relaxation process as Arrhenius over the limited temperature range involved, giving $R\approx1$. 
%Consistent with the results in Figure \ref{fig:timescale}, 
Equation \ref{eq:Tgrad} then predicts that the $T_g$ end effect shrinks on cooling, even as the $\tau$ end effect grows, because the fractional reduction from the local barrier $x_{loc}^{mid}$ shrinks on cooling such that the end effects become diluted within the faster-growing overall barrier. 

\section*{Determination of High-Temperature Activation Energies}

While we choose to fit relaxation data and thus define $T_g$ using the functional form from Mauro et al. \cite{mauro_viscosity_2009},
as discussed above in \textbf{\nameref{choose_tg}},
the functional form proposed by Schmidtke et al. \cite{schmidtke_temperature_2015},
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:coop}
\log{\tau} = \log{\tau_\infty} + 
\frac{E_\infty}{T} \left( 1 + \exp{ 
\left( -\mu \left( \frac{T}{E_\infty} -b \right) \right)
} \right),  
\end{equation}
with its additional fit parameter analytically recovers Arrhenius behavior in the high temperature limit.
As such, we utilize this form to robustly define high temperature activation energies.
Specifically,
we perform lines-of-best-fit to the relaxation data shown in Figures 
\ref{fig:relax_fjc}-\ref{fig:relax_ps}
and plot the slopes as a function of the width of the domain fitted,
shown below in Figures
\ref{fig:fjc_ea}-\ref{fig:ps_ea}.
In the high temperature limit, Arrhenius behavior should be recovered:
the slope $s \equiv \frac{d \log \tau}{d (1/T)}$ should plateau to the limiting value of $E_\infty$ as $\Delta (1/T) \rightarrow 0$.
We note that as this study focuses on $T_g$,
high temperature data is sparse and not the focus of this work.
Nevertheless,
we can fit the analytical derivative of Equation \ref{eq:coop},
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:d-coop}
s = E_\infty 
\left(
1 + 
\left(\frac{\mu}{E_\infty} T + 1\right)
\exp{\left( \mu b - \frac{\mu}{E_\infty} T \right)}
\right),  
\end{equation}
to the data in order to extract a high temperature plateau value from the data.
We further note that longer chain lengths typically have less high temperature data,
resulting in fit values that are systematically higher,
but we expect this does not dominate the trend shown in Figure 4 from the main letter.
In particular: 
the trend is strong and largely monotonic;
three smallest chain lengths for AAPS (Figure \ref{fig:ps_ea}) have high confidence in plateau values;
and the trend is reported experimentally by Schmidtke et al. \cite{schmidtke_temperature_2015} 
(cf. polymers poly(butadiene) (PI) and poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) in Figures 1 and 4).
Finally,
due to the ambiguity of the $\infty$ symbol as representing
either Arrhenius slope 
(as in Equations \ref{eq:coop} and \ref{eq:d-coop}) 
or 
the infinite molecular weight limit 
(such as how $T_{g,\infty}$ denotes $T_g$ for an infinite molecular weight polymer),
for the main letter and in particular Figure 4,
we use $E_a$ (instead of $E_\infty$ as shown above, which is consistent with \cite{schmidtke_temperature_2015}) to denote the high temperature activation energy
(viz., slope)
and $E_{a,\infty}$ to denote this value for the infinite molecular weight limit.

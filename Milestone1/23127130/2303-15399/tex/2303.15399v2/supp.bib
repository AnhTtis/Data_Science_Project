	abstract = {Since the classical molecular dynamics simulator {LAMMPS} was released as an open source code in 2004, it has become a widely-used tool for particle-based modeling of materials at length scales ranging from atomic to mesoscale to continuum. Reasons for its popularity are that it provides a wide variety of particle interaction models for different materials, that it runs on any platform from a single {CPU} core to the largest supercomputers with accelerators, and that it gives users control over simulation details, either via the input script or by adding code for new interatomic potentials, constraints, diagnostics, or other features needed for their models. As a result, hundreds of people have contributed new capabilities to {LAMMPS} and it has grown from fifty thousand lines of code in 2004 to a million lines today. In this paper several of the fundamental algorithms used in {LAMMPS} are described along with the design strategies which have made it flexible for both users and developers. We also highlight some capabilities recently added to the code which were enabled by this flexibility, including dynamic load balancing, on-the-fly visualization, magnetic spin dynamics models, and quantum-accuracy machine learning interatomic potentials.
Program Summary
Program Title: Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator ({LAMMPS}) {CPC} Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/cxbxs9btsv.1 Developer's repository link: https://github.com/lammps/lammps Licensing provisions: {GPLv}2 Programming language: C++, Python, C, Fortran Supplementary material: https://www.lammps.org Nature of problem: Many science applications in physics, chemistry, materials science, and related fields require parallel, scalable, and efficient generation of long, stable classical particle dynamics trajectories. Within this common problem definition, there lies a great diversity of use cases, distinguished by different particle interaction models, external constraints, as well as timescales and lengthscales ranging from atomic to mesoscale to macroscopic. Solution method: The {LAMMPS} code uses parallel spatial decomposition, distributed neighbor lists, and parallel {FFTs} for long-range Coulombic interactions [1]. The time integration algorithm is based on the Størmer-Verlet symplectic integrator [2], which provides better stability than higher-order non-symplectic methods. In addition, {LAMMPS} supports a wide range of interatomic potentials, constraints, diagnostics, software interfaces, and pre- and post-processing features. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: This paper serves as the definitive reference for the {LAMMPS} code.

	abstract = {Polymeric ionic liquids ({PILs}) are of considerable interest as next-generation battery materials due to their potential to combine the solid-state stability of polymers with the high ion conductivities of ionic liquids. However, polymerization of ionic liquids to form a polymer generally leads to a suppression in ion transport rates that has proven to be a major barrier to the realization of commercially viable {PIL} solid electrolytes. Here we employ a combination of all atom and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to identify strategies by which ion conductivity can be maximized by maximizing both {PIL} segmental relaxation rates and the extent of ion transport decoupling from chain dynamics. Results indicate that combined ion size correlates well with {PIL} glass transition temperatures and segmental dynamics but that ion/polymer decoupling is controlled primarily by the size of the free ion. We also find that ion aggregation promotes both reduced glass transition temperatures and enhanced ion/polymer decoupling. These results suggest that {PIL} ion mobility can be improved by combining ultralarge bound ions with very small free ions and with chemistries that promote ion aggregation.},

	abstract = {Despite having very similar bulk properties such as glass-transition temperature (Tg), density, and fragility, polystyrene ({PS}) and poly(methyl methacrylate) ({PMMA}) exhibit characteristically different Tg depression in free-standing ultrathin films due to free surface effects. Here we explain this difference using our recently established chemistry-specific coarse-grained ({CG}) models for these two polymers. Models capture the dissimilar scaling of Tg with free-standing film thickness as seen in experiments and enable us to quantify the size of the regions near free surfaces over which chain relaxation exhibits differences from bulk. Most interestingly, vibrational density of states ({VDOS}) analysis uncovers a relationship between the amplitude of side-chain fluctuations, associated with side-chain flexibility and Tg-nanoconfinement. We discover that increasing backbone to side-chain mass ratio in {CG} models increases the amplitude of side-chain fluctuations and suppresses the free-surface effect on Tg. We show that mass distribution and side-chain flexibility are central to explain dissimilar free surface effects on {PS} and {PMMA}. Our model predictions are further corroborated by experimental evidence showing the role of mass distribution in styrene thin films. Our study ascertains the significance of molecular characteristics on nanoconfinement and highlights the ability for chemistry-specific {CG} models to explore the thermomechanical properties of polymer thin films.},

	abstract = {It has been known for 50 years that polymers exhibit chain normal mode decoupling upon approach to the glass transition, with chain dynamics exhibiting a weaker temperature dependence than segmental dynamics. Inspired by Sokolov and Schweizer’s suggestion that this thermorheological complexity is a consequence of dynamic heterogeneity in the supercooled state, we generalize the Rouse model to account for a distribution of segmental mobilities. The heterogeneous Rouse model ({HRM}) predicts chain translational normal mode decoupling as a manifestation of diffusion/relaxation decoupling (Stokes–Einstein breakdown)—a consequence of differences in how normal modes average over a distribution of segmental mobilities. Molecular dynamics simulations agree with theoretical predictions, with the {HRM} found to quantitatively predict deviations from Rouse scaling of the translational friction coefficient based on the observed degree of Stokes–Einstein breakdown.},

Results indicate that nanoconfined Tg depends linearly on interfacial adhesion energy, with a slope that scales exponentially with the ratio of the bulk Debye?Waller factors ?u2? of the confined and confining materials. These trends, together with a convergence at low interfacial adhesion energy to the Tg of an equivalent freestanding film, are captured in a single functional form, with only three parameters explicitly referring to the confined state. The observed dependence on ?u2? indicates that softness of nanoconfinement should be defined in terms of the relative high frequency shear moduli, rather than low frequency moduli or relaxation times, of the confined and confining materials.},

The effect of film thickness h on the glass transition temperature Tg has been widely examined, but this characterization does not account for the fragility of glass-formation, which quantifies how rapidly relaxation times vary with temperature T. Accordingly, we simulate supported polymer films of a bead-spring model and determine both Tg and fragility, both as a function of h and film depth. We contrast changes in the relaxation dynamics with density ρ and demonstrate the limitations of the commonly invoked free-volume layer model. As opposed to bulk polymer materials, we find that the fragility and Tg do not generally vary proportionately. Consequently, the determination of the fragility profile—both locally and for the film as a whole—is essential for the characterization of changes in film dynamics with confinement.},

They are compared with those of molecular liquids ({ML}). Time constants in the range 3 × 10−12 s−1000 s, i.e., between Tg and 413 K, are covered. Describing τ(T) by the Vogel−Fulcher−Tammann ({VFT}) eq a systematic diﬀerence with respect to {ML} is found. While {VFT} fails for the latter it works well for polymers. The apparent activation energy at high temperatures shows a trend toward a temperature independent value E∞. For polymers, its Mdependence follows that of Tg(M), thus E∞(M) can be described by a Fox−Flory equation. Attempting to understand the diﬀerence among the two classes of liquids, we take recourse to our approach ﬁrst applied to {ML} [J. Chem. Phys. 2013, 139, 084504]; i.e., we decompose the temperature-dependent activation energy E(T) controlling τ(T) in a constant high-temperature value E∞(M) and a “cooperative part” Ecoop(T). The latter turns out to depend exponentially on temperature, as in {ML}. Introducing a plot in terms of Ecoop(T)/E∞ vs T/E∞, a master curve for each polymer series is revealed. Taking averaged parameters for all polymers a three-parameter ﬁt well interpolates τ(T) up to highest temperatures. Describing molecular and polymer liquids within the same approach, the diﬀerence lies in the fact that the ratio E∞/Ecoop(Tg) is systematically higher for polymers; i.e., τ(T) displays an Arrhenius behavior extending over a larger temperature range.},

We present a model offering an improved description of the viscosity–temperature relationship for both inorganic and organic liquids using the same number of parameters as {VFT} and {AM}. The model has a clear physical foundation based on the temperature dependence of configurational entropy, and it offers an accurate prediction of low-temperature isokoms without any singularity at finite temperature.

	abstract = {Previous studies have shown that the method of hydrogen mass repartitioning ({HMR}) is a potentially useful tool for accelerating molecular dynamics ({MD}) simulations. By repartitioning the mass of heavy atoms into the bonded hydrogen atoms, it is possible to slow the highest-frequency motions of the macromolecule under study, thus allowing the time step of the simulation to be increased by up to a factor of 2. In this communication, we investigate further how this mass repartitioning allows the simulation time step to be increased in a stable fashion without signiﬁcantly increasing discretization error. To this end, we ran a set of simulations with diﬀerent time steps and mass distributions on a three-residue peptide to get a comprehensive view of the eﬀect of mass repartitioning and time step increase on a system whose accessible phase space is fully explored in a relatively short amount of time. We next studied a 129-residue protein, hen egg white lysozyme ({HEWL}), to verify that the observed behavior extends to a larger, more-realistic, system. Results for the protein include structural comparisons from {MD} trajectories, as well as comparisons of {pKa} calculations via constant-{pH} {MD}. We also calculated a potential of mean force ({PMF}) of a dihedral rotation for the {MTS} [(1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-pyrroline-3-methyl)methanethiosulfonate] spin label via umbrella sampling with a set of regular {MD} trajectories, as well as a set of mass-repartitioned trajectories with a time step of 4 fs. Since no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in kinetics or thermodynamics is observed by the use of fast {HMR} trajectories, further evidence is provided that long-time-step {HMR} {MD} simulations are a viable tool for accelerating {MD} simulations for molecules of biochemical interest.},

We find that the Cooperative Model of Schmidtke et al. typically provides the best predictions, ultimately enabling good Tg predictions from all-atom simulations of a range of polymers. Together with a protocol for efficient simulation of dynamics in glass-forming liquids, this strategy enables high-throughput computational screening of the glass transition.

	shorttitle = {Universal localization transition accompanying glass formation},
	abstract = {The origin of the precipitous dynamic arrest known as the glass transition is a grand open question of soft condensed matter physics. It has long been suspected that this transition is driven by an onset of particle localization and associated emergence of a glassy modulus. However, progress towards an accepted understanding of glass formation has been impeded by an inability to obtain data sufficient in chemical diversity, relaxation timescales, and spatial and temporal resolution to validate or falsify proposed theories for its physics. Here we first describe a strategy enabling facile high-throughput simulation of glass-forming liquids to nearly unprecedented relaxation times. We then perform simulations of 51 glass-forming liquids, spanning polymers, small organic molecules, inorganics, and metallic glass-formers, with longest relaxation times exceeding one microsecond. Results identify a universal particle-localization transition accompanying glass formation across all classes of glass-forming liquid. The onset temperature of non-Arrhenius dynamics is found to serve as a normalizing condition leading to a master collapse of localization data. This transition exhibits a non-universal relationship with dynamic arrest, suggesting that the nonuniversality of supercooled liquid dynamics enters via the dependence of relaxation times on local cage scale. These results suggest that a universal particle-localization transition may underpin the glass transition, and they emphasize the potential for recent theoretical developments connecting relaxation to localization and emergent elasticity to finally explain the origin of this phenomenon. More broadly, the capacity for high-throughput prediction of glass formation behavior may open the door to computational inverse design of glass-forming materials.},

    "abstract": "The immense dependence of the glass transition temperature Tg on molecular weight M is one of the most fundamentally and practically important features of polymer glass formation. Here, we report on molecular dynamics simulation of multiple multiple model polymers demonstrating that the 70-year-old canonical explanation of this dependence - a simple chain end dilution effect - is likely incorrect at leading order. Instead, end effects, present only in relatively stiff polymers, become less significant on cooling, and Tg(M) trends are dominated by whole-chain shifts in Tg rather than an end effect. These findings are more consistent with two-barrier models of Tg and its M-dependence, suggesting a need to reassess the canonical understanding of this dependence and an opportunity to reveal new glass formation physics via renewed study of this trend.",

    "abstract": "The bricks over preprojective algebras of type A are known to be in bijection with certain combinatorial objects called \"arcs\". In this paper, we show how one can use arcs to compute bases for the Hom-spaces and first extension spaces between bricks. We then use this description to classify the \"weak exceptional sequences\" over these algebras. Finally, we explain how our result relates to a similar combinatorial model for the exceptional sequences over hereditary algebras of type A.",

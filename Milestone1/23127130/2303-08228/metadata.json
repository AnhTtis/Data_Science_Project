    "abstract": "It is generally accepted that it is preferable to build two general purpose detectors at any given collider facility. We reinforce this point by discussing a number of aspects and particular instances in which this has been important. The examples are taken mainly, but not exclusively, from experience at the Tevatron collider.",

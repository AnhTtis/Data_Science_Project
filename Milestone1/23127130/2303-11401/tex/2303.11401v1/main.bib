abstract = {A new type of solution of the London equation for type-{II} superconductors is obtained to describe the ring-shaped (toroidal) Abrikosov vortices. The specific feature of these solutions is the self-consistent localization of both the supercurrent and the magnetic field, enabling one to construct compact magnetic structures inside a superconductor. The torus vortex contraction caused by the vortex instability leads to the destruction of the Cooper pairing and the formation of a normal electron stream in the vicinity of the torus axis. The thermodynamic condition for the excitation of a small closed vortex by a bunch of charged particles contains the fine-structure constant as a determining parameter.}

    "abstract": "A celebrated result of Gromov ensures the existence of a contact structure on any connected non-compact odd dimensional Lie group. In general, such structures are not invariant under left translation. The problem of finding which Lie groups admit a left-invariant contact structure (contact Lie groups) resolves to the question of determining when a Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is contact; that is, admits a one-form $\\varphi\\in\\mathfrak{g}^*$ such that $\\varphi\\wedge(d\\varphi)^k\\neq 0.$\n  In full generality, this remains an open question; however we settle it for the important category of the evocatively named \\textit {seaweed algebras} by showing that an index-one seaweed is contact precisely when it is quasi-reductive. Seaweeds were introduced by Dergachev and Kirillov who initiated the development of their index theory -- since completed by Joseph, Panyushev, Yakimova, and Coll, among others. Recall that a contact Lie algebra has index one -- but not characteristically so. Leveraging recent work of Duflo, Khalgui, Torasso, Panyushev, Yakimova, and Ammari, who collectively classified quasi-reductive seaweeds, our equivalence yields a full classification of contact seaweeds. We remark that since type-A and type-C seaweeds are de facto quasi-reductive (by a result of Panyushev), in these types index one alone suffices to ensure the existence of a contact form.",

    "abstract": "We analyze the chiral operator ring of the symmetric orbifold conformal field theory on the complex two-plane. We compute the large N limit of the ring and exhibit its factorized leading order behaviour. We moreover calculate all structure constants at the subleading and sub-subleading order. These features are coded as properties of the symmetric group and we review the relevant mathematical theorems on the product of conjugacy classes in the center of the group algebra. We illustrate the efficiency of the formalism by iteratively computing broad classes of higher point extremal correlators. We point out generalizations of our simplest of models and argue that our combinatorial analysis is relevant to the organization of the large N perturbation theory of generic symmetric orbifolds.",

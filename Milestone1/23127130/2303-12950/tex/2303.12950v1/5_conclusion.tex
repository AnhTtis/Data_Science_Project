\section{Conclusion}

%In this paper, we introduced LightPainter, a scribble-based portrait relighting system to enable more intuitive and flexible portrait lighting editing for novice users. LightPainter consists of a skin-tone conditioned delighting module and a scribble-conditioned relighting module. The delighting module allows user to specify a skin color to improve albedo estimation. The relighting interprets lighting effects from freehand scribbles and thus enable more intuitive lighting editing workflow. Extensive experiments including a thorough user study demonstrate the superior performance LightPainter. Our system allows novices to easily pursue convincing portrait lighting effects with just minutes of use. Discussion of limitations can be found in the supplementary material.

In this paper, we introduce LightPainter, a novel interactive and intuitive portrait relighting system that uses free-hand scribbles as the user interface. To address the challenges of relighting with scribbles, we propose novel network designs and a shading-based scribble simulation approach to generate training data.
We also introduce a conditional delighting module that predicts high-quality albedo optionally conditioned on skin tone. Experiments and user study demonstrate the state-of-the-art portrait relighting performance of our method. Noticeably, LightPainter allows users to create desirable portrait lighting effects with ease. Discussion of limitations can be found in the supplementary material.

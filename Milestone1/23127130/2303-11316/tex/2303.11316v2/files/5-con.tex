\section{Conclusion}


In this paper, we have presented a {\em Generative Semantic Segmentation} (\model) approach.
%
Casting semantic segmentation as an image-conditioned mask generation problem, our formulation is drastically distinctive to conventional discriminative learning based alternatives.
%
This is established on a novel notion of maskige
and an efficient optimization algorithm in two stages:
(i) Learning the posterior distribution of the latent variables for segmentation mask reconstruction, and
(ii) minimizing the distance between posterior distribution and the prior distribution of latent variables
for enabling input images to be conditioned on.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our \model{} achieves competitive performance in comparison to prior art discriminative counterparts, whilst establishing new state of the art in the more challenging cross-domain evaluation setting.

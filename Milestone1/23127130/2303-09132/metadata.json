    "abstract": "Viscoelastic materials containing bubbles or drops are encountered in numerous application fields, and are presently the object of much interest. The motion of bubbles and drops in these matrices can be significantly different than in Newtonian fluids. This review is restricted to the case of motion in quiescent fluids (or small Reynolds number) and of small bubbles and drops, that are not appreciably deformed during their motion. It includes a brief description of properties of viscoelastic systems and of the motion of solid particles in these systems. The case of very small drops undergoing Brownian motion is related to recent advances in microrheology. The motion of larger drops and bubbles due to gravity in yield stress fluids is discussed and linked to Ostwald ripening. Recent advances on the understanding of the rheological properties of the composite systems are also briefly discussed.",

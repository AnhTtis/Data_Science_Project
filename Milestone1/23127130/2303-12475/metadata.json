    "abstract": "The dependence of the $q$ and $T$ parameters of the Tsallis-distribution-shaped fragmentation function (FF) on the fragmentation scale (found to be equal to the jet mass) is calculated via the resummation of the branching process of jet fragmentation in the leading-log appriximation (LLA) in the $φ^3$ theory. Jet and hadron spectra in electron-positron ($e^+e^-$) annihilations with 2- and 3-jet final states are calculated using virtual leading partons. It is found that jets, produced earlier in the branching process, are more energetic, and the energy, angle and multiplicity distributions of hadrons stemming from them are broader. It is also found that replacing the LL resummation in the branching process by a single splitting provides good approximation for the jet energy distribution in 2-jet events. Furthermore, a micro-canonical statistical event generator is presented for the event-by-event calculation of hadron momenta in $e^+e^-$ annihilations.",

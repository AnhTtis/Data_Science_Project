@article{Berger2018,
abstract = {Auditory spatial localization in humans is performed using a combination of interaural time differences, interaural level differences, as well as spectral cues provided by the geometry of the ear. To render spatialized sounds within a virtual reality (VR) headset, either individualized or generic Head Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) are usually employed. The former require arduous calibrations, but enable accurate auditory source localization, which may lead to a heightened sense of presence within VR. The latter obviate the need for individualized calibrations, but result in less accurate auditory source localization. Previous research on auditory source localization in the real world suggests that our representation of acoustic space is highly plastic. In light of these findings, we investigated whether auditory source localization could be improved for users of generic HRTFs via cross-modal learning. The results show that pairing a dynamic auditory stimulus, with a spatio-temporally aligned visual counterpart, enabled users of generic HRTFs to improve subsequent auditory source localization. Exposure to the auditory stimulus alone or to asynchronous audiovisual stimuli did not improve auditory source localization. These findings have important implications for human perception as well as the development of VR systems as they indicate that generic HRTFs might be enough to enable good auditory source localization in VR.},

@article{Ahrens2020,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2020 Author(s). This study explored the relationship between perceived sound image size and speech intelligibility for sound sources reproduced over loudspeakers. Sources with varying degrees of spatial energy spread were generated using ambisonics processing. Young normal-hearing listeners estimated sound image size as well as performed two spatial release from masking (SRM) tasks with two symmetrically arranged interfering talkers. Either the target-to-masker ratio or the separation angle was varied adaptively. Results showed that the sound image size did not change systematically with the energy spread. However, a larger energy spread did result in a decreased SRM. Furthermore, the listeners needed a greater angular separation angle between the target and the interfering sources for sources with a larger energy spread. Further analysis revealed that the method employed to vary the energy spread did not lead to systematic changes in the interaural cross correlations. Future experiments with competing talkers using ambisonics or similar methods may consider the resulting energy spread in relation to the minimum separation angle between sound sources in order to avoid degradations in speech intelligibility.},

This study proposes to decrease the total number of measured directions in order to make acoustic measurements more comfortable. To overcome the limit of sparseness for which classical interpola-tion techniques fail to properly reconstruct HRTFs, additional knowledge has to be injected. Focusing on the spatial structure of HRTFs, the analysis of a large HRTF database enables to introduce spatial prototypes. After a pattern recognition process, these prototypes serve as a well-informed background for the reconstruc-tion of any sparsely measured set of individual HRTFs. This technique shows better spatial fidelity than blind interpolation techniques.},

@article{Bronkhorst2015,
abstract = {How do we recognize what one person is saying when others are speaking at the same time? This review summarizes widespread research in psychoacoustics, auditory scene analysis, and attention, all dealing with early processing and selection of speech, which has been stimulated by this question. Important effects occurring at the peripheral and brainstem levels are mutual masking of sounds and “unmasking” resulting from binaural listening. Psychoacoustic models have been developed that can predict these effects accurately, albeit using computational approaches rather than approximations of neural processing. Grouping—the segregation and streaming of sounds—represents a subsequent processing stage that interacts closely with attention. Sounds can be easily grouped—and subsequently selected—using primitive features such as spatial location and fundamental frequency. More complex processing is required when lexical, syntactic, or semantic information is used. Whereas it is now clear that such processing can take place preattentively, there also is evidence that the processing depth depends on the task-relevancy of the sound. This is consistent with the presence of a feedback loop in attentional control, triggering enhancement of to-be-selected input. Despite recent progress, there are still many unresolved issues: there is a need for integrative models that are neurophysiologically plausible, for research into grouping based on other than spatial or voice-related cues, for studies explicitly addressing endogenous and exogenous attention, for an explanation of the remarkable sluggishness of attention focused on dynamically changing sounds, and for research elucidating the distinction between binaural speech perception and sound localization.},

@article{Romigh2014,
abstract = {It is widely acknowledged that individualized head-related transfer function (HRTF) measurements are needed to adequately capture all of the 3D spatial hearing cues. However, many perceptual studies have shown that localization accuracy in the lateral dimension is only minimally decreased by the use of non-individualized head-related transfer functions. This evidence supports the idea that the individualized components of an HRTF could be isolated from those that are more general in nature. In the present study we decomposed the HRTF at each location into average, lateral and intraconic spectral components, along with an ITD in an effort to isolate the sound localization cues that are responsible for the inter-individual differences in localization performance. HRTFs for a given listener were then reconstructed systematically with components that were both individualized and non-individualized in nature, and the effect of each modification was analyzed via a virtual localization test where brief 250 ms noise bursts were rendered with the modified HRTFs. Results indicate that the cues important for individualization of HRTFs are contained almost exclusively in the intraconic portion of the HRTF spectra and localization is only minimally affected by introducing non-individualized cues into the other HRTF components. These results provide new insights into what specific inter-individual differences in head-related acoustical features are most relevant to sound localization, and provide a framework for how future human-machine interfaces might be more effectively generalized and/or individualized.},

abstract = {Spatial selective attention enables listeners to process a signal of interest in natural settings. However, most past studies on auditory spatial attention used impoverished spatial cues: presenting competing sounds to different ears, using only interaural differences in time (ITDs) and/or intensity (IIDs), or using non-individualized head-related transfer functions (HRTFs). Here we tested the hypothesis that impoverished spatial cues impair spatial auditory attention by only weakly engaging relevant cortical networks. Eighteen normal-hearing listeners reported the content of one of two competing syllable streams simulated at roughly +30 ° and −30° azimuth. The competing streams consisted of syllables from two different-sex talkers. Spatialization was based on natural spatial cues (individualized HRTFs), individualized IIDs, or generic ITDs. We measured behavioral performance as well as electroencephalographic markers of selective attention. Behaviorally, subjects recalled target streams most accurately with natural cues. Neurally, spatial attention significantly modulated early evoked sensory response magnitudes only for natural cues, not in conditions using only ITDs or IIDs. Consistent with this, parietal oscillatory power in the alpha band (8-14 Hz; associated with filtering out distracting events from unattended directions) showed significantly less attentional modulation with isolated spatial cues than with natural cues. Our findings support the hypothesis that spatial selective attention networks are only partially engaged by impoverished spatial auditory cues. These results not only suggest that studies using unnatural spatial cues underestimate the neural effects of spatial auditory attention, they also illustrate the importance of preserving natural spatial cues in assistive listening devices to support robust attentional control.},

abstract = {Binaural room impulse responses (BRIRs) were measured in a classroom for sources at different azimuths and distances (up to 1 m) relative to a manikin located in four positions in a classroom. When the listener is far from all walls, reverberant energy distorts signal magnitude and phase independently at each frequency, altering monaural spectral cues, interaural phase differences, and interaural level differences. For the tested conditions, systematic distortion (comb-filtering) from an early intense reflection is only evident when a listener is very close to a wall, and then only in the ear facing the wall. Especially for a nearby source, interaural cues grow less reliable with increasing source laterality and monaural spectral cues are less reliable in the ear farther from the sound source. Reverberation reduces the magnitude of interaural level differences at all frequencies; however, the direct-sound interaural time difference can still be recovered from the BRIRs measured in these experiments. Results suggest that bias and variability in sound localization behavior may vary systematically with listener location in a room as well as source location relative to the listener, even for nearby sources where there is relatively little reverberant energy.},

abstract = {This study measured the ability of subjects to localize broadband sound sources that varied in both horizontal and vertical location. Brief (150 ms) sounds were presented in a free field, and subjects reported the apparent stimulus location by turning to face the sound source; head orientation was measured electromagnetically. Localization of continuous sounds also was tested to estimate errors in the motor act of orienting with the head. Localization performance was excellent for brief sounds presented in front of the subject. The smallest errors, averaged across subjects, were about 2 degrees and 3.5 degrees in the horizontal and vertical dimensions, respectively. The sizes of errors increased, for more peripheral stimulus locations, to maxima of about 20 degrees. Localization performance was better in the horizontal than in the vertical dimension for stimuli located on or near the frontal midline, but the opposite was true for most stimuli located further peripheral. Front/back confusions occurred in 6{\%} of trials; the characteristics of those responses suggest that subjects derived horizontal localization information principally from interaural difference cues. The generally high level of performance obtained with the head orientation technique argues for its utility in continuing studies of sound localization.},

abstract = {Auralizations are commonly used today by architectural acousticians as a tool to model acoustically sensitive spaces. This paper presents investigations employing an auralization methodology known as multi-channel auralizations, to determine the benefits of using an increasing number of channels in such auralizations. First an objective evaluation was conducted to examine how acoustic parameters, such as reverberation time, vary when using "quadrant" (one fourth of a spherical source) or " thirteenth" sources to create the binaural room impulse responses. Large differences in the values were found between the different sections of the sphere, on the order of several just noticeable differences. Two subjective studies were then pursued, first to determine if auralizations made with an increasing number of channels sound more realistic and have an increased perceived source size, using solo musical instruments of varying directivity indices as the sources. Overall, subjects perceived the auralizations made with an increasing number of channels as more realistic, whereas results for perceived source size are less clear. The second subjective study assessed the ease with which subjects could identify the source orientation from the auralizations as a function of number of channels. Results indicate that more channels made it easier for subjects to differentiate between source orientations. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Removing position as a cue resulted in substantial degradation of sensitivity to IID. The overall patterning of the data suggests that threshold-IIDs measured in standard binaural paradigms that yield fused intracranial images reflect the use of changes in intracranial position. That is, comparisons among the data suggest that listeners' judgments depend upon binaural spatial cues and not on comparisons of the concomitant monaural increments and decrements in level, per se, that inevitably result from the imposition of IIDs.},

This work has demonstrated that calibrating a VPS using metrics based on Support will result in an accurate simulation of a test space according to known acoustic metrics such as T30. A comparison of quantities referring to earlier parts of the response, such as Early Decay Time (EDT), show some errors which are thought to be caused by the non-anechoic nature of the reproduction space.},

For a fixed source-receiver distance, twenty CC functions were collected as the source and receiver were moved to different locations in the room. The peaks of the CC functions were taken as measures of binaural coherence. Plots were made of binaural coherence as a function of frequency for five rooms and several source-receiver distances (3m, 6m, and 12m). Attempts were made to interpret the coherence plots in terms of geometrical, material, and acoustical properties of the different rooms in order to develop some intuition about the statistical behavior of the coherence function in rooms. Correctly interpreted, in coordination with headphone lateralization studies, the measured values of binaural coherence are expected to indicate the utility of the steady-state interaural time difference cue in sound localization},

For a practical example we chose a spherical array with 32 elements. The microphones are located at the center of the faces of a truncated icosahedron. The radius of the sphere is 5 cm.

ERPs are time-locked brain potentials that occur in response to cognitive, motor or perceptual events. The events used by Davis were sounds, and in the decades that followed her landmark study ERP research significantly contributed to the knowledge of auditory perception and neurophysiology we have today. ERPs are very well suited to study neural responses to sound stimuli, since the researcher can monitor the brain's registration of sound edges and spectral changes in sound on a millisecond-by-millisecond basis. In this overview we will introduce basic concepts of auditory ERP research. The overview includes descriptions of typical ERP components, experimental paradigms, sound stimuli, research methodology, and ways to analyze data.},

abstract = {Human sound localization relies on binaural difference cues for sound-source azimuth and pinna-related spectral shape cues for sound elevation. Although the interaural timing and level difference cues are weighted to produce a percept of sound azimuth, much less is known about binaural mechanisms underlying elevation perception. This problem is particularly interesting for the frontal hemifield, where binaural inputs are of comparable strength. In this paper, localization experiments are described in which hearing for each ear was either normal, or spectrally disrupted by a mold fitted to the external ear. Head-fixed saccadic eye movements were used as a rapid and accurate indicator of perceived sound direction in azimuth and elevation. In the control condition (both ears free) azimuth and elevation components of saccadic responses were well described by a linear regression line for the entire measured range. For unilateral mold conditions, the azimuth response components did not differ from controls. The influence of the mold on elevation responses was largest on the ipsilateral side, and declined systematically with azimuth towards the side of the free ear. Near the midsagittal plane the elevation responses were clearly affected by the mold, suggesting a systematic binaural interaction in the neural computation of perceived elevation that straddles the midline. A quantitative comparison of responses from the unilateral mold, the bilateral mold and control condition provided evidence that the fusion process can be described by binaural weighted averaging. Two different conceptual schemes are discussed that could underlie the observed responses.},

@article{Rakerd1985,
abstract = {Auditory localization was studied in a room bounded by a single acoustically reflective surface. The position of that surface was varied so as to stimulate a floor, a ceiling, and left and right side walls. The surface was eliminated in one condition so that we could examine localization in free field for purposes of comparison. Using a source identification method we assessed the influences of these various room configurations on the localization of both slow-onset and impulsive sine tones of low frequency (500 Hz). We also measured the steady-state interaural-time-difference (ITD) and interaural-intensity-difference (IID) cues available to subjects in the different room configurations and compared these data with the perceptual judgments. Our results indicate the following: (1) A sound must include transients if the precedence effect is to operate as an aid to its localization in rooms. (2) Even if transients are present the precedence effect does not eliminate all influences of room reflections. (3) Due to the interference of reflections large interaural intensity differences may occur in a room and these have a considerable influence on localization; this is true even at low frequencies for which IID cues do not exist in a free field. (4) Listeners appear to have certain expectations about the reliability and plausibility of various directional cues and perceptually weight the cues accordingly; we suggest that this may explain, in part, the large variation in time-intensity trading ratios reported in the literature and also the differing reports regarding the importance of onsets for localization. (5) In this study we find that onset cues are of some importance to localization even in free field.},

The sound field produced by a single loudspeaker positioned in a normal listening room has been simulated using an electroacoustical synthesis of the direct sound, 17 individual reflections and the reverberant field. The threshold of detection was measured using the method of adjustment for five reflections using three subjects for noise and speech. The thresholds have been measured for two simulated situations (1) a loudspeaker with a frequency independent directivity characteristics and frequency independent absorption coefficients of the room surfaces and (2) a loudspeaker with directivity similar to a standard two-way system and absorption coefficients according to measurements of real materials. The results have shown that subjects can reliably distinguish between timbre and spatial aspect of the sound field, that the spectral energy above 2 kHz of the individual reflection determines the importance of the reflection for the spatial aspects, and that only the first order floor reflection will contribute to the spatial aspects.},

The threshold of detection and just-noticeable differences for an increase in level were measured for individual reflections using eight subjects for noise and speech. The results have shown that the first-order floor and ceiling reflections are likely to individually contribute to the timbre of reproduced speech. For a noise signal, additional reflections from the left sidewall will contribute individually. The level of the reverberant field has been found to have an effect on the contribution of the individual reflections. An increase in the level of individual reflections are most likely to be audible for the first-order floor and ceiling reflections, and certain reflections from the sidewalls.},

@article{Middlebrooks1991,
abstract = {In keeping with our promise earlier in this review, we summarize here the process by which we believe spatial cues are used for localizing a sound source in a free-field listening situation. We believe it entails two parallel processes: 1. The azimuth of the source is determined using differences in interaural time or interaural intensity, whichever is present. Wightman and colleagues (1989) believe the low-frequency temporal information is dominant if both are present. 2. The elevation of the source is determined from spectral shape cues. The received sound spectrum, as modified by the pinna, is in effect compared with a stored set of directional transfer functions. These are actually the spectra of a nearly flat source heard at various elevations. The elevation that corresponds to the best-matching transfer function is selected as the locus of the sound. Pinnae are similar enough between people that certain general rules (e.g. Blauert's boosted bands or Butler's covert peaks) can describe this process. Head motion is probably not a critical part of the localization process, except in cases where time permits a very detailed assessment of location, in which case one tries to localize the source by turning the head toward the putative location. Sound localization is only moderately more precise when the listener points directly toward the source. The process is not analogous to localizing a visual source on the fovea of the retina. Thus, head motion provides only a moderate increase in localization accuracy. Finally, current evidence does not support the view that auditory motion perception is anything more than detection of changes in static location over time.},

@article{Shinn-Cunningham2000a,
abstract = {To a first-order approximation, binaural localization cues are ambiguous: many source locations give rise to nearly the same interaural differences. For sources more than a meter away, binaural localization cues are approximately equal for any source on a cone centered on the interaural axis (i.e., the well-known "cone of confusion"). The current paper analyzes simple geometric approximations of a head to gain insight into localization performance for nearby sources. If the head is treated as a rigid, perfect sphere, interaural intensity differences (IIDs) can be broken down into two main components. One component depends on the head shadow and is constant along the cone of confusion (and covaries with the interaural time difference, or ITD). The other component depends only on the relative path lengths from the source to the two ears and is roughly constant for a sphere centered on the interaural axis. This second factor is large enough to be perceptible only when sources are within one or two meters of the listener. Results are not dramatically different if one assumes that the ears are separated by 160 deg along the surface of the sphere (rather than diametrically opposite one another). Thus for nearby sources, binaural information should allow listeners to locate sources within a volume around a circle centered on the interaural axis on a "torus of confusion." The volume of the torus of confusion increases as the source approaches the median plane, degenerating to a volume around the median plane in the limit.},

This paper describes steps taken to convert the illusion into an experiment in order to study the localization precedence effect as it operates in rooms. The results of the experiment suggest that there are two components to the illusion: The first is the inability of listeners to localize a sine tone in a room in the absence of an onset; the second is the obscuring of modulation cues by the irregular transient response of a room. Experiments show that the Franssen effect fails completely in an anechoic environment, as expected if the effect depends upon the implausibility of steady-state cues in a room. The Franssen effect also fails when the spectrum of the sound is dense.},

abstract = {Virtual auditory displays (VAD) aim to create virtual sources at various directions and distances in headphone reproduction by using binaural synthesis based on head-related transfer functions (HRTFs). Incorporating the variation of binaural signals caused by head turning in three dimensions of freedom, a dynamic VAD reduces front-back and up-down confusions, and improves the externalization of perceived virtual sources. It is well known that individualized far-field HRTFs can also help to improve the direction perception. In the present work, a virtual source localization experiment is conducted to further examine the effect of individualized near-field HRTFs on distance perception in dynamic virtual auditory display. Results indicate that dynamic binaural synthesis with both individualized and non-individualized near-field HRTFs can create perceived virtual source at various target distance within 1.0 m deviating from the median plane, especially at the lateral directions. Individualized HRTFs have little influence on distance perception, but improve the accuracy of direction perception in terms of elevation errors.},

@article{Rakerd1986,
abstract = {The steady-state sound field of a sine tone does not provide useful localization information in a room. Nevertheless, listeners can localize a sine tone in a room if it has an onset transient which allows the precedence effect to operate. In the present study, we made a quantitative assessment of onsets and the precedence effect by systematically varying onset duration from 0 s (impulsive), where the precedence effect is maximal, to 5 s, where there is no precedence effect at all. We also assessed listeners' sensitivity to the steady-state sound field under impulsive conditions by varying the total duration of tone pulses. Our experiments were conducted in a room with a single acoustical reflection having various directions and delays, and in an anechoic room. The results for tones of various frequencies (500 and 2000 Hz) and sound-pressure levels (65 and 40 dBA) indicate the following: Localization in rooms is facilitated by onsets even if the onsets are as long as 100 ms. The facilitation depends upon the peak intensity of the tone, as well as the onset duration, suggesting that onset rate is critical for the precedence effect; our results are most consistent with rate expressed as an increase in sound pressure per unit time. The facilitation also depends upon the reflection delay time for a room; gradual onsets take on much more importance for the precedence effect in rooms with long delays. As onsets begin to lose their effectiveness listeners become increasingly "misdirected" by invalid cues in the steady-state sound field. The pattern of misdirection suggests a perceptual averaging of cues over an interval more than an order of magnitude longer than previous estimates of the summation window for the precedence effect. The pattern of misdirection varies with the frequency of a tone, due to frequency-dependent interference effects in a room, but it is independent of signal level. Localization of an impulsive sine tone in rooms is very insensitive to the pulse duration; this suggests that binaural inhibition models of the precedence effect must be supplemented by an evaluative component that we term the "plausibility hypothesis."},

abstract = {Some blind humans have developed echolocation, as a method of navigation in space. Echolocation is a truly active sense because subjects analyze echoes of dedicated, self-generated sounds to assess space around them. Using a special virtual space technique, we assess how humans perceive enclosed spaces through echolocation, thereby revealing the interplay between sensory and vocal-motor neural activity while humans perform this task. Sighted subjects were trained to detect small changes in virtual-room size analyzing real-time generated echoes of their vocalizations. Individual differences in performance were related to the type and number of vocalizations produced. We then asked subjects to estimate virtual-room size with either active or passive sounds while measuring their brain activity with fMRI. Subjects were better at estimating room size when actively vocalizing. This was reflected in the hemodynamic activity of vocal-motor cortices, even after individual motor and sensory components were removed. Activity in these areas also varied with perceived room size, although the vocal-motor output was unchanged. In addition, thalamic and auditory-midbrain activity was correlated with perceived room size; a likely result of top-down auditory pathways for human echolocation, comparable with those described in echolocating bats. Our data provide evidence that human echolocation is supported by active sensing, both behaviorally and in terms of brain activity. The neural sensory-motor coupling complements the fundamental acoustic motor-sensory coupling via the environment in echolocation.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTPassive listening is the predominant method for examining brain activity during echolocation, the auditory analysis of self-generated sounds. We show that sighted humans perform better when they actively vocalize than during passive listening. Correspondingly, vocal motor and cerebellar activity is greater during active echolocation than vocalization alone. Motor and subcortical auditory brain activity covaries with the auditory percept, although motor output is unchanged. Our results reveal behaviorally relevant neural sensory-motor coupling during echolocation.},

T. Yin, and William M. Hartmann. Psychophysical and physiological evidence for a precedence effect in the median sagittal plane. J. Neurophysiol. 77: 2223–2226, 1997. A listener in a room is exposed to multiple versions of any acoustical event, coming from many different directions in space. The precedence effect is thought to discount the reflected sounds in the computation of location, so that a listener perceives the source near its true location. According to most auditory theories, the precedence effect is mediated by binaural differences. This report presents evidence that the precedence effect operates in the median sagittal plane, where binaural differences are virtually absent and where spectral cues provide information regarding the location of sounds. Parallel studies were conducted in psychophysics by measuring human listeners{\&}{\#}039; performance, and in neurophysiology by measuring responses of single neurons in the inferior colliculus of cats. In both experiments the precedence effect was found to operate similarly in the azimuthal and sagittal planes. It is concluded that precedence is mediated by binaurally based and spectrally based localization cues in the azimuthal and sagittal planes, respectively. Thus,models that attribute the precedence effect entirely to processes that involve binaural differences are no longer viable. Footnotes Address for reprint requests: R.

abstract = {Real-world sound sources are usually perceived as externalized and thus properly localized in both direction and distance. This is largely due to (1) the acoustic filtering by the head, torso, and pinna, resulting in modifications of the signal spectrum and thereby a frequency-dependent shaping of interaural cues and (2) interaural cues provided by the reverberation inside an enclosed space. This study first investigated the effect of room reverberation on the spectro-temporal behavior of interaural level differences (ILDs) by analyzing dummy-head recordings of speech played at different distances in a standard listening room. Next, the effect of ILD fluctuations on the degree of externalization was investigated in a psychoacoustic experiment performed in the same listening room. Individual binaural impulse responses were used to simulate a distant sound source delivered via headphones. The ILDs were altered using a gammatone filterbank for analysis and resynthesis, where the envelopes of the left and right-ear signals were modified such that the naturally occurring fluctuations of the ILDs were restricted. This manipulation reduced the perceived degree of externalization. This was consistent with the analysis of short-term ILDs at different distances showing that a decreased distance to the sound source also reduced the ILD fluctuations.},

abstract = {Learning of reverberation cues for auditory distance perception Norbert Kopco, Pierre Silvera, Konstantin Tskhay, Beata Tomoriova, and Aaron Seitz Technical University of Kosice, Slovakia; University of California, Riverside Listeners must calibrate to the room acoustics in order to judge source distance using reverberation. A learning process underlies this calibration, resulting in improved performance when auditory distance is examined repeatedly in the same room over the course of days. The processes of calibration and learning are spontaneous, not requiring any feedback about the actual target location. The current study examined whether the amount of spontaneous learning in rooms is dependent on the relative strength with which the reverberation cue is used for the distance judgments. Listeners judged distance of broadband noise bursts presented from distances ranging from 0.15 to 2 m directly ahead of the listener in a small rectangular classroom. The stimulus presentation level was either roved from trial to trial (R runs) or it was fixed within an experimental run (F runs). The subjects performed several experimental sessions over multiple days. One subject group was trained on the F runs, one on the R runs. Learning was observed in the R group but not in the F group, confirming that focusing on the reverberation cue is required for the learning and room calibration to occur.

The applied analysis and synthesis methods were introduced in a companion paper. Time-frequency analysis is used to obtain directional and diffuseness information from the recorded sound field. Nondiffuse sound is then reproduced as pointlike virtual sources, and diffuse sound is synthesized with a decorrelation technique. The proposed synthesis methods for diffuse sound are examined in more detail and a hybrid method is derived. The relationship between diffuseness and interaural coherence is also studied. In addition, results of two listening tests are presented. It is shown that with a large loudspeaker setup under anechoic conditions, SIRR reproduction is at best indistinguishable from the original sample. Furthermore, in a listening test conducted in a standard listening room with real measured responses, SIRR reproduction is evaluated as the most natural one of the systems studied.},

abstract = {Head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) represent the acoustic transfer function from a sound source at a given location to the ear drums of a human. They are typically measured from discrete source positions at a constant distance. Spherical harmonics decompositions have been shown to provide a flexible representation of HRTFs. Practical constraints often prevent the retrieval of measurement data from certain directions, a circumstance that complicates the decomposition of the measured data into spherical harmonics. A least-squares fit of coefficients is a potential approach to determining the coefficients of incomplete data. However, a straightforward non-regularized fit tends to give unrealistic estimates for the region were no measurement data is available. Recently, a regularized least-squares fit was proposed, which yields well-behaved results for the unknown region at the expense of reducing the accuracy of the data representation in the known region. In this paper, we propose using a lower-order non-regularized least-squares fit to achieve a well-behaved estimation of the unknown data. This data then allows for a high-order non-regularized least-squares fit over the entire sphere. We compare the properties of all three approaches applied to modeling the magnitudes of the HRTFs measured from a manikin. The proposed approach reduces the normalized mean-square error by approximately 7 dB in the known region and 11 dB in the unknown region compared to the regularized fit. {\textcopyright} 2012 APSIPA.},

This paper presents an analysis of this process using a freely-available full-sphere HRTF dataset measured on a 2702-point Lebedev grid. It is shown that for limited modal order, the interpolation accuracy can be improved by first extracting the onset delays and processing these separately. With spherical harmonics up to 35th order, the interpolation was found to be indistinguishable from measured HRTF data, using a 2-AFC listening test. A multiple stimulus rating test confirmed that these differences are inaudible whilst indicating that a nearest neighbour selection is audible. When using spherical harmonics up to only 5th order, the differences are clearly audible, however separate onset processing leads to much smaller differences.},

abstract = {It is long known that to correctly reproduce a binaural signal through a pair of loudspeakers, this signal has to be pre-filtered to compensate for the crosstalk effect that will otherwise ruin the spatial clues contained on the binaural signal. In this work we make a brief review of the design technique for crosstalk cancellation (CTC) filters specially focused on its application in virtual reality installations and discuss still open dilemmas. CTC filters are designed based on the transfer paths between loudspeakers and listener ears and usually delivers channel separations of over 20 dB in a small region around the listeners head, the so-called sweet spot. If the listener moves away from the sweet spot, channel separation will deteriorate and the spatial cues from the binaural signal will be lost. A great deal of researchers tried to answer the question on how to increase the size of the sweep spot through a more skilled system setup, specially important for virtual reality applications where the users should be allowed to freely move and rotate their heads. For such applications dynamic CTC systems can be implemented with the aid of a head-tracking device to determine distance and orientation of the listener's head to the loudspeakers, allowing a constant update of the cancellation filters.},

abstract = {Past research has suggested that virtual auditory displays are most accurate when implemented using individualized head‐related transfer functions (HRTFs). Directional localization accuracy, for example, is often substantially degraded when nonindividualized HRTFs are used, due to the resulting distortion of spectral cues to sound source direction. Although equally important for accurate spatial representation, little is known about distance localization accuracy in virtual auditory displays, and specifically, whether individualized HRTFs are necessary for accurate distance localization. Here, distance localization accuracy was assessed for six listeners, using both individualized and nonindividualized HRTFs in separate blocks of trials. The virtual sound sources were produced from special HRTF measurements (source distance ranging from 0.3 to 13.8 m) that also contained the acoustic transfer characteristics of a semireverberant room environment. This provided listeners with additional acoustic cues to source distance, including the ratio of direct‐to‐reverberant sound energy. Since no significant differences were observed in listener's judgments of apparent sound source distance in the two stimulus conditions, it is concluded that distance localization accuracy, and degree of sound source externalization, do not depend on the use of individualized HRTFs when natural reverberation is available to the listener.},

A self-report instrument was employed to assess the amount of neuropathic noise (here defined as sounds with levels exceeding approximately 80 dBA) each participant had been exposed to and sensitivity to temporal-fine-structure and temporal-envelope information was determined using frequency discrimination and envelope irregularity detection tasks, respectively. Despite sizable individual variability in all measures, correlations between noise exposure and the ability to process temporal cues were small and non-significant.},

abstract = {We present a time-spread echo-based audio watermarking scheme with optimized imperceptibility and robustness. Specifically, convex optimization based finite-impulse-response (FIR) filter design is utilized to obtain the optimal echo filter coefficients. The desired power spectrum of the echo filter is shaped by the proposed maximum power spectral margin (MPSM) and the absolute threshold of hearing (ATH) of human auditory system (HAS) to ensure the optimal imperceptibility. Meanwhile, the auto-correlation function of the echo filter coefficients is specified as the constraint in the problem formulation, which controls the robustness in terms of watermark detection. In this way, a joint optimization of imperceptibility and robustness can be quantitatively performed. As a result, the proposed watermarking scheme is superior to existing solutions such as the ones based on pseudo noise (PN) sequence or modified pseudo noise (MPN) sequence. Note that the designed echo kernel is also highly secure in that only with the same filter coefficients can one successfully detect the watermark. Experimental results are provided to evaluate the imperceptibility and robustness of the proposed watermarking scheme.},

abstract = {A round robin was conducted to evaluate the state of the art of room acoustic modeling software both in the physical and perceptual realms. The test was based on six acoustic scenes highlighting specific acoustic phenomena and for three complex, “real-world” spatial environments. The results demonstrate that most present simulation algorithms generate obvious model errors once the assumptions of geometrical acoustics are no longer met. As a consequence, they are neither able to provide a reliable pattern of early reflections nor do they provide a reliable prediction of room acoustic parameters outside a medium frequency range. In the perceptual domain, the algorithms under test could generate mostly plausible but not authentic auralizations, i.e., the difference between simulated and measured impulse responses of the same scene was always clearly audible. Most relevant for this perceptual difference are deviations in tone color and source position between measurement and simulation, which to a large extent can be traced back to the simplified use of random incidence absorption and scattering coefficients and shortcomings in the simulation of early reflections due to the missing or insufficient modeling of diffraction.},

The headphone stimuli were digitally processed with the aim of duplicating, at a listener's eardrums, the waveforms that were produced by the free-field stimuli. The processing algorithms were based on each subject's free-field-to-eardrum transfer functions that had been measured at 144 free-field source locations. The headphone stimuli were localized by eight subjects in virtually the same positions as the corresponding free-field stimuli. However, with headphone stimuli, there were more front-back confusions, and source elevation seemed slightly less well defined. One subject's difficulty with elevation judgments, which was observed both with free-field and with headphone stimuli, was traced to distorted features of the free-field-to-eardrum transfer function.},

The derived spatial basis modes can achieve HRTF near-field and far-field representation in one formulation. The HRTF frequency components are expanded using Fourier Spherical Bessel series for compact representation. The proposed model can be used to reconstruct HRTFs at any arbitrary position in space and at any frequency point from a finite number of measurements.

The sound field produced by a single loudspeaker positioned in a normal listening room has been simulated using an electroacoustical synthesis of the direct sound, 17 individual reflections and the reverberant field. The threshold of detection was measured using the method of adjustment for five reflections using three subjects for noise and speech. The thresholds have been measured for two simulated situations (1) a loudspeaker with a frequency independent directivity characteristics and frequency independent absorption coefficients of the room surfaces and (2) a loudspeaker with directivity similar to a standard two-way system and absorption coefficients according to measurements of real materials. The results have shown that subjects can reliably distinguish between timbre and spatial aspect of the sound field, that the spectral energy above 2 kHz of the individual reflection determines the importance of the reflection for the spatial aspects, and that only the first order floor reflection will contribute to the spatial aspects.},

abstract = {For playback of binaural signals a flat frequency response of the reproduction chain is desired. Typically used headphones may induce spectral coloration if not properly compensated. Although most headphones are said to provide approximations of a diffuse- or free-field equalization, headphone transfer functions (HpTFs) may differ significantly between different manufacturers and models. Moreover, HpTFs of circum- and supraaural headphones are susceptible to leakage and high frequency variability introduced by repositioning. From former studies, many of these effects could be expected to be minimized when using an extraaural headphone with a linear frequency response. Additionally, such a design can be used straightforward for individual headphone compensation and for low frequency extension with a subwoofer while best approaching the "free field equivalent coupling"-criterion demanded for binaural playback devices. The paper discusses the technical development of a prototype of such a headphone.},

An SH-encoded scene can be rendered binaurally by applying SH-encoded head-related transfer functions (HRTFs). Limitations of the recording equipment or computational constraints dictate the spatial reproduction accuracy, thus rendering might suffer from spatial degradation as well as coloration. This paper studies the effect of tapering the SH representation of a binaurally rendered sound field in conjunction with its spectral equalization. The proposed approach is shown to reduce coloration and thus improves perceived audio quality.},

abstract = {Neuronal mechanisms of auditory distance perception are poorly understood, largely because contributions of intensity and distance processing are difficult to differentiate. Typically, the received intensity increases when sound sources approach us. However, we can also distinguish between soft-but-nearby and loud-but-distant sounds, indicating that distance processing can also be based on intensity-independent cues. Here, we combined behavioral experiments, fMRI measurements, and computational analyses to identify the neural representation of distance independent of intensity. In a virtual reverberant environment, we simulated sound sources at varying distances (15-100 cm) along the right-side interaural axis. Our acoustic analysis suggested that, of the individual intensity-independent depth cues available for these stimuli, direct-to-reverberant ratio (D/R) is more reliable and robust than interaural level difference (ILD). However, on the basis of our behavioral results, subjects' discrimination performance was more consistent with complex intensity-independent distance representations, combining both available cues, than with representations on the basis of either D/R or ILD individually. fMRI activations to sounds varying in distance (containing all cues, including intensity), compared with activations to sounds varying in intensity only, were significantly increased in the planum temporale and posterior superior temporal gyrus contralateral to the direction of stimulation. This fMRI result suggests that neurons in posterior nonprimary auditory cortices, in or near the areas processing other auditory spatial features, are sensitive to intensity-independent sound properties relevant for auditory distance perception.},

We propose a psycho-acoustically motivated, anthropometry based mismatch function between HRTF pairs, that exploits the close relation between the listener's pinna geometry and localization cues. This is evaluated using an auditory model that computes a mapping between HRTF spectra and perceived spatial locations. Results on a large number of subjects in the CIPIC and ARI HRTF databases suggest that there exists a non-individual HRTF set which allows a listener to have an equally accurate vertical localization than with individual HRTFs. Furthermore, we find the optimal parametrization of the proposed mismatch function, i.e. the one that best reflects the information given by the auditory model. Our findings show that the selection procedure yields statistically significant improvements with respect to dummy-head HRTFs or random HRTF selection, with potentially high impact from an applicative point of view.},

abstract = {Conventional watermarking techniques based on echo hiding provide many benefits, but also have several disadvantages, for example, a lenient decoding process, weakness against multiple encoding attacks, etc. In this paper, to improve the weak points of conventional echo hiding, we propose a time-spread echo as an alternative to the single echo in conventional echo hiding. Spreading an echo in the time domain is achieved by using pseudonoise (PN) sequences. By spreading the echo, the amplitude of each echo can be reduced, i.e., the energy of each echo becomes small, so that the distortion induced by watermarking is imperceptible to humans while the decoding performance of the embedded watermarks is better maintained as compared with the case of conventional echo hiding, as shown by computer simulations, in which several parameters, such as the amplitude and length of PN sequences and analysis window length, were varied. Robustness against typical signal processing was also evaluated in these simulations and showed fair performance. Results of a listening test using some pieces of music showed good imperceptibility.},

abstract = {The effects of stimulus frequency and bandwidth on distance perception were examined for nearby sources in simulated reverberant space. Sources to the side [containing reverberation-related cues and interaural level difference (ILD) cues] and to the front (without ILDs) were simulated. Listeners judged the distance of noise bursts presented at a randomly roving level from simulated distances ranging from 0.15 to 1.7 m. Six stimuli were tested, varying in center frequency (300-5700 Hz) and bandwidth (200-5400 Hz). Performance, measured as the correlation between simulated and response distances, was worse for frontal than for lateral sources. For both simulated directions, performance was inversely proportional to the low-frequency stimulus cutoff, independent of stimulus bandwidth. The dependence of performance on frequency was stronger for frontal sources. These correlation results were well summarized by considering how mean response, as opposed to response variance, changed with stimulus direction and spectrum: (1) little bias was observed for lateral sources, but listeners consistently overestimated distance for frontal nearby sources; (2) for both directions, increasing the low-frequency cut-off reduced the range of responses. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that listeners used a direction-independent but frequency-dependent mapping of a reverberation-related cue, not the ILD cue, to judge source distance.},

abstract = {Although the ratio of direct-to-reverberant sound energy is known to be an important acoustic cue to sound source distance, human sensitivity to changes in this cue is largely unknown. Here, direct-to-reverberant energy discrimination thresholds were measured for six listeners using virtual sound source techniques that allow for convenient and precise control of this stimulus parameter. Four different types of source stimuli were tested: a 50 ms noise burst with abrupt onset/offset, a 300 ms duration noise burst with gradual onset/offset, a speech syllable, and an impulse. Over a range of direct-to-reverberant ratios from 0 to 20 dB, an adaptive 2AFC procedure (3-down, 1-up) was used to measure discrimination thresholds. For all stimuli, these thresholds ranged from 5 to 6 dB. A post hoc fitting procedure confirmed that slopes of the psychometric functions were homogeneous across stimulus conditions and listeners. These threshold results suggest that direct-to-reverberant energy ratio by itself provides only a course coding of sound source distance, because threshold values correspond to greater than 2-fold changes in physical distance for the acoustic environment under examination.},

abstract = {Binaural rendering allows us to reproduce auditory scenes through headphones while preserving spatial cues. The best results are achieved if the headphone effect is compensated with an individualized filter, which depends on the headphone transfer function, ear morphology and fitting. However, due to the high complexity of remeasuring a new filter every time the user repositions the headphone, generic compensation may be of interest. In this study, the effects of generic headphone equalization in binaural rendering are evaluated objectively and subjectively, with respect to unequalized and individually-equalized cases. Results show that generic headphone equalization yields perceptual benefits similar to individual equalization for non-individual binaural renderings, and it increases overall quality, reduces coloration, and improves distance perception compared to unequalized renderings.},

abstract = {The human ability to localize sound is essential for monitoring our environment and helps us to analyse complex auditory scenes. Although the acoustic cues mediating sound localization have been established, it remains unknown how these cues are represented in human cortex. In particular, it is still a point of contention whether binaural and monaural cues are processed by the same or distinct cortical networks. In this study, participants listened to a sequence of auditory stimuli from different spatial locations while we recorded their neural activity using electroencephalography (EEG). The stimuli were presented over a loudspeaker array, which allowed us to deliver realistic, free-field stimuli in both the horizontal and vertical planes. Using a multivariate classification approach, we showed that it is possible to decode sound source location from scalp-recorded EEG. Robust and consistent decoding was shown for stimuli that provide binaural cues (i.e. Left vs. Right stimuli). Decoding location when only monaural cues were available (i.e. Front vs. Rear and elevational stimuli) was successful for a subset of subjects and showed less consistency. Notably, the spatio-temporal pattern of EEG features that facilitated decoding differed based on the availability of binaural and monaural cues. In particular, we identified neural processing of binaural cues at around 120 ms post-stimulus and found that monaural cues are processed later between 150 and 200 ms. Furthermore, different spatial activation patterns emerged for binaural and monaural cue processing. These spatio-temporal dissimilarities suggest the involvement of separate cortical mechanisms in monaural and binaural acoustic cue processing.},

abstract = {In everyday listening, sound reaches our ears directly from a source as well as indirectly via reflections known as reverberation. Reverberation profoundly distorts the sound from a source, yet humans can both identify sound sources and distinguish environments from the resulting sound, via mechanisms that remain unclear. The core computational challenge is that the acoustic signatures of the source and environment are combined in a single signal received by the ear. Here we ask whether our recognition of sound sources and spaces reflects an ability to separate their effects and whether any such separation is enabled by statistical regularities of real-world reverberation. To first determine whether such statistical regularities exist, we measured impulse responses (IRs) of 271 spaces sampled from the distribution encountered by humans during daily life. The sampled spaces were diverse, but their IRs were tightly constrained, exhibiting exponential decay at frequency-dependent rates: Mid frequencies reverberated longest whereas higher and lower frequencies decayed more rapidly, presumably due to absorptive properties of materials and air. To test whether humans leverage these regularities, we manipulated IR decay characteristics in simulated reverberant audio. Listeners could discriminate sound sources and environments from these signals, but their abilities degraded when reverberation characteristics deviated from those of real-world environments. Subjectively, atypical IRs were mistaken for sound sources. The results suggest the brain separates sound into contributions from the source and the environment, constrained by a prior on natural reverberation. This separation process may contribute to robust recognition while providing information about spaces around us.},

abstract = {Based on anatomical and evolutionary conceptions of the human ear, an experiment was conducted in which forty-eight human subjects were asked to localize sounds (a human voice) emitted by one of twenty-seven stationary loudspeakers in an anechoic chamber. The position of the active loudspeaker varied with respect to azimuth, distance, and elevation in three steps each. The position of a single sound-reflecting surface (about 6 m2) was varied: on the floor, on the ceiling, to the left, and to the right. The accuracy of identifying the active loudspeaker for each position of the sound-reflecting surface was compared intraindividually with the absence of reflection. The results show an overall increase in correct localizations with a sound-reflecting surface on the floor. Especially the elevation of the sound source can be detected with greater precision. Additionally, the percentage of correct localizations decreased systematically with the presence of a sound-reflecting ceiling, while the presence of sound-reflecting walls did not systematically affect the localization performance. Judgments in the horizontal plane and those of distance were not systematically influenced by the presence of a sound-reflecting surface.},

abstract = {For human listeners, cues for vertical-plane localization are provided by direction-dependent pinna filtering. This study quantified listeners' weighting of the spectral cues from each ear as a function of stimulus lateral angle, interaural time difference (ITD), and interaural level difference (ILD). Subjects indicated the apparent position of headphone-presented noise bursts synthesized in virtual auditory space. The synthesis filters for the two ears either corresponded to the same location or to two different locations separated vertically by 20 deg. Weighting of each ear's spectral information was determined by a multiple regression between the elevations to which each ear's spectrum corresponded and the vertical component of listeners' responses. The apparent horizontal source location was controlled either by choosing synthesis filters corresponding to locations on or 30 deg left or right of the median plane or by attenuating or delaying the signal at one ear. For broadband stimuli, spectral weighting and apparent lateral angle were determined primarily by ITD. Only for high-pass stimuli were weighting and lateral angle determined primarily by ILD. The results suggest that the weighting of monaural spectral cues and the perceived lateral angle of a sound source depend similarly on ITD, ILD, and stimulus spectral range.},

The importance of using order overestimation, as well as of using an overdetermined set of equations, is emphasized. The Akaike information criterion is proposed for determining the equation order. A procedure for removing spurious noise modes based on modal decomposition of the sample covariance matrix is derived. The role of the singular value decomposition method in solving the modified Yule–Walker equations is discussed. A number of techniques for estimating MA spectral parameters are presented. {\textcopyright} 1984 IEEE},

SIRR analyzes the time-dependent direction of arrival and diffuseness of measured room responses within frequency bands. Based on the analysis data, a multichannel response suitable for reproduction with any chosen surround loudspeaker setup is synthesized. When loaded to a convolving reverberator, the synthesized responses create a very natural perception of space corresponding to the measured room. A technical description of the analysis-synthesis method is provided. Results of formal subjective evaluation and further analysis of SIRR are presented in a companion paper to be published in JAES in 2006 Jan./Feb.},

abstract = {Auralizations have become more prevalent in architectural acoustics and virtual reality. Studies have shown that by employing a methodical calibration procedure, ecologically/perceptually valid auraliza- tions can be obtained. Another study demonstrated a manner to include dynamic voice directivity with results indicating these auralizations were judged significantly more plausible than auralizations with static source orientations.With the increased plausibility of auralizations, it is possible to study room- acoustic experience employing virtual reality, having confidence that the results also apply to real-life situations. Limited studies have examined the influence of visuals on room-acoustic experience. Using a virtual reality framework, this study investigated the influence of visuals on the room-acoustic experi- ence of auralizations. Evaluations compared dynamic voice auralizations coherently matched with visualization positions to incoherentlymatched audio-visual pairs. Based on the results, the test popula- tion could be divided into three subgroups: (1) those who judged auralizationsmore acoustically distant with increased visual distance, (2) those who judged auralizations louder with increased visual dis- tance, and (3) those whose audio judgment was uninfluenced by the visual stimulus},

Both the basic elements of mathematical cognition (i.e. numbers) and the basic elements of musical cognition (i.e. pitches), appear to be mapped onto a mental spatial representation in a way that affects motor performance.},

abstract = {The goals of this study were to measure sensitivity to the direct-to-reverberant energy ratio (D/R) across a wide range of D/R values and to gain insight into which cues are used in the discrimination process. The main finding is that changes in D/R are discriminated primarily based on spectral cues. Temporal cues may be used but only when spectral cues are diminished or not available, while sensitivity to interaural cross-correlation is too low to be useful in any of the conditions tested. These findings are based on an acoustic analysis of these variables and the results of two psychophysical experiments. The first experiment employs wideband noise with two values for onset and offset times to determine the D/R just-noticeable difference at -10, 0, 10, and 20 dB D/R. This yielded substantially higher sensitivity to D/R at 0 and 10 dB D/R (2-3 dB) than has been reported previously, while sensitivity is much lower at -10 and 20 dB D/R. The second experiment consists of three parts where specific cues to D/R are reduced or removed, which enabled the specified rank ordering of the cues. The acoustic analysis and psychophysical experiments also provide an explanation for the "auditory horizon effect." {\textcopyright} 2008 Acoustical Society of America.},

abstract = {Geometrical acoustics are used as a standard model for room acoustic design and consulting. Research on room acoustic simulation focuses on a more accurate modeling of propagation effects such as diffraction and other wave effects in rooms, and on scattering. Much progress was made in this field so that wave models also (for example, the boundary element method and the finite differences in time domain) can now be used for higher frequencies. The concepts and implementations of room simulation methods are briefly reviewed. After all, simulations in architectural acoustics are indeed powerful tools, but their reliability depends on the skills of the operator who has to create an adequate polygon model and has to choose the correct input data of boundary conditions such as absorption and scattering. Very little is known about the uncertainty of this input data. With the theory of error propagation of uncertainties it can be shown that prediction of reverberation times with accuracy better than the just noticeable difference requires input data in a quality which is not available from reverberation room measurements.},

Reflection threshold data are useful in the context of building acoustics, since path length attenuation and absorption can make potential reflections Audibility headphone inaudible. of reflections is externalization. The information determining simulations engineering that desirable require for 3-D sound sound source is also useful for parameters for the real-time simulation of virtual acoustic environments, such as head- mounted displays that include head tracking.

abstract = {In this work, the influence of individual, generic and non-individual headphone compensation on the perceived quality of a binaural simulation was examined. Therefore, the binaural simulation, originating from recordings made with a hat and torso simulator (HATS), was compared to the corresponding real sound field radiated by a loudspeaker in two quality evaluating listening tests. Individual recordings were not considered. For this setup, non- individual headphone compensation turned out to be perceptively best suited, if it was based on headphone transfer functions measured on the same HATS. A true non-individual compensation, based on transfer functions from a third person however, was perceptively inferior to all other compensation approaches. Further, it was shown, that a subwoofer can be integrated into the binaural simulation, to enhance the playback of signals with strong low-frequency components, and that a minimum phase compensation, which might decrease the latency of the simulation, could be used without considerable perceptual degradation. For measuring individual binaural signals, a measurement instrument has been developed and evaluated in the course of this work.},

Measuring near-field data is possible, but would quickly become tiresome due to the large number of distances required to simulate sources moving close to the head. For applications requiring a convincing near-field virtual audio display, one could compensate the far-field HRTF filters with a scheme based on 1/r spreading roll off. However, this would not account for spectral differences that occur in the near-field. Using difference filters based on a spherical head model [1][2][3], as well as a geometrically accurate HRTF lookup scheme [4], one can compensate existing measured data and present a convincing virtual audio display for near-field distances},

abstract = {With miniature microphones inserted into the external ear canals of a model and the sound source 90° to left of midline, low-pass, and high-pass, broadband noise bursts were picked up and recorded on magnetic tape. The bursts were generated in 2 highly contrasting acoustic environments: an anechoic and an echoic chamber. The taped sounds were played back monaurally and binaurally via headphones to 16 experienced listeners seated in an acoustically neutral setting. They were instructed to estimate the distance of the stimuli. Apparent distances of bursts recorded in the echoic or reverberant chamber far exceeded those recorded in the anechoic chamber. Distance estimates were influenced dramatically by the frequency composition of the stimuli. Low-pass sounds recorded in either acoustic environment were consistently judged to be further removed than high-pass sounds recorded in the same setting. They were also more likely to appear from behind the listener. In our moment-to-moment transaction with the acoustic environment, distant sounds generally have less acoustic energy in the higher audio frequencies. It is suggested that this lifetime of auditory experience influenced the listeners' scale of relative distance. (8 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {Hearing-aid wearers have reported sound source locations as being perceptually internalized (i.e., inside their head). The contribution of hearing-aid design to internalization has, however, received little attention. This experiment compared the sensitivity of hearing-impaired (HI) and normal-hearing listeners to externalization cues when listening with their own ears and simulated behind-the-ear hearing-aids in increasingly complex listening situations and reduced pinna cues. Participants rated the degree of externalization using a multiple-stimulus listening test for mixes of internalized and externalized speech stimuli presented over headphones. The results showed that HI listeners had a contracted perception of externalization correlated with high-frequency hearing loss.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Acoustical Society of America.Head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) can be numerically calculated by applying the boundary element method on the geometry of a listener's head and pinnae. The calculation results are defined by geometrical, numerical, and acoustical parameters like the microphone used in acoustic measurements. The scope of this study was to estimate requirements on the size and position of the microphone model and on the discretization of the boundary geometry as triangular polygon mesh for accurate sound localization. The evaluation involved the analysis of localization errors predicted by a sagittal-plane localization model, the comparison of equivalent head radii estimated by a time-of-arrival model, and the analysis of actual localization errors obtained in a sound-localization experiment. While the average edge length (AEL) of the mesh had a negligible effect on localization performance in the lateral dimension, the localization performance in sagittal planes, however, degraded for larger AELs with the geometrical error as dominant factor. A microphone position at an arbitrary position at the entrance of the ear canal, a microphone size of 1 mm radius, and a mesh with 1 mm AEL yielded a localization performance similar to or better than observed with acoustically measured HRTFs.},

@article{Liu2019,
abstract = {Recently, a modeling method for head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) in the spatial domain is proposed based on spherical wavelets. Because spherical wavelets are local functions on the sphere, HRTF local features can be efficiently represented by using a small number of analysis functions. This sparse representation method enables to control the spatial resolutions of a desired local region on the sphere with the expansion coefficients. Meanwhile, the conventional HRTF spatial variations models based on spherical harmonic decomposition, which is able to represent the HRTF coarse structure well with lower order models. In this paper, a modeling method of the HRTF spatial features is proposed by combining the spherical harmonics and spherical wavelets, which represents the coarse structure and spatial detail of the HRTFs, respectively. The numerical experiment results show that the proposed joint modeling method has smaller approximation errors within the frequency range of 7 kHz compared with 15 orders spherical harmonics modeling when the same number of parameters is used for representing the HRTF magnitude in all directions. In the comparisons with higher orders spherical harmonics modeling, the proposed joint modeling method yields smaller approximation errors within the frequency range of 20 kHz. Furthermore, the proposed joint modeling method is expected to help interpret the spatial cues in which the low orders spherical harmonic coefficients corresponds to head shadow effects while the spherical wavelet coefficients corresponding to the residual finer details may be interpreted as pinna effects. A tool for the HRTF spatial feature extraction is provided in this paper.},

abstract = {A basic building block of audio for Augmented Reality(AR) is the use of virtual sound sources layered on topof real sources present in an environment. In order toperceive these virtual sources as belonging to the naturalscene it is important to carefully replicate the room acous-tics of the listening space. However, it is unclear to whatextent the real and virtual room impulse responses (RIR)need to be matched in order to generate plausible scenesin which virtual sound sources blend seamlessly with realsound sources. This contribution presents an auralizationframework that allows binaural rendering, manipulationand reproduction of room acoustics in augmented realityscenarios, in order to get a better understanding of theperceptual relevance of individual room acoustic param-eters. Auralizations are generated from measured multi-channel room impulse responses (MRIR) parametrized us-ing the Spatial Decomposition Method (SDM). An alter-native method to correct the known time-dependent col-oration of SDM based auralizations is presented. Instru-mental validation shows that re-synthesized binaural roomimpulse responses (BRIRs) are in close agreement withmeasured BRIRs. In situ perceptual validation with ex-pert listeners show that - in the presence of visual cues, anexplicit sound reference and unlimited listening time, theyare able to discriminate between a real loudspeaker and itsre-synthesized version. However, the renderings appear tobe as plausible as a real source once visual cues are re-moved. Finally, approaches to manipulate the spatial andtime-energy properties of the auralizations are presented.},

abstract = {Sound localization studies over the past century have predominantly been concerned with directional accuracy for far-field sources. Few studies have examined the condition of near-field sources and distance perception. The current study concerns localization and pointing accuracy by examining source positions in the peripersonal space, specifically those associated with a typical tabletop surface. Accuracy is studied with respect to the reporting hand (dominant or secondary) for auditory sources. Results show no effect on the reporting hand with azimuthal errors increasing equally for the most extreme source positions. Distance errors show a consistent compression toward the center of the reporting area. A second evaluation is carried out comparing auditory and visual stimuli to examine any bias in reporting protocol or biomechanical difficulties. No common bias error was observed between auditory and visual stimuli indicating that reporting errors were not due to biomechanical limitations in the pointing task. A final evaluation compares real auditory sources and anechoic condition virtual sources created using binaural rendering. Results showed increased azimuthal errors, with virtual source positions being consistently overestimated to more lateral positions, while no significant distance perception was observed, indicating a deficiency in the binaural rendering condition relative to the real stimuli situation. Various potential reasons for this discrepancy are discussed with several proposals for improving distance perception in peripersonal virtual environments.},

This paper summarises the current literature following a top-down approach. It identifies the perceptual aspects of reverberation and attempts to establish links to physical measures, focussing on small rooms. Results indicate that the current acoustical metrics often have limited correlation to the perceptual attributes of reverberation and conclusive measurement data is restricted, especially for small spaces.

abstract = {The auditory system allows the estimation of the distance to sound-emitting objects using multiple spatial cues. In virtual acoustics over headphones, a prerequisite to render auditory distance impression is sound externalization, which denotes the perception of synthesized stimuli outside of the head. Prior studies have found that listeners with mild-to-moderate hearing loss are able to perceive auditory distance and are sensitive to externalization. However, this ability may be degraded by certain factors, such as non-linear amplification in hearing aids or the use of a remote wireless microphone. In this study, 10 normal-hearing and 20 moderate-to-profound hearing-impaired listeners were instructed to estimate the distance of stimuli processed with different methods yielding various perceived auditory distances in the vicinity of the listeners. Two different configurations of non-linear amplification were implemented, and a novel feature aiming to restore a sense of distance in wireless microphone systems was tested. The results showed that the hearing-impaired listeners, even those with a profound hearing loss, were able to discriminate nearby and far sounds that were equalized in level. Their perception of auditory distance was however more contracted than in normal-hearing listeners. Non-linear amplification was found to distort the original spatial cues, but no adverse effect on the ratings of auditory distance was evident. Finally, it was shown that the novel feature was successful in allowing the hearing-impaired participants to perceive externalized sounds with wireless microphone systems.},

abstract = {A method is proposed for automatically regularizing the inversion of a headphone transfer function for headphone equalization. The method estimates the amount of regularization by comparing the measured response before and after half-octave smoothing. Therefore the regularization depends exclusively on the headphone response. The method combines the accuracy of the conventional regularized inverse method in inverting the measured response with the perceptual robustness of inversion using the smoothing method at the notch frequencies. A perceptual evaluation is carried out to confirm the efficacy of the proposed method for obtaining perceptually acceptable automatic regularization for equalizing headphones for binaural reproduction applications. The results show that the proposed method can produce perceptually better equalization than the regularized inverse method used with a fixed regularization factor or the complex smoothing method used with a half-octave smoothing window.},

abstract = {A listening experiment is presented in which subjects rated the perceived differences in terms of spaciousness and timbre between a headphone-based headtracked dummy head auralization of a sound source in different rooms and a headphone-based headtracked auralization of a spherical microphone array recording of the same scenario. The underlying auralizations were based on mea- sured impulse responses to assure equal conditions. Rigid-sphere arrays with different amounts of microphones ranging from 50 to up to 1202 were emulated through sequential measurements, and spherical harmonics orders of up to 12 were tested. The results show that the array auralizations are partially indistinguishable from the direct dummy head auralization at a spherical harmonics order of 8 or higher if the virtual sound source is located at a lateral position. No significant reduction of the perceived differences with increasing order is observed for frontal virtual sound sources. In this case, small differences with respect to both spaciousness and timbre persist. The evaluation of lowpass-filtered stimuli shows that the perceived differences occur exclusively at higher frequen- cies and can therefore be attributed to spatial aliasing. The room had only a minor effect on the results.},

The possibly confounding influence of changes in the sound level and/or loudness of the stimuli were also explored. Three experiments were conducted with a total of 226 Ss. Results indicate that a decrease in high-frequency content (as might physically be produced by passage through a greater amount of air) led to increases in perceived auditory distance, but only when compared with similar sounds having a somewhat different high-frequency content. Thus, spectral information can serve as a relative cue for auditory distance, independent of changes in overall sound level. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

The resulting image-sources can be used for room acoustics analysis and for multichannel convo- lution reverberation engines. The analysis method is applicable for any compact microphone array and the reproduction can be realized with any of the current spatial reproduction methods. Listening test experiments with simulated impulse responses show that the proposed method produces an auralization indistinguishable from the reference in the best case.},

abstract = {Different methods of modeling reverberation tails of binaural room impulse responses (BRIRs) are investigated. The interaural coherence as a function of time and frequency is identified as an important measure describing the interaural properties of BRIR tails. Synthetic BRIR tails were generated based on white Gaussian noise filtered to match the energy decay relief (EDR) and the interaural coherence (IC) of the original BRIR tails. Different methods of IC matching were applied and the EDR was sufficiently smoothed in time to avoid modeling the temporal envelope variations due to early reflections. A subjective test was carried out to investigate the perceived difference between original BRIRs and BRIRs with modeled tails starting at different split points, that is, considering none or various early reflections, and to study the influence of frequency-dependent interaural coherence matching compared to frequency-independent IC matching. A second subjective test was performed to investigate the potential for improvement in the case when no early reflections are taken from the original BRIR and the tails are modeled considering also the time dependence of the interaural coherence},

abstract = {The perception of spatially distributed sound sources was investigated by conducting two listening experiments in anechoic conditions with 13 loudspeakers evenly distributed in the frontal horizontal plane emitting incoherent noise signals. In the first experiment, widely distributed sound sources with gaps in their distribution emitted pink noise. The results indicated that the exact loudspeaker distribution could not be perceived accurately and that the width of the distribution was perceived to be narrower than it was in reality. Up to three spatially distributed loudspeakers that were simultaneously emitting sound could be individually perceived. In addition, the number of loudspeakers that were indicated as emitting sound was smaller than the actual number. In the second experiment, a reference with 13 loudspeakers and test cases with fewer loudspeakers were presented and their perceived spatial difference was rated. The effect of the noise bandwidth was of particular interest. Noise with different bandwidths centered around 500 and 4000 Hz was used. The results indicated that when the number of loudspeakers was increased from four to seven, the perceived auditory event was very similar to that perceived with 13 loudspeakers at all bandwidths. The perceived differences were larger in wideband noise than in narrow-band noise.},

abstract = {The benefit of using individual head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) in binaural audio is well documented with regards to improving localization precision. However, with the increased use of binaural audio in more complex scene renderings, cognitive studies, and virtual and augmented reality simulations, the perceptual impact of HRTF selection may go beyond simple localization. In this study, the authors develop a list of attributes which qualify the perceived differences between HRTFs, providing a qualitative understanding of the perceptual variance of non-individual binaural renderings. The list of attributes was designed using a Consensus Vocabulary Protocol elicitation method. Participants followed an Individual Vocabulary Protocol elicitation procedure, describing the perceived differences between binaural stimuli based on binauralized extracts of multichannel productions. This was followed by an automated lexical reduction and a series of consensus group meetings during which participants agreed on a list of relevant attributes. Finally, the proposed list of attributes was then evaluated through a listening test, leading to eight valid perceptual attributes for describing the perceptual dimensions affected by HRTF set variations.},

abstract = {Head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) capture the free-field sound transmission from a sound source to the listeners ears, incorporating all the cues for sound localization, such as interaural time and level differences as well as the spectral cues that originate from scattering, diffraction, and reflection on the human pinnae, head, and body. In this study, HRTFs were acoustically measured and numerically simulated for the FABIAN head-and-torso simulator on a full-spherical and high-resolution sampling grid. HRTFs were acquired for 11 horizontal head-above-torso orientations, covering the typical range of motion of +/-50°. This made it possible to account for head movements in dynamic binaural auralizations. Because of a lack of an external reference for the HRTFs, measured and simulated data sets were cross-validated by applying auditory models for localization performance and spectral coloration. The results indicate a high degree of similarity between the two data sets regarding all tested aspects, thus suggesting that they are free of systematic errors.},

abstract = {Previous studies have shown that the accuracy of sound localization is improved if listeners are allowed to move their heads during signal presentation. This study describes the function relating localization accuracy to the extent of head movement in azimuth. Sounds that are difficult to localize were presented in the free field from sources at a wide range of azimuths and elevations. Sounds remained active until the participants' heads had rotated through windows ranging in width of 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64° of azimuth. Error in determining sound-source elevation and the rate of front/back confusion were found to decrease with increases in azimuth window width. Error in determining sound-source lateral angle was not found to vary with azimuth window width. Implications for 3-d audio displays: the utility of a 3-d audio display for imparting spatial information is likely to be improved if operators are able to move their heads during signal presentation. Head movement may compensate in part for a paucity of spectral cues to sound-source location resulting from limitations in either the audio signals presented or the directional filters (i.e., head-related transfer functions) used to generate a display. However, head movements of a moderate size (i.e., through around 32° of azimuth) may be required to ensure that spatial information is conveyed with high accuracy.},

abstract = {Room acoustics computer modeling is a tool for generating impulse responses and auralizations from modeled spaces. The auralizations are commonly made from a single-channel anechoic recording of solo instruments. For this investigation, auralizations of an entire orchestra were created using a multi-channel multi-source auralization technique, involving individual five-channel anechoic recordings of each instrumental part of two symphonies. In the first study, these auralizations were subjectively compared to orchestra auralizations made using (a) a single omni-directional source, (b) a surface source, and (c) single-channel multi-source method. Results show that the multi-source auralizations were rated to be more realistic than the surface source ones and to have larger source width than the single omni-directional source auralizations. No significant differences were found between the one- and five-channel multi-source auralizations, though. In a second subjective study, one- and five-channel multi-source auralizations were created for three different orchestra configurations: "contemporary", with the first and second violin sections seated adjacent to each other; "traditional", with the first and second violin sections seated across from each other; and "random", with the various instrument sections mixed across the stage. Subjects were generally able to distinguish between these orchestra configurations when listening to the multi-source auralizations; however, in one instance, subjects could only discern differences between the orchestra configurations with the five-channel multi-source auralizations. Overall, the multi-source auralization technique was found to be an effective method for creating realistic orchestra auralizations, but using multichannel anechoic recordings with the multi-source method was not found to be a consistent advantage in all cases.},

@article{Brinkmann2015,
abstract = {Head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) incorporate fundamental cues required for human spatial hearing and are often applied to auralize results obtained from room acoustic simulations. HRTFs are typically available for various directions of sound incidence and a fixed head-above-torso orientation (HATO). If – in interactive auralizations – HRTFs are exchanged according to the head rotations of a listener, the auralization result most often corresponds to a listener turning head and torso simultaneously, while – in reality – listeners usually turn their head independently above a fixed torso. In the present study, we show that accounting for HATO produces clearly audible differences, thereby suggesting the relevance of correct HATO when aiming at perceptually transparent binaural synthesis. Furthermore, we addressed the efficient representation of variable HATO in interactive acoustic simulations using spatial interpolation. Hereby, we evaluated two different approaches: interpolating between HRTFs with identical torso-to-source but different head-to-source orientations (head interpolation) and interpolating between HRTFs with the same head-to-source but different torso-to-source orientations (torso interpolation). Torso interpolation turned out to be more robust against increasing interpolation step width. In this case the median threshold of audibility for the head-above-torso resolution was about 25 degrees, whereas with head interpolation the threshold was about 10 degrees. Additionally, we tested a non-interpolation approach (nearest neighbor) as a suitable means for mobile applications with limited computational capacities.},

The present study investigated the role of these two cues in contralateral and ipsilateral ear signals on perceived externalization of headphone-reproduced binaural sound images at different azimuth angles. For this purpose, seven pairs of non-individual binaural room impulse responses (BRIRs) were measured at azimuth angles of −90°, −60°, −30°, 0°, 30°, 60°, and 90° in a listening room. The magnitude spectra of direct parts were smoothed, and the reverberation was removed, either in left or right ear BRIRs. Such modified BRIRs were convolved with a speech signal, and the resulting binaural sounds were presented over headphones. Subjects were asked to assess the degree of perceived externalization for the presented stimuli. The result of the subjective listening experiment revealed that the magnitude spectra of direct parts in ipsilateral ear signals and the reverberation in contralateral ear signals are important for perceived externalization of virtual lateral sound sources.},

abstract = {In the context of geometric acoustic simulation, one of the more perceptually important yet difficult to simulate acoustic effects is diffraction, a phenomenon that allows sound to propagate around obstructions and corners. A significant bottleneck in real-time simulation of diffraction is the enumeration of high-order diffraction propagation paths in scenes with complex geometry (e.g. highly tessellated surfaces). To this end, we present a dynamic geometric diffraction approach that consists of an extensive mesh preprocessing pipeline and complementary runtime algorithm. The preprocessing module identifies a small subset of edges that are important for diffraction using a novel silhouette edge detection heuristic. It also extends these edges with planar diffraction geometry and precomputes a graph data structure encoding the visibility between the edges. The runtime module uses bidirectional path tracing against the diffraction geometry to probabilistically explore potential paths between sources and listeners, then evaluates the intensities for these paths using the Uniform Theory of Diffraction. It uses the edge visibility graph and the A∗pathfinding algorithm to robustly and efficiently find additional high-order diffraction paths. We demonstrate how this technique can simulate 10th-order diffraction up to 568 times faster than the previous state of the art, and can efficiently handle large scenes with both high geometric complexity and high numbers of sources.},

abstract = {The ability of human listeners to identify broadband noises differing in spectral structure was studied for multiple sound-source locations in the median sagittal plane. The purpose of the study was to understand how sound identification is affected by spectral variations caused by directionally dependent head-related transfer functions. It was found that listeners could accurately identify noises with different spectral peaks and valleys when the source location was fixed. Listeners could also identify noises when the source location was roved in the median sagittal plane when the relevant spectral features were at low frequency. Listeners failed to identify noises with roved location when the spectral structure was at high frequency, presumably because the spectral structure was confused with the spectral variations caused by different locations. Parallel experiments on sound localization showed that listeners can localize noises that they cannot identify. The combination of identification and localization experiments leads to the conclusion that listeners cannot compensate for directionally dependent filtering by their own heads when they try to identify sounds.},

We recorded whole-scalp neuromagnetic responses to such stimuli to compare reactivity of the human auditory cortex to sound azimuth and elevation. The results suggest that the human auditory cortex analyses sound azimuth, based on both binaural and monaural localization cues, mainly in the hemisphere contralateral to the sound, whereas elevation in the anterior space and in the lateral auditory space in general, both strongly relying on monaural spectral cues, are analyzed in more detail in the right auditory cortex. The binaural interaural time and interaural intensity difference cues were processed in the auditory cortex around 100-150 ms and the monaural spectral cues later around 200-250 ms.},

abstract = {It is in most cases relatively easy to understand one talker even if other persons are talking at the same time. Over the last decades, this so-called cocktail party phenomenon has been the subject of a considerable number of studies. In the present paper, an overview is given of part of this research, specifically those studies dealing with the intelligibility of speech presented against a background of competing speech. In the first section of the review, the properties of speech are considered that are relevant when it acts as an interfering sound: the long-term average frequency spectrum, and the modulation spectrum. In the middle sections, speech intelligibility data are reviewed for monaural and binaural listening and with one or multiple interfering voices (or speech-like sounds). It appears from these data that speech intelligibility depends in a complex manner on the properties of the interfering signal(s), the number of signals, the spatial configuration of the sources, and the acoustic environment. This dependency can be predicted in part by existing models. For the prediction of effects of voice similarity and interferer modulations, however, no suitable models are available. The fifth section of the review is devoted to research on effects of hearing impairment and the use of hearing aids. These studies demonstrate that speech intelligibility in conditions involving interfering speech is significantly poorer for the average hearing-impaired listener than for the normal hearing. Hearing aids can only be effective when they yield both selective amplification and an increase of the signal-to-noise ratio at the ears (e.g. by using directional microphones). The review ends by pointing out areas of interest for future research.},

However, a thorough understanding of the reason why VR is effective and what effect it has on the human psyche is still missing. Most research on this subject is related to the concept of presence. This paper gives an up-to-date overview of research in this diverse field. It starts with the most prevailing definitions and theories on presence, most of which attribute special roles for the mental process of attention and for mental models of the virtual space. A review of the phenomena thought to be effected by presence shows that there is still a strong need for research on this subject because little conclusive evidence exists regarding the relationship between presence and phenoma such as emotional responses to virtual stimuli. An investigation shows there has been substantial research for developing methods for measuring presence and research regarding factors that contribute to presence. Knowledge of these contribut...},

abstract = {Sounds heard over headphones are typically perceived inside the head (internalized), unlike real sound sources which are perceived outside the head (externalized). If the acoustical waveforms from a real sound source are reproduced precisely using headphones, auditory images are appropriately externalized and localized. The filtering (relative boosting, attenuation and delaying of component frequencies) of a sound by the head and outer ear provides information about the location of a sound source by means of the differences in the frequency spectra between the ears as well as the overall spectral shape. This location-dependent filtering is explicitly described by the head-related transfer function (HRTF) from sound source to ear canal. Here we present sounds to subjects through open-canal tube-phones and investigate how accurately the HRTFs must be reproduced to achieve true three-dimensional perception of auditory signals in anechoic space. Listeners attempted to discriminate between 'real' sounds presented from a loudspeaker and 'virtual' sounds presented over tube-phones. Our results show that the HRTFs can be smoothed significantly in frequency without affecting the perceived location of a sound. Listeners cannot distinguish real from virtual sources until the HRTF has lost most of its detailed variation in frequency, at which time the perceived elevation of the image is the reported cue.},

abstract = {The primary goal of this article is to promote awareness of the various statistical problems associated with the use of p value null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST). Making no claim of completeness, I review three prob-lems with NHST, briefly explaining their causes and con-sequences (see Karabatsos, 2006). The discussion of each problem is accompanied by concrete examples and refer-ences to the statistical literature. In the psychological literature, the pros and cons of NHST have been, and continue to be, hotly debated The issues that have dominated the NHST discussion in the psychological lit-erature are that (1) NHST tempts the user into confusing the probability of the hypothesis given the data with the probability of the data given the hypothesis; (2) (.05 is an arbitrary criterion for significance; and (3) in real-world applications, the null hypothesis is never exactly true, and will therefore always be rejected as the number of observations grows large. In the statistical literature, the pros and cons of NHST are also the topic of an ongoing dispute (e. A comparison of these two literatures shows that in psychology, the NHST discussion has focused mostly on problems of interpretation, whereas in statistics, the NHST discussion has focused mostly on problems of for-mal construction. The statistical perspective on the prob-lems associated with NHST is therefore fundamentally different from the psychological perspective. In this ar-ticle, the goal is to explain NHST and its problems from a statistical perspective. Many psychologists are oblivious to certain statistical problems associated with NHST, and the examples below show that this ignorance can have im-portant ramifications. In this article, I will show that an NHST p value de-pends on data that were never observed: The p value is a tail-area integral, and this integral is effectively over data that are not observed but only hypothesized. The prob-ability of these hypothesized data depends crucially on the possibly unknown subjective intentions of the researcher who carried out the experiment. If these intentions were to be ignored, a user of NHST could always obtain a sig-nificant result through optional stopping (i.e., analyzing the data as they accumulate and stopping the experiment whenever the p value reaches some desired significance level). In the context of NHST, it is therefore necessary to know the subjective intention with which an experi-ment was carried out. This key requirement is unattain-able in a practical sense, and arguably undesirable in a philosophical sense. In addition, I will review a proof that the NHST p value does not measure statistical evidence. In order for the p value to qualify as a measure of statisti-cal evidence, a minimum requirement is that identical p values convey identical levels of evidence, irrespective},

abstract = {An audience{\&}apos;s auditory experience during a thrilling and emotive live symphony concert is an intertwined combination of the music and the acoustic response of the concert hall. Music in itself is known to elicit emotional pleasure, and at best, listening to music may evoke concrete psychophysiological responses. Certain concert halls have gained a reputation for superior acoustics, but despite the continuous research by a multitude of objective and subjective studies on room acoustics, the fundamental reason for the appreciation of some concert halls remains elusive. This study demonstrates that room acousticeffects contribute to the overall emotional experience of a musical performance. In two listening tests, the subjects listen to identical orchestra performances rendered in the acoustics of several concert halls. The emotional excitation during listening is measured in the first experiment, and in the second test, the subjects assess the experienced subjective impact by paired comparisons. The results showed that the sound of some traditional rectangular halls provides greater psychophysiological responses and subjective impact. These findings provide a quintessential explanation for these halls{\&}apos; success and reveal the overall significance of room acoustics for emotional experience in music performance.},

@phdthesis{Patynen2011,
abstract = {Traditionally, concert hall acoustics is evaluated by listening to live concerts, which makes a direct comparison challenging. This thesis presents new tools and methods in the domain of the room acoustics evaluation, studies, and auralization. Auralization stands for the process of rendering an existing or modeled acoustic space in a way that it can be presented to the listener as he/she was listening to a sound inside the space under study. An essential topic in this thesis is a framework for studying room acoustics with a wide-area loudspeaker array. The proposed loudspeaker orchestra consists of a number of loudspeakers that are positioned in the shape resembling a symphony orchestra on a stage. The acoustics can be evaluated in-situ by playing back anechoic signals, or in laboratory conditions via convolution of the impulse responses measured from the loudspeaker orchestra. The presented method enables a direct comparison of concert halls and it has been successfully applied in practice in several research articles. The principal requirement for such a loudspeaker orchestra is anechoic signals of high quality. For this purpose, a method and implementation of a system for recording the symphony orchestra instruments individually is presented. As the result, a selection of anechoic orchestral music is obtained with perfect channel separation. The recordings, intended for advancing the research on acoustics and auralization, are published for academic use. Directivity of the orchestra instruments in performance situation is investigated with anechoic measurements. The results for different instruments can be compared against each other or applied directly into auralizations. Data from the directivity measurements is also applied in the objective analysis of the presented loudspeaker orchestra. Furthermore, the implemented measurement system is utilized in investigating the sound radiation of the balloons, which are often used in room acoustic measurements. Related to the anechoic recordings, a novel approach to creating an impression of a group of musicians from a single recorded player is proposed. The method is mainly based on the video and audio analysis of the temporal differences between orchestra string players. The method is particularly beneficial with the anechoic recordings, where recording an instrument section is not possible, and recording a large number of musicians individually is time-consuming. The listening test results show that the presented method provides a plausible simulation of an instrument section sound in comparison to an industry-standard method.},

abstract = {Head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) capture the direction-dependant way that sound interacts with the head and torso. In virtual audio systems, which aim to emulate these effects, non-individualized, generic HRTFs are typically used leading to an inaccurate perception of virtual sound location. Training has the potential to exploit the brain's ability to adapt to these unfamiliar cues. In this study, three virtual sound localization training paradigms were evaluated; one provided simple visual positional confirmation of sound source location, a second introduced game design elements (“gamification”) and a final version additionally utilized head-tracking to provide listeners with experience of relative sound source motion (“active listening”). The results demonstrate a significant effect of training after a small number of short (12-minute) training sessions, which is retained across multiple days. Gamification alone had no significant effect on the efficacy of the training, but active listening resulted in a significantly greater improvements in localization accuracy. In general, improvements in virtual sound localization following training generalized to a second set of non-individualized HRTFs, although some HRTF-specific changes were observed in polar angle judgement for the active listening group. The implications of this on the putative mechanisms of the adaptation process are discussed.},

abstract = {The efficacy of a sound localization training procedure that provided listeners with auditory, visual, and proprioceptive/vestibular feedback as to the correct sound-source position was evaluated using a virtual auditory display that used nonindividualized head-related transfer functions (HRTFs). Under these degraded stimulus conditions, in which the monaural spectral cues to sound-source direction were inappropriate, localization accuracy was initially poor with frequent front-back reversals (source localized to the incorrect front-back hemifield) for five of six listeners. Short periods of training (two 30-min sessions) were found to significantly reduce the rate of front-back reversal responses for four of five listeners that showed high initial reversal rates. Reversal rates remained unchanged for all listeners in a control group that did not participate in the training procedure. Because analyses of the HRTFs used in the display demonstrated a simple and robust front-back cue related to energy in the 3-7-kHz bandwidth, it is suggested that the reductions observed in reversal rates following the training procedure resulted from improved processing of this front-back cue, which is perhaps a form of rapid perceptual recalibration. Reversal rate reductions were found to generalize to untrained source locations, and persisted at least 4 months following the training procedure.},

abstract = {Bayes factors have been advocated as superior to p-values for assessing statistical evidence in data. Despite the advantages of Bayes factors and the drawbacks of p-values, inference by p-values is still nearly ubiquitous. One impediment to the adoption of Bayes factors is a lack of practical development, particularly a lack of ready-to-use formulas and algorithms. In this paper, we discuss and expand a set of default Bayes factor tests for ANOVA designs. These tests are based on multivariate generalizations of Cauchy priors on standardized effects, and have the desirable properties of being invariant with respect to linear transformations of measurement units. Moreover, these Bayes factors are computationally convenient, and straightforward sampling algorithms are provided. We cover models with fixed, random, and mixed effects, including random interactions, and do so for within-subject, between-subject, and mixed designs. We extend the discussion to regression models with continuous covariates. We also discuss how these Bayes factors may be applied in nonlinear settings, and show how they are useful in differentiating between the power law and the exponential law of skill acquisition. In sum, the current development makes the computation of Bayes factors straightforward for the vast majority of designs in experimental psychology. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

The objective measures considered a wide range of distortions introduced by four types of real-world noise at two signal-to-noise ratio levels by four classes of speech enhancement algorithms: spectral subtractive, subspace, statistical-model based, and Wiener algorithms. The subjective quality ratings were obtained using the ITU-T P.835 methodology designed to evaluate the quality of enhanced speech along three dimensions: signal distortion, noise distortion, and overall quality. This paper reports on the evaluation of correlations of several objective measures with these three subjective rating scales. Several new composite objective measures are also proposed by combining the individual objective measures using nonparametric and parametric regression analysis techniques.},

abstract = {Background: We physically interact with external stimuli when they occur within a limited space immediately surrounding the body, i.e., Peripersonal Space (PPS). In the primate brain, specific fronto-parietal areas are responsible for the multisensory representation of PPS, by integrating tactile, visual and auditory information occurring on and near the body. Dynamic stimuli are particularly relevant for PPS representation, as they might refer to potential harms approaching the body. However, behavioural tasks for studying PPS representation with moving stimuli are lacking. Here we propose a new dynamic audio-tactile interaction task in order to assess the extension of PPS in a more functionally and ecologically valid condition. Methodology/Principal Findings: Participants vocally responded to a tactile stimulus administered at the hand at different delays from the onset of task-irrelevant dynamic sounds which gave the impression of a sound source either approaching or receding from the subject's hand. Results showed that a moving auditory stimulus speeded up the processing of a tactile stimulus at the hand as long as it was perceived at a limited distance from the hand, that is within the boundaries of PPS representation. The audio-tactile interaction effect was stronger when sounds were approaching compared to when sounds were receding. Conclusion/Significance: This study provides a new method to dynamically assess PPS representation: The function describing the relationship between tactile processing and the position of sounds in space can be used to estimate the location of PPS boundaries, along a spatial continuum between far and near space, in a valuable and ecologically significant way. {\textcopyright} 2012 Canzoneri et al.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Spiousas, Etchemendy, Eguia, Calcagno, Abreg{\'{u}} and Vergara.Previous studies on the effect of spectral content on auditory distance perception (ADP) focused on the physically measurable cues occurring either in the near field (low-pass filtering due to head diffraction) or when the sound travels distances {\textgreater} 15 m (high-frequency energy losses due to air absorption). Here, we study how the spectrum of a sound arriving from a source located in a reverberant room at intermediate distances (1-6 m) influences the perception of the distance to the source. First, we conducted an ADP experiment using pure tones (the simplest possible spectrum) of frequencies 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz. Then, we performed a second ADP experiment with stimuli consisting of continuous broadband and bandpass-filtered (with center frequencies of 0.5, 1.5, and 4 kHz and bandwidths of 1/12, 1/3, and 1.5 octave) pink-noise clips. Our results showed an effect of the stimulus frequency on the perceived distance both for pure tones and filtered noise bands: ADP was less accurate for stimuli containing energy only in the low-frequency range. Analysis of the frequency response of the room showed that the low accuracy observed for low-frequency stimuli can be explained by the presence of sparse modal resonances in the low-frequency region of the spectrum, which induced a non-monotonic relationship between binaural intensity and source distance. The results obtained in the second experiment suggest that ADP can also be affected by stimulus bandwidth but in a less straightforward way (i.e., depending on the center frequency, increasing stimulus bandwidth could have different effects). Finally, the analysis of the acoustical cues suggests that listeners judged source distance using mainly changes in the overall intensity of the auditory stimulus with distance rather than the direct-to-reverberant energy ratio, even for low-frequency noise bands (which typically induce high amount of reverberation). The results obtained in this study show that, depending on the spectrum of the auditory stimulus, reverberation can degrade ADP rather than improve it.},

abstract = {Background:Previous findings have shown that humans can learn to localize with altered auditory space cues. Here we analyze such learning processes and their effects up to one month on both localization accuracy and sound externalization. Subjects were trained and retested, focusing on the effects of stimulus type in learning, stimulus type in localization, stimulus position, previous experience, externalization levels, and time.Method:We trained listeners in azimuth and elevation discrimination in two experiments. Half participated in the azimuth experiment first and half in the elevation first. In each experiment, half were trained in speech sounds and half in white noise. Retests were performed at several time intervals: just after training and one hour, one day, one week and one month later. In a control condition, we tested the effect of systematic retesting over time with post-tests only after training and either one day, one week, or one month later.Results:With training all participants lowered their localization errors. This benefit was still present one month after training. Participants were more accurate in the second training phase, revealing an effect of previous experience on a different task. Training with white noise led to better results than training with speech sounds. Moreover, the training benefit generalized to untrained stimulus-position pairs. Throughout the post-tests externalization levels increased. In the control condition the long-term localization improvement was not lower without additional contact with the trained sounds, but externalization levels were lower.Conclusion:Our findings suggest that humans adapt easily to altered auditory space cues and that such adaptation spreads to untrained positions and sound types. We propose that such learning depends on all available cues, but each cue type might be learned and retrieved differently. The process of localization learning is global, not limited to stimulus-position pairs, and it differs from externalization processes. {\textcopyright} 2013 Mendon{\c{c}}a et al.},

abstract = {In this work the importance of individualization in binaural technique is investigated. The results extend the present knowledge on the efficient measurement of individual head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) and highlight the importance of individual equalization filters in binaural reproduction, using both loudspeakers and headphones. Moreover, an integrated framework for the calculation of such equalization filters is presented. An innovative measurement setup was developed to allow the fast acquisition of individual HRTFs. The hardware was designed to be compatible with the range extrapolation technique. An individual HRTF dataset with 4000 directions can be measured in less than 6 minutes with this new setup. A framework was presented that integrates causality constraints to the regularized frequency domain calculation of crosstalk cancellation (CTC) filter. This framework also addresses the switching of active loudspeakers applying a weighted filter calculation method. A sound localization test showed that individualized CTC systems provide performance similar to that of binaural listening while nonindividualized CTC systems provide a significantly lower localization performance. Finally, a robust individual headphone equalization method was proposed. Perceptual tests showed that, in all but one of the tested situations, no audible differences between the original sound source and its binaural auditory display could be perceived.},

abstract = {Sensitivity to changes in the intensity of a random noise was determined over a wide range of intensities. The just detectable increment in the intensity of the noise is of the same order of magnitude as the just detectable increment in the intensity of pure tones. For intensities more than 30 db above the threshold of hearing for noise the size in decibels of the increment which can be heard 50 percent of the time is approximately constant (0.41 db). When the results of the experiment are regarded as measures of the masking of a noise by the noise itself, it can be shown that functions which describe intensity discrimination also describe the masking by white noise of pure tones and of speech. It is argued, therefore, that the determination of differential sensitivity to intensity is a special case of the more general masking experiment. The loudness of the noise was also determined, and just noticeable differences are shown to be unequal in subjective magnitude. A just noticeable difference at a low intensity produces a much smaller change in the apparent loudness than does a just noticeable difference at a high intensity.},

If an auditory scene consists of many spatially separated sound sources, how many sound sources can be processed by the auditory system? Experiment I determined how many speech sources could be localized simultaneously on the azimuth plane. Different words were played from multiple loudspeakers, and listeners reported the total number of sound sources and their individual locations. In experiment II the accuracy of localizing one speech source in a mixture of multiple speech sources was determined. An extra sound source was added to an existing set of sound sources, and the task was to localize that extra source. In experiment III the setup and task were the same as in experiment I, except that the sounds were tones. The results showed that the maximum number of sound sources that listeners could perceive was limited to approximately four spatially separated speech signals and three for tonal signals. The localization errors increased along with the increase of total number of sound sources. When four or more speech sources already existed, the accuracy in localizing an additional source was near chance.},

With regard to horizontal plane, sound localization became easier with head-rotation than head-still condition. All subjects turned their heads toward the presented sounds, yet they did not necessarily turn their heads to face the sound. The amount of head rotation was small for WN compared to that for LPN and HPN. Sound localization also became easier with head-rotation than head-still condition for the median plane.

Even more, since spherical arrays have been applied in several sound field analysis and synthesis tasks recently. However, sampling the sphere is not as easy, and hardly ever as simple and efficient, as equi-spaced sampling the circle. In fact, there are only a few equi-spaced sampling layouts, which have narrow limitations in terms of Fourier (spherical harmonics) analysis. As sampling causes aliasing in the Fourier domain, and most applications in acoustics are based on this domain, it has to be payed considerable attention. This paper discusses the properties of several sampling strategies on the sphere found in literature. Essentially, the impact of aliasing on incident and radiating field representations, as well as practical issues (numerical conditioning, sampling efficiency) are briefly discussed.},

Calculations of ITD values are obtained either from measured time domain Head-Related Impulse Responses (HRIRs) or from their frequency transform Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs). Numerous methods exist in current literature, based on a variety of definitions and assumptions of the nature of the ITD as an acoustic cue. This work presents a thorough comparative study of the degree of variability between some of the most common methods for calculating the ITD from measured data. Thirty-two different calculations or variations are compared for positions on the horizontal plane for the HRTF measured on both a KEMAR mannequin and a rigid sphere. Specifically, the spatial variations of the methods are investigated. Included is a discussion of the primary potential causes of these differences, such as the existence of multiple peaks in the HRIR of the contra-lateral ear for azimuths near the inter-aural axis due to multipath propagation and head/pinnae shadowing.},

abstract = {The Resource Description Framework (RDF) format is being used by a large number of scientific applications to store and disseminate their datasets. The provenance information, describing the source or lineage of the datasets, is playing an increasingly significant role in ensuring data quality, computing trust value of the datasets, and ranking query results. Current provenance tracking approaches using the RDF reification vocabulary suffer from a number of known issues, including lack of formal semantics, use of blank nodes, and application-dependent interpretation of reified RDF triples. In this paper, we introduce a new approach called Provenance Context Entity (PaCE) that uses the notion of provenance context to create provenance-aware RDF triples. We also define the formal semantics of PaCE through a simple extension of the existing RDF(S) semantics that ensures compatibility of PaCE with existing Semantic Web tools and implementations. We have implemented the PaCE approach in the Biomedical Knowledge Repository (BKR) project at the US National Library of Medicine. The evaluations demonstrate a minimum of 49{\%} reduction in total number of provenance-specific RDF triples generated using the PaCE approach as compared to RDF reification. In addition, performance for complex queries improves by three orders of magnitude and remains comparable to the RDF reification approach for simpler provenance queries.},

This paper compares the ITD predictions of the spherical and ellipsoidal head models with offset ears to the measured ITD of thirty seven subjects. The model parameters are first individually optimized and then regression analysis is conducted to predict these parameters from anthropometric measurements. Lower global errors are obtained when the interaural axis is no longer constrained to intersect the center of the sphere or ellipsoid. The global error metrics of both models are very similar but differ in their spatial distributions.},

The Bayes factor has a natural and straightforward interpretation, is based on reasonable assumptions, and has better properties than other methods of inference that have been advocated in the psychological literature. To facilitate use of the Bayes factor, we provide an easy-to-use, Web-based program that performs the necessary calculations.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Acoustical Society of America. Individual binaural room impulse responses (BRIRs) were recorded at a distance of 1.5 m for azimuth angles of 0° and 50° in a reverberant room. Spectral details were reduced in either the direct or the reverberant part of the BRIRs by averaging the magnitude responses with band-pass filters. For various filter bandwidths, the modified BRIRs were convolved with broadband noise and listeners judged the perceived position of the noise when virtualized over headphones. Only reductions in spectral details of the direct part obtained with filter bandwidths broader than one equivalent rectangular bandwidth affected externalization. Reductions in spectral details of the reverberant part had only little influence on externalization. In both conditions, externalization was not as pronounced at 0° as at 50°. To characterize the auditory processes that may be involved in the perception of externalization, a quantitative model is proposed. The model includes an echo-suppression mechanism, a filterbank describing the frequency selectivity in the cochlea and a binaural stage that measures the deviations of the interaural level differences between the considered input and the unmodified input. These deviations, integrated across frequency, are then mapped to a value that corresponds to the perceived externalization.},

abstract = {Spherical microphone arrays have been recently studied for sound analysis and sound recordings, which have the advantage of spherical symmetry facilitating three-dimensional analysis. This paper complements the recent microphone array design studies by presenting a theoretical analysis of plane-wave decomposition given the sound pressure on a sphere. The analysis uses the spherical Fourier transform and the spherical convolution, where it is shown that the amplitudes of the incident plane waves can be calculated as a spherical convolution between the pressure on the sphere and another function which depends on frequency and the sphere radius. The spatial resolution of plane-wave decomposition given limited bandwidth in the spherical Fourier domain is formulated, and ways to improve the computation efficiency of plane-wave decomposition are introduced. The paper concludes with a simulation example of plane-wave decomposition.},

@article{Masiero2014,
abstract = {Dynamic crosstalk cancellation (CTC) systems commonly find use in immersive virtual reality (VR) applications. Such dynamic setups require extremely high filter update rates, so filter calculation is usually performed in the frequency-domain for higher efficiency. This paper proposes a general framework for the calculation of dynamic CTC filters to be used in immersive VR applications. Within this framework, we introduce a causality constraint to the frequency-domain calculation to avoid undesirable wrap-around effects and echo artifacts. Furthermore, when regularization is applied to the CTC filter calculation, in order to limit the output levels at the loudspeakers, noncausal artifacts appear at the CTC filters and the resulting ear signals. We propose a global minimum-phase regularization to convert these anti-causal ringing artifacts into causal artifacts. Finally, an aspect that is especially critical for dynamic CTC systems is the filter switch between active loudspeakers distributed in a surround audio-visual display system with 360 of freedom of operator orientation. Within this framework we apply a weighted filter calculation to control the filter switch, which allows the loudspeakers' contribution to be windowed in space, resulting in a smooth filter transition.},

abstract = {Parametric spatial audio rendering promises fast and perceptually convincing audio cues that remain playback-system agnostic and enable aesthetic modifications of the acoustic experience within games and virtual reality. We propose a parametric encoder for spatial room impulse responses that is tested with nine simulated rooms spanning a large range of sizes and reverberation times. A key component of the pipeline is a perceptually inspired model for determining a minimal set of salient early reflections to reduce computational complexity. The results of a listening study with 27 subjects suggest that rendering six early reflections is indiscernible from a fully-rendered reference for the tested speech content and frequency-independent room simulations based on the image source method. However, the proposed model requires further improvements with respect to detecting and selecting the most-salient early reflections.},

Efficient strategies are discussed, whereby directional panning and mixing are accomplished in an intermediate multichannel format, while the binaural synthesis filters are direction-independent and can be applied after mixing (post-filtering) or off-line on the source signals (pre-filtering). A "binaural B format" is proposed and its application to mixing, recording and reproduction over headphones or two or more loudspeakers are reviewed.},

	doi = {10.1109/PROC.1979.11233},
	abstract = {Engineers in the power industry, face the problem that, while stability is increasingly a limiting factor in secure system operation, the simulation of system dynamic response is grossly overburdening on present-day digital computing resources. Each individual response case involves the step-by-step numerical solution in the time domain of perhaps thousands of nonlinear differential-algebraic equations, at a cost of up to several thousand dollars. A high premium is thus to be placed on the use of the most efficient and reliable modern calculation techniques. This paper is a critical tutorial-review of the calculation methods used routinely or investigated for use by the industry. It concentrates on solution concepts and computational techniques rather than on the analysis of the numerical methods. Details of system modeling are only emphasized when they affect the choice of solution method. The paper concludes with a view of the state of the art and a prediction of future directions of development.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.01103},
	abstract = {The dynamics of power grids are governed by a large number of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs). To safely operate the system, operators need to check that the states described by this set of ODEs stay within prescribed limits after various faults. Limited by the size and stiffness of the ODEs, current numerical integration techniques are often too slow to be useful in real-time or large-scale resource allocation problems. In addition, detailed system parameters are often not exactly known. Machine learning approaches have been proposed to reduce the computational efforts, but existing methods generally suffer from overfitting and failures to predict unstable behaviors. This paper proposes a novel framework for power system dynamic predictions by learning in the frequency domain. The intuition is that although the system behavior is complex in the time domain, there are relatively few dominate modes in the frequency domain. Therefore, we learn to predict by constructing neural networks with Fourier transform and filtering layers. System topology and fault information are encoded by taking a multi-dimensional Fourier transform, allowing us to leverage the fact that the trajectories are sparse both in time and spatial (across different buses) frequencies. We show that the proposed approach does not need detailed system parameters, speeds up prediction computations by orders of magnitude and is highly accurate for different fault types.},

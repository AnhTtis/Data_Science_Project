    "abstract": "We consider a Reissner-Nordström black hole formed by the collapse of a charged null shell. The renormalised expectation values of the energy momentum tensor operator for a massless scalar field propagating in the 2D section of this spacetime are given. We then analyse the across the horizon correlations of the related energy density operator for free falling observers to reveal the correlations between the Hawking particles and their interior partners.",

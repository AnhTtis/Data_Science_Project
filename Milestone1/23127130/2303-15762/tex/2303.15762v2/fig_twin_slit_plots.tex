    \caption{
        % \textbf{Double-slit diffraction plots.}
        Plots of light intensity as a function of $x$ (position on screen) of the experiment in \cref{fig_twin_slit}.
        In red we plot the exact Rayleigh-Sommerfeld (RS) diffraction, i.e. the \emph{unobservable} interference that arises in singular points.
        The spatial extent of a detector on the screen (a pixel in each pattern in \cref{fig_twin_slit_b}) is illustrated as a cyan bar.
        Integrating the RS diffraction over that spatial extent of a pixel computes the numeric ground truth, plotted in dashed green.
        Results obtained with generalized rays are plotted in blue.

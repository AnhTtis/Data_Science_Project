        \textbf{Diffractive materials under different illumination conditions.}
        The appearance of diffractive materials depends on light's spectral, polarimetric and coherence properties.
        (a) During daytime, the illumination reaching the snake is dominated by indirect sunlight.
        At some angles, where incident light has a narrower angular spread (and thus is more coherent), the diffractive scales show clear interference patterns.
        (b) At night, direct light from the fluorescent lamps is the primary source of illumination, however that light is too incoherent to produce visible diffraction patterns.

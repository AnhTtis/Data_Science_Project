        \textbf{Bike scene.}
        The bike scene from \citet{Steinberg_practical_plt_2022} rendered using sample-solve.
        The scene contains a few materials with visible wave-interference effects, most notably the birefringent dielectrics, (a) like the plastic wheel spoke guard, (b-c) as well as the diffraction grated wheel brake surface.
        (b) when illuminated by direct sunlight, this grating disperses light into visible diffraction lobes; however, (c) when sunlight passes through a diffuser (like clouds), only the direct lobe is visible.
        (bottom) Low spp renderings, with (left side) and without (right side) a denoiser, showcasing the interactive rendering performance of our wave-optical renderer.

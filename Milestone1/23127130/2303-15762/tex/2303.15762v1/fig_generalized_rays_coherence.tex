        \textbf{Relation to optical coherence.}
        A \emph{ray bundle} is a collection of generalized rays.
        The optical coherence of that bundle is inversely proportional to the angular spread of generalized rays in the bundle.
        That is, (a) collimated light, where the rays propagated roughly in the same direction, is highly coherent; on the other hand, (b) a ray bundle, in which the rays have a large spread of propagation direction, is weakly coherent.
        The mean direction of propagation $\va{z}$ of the bundle, as well as its \emph{diffusivity}---variance of angular spread of generalized rays---are illustrated.

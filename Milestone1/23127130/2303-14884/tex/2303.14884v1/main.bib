abstract="Information Extraction (IE) from the tables present in scientific articles is challenging due to complicated tabular representations and complex embedded text. This paper presents TabLeX, a large-scale benchmark dataset comprising table images generated from scientific articles. TabLeX consists of two subsets, one for table structure extraction and the other for table content extraction. Each table image is accompanied by its corresponding LaTeX source code. To facilitate the development of robust table IE tools, TabLeX contains images in different aspect ratios and in a variety of fonts. Our analysis sheds light on the shortcomings of current state-of-the-art table extraction models and shows that they fail on even simple table images. Towards the end, we experiment with a transformer-based existing baseline to report performance scores. In contrast to the static benchmarks, we plan to augment this dataset with more complex and diverse tables at regular intervals.",

abstract = {Machine learning is being deployed in a growing number of applications which demand real-time, accurate, and robust predictions under heavy query load. However, most machine learning frameworks and systems only address model training and not deployment. In this paper, we introduce Clipper, a general-purpose low-latency prediction serving system. Interposing between end-user applications and a wide range of machine learning frameworks, Clipper introduces a modular architecture to simplify model deployment across frameworks and applications. Furthermore, by introducing caching, batching, and adaptive model selection techniques, Clipper reduces prediction latency and improves prediction throughput, accuracy, and robustness without modifying the underlying machine learning frameworks. We evaluate Clipper on four common machine learning benchmark datasets and demonstrate its ability to meet the latency, accuracy, and throughput demands of online serving applications. Finally, we compare Clipper to the Tensor-flow Serving system and demonstrate that we are able to achieve comparable throughput and latency while enabling model composition and online learning to improve accuracy and render more robust predictions.},

abstract = {To support complex data-intensive applications such as personalized recommendations, targeted advertising, and intelligent services, the data management community has focused heavily on the design of systems to support training complex models on large datasets. Unfortunately, the design of these systems largely ignores a critical component of the overall analytics process: the deployment and serving of models at scale. In this work, we present Velox, a new component of the Berkeley Data Analytics Stack. Velox is a data management system for facilitating the next steps in real-world, large-scale analytics pipelines: online model management, maintenance, and serving. Velox provides end-user applications and services with a low-latency, intuitive interface to models, transforming the raw statistical models currently trained using existing offline large-scale compute frameworks into full-blown, end-to-end data products capable of recommending products, targeting advertisements, and personalizing web content. To provide up-to-date results for these complex models, Velox also facilitates lightweight online model maintenance and selection (i.e., dynamic weighting). In this paper, we describe the challenges and architectural considerations required to achieve this functionality, including the abilities to span online and offline systems, to adaptively adjust model materialization strategies, and to exploit inherent statistical properties such as model error tolerance, all while operating at "Big Data" scale.},

abstract = {Spatio-temporal detection of actions and events in video is a challenging problem. Besides the difficulties related to recognition, a major challenge for detection in video is the size of the search space defined by spatio-temporal tubes formed by sequences of bounding boxes along the frames. Recently methods that generate unsupervised detection proposals have proven to be very effective for object detection in still images. These methods open the possibility to use strong but computationally expensive features since only a relatively small number of detection hypotheses need to be assessed. In this paper we make two contributions towards exploiting detection proposals for spatio-temporal detection problems. First, we extend a recent 2D object proposal method, to produce spatio-temporal proposals by a randomized supervoxel merging process. We introduce spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal pairwise supervoxel features that are used to guide the merging process. Second, we propose a new efficient supervoxel method. We experimentally evaluate our detection proposals, in combination with our new supervoxel method as well as existing ones. This evaluation shows that our supervoxels lead to more accurate proposals when compared to using existing state-of-the-art supervoxel methods.},

Among these shape methods, Fourier descriptor (FD) is one of the most widely used shape descriptors due to its simple computation, clarity and coarse to fine description capability. FD has been applied to a variety of applications, including image retrieval application. Generally, FD can be acquired in a number of ways, however, FD acquired from different ways can have different retrieval performance. In this paper, we study shape retrieval using FD. Specifically, we study different ways of acquiring FD, the number of FD features needed for general shape description and the retrieval performance of different FD. A Java client-server retrieval framework has been developed to facilitate the study. The retrieval performance of the different FD is tested using a standard shape database and a commonly used performance measurement. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Because a human face contour includes very important facial features to identifying or verifying a person, the accuracy of face contour extraction influences performance of face recognition. The automatic extraction human face contour algorithm includes a novel flowchart for improving accuracy of face contours extraction. To obtain the edge map of a face contour, the divided-and-conquer technique and Canny edge detector were used to avoid the features in the central part of face. The genetic algorithm is implemented to automatically find the parameters of Canny edge detector. Finally, the Poisson gradient vector flow (PGVF) active contour model used the edge map to extract face contours. Three datasets with temporal sequence images were tested for evaluation of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results demonstrated that the algorithm obtained accurate face contours. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Based on the eye and mouth positions, which can be detected by the algorithms proposed in Ref. 1 [G. Chow and X. Li, Pattern Recognition 26, 1739-1755 (1993)], a simplified adaptive Hough transform (AHT) technique is used to identify straight cheek lines which are approximately vertical from the edge image. Independently, parabolas forming the chin are detected by another AHT procedure. The location and curvature of the chin line, together with the cheek lines, characterize the shape of the face. This method was tested on over 70 different face images and is shown to produce results with a high degree of accuracy. We discuss in detail the specific issues involved in the detections, such as the definition of relevant subimage, parameter ranges, resolution of the accumulator array, peak cells, and end point determination. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

They consist of a PCA model of face shape and colour information and allow to reconstruct a 3D face from a single 2D image. 3D Morphable Face Models are used for 3D head pose estimation, face analysis, face recognition, and, more recently, facial landmark detection and tracking. However, they are not as widely used as 2D methods -the process of building and using a 3D model is much more involved. In this paper, we present the Surrey Face Model, a multi-resolution 3D Morphable Model that we make available to the public for non-commercial purposes. The model contains different mesh resolution levels and landmark point annotations as well as metadata for texture remapping. Accompanying the model is a lightweight open-source C++ library designed with simplicity and ease of integration as its foremost goals. In addition to basic functionality, it contains pose estimation and face frontalisation algorithms. With the tools presented in this paper, we aim to close two gaps. First, by offering different model resolution levels and fast fitting functionality, we enable the use of a 3D Morphable Model in time-critical applications like tracking. Second, the software library makes it easy for the community to adopt the 3D Morphable Face Model in their research, and it offers a public place for collaboration.},

Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) have been successfully utilized in facial landmark localization for two-fold advantages: 1) geometric constraints among facial points are implicitly utilized, 2) huge amount of training data can be leveraged. However, in the task of extensive facial landmark localization, a large number of facial landmarks (more than 50 points) are required to be located in a unified system, which poses great difficulty in the structure design and training process of traditional convolutional networks. In this paper, we design a four-level convolutional network cascade, which tackles the problem in a coarse-to-fine manner. In our system, each network level is trained to locally refine a subset of facial landmarks generated by previous network levels. In addition, each level predicts explicit geometric constraints (the position and rotation angles of a specific facial component) to rectify the inputs of the current network level. The combination of coarse-to-fine cascade and geometric refinement enables our system to locate extensive facial landmarks (68 points) accurately in the 300-W facial landmark localization challenge.},

Our method uses entire face images at all stages, contrary to the recently proposed face alignment methods that rely on local patches. This is possible thanks to the use of landmark heatmaps which provide visual information about landmark locations estimated at the previous stages of the algorithm. The use of entire face images rather than patches allows DAN to handle face images with large variation in head pose and difficult initializations. An extensive evaluation on two publicly available datasets shows that DAN reduces the state-of-the-art failure rate by up to 70{\%}. Our method has also been submitted for evaluation as part of the Menpo challenge.},

abstract = {We propose a new approach for estimation of the positions of facial key points with three-level carefully designed convolutional networks. At each level, the outputs of multiple networks are fused for robust and accurate estimation. Thanks to the deep structures of convolutional networks, global high-level features are extracted over the whole face region at the initialization stage, which help to locate high accuracy key points. There are two folds of advantage for this. First, the texture context information over the entire face is utilized to locate each key point. Second, since the networks are trained to predict all the key points simultaneously, the geometric constraints among key points are implicitly encoded. The method therefore can avoid local minimum caused by ambiguity and data corruption in difficult image samples due to occlusions, large pose variations, and extreme lightings. The networks at the following two levels are trained to locally refine initial predictions and their inputs are limited to small regions around the initial predictions. Several network structures critical for accurate and robust facial point detection are investigated. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both detection accuracy and reliability.},

publisher = {Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc.},
address = {San Francisco, CA, USA},
abstract = {This book is the first comprehensive presentation of the principles and tools available for programming multiprocessor machines. It is of immediate use to programmers working with the new architectures. For example, the next generation of computer game consoles will all be multiprocessor-based, and the game industry is currently struggling to understand how to address the programming challenges presented by these machines.This change in the industry is so fundamental that it is certain to require a significant response by universities, and courses on multicore programming will become a staple of computer science curriculums.The authors are well known and respected in this community and both teach and conduct research in this area. Prof. Maurice Herlihy is on the faculty of Brown University. He is the recipient of the 2003 Dijkstra Prize in distributed computing. Prof. Nir Shavit is on the faculty of Tel-Aviv University and a member of the technical staff at Sun Microsystems Laboratories. In 2004 they shared the Gdel Prize, the highest award in theoretical computer science. * THE book on multicore programming, the new paradigm of computer science* Written by the world's most revered experts in multiprocessor programming and performance* Includes examples, models, exercises, PowerPoint slides, and sample Java programs}

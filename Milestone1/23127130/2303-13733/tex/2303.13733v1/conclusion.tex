\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}
Smart contracts fundamentally have different characteristics from conventional programs. The difference induces several restrictions on adopting existing software watermark techniques to smart contracts. 
In this work, we present \sys, a novel watermarking scheme on smart contracts.
Our empirical evaluation shows the practicality and effectiveness 
of \sys from both security and economic perspectives,
which is resistant to various attacks against a watermark at acceptable cost.

\section{Data and Source Code Availability} 
\label{availability}
To foster further watermarking research for smart contracts, we disclose all of our evaluation dataset to the public. 
We have opened the datasets on a preserved digital repository\footnote{https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21966875.v1} and source code\footnote{https://github.com/SKKU-SecLab/SmartMark.git}, so that anyone can reproduce our work.

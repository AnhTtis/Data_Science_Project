    "abstract": "Laves phases often form as secondary phases in metallic alloys and have a significant effect on their structural properties. Thus, phase stability studies for these chemically and structurally complex phases in addition to mechanical behavior studies are of great interest. In this work, we use the concept of metastable bulk phase and defect phase diagrams to augment the understanding of the bulk phase and defect phase stability in Laves phases in Mg-based alloys. In this way, we resolve the discrepancy between bulk phase diagrams and experimental observations regarding the formation of Mg-rich C14 and Al-rich C15 Laves phases in MgAlCa alloys at moderate temperatures. Moreover, the effect of the thermodynamic state of alloys on the competition between solute-rich hcp-like planar defects and stoichiometric basal stacking faults is clarified, which determines the brittleness of these alloys. \\end{abstract}",

    "abstract": "A concern among content moderation researchers is that hard moderation\nmeasures, such as banning content producers, will push users to more extreme\ninformation environments. Research in this area is still new, but predominately\nfocuses on one-way migration (from mainstream to alt-tech) due to this concern.\nHowever, content producers on alt-tech social media platforms are not always\nbanned users from mainstream platforms, instead they may be co-active across\nplatforms. We explore co-activity on two such platforms: YouTube and BitChute.\nSpecifically, we describe differences in video production across 27 co-active\nchannels. We find that the majority of channels use significantly more moral\nand political words in their video titles on BitChute than in their video\ntitles on YouTube. However, the reasoning for this shift seems to be different\nacross channels. In some cases, we find that channels produce videos on\ndifferent sets of topics across the platforms, often producing content on\nBitChute that would likely be moderated on YouTube. In rare cases, we find\nvideo titles of the same video change across the platforms. Overall, there is\nnot a consistent trend across co-active channels in our sample, suggesting that\nthe production on alt-tech social media platforms does not fit a single\nnarrative.",

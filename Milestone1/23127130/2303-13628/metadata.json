    "abstract": "We study the low temperature properties of the two-dimensional weakly interacting Hubbard model on $\\ZZZ^2$ with renormalized chemical potential $μ=2-μ_0$, $μ_0=10^{-10}$ fixed, in which case the Fermi surface is close to a perfect square. Using fermionic functional integrals, cluster expansions and rigorous renormalization group analysis, we prove that the perturbation series for the two-point Schwinger function is analytic in the coupling constant $ł$ in the domain $ł\\in\\RR_T=\\{ł\\in\\RRR,\\vertλ\\log^2(μ_0^3T/C_1)|\\le C_2\\}$ for any fixed temperature $T>0$, suggesting that there is a phase transition with critical temperature $T_c= \\frac{C_1}{\\m_0^3}\\exp{(-C^{1/2}_2|λ|^{-1/2})}$. Here $C_1, C_2$ are positive constants independent of $T$ and $ł$. We also prove that the second derivative of the momentum space self-energy function w.r.t. the external momentum is not uniformly bounded, suggesting that this model is {\\it not} a Fermi liquid in the mathematically precise sense of Salmhofer. This result can be viewed as a first step towards rigorous study of the Fermi liquid-non Fermi liquid crossover phenomenon.",

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
Physics-guided neural networks are used to learn and subsequently compensate hard-to-model dynamics such as cable forces and configuration-dependent friction characteristics in an interventional X-ray setup. In this PGNN, the nonlinear equation of motion of one of the X-ray's axis is complemented by a feedforward neural network. The orthogonal projection-based regularizer for this physical model is derived and used during simultaneous optimization to successfully ensure complementarity of the two components. Application of the PGNN results in a factor 5 improved tracking error while maintaining an interpretable physical model that can be used as a baseline. 
%Future work consists of compensating the stick-slip effects after stationary periods to even further improve performance.

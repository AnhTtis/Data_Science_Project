Since quantum systems produce counter-intuitive patterns believed not to be efficiently produced by classical systems, it is reasonable to postulate that quantum computers may outperform classical computers on machine learning tasks. The field of quantum machine learning explores how to devise and implement concrete quantum software that offers such advantages. Recent work has made clear that the hardware and software challenges are still considerable but has also opened paths towards solutions.},

  abstract = {Here we will give a perspective on new possible interplays between machine learning and quantum physics, including also practical cases and applications. We will explore the ways in which machine learning could benefit from new quantum technologies and algorithms to find new ways to speed up their computations by breakthroughs in physical hardware, as well as to improve existing models or devise new learning schemes in the quantum domain. Moreover, there are lots of experiments in quantum physics that do generate incredible amounts of data and machine learning would be a great tool to analyze those and make predictions, or even control the experiment itself. On top of that, data visualization techniques and other schemes borrowed from machine learning can be of great use to theoreticians to have better intuition on the structure of complex manifolds or to make predictions on theoretical models. This new research field, named as quantum machine learning, is very rapidly growing since it is expected to provide huge advantages over its classical counterpart and deeper investigations are timely needed since they can be already tested on the already commercially available quantum machines.},

It is based on the deep Boltzmann machine architecture, in which two layers of hidden neurons mediate quantum correlations among physical degrees of freedom in the visible layer. The approach reproduces the exact imaginary-time Hamiltonian evolution, and is completely deterministic. In turn, compact and exact network representations for the ground states are obtained without stochastic optimization of the network parameters. The number of neurons grows linearly with the system size and total imaginary time, respectively. Physical quantities can be measured by sampling configurations of both physical and neuron degrees of freedom. We provide specific examples for the transverse-field Ising and Heisenberg models by implementing efficient sampling. As a compact, classical representation for many-body quantum systems, our approach is an alternative to the standard path integral, and it is potentially useful also to systematically improve on numerical approaches based on the restricted Boltzmann machine architecture.},

  abstract = {Machine learning, one of today's most rapidly growing interdisciplinary fields, promises an unprecedented perspective for solving intricate quantum many-body problems. Understanding the physical aspects of the representative artificial neural-network states is recently becoming highly desirable in the applications of machine learning techniques to quantum many-body physics. Here, we study the quantum entanglement properties of neural-network states, with a focus on the restricted-Boltzmann-machine (RBM) architecture. We prove that the entanglement of all short-range RBM states satisfies an area law for arbitrary dimensions and bipartition geometry. For long-range RBM states we show by using an exact construction that such states could exhibit volume-law entanglement, implying a notable capability of RBM in representing efficiently quantum states with massive entanglement. We further examine generic RBM states with random weight parameters. We find that their averaged entanglement entropy obeys volume-law scaling and meantime strongly deviates from the Page-entropy of the completely random pure states. We show that their entanglement spectrum has no universal part associated with random matrix theory and bears a Poisson-type level statistics. Using reinforcement learning, we demonstrate that RBM is capable of finding the ground state (with power-law entanglement) of a model Hamiltonian with long-range interaction. In addition, we show, through a concrete example of the one-dimensional symmetry-protected topological cluster states, that the RBM representation may also be used as a tool to analytically compute the entanglement spectrum. Our results uncover the unparalleled power of artificial neural networks in representing quantum many-body states, which paves a novel way to bridge computer science based machine learning techniques to outstanding quantum condensed matter physics problems.},

For dynamics and small systems, we find excellent agreement with exact diagonalization, while for systems up to N=256 spins close consistency with interacting spin-wave theory is obtained.

All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future. We first observe the influence of the non-linear activations functions. We find that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we find that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We find that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneficial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difficult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1. Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence.},

  abstract = {Modern deep learning has enabled unprecedented achievements in various domains. Nonetheless, employment of machine learning for wave function representations is focused on more traditional architectures such as restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) and fully-connected neural networks. In this letter, we establish that contemporary deep learning architectures, in the form of deep convolutional and recurrent networks, can efficiently represent highly entangled quantum systems. By constructing Tensor Network equivalents of these architectures, we identify an inherent reuse of information in the network operation as a key trait which distinguishes them from standard Tensor Network based representations, and which enhances their entanglement capacity. Our results show that such architectures can support volume-law entanglement scaling, polynomially more efficiently than presently employed RBMs. Thus, beyond a quantification of the entanglement capacity of leading deep learning architectures, our analysis formally motivates a shift of trending neural-network based wave function representations closer to the state-of-the-art in machine learning.},

The calculation involves a statistical problem which is shown to be exactly equivalent to the Ising ferromagnetic problem. This cannot be solved exactly, except in the one-dimensional case, and so the Bethe\textendash Peierls method is used to solve it approximately. In complete contradiction to the Kubo (1953) variational calculation it is concluded that all lattices have disordered ground states. The energy differences between ordered and disordered states are small and so the nature of the ground state is likely to be sensitive to small additional ordering forces.},

Moreover, we show that double descent occurs not just as a function of model size, but also as a function of the number of training epochs. We unify the above phenomena by defining a new complexity measure we call the effective model complexity and conjecture a generalized double descent with respect to this measure. Furthermore, our notion of model complexity allows us to identify certain regimes where increasing (even quadrupling) the number of train samples actually hurts test performance.},

In order to show the usefulness of the method among all available numerical methods, it is imperative to investigate the performance in challenging many-body problems for which the exact solutions are not available. Here, we construct a variational wave function with one of the simplest neural networks, the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), and apply it to a fundamental but unsolved quantum spin Hamiltonian, the two-dimensional J1 \textendash J2 Heisenberg model on the square lattice. We supplement the RBM wave function with quantum-number projections, which restores the symmetry of the wave function and makes it possible to calculate excited states. Then, we perform a systematic investigation of the performance of the RBM. We show that, with the help of the symmetry, the RBM wave function achieves state-of-the-art accuracy both in ground-state and excited-state calculations. The study shows a practical guideline on how we achieve accuracy in a controlled manner.},

Recently a greedy layerwise procedure was proposed to initialize weights of deep belief networks, by viewing each layer as a separate Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). We develop the Convolutional RBM (C-RBM), a variant of the RBM model in which weights are shared to respect the spatial structure of images. This framework learns a set of features that can generate the images of a specific object class. Our feature extraction model is a four layer hierarchy of alternating filtering and maximum subsampling. We learn feature parameters of the first and third layers viewing them as separate C-RBMs. The outputs of our feature extraction hierarchy are then fed as input to a discriminative classifier. It is experimentally demonstrated that the extracted features are effective for object detection, using them to obtain performance comparable to the state-of-the-art on handwritten digit recognition and pedestrian detection.},

Our conclusions are based on finite-size scaling of excited level crossings and order parameters. Together with previous results on candidate models for deconfined quantum criticality and spin liquid phases, our results point to a unified quantum phase diagram where the deconfined quantum-critical point separates a line of first-order transitions and a gapless spin liquid phase. The frustrated Shastry-Sutherland model is close to the critical point but slightly inside the spin liquid phase, while previously studied unfrustrated models cross the first-order line. We also argue that recent heat capacity measurements in SrCu2(BO3)2 show evidence of the proposed spin liquid at pressures between 2.6 and 3 GPa.},

In this paper, we present a novel framework of transformationinvariant feature learning by incorporating linear transformations into the feature learning algorithms. For example, we present the transformation-invariant restricted Boltzmann machine that compactly represents data by its weights and their transformations, which achieves invariance of the feature representation via probabilistic max pooling. In addition, we show that our transformation-invariant feature learning framework can also be extended to other unsupervised learning methods, such as autoencoders or sparse coding. We evaluate our method on several image classification benchmark datasets, such as MNIST variations, CIFAR-10, and STL-10, and show competitive or superior classification performance when compared to the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our method achieves state-of-theart performance on phone classification tasks with the TIMIT dataset, which demonstrates wide applicability of our proposed algorithms to other domains.},

  abstract = {Combining insights from machine learning and quantum Monte Carlo, the stochastic reconfiguration method with neural network Ansatz states is a promising new direction for high-precision ground state estimation of quantum many-body problems. Even though this method works well in practice, little is known about the learning dynamics. In this paper, we bring to light several hidden details of the algorithm by analyzing the learning landscape. In particular, the spectrum of the quantum Fisher matrix of complex restricted Boltzmann machine states exhibits a universal initial dynamics, but the converged spectrum can dramatically change across a phase transition. In contrast to the spectral properties of the quantum Fisher matrix, the actual weights of the network at convergence do not reveal much information about the system or the dynamics. Furthermore, we identify a new measure of correlation in the state by analyzing entanglement in eigenvectors. We show that, generically, the learning landscape modes with least entanglement have largest eigenvalue, suggesting that correlations are encoded in large flat valleys of the learning landscape, favoring stable representations of the ground state.},

We demonstrate that this problem can be overcome by sampling in the basis of irreducible representations instead of spins, for which the corresponding ansatz respects the nonabelian symmetries of the system. We apply our methodology to find the ground states of the one-dimensional antiferromagnetic Heisenberg (AFH) model with spin-half and spin-1 degrees of freedom, and obtain a substantially higher accuracy than when using the \$s\_z\$-basis as input to the neural network. The proposed ansatz can target excited states, which is illustrated by calculating the energy gap of the AFH model. We also generalize the framework to the case of anyonic spin chains.},

Here we study the main factors governing the applicability of NQS to frustrated magnets by training neural networks to approximate ground states of several moderately-sized Hamiltonians using the corresponding wave function structure on a small subset of the Hilbert space basis as training dataset. We notice that generalization quality, i.e. the ability to learn from a limited number of samples and correctly approximate the target state on the rest of the space, drops abruptly when frustration is increased. We also show that learning the sign structure is considerably more difficult than learning amplitudes. Finally, we conclude that the main issue to be addressed at this stage, in order to use the method of NQS for simulating realistic models, is that of generalization rather than expressibility.},

We devise and present physics-inspired transfer learning protocols, reusing the features of neural-network quantum states learned for the computation of the ground state of a small system for systems of larger sizes. We implement different protocols for restricted Boltzmann machines on general-purpose graphics processing units. This implementation alone yields a speedup over existing implementations on multi-core and distributed central processing units in comparable settings. We empirically and comparatively evaluate the efficiency (time) and effectiveness (accuracy) of different transfer learning protocols as we scale the system size in different models and different quantum phases. Namely, we consider both the transverse field Ising and Heisenberg XXZ models in one dimension, and also in two dimensions for the latter, with system sizes up to 128 and 8 x 8 spins. We empirically demonstrate that some of the transfer learning protocols that we have devised can be far more effective and efficient than starting from neural-network quantum states with randomly initialized parameters.},

	journal = {Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter},
	abstract = {The magnetic properties of SrCu2 (BO3)2 are reviewed from a theoretical point of view. SrCu2 (BO3)2 is a new two-dimensional spin gap system and its magnetic properties are well described by a spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model of the orthogonal dimer lattice. The model has a dimer singlet ground state whose exactness was proven by Shastry and Sutherland for a topologically equivalent model more than 20 years ago. The exactness of the ground state is maintained even if interlayer couplings are introduced for SrCu2 (BO3)2. In the two-dimensional model, quantum phase transitions take place between different ground states for which three phases are expected: a gapped dimer singlet state, a plaquette resonating valence bond state and a gapless magnetic ordered state. Analysis of the experimental data shows that the dimer singlet ground state is realized in SrCu2 (BO3)2. The orthogonality of the dimer bonds, which is the underlying symmetry of the exactness of the ground state, also leads to an unusual property of elementary excitations, namely the almost localized nature of the triplet excitations. Application of an external magnetic field changes the density of the triplet excitations. In general, there is competition between kinetic energies and interaction energies between triplets. The almost localized nature of the triplets makes it easy to form regular lattices. In fact, at certain densities, where the commensurability energy is significant, the triplet excitations form superstructures and plateaux appear at 1/2, 1/3, 1/4 and 1/8 in the magnetization curve. In high-magnetic-field experiments, magnetic plateaux at magnetizations of 1/3, 1/4 and 1/8 have been observed. Translational symmetry of the lattice is spontaneously broken at the plateaux, except for the 1/2 plateau. The 1/3 and 1/4 plateaux are expected to have magnetic superstructures of stripe form while the 1/2 plateau has a square unit cell and the 1/8 plateau a rhomboid cell. Especially at the 1/8 plateau, nuclear magnetic resonance experiments indicate the presence of at least 11 distinct Cu sites with different spin polarizations, which is the first evidence of breaking of the translational symmetry at the plateau phase. The spin texture calculated on the basis of a Heisenberg model with adiabatic spin–phonon coupling is consistent with the experimental results.}

	abstract="This chapter is devoted to a review of the phenomenon of magnetization plateaus in frustrated quantum magnets. We explain why frustration can introduce `accidents' in the magnetization process of quantum antiferromagnets, in the form of plateaus occurring at rational values of the magnetization. These are driven by two mechanisms: the stabilization of a commensurate, classical state by quantum fluctuations or the occurrence of a superfluid-insulator transition in effective hard-core-boson models. The first mechanism always leads to a `classical' plateau, i.e. a plateau with a simple classical analog, while the second often drives the system into a `quantum' plateau which has no classical analog. Experimental examples of such plateaus are discussed in detail, with special emphasis on the compound SrCu2(BO3)2, in which a remarkable series of plateaus has been discovered and is currently under intensive investigation. Related topics including magnetization jumps, supersolid phases, and lattice distortions are discussed briefly.",

	abstract={The 2-dimensional layered oxide material SrCu2(BO3)2, long studied as a realization of the Shastry-Sutherland spin topology, exhibits a range of intriguing physics as a function of both hydrostatic pressure and magnetic field, with a still debated intermediate plaquette phase appearing at approximately 20 kbar and a possible deconfined critical point at higher pressure. Here, we employ a tunnel diode oscillator (TDO) technique to probe the behavior in the combined extreme conditions of high pressure, high magnetic field, and low temperature. We reveal an extensive phase space consisting of multiple magnetic analogs of the elusive supersolid phase and a magnetization plateau. In particular, a 10{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}2 supersolid and a 1/5 plateau, identified by infinite Projected Entangled Pair States (iPEPS) calculations, are found to rely on the presence of both magnetic and non-magnetic particles in the sea of dimer singlets. These states are best understood as descendants of the full-plaquette phase, the leading candidate for the intermediate phase of SrCu2(BO3)2.},

	abstract={We present a study of the ground state and stability of the fractional plateau phase (FPP) with M/Msat{\thinspace}={\thinspace}1/8 in the metallic Shastry--Sutherland system TmB4. Magnetization (M) measurements show that the FPP states are thermodynamically stable when the sample is cooled in constant magnetic field from the paramagnetic phase to the ordered one at 2 K. On the other hand, after zero-field cooling and subsequent magnetization these states appear to be of dynamic origin. In this case the FPP states are closely associated with the half plateau phase (HPP, M/Msat{\thinspace}={\thinspace}{\textonehalf}), mediate the HPP to the low-field antiferromagnetic (AF) phase and depend on the thermodynamic history. Thus, in the same place of the phase diagram both, the stable and the metastable (dynamic) fractional plateau (FP) states, can be observed, depending on the way they are reached. In case of metastable FP states thermodynamic paths are identified that lead to very flat fractional plateaus in the FPP. Moreover, with a further decrease of magnetic field also the low-field AF phase becomes influenced and exhibits a plateau of the order of 1/1000 Msat.},

Here, we explore several CaCo2Al8 structure type antiferromagnets and elucidate their strong magnetic frustration-driven ground states occasioned by the arrangements of the magnetic ions on a Shastry-Sutherland lattice and the interplay with quantum fluctuations.}

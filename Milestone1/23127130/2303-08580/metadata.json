    "abstract": "We re-examine the effect of long-range Coulomb interactions on the collective amplitude and phase modes in the incommensurate charge-density wave ground state of quasi-one-dimensional conductors. Using an effective action approach we show that the longitudinal acoustic phonon protects the gapless linear dispersion of the lowest phase mode in the presence of long-range Coulomb interactions. Moreover, in Gaussian approximation amplitude fluctuations are not affected by long-range Coulomb interactions. We also calculate the collective mode dispersions at finite temperatures and compare our results with the measured energies of amplitude and phase modes in K$_{0.3}$MoO$_3$. With the exception of the lowest phase mode, the temperature dependence of the measured mode energies can be quantitatively described within a multi-phonon Fröhlich model neglecting long-range Coulomb interactions.",

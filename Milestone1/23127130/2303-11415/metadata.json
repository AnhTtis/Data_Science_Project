    "abstract": "In moderately-coupled plasma, a significant fraction of the internal energy resides in electric fields. As these plasmas are heated or compressed, the shifting partition of energy between particles and fields leads to surprising effects, particularly when ions and electrons have different temperatures. For a large interspecies mass ratio, temperature differences can persist for long times. Employing a thermodynamic approach, coupled quasi-Equations of State for the electrons and ions are derived and put into a simple form. It can then easily be shown that adiabatic compression can lead to significant separation between electron and ion temperatures at moderate coupling strength. Remarkably, correlation heating can occur, whereby the ion temperature increases following the heating of the electrons, even in the absence of interspecies collisions. This additional channel for ion heating may be relevant to ignition regimes for inertial confinement fusion (ICF).",

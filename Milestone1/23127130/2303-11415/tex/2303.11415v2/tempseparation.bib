The system includes the continuity equations, equations of motion, and the equation of heat transport for electrons and ions. The electron and ion temperatures are considered to be different. The case of arbitrary ratio of the particle collision frequency to the Larmor frequency is considered.

The models are all extensions of the Ornstein–Zernike/hypernetted-chain theory used to good success for equilibrium plasmas. Each theory is evaluated at several coupling strengths, temperature ratios, and mass ratios for a model plasma in which the electrons are positively charged. We show that the model proposed by Seuferling et al. [Phys. Rev. A 40, 323 (1989)] agrees well with molecular dynamics over a wide range of mass and temperature ratios, as well as over a range of coupling strength similar to that of the equilibrium hypernetted-chain (HNC) theory. The SVT model also correctly predicts the strength of interspecies correlations and exhibits physically reasonable long-wavelength limits of the static structure factors. Comparisons of the SVT model with the Yukawa one-component plasma (YOCP) model are used to show that ion-ion pair correlations are well described by the YOCP model up to

To apply this definition in practice requires access to the physical system’s microstates, which may be prohibitively inefficient to sample or difficult to obtain experimentally. It is beneficial, therefore, to relate the entropy to other integrated properties which are accessible out of equilibrium. We focus on the structure factor, which describes the spatial correlations of density fluctuations and can be directly measured by scattering. The information gained by a given structure factor regarding an otherwise unknown system provides an upper bound for the system’s entropy. We find that the maximum-entropy model corresponds to an equilibrium system with an effective pair interaction. Approximate closed-form relations for the effective pair potential and the resulting entropy in terms of the structure factor are obtained. As examples, the relations are used to estimate the entropy of an exactly solvable model and two simulated systems out of equilibrium. The focus is on low-dimensional examples, where our method, as well as a recently proposed compression-based one, can be tested against a rigorous direct-sampling technique. The entropy inferred from the structure factor is found to be consistent with the other methods, superior for larger system sizes, and accurate in identifying global transitions.

Iterative numerical algorithms have been employed to enforce this equilibration and compute the resulting approximate state relations in single-temperature mixtures. In partially ionized gas mixtures, there is both theoretical and empirical evidence that equilibrating the chemical potentials, number densities, or partial pressures of the free electrons is likely to produce more accurate results than equilibrating the total pressures. Moreover, in many situations of practical interest the free electrons and heavy particles have different temperatures. In this paper, we present a generalized algorithm for equilibrating the heavy-particle and electron temperatures and a third user-specified independent thermodynamic variable in a two-temperature plasma mixture. Test calculations based on the equilibration of total pressure vs. electron pressure are presented for three different mixtures.}, number={2}, journal={Physics of Plasmas}, publisher={American Institute of Physics}, author={Ramshaw, John D. and Cook, Andrew W.}, year={2014}, month={Feb}, pages={022706} }



 @article{Bi_Mauro_Christensen-Dalsgaard, title={Coulomb corrections to the equation of state for a weakly-coupled plasma}, abstractNote={Coulomb corrections to the equation of state of degenerate matter are usually described by Debye-Hu¨ckel theory; however, recent studies have considered modiﬁcations of thermodynamic quantities which are caused by the interactions of charged particles beyond the Debye-Hu¨ckel approximation. Based on the weakly-coupled plasma limit, the formulae for the physical properties of non-ideal effects on the equation of state are derived. The treatment of the non-ideal effects due to Coulomb coupling combines the results of quantum-statistic calculations for the electrons, N -body semianalytic theory for ions, and the extended Debye-Hu¨ckel theory with hard-core correction for the electron-ion interaction. The leading Coulomb correction not only can be applied to the weak-coupling region, but also preserves the well-known Debye-Hu¨ckel limit at Γ 1. We examine the Coulomb correction to the thermodynamic quantities of a weakly coupled and fully ionized plasma. The result reveals that the contribution is quite significant, and hence modiﬁes the thermodynamic properties of the plasma substantially.}, author={Bi, S L and Mauro, M P Di and Christensen-Dalsgaard, J}, pages={8},  }

The frequencies depend on solar structure, and on the properties of the plasma in the Sun. Here we consider in particular the dependence on the thermodynamic state. From an analysis of the equations of stellar structure, and the relevant aspects of the properties of the oscillations, we argue that in the convection zone one can isolate information about the equation of state which is relatively unaffected by other uncertainties in the physics of the solar interior. We review the different treatments that have been used to describe the thermodynamics of stellar plasmas. Through application of several of these to the computation of models of the solar envelope we demonstrate that the sensitivity of the observed frequencies is in fact sufficient to distinguish even quite subtle features of the physics of solar matter.

Such pair potentials based on density functional theory are parameter-free and depend directly on the electron temperature and indirectly on the ion temperature, enabling efficient computation of two-temperature properties. Comparison with ab initio simulations and with other average-atom calculations for equilibrium aluminum shows good agreement, justifying a study of quasiequilibrium situations. Analyzing the van Hove function, we find that ion-ion correlations vanish in a time significantly smaller than the electron-ion relaxation time so that dynamical properties have a physical meaning for the quasiequilibrium state. A significant increase in the speed of sound is predicted from the modification of the dispersion relation of the ion acoustic mode as the electron temperature is increased.

In addition to Z-pinches, plasma turbulence can be compressed in a range of natural and laboratory settings, including inertial fusion experiments and astrophysical molecular clouds. The plasma viscosity, when modeled as described by Braginskii, depends strongly on both temperature and ionization state, giving it the possibility to have a large range of behavior. Here, we highlight the importance of viscous variation in these settings, as well as various insights that can be gained by considering this variation. Included are a “sudden viscous dissipation” effect that leads to a new concept for inertial fusion or X-ray bursts and a bound on turbulent energy behavior under compression. This bound, which was previously applied in inviscid molecular cloud turbulence, is here shown in an application to turbulence that transitions from inviscid to viscous regimes.

Based on recent numerical results, we have constructed analytical approximations for the thermodynamic functions of harmonic Coulomb crystals in quantizing magnetic fields. The analytical description ensures a consistent evaluation of all astrophysically important thermodynamic functions based on the first, second, and mixed derivatives of the free energy. Our numerical code for calculation of thermodynamic functions based on these approximations has been made publicly available. Using this code, we calculate and discuss the effects of electron screening and magnetic quantization on the position of the melting point in a range of densities and magnetic fields relevant to white dwarfs and outer envelopes of neutron stars.

It is shown that equilibrium (equation of state) phenomena and non-equilibrium dynamical processes like photoionization are characterized by different values of the IPD. In the former, the ionization potential of an atom embedded in matter is the difference in the free energy of the many-body system between states of thermodynamic equilibrium differing by the ionization state of just one atom. Typically, this energy is less than that required to ionize the same atom in vacuo. Probably, the best known example of this is the IPD given by Stewart and Pyatt (SP). However, it is a common misconception that this formula should apply directly to the energy of a photon causing photoionization, since this is a local adiabatic process that occurs in the absence of a response from the surrounding plasma. To achieve the prescribed final equilibrium state, in general, additional energy, in the form of heat and work, is transferred between the atom and its surroundings. This additional relaxation energy is sufficient to explain the discrepancy between recent spectroscopic measurements of IPD in dense plasmas and the predictions of the SP formula. This paper provides a detailed account of an analytical approach, based on SP, to calculating thermodynamic and spectroscopic (adiabatic) IPDs in multicomponent Coulomb systems of arbitrary coupling strength with Te ≠ Ti. The ramifications for equilibrium Coulomb systems are examined in order to elucidate the roles of the various forms of the IPD and any possible connection with the plasma microfield. The formulation embodies an analytical equation of state (EoS) that is thermodynamically self-consistent, provided that the bound and free electrons are dynamically separable, meaning that the system is not undergoing pressure ionization. Apart from this restriction, the model is applicable in all coupling regimes. The Saha equation, which is generally considered to apply to weakly-coupled non-pressure-ionizing systems, is found to depend on the Thermodynamic IPD (TIPD), a form of the IPD which takes account of entropy changes. The average Static Continuum Lowering (SCL) of SP relates to changes in potential energy alone and features in EoS formulas that depend on the variation of the mean ionization state with respect to changes in volume or temperature. Of the various proposed formulas, the Spectroscopic (adiabatic) IPD (SIPD) gives the most consistent agreement with spectroscopic measurements.}, journal={High Energy Density Physics}, author={Crowley, B.

Accurate hydrodynamic modeling of such a two-temperature plasma requires an equation of state that captures the relevant many-body physics without assuming a strict local thermodynamic equilibrium. Several models have been proposed within the literature, which extend conventional statistical approaches, each employing a different combination of assumptions for modifying the equilibrium equations. In this work, we compare the predictions for several models, presenting derivations of the internal energy and pressure for each microscopic model within a unified framework so that the assumptions of each model may be more easily compared to one another. We find that for sufficiently weak coupling, all models agree with one another. However, as the coupling strength is increased, the disagreement between the models becomes more pronounced. Moreover, the relative sizes of the corrections predicted by each model depend on which species has the higher temperature, Te > Ti vs Te < Ti.}, number={11}, journal={Physics of Plasmas}, publisher={American Institute of Physics}, author={Triola, Christopher}, year={2022}, month={Nov}, pages={112705} }

Furthermore, under certain conditions the soft x-ray energy radiated in a 5 ns pulse at stagnation can exceed the estimated kinetic energy of the radial implosion phase by a factor of 3 to 4. A theoretical model is developed here to explain this, allowing the rapid conversion of magnetic energy to a very high ion temperature plasma through the generation of fine scale, fast-growing m=0 interchange MHD instabilities at stagnation. These saturate nonlinearly and provide associated ion viscous heating. Next the ion energy is transferred by equipartition to the electrons and thus to soft x-ray radiation. Recent time-resolved iron spectra at Sandia confirm an ion temperature Ti of over 200 keV (2×109 degrees), as predicted by theory.

Under these conditions, the method of free energy minimization can be used to allow for nonideal effects; this method ensures thermodynamic consistency among the material properties. A chemical picture is used in which atomic and molecular particles retain their identities. The free energy can then be expressed as the sum of several terms representing such effects as partial degeneracy of the electrons, Coulomb interactions among charged particles, finite-volume, hard sphere repulsion and van der Waals attraction, in addition to the usual terms representing the translational and internal degrees of freedom. An occupation probability formalism is used to represent the effects of the plasma in establishing a finite partition function, and attention is paid to representing these effects in a way that is consistent from the point of view of statistical mechanics. The use of the static screened Coulomb potential to calculate level shifts and to estimate the cutoff of the internal partition function is shown by elementary arguments to be invalid, a conclusion supported by spectroscopic data. For most of the parameter space relevant to stellar envelopes, perturbations arising from the plasma ions are shown to be dominant in establishing the internal partition functions. The effects on the partition function arising from rapid inelastic collision are also considered. The free energy is expressed in a way that can be differentiated analytically to facilitate its minimization and its subsequent use in deriving subsidiary thermodynamic quantities.}, journal={The Astrophysical Journal}, author={Hummer, D.

Modeling these plasmas challenges computational techniques and theories of non-equilibrium systems, so the field has attracted great interest from the theoretical and computational physics communities. By varying laser intensities and wavelengths it is possible to accurately set the initial plasma density and energy, and charged-particle-detection and optical diagnostics allow precise measurements for comparison with theoretical predictions. Recent experiments using optical probes demonstrated that ions in the plasma equilibrate in a strongly coupled fluid phase. Strongly coupled plasmas, in which the electrical interaction energy between charged particles exceeds the average kinetic energy, reverse the traditional energy hierarchy underlying basic plasma concepts such as Debye screening and hydrodynamics.

Rev. E 52, 5352 (1995). However, many dynamically produced plasmas have an electron temperature Te different from the ion temperature Ti. The study of these nonequilibrium (non-eq.) systems involves (i) calculation of a quasiequation of state (quasi-EOS) and the needed non-eq. correlation functions, e.g., the dynamic structure factors Sss′(k,ω), where s is the species index; and (ii) a calculation of relaxation processes. The energy and momentum relaxations are usually described in terms of coupling constants determining the rates of equilibriation. Simple Spitzer-type calculations of such coupling constants often use formulas obtained by averaging the damping of a single energetic particle by the medium. However, a different result is obtained for the energy-loss rate ⟨dHe/dt⟩ of the electron subsystem when calculated from the commutator mean value ⟨[He,H]−⟩, where He and H are the Hamiltonians of the electron subsystem and the total system. This result corresponds to energy relaxation via the interaction of the normal modes of the hot system with the normal modes of the cold system. Such a description is particularly appropriate for dense plasmas. The evaluation of the commutator mean values within the Fermi golden rule (FGR), or more sophisticated Keldysh or Zubarev methods, yields formulations involving the dynamic structure factors of the two subsystems. The single-particle and normal-mode methods are conceptually very different. Here we present calculations of the energy relaxation of dense uniform two-temperature aluminum plasmas, and compare the usual Spitzer-type estimates with our more detailed FGR-type results. Our results show that the relaxation rate is more than an order of magnitude smaller than that given by the commonly used theories.}, number={3}, journal={Physical Review E}, publisher={American Physical Society}, author={Dharma-Wardana, M.

NIF capabilities and infrastructure are in place to support its missions with nearly 60 X-ray, optical, and nuclear diagnostic systems. A primary goal of the National Ignition Campaign (NIC) on the NIF was to implode a low-Z capsule filled with ∼0.2 mg of deuterium-tritium (DT) fuel via laser indirect-drive inertial confinement fusion and demonstrate fusion ignition and propagating thermonuclear burn with a net energy gain of ∼5–10 (fusion yield/input laser energy). This requires assembling the DT fuel into a dense shell of ∼1000 g/cm3 with an areal density (ρR) of ∼1.5 g/cm2, surrounding a lower density hot spot with a temperature of ∼10 keV and a ρR ∼0.3 g/cm2, or approximately an α-particle range. Achieving these conditions demand precise control of laser and target parameters to allow a low adiabat, high convergence implosion with low ablator fuel mix.

The review focuses on the evolution of scientific understanding gained from target-physics experiments in many areas, identifying problems that were demonstrated and the solutions implemented. The review starts with the basic understanding of laser–plasma interactions that was obtained before the declassification of laser-induced compression in the early 1970s and continues with the compression experiments using infrared lasers in the late 1970s that produced thermonuclear neutrons. The problem of suprathermal electrons and the target preheat that they caused, associated with the infrared laser wavelength, led to lasers being built after 1980 to operate at shorter wavelengths, especially 0.35 μm—the third harmonic of the Nd:glass laser—and 0.248 μm (the KrF gas laser). The main physics areas relevant to direct drive are reviewed. The primary absorption mechanism at short wavelengths is classical inverse bremsstrahlung. Nonuniformities imprinted on the target by laser irradiation have been addressed by the development of a number of beam-smoothing techniques and imprint-mitigation strategies. The effects of hydrodynamic instabilities are mitigated by a combination of imprint reduction and target designs that minimize the instability growth rates. Several coronal plasma physics processes are reviewed. The two-plasmon–decay instability, stimulated Brillouin scattering (together with cross-beam energy transfer), and (possibly) stimulated Raman scattering are identified as potential concerns, placing constraints on the laser intensities used in target designs, while other processes (self-focusing and filamentation, the parametric decay instability, and magnetic fields), once considered important, are now of lesser concern for mainline direct-drive target concepts. Filamentation is largely suppressed by beam smoothing. Thermal transport modeling, important to the interpretation of experiments and to target design, has been found to be nonlocal in nature. Advances in shock timing and equation-of-state measurements relevant to direct-drive ICF are reported. Room-temperature implosions have provided an increased understanding of the importance of stability and uniformity. The evolution of cryogenic implosion capabilities, leading to an extensive series carried out on the 60-beam OMEGA laser [Boehly et al., Opt. Commun. 133, 495 (1997)], is reviewed together with major advances in cryogenic target formation. A polar-drive concept has been developed that will enable direct-drive–ignition experiments to be performed on the National Ignition Facility [Haynam et al., Appl. Opt. 46(16), 3276 (2007)]. The advantages offered by the alternative approaches of fast ignition and shock ignition and the issues associated with these concepts are described. The lessons learned from target-physics and implosion experiments are taken into account in ignition and high-gain target designs for laser wavelengths of 1/3 μm and 1/4 μm. Substantial advances in direct-drive inertial fusion reactor concepts are reviewed. Overall, the progress in scientific understanding over the past five decades has been enormous, to the point that inertial fusion energy using direct drive shows significant promise as a future environmentally attractive energy source.}, number={11}, journal={Physics of Plasmas}, publisher={American Institute of Physics}, author={Craxton, R.

Since the ions gain a large amount of kinetic energy while building up negative potential energy, plasmas are usually heated to a moderately coupled state that is almost independent of the initial temperature. We show how this process is related to the establishment of Coulomb structure in the final plasma state. Several possibilities for reducing the heating by the introduction of structure in the initial state, i.e., the gas before ionization, are then discussed. (© 2003 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We give an overview of UNP experiments with an emphasis on measurements of the time-evolving ion density and velocity distributions, the electron-ion thermalization rate, and plasma self-assembly—all just inside the strongly coupled plasma regime. We also present theoretical and computational models that were developed to understand a subset of HEDP experiments. However, because HEDP experiments display similar degrees of strong coupling, many aspects of these models can be vetted using precision studies of UNPs. This comparison is important because some statistical assumptions used for ideal plasmas are of questionable validity in the strongly coupled plasma regime. We summarize two theoretical approaches that extend kinetic theories into the strong-coupling regime and show good agreement for momentum transfer and self-diffusion. As capabilities improve, both computationally and experimentally, UNP measurements may help guide the ongoing development of HEDP-appropriate plasma models.

We consider the limit of gases whose relaxation time is extremely fast so that the gases contained in the left and right chambers of the piston are always in equilibrium (that is, the molecules are uniformly distributed and their velocities obey the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution) after any collision with the piston. Then by using kinetic theory we derive the collision statistics, from which we obtain a set of ordinary differential equations for the evolution of the macroscopic observables (namely, the piston average velocity and position, the velocity variance, and the temperatures of the two compartments). The dynamics of these equations is compared with simulations of an ideal gas and a microscopic model of a gas devised to verify the assumptions used in the derivation. We show that the equations predict an evolution for the macroscopic variables that catches the basic features of the problem.

In particular, deuterium-tritium (DT) and proton–boron11 (pB11) are considered for pre-compressed plasma. The ignition criterion is described by a surface in the three-dimensional space defined by the electron and ion temperatures Te, Ti, and the plasma density times the hot spot dimension, ρ·R. The appropriate fusion ion temperatures Ti are larger than 10 keV for DT and 150 keV for pB11. The required value of ρ·R for pB11 ignition is larger by a factor of 50 or more than for DT, depending on the electron temperature. Furthermore, our ignition criterion obtained here for pB11 fusion is practically impossible for equal electron and ion temperatures. In this paper it is suggested to use a two temperature laser induced shock wave in the intermediate domain between relativistic and non-relativistic shock waves. The laser parameters required for fast ignition are calculated. In particular, we find that for \uppercase{DT} case one needs a 3 kJ/1 ps laser to ignite a pre-compressed target at about 600 g/cm3.

Laser-driven implosions of spherical polymer shells have, for example, achieved an increase in density of 1,000 times relative to the solid state5. These densities are large enough to enable controlled fusion, but to achieve energy gain a small volume of compressed fuel (known as the ‘spark’) must be heated to temperatures of about 108 K (corresponding to thermal energies in excess of 10 keV). In the conventional approach to controlled fusion, the spark is both produced and heated by accurately timed shock waves4, but this process requires both precise implosion symmetry and a very large drive energy. In principle, these requirements can be significantly relaxed by performing the compression and fast heating separately6,7,8,9,10; however, this ‘fast ignitor’ approach7 also suffers drawbacks, such as propagation losses and deflection of the ultra-intense laser pulse by the plasma surrounding the compressed fuel. Here we employ a new compression geometry that eliminates these problems; we combine production of compressed matter in a laser-driven implosion with picosecond-fast heating by a laser pulse timed to coincide with the peak compression.

To minimize the drive energy for ignition, the imploding shell of DT fuel must be kept as cold as possible. Such low-adiabat ICF implosions can access to coupled and degenerate plasma conditions, in which the analytical EOS models become inaccurate due to many-body effects. Using the path-integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations we have derived a first-principles EOS (FPEOS) table of deuterium that covers typical ICF fuel conditions at densities ranging from 0.002 to 1596 g/cm3 and temperatures of 1.35 eV to 5.5 keV. We report the internal energy and the pressure and discuss the structure of the plasma in terms of pair-correlation functions. When compared with the widely used SESAME table and the revised Kerley03 table, discrepancies in the internal energy and in the pressure are identified for moderately coupled and degenerate plasma conditions. In contrast to the SESAME table, the revised Kerley03 table is in better agreement with our FPEOS results over a wide range of densities and temperatures. Although subtle differences still exist for lower temperatures (T < 10 eV) and moderate densities (1 to 10 g/cm3), hydrodynamics simulations of cryogenic ICF implosions using the FPEOS table and the Kerley03 table have resulted in similar results for the peak density, areal density (ρR), and neutron yield, which differ significantly from the SESAME simulations.}, number={22}, journal={Physical Review B}, publisher={American Physical Society}, author={Hu, S.

As power is diverted to fast ions and then to ions, a number of effects come into play, as the relative amounts of pressure taken up by electrons, fuel ions and fast alpha particles shift. In addition, if the alpha particle power is diverted to fast fuel ions, there is an enhanced fusion reactivity because of the non-thermal component of the ion distribution. Some useful expressions for describing these effects are derived, and it is shown that fusion reactors with power density about twice what otherwise might be obtained can be contemplated, so long as a substantial amount of the alpha particle power can be diverted. Interestingly, in this mode of operation, once the electron heat is sufficiently confined, further improvement in confinement is actually not desirable.

KGaA, Weinheim}, ISSN={1521-3986}, DOI={10.1002/ctpp.201900161}, abstractNote={A new concept called “configurational temperature” is introduced in the context of dusty plasma, where the temperature of the dust particles submerged in the plasma can be measured directly from the positional information of the individual dust particles and the interaction potential between the dust grains. This method does not require the velocity information of individual particles, which is a key parameter to measure the dust temperature in the conventional method. The technique is initially tested using two-dimensional (2D) OpenMP parallel molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulation and then compared with the temperature evaluated from experimental data. The experiment have been carried out in the Dusty Plasma Experimental (DPEx) device, where a 2D stationary plasma crystal of melamine formaldehyde particles is formed in the cathode sheath of a DC glow discharge argon plasma. The kinetic temperature of the dust is calculated using the standard particle image velocimetry technique at different pressures. An extended simulation result for the three-dimensional case is also presented, which can be employed for the temperature measurement of a three-dimensional dust crystal in laboratory devices.}, number={4}, journal={Contributions to Plasma Physics}, author={Mukherjee, R. and Jaiswal, S. and Shukla, M.

Confinement effects are taken into account by using perfectly reflecting boundary conditions in MD simulations. An equation of state relating pressure to number density is obtained. The results of the MD simulations show that in the weak coupling regime, pressure of confined Yukawa gas is much larger than the kinetic pressure and scales quadratically with number density.

At the same time, this state is extremely difficult to treat theoretically. This is due to the simultaneous appearance of quantum degeneracy, Coulomb correlations, and thermal effects, as well as the overlap of plasma and condensed phases. Recent breakthroughs are due to the successful application of density functional theory (DFT) methods which, however, often lack the necessary accuracy and predictive capability for WDM applications. The situation has changed with the availability of the first ab initio data for the exchange–correlation free energy of the warm dense uniform electron gas (UEG) that were obtained by quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations; for recent reviews, see Dornheim et al., Phys. Plasmas 24, 056303 (2017) and Phys. Rep. 744, 1–86 (2018). In the present article, we review recent further progress in QMC simulations of the warm dense UEG: namely, ab initio results for the static local field correction G(q) and for the dynamic structure factor S(q,ω). These data are of key relevance for comparison with x-ray scattering experiments at free electron laser facilities and for the improvement of theoretical models. In the second part of this paper, we discuss the simulations of WDM out of equilibrium. The theoretical approaches include Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics, quantum kinetic theory, time-dependent DFT, and hydrodynamics. Here, we analyze the strengths and limitations of these methods and argue that progress in WDM simulations will require a suitable combination of all methods. A particular role might be played by quantum hydrodynamics, and we concentrate on problems, recent progress, and possible improvements of this method.}, number={4}, journal={Physics of Plasmas}, author={Bonitz, M. and Dornheim, T. and Moldabekov, Zh.

The new method is particularly suitable to dealing with the interaction of long-range character, such as Coulomb potential, since it suffers from no divergence difficulties contrary to the conventional one. As an application of the method, the equilibrium properties of high temperature plasma is studied and the term of next higher orders than the Debye-Hückel limiting law is obtained exactly. The order estimation indicates that the Debye-Hückel law is accurate within the error of a few per cent in this case. A possible extension of the present method to the theory of non-equilibrium properties of plasma or to quantum statistic is suggested.}, number={2}, journal={Progress of Theoretical Physics}, author={Abe, R.}, year={1959}, month={Aug}, pages={213–226} }

This arrangement can, in principle, lead to higher gains than conventional ignition produced by stagnation of convergent flows. In addition, because ignition is separate from the implosion in fast ignition, hydrodynamic mix has less opportunity to quench ignition than in the conventional process. This paper introduces some of the basic ideas of fast ignition: ignition requirements, gain curves based on simple energetic models, and integrated gain models including hohlraum and implosion physics. Because possible gains in this approach are so large, it is possible to examine the use of fuels with small tritium fractions, the so-called “advanced fuels.” In addition, the historical background of this field is discussed.}, number={3}, journal={Fusion Science and Technology}, publisher={Taylor & Francis}, author={Tabak, Max and Hinkel, Denise and Atzeni, Stefano and Campbell, E.

  @article{Ichimaru_1993, title={Nuclear fusion in dense plasmas}, volume={65}, DOI={10.1103/RevModPhys.65.255}, abstractNote={The review begins by grouping the fundamental nuclear reactions into two classifications, namely, the usual binary processes and few-particle processes. In the few-particle processes, the possibility of electron-screened cold fusion is remarked. The special features of dense plasmas rest in the enhancement of reaction rates over these fundamental processes due to internuclear many-particle processes. The manyparticle processes arise from a modification of the short-range correlations between reacting nuclei and are the effects related closely to differences between Coulombic chemical potentials before and after the nuclear reactions. Quantum statistical-mechanical formulation of the enhancement factors is presented. Thermodynamic functions for various realizations of dense plasmas, pertinent directly to the reaction-rate theories through the screening properties and free energies, are summarized. Those analyses are then applied to the estimation of nuclear reaction rates in specific examples of dense astrophysical plasmas, namely, the Sun, brown dwarfs, giant planets, white-dwarf progenitors of supernovae, and helium burning on the degenerate stars, as well as in those dense laboratory plasmas that are found in the inertial confinement fusion experiments, in metal hydrides such as PdD and TiD2, in cluster-impact fusion experiments, and in ultrahigh-pressure liquid metals. The essential similarity between the nuclear fusion reactions in supernovae and those projected in the ultrahigh-pressure liquid metals is particularly emphasized.}, number={2}, journal={Reviews of Modern Physics}, publisher={American Physical Society}, author={Ichimaru, Setsuo}, year={1993}, month={Apr}, pages={255–299} }

We consider the density-temperature combinations which are called the weak-screening, strong-screening, and pycnonuclear regimes. Except in the pycnonuclear case we express our results in the form of “correction factors” with which one multiplies the ordinary thermonuclear reaction rate evaluated at the same temperature and density. By considering the extreme cases of Zi — Z2 and Zi » Z2, where Zi and Z2 are the atomic numbers of the two reacting nuclei, we are able to devise interpolation formulae which are valid for any ratio of charges Zi/Z2 throughout the entire weak- and strong-screening regimes. We also discuss strong-screening corrections to resonant nuclear reaction rates, and we give an explicit formula for the important special case of the triple-alpha reaction. Finally, by applying our results to the case of the proton chain, we show that the hydrogen abundance in the white dwarf Sirius B must be less than 3.5 X 10~5.}, journal={The Astrophysical Journal}, author={Salpeter, E.

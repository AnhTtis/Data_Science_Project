    "abstract": "A cactus is a connected graph in which any two cycles have at most one common vertex. We determine the unique graph that maximizes the distance spectral radius over all cacti with fixed numbers of vertices and cycles, and thus prove a conjecture on the distance spectral radius of cacti in [S.S. Bose, M. Nath, S. Paul, On the distance spectral radius of cacti, Linear Algebra Appl. 437 (2012) 2128--2141]. We prove the result in the context of hypertrees.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by the high energy focusing found in rapidly collapsing bubbles that is relevant to implosion processes that concentrate energy density, such as sonoluminescence, we consider a calculation of an empty cavity collapse in a compressible Euler fluid. We review and then use the method based on similarity theory that was previously used to compute the power law exponent $n$ for the collapse of an empty cavity in water during the late stage of the collapse. We extend this calculation by considering different fluids surrounding the cavity, all of which are parametrized by the Tait-Murnaghan equation of state through parameter $γ$. As a result, we obtain the dependence of $n$ on $γ$ for a wide range of $γ$, and indeed see that the collapse is sensitive to the equation of state of an outside fluid.",

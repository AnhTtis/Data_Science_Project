\section{Test Visualization Examples}~\label{sec:appendix}
We display some visualization examples, including original and privacy-preserving visualizations used in our Study 1 (Figure~\ref{fig:study1a_eg}) and Study 2 (Figure~\ref{fig:study2_sample}).

Note: The visualization effect may vary due to different screen resolutions compared to those on the phones used in Study 2.}

\section{Experiment Material Examples}~\label{sec:appendix}
We display some visualization examples, including original and privacy-preserving visualizations used in our Study 1 (Figure~\ref{fig:study1a_eg}) and Study 2 (Figure~\ref{fig:study2_sample}).

    \caption{A comparison of (a) original visualizations and (b) transformed visualizations with adjustment on both spatial frequency and luminance contrast. Note: due to the varying screen resolutions, the displayed visualization effect may differ from that on the phones in Study 1.}

    \caption{Four visualization samples used in Study 2: (a) original visualizations, (b) visualizations with masking and border, (c) visualizations with masking. Since the border is only available for the area-based mark, the displayed line chart is the same in (b) and (c). Note: due to the varying screen resolutions, the displayed visualization effect may differ from that on the phones in Study 2.}

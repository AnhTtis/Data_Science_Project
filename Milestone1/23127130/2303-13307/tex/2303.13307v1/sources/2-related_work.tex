With the wide application of data visualization, there has been a growing trend of research on the privacy preservation of data visualizations.

According to Bhattacharjee~\textit{et al.}~\cite{bhattacharjee2020privacy}, these data anonymization techniques can be divided into two groups: (1) data uncertainty and (2) visual uncertainty. Data uncertainty-based methods remove or modify a portion of the original dataset to ensure that a specific number of data records are indistinguishable and thereby stop sensitive the exposure of sensitive individual data items~\cite{sweeney2002k,bayardo2005data}.

% As a result, visualizations used with the modified dataset are unable to reveal sensitive data. 
% Some studies apply this kind of method to visualization in the visualization field.

Similarly, Okansen \textit{et al.}~\cite{oksanen2015methods} introduced a privacy-preserving heatmap for trajectory data, where three data processing techniques are presented to prevent the data owner's identity disclosure from being identified in the heatmap. 
In contrast to data uncertainty, visual uncertainty based data anonymization approaches involve uncertainty in the mapping between data points and visualizations.
For instance, Dasgupta~\textit{et al.}~\cite{dasgupta2013measuring} proposed a method for clustering similar data points, binning them according to their value ranges, and displaying these data in parallel coordinate views. Chou~\textit{et al.}~\cite{chou2016obfuscated} obfuscated data rendering in scientific visualizations, and the visualizations can prevent unauthorized viewers from seeing the detailed data items.

\subsection{Shoulder-surfing Protection on Mobile Devices}

% \dm{what not introduce shoulder-surfing in the intro, this is exactly the scenario you are trying to address.}. 

% In public areas (e.g., trains, cafes), shoulder surfacers can easily view the screen of another person's mobile device and gather sensitive information from the screen. To address the shoulder surfacing attacks on mobile devices, researchers have proposed different approaches and they 
According to Chen~\textit{et al.}~\cite{chen2019keep},
prior studies on shoulder-surfing protection can be categorized into three types: interpretation barrier, shoulder surfer alter, and information blocking.
The interpretation barrier method does not stop shoulder surfers from observing sensitive information but slows down the information leakage on the mobile screen. As a result, sensitive data is displayed in a specific format that the data owner can only understand. For example, Von Zezschwitz~\textit{et al.}~\cite{von2016you} recommended using graphic distortion filters to protect private images in smartphone photo galleries. Distortion filters made it easy for the user (i.e., the image owner) to recognize the content but difficult for the shoulder surfer to comprehend. Similarly, Gouveia~\textit{et al.}~\cite{gouveia2016exploring} designed an alternative metaphor (i.e., a growth garden) to represent physical activity progress. Alternatively, the methods of shoulder surfer alter  use sensors in a mobile device to detect if anyone is nearby and trying to peek at the user's mobile device screen~\cite{ryu2017electronic,ali2014protecting}. For example, Ryu~\textit{et al.}~\cite{ryu2017electronic} leverages face recognition technology and the front camera to detect whether people around the user are peeking at the mobile screen.
% iScreen utilizes the font camera and light sensor of a mobile device to detect the external environment and then adjusts the displayed content settings accordingly (e.g., font size, screen brightness)~\cite{lei2021iscreen}. Thus, the modified display settings may reduce the shoulder surfer's readability, but users can read the content with little difficulty. Furthermore, the information blocking techniques can enable users to conceal their on-screen information from shoulder surfers. For example, adding a privacy film to a mobile device screen can protect users' information on the screen, but it incurs additional expenses. 
The information blocking method aims to conceal the actual information on the screen when shoulder surfers view it. For instance, adding a privacy film to a mobile device screen can protect users' information on the screen, but it incurs additional expenses.  
In contrast to the hardware method, IllusionPin~\cite{papadopoulos2017illusionpin} blends real and fake keypads using the hybrid image~\cite{oliva2006hybrid}. As a result, users can read the actual keypad, while shoulder surfers can only see the fake keypad.  In addition to PIN keypad protection, HideScreen utilizes the optical system to blend screen content into the background, thus preventing shoulder surfing~\cite{chen2019keep}. Nevertheless, IllusionPin is only available for a specific image type (i.e., mobile keypads), and HideScreen only works with grayscale nature images that sacrifice color information.
Unlike prior studies above, our approach targets privacy preservation for mobile data visualizations, which are colorful and different from natural images.
% To bridge the research gap between privacy protection and colored mobile visualizations, we propose a novel masking scheme for the visualization. The scheme can transform a standard visualization into a visualization that prevents shoulder surfing attacks. In addition to working for colored visualization, the method is applicable to a variety of visualization types and hence is not limited to a single visualization type.
% In light of this, we propose a novel masking scheme that allows a user to view the information clearly (at close proximity) and prevents unauthorized third parties from viewing the screen (from a distance).

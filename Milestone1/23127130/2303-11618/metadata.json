    "abstract": "An almost complex torus manifold is a $2n$-dimensional compact connected almost complex manifold equipped with an effective action of a real $n$-dimensional torus $T^n \\simeq (S^1)^n$ that has fixed points. For an almost complex torus manifold, there is a labeled directed graph which contains information on weights at the fixed points and isotropy spheres.\n  Let $M$ be a 6-dimensional almost complex torus manifold with Euler number 6. We show that two types of graphs occur for $M$, and for each type of graph we construct such a manifold $M$, proving the existence. Using the graphs, we determine the Chern numbers and the Hirzebruch $χ_y$-genus of $M$.",

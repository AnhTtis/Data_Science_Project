    "abstract": "Notwithstanding great strides that statistical mechanics has made in recent decades, an analytic solution of arguably the simplest model of relaxation dynamics, the Ising model in an applied external field remains elusive even in $1d$. Extant studies are based on numerics using single-spin-flip Glauber dynamics. There is no reason why this algorithm should lead to the global minimum energy state of the system. With this in mind, we explore multi-spin-flip parallel and sequential Glauber dynamics of Ising spins in $1d$ and also on a regular random graph of coordination number $z=3$. We view our study as a small initial step to test the generally implied hypothesis that the equilibrium is independent of the relaxational dynamics or if it carries some signature of it.",

    "abstract": "`ronswanson` provides a simple-to-use framework for building so-called table or template models for `astromodels`the modeling package for multi-messenger astrophysical data-analysis framework, `3ML`. With `astromodels` and `3ML` one can build the interpolation table of a physical model result of an expensive computer simulation. This then enables efficient reevaluation of the model while, for example, fitting it to a dataset. While `3ML` and `astromodels` provide factories for building table models, the construction of pipelines for models that must be run on high-performance computing (HPC) systems can be cumbersome. `ronswanson` removes this complexity with a simple, reproducible templating system. Users can easily prototype their pipeline on multi-core workstations and then switch to a multi-node HPC system. `ronswanson` automatically generates the required `Python` and `SLURM` scripts to scale the execution of `3ML` with `astromodel`'s table models on an HPC system.",

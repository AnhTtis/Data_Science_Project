%   \caption{Overview of the architecture of IGCCF. On the left, the graph projection module converts the user-item bipartite graph into a homogeneous item-item graph. Next, the item embedding module takes a randomly initialised item embedding ${\mathbf{X}}^{(0)}$ and produces refined item embeddings ${\mathbf{X}}^{(k)}$ after several graph convolution iterations. In the user embedding module we represent users ${\mathbf{U}}$ as a combination of the embeddings of the items they interact with. Finally, the recommendations $\tilde{{\mathbf{Y}}}$ are computed as a dot product of the learned user and item embeddings.}

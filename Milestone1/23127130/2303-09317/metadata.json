    "abstract": "The classical Lotka-Volterra predator-prey system is often used in species competition modeling. An exact, closed-form solution is derived when the natural growth rate of the prey species and decay rate of the predators are equal in magnitude. A standard functional transformation yields a novel system of two partially uncoupled rst-order ODEs for \\hybrid-species\", with one being autonomous. New exact, closed-form time-dependent solutions are derived for each individual species. An analytical expression for the system's oscillation period valid for any value of the system's energy is derived in terms of a novel universal function.",

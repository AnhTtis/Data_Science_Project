Quince slices with an average initial moisture content of 81\% in wet basis (w.b.) or 4.27 kgwater/kgdry matter in dry basis (d.b.), were dried in a laboratory thermal convective dryer and experimental data of moisture content versus drying time was obtained for nine measurement groups of 40, 50 and 60 °C drying air temperature and 1, 2 and 3 m/s airﬂow velocity respectively. Diﬀerent topologies of multilayer perceptron (MLP) ANN models containing a single or two hidden layers with a diﬀerent number of hidden neurons and diﬀerent types of transfer functions, have been investigated for predicting the moisture content evolution during drying. A group k-fold cross validation iteration procedure was performed for each developed ANN structure, in order to assess each model’s ability to estimate the moisture content of quinces on unseen data of air-drying temperature and airﬂow velocity combinations held out of the training process. For the cross validation of the developed ANN models, appropriate statistical evaluation indices were applied. The best performed ANN model based on the cross validation score metrics, contained two hidden layers with the sigmoid, softplus transfer functions and was composed by 90 artiﬁcial hidden neurons in each of the two hidden layers. A satisfying agreement of predictions with the experimental data was noticed, achieving coeﬃcients of determination (R2) greater than 99\% and root mean square error (RMSE) values less than 0.08 kgwater/kgdry matter.},

	abstract = {The present study involved integration of artificial neural network (ANN) with genetic algorithm (GA) for predicting the optimized process parameters required for fluidized bed drying of green tea leaves. It had a layer each for input and output with linear activation function and two hidden layers with a sigmoid function. The feed forward back propagation method was used to train the developed model. The input parameters used by ANN for generalizing the drying process were temperature (50–80 C) and air flow velocity (7–9.5 m/s), and the output parameters were drying time, total color difference (TCD), and total phenolic content (TPC). The weights and bias values of trained ANN were used by GA to estimate the fitness function, which maximizes the TPC and minimizes the drying time and TCD. The optimum process condition of independent variables (80 C and 9 m/s) obtained from the hybrid ANN/GA was validated, and agreeable relationship between actual and predicted values with relative standard deviation (SD) of 5.7, 0.46, and 0.22 was found for drying time, TCD and TPC of dried leaves, respectively. Hence, under this optimal drying condition, best quality green tea can be obtained within the limits defined.},

A comparative study was performed among nonlinear regression techniques, fuzzy logic and artificial neural networks to estimate the dynamic drying behavior of onion. Among nine mathematical models, approximation of diffusion with R2 = 0.9999 and root mean square error = 0.004157 showed the best fit with experimental data. Fuzzy logic tool in MATLAB with Mamdani model in the form of If–Then rules along with triangular membership function used for simulation, interpolation and obtaining a theoretical increase in experimental moisture ratios were used. Feedforward–backpropagation neural system with application of Levenberg–Marquardt training algorithm, hyperbolic tangent sigmoid transfer function, training cycle of 1,000 epoch and 2-5-1 topology was determined as the best neural model in terms of statistical indices. Practical Applications Forecasting kinetics of food drying by application of precise mathematical and dynamic modeling techniques as well as preparing particular patterns for describing such drying behaviors of diverse food products seem unavoidable for processing factories to optimize the quality of their dried food products and reduce operational costs. For this purpose, in this study, we applied different temperatures and airflow velocities to dry onion by a custom designed fluidized bed dryer equipped with a heat pump dehumidifier, predicting its drying behavior by regression, fuzzy logic and artificial neural network techniques and comparing accuracy of those models. Also, this paper compares prediction patterns of drying onion by fluidized bed drying with those of other food products dried by various drying methods. The results of this study will be helpful for all researchers and producers who want to know more about the nuances of impacts of different fluidized bed drying variables on the patterns of heat and mass transfer in fruits and vegetables.},

	abstract = 	 {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer’s inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization, and in some cases eliminates the need for Dropout. Applied to a stateof-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.82% top-5 test error, exceeding the accuracy of human raters.}

Cellulose pulp dryness estimate through near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy coupled with multivariate regressions or artificial neural network (ANN) techniques are not well explored yet. In this study models were developed to estimate cellulose pulp dryness in pads based on the NIR spectra. Thus, the cellulose pulp pads (4 mm thick) were weighed and their NIR spectra were obtained in several stages during desorption from 13.1 to 98.3% of content of solids. Partial least square regression (PLS-R) was developed from whole NIR spectra (1300 Absorbance values) and six spectral variables (from 1300) were selected for developing the PLS-R (6) and the ANN model. Both trained neural network and regression can predict pulp dryness of unknown cellulose pulp pads from their NIR data with an error of 2.5%. PLS-R models based on whole NIR spectra showed accurate predictions (the R² of lab-determined and estimated values plot was 0.99) while the ANN showed the same predictive performance from only six NIR variables. Predictive models developed from full NIR spectra and those based on only 6 variables were compared. Our findings indicate that NIR spectroscopy coupled with multivariate analysis and Artificial neural networks are a promising tool for monitoring the weight variation due to dewatering of the cellulose pulps in real time.}

   abstract = {In this study, three different apple cultivars were dried using five different drying methods and moisture ratio (MR), moisture content (MC) and drying rate values were determined. Then, different machine learning algorithms (artificial neural network, k-nearest neighbors, random forest, gaussian processes, and support vector regression) were used to estimate MR, MC and drying rate. For MR estimation of Golden Delicious, Oregon Spur and Granny Smith cultivars, Random Forest was most successful algorithm with correlation coefficients (R) of 0.9800, 0.9873, and 0.9841, respectively. This was followed by SVR with R: 0.9323 for Golden Delicious, ANN with R: 0.9766 for Oregon Spur and 5-NN with R: 0.9827 for Granny Smith. MC and drying rate estimation results showed that RF, SVR, and k-NN achieved higher R for all cultivars. It was concluded that machine learning algorithms are an effective approach for the accurate estimation of the drying characteristics of apple slices. Practical applications: Machine learning-like precise modeling techniques are used to estimate the drying characteristics of agricultural commodities. Models should be assessed and compared for optimization of drying conditions and operational costs.

@article{Amini2021,
   abstract = {In this study, genetic algorithm–artificial neural network (GA-ANN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) models were used for the prediction of drying time (DT) and moisture ratio (MR) of basil seed mucilage (BSM) in an infrared (IR) dryer. The GA-ANN and ANFIS were fed with three inputs of IR radiation power, the distance of mucilage from lamp surface, and mucilage thickness for the prediction of average DT. Also, to predict the MR, these models were fed with four inputs of IR power, lamp distance, mucilage thickness, and treatment time. The developed GA–ANN, which included eight hidden neurons, could predict the DT of BSM with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.97. Also, the GA–ANN model with 10 neurons in 1 hidden layer, could predict the MR with a high r value (r = 0.99). The calculated r values for the prediction of DT and MR using the ANFIS-based subtractive clustering algorithm were 0.96 and 0.99, respectively. Sensitivity analysis results showed that mucilage thickness and treatment time were the most sensitive factor for the prediction of DT and MR of BSM drying, respectively. Practical applications: Advantages of infrared radiation over convective heating include high heat transfer coefficients, short process times, and low energy costs. Dried seeds mucilage are hydrophilic molecules and they can used as functional ingredients in food products formulation for improving food viscosity and consistency, and controlling the microstructure, texture, flavor, and shelf life. Both GA-ANN and ANFIS models predictions agreed well with testing data sets and they could be useful for understanding and controlling the factors affecting on drying kinetics of BSM in an IR dryer.},

   abstract = {Infrared drying (IRD) was used for the dehydration process of rose petals for the purpose of improving drying efficiency as well as retaining product quality. A methodology to predict the antioxidant capacities of rose petals which include DPPH, ABTS radical scavenging capacities and ferric-ion reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) values during infrared drying (IRD) was established in this study. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) and back propagation-artificial neural network (BP-ANN) modelling were used to establish the relationships between the near infrared (NIR) spectrum and the antioxidant capacities. Results of model fitting showed that BP-ANN model displayed higher prediction accuracy than PLSR model for determining the DPPH, ABTS radical scavenging capacities and FRAP of rose petals during IRD based on NIR spectral data. The results obtained indicate that NIR spectroscopic parameters combined with multivariate calibration could be used reliably to predict the antioxidant capacities of IR-dried rose petals via appropriate mathematical models.},

@generic{Yang2022,
   abstract = {The microwave-assisted thermal process is a high-efficiency drying method and is promising to be applied in the food industry. However, the prediction of the thermal treatment results from such a dynamic and complicated process can be difficult. Additionally, the determination of the optimal drying parameters, such as drying temperature, microwave power, and drying time for optimized performance can also be hard. Recently, extensive research has been focusing on the use of artificial neural network (ANN) models in the laboratory-scale microwave drying processes and has shown the feasibility of such application. As a regression tool, the ANN models have been widely used in predicting drying performance; when integrated with additional optimizing algorithms, the ANN models could be used for drying parameter optimization; and when combined with real-time measuring techniques (e.g. nuclear magnetic resonance), the ANN models could be used for monitoring and controlling the drying process in a dynamic sense. Future research could focus on testing the developed ANN models in industrial-scale microwave drying processes and applying the ANN models in microwave drying kinetics research for optimizing the dynamic drying processes. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.},

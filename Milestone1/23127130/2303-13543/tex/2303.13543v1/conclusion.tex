\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we define a network index named subgraph entropy and define the corresponding graph kernel. We commerce by re-deriving the cluster expansion formula and designing a subgraph mining algorithm for labeled graphlet counting with low complexity. Driven by the combination of node feature, local structure, and global distribution, our method realizes the accurate representation of several real-world graph datasets. Our method enjoys competitive advantages with other state-of-the-art graph kernels on biochemistry datasets and demonstrates an excellent effect on financial outlier detection. Hereafter, we intend to reveal the different roles that each subgraph plays and explore the implicit relations between these subgraphs.

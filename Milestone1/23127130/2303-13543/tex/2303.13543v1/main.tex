% <-this % stops an unwanted space
}

% note the % following the last \IEEEmembership and also \thanks - 
% these prevent an unwanted space from occurring between the last author name
% and the end of the author line. i.e., if you had this:
% 
% \author{....lastname \thanks{...} \thanks{...} }
%                     ^------------^------------^----Do not want these spaces!
%
% a space would be appended to the last name and could cause every name on that
% line to be shifted left slightly. This is one of those "LaTeX things". For
% instance, "\textbf{A} \textbf{B}" will typeset as "A B" not "AB". To get
% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as
% you are supposed to have spaces between the names. For what it is worth,
% this is a minor point as most people would not even notice if the said evil
% space somehow managed to creep in.

\begin{abstract}
In recent years, kernel methods are widespread in tasks of similarity measuring. Specifically, graph kernels are widely used in fields of bioinformatics, chemistry and financial data analysis. However, existing methods, especially entropy based graph kernels are subject to large computational complexity and the negligence of node-level information. In this paper, we propose a novel labeled subgraph entropy graph kernel, which performs well in structural similarity assessment. We design a dynamic programming subgraph enumeration algorithm, which effectively reduces the time complexity. Specially, we propose labeled subgraph, which enriches substructure topology with semantic information. Analogizing the cluster expansion process of gas cluster in statistical mechanics, we re-derive the partition function and calculate the global graph entropy to characterize the network. In order to test our method, we apply several real-world datasets and assess the effects in different tasks. To capture more experiment details, we quantitatively and qualitatively analyze the contribution of different topology structures. Experimental results successfully demonstrate the effectiveness of our method which outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.

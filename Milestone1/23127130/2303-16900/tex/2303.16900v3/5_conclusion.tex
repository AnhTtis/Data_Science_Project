\section{Conclusion}
\vspace{-1mm}
In this work, we propose an effective and efficient CNN architecture, InceptionNeXt, which enjoys a better trade-off between the practical speed and the performance than previous network architectures. 
InceptionNeXt decomposes large-kernel depthwise convolution along channel dimension into four parallel branches, including identity mapping, a small square kernel, and two orthogonal band kernels. All these four branches are much more computationally efficient than a large-kernel depthwise convolution in practice, and can also work together to have a large spatial receptive field for good performance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance and the high practical efficiency of InceptionNeXt.

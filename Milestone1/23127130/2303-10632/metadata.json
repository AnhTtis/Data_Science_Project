    "abstract": "Imaging flow cytometry systems aim to analyze a huge number of cells or micro-particles based on their physical characteristics. The vast majority of current systems acquire a large amount of images which are used to train deep artificial neural networks. However, this approach increases both the latency and power consumption of the final apparatus. In this work-in-progress, we combine an event-based camera with a free-space optical setup to obtain spikes for each particle passing in a microfluidic channel. A spiking neural network is trained on the collected dataset, resulting in 97.7% mean training accuracy and 93.5% mean testing accuracy for the fully event-based classification pipeline.",

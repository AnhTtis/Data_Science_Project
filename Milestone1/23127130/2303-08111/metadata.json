    "abstract": "We compute the differentials of a few elements of Sinha's spectral sequence for cohomology of the space of long knots modulo immersions in codimension one, over a field of characteristic $2$ or $3$. We show that $d_2$ of an element is non-zero in characteristic $2$, which has already been proved by Salvatore essentially, and $d_3$ of another element is non-zero in characteristic $3$. While even convergence of the sequence is unclear in condimension one, these results have some applications to non-formality of operads. The result in characteristic $3$ implies planar non-formality of the standard map $C_*(E_1)\\to C_*(E_2)$ in characteristic $3$, where $C_*(E_k)$ denotes the chain little $k$-disks operad. We also reprove the result of Salvatore which states $C_*(E_2)$ is not formal as a planar operad in characteristic $2$. For computation, we use a duality between configuration spaces and fat diagonals.",

Dear Prof. Canay, dear Prof. Inoue,

I am pleased to submit our paper entitled \emph{``High-Frequency Volatility Estimation with Fast Multiple Change Points Detection''} by El Mehdi Ainasse, Greeshma Balabhadra and Pawe\l\ Polak for consideration for publication in the Journal of Business \& Economic Statistics. 




This manuscript has not been published and is not under consideration for publication elsewhere. If you feel that the manuscript is appropriate for your journal, we suggest the following Associate Editors to handle the review process:  
\begin{itemize}
    \item Markus Pelger, (Stanford University , \url{mpelger@stanford.edu}) an expert on machine learning, factor modeling, and asset pricing.
\item Dacheng Xiu, (University of Chicago, \url{dacheng.xiu@chicagobooth.edu}) an expert on financial econometrics, asset pricing and machine learning. We use similar collection of models and factors as in his recent paper.
\item Shipra Agrawal, (Columbia University, \url{sa3305@columbia.edu}) she is an expert on online optimization and online learning algorithms.
\end{itemize}
\newpage 
Potential reviewers include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ali Hirsa (Columbia University, \url{ali.hirsa@columbia.edu}) expert on financial econometrics. We cite his paper on sector rotation using machine learning.
    \item Gianluca De Nard (New York University and University of Zurich, \url{gianluca.denard@econ.uzh.ch}) an expert on factor modeling, asset pricing, and portfolio optimization. He is the corresponding author of the paper on model averaging for asset pricing that we cite in the introduction.
    \item Gavin Brown (University of Manchester, \url{gavin.brown@manchester.ac.uk}) expert on ensemble learning, we cite his recent work on ``A Unified Theory of Diversity in Ensemble Learning.''
\end{itemize}

Thank you for your consideration.

\closing{Yours sincerely,\\ \ \\ Pawe\l\  Polak}

ABSTRACT = {Constant-specified and exponential concentration inequalities play an essential role in the finite-sample theory of machine learning and high-dimensional statistics area. We obtain sharper and constants-specified concentration inequalities for the sum of independent sub-Weibull random variables, which leads to a mixture of two tails: sub-Gaussian for small deviations and sub-Weibull for large deviations from the mean. These bounds are new and improve existing bounds with sharper constants. In addition, a new sub-Weibull parameter is also proposed, which enables recovering the tight concentration inequality for a random variable (vector). For statistical applications, we give an &#8467;2-error of estimated coefficients in negative binomial regressions when the heavy-tailed covariates are sub-Weibull distributed with sparse structures, which is a new result for negative binomial regressions. In applying random matrices, we derive non-asymptotic versions of Bai-Yin&rsquo;s theorem for sub-Weibull entries with exponential tail bounds. Finally, by demonstrating a sub-Weibull confidence region for a log-truncated Z-estimator without the second-moment condition, we discuss and define the sub-Weibull type robust estimator for independent observations {Xi}i=1n without exponential-moment conditions.},

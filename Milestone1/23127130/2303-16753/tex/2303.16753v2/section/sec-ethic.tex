The use of a large corpus for training large language models may raise ethical concerns, particularly regarding the potential for bias in the data. In our study, we take precautions to minimize this issue by utilizing only standard training data sources, such as BOOKCORPUS and Wikipedia, which are widely used in language model training~\cite{devlin2018bert,lan2019albert}. However, it is important to note that when applying our method to other datasets, the potential bias must be carefully considered and addressed. Further investigation and attention should be given to this issue in future studies.

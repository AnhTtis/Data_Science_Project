We predict a first order phase transition from normal to superfluid at ${x}_{c}=0.44$ corresponding, in the presence of harmonic trapping, to a critical polarization ${P}_{c}=({N}_{\ensuremath{\uparrow}}\ensuremath{-}{N}_{\ensuremath{\downarrow}})/({N}_{\ensuremath{\uparrow}}+{N}_{\ensuremath{\downarrow}})=77%$. We calculate the radii and the density profiles in the trap and predict that the frequency of the spin dipole mode will be increased by a factor of 1.23 due to interactions.},

abstract = {We develop a Monte Carlo scheme for sampling series of Feynman diagrams for the proper self-energy, which are self-consistently expressed in terms of renormalized particle propagators. This approach is used to solve the problem of a single spin-down fermion resonantly interacting with the Fermi gas of spin-up particles. Though the original series based on bare propagators are sign alternating and divergent, one can still determine the answer behind them by using two strategies (separately or together): (i) using proper series resummation techniques and (ii) introducing renormalized propagators which are defined in terms of the simulated proper self-energy, i.e., making the entire scheme self-consistent. Our solution is important for understanding the phase diagram and properties of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer--Bose-Einstein Condensation crossover in the strongly imbalanced regime. On the technical side, we develop a generic sign-problem tolerant method for exact numerical solution of polaron-type models and, possibly, of the interacting many-body Hamiltonians.},

The variational method applied to this gives an energy for all values of the coupling constant. It is at least as accurate as previously known results. The effective mass of the electron is also calculated, but the accuracy here is difficult to judge.},

abstract = {The parameters for the Feynman model of a polaron are evaluated numerically for various values of the electron lattice interaction $\ensuremath{\alpha}$, in the usual idealization of the problem of a slow electron in a polar crystal. The self-energy and effective mass thus obtained are compared with earlier polaron theories, indicating the superiority of the Feynman model for a wide range of $\ensuremath{\alpha}$. The polaron size and the effect of the continuum approximation are estimated, and it is concluded that the alkali halides, at least, may be in the border region for the validity of this approximation. The problem of calculating polaron mobility as determined by scattering with longitudinal optical mode phonons is analyzed and previous theories are critically reviewed. A new theory based on the Feynman model is developed in which the Boltzmann equation is used with resonance scattering considered as the fundamental scattering process. A comparison with previous theories shows some improvements and stresses still doubtful points. A comparison with various experiments suggests the possible inadequacy of the usual idealization.},

abstract = {Ewald summation is an important technique used to deal with long-range Coulomb interaction. While it is widely used in simulations of molecules and solid state materials, many important results are dispersed in literature and their implementations are often buried deep in large software packages. Since reliable and systematic calculation of Coulomb interaction is critical for the investigation of perovskites, here we start from the fundamentals of Ewald summation and derive clear expressions for long-range charge-charge, dipole-dipole, and charge-dipole interactions, which can be readily used for numerical computations. We also provide the interaction matrix for efficient Monte Carlo simulations involving charges and dipoles, implementing them in a Python software package. A new type of interaction matrix, which accounts for the electrostatic energy change when ions are displaced, is also derived and implemented. These results are the foundations for the investigation of ferroelectric perovskites.}

@article{Winding,
	Abstract = {The normal and superfluid densities are defined by the response of a liquid to sample boundary motion. The free-energy change due to uniform boundary motion can be calculated by path-integral methods from the distribution of the winding number of the paths around a periodic cell. This provides a conceptually and computationally simple way of calculating the superfluid density for any Bose system. The linear-response formulation relates the superfluid density to the momentum-density correlation function, which has a short-ranged part related to the normal density and, in the case of a superfluid, a long-ranged part whose strength is proportional to the superfluid density. These facts are discussed in the context of path-integral computations and demonstrated for liquid $^{4}\mathrm{He}$ along the saturated vapor-pressure curve. Below the experimental superfluid transition temperature the computed superfluid fractions agree with the experimental values to within the statistical uncertainties of a few percent in the computations. The computed transition is broadened by finite-sample-size effects.},

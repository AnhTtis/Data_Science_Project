    "abstract": "We use a newly developed Quantum Monte Carlo method based on the path-integral formulation of the particle sector and the real-space diagrammatic technique of the phonon sector to investigate the impact of a finite dispersion of the optical phonon mode on the properties of the bond Su-Schrieffer-Heeger polaron in two dimensions. Our study focuses on the effect of positive bandwidth on the bond polaron's effective mass, ground state energy, and $Z$ factor, comparing these properties with those of the dispersionless case. At the same electron-phonon coupling strength, in the absence of phonon dispersion, we observe that the effective mass increases as the phonon frequency decreases, indicating a heavier polaron in the deep adiabatic regime. While in the dispersive case, we find that the effective mass increases as the phonon bandwidth increases. Furthermore, we observe a crossover from a light polaron state to a heavy polaron state in the deep adiabatic regime for both the dispersionless and dispersive case.",

    "abstract": "The objective of the work is to improve the capacity of the micro cell, i.e., enabling the micro cell base station of a two-tier network to serve an increased number of devices. Therefore, the work deployed an IRS in a micro cell and achieved significant improvements in the performance with a reduced transmit power of the micro base station.",

    "abstract": "This paper designs a distributed least square solution method for a linear\nalgebraic equation over a multiagent network. The coefficient matrix is divided\ninto multiple blocks, and each agent only knows a subset of these blocks. The\ndesigned method is discrete-time and based on a proximal ADMM algorithm. By\napplying the designed method, each agent can find its corresponding part in one\nleast square solution of the considered linear algebraic equation while using\nonly its information and communicating with its neighbors. Numerical\nsimulations verify the effectiveness of the designed method in MATLAB.",

    "abstract": "Exhaled droplet and aerosol-mediated transmission of respiratory diseases, including SARS-CoV-2, is exacerbated in poorly ventilated environments where body heat-driven airflow prevails. Employing large-scale simulations, we reveal how the human body heat can potentially spread pathogenic species between occupants in a room. Morphological phase transition in airflow takes place as the distance between human heat sources is varied which shapes novel patterns of disease transmission: For sufficiently large distance, individual buoyant plume creates a natural barrier, forming a ``thermal armour'' that blocks suspension spread between occupants. However, for small distances, collective effect emerges and thermal plumes condense into super-structure, facilitating long-distance suspension transport via crossing between convection rolls. Our quantitative analysis demonstrates that infection risk increases significantly at critical distances due to collective behavior and phase transition. This highlights the importance of maintaining reasonable social distancing indoors to minimize viral particle transmission and offers new insights into the critical behavior of pathogen spread.",

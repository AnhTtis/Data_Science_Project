abstract = {One of the most striking contemporary developments in the field of machine learning is the meteoric ascent of what has been called “deep learning,” and this area is now at the forefront of current research. We discuss key differences between traditional neural network architectures and learning techniques, and those that have become popular in deep learning. A detailed derivation of the backpropagation algorithm in vector-matrix form is provided, and the relationship to computational graphs and deep learning software is discussed. Deep convolutional neural networks are covered, as well as autoencoders, recurrent neural networks, and stochastic approaches based on Boltzmann machines. Key practical aspects of training these models with large data sets are discussed, along with the role of GPU computing.},

  abstract = 	 { We consider the problem of controlling a possibly unknown linear dynamical system with adversarial perturbations, adversarially chosen convex loss functions, and partially observed states, known as non-stochastic control. We  introduce a controller parametrization based on the denoised observations, and prove that applying online gradient descent to this parametrization yields a new controller which attains sublinear regret vs. a large class of closed-loop policies. In the fully-adversarial setting, our controller attains an optimal regret bound of $\sqrt{T}$-when the system is known, and, when combined with an initial stage of least-squares estimation, $T^{2/3}$ when the system is unknown;  both yield the first sublinear regret for the partially observed setting. Our bounds are the first in the non-stochastic control setting that compete with \emph{all} stabilizing linear dynamical controllers, not just state feedback. Moreover, in the presence of semi-adversarial noise containing both stochastic and adversarial components, our controller attains the optimal regret bounds of $\mathrm{poly}(\log T)$ when the system is known, and  $\sqrt{T}$ when unknown. To our knowledge, this gives the first end-to-end $\sqrt{T}$ regret for online Linear Quadratic Gaussian controller, and applies in a more general setting with adversarial losses and semi-adversarial noise.}

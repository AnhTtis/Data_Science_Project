    \caption{Detections (blue bounding box) from WSOD models trained with various vetting methods (top row) indicate that training with either VEIL filtering method leads to similar detection capability on VOC-07 \cite{Everingham2010ThePV}, and show a strong part and contextual bias in Large Loss and No Vetting. The categories shown by row (from top to bottom) are: car, car, boat, bicycle, bird, chair.}

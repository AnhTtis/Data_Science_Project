    "abstract": "Motivated by the recently observed $D_{s0}(2590)$ state by LHCb, we investigate the mass spectrum and the strong decay properties of the charmed-strange mesons within Godfrey-Isgur model considering the coupled-channel effects. Our results support that $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$ can be interpreted as the $D_{s}(1^3P_0)$ and $D_{s}(1^3P_1)$ states with larger $DK$ and $D^*K$ components, respectively, and $D_{s1}(2700)$, $D_{s1}(2536)$, $D^*_{s2}(2573)$, $D_{s1}^*(2860)$, $D_{s3}^*(2860)$, and $D_{sJ}^*(3040)$ can be well interpreted as the $D_s(2^3S_1)$, $D_s(1^1P_1)$, $D_s(1^3P_2)$, $D_s(1^3D_1)$, $D_s(1^3D_3)$, and $D_s(2^1P_1)$ states, respectively. Although, $D_{s0}(2590)$ mass is about 50 MeV less than our prediction for the $D_{s}(2^1S_0)$ state, its width is still in good agreement with the one of $D_{s}(2^1S_0)$. Therefore, $D_{s0}(2590)$ state needs to be further confirmed by the experimental measurements, and the more precise information about $D_{s0}(2590)$ will shed light on its assignment of $D_{s}(2^1S_0)$. Furthermore, we predict the masses and the strong decay properties of the charmed-strange mesons with masses around 3 GeV, which would be helpful to experimentally search for these states.",

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we present DiffusionAD, a novel anomaly detection pipeline consisting of a reconstruction sub-network and a segmentation sub-network. Firstly, we redefine the reconstruction process using a diffusion model, adopting the noise-to-norm paradigm where anomalous regions are perturbed by Gaussian noise and then reconstructed to appear normal. 
Secondly, we present a one-step denoising paradigm, which is significantly faster than the iterative denoising approach in diffusion models. 
In addition, we propose the norm-guided paradigm to further enhance the reconstruction quality. 
Finally, the segmentation sub-network exploits the inconsistencies and commonalities between the input image and its anomaly-free restoration to predict pixel-level anomaly scores. Extensive evaluations across four datasets demonstrate that DiffusionAD outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the effectiveness and wide applicability of this novel pipeline.

    "abstract": "Achieving high bit rates is the main goal of wireless technologies like 5G and beyond. This translates to obtaining high spectral efficiencies using large number of antennas at the transmitter and receiver (single user massive multiple input multiple output or SU-MMIMO). It is possible to have a large number of antennas in the mobile handset at mm-wave frequencies in the range $30 - 300$ GHz due to the small antenna size. In this work, we investigate the bit-error-rate (BER) performance of SU-MMIMO in two scenarios (a) using serially concatenated turbo code (SCTC) in uncorrelated channel and (b) parallel concatenated turbo code (PCTC) in correlated channel. Computer simulation results indicate that the BER is quite insensitive to re-transmissions and wide variations in the number of transmit and receive antennas. Moreover, we have obtained a BER of $10^{-5}$ at an average signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) per bit of just 1.25 dB with 512 transmit and receive antennas ($512\\times 512$ SU-MMIMO system) with a spectral efficiency of 256 bits/transmission or 256 bits/sec/Hz in an uncorrelated channel. Similar BER results have been obtained for SU-MMIMO using PCTC in correlated channel. A semi-analytic approach to estimating the BER of a turbo code has been derived.",

The contributions of this paper are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A theory of \ac{MV}-solutions to \acp{DDE} with multiple histories (in $\hs$) and free terminal time
    \item A measure \ac{LP} that upper-bounds problem \eqref{eq:peak_delay_traj}
    \item A convergent sequence of \acp{LMI} (and resultant \acp{SDP}) to the measure upper-bound
    \item A proof of strong duality for the measure \ac{LP}
\end{itemize}

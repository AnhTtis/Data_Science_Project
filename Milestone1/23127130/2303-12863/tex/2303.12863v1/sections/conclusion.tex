This paper presented a formulation of 
\ac{MV}-solutions for free-terminal-time \acp{DDE} with multiple histories (Definition \ref{defn:mv_solution}). These \ac{MV}-solutions are formed by the conjunction of Validity, Liouville and Consistency constraints.
These \ac{MV}-solutions may be used to provide upper bounds on peak estimation problems over \acp{DDE} by Program \eqref{eq:peak_delay_meas}.

% constructed from measures may be used to characterize the behavior of \ac{DDE} trajectories.  Peak Estimation problems for \acp{DDE} may be upper bounded by optimizing over a set of free-terminal time \ac{MV}-solutions.
% \ac{MV}-solutions of a \ac{DDE} given a single history $x_h$ are unique for fixed and free terminal time problems (where a distribution of stopping times are given for the free-time case). These \ac{MV}-solutions may be used to bound trajectory analysis problems such as peak estimation and reachable set estimation.
% \ac{MV}-solutions of \acp{DDE} will be used in subsequent chapters to formulate optimal control, peak estimation, and reachable set estimation problems. 
% One vital area for future work is determining under what conditions does it occur that each weak solution is supported on the graph of \ac{DDE} trajectories \cite{ambrosio2003lecture}. Such a statement would impose that there is no relaxation gap between the trajectory and measure programs, and therefore that the sequence of \ac{LMI} solutions will converge to the true optimum as the degree $d \rightarrow \infty$. 

A vital area for future work is determining the conditions under which $P^* = p^*$ between \eqref{eq:peak_delay_traj} and \eqref{eq:peak_delay_meas}.
Other areas for future work include applying \ac{MV}-solutions to other  problems (such as optimal control and reachable set estimation), analyzing systems with multiple time-delays, improving approximation quality by spatio-temporal partitioning \cite{Cibulka2021SpatioTemporalDO}, developing \ac{MV}-solutions for discrete-time systems with large time delays, handling graph-constrained history classes $\hs$ that have additional requirements (e.g., constant $x_h$ in time), and formulating \ac{MV}-solutions for \acp{DDE} with other types of time delays (e.g., proportional, distributed, unknown-but-bounded).

% Trajectory analysis problems with dynamic uncertainty may be phrased as optimal control problems, and bounding optimal control costs in time delay systems using occupation measures will be the subject of a sequel work.
% Uncertainties in delays (including time-evolving delays) will also be further examined.

This paper presented a formulation of 
\ac{MV}-solutions for free-terminal-time \acp{DDE} with multiple histories (Definition \ref{defn:mv_solution}). These \ac{MV}-solutions are formed by the conjunction of Validity, Liouville and Consistency constraints.
These \ac{MV}-solutions may be used to provide upper bounds on peak estimation problems over \acp{DDE} by Program \eqref{eq:peak_delay_meas}.

A vital area for future work is determining the conditions under which $P^* = p^*$ between \eqref{eq:peak_delay_traj} and \eqref{eq:peak_delay_meas} (Conjecture \ref{conj:delay}).
Other areas for future work include applying \ac{MV}-solutions to other  problems (such as reachable set and positive-invariant set estimation) and formulating delay-dependent \ac{MV}-solutions.

   abstract = { This manuscript discusses discretization of the Vlasov--Poisson system in 2D+2V phase space using high-order accurate conservative finite difference algorithms. One challenge confronting direct kinetic simulation is the significant computational cost associated with the high-dimensional phase space description. In the present work we advocate the use of high-order accurate schemes as a mechanism to reduce the computational cost required to deliver a given level of error in the computed solution. We pursue a discretely conservative finite difference formulation of the governing equations, and discuss fourth- and sixth-order accurate schemes. In addition, we employ a minimally dissipative nonlinear scheme based on the well-known WENO (weighted essentially nonoscillatory) approach. Verification of the full formulation is performed using the method of manufactured solutions. Results are also presented for the physically relevant scenarios of Landau damping, and growth of transverse instabilities from an imposed plane wave. }

This review covers basic physics ingredients of the runaway phenomenon and the ongoing efforts (experimental and theoretical) aimed at runaway electron (RE) taming in the next generation tokamaks. We emphasize the prevailing physics themes of the last 20 years: the hot-tail mechanism of runaway production, RE interaction with impurity ions, the role of synchrotron radiation in runaway kinetics, RE transport in presence of magnetic fluctuations, micro-instabilities driven by REs in magnetized plasmas, and vertical stability of the plasma with REs.

These particle solutions solve a large coupled ODE system that retains all the important properties of the Landau operator, namely the conservation of mass, momentum and energy, and the decay of entropy. We illustrate our new method by showing its performance in several test cases including the physically relevant case of the Coulomb interaction. The comparison to the exact solution and the spectral method is strikingly good maintaining 2nd order accuracy. Moreover, an efficient implementation of the method via the treecode is explored. This gives a proof of concept for the practical use of our method when coupled with the classical PIC method for the Vlasov equation.},

   abstract = {This paper discusses a novel fully implicit formulation for a one-dimensional electrostatic particle-in-cell (PIC) plasma simulation approach. Unlike earlier implicit electrostatic PIC approaches (which are based on a linearized Vlasov–Poisson formulation), ours is based on a nonlinearly converged Vlasov–Ampére (VA) model. By iterating particles and fields to a tight nonlinear convergence tolerance, the approach features superior stability and accuracy properties, avoiding most of the accuracy pitfalls in earlier implicit PIC implementations. In particular, the formulation is stable against temporal (Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy) and spatial (aliasing) instabilities. It is charge- and energy-conserving to numerical round-off for arbitrary implicit time steps (unlike the earlier “energy-conserving” explicit PIC formulation, which only conserves energy in the limit of arbitrarily small time steps). While momentum is not exactly conserved, errors are kept small by an adaptive particle sub-stepping orbit integrator, which is instrumental to prevent particle tunneling (a deleterious effect for long-term accuracy). The VA model is orbit-averaged along particle orbits to enforce an energy conservation theorem with particle sub-stepping. As a result, very large time steps, constrained only by the dynamical time scale of interest, are possible without accuracy loss. Algorithmically, the approach features a Jacobian-free Newton–Krylov solver. A main development in this study is the nonlinear elimination of the new-time particle variables (positions and velocities). Such nonlinear elimination, which we term particle enslavement, results in a nonlinear formulation with memory requirements comparable to those of a fluid computation, and affords us substantial freedom in regards to the particle orbit integrator. Numerical examples are presented that demonstrate the advertised properties of the scheme. In particular, long-time ion acoustic wave simulations show that numerical accuracy does not degrade even with very large implicit time steps, and that significant CPU gains are possible.},

It treats the convective terms in the x and v directions separately and produces a scheme of second order in Δt. The resulting free-streaming and accelerating equations are computed with Fourier interpolation and spline interpolation methods respectively. The numerical method is tested with linear and nonlinear problems. The method is very accurate and efficient. A new method of smoothing the distribution function is given. It reduces the computational effort by artificially increasing the entropy of the system. As a result, the distribution function is smooth enough to be well represented on a given mesh. The methods can be generalized in a straightforward way to deal with more complicated cases such as problems with nonperiodic spatial boundary conditions, two- and three-dimensional problems with and without external magnetic and/or electric fields.}

For the global version of the code, the collision operator has been developed to allow for block-structured velocity space grids, allowing for computationally tractable collisional global simulations.

   abstract = {Upon application of a sufficiently strong electric field, electrons break away from thermal equilibrium and approach relativistic speeds. These highly energetic ‘runaway’ electrons (∼ MeV) play a significant role in tokamak disruption physics, and therefore their accurate understanding is essential to develop reliable mitigation strategies. For this purpose, we have developed a fully implicit solver for the 0D-2P (i.e., including two momenta coordinates) relativistic nonlinear Fokker–Planck equation (rFP). As in earlier implicit rFP studies (NORSE, CQL3D), electron–ion interactions are modeled using the Lorentz operator, and synchrotron damping using the Abraham–Lorentz–Dirac reaction term. However, our implementation improves on these earlier studies by (1) ensuring exact conservation properties for electron collisions, (2) strictly preserving positivity, and (3) being scalable algorithmically and in parallel. Key to our proposed approach is an efficient multigrid preconditioner for the linearized rFP equation, a multigrid elliptic solver for the Braams–Karney potentials (Braams and Karney, 1987), and a novel adaptive technique to determine the associated boundary values. We verify the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed scheme with numerical results ranging from small electric-field electrical conductivity measurements to the accurate reproduction of runaway tail dynamics when strong electric fields are applied.},

   abstract = {Common time-explicit numerical methods for kinetic simulations of plasmas in the low-collisions limit fall into two classes of algorithms: momentum conserving (also known as particle-in-cell (PIC)) and energy conserving. Each has certain drawbacks. The PIC algorithm does not conserve total energy, which may lead to spurious numerical heating (grid heating). Its overall accuracy is at most second due to the nature of the force interpolation between grid and particle position. Energy-conserving algorithms do not exhibit grid heating, but because their formulation uses potentials, computationally undesirable matrix inversions may be necessary. In addition, compared to PIC algorithms for the same accuracy, these algorithms have higher numerical noise due to the restricted choice of particle shapes. Here we formulate time-explicit, finite-size particle algorithms using particular reductions of the particle distribution function. These reductions are used in two variational principles, a Lagrangian-based and a Hamiltonian-based in conjunction with a non-canonical Poisson bracket. The Lagrangian formulations here generalize previous such formulations. The Hamiltonian formulation is presented here for the first time. Many drawbacks of the two classes of particle methods are mitigated. For example, restrictions on particle shapes are relaxed in energy conserving algorithms, which can decrease the numerical noise in these methods. The Hamiltonian formulation of particle algorithms is done in terms of fields instead of potentials, thus avoiding solving Poisson's equation. An algorithm that conserves both energy and momentum is presented. Other features of the algorithms include a natural way to perform coordinate transformations, the use of various time integrating methods, and the ability to increase the overall accuracy beyond second order, including all generalizations. For clarity of presentation, we restrict our discussion to one-dimensional, non-relativistic, unmagnetized, electrostatic plasmas. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

In this approach the distribution function is represented over a computational mesh. Time integration is done by advancing the distribution in real phase space as in finite difference methods. However, the derivatives with respect to all the phase-space variables are computed by finite Fourier transform methods. Truncation errors are principally due to time discretization, and are controlled by the choice of the time step. As for the phase-space variables, the accuracy of the computation is determined by the harmonic content of the distribution function, since contributions due to coupling between Fourier modes are computed with high accuracy. The numerical method has been tested on linear and nonlinear problems, and our results agree remarkably well with those obtained from the Fourier-Hermite method. However, for comparable overall accuracy, the present method is about ten times more efficient (CPU time) than the Fourier-Hermite method in some of the examples discussed in this paper.}

In this article, the non-linear single-species Fokker-Planck-Landau collision operator developed by Yoon and Chang (2014) [9] is generalized to include multiple particle species. The finite volume discretization used in this work naturally yields exact conservation of mass, momentum, and energy. The implementation of this new non-linear Fokker-Planck-Landau operator in the gyrokinetic particle-in-cell codes XGC1 and XGCa is described and results of a verification study are discussed. Finally, the numerical techniques that make our non-linear collision operator viable on high-performance computing systems are described, including specialized load balancing algorithms and nested OpenMP parallelization. The collision operator's good weak and strong scaling behavior are shown.},

   abstract = {In purely non-dissipative systems, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian reduction have been proven to be powerful tools for deriving physical models with exact conservation laws. We have discovered a hint that an analogous reduction method exists also for dissipative systems that respect the first and second laws of thermodynamics. In this paper, we show that modern electrostatic gyrokinetics, a reduced plasma turbulence model, exhibits a serendipitous metriplectic structure. Metriplectic dynamics, in general, is a well developed formalism for extending the concept of Poisson brackets to dissipative systems. Better yet, our discovery enables an intuitive particle-in-cell discretization of the collision operator that also satisfies the first and second laws of thermodynamics. These results suggest that collisional gyrokinetics, and other dissipative physical models that obey the laws of thermodynamics, could be obtained using an as-yet undiscovered metriplectic reduction theory and that numerical methods could benefit from such theory significantly. Once uncovered, the theory would generalize Lagrangian and Hamiltonian reduction in a substantial manner.},

A discussion is offered of dispersion equations, conditions necessary for the growth or decay of oscillations, the physical mechanisms of growing or damping, and the possibility of arbitrary steady-state solutions. The physical situation is described in terms of Poisson's equation and the Boltzmann equation, while the mathematical description is in terms of solutions of an initial-value problem in the small amplitude (linearized) approximation. Some general results are derived for an arbitrary unperturbed velocity distribution of electrons and ions. From these expressions the customary results for a stationary plasma in thermal equilibrium can readily be obtained. For simplicity, one dimensional motion of a simple one component plasma is treated in detail; appropriate generalizations for two or more component plasmas (electrons and ions) are, however, indicated in text. Collisions between particles and non-linear effects are not considered, nor are the effects of external electric or magnetic fields.}

   abstract = {Numerical heating in particle-in-cell (PIC) codes currently precludes the accurate simulation of cold, relativistic plasma over long periods, severely limiting their applications in astrophysical environments. We present a spatially higher-order accurate relativistic PIC algorithm in one spatial dimension, which conserves charge and momentum exactly. We utilize the smoothness implied by the usage of higher-order interpolation functions to achieve a spatially higher-order accurate algorithm (up to the fifth order). We validate our algorithm against several test problems—thermal stability of stationary plasma, stability of linear plasma waves, and two-stream instability in the relativistic and non-relativistic regimes. Comparing our simulations to exact solutions of the dispersion relations, we demonstrate that SHARP can quantitatively reproduce important kinetic features of the linear regime. Our simulations have a superior ability to control energy non-conservation and avoid numerical heating in comparison to common second-order schemes. We provide a natural definition for convergence of a general PIC algorithm: the complement of physical modes captured by the simulation, i.e., those that lie above the Poisson noise, must grow commensurately with the resolution. This implies that it is necessary to simultaneously increase the number of particles per cell and decrease the cell size. We demonstrate that traditional ways for testing for convergence fail, leading to plateauing of the energy error. This new PIC code enables us to faithfully study the long-term evolution of plasma problems that require absolute control of the energy and momentum conservation.}

Extending earlier work, discretization of the electromagnetic Low Lagrangian is performed via a reduction of the phase-space distribution function onto a collection of finite-sized macroparticles of arbitrary shape and discretization of field quantities onto a spatial grid. This approach may be used with lab frame coordinates or moving window coordinates; the latter can greatly improve computational efficiency for studying some types of laser-plasma interactions. The primary advantage of the variational approach is the preservation of Lagrangian symmetries, which in our case leads to energy conservation and thus avoids difficulties with grid heating. In addition, this approach decouples particle size from grid spacing and relaxes restrictions on particle shape, leading to low numerical noise. The variational approach also guarantees consistent approximations in the equations of motion and is amenable to higher order methods in both space and time.

Unlike most earlier studies, we base our development on the Rosenbluth (rather than Landau) form of the Fokker-Planck collision operator, which reduces complexity while allowing for an optimal fully implicit treatment. Our discrete conservation strategy employs nonlinear constraints that force the continuum symmetries of the collision operator to be satisfied upon discretization. We converge the resulting nonlinear system iteratively using Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov methods, effectively preconditioned with multigrid methods for efficiency. Single- and multi-species numerical examples demonstrate the advertised accuracy properties of the scheme, and the superior algorithmic performance of our approach. In particular, the discretization approach is numerically shown to be second-order accurate in time and velocity space and to exhibit manifestly positive entropy production. That is, H-theorem behavior is indicated for all the examples we have tested. The solution approach is demonstrated to scale optimally with respect to grid refinement (with CPU time growing linearly with the number of mesh points), and timestep (showing very weak dependence of CPU time with time-step size).

   Existing theories of stationary plasma oscillations lead to a dispersion equation (2), involving an integration across a pole. It is here shown that this difficulty is of purely mathematical origin, and can be overcome by a proper treatment. This treatment leads to a complete set of stationary solutions, which are much more numerous than the usual plasma oscillations. In particular, their wave lengths and frequencies are not connected by a dispersion equation, but independently assume all real values. Special superpositions of these stationary solutions correspond to the usual plasma oscillations. They constitute slightly damped plane waves, which do obey the dispersion equation (2), the integral being interpreted as a Cauchy principal value. An arbitrary initial distribution behaves (after a short transient time) like a superposition of such waves, as far as the density is concerned.}

   abstract = {Recent development of structure-preserving geometric particle-in-cell (PIC) algorithms for Vlasov-Maxwell systems is summarized. With the arrival of 100 petaflop and exaflop computing power, it is now possible to carry out direct simulations of multi-scale plasma dynamics based on first-principles. However, standard algorithms currently adopted by the plasma physics community do not possess the long-term accuracy and fidelity required for these large-scale simulations. This is because conventional simulation algorithms are based on numerically solving the underpinning differential (or integro-differential) equations, and the algorithms used in general do not preserve the geometric and physical structures of the systems, such as the local energy-momentum conservation law, the symplectic structure, and the gauge symmetry. As a consequence, numerical errors accumulate coherently with time and long-term simulation results are not reliable. To overcome this difficulty and to harness the power of exascale computers, a new generation of structure-preserving geometric PIC algorithms have been developed. This new generation of algorithms utilizes modern mathematical techniques, such as discrete manifolds, interpolating differential forms, and non-canonical symplectic integrators, to ensure gauge symmetry, space-time symmetry and the conservation of charge, energy-momentum, and the symplectic structure. These highly desired properties are difficult to achieve using the conventional PIC algorithms. In addition to summarizing the recent development and demonstrating practical implementations, several new results are also presented, including a structure-preserving geometric relativistic PIC algorithm, the proof of the correspondence between discrete gauge symmetry and discrete charge conservation law, and a reformulation of the explicit non-canonical symplectic algorithm for the discrete Poisson bracket using the variational approach. Numerical examples are given to verify the advantages of the structure-preserving geometric PIC algorithms in comparison with the conventional PIC methods.},

   abstract = {Explicit high-order non-canonical symplectic particle-in-cell algorithms for classical particle-field systems governed by the Vlasov-Maxwell equations are developed. The algorithms conserve a discrete non-canonical symplectic structure derived from the Lagrangian of the particle-field system, which is naturally discrete in particles. The electromagnetic field is spatially discretized using the method of discrete exterior calculus with high-order interpolating differential forms for a cubic grid. The resulting time-domain Lagrangian assumes a non-canonical symplectic structure. It is also gauge invariant and conserves charge. The system is then solved using a structure-preserving splitting method discovered by He et al. [preprint arXiv:1505.06076 (2015)], which produces five exactly soluble sub-systems, and high-order structure-preserving algorithms follow by combinations. The explicit, high-order, and conservative nature of the algorithms is especially suitable for long-term simulations of particle-field systems with extremely large number of degrees of freedom on massively parallel supercomputers. The algorithms have been tested and verified by the two physics problems, i.e., the nonlinear Landau damping and the electron Bernstein wave.},

   abstract = {Explicit structure-preserving geometric particle-in-cell (PIC) algorithm in curvilinear orthogonal coordinate systems is developed. The work reported represents a further development of the structure-preserving geometric PIC algorithm achieving the goal of practical applications in magnetic fusion research. The algorithm is constructed by discretizing the field theory for the system of charged particles and electromagnetic field using Whitney forms, discrete exterior calculus, and explicit non-canonical symplectic integration. In addition to the truncated infinitely dimensional symplectic structure, the algorithm preserves exactly many important physical symmetries and conservation laws, such as local energy conservation, gauge symmetry and the corresponding local charge conservation. As a result, the algorithm possesses the long-term accuracy and fidelity required for first-principles-based simulations of the multiscale tokamak physics. The algorithm has been implemented in the SymPIC code, which is designed for high-efficiency massively-parallel PIC simulations in modern clusters. The code has been applied to carry out whole-device 6D kinetic simulation studies of tokamak physics. A self-consistent kinetic steady state for fusion plasma in the tokamak geometry is numerically found with a predominately diagonal and anisotropic pressure tensor. The state also admits a steady-state sub-sonic ion flow in the range of 10 km s-1, agreeing with experimental observations and analytical calculations Kinetic ballooning instability in the self-consistent kinetic steady state is simulated. It is shown that high-n ballooning modes have larger growth rates than low-n global modes, and in the nonlinear phase the modes saturate approximately in 5 ion transit times at the 2% level by the E × B flow generated by the instability. These results are consistent with early and recent electromagnetic gyrokinetic simulations.},

   abstract = {An explicit high-order noncanonical symplectic algorithm for ideal two-fluid systems is developed. The fluid is discretized as particles in the Lagrangian description, while the electromagnetic fields and internal energy are treated as discrete differential form fields on a fixed mesh. With the assistance of Whitney interpolating forms [H. Whitney, Geometric Integration Theory (Princeton University Press, 1957); M. Desbrun et al., Discrete Differential Geometry (Springer, 2008); J. Xiao et al., Phys. Plasmas 22, 112504 (2015)], this scheme preserves the gauge symmetry of the electromagnetic field, and the pressure field is naturally derived from the discrete internal energy. The whole system is solved using the Hamiltonian splitting method discovered by He et al. [Phys. Plasmas 22, 124503 (2015)], which was been successfully adopted in constructing symplectic particle-in-cell schemes [J. Xiao et al., Phys. Plasmas 22, 112504 (2015)]. Because of its structure preserving and explicit nature, this algorithm is especially suitable for large-scale simulations for physics problems that are multi-scale and require long-term fidelity and accuracy. The algorithm is verified via two tests: studies of the dispersion relation of waves in a two-fluid plasma system and the oscillating two-stream instability.},

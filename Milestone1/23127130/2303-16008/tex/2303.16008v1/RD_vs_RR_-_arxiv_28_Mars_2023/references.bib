abstract = {purpose: To determine whether alternative methods of presenting a contrast between the same two quantities in descriptions of research results could lead to different treatment decisions by physicians. subjects and methods: We conducted a survey of practicing physicians and of faculty and fellows in training programs in clinical epidemiology and social science research methods. Each questionnaire presented results from a published study of either hypertension or hypercholesterolemia in two different ways: once as the relative change in the outcome rate and once as the absolute change in the outcome rate. We asked respondents to read each summary and indicate how the information contained in the summary would influence decisions about treatment. results: Of the 235 physicians who completed the questionnaire, 108 (46\%) gave different responses to the same results presented in different ways. Of these, 97 (89.8\%) indicated a stronger inclination to treat patients after reading of the relative change in the outcome rate (p <0.0001). conclusion: The manner of presentation of results can influence physicians' judgments about the treatment of patients.}

This paper presents a geometric approach to assess the direction of the bias resulting from omitted covariates and develop intuition about the effects of omitted covariates. We show that the direction of the bias depends simply on geometric properties of the link function. We present an expression for the magnitude of the bias and the results of simulations which corroborate these findings. We also consider an extension of the methods to assess the effects of omitted covariates which are correlated with those included.}",

abstract = {Background and Objectives
In clinical trials, the relative risk or risk ratio (RR) is a mainstay of reporting of the effect magnitude for an intervention. The RR is the ratio of the probability of an outcome in an intervention group to its probability in a control group. Thus, the RR provides a measure of change in the likelihood of an event linked to a given intervention. This measure has been widely used because it is today considered a measure with “portability” across varying outcome prevalence, especially when the outcome is rare. It turns out, however, that there is a much more important problem with this ratio, and this paper aims to demonstrate this problem.
Methods
We used mathematical derivation to determine if the RR is a measure of effect magnitude alone (i.e., a larger absolute value always indicating a stronger effect) or not. We also used the same derivation to determine its relationship to the prevalence of an outcome. We confirm the derivation results with a follow-up analysis of 140,620 trials scraped from the Cochrane.
Results
We demonstrate that the RR varies for reasons other than the magnitude of the effect because it is a ratio of two posterior probabilities, both of which are dependent on baseline prevalence of an outcome. In addition, we demonstrate that the RR shifts toward its null value with increasing outcome prevalence. The shift toward the null happens regardless of the strength of the association between intervention and outcome. The odds ratio (OR), the other commonly used ratio, measures solely the effect magnitude and has no relationship to the prevalence of an outcome in a study nor does it overestimate the RR as is commonly thought.
Conclusions
The results demonstrate the need to (1) end the primary use of the RR in clinical trials and meta-analyses as its direct interpretation is not meaningful, (2) replace the RR by the OR, and (3) only use the postintervention risk recalculated from the OR for any expected level of baseline risk in absolute terms for purposes of interpretation such as the number needed to treat. These results will have far-reaching implications such as reducing misleading results from clinical trials and meta-analyses and ushering in a new era in the reporting of such trials or meta-analyses in practice.}

Directed acyclic graphs clarify the causal relationships necessary for a particular variable to serve as an effect modifier for the causal risk difference involving 2 other variables. The directed acyclic graph causal framework thereby gives rise to a 4-fold classification for effect modification: direct effect modification, indirect effect modification, effect modification by proxy and effect modification by a common cause. We briefly discuss the case of multiple effect modification relationships and multiple effect modifiers as well as measures of effect other than that of the causal risk difference.},

In case-referent studies confounding can arise in two ways. A priori confounders are correlates of exposure in the joint source population of cases and reference subjects; also, they are determinants of diagnosing the illness or have different selection implications between cases and referents. In addition, factors bearing on the accuracy of exposure information are confounders if distributed differently between cases and referents. Criteria based singularly on relationships in the data can be misleading. Similarly, a change in the estimate and even a change in the parameter as a result of control is not a criterion rooted in first principles of confounding and can lead to a false conclusion.}",

abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of screening for factor V Leiden mutation in women in the United States who use combination oral contraceptives. Design: Cost-effectiveness analysis. Setting: A national research reference laboratory, a university medical center, and an academic health center managed care organization. Patient(s): Women of reproductive age in the United States. Intervention(s): Baseline risk estimates of venous thromboembolic disease in the general population and in carriers of factor V Leiden mutation were calculated using available data. Main Outcome Measure(s): The number of women who would require factor V Leiden testing and the cost of identifying this cohort to prevent one death caused by venous thromboembolic disease before prescribing combination oral contraceptives. Result(s): To prevent one venous thromboembolic death attributable to the use of oral contraceptives in women with factor V Leiden mutation, >92,000 carriers would need to be identified and stopped from using these pills. The estimated charge to prevent this one death would exceed \$300 million. If the price of testing were discounted to 34.5\% of current charges, the cost still would be between \$105 million and \$130 million. Conclusion(s): Screening for factor V Leiden mutation before prescribing combination oral contraceptives is not a cost-effective use of U.S. health care dollars. The best and most cost-effective screening tool we have is taking a thorough personal and family history related to venous thromboembolic events.}

abstract = {We investigated whether the occurrence of venous thrombosis in young women who use oral contraceptives might be explained by the factor V Leiden mutation, which leads to resistance to activated protein C and enhances susceptibility to thrombosis. We compared 155 consecutive premenopausal women, aged 15 to 49, who had developed deep venous thrombosis in the absence of other underlying diseases, with 169 population controls. The risk of thrombosis among users of oral contraceptives was increased 4-fold (relative risk 3·8 [95\% Cl 2·4-6·0]). The risk of thrombosis among carriers of the mutation compared with non-carriers was increased 8-fold (7·9 [3·2-19·4]). Compared with women who did not use oral contraceptives and were not carriers of the mutation, the risk of thrombosis among those with both risk factors was increased more than 30-fold (34·7 [7·8-154]). Recalculation of population incidences from these relative risks shows that the absolute risk of venous thrombosis in young women who use oral contraceptives is much larger when they carry the factor V Leiden mutation. When a young woman develops thrombosis, her factor V Leiden status should be considered in counselling about her future method of contraception.}

title = "Issues in the selection of a summary statistic in meta-analysis of clinical trials with binary outcomes",
abstract = "Meta-analysis of binary data involves the computation of a weighted average of summary statistics calculated for each trial. The selection of the appropriate summary statistic is a subject of debate due to conflicts in the relative importance of mathematical properties and the ability to intuitively interpret results. This paper explores the process of identifying a summary statistic most likely to be consistent across trials when there is variation in control group event rates. Four summary statistics are considered: odds ratios (OR); risk differences (RD) and risk ratios of beneficial (RR(B)); and harmful outcomes (RR(H)). Each summary statistic corresponds to a different pattern of predicted absolute benefit of treatment with variation in baseline risk, the greatest difference in patterns of prediction being between RR(B) and RR(H). Selection of a summary statistic solely based on identification of the best-fitting model by comparing tests of heterogeneity is problematic, principally due to low numbers of trials. It is proposed that choice of a summary statistic should be guided by both empirical evidence and clinically informed debate as to which model is likely to be closest to the expected pattern of treatment benefit across baseline risks. Empirical investigations comparing the four summary statistics on a sample of 551 systematic reviews provide evidence that the RR and OR models are on average more consistent than RD, there being no difference on average between RR and OR. From a second sample of 114 meta-analyses evidence indicates that for interventions aimed at preventing an undesirable event, greatest absolute benefits are observed in trials with the highest baseline event rates, corresponding to the model of constant RR(H). The appropriate selection for a particular meta-analysis may depend on understanding reasons for variation in control group event rates; in some situations uncertainty about the choice of summary statistic will remain.",

	Abstract = {It is well known that the odds ratio is noncollapsible, in the sense that conditioning on a covariate that is related to the outcome typically changes the size of the odds ratio, even if this covariate is unrelated to the exposure. The risk difference and risk ratio do not have this peculiar property; we say that the risk difference and risk ratio are collapsible. However, noncollapsibility is not unique for the odds ratio; the rate difference and rate ratio are generally noncollapsible as well. This may seem paradoxical, since the rate can be viewed as a risk per unit time, and thus one would naively suspect that the rate difference/ratio should inherit collapsibility from the risk difference/ratio. Adding to the confusion, it was recently shown that the exposure coefficient in the Aalen additive hazards model is collapsible. This may seem to contradict the fact that the rate difference is generally noncollapsible, since the exposure coefficient in the Aalen additive hazards model is a rate difference. In this article, we use graphical arguments to explain why the rate difference/ratio does not inherit collapsibility from the risk difference/ratio. We also explain when and why the exposure coefficient in the Aalen additive hazards model is collapsible.},

    abstract = "{When a study outcome is rare in all strata used for an analysis, the odds ratio estimate of causal effects will approximate the risk ratio; therefore, odds ratios from most case-control studies can be interpreted as risk ratios. However, if a study outcome is common, the odds ratio will be further from 1 than the risk ratio. There is debate regarding the merits of risk ratios compared with odds ratios for the analysis of trials and cohort and cross-sectional studies with common outcomes. Odds ratios are conveniently symmetrical with regard to the outcome definition; the odds ratio for outcome Y is the inverse of the odds ratio for the outcome not Y. Risk ratios lack this symmetry, so it may be necessary to present 1 risk ratio for outcome Y and another for outcome not Y. Risk ratios, but not odds ratios, have a mathematical property called collapsibility; this means that the size of the risk ratio will not change if adjustment is made for a variable that is not a confounder. Because of collapsibility, the risk ratio, assuming no confounding, has a useful interpretation as the ratio change in average risk due to exposure among the exposed. Because odds ratios are not collapsible, they usually lack any interpretation either as the change in average odds or the average change in odds (the average odds ratio).Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med. 2009;163(5):438-445-->}",

    abstract = "{For the presentation of risk, both relative and absolute measures can be used. The relative risk is most often used, especially in studies showing the effects of a treatment. Relative risks have the appealing feature of summarizing two numbers (the risk in one group and the risk in the other) into one. However, this feature also represents their major weakness, that the underlying absolute risks are concealed and readers tend to overestimate the effect when it is presented in relative terms. In many situations, the absolute risk gives a better representation of the actual situation and also from the patient’s point of view absolute risks often give more relevant information. In this article, we explain the concepts of both relative and absolute risk measures. Using examples from nephrology literature we illustrate that unless ratio measures are reported with the underlying absolute risks, readers cannot judge the clinical relevance of the effect. We therefore recommend to report both the relative risk and the absolute risk with their 95\\% confidence intervals, as together they provide a complete picture of the effect and its implications.}",

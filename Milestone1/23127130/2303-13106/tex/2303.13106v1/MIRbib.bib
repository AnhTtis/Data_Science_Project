  abstract  = {Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States with over 3.5M annual cases. Presently, visual inspection by a dermatologist has good sensitivity (\&gt; 90\%) but poor specificity (\&lt; 10\%), especially for melanoma, which leads to a high number of unnecessary biopsies. Here we use dynamic thermal imaging (DTI) to demonstrate a rapid, accurate and non-invasive imaging system for detection of skin cancer. In DTI, the lesion is cooled down and the thermal recovery is recorded using infrared imaging. The thermal recovery curves of the suspected lesions are then utilized in the context of continuous-time detection theory in order to define an optimal statistical decision rule such that the sensitivity of the algorithm is guaranteed to be at a maximum for every prescribed false-alarm probability. The proposed methodology was tested in a pilot study including 140 human subjects demonstrating a sensitivity in excess of 99\% for a prescribed specificity in excess of 99\% for detection of skin cancer. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest reported accuracy for any non-invasive skin cancer diagnosis method.},

An adaptive brightness stretching method is first proposed for enhancing the visible image. Then, a hybrid multi-scale decomposition with edge-preserving filtering is proposed to decompose the source images. Finally, the fused result is obtained via a combination of the decomposed images in three different rules. Experimental results demonstrate that the FNCE method has better performance on the details (edges), the contrast, the sharpness, and the human visual perception. Therefore, better results for the night-vision context enhancement can be achieved.},

  abstract  = {We investigate the performance of the super-resolving quantum lidar with the entangled coherent states of light in the presence of loss and noise, especially in the noisy case. An exact analytical expression of the output signal has been derived with the binary-outcome photon counting measurements. Numerical results show that the resolution of our scheme with parity detection is \&\#x221A;N (N) times enhanced relative to that of the coherent-state strategy with the same (intensity) detection in the lossless and noiseless cases. The influences of phase diffusion on resolution and sensitivity have been analyzed and discussed. It is found that the super-resolution emerges in the whole diffusion rate regions, whereas the super-sensitivity just exists in the high and low diffusion rate regimes. Comparisons are made with the well known N00N states, the results show that the entangled coherent states performs better resolution and sensitivity than those of the N00N scheme in the whole diffusion regimes. In addition, the effects of photon loss on resolution and sensitivity have also been studied. The phase sensitivity can beat the shot noise limit and the resolution is much better than the Rayleigh diffraction limit in the whole loss regions. Finally, the zero-nonzero photon counting measurement gives much worse sensitivity than that of the parity detection, which is just opposite from the case as demonstrated in a recent coherent-light Mach-Zehnder experiment.},

We identify phase-matching conditions and single out regimes in which group-velocity matching can be achieved with commercially available pump lasers. Finally, we discuss how mid-IR single photons can be detected. Using our numerical results, we identify materials and pump lasers for upconversion detection in conventional wavelength bands. Our study provides a complete recipe for mid-IR single-photon generation and detection, opening up quantum enhancements for mid-IR applications such as biomedical imaging, communication, and remote sensing.},

Under the degenerate Type II spontaneous parametric downconversion process satisfying the EPM condition, an input single photon with a frequency of 2\&\#x03C9; generates a pair of synchronized photons with identical frequencies of \&\#x03C9; that are orthogonally polarized with respect to each other (i.e., the frequency-coincident, polarization-entangled biphoton states). Our simulation results illustrate that the EPM is achievable in the mid-IR spectral region: at the wavelengths of 3.80 \&\#x03BC;m and 4.03 \&\#x03BC;m for periodic 90\&\#x00B0;- and 180\&\#x00B0;-domain structures, respectively. We will describe in detail the EPM properties of both cases in terms of interaction types and the corresponding nonlinear optic coefficients, phase-matching bandwidths, and domain poling periods. The calculated EPM bandwidths are much broader than 200 nm in the mid-IR for both cases, exhibiting a great potential for nonlinear-optic signal processing in quantum communication systems operating in the mid-IR bands.},

Typically, silica fibers are used to deliver light to the detectors inside the cryostat, which works well for wavelengths from visible through 1550 nm. To access longer-wavelength infrared photons, other types of fibers, such as chalcogenide and fluoride fibers, need to be used. Here, we examine the infrared-wavelength transmission of straight and coiled silica optical fibers as candidates to couple infrared light to SNSPDs. We find that the silica fibers offer good transmission up to 2.2 \&\#x003BC;m wavelength. Above this wavelength, the transmission rolls off; the fibers exhibit 3 dB/m loss at 2.5 \&\#x003BC;m. High bend-loss sensitivity of some fibers can be used to adjust the long-wavelength transmission cutoff of the fiber to limit noise photons due to blackbody radiation.},

  abstract = {Summary Spectrally intrinsically uncorrelated biphoton states generated from nonlinear crystals are very important but rare resources for quantum photonics and quantum information applications. Previously, such biphoton states were generated from several kinds of crystals, however, their wavelength ranges and nonlinear efficiencies were still limited for various applications. In order to explore new crystal for wider wavelength range and higher nonlinear efficiency, here we theoretically study the generation of spectrally uncorrelated biphoton states from 14 crystals in the ¡°BBO family,¡± including BBO, CLBO, KABO, KBBF, RBBF, CBBF, BABF, BiBO, LBO, CBO, LRB4, LCB, YCOB, and GdCOB. They satisfy three kinds of group-velocity matching condition from near-infrared to telecom wavelengths. Furthermore, heralded single photons can be generated with a purity as high as 0.98, which is achieved without any narrow filtering. The indistinguishability of photons from independent sources is examined by the Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, which results in a visibility of 98\% also without any further filtering, that is, photons from different heralded single-photon sources are highly indistinguishable. Our study may provide single-photon sources with good performance for quantum information processing at near-infrared and telecom wavelengths.},

By numerical calculation, it was found that the five crystals from the KTP family can be used to generate heralded single photons with high spectral purity and wide tunability. Under the type-0 phase-matching condition, the purity at 1550 nm was between 0.91 and 0.92, and the purity can be maintained over 0.90 from 1500 nm to 2000 nm wavelength. Under the type-II phase-matching condition, the purity at 1550 nm was 0.96, 0.97, 0.97, 0.98, and 0.98 for PPKTP, PPRTP, PPKTA, PPRTA, and PPCTA, respectively; furthermore, the purity can be kept over 0.96 for more than 600 nm wavelength range. We also simulated the Hong--Ou--Mandel interference between independent photon sources for PPRTP crystals at 1550 nm, and interference visibility was 92\% (97\%) under the type-0 (type-II) phase-matching condition. This study may provide spectrally pure narrowband single-photon sources for quantum memories and quantum networks at telecom wavelengths.},

  abstract  = {We introduce a method for shaping the spectral response of nonlinear light sources by tailoring the quasi-phase matching. Our algorithm relies on engineering the poling to accurately trace a generated target signal field amplitude to determine the desired nonlinearity profile. The proposed poling algorithm results in a poling pattern that is more robust to manufacture, as all domain inversions are of equal width. The poling pattern is verified using a nonlinear beam propagation method simulation. This approach is applied to achieve Gaussian-shaped phase matching along a potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) crystal in order to generate pure heralded single photons of spectral purity ~0.996\&\#x02014;this is highly desirable for heralded single photon quantum optics.},

  abstract  = {We use pulsed spontaneous parametric down-conversion in KTiOPO\&\#x000A0;4, with a Gaussian phase-matching function and a transform-limited Gaussian pump, to achieve near-unity spectral purity in heralded single photons at telecommunication wavelength. Theory shows that these phase-matching and pump conditions are sufficient to ensure that a biphoton state with a circularly symmetric joint spectral intensity profile is transform limited and factorable. We verify the heralded-state spectral purity in a four-fold coincidence measurement by performing Hong-Ou-Mandel interference between two independently generated heralded photons. With a mild spectral filter we obtain an interference visibility of 98\&\#x0002E;4\&\#x000B1;1\&\#x0002E;1\&\#x00025; which corresponds to a heralded-state purity of 99.2\&\#x00025;.

Single-photon sources based on nonlinear parametric processes typically require lossy spectral filtering for enhancing the spectral purity of the heralded photons. Here, we implement a novel domain-engineering technique for tailoring the nonlinearity of a parametric down-conversion crystal in order to generate indistinguishable and spectrally pure photons without filtering. We create pairs of independently heralded telecom-wavelength photons with high heralding efficiency (up to 65\%) and brightness (4\&\#x00A0;kHz/mW), and we demonstrate a high lower bound for the indistinguishability (98.7\&\#x00B1;0.2\%) and spectral purity (90.7\&\#x00B1;0.3\%) via two-photon interference experiments.},

The tilt angle of the phase-matching function and the corresponding poling period are calculated under type-II, type-I, and type-0 phase-matching conditions. We also calculate the thermal properties of the doped LN crystals and their performance in Hong-Ou-Mandel interference. It is found that the doping ratio has a substantial impact on the group-velocity-matching (GVM) wavelengths. Especially, the GVM2 wavelength of co-doped InZnLN crystal has a tunable range of 678.7 nm, which is much broader than the tunable range of less than 100 nm achieved by the conventional method of adjusting the temperature. It can be concluded that the doping ratio can be utilized as a degree of freedom to manipulate the biphoton state. The spectrally uncorrelated biphotons can be used to prepare pure single-photon source and entangled photon source, which may have promising applications for quantum-enhanced sensing, imaging, and communications at the MIR range.},

  abstract  = {Direct detection of mid-infrared (MIR) at room temperature commonly suffers from the high background noise and the lack of ideal sensor material. An indirect upconversion method based on nonlinear optics bridges the desired MIR region to the well-developed near-infrared devices. In this paper, we report an experimental study of 3--8 {\textmu}m MIR upconversion detection with a 1 {\textmu}m laser-pumped BaGa4Se7 crystal. This detection scheme is integrated with an optical parametric oscillator and an optical receiver to form a coherent source and detection system that offers high temporal (nanosecond time scale) and spectral resolution ($\leq$3cm{\textminus}1). The wide response band (\&gt;1.4 octave) and large dynamic range (11.5 orders) of this detection scheme benefits from the superior optical properties of this non-oxide crystal, and a minimum detectable energy of 1.02 fJ/pulse is observed with an InGaAs p-i-n photodiode. The upconversion technique outperforms commercial HgCdTe detectors in terms of both sensitivity (2--4.5 orders better) and wavelength response flatness. The aforementioned characteristics of this integrated MIR source and detection system make it of significant interest for applications in high-resolution gas analysis and spectral imaging.},

However, there is still a lack of high-quality quantum light sources in the MIR band, such as the spectrally pure single-photon source. In this work, the generation of a spectrally-pure state in an optimized poled lithium niobate crystal using a metaheuristic algorithm is presented. In particular, the particle swarm optimization algorithm is adopted to optimize the duty cycle of the poling period of the lithium niobate crystal. With this approach, the spectral purity can be improved from 0.820 to 0.998 under the third group-velocity-matched condition, and the wavelength-tunable range from 3.0 to 4.0 µm for the degenerate case and 3.0 to 3.7 µm for the nondegenerate case. This work paves the way for developing quantum photonic technologies at the MIR wavelength band.},

We report on what we believe to be new physical properties that are relevant for laser and nonlinear optical applications and summarize all relevant characteristics, both from the literature and as measured in the present work. With respect to AgGaS(e)2 ternary chalcopyrite materials, LiInSe2 displays a nearly isotropic thermal expansion behavior with three- to five-times-larger thermal conductivities associated with high optical damage thresholds, and low intensity-dependent absorption, allowing direct high-power downconversion from the near-infrared, especially 1064 nm, to the deep mid-infrared. Continuous-wave difference-frequency generation (5.9\&\#x2013;8.1\&\#x2009;\&\#x3bc;m) of Ti:sapphire laser sources is reported for the first time as well as nanosecond optical parametric oscillation with a Nd:YAG laser as the pump source at 100 Hz and idler tuning between 4.7 and 8.7\&\#x2009;\&\#x3bc;m.},

However, the current entangled states are mainly prepared in the visible or near-infrared bands. It is still lacking high-quality entangled photon sources in the MIR band. In this work, we optimize the poling sequence of lithium niobate to prepare two kinds of typical entangled states, the Hermit--Gaussian state and the comb-like entangled state at 3.2 {\textmu}m. We have also calculated the photon pair rates and estimated the effect of fabrication resolution in the schemes. Our approach will provide entangled photon sources with excellent performance for the study of quantum information in the MIR band.},

ABSTRACT = {The current state of the art of single-photon detectors operating in the mid-infrared wavelength range is reported in this review. These devices are essential for a wide range of applications, such as mid-infrared quantum communications, sensing, and metrology, which require detectors with high detection efficiency, low dark count rates, and low dead times. The technological challenge of moving from the well-performing and commercially available near-infrared single-photon detectors to mid-infrared detection is discussed. Different approaches are explored, spanning from the stoichiometric or geometric engineering of a large variety of materials for infrared applications to the exploitation of alternative novel materials and the implementation of proper detection schemes. The three most promising solutions are described in detail: superconductive nanowires, avalanche photodiodes, and photovoltaic detectors.},

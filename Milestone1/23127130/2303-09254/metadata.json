    "abstract": "We study the time evolution of magnetic fields in various configurations of axions with spatially inhomogeneous wavefunctions. The generalization of the induction equation for the magnetic field is derived for such systems. Basing on this equation, we study, first, the evolution of two Chern-Simons (CS) waves interacting with a linearly decreasing axion wavefunction. The nonzero gradient of axions results in the mixing between these CS waves. Then, we consider the problem in a compact domain, when an initial CS wave is mirror symmetric. In this situation, the inhomogeneity of axions acts as the effective modification of the $α$-dynamo parameter. Thus, we conclude that the influence of spatially inhomogeneous axion on the magnetic field evolution strongly depends on the geometry of the system.",

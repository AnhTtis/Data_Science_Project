    "abstract": "We study the energy conservation for the weak solutions to the compressible Primitive Equations (CPE) system with degenerate viscosity. We give sufficient conditions on the regularity of weak solutions for the energy equality to hold, even for solutions that may include a vacuum. In this paper, we give two theorems, the first one gives regularity in the classical isotropic Sobolev and Besov spaces. The second one state result in anisotropic spaces. We get new regularity results in the second theorem because of the special structure of the CPE system, which is in contrast to compressible Navier-Stokes equations.",

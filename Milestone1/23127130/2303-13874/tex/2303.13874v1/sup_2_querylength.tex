\section{Further study on model performance on varying lengths of the query.}
% version1
% As discussed in the limitation, QD-DETR may highly depend on the quality of provided ground truth text descriptions.
% And as we think the queries with longer lengths may have a higher chance of including noisy texts, we divide the validation set into 3 groups each with long-, medium-, and short-length queries, and report the query-length-wise performances of QD-DETR in \cref{table_CATE_baselines}.
% As shown, QD-DETR works well regardless of the query length, showing [36.7, 28.0, 26.3\%] and [7.3, 11.8, 11.1\%] improvements in mAP each for MR and HD with [Short, Medium, Long] queries.
% This study implies that while irrelevant text descriptions for video contexts can degrade the effectiveness of QD-DETR, QD-DETR is robust for meaningless words that are commonly present in text queries.

% version2
As discussed in the limitation, the performance of QD-DETR may depend on the quality of provided ground truth text descriptions.
Yet, this does not imply the QD-DETR's vulnerability against commonly used meaningless words in text descriptions.
As we think the queries with longer lengths may have a higher chance of including noisy texts, we divide the validation set into 3 groups each with long-, medium-, and short-length queries, and report the query-length-wise performances of QD-DETR in \cref{table_CATE_baselines}.
As shown, QD-DETR works well regardless of the query length, showing [36.7, 28.0, 26.3\%] and [7.3, 11.8, 11.1\%] improvements in mAP each for MR and HD with [Short, Medium, Long] queries.
This study implies that while irrelevant~(wrong) text descriptions for video contexts can degrade the effectiveness of QD-DETR, QD-DETR is robust against meaningless words that are commonly present in text queries.
% SE: 말하는 내용은 동일한 것 같네요. version2로 가는 것도 좋아보입니다.


% Also, we believe that the quality of query cannot be solely determined by \textbf{query length} as QD-DETR outperforms the baseline in all cases with different query lengths, as shown in Tab.~\ref{table_CATE_baselines} (Bottom).

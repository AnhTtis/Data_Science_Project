    "abstract": "An important facet of the inverse eigenvalue problem for graphs is to\ndetermine the minimum number of distinct eigenvalues of a particular graph. We\nresolve this question for the join of a connected graph with a path. We then\nfocus on bordering a matrix and attempt to control the change in the number of\ndistinct eigenvalues induced by this operation. By applying bordering\ntechniques to the join of graphs, we obtain numerous results on the nature of\nthe minimum number of distinct eigenvalues as vertices are joined to a fixed\ngraph.",

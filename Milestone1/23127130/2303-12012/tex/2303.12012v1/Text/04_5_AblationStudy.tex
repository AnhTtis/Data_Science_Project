\paragraph{Regularizations on validity.}
We conduct an ablation study on the regularizations about validity, i.e. $\mathcal{L}_{bce}$ and $\mathcal{L}_{sparse}$.
As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ablation_validity} (c), by setting $\mathcal{L}_{bce}=0$, the renderer tends to generate rendering probability between 0 and 1, thus resulting in noisy faces in the output mesh; as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ablation_validity} (d), by setting $\mathcal{L}_{sparse}=0$, the renderer will keep the redundant surfaces, instead of learning a validity space as sparse as possible.


% Xiaoxu: sigmoid_factor doesn't affect that much
% \paragraph{Sigmoid factor (enforce consistency between meshing and rendering)}
% Goal: Consistency between the result from regression and from classification

\paragraph{Reconstruct with different number of views.}
We additionally show results on reconstruction with different number of views. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ablation_n_views}, our method is able to reconstruct open surfaces even with sparse viewpoints. The reconstruction quality improves with the increase of views, quantitively and qualitatively. 



% Not that important
% \paragraph{Reconstructing thin structures (w. vs. w/o mask regularization)}
% As described in Section~\ref{sec:method_training}, if a pixel is sensitive to dilation or erosion, we consider this pixel as part of the sensitive region. We use higher mask weight for the sensitive regions.

\subsection{Multiview Reconstruction on Closed Surfaces}
\vspace{-0.5em}
% We investigate if our method is applicable to multi-view reconstruction in real-world scenarios. For this experiment, we do not condition our model and train one model per object.

We compare our approach with the state-of-the-art volume and surface rendering based methods - HFS~\cite{wang2022hfneus}, NeuS~\cite{wang2021neus} and IDR~\cite{yariv2020idr}, and a classic mesh reconstruction and novel view synthesis method -- NeRF~\cite{mildenhall2020nerf}. We report the quantitative results in Table~\ref{table:comparison_watertight}.

We also show visual comparison with a widely-used MVS method: COLMAP~\cite{schoenberger2016sfm, schoenberger2016mvs}. 
We show qualitative results in Fig.~\ref{fig:comparison_watertight}. The results reconstructed with the proposed method show comparable quality compared with the state-of-the-art. 


% To evaluate our approach and baseline methods, we use 8 categories from the DeepFashion3D Dataset~\cite{zhu2020deep}: long sleeve upper, short-sleeve upper, long sleeve dress, short sleeve dress, no sleeve dress, long pants, short pants, and skirt. And we use TODO categories from the MGN Dataset~\cite{bhatnagar2019mgn}: TShirtNoCoat, ShirtNoCoat, LongCoat, Pants, ShortPants. The dataset contain clothes a wide variety of materials, appearance and geometry, including challenging cases for reconstruction algorithms. We render the meshes to generate 216 images with the image resolution of $256 \times 256$. 

% To validate that our approach could represent closed surfaces. We use 5 scenes from the DTU dataset~\cite{jensen2014large}. Each scene contains 49 or 64 images with the image resolution of $1600 \times 1200$.

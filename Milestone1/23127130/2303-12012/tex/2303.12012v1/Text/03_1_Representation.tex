Our representation is able to reconstruct 3D surfaces with arbitrary topologies without 3D ground-truth data for training. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:surface_representation}, by taking the SDF (Figure~\ref{fig:surface_representation} (a)) and validity probability (Figure~\ref{fig:surface_representation} (b)) into consideration together, we acquire additional information that the bottom line in Figure~\ref{fig:surface_representation} (a) is invalid.
{We discard parts of the reconstructed surface according to the validity score and extract an open surface as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:surface_representation} (d) with the Marching Cubes algorithm~\cite{marching_cubes}. }
% By setting $\vldty(\textbf{p})<0.5$ as \nan, we can extract an open surface as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:surface_representation} (d) with the Marching Cubes algorithm~\cite{marching_cubes}. 
% Hence, the validity probability function acts as a surface eliminator. We describe the details of our method in this section.
%\brandon{I think Figure~\ref{fig:surface_representation}(b) is very confusing. I understand you want to demonstrate the effects of validity, but revierers may not understand this. We claim we deal with arbitrary surfaces, but how to we get a closed SDF field? If I were the reviewer, I would have this question.} \xiaoxu{What I want to demonstrate is that SDF $+$ Validity is able to represent arbitrary shapes. ``How to we get a closed SDF field" is another question that we will answer in the following sections.}

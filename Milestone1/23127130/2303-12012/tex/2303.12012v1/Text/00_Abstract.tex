Recent progress in neural implicit functions has set new state-of-the-art in reconstructing high-fidelity 3D shapes from a collection of images. 
However, these approaches are limited to closed surfaces as they require the surface to be represented by a signed distance field.
In this paper, we propose \modelName{}, a new neural rendering framework that can learn implicit surfaces with arbitrary topologies from multi-view images. 
In particular, \modelName{} represents the 3D surface as a level set of a signed distance function (SDF) with a validity branch for estimating the surface existence probability at the query positions.
We also develop a novel neural volume rendering method, which uses SDF and validity to calculate the volume opacity and avoids rendering points with low validity. 
\modelName{} supports easy field-to-mesh conversion using the classic Marching Cubes algorithm. 
Extensive experiments on  DTU~\cite{dtu}, MGN~\cite{bhatnagar2019mgn}, and Deep Fashion 3D~\cite{zhu2020deep} datasets indicate that our approach is able to faithfully reconstruct both watertight and non-watertight surfaces.
In particular, \modelName{} significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in the task of open surface reconstruction both quantitatively and qualitatively.

% % In this paper, we propose \modelName: Learning Implicit Surfaces with Arbitrary Topologies from Multi-view Images, which can learn high-quality implicit representation of arbitrary surfaces from 2D images.
% % Existing neural surface reconstruction approaches~\cite{dvr, yariv2020idr} and volumetric reconstruction approaches~\cite{wang2021neus, mildenhall2020nerf} produce high-fidelity reconstruction and successfully reconstruct objects with occlusions and complex structures.
% Recent progress in neural implicit functions have set new state-of-the-art in reconstructing high-fidelity 3D shapes and handling objects with occlusions and complex structures. 
% However, these approaches are limited to closed surfaces as they require the space to be represented by a signed distance field.
% % More recent works based on unsigned distance function have been proposed to handle geometries with open surfaces. Nonetheless, as their direct outputs are point clouds, robustly obtaining high-quality meshing results from discrete points remains an open question.
% In this paper, we propose \modelName{}, a new neural rendering framework that can learn implicit surfaces with arbitrary topologies from multi-view images. 
% In particular, \modelName{} represents the 3D surface as a level set of a signed distance function with a validity branch for estimating whether the surface should exist in the query position. 
% We also develop a novel differentiable volume rendering method, which uses SDF and validity to calculate the volume opacity and avoids rendering points with low validity.

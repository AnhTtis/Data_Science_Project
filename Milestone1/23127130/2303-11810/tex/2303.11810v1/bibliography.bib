  abstract = {As indispensable as the internet has become in our daily lives, it still has many shortcomings, not least of which is that communication can be intercepted and information stolen. If, however, the internet attained the capability of transmitting quantum information—qubits—many of these security concerns would be addressed. Wehner et al. review what it will take to achieve this so-called quantum internet and propose stages of development that each correspond to increasingly powerful applications. Although a full-blown quantum internet, with functional quantum computers as nodes connected through quantum communication channels, is still some ways away, the first long-range quantum networks are already being planned. Science, this issue p. eaam9288 The internet—a vast network that enables simultaneous long-range classical communication—has had a revolutionary impact on our world. The vision of a quantum internet is to fundamentally enhance internet technology by enabling quantum communication between any two points on Earth. Such a quantum internet may operate in parallel to the internet that we have today and connect quantum processors in order to achieve capabilities that are provably impossible by using only classical means. Here, we propose stages of development toward a full-blown quantum internet and highlight experimental and theoretical progress needed to attain them.},

We demonstrate a prototype system, operating on-demand, by interfacing a warm vapour, high time-bandwidth-product Raman memory with a travelling wave spontaneous parametric down-conversion source. We store single photons and observe a clear influence of the input photon statistics on the retrieved light, which we find currently to be limited by noise. We develop a theoretical model that identifies four-wave mixing as the sole important noise source and point towards practical solutions for noise-free operation.},

We utilize velocity-selective optical pumping to prepare multiple velocity classes in the F$=$4 hyperfine ground state of cesium. The frequency spacing of the classes is chosen to coincide with the F$\prime$$=$4{\textminus}F$\prime$$=$5 hyperfine splitting of the 62P3/2 excited state, resulting in a broadband periodic absorbing structure consisting of two usually Doppler-broadened optical transitions. Weak coherent states of duration 2ns are mapped into this atomic frequency comb with pre-programmed recall times of 8ns and 12ns, with multi-temporal mode storage and recall demonstrated. Utilizing two transitions in the comb leads to an additional interference effect upon rephasing that enhances the recall efficiency.},

  abstract = {By harnessing aspects of quantum mechanics, communication and information processing could be radically transformed. Promising forms of quantum information technology include optical quantum cryptographic systems and computing using photons for quantum logic operations. As with current information processing systems, some form of memory will be required. Quantum repeaters, which are required for long distance quantum key distribution, require quantum optical memory as do deterministic logic gates for optical quantum computing. Here, we present results from a coherent optical memory based on warm rubidium vapour and show 87{\%} efficient recall of light pulses, the highest efficiency measured to date for any coherent optical memory suitable for quantum information applications. We also show storage and recall of up to 20 pulses from our system. These results show that simple warm atomic vapour systems have clear potential as a platform for quantum memory.},

  abstract = {We implement a new, noise-free, broadband light storage scheme, opening the way to faithful multiphoton synchronization. Future quantum photonic networks require coherent optical memories for synchronizing quantum sources and gates of probabilistic nature. We demonstrate a fast ladder memory (FLAME) mapping the optical field onto the superposition between electronic orbitals of rubidium vapor. Using a ladder-level system of orbital transitions with nearly degenerate frequencies simultaneously enables high bandwidth, low noise, and long memory lifetime. We store and retrieve 1.7-ns-long pulses, containing 0.5 photons on average, and observe short-time external efficiency of 25\%, memory lifetime (1/e) of 86 ns, and below 10−4 added noise photons. Consequently, coupling this memory to a probabilistic source would enhance the on-demand photon generation probability by a factor of 12, the highest number yet reported for a noise-free, room temperature memory. This paves the way toward the controlled production of large quantum states of light from probabilistic photon sources.},

  abstract = {Quantum networks provide opportunities and challenges across a range of intellectual and technical frontiers, including quantum computation, communication and metrology. The realization of quantum networks composed of many nodes and channels requires new scientific capabilities for generating and characterizing quantum coherence and entanglement. Fundamental to this endeavour are quantum interconnects, which convert quantum states from one physical system to those of another in a reversible manner. Such quantum connectivity in networks can be achieved by the optical interactions of single photons and atoms, allowing the distribution of entanglement across the network and the teleportation of quantum states between nodes.},

  abstract = {Future quantum networks will enable the distribution of entanglement between distant locations and allow applications in quantum communication, quantum sensing and distributed quantum computation1. At the core of this network lies the ability to generate and store entanglement at remote, interconnected quantum nodes2. Although various remote physical systems have been successfully entangled3-12, none of these realizations encompassed all of the requirements for network operation, such as compatibility with telecommunication (telecom) wavelengths and multimode operation. Here we report the demonstration of heralded entanglement between two spatially separated quantum nodes, where the entanglement is stored in multimode solid-state quantum memories. At each node a praseodymium-doped crystal13,14 stores a photon of a correlated pair15, with the second photon at telecom wavelengths. Entanglement between quantum memories placed in different laboratories is heralded by the detection of a telecom photon at a rate up to 1.4 kilohertz, and the entanglement is stored in the crystals for a pre-determined storage time up to 25 microseconds. We also show that the generated entanglement is robust against loss in the heralding path, and demonstrate temporally multiplexed operation, with 62 temporal modes. Our realization is extendable to entanglement over longer distances and provides a viable route towards field-deployed, multiplexed quantum repeaters based on solid-state resources.},

In 1984 and 1991, the first protocol for quantum cryptography and the first application of quantum non-locality, respectively, attracted interest from a diverse field of researchers in theoretical and experimental physics, mathematics and computer science. Since then we have seen a fundamental shift in how we understand information when it is encoded in quantum systems. We review the current state of research and future directions in this field of science with special emphasis on quantum key distribution and quantum networks.},

  abstract = {A quantum internet that connects remote quantum processors1,2 should enable a number of revolutionary applications such as distributed quantum computing. Its realization will rely on entanglement of remote quantum memories over long distances. Despite enormous progress3-12, at present the maximal physical separation achieved between two nodes is 1.3 kilometres10, and challenges for longer distances remain. Here we demonstrate entanglement of two atomic ensembles in one laboratory via photon transmission through city-scale optical fibres. The atomic ensembles function as quantum memories that store quantum states. We use cavity enhancement to efficiently create atom-photon entanglement13-15 and we use quantum frequency conversion16 to shift the atomic wavelength to telecommunications wavelengths. We realize entanglement over 22 kilometres of field-deployed fibres via two-photon interference17,18 and entanglement over 50 kilometres of coiled fibres via single-photon interference19. Our experiment could be extended to nodes physically separated by similar distances, which would thus form a functional segment of the atomic quantum network, paving the way towards establishing atomic entanglement over many nodes and over much longer distances.},

  abstract  = {Quantum memories with long storage times are key elements in long-distance quantum networks. The atomic frequency comb (AFC) memory in particular has shown great promise to fulfill this role, having demonstrated multimode capacity and spin-photon quantum correlations. However, the memory storage times have so-far been limited to about 1 ms, realized in a Eu3+ doped Y2SiO5 crystal at zero applied magnetic field. Motivated by studies showing increased spin coherence times under applied magnetic field, we developed an AFC spin-wave memory utilizing a weak 15 mT magnetic field in a specific direction that allows efficient optical and spin manipulation for AFC memory operations. With this field configuration the AFC spin-wave storage time increased to 40 ms using a simple spin-echo sequence. Furthermore, by applying dynamical decoupling techniques the spin-wave coherence time reaches 530 ms, a 300-fold increase with respect to previous AFC spin-wave storage experiments. This result paves the way towards long duration storage of quantum information in solid-state ensemble memories.},

  abstract = {Global-scale quantum communication links will form the backbone of the quantum internet. However, exponential loss in optical fibres precludes any realistic application beyond few hundred kilometres. Quantum repeaters and space-based systems offer solutions to overcome this limitation. Here, we analyse the use of quantum memory (QM)-equipped satellites for quantum communication focussing on global range repeaters and memory-assisted (MA-) QKD, where QMs help increase the key rate by synchronising otherwise probabilistic detection events. We demonstrate that satellites equipped with QMs provide three orders of magnitude faster entanglement distribution rates than existing protocols based on fibre-based repeaters or space systems without QMs. We analyse how entanglement distribution performance depends on memory characteristics, determine benchmarks to assess the performance of different tasks and propose various architectures for light-matter interfaces. Our work provides a roadmap to realise unconditionally secure quantum communications over global distances with near-term technologies.},

At the same time, they are the seeds for future disruptive technological applications of quantum physics. Remarkably, a space-based environment may open many new avenues for exploring and employing quantum physics and technologies. Recently, space missions employing quantum technologies for fundamental or applied studies have been proposed and implemented with stunning results. The combination of quantum physics and its space application is the focus of this review: we cover both the fundamental scientific questions that can be tackled with quantum technologies in space and the possible implementation of these technologies for a variety of academic and commercial purposes.},

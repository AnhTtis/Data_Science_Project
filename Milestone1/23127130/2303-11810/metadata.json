    "abstract": "Investigating and verifying the connections between the foundations of quantum mechanics and general relativity will require extremely sensitive quantum experiments. To provide ultimate insight into this fascinating area of physics, the realization of dedicated experiments in space will sooner or later become a necessity. Quantum technologies, and among them quantum memories in particular, are providing novel approaches to reach conclusive experimental results due to their advanced state of development backed by decades of progress. Storing quantum states for prolonged time will make it possible to study Bell tests on astronomical baselines, to increase measurement precision for investigations of gravitational effects on quantum systems, or enable distributed networks of quantum sensors and clocks. We here promote the case of exploiting quantum memories for fundamental physics in space, and discuss both distinct experiments as well as potential quantum memory platforms and their performance.",

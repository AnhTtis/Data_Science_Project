    "abstract": "It is shown that Vopěnka's Principle (VP) can restore almost the entire ZF over a weak fragment of it. Namely, if EST is the theory consisting of the axioms of Extensionality, Empty Set, Pairing, Union, Cartesian Product, $Δ_0$-Separation and Induction along $ω$, then ${\\rm EST+VP}$ proves the axioms of Infinity, Replacement (thus also Separation) and Powerset. The result was motivated by previous results in \\cite{Tz14}, as well as by H. Friedman's \\cite{Fr05}, where a distinction is made among various forms of VP. As a corollary, ${\\rm EST}+$Foundation$+{\\rm VP}$=${\\rm ZF+VP}$, and ${\\rm EST}+$Foundation$+{\\rm AC+VP}={\\rm ZFC+VP}$. Also it is shown that the Foundation axiom is independent from ZF--\\{Foundation\\}+${\\rm VP}$. It is open whether the Axiom of Choice is independent from ${\\rm ZF+VP}$. A very weak form of choice follows from VP and some similar other forms of choice are introduced.",

\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
Many natural language processing (NLP) tasks rely on labeled data to train machine learning models with high performance. However, data annotation is time-consuming and expensive, especially when the task involves a large amount of data or requires specialized domains. 
Recently, GPT-3.5 series models have demonstrated remarkable few-shot and zero-shot ability across various NLP tasks. 
In this paper, we first claim that large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-3.5, can serve as an excellent crowdsourced annotator when provided with sufficient guidance and demonstrated examples. 
Accordingly, 
we propose AnnoLLM, 
an annotation system powered by LLMs, which adopts a two-step approach, \textit{explain-then-annotate}. 
Concretely, we first prompt LLMs to provide explanations for why the specific ground truth answer/label was assigned for a given example. 
Then, we construct the few-shot chain-of-thought prompt with the self-generated explanation and employ it to annotate the unlabeled data with LLMs. 
Our experiment results on three tasks, including user input and keyword relevance assessment, BoolQ, and WiC, demonstrate that AnnoLLM surpasses or performs on par with crowdsourced annotators. 
Furthermore, we build the first conversation-based information retrieval dataset employing AnnoLLM.  This dataset is designed to facilitate the development of retrieval models capable of retrieving pertinent documents for conversational text. Human evaluation has validated the dataset's high quality.

% \section*{Limitations}
% EMNLP 2023 requires all submissions to have a section titled ``Limitations'', for discussing the limitations of the paper as a complement to the discussion of strengths in the main text. This section should occur after the conclusion, but before the references. It will not count towards the page limit.  

% The discussion of limitations is mandatory. Papers without a limitation section will be desk-rejected without review.
% ARR-reviewed papers that did not include ``Limitations'' section in their prior submission, should submit a PDF with such a section together with their EMNLP 2023 submission.

% While we are open to different types of limitations, just mentioning that a set of results have been shown for English only probably does not reflect what we expect. 
% Mentioning that the method works mostly for languages with limited morphology, like English, is a much better alternative.
% In addition, limitations such as low scalability to long text, the requirement of large GPU resources, or other things that inspire crucial further investigation are welcome.

% \section*{Ethics Statement}
% Scientific work published at EMNLP 2023 must comply with the \href{https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/acl-code-ethics}{ACL Ethics Policy}. We encourage all authors to include an explicit ethics statement on the broader impact of the work, or other ethical considerations after the conclusion but before the references. The ethics statement will not count toward the page limit (8 pages for long, 4 pages for short papers).

    \textbf{Input}  & Directions: Given a search engine query: "\textbf{google data studio sharepoint}", first, consider what the user could have in mind when they type in the query and allow for misspellings or other ambiguity, then classify the relevance of keyword: "\textbf{sharepoint migration tool file share}" to the query into one of the following categories: "Not bad", "Bad". The definitions of the categories are\newline
"Not bad": the keyword is relevant to the user's search query. This can include: broader or narrower product selection, competitor or alternative products, accessories, products often purchased together and related topics as well as direct matches to the user's search.\newline
"Bad": the keyword is not relevant to the user's search query. There is no relationship between the query and keyword. This includes but is not limited to: incorrect/unrelated product, unrelated topic, wrong location when location is important, cannot be used in place of query product nor are they commonly purchased together, etc.\newline
Briefly explain why the relevance is "\textbf{Bad}", with a response length not exceeding 100 words.   \\
    \midrule
    \textbf{Output 1}  & The relevance of the keyword "sharepoint migration tool file share" to the search query "google data studio sharepoint" is "Bad". This keyword is not relevant to the user's search query as it pertains to a different tool or technology (SharePoint) that is not mentioned in the search query. The keyword focuses on a migration tool for SharePoint file sharing, while the search query is focused on Google Data Studio. There is no relationship between the two, so the keyword is not relevant to the user's search query.\\
    \midrule
    \textbf{Output 2}  & The relevance of "sharepoint migration tool file share" to the search query "google data studio sharepoint" is "Bad." The keyword is not relevant to the user's search query because it deals with SharePoint migration and file sharing, whereas the user's query is focused on Google Data Studio and SharePoint. There is no relationship between these two topics, and the keyword cannot be used in place of the query product.\\
    \midrule
    \textbf{Output 3}  & The relevance is "Bad". The keyword "sharepoint migration tool file share" is not directly related to the query "google data studio sharepoint". The keyword refers to tools and services for migrating data from SharePoint to another file share platform, whereas the query is about using Google Data Studio to connect with SharePoint data. There is no clear relationship between the two topics.\\
    \midrule
    \textbf{Output 4}  & The relevance of the keyword "sharepoint migration tool file share" to the search query "google data studio sharepoint" is "Bad". The keyword is about a tool for migrating data from SharePoint, which is not directly related to Google Data Studio. Google Data Studio is a data visualization and reporting tool, not a migration tool for SharePoint.\\
    \midrule
    \textbf{Output 5}  & The relevance is "Bad" as the keyword "sharepoint migration tool file share" has no direct relation to the user's search query "google data studio sharepoint". The keyword pertains to a tool used for migrating data within a SharePoint platform, while the query is focused on Google Data Studio and SharePoint. These two concepts are not directly related and therefore, the keyword is not relevant to the user's search query.\\

The target word "place" in the first sentence and the second sentence is enclosed in quotation marks. There is no need to consider the tense and form of "place". If "place" in the first sentence and the second sentence correspond to the same meaning, output "true", otherwise output "false".\newline
Briefly explain why the answer is "\textbf{false}", with a response length not exceeding 100 words.\\
    \midrule
    \textbf{Output 1}  & The answer is "false". In the first sentence, "place" refers to a physical location or a person's home. In the second sentence, "place" refers to a position or status in a political system. Therefore, although the spelling and punctuation of "place" are the same in both sentences, the context and meaning of the word are different.\\
    \midrule
    \textbf{Output 2}  & The answer is "false". In the first sentence, "place" refers to a physical location, meaning a house or an apartment. In contrast, in the second sentence, "place" refers to a figurative location, meaning a position or role within a political system. Therefore, the two occurrences of "place" have different meanings and do not correspond to the same meaning.\\
    \midrule
    \textbf{Output 3}  & The answer is "false". In the first sentence, "place" refers to a physical location or someone's home, while in the second sentence, "place" refers to a position or status in a political system. These are different meanings, and therefore, the occurrences of "place" in the two sentences do not correspond to the same meaning.\\
    \midrule
    \textbf{Output 4}  &The answer is "false". In the first sentence, "place" refers to a physical location, as in a person's home. In contrast, in the second sentence, "place" refers to a position or status within a system or society, as in a group's role or standing. Thus, the two uses of "place" have different meanings, and do not correspond to the same meaning.\\
    \midrule
    \textbf{Output 5}  & The answer is "false". In the first sentence, "place" refers to a physical location where the speaker is inviting someone to come over to. In contrast, in the second sentence, "place" refers to a position or role in a political system. Therefore, the two occurrences of "place" have different meanings and cannot be considered to correspond to the same meaning.

It has a broadly similar structure to Skyrim, with two separate conflicts progressing at the same time, one with the fate of the world in the balance, and one where the prize is supreme power on Tamriel. In The Elder Scrolls Online, the first struggle is against the Daedric Prince Molag Bal, who is attempting to meld the plane of Mundus with his realm of Coldharbour, and the second is to capture the vacant imperial throne, contested by three alliances of the mortal races. The player character has been sacrificed to Molag Bal, and Molag Bal has stolen their soul, the recovery of which is the primary game objective.}", determine if the answer to the question: "\textbf{is elder scrolls online the same as skyrim}" is "yes" or "no".

While it has a similar structure to Skyrim, with two conflicts progressing at the same time, the primary struggle in The Elder Scrolls Online is against the Daedric Prince Molag Bal, who has stolen the player character's soul, and the second is to capture the vacant imperial throne. Therefore, The Elder Scrolls Online is not the same game as Skyrim.\\
    \midrule
    \textbf{Output 2}  & The answer is "false". While The Elder Scrolls Online is set in the same continent of Tamriel as Skyrim, and shares a similar structure with two conflicts happening simultaneously, the events of the game occur a millennium before Skyrim, and its primary antagonist is the Daedric Prince Molag Bal, not Alduin as in Skyrim. The gameplay mechanics and overall experience of The Elder Scrolls Online are also distinct from Skyrim, as it is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG), while Skyrim is a single-player game.\\
    \midrule
    \textbf{Output 3}  & The answer is "false". While The Elder Scrolls Online and Skyrim share the same fictional universe and are part of The Elder Scrolls series, they are not the same game. The Elder Scrolls Online is set a millennium before Skyrim and has a different storyline and gameplay mechanics. In The Elder Scrolls Online, the player fights against Molag Bal and attempts to recover their stolen soul, while in Skyrim, the player character is a Dragonborn who fights against Alduin, the World-Eater. Additionally, The Elder Scrolls Online is a massively multiplayer online game, while Skyrim is a single-player game.\\
    \midrule
    \textbf{Output 4}  &The answer is "false". While The Elder Scrolls Online and Skyrim share some similarities, such as being set in the same continent of Tamriel and having a similar structure, they are different games with different stories and timelines. The events in The Elder Scrolls Online take place a millennium before Skyrim and revolve around two conflicts, one against the Daedric Prince Molag Bal and the other for the vacant imperial throne, while Skyrim has its own unique story centered around the return of the dragons to the world.\\
    \midrule
    \textbf{Output 5}  & The answer is "false". While The Elder Scrolls Online and Skyrim share the same fictional world of Tamriel, they are not the same game. The events of The Elder Scrolls Online take place a millennium before Skyrim, and the game features a different storyline and game structure. In The Elder Scrolls Online, the player character is sacrificed to the Daedric Prince Molag Bal and must recover their soul, while in Skyrim, the player character is a Dragonborn on a quest to defeat the dragon Alduin and save Tamriel from destruction.\\

    Passage: The Elder Scrolls Online -- As with other games in The Elder Scrolls series, the game is set on the continent of Tamriel. The events of the game occur a millennium before those of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and around 800 years before The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. It has a broadly similar structure to Skyrim, with two separate conflicts progressing at the same time, one with the fate of the world in the balance, and one where the prize is supreme power on Tamriel. In The Elder Scrolls Online, the first struggle is against the Daedric Prince Molag Bal, who is attempting to meld the plane of Mundus with his realm of Coldharbour, and the second is to capture the vacant imperial throne, contested by three alliances of the mortal races. The player character has been sacrificed to Molag Bal, and Molag Bal has stolen their soul, the recovery of which is the primary game objective.\\

    Passage: Good Samaritan law -- Good Samaritan laws offer legal protection to people who give reasonable assistance to those who are, or who they believe to be, injured, ill, in peril, or otherwise incapacitated. The protection is intended to reduce bystanders' hesitation to assist, for fear of being sued or prosecuted for unintentional injury or wrongful death. An example of such a law in common-law areas of Canada: a good Samaritan doctrine is a legal principle that prevents a rescuer who has voluntarily helped a victim in distress from being successfully sued for wrongdoing. Its purpose is to keep people from being reluctant to help a stranger in need for fear of legal repercussions should they make some mistake in treatment. By contrast, a duty to rescue law requires people to offer assistance and holds those who fail to do so liable.\\
    Question: do good samaritan laws protect those who help at an accident\\
    Answer: Yes\\

    Passage: Powdered sugar -- Powdered sugar, also called confectioners' sugar, icing sugar, and icing cake, is a finely ground sugar produced by milling granulated sugar into a powdered state. It usually contains a small amount of anti-caking agent to prevent clumping and improve flow. Although most often produced in a factory, powdered sugar can also be made by processing ordinary granulated sugar in a coffee grinder, or by crushing it by hand in a mortar and pestle.\\

    Passage: Federal judiciary of the United States -- The federal courts are composed of three levels of courts. The Supreme Court of the United States is the court of last resort. It is generally an appellate court that operates under discretionary review, which means that the Court can choose which cases to hear, by granting writs of certiorari. There is therefore generally no basic right of appeal that extends automatically all the way to the Supreme Court. In a few situations (like lawsuits between state governments or some cases between the federal government and a state) it sits as a court of original jurisdiction.\\

    Given a search engine query, first, consider what the user could have in mind when they type in the query and allow for misspellings or other ambiguity, then classify the relevance of keyword to the query into one of the following categories: "Not bad", or "Bad". The definitions of the categories are\\
    "Not bad": the keyword is relevant to the user's search query. This can include: broader or narrower product selection, competitor or alternative products, accessories, products often purchased together and related topics as well as direct matches to the user's search.\\
    "Bad": the keyword is not relevant to the user's search query. There is no relationship between the query and keyword. This includes but is not limited to: incorrect/unrelated product, unrelated topic, wrong location when location is important, cannot be used in place of query product nor are they commonly purchased together, etc.\\
    Please predict whether the keyword is relevant to the query or not. The answer should be exact "Not bad" or "Bad".\\
    \\
    Query: google data studio sharepoint\\
    Keyword: sharepoint migration tool file share\\
    Answer: \textbf{\underline{The relevance of the keyword "sharepoint migration tool file share" to the search query "google data} \underline{studio sharepoint" is "Bad".} This keyword is not relevant to the user's search query as it pertains to a different tool or technology (SharePoint) that is not mentioned in the search query. The keyword focuses on a migration tool for SharePoint file sharing, while the search query is focused on Google Data Studio. There is no relationship between the two, so the keyword is not relevant to the user's search query.} \textit{Therefore, the relevance is "Bad".}\\
    \\
    Query: motorhomes sale\\
    Keyword: rv sale used class c\\
    Answer: \textbf{\underline{The relevance of keyword "rv sale used class c" is "Not bad".} The keyword "rv sale used class c" contains relevant information to the user's search query "motorhomes sale". It includes a specific type of motorhome, "class c", that is being sold used, which is a relevant product selection for the user's search. Additionally, the keyword "rv sale used class c" is a direct match to the user's search and is commonly purchased together with the products in the search query.} \textit{Therefore, the relevance is "Not bad".}\\
    \\
    Query: southern exposure seed exchange company\\
    Keyword: uk poppy seeds\\
    Answer: \textbf{\underline{The relevance of the keyword "uk poppy seeds" to the search query "southern exposure seed exchange} \underline{company" is "Not bad".} This is because the search query is about a seed exchange company, and the keyword "uk poppy seeds" is a specific type of seed that could be offered by such a company. Even though the company mentioned in the search query is based in the southern hemisphere, they may still offer seeds from other regions, including the UK, which could include poppy seeds.} \textit{Therefore, the relevance is "Not bad".}\\
    \\
    Query: nissan parts canada\\
    Keyword: purchase tires\\
    Answer: \textbf{\underline{The relevance of "purchase tires" to the query "nissan parts canada" is "Bad".} The keyword "purchase tires" is not directly related to the user's search for Nissan parts in Canada. Tires are not a part of a Nissan car and therefore are not relevant to the search for Nissan parts. Additionally, the keyword does not relate to a common purchase with Nissan parts, and it is not a substitute for the search query.} \textit{Therefore, the relevance is "Bad".}\\

    Task description: The task is to identify if the occurrences of w in s1 and s2 correspond to the same meaning or not. The target word w in s1 and s2 is enclosed in quotation marks. There is no need to consider the tense and form of w. If w in s1 and s2 corresponds to the same meaning, output "true", otherwise output "false". \\
    \\
    w: "place"
    s1: Do you want to come over to my "place" later?\\
    s2: A political system with no "place" for the less prominent groups.\\
    Explanation: \textbf{The answer is "false". In the first sentence, "place" refers to a physical location or a person's home. In the second sentence, "place" refers to a position or status in a political system. Therefore, although the spelling and punctuation of "place" are the same in both sentences, the context and meaning of the word are different.} Therefore, the answer is "false".\\
    \\
    w: "hold"
    s1: The general ordered the colonel to "hold" his position at all costs.\\
    s2: "Hold" the taxi.\\
    Explanation: \textbf{The answer is "true". In both sentences, "hold" means to maintain or stay in a specific position or location. In the first sentence, the general orders the colonel to hold his position at all costs, meaning the colonel should not retreat or move from his current location. In the second sentence, someone is asking the taxi driver to hold, meaning to wait and stay in the current location until the person returns. Therefore, in both sentences, "hold" is used to convey the idea of staying in a particular position or location.} Therefore, the answer is "true".\\
    \\
    w: "summer"\\
    s1: We like to "summer" in the Mediterranean.\\
    s2: We "summered" in Kashmir.\\
    Explanation: \textbf{The answer is "true". In both sentences, "summer" refers to the activity of spending a summer vacation in a certain location. Although the word form is different ("summer" in the first sentence and "summered" in the second), the meaning is the same. The use of quotation marks in both sentences implies that "summer" is being used as a verb, rather than a season. Therefore, both sentences convey the idea of enjoying a summer vacation in different locations, making the meaning the same.} Therefore, the answer is "true".\\
    \\
    w: "approach"\\
    s1: "Approach" a task.\\
    s2: To "approach" the city.\\
    Explanation: \textbf{The answer is "false". In the first sentence, "Approach" is used as a verb and means to begin or undertake a task. In the second sentence, "approach" is also used as a verb but means to move towards or get closer to the city. Although the spelling and the quotation marks around the word are the same in both sentences, the context and the meaning of the word are different. Therefore, the occurrences of "approach" in the two sentences do not correspond to the same meaning.} Therefore, the answer is "false".\\
    \\
    w: "cover"\\
    s1: "Cover" her face with a handkerchief.\\
    s2: Count the cash in the drawer twice just to "cover" yourself.\\
    Explanation: \textbf{The answer is "false". The word "cover" has different meanings in the two sentences. In the first sentence, "cover" means to hide or conceal something. In contrast, in the second sentence, "cover" means to protect oneself from potential problems or accusations. The context and usage of the word "cover" in the two sentences are different, indicating that the two instances of "cover" do not correspond to the same meaning.} Therefore, the answer is "false".\\
    \\
    w: "head"\\
    s1: His horse won by a "head".\\
    s2: He is two "heads" taller than his little sister.\\
    Explanation: \textbf{The answer is "true". In both sentences, "head" is used as a unit of measurement. In the first sentence, it means that the speaker's horse won by a small margin, specifically the length of the horse's head. In the second sentence, it means that the person is taller than their little sister by a specific amount, namely two head lengths. Therefore, in both cases, "head" is used as a measure of distance or height, indicating that the two occurrences correspond to the same meaning.} Therefore, the answer is "true".\\
    \\
    w: "meet"\\
    s1: The company agrees to "meet" the cost of any repairs.\\
    s2: This proposal "meets" my requirements.\\
    Explanation: \textbf{The answer is "true". Although the verb "meet" is used in different senses in the two sentences, in both cases, it conveys the idea of satisfying a requirement or obligation. In the first sentence, the company agrees to pay for any repairs, which is a requirement or obligation. In the second sentence, the proposal fulfills or satisfies the speaker's requirements. Therefore, even though the two sentences use "meet" in different senses, they convey the same general idea of satisfying an obligation or requirement, making the answer "true".} Therefore, the answer is "true".\\

In contrast, in the second sentence, "developments" refer to the latest events or updates on a particular subject. The first sentence refers to a specific stage in the life of an organism, while the second sentence refers to recent events or news related to a particular topic.

The purpose of these laws is to encourage bystanders to provide help without fear of being sued or prosecuted for unintentional injury or wrongful death. In Canada, for example, the good Samaritan doctrine is a legal principle that prevents a rescuer who has voluntarily helped a victim in distress from being successfully sued for wrongdoing. Therefore, individuals who provide reasonable assistance at an accident can be protected by good Samaritan laws.} Therefore, the answer is "Yes".\\

It is a part of Windows Essentials software suite and offers the ability to create and edit videos as well as to publish them on OneDrive, Facebook, Vimeo, YouTube, and Flickr.\\
    Question: is windows movie maker part of windows essentials\\
    Answer: \textbf{The answer to the question "is Windows Movie Maker part of Windows Essentials?" is Yes. As stated in the passage, Windows Movie Maker is a discontinued video editing software by Microsoft and was a part of the Windows Essentials software suite. Windows Essentials was a collection of free software programs from Microsoft, including Photo Gallery, Movie Maker, Mail, Writer, and OneDrive, among others. Therefore, Windows Movie Maker was one of the programs included in the Windows Essentials suite, which was available for download from Microsoft's website.} Therefore, the answer is "Yes".\\

    Passage: Batman \& Robin (film) -- With the box office success of Batman Forever in June 1995, Warner Bros. immediately commissioned a sequel. They hired director Joel Schumacher and writer Akiva Goldsman to reprise their duties the following August, and decided it was best to fast track production for a June 1997 target release date, which is a break from the usual 3-year gap between films. Schumacher wanted to homage both the broad camp style of the 1960s television series and the work of Dick Sprang. The storyline of Batman \& Robin was conceived by Schumacher and Goldsman during pre-production on A Time to Kill. Portions of Mr. Freeze's back-story were based on the Batman: The Animated Series episode ``Heart of Ice'', written by Paul Dini.\\
    Question: is batman and robin a sequel to batman forever\\
    Answer: \textbf{The answer is "Yes". Based on the information provided in the passage, Batman \& Robin is a sequel to Batman Forever. Warner Bros. commissioned the sequel after the box office success of Batman Forever, and hired director Joel Schumacher and writer Akiva Goldsman to continue their duties. The film was fast-tracked for a June 1997 release, with Schumacher and Goldsman conceiving the storyline during pre-production of another movie. Therefore, Batman \& Robin is a direct sequel to Batman Forever, released just two years later.} Therefore, the answer is "Yes".\\

    \textbf{Passage}: The Elder Scrolls Online -- As with other games in The Elder Scrolls series, the game is set on the continent of Tamriel. The events of the game occur a millennium before those of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and around 800 years before The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. It has a broadly similar structure to Skyrim, with two separate conflicts progressing at the same time, one with the fate of the world in the balance, and one where the prize is supreme power on Tamriel. In The Elder Scrolls Online, the first struggle is against the Daedric Prince Molag Bal, who is attempting to meld the plane of Mundus with his realm of Coldharbour, and the second is to capture the vacant imperial throne, contested by three alliances of the mortal races. The player character has been sacrificed to Molag Bal, and Molag Bal has stolen their soul, the recovery of which is the primary game objective.\\

    Answer: The answer is "No". Although The Elder Scrolls Online is set on the continent of Tamriel, like Skyrim and other games in The Elder Scrolls series, it takes place a millennium before Skyrim and around 800 years before Morrowind and Oblivion. While it has a similar structure to Skyrim, with two conflicts progressing at the same time, the primary struggle in The Elder Scrolls Online is against the Daedric Prince Molag Bal, who has stolen the player character's soul, and the second is to capture the vacant imperial throne. Therefore, The Elder Scrolls Online is not the same game as Skyrim. Therefore, the answer is "No".\\

    Given a conversation and passage, first, consider the relevance of the conversation and paragraph, explore the relevant content between the conversation and passage, and then classify the relevance between the conversation and passage into one of the following categories: "Relevant" or "Not Relevant Enough". The definitions of the categories are:\\
    "Not Relevant Enough": The conversation is not relevant enough to the passage, as a small portion of the content may have appeared in the passage, but most of the content in the conversation has not appeared in the passage or is not related to the passage. The content involved in the conversation may not be consistent with the facts described in the passage. For the specific details in the passage, the conversation did not involve relevant details.\\
    "Relevant": Passage and conversation are related. The topic of the conversation is consistent with the paragraph, and the facts mentioned in the conversation are consistent with the facts in the passage. The content of the conversation is mostly related to the paragraph, and can be appropriately expanded.\\
    Here are some examples:\\

    <Answer>\\
    The conversation is discussing how to determine the salary range percentile, which is the topic of the passage. The conversation provides an example that is consistent with the information presented in the passage, and also expands on how to generate the salary range percentile by comparing it to salaries for similar positions. The information in the conversation is relevant and consistent with the information presented in the passage. Therefore, the relecance is "Relevant".\\

    An antigen is any molecule against which a specific immune response can be generated. This means that lymphocytes are activated: 1  B-cells are activated to produce antibodies and. 2  T-cells are activated to provide helper function and cytotoxic function.\\
    <Conversation>\\
    P1: What is the function of lymphocytes?\\
    P2: Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell that are responsible for producing antibodies.\\
    P1: What do antibodies do?\\
    P2: Antibodies attach to the antigens on the surface of bacteria or viruses, which helps the immune system identify and destroy the pathogen.\\
    P1: Can you explain what antigens are?\\
    P2: Antigens are molecules that are found on the surface of bacteria or viruses. They are recognized by the immune system as foreign invaders, and the attachment of antibodies to these antigens helps to destroy the pathogen.\\
    P1: Are different antibodies needed for different types of antigens?\\
    P2: Yes, different organisms have different antigens, so a different antibody is needed to recognize each different type of antigen.\\
    P1: What happens when an antibody attaches to a virus?\\
    P2: When an antibody attaches to a virus, it can either destroy the pathogen or make it easier for a phagocyte to ingest and destroy it. This is an important part of the immune response to viral infections.\\
    <Answer>\\
    Although the conversation is related to the immune system and antibodies, it does not provide any additional information about the functions of B-cells or T-cells as described in the passage. The conversation also does not mention anything about the specific immune response generated by antigens, which is the main topic of the passage. While the conversation provides general information about the immune system and antibodies, it does not expand on the content of the passage or provide any additional relevant details. Therefore, the relecance is "Not Relevant Enough".\\

\section{Details on Human Evaluation}\label{sec.appendix.g}
For the purpose of human evaluation, we begin by presenting annotators with a multi-turn conversation accompanied by a paired passage. Their task involves carefully reading both the conversation and passage, ensuring a comprehensive grasp of the main topics and any significant details. Subsequently, they are required to assess the fluency of the conversation, as well as its relevance and consistency with the provided passage.
\subsection{Fluency}
To evaluate the fluency of the generated conversation, annotators should answer the first question:\\
How fluent do you think the conversation is? 

Following previous study \cite{he-yiu-2022-controllable}, annotators need to score the fluency of the conversation on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 to 5, based on the following rules:\\
    1: The conversation cannot be understood and all segments are not fluent.\\
    2: The conversation cannot be understood, but some segments are fluent.\\
    3: The conversation can be understood to some extent, but with many grammatical errors.\\
    4: The conversation can be understood with several grammatical errors.\\
    5: The conversation is extremely fluent without any grammatical errors.\\

\subsection{Relevance}
To assess the relevance between the generated conversation and the paired passage, graders need to consider the second question:\\
Q2: How relevant do you think the conversation is to the given passage? 

Specifically, graders need to score the relevance between the conversation and the given passage on a 3-point Likert scale from 1 to 3:\\
    1 (Irrelevant): Any topic discussed in the conversation is completely unrelated to the given passage.\\
    2 (Not Relevant Enough): Few topics discussed in the conversation are related to the given passage. \\
    3 (Relevant): Most topics discussed in the conversation are related to the given passage.\\
    
\subsection{Consistency}
As for consistency, graders should answer the following question: \\
Q3: How consistent do you think the conversation is to the given passage? 

To be concrete, graders need to score the consistency between the conversation and the given passage on a 3-point Likert scale from 1 to 3:\\
    1: Any fact mentioned in the conversation does not appear in the given passage.\\
    2: Few facts mentioned in the conversation are supported by the facts in the given passage.\\
    3: Most facts mentioned in the conversation are consistent with the facts in the passage. \\

    "abstract": "In recent years, floor plan segmentation has gained significant attention due to its wide range of applications in floor plan reconstruction and robotics. In this paper, we propose a novel 2D floor plan segmentation technique based on a down-sampling approach. Our method employs continuous down-sampling on a floor plan to maintain its structural information while reducing its complexity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by presenting results obtained from both cluttered floor plans generated by a vacuum cleaning robot in unknown environments and a benchmark of floor plans. Our technique considerably reduces the computational and implementation complexity of floor plan segmentation, making it more suitable for real-world applications. Additionally, we discuss the appropriate metric for evaluating segmentation results. Overall, our approach yields promising results for 2D floor plan segmentation in cluttered environments.",

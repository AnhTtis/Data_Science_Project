Here, we provide the proofs for Propositions~\ref{prop:conditionalProbMinimum} and~\ref{prop:expectationMinimum};
additional details on the proposed new instances of \fwName;
the datasets used for evaluation;
the hyperparameters used by baselines and new instances;
and the computation of metrics and uncertainties used in our evaluation protocol.
We also include the full list of recent methods and their \fwName components, the complete table of results from the experimental evaluation.
In addition, we include additional experiments and analyses of reproducibility, hyperparameters, and the Fusion and CM components.
Finally, we reflect on possible negative societal impacts of our work.

Our implementation of the \fwName framework, as well as the datasets and the evaluation protocol used in our experiments, is available at \githubLink.
See \suppdir{README.md} in the repository for more details about the implementation, and how to reproduce our results.

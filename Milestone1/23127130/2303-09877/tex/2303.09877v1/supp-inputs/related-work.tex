The full list of recent methods and their \fwName components is given in Table~\ref{tab:previousMethodsFull}.
We observe that all but one model includes at least one form of SSL, but the type of SSL, and also fusion and CM, vary significantly for the different models.
This illustrates the importance of the SSL components in deep MVC, as well as the need for a unified framework with a consistent evaluation protocol, in order to properly compare and evaluate methods.

    "abstract": "This paper is devoted to the study of unparameterized simple curves in the plane. We propose diverse canonical parameterizations of a 2D-curve. For instance, the arc-length parameterization is canonical, but we consider other natural parameterizations like the parameterization proportionnal to the curvature of the curve. Both aforementionned parameterizations are very natural and correspond to a natural physical movement: the arc-length parameterization corresponds to travelling along the curve at constant speed, whereas parameterization proportionnal to curvature corresponds to a constant-speed moving frame. Since the curvature function of a curve is a geometric invariant of the unparameterized curve, a parameterization using the curvature function is a canonical parameterization. The main idea is that to any physically meaningful stricktly increasing function is associated a natural parameterization of 2D-curves, which gives an optimal sampling, and which can be used to compare unparameterized curves in a efficient and pertinent way. An application to point correspondance in medical imaging is given.",

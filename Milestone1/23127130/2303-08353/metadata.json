    "abstract": "We study the general quantum Hamiltonian that can be realized with two species of mutually interacting degenerate ultracold atoms in a ring-shaped trap, with the options of rotation and an azimuthal lattice. We examine the spectrum and the states with a collective spin picture in a Dicke state basis. The system can generate states with a high degree of entanglement gauged by the von Neumann entropy. The Hamiltonian has two components, a linear part that can be controlled and switched on via rotation or the azimuthal lattice, and an interaction-dependent quadratic part. Exact solutions are found for the quadratic part for equal strengths of intra-species and the inter-species interactions, but for generally different particle numbers in the two species. The quadratic Hamiltonian has a degenerate ground state when the two species have unequal number of particles, but non-degenerate when equal. We determine the impact on the entanglement entropy of deviations from equal particle numbers as well as deviations from the assumption of equal interaction strengths. Limiting cases are shown to display features of a beam-splitter and spin-squeezing that can find utility in interferometry. The density of states for the full Hamiltonian shows features as of phase transition in varying between linear and quadratic limits.",

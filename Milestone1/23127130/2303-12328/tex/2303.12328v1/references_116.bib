@inproceedings{DL_HB_multiuser, title={{Deep Neural Hybrid Beamforming for Multi-User mmWave Massive MIMO System}}, DOI={10.1109/GlobalSIP45357.2019.8969154}, abstractNote={Hybrid beamforming (HB) has emerged as a promising technology to support ultra high transmission capacity and with low complexity for Millimeter Wave (mmWave) multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) system. However, the design of digital and analog beamformer is a challenge task with non-convex optimization, especially for the multi-user scenario. Recently, the blooming of deep learning research provides a new vision for the signal processing of communication system. In this work, we propose a deep neural network based HB for the multi-User mmWave massive MIMO system, referred as DNHB. The HB system is formulated as an autoencoder neural network, which is trained in a style of end-to-end self-supervised learning. With the strong representation capability of deep neural network, the proposed DNHB exhibits superior performance than the traditional linear processing methods. According to the simulation results, DNHB outperforms about 2 dB in terms of bit error rate (BER) performance compared with existing methods.}, booktitle={2019 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)}, author={Tao, Jiyun and Xing, Jing and Chen, Jienan and Zhang, Chuan and Fu, Shengli}, year={2019}, REDUNDANTmonth={Nov}, pages={1–5} }

	abstract = 	 {We evaluate whether features extracted from the activation of a deep convolutional network trained in a fully supervised fashion on a large, fixed set of object recognition tasks can be re-purposed to novel generic tasks.  Our generic tasks may differ significantly from the originally trained tasks and there may be insufficient labeled or unlabeled data to conventionally train or adapt a deep architecture to the new tasks.  We investigate and visualize the semantic clustering of deep convolutional features with respect to a variety of such tasks, including scene recognition, domain adaptation, and fine-grained recognition challenges.  We compare the efficacy of relying on various network levels to define a fixed feature, and report novel results that significantly outperform the state-of-the-art on several important vision challenges.  We are releasing DeCAF, an open-source implementation of these deep convolutional activation features, along with all associated network parameters to enable vision researchers to be able to conduct experimentation with deep representations across a range of visual concept learning paradigms.}

	abstract = {Three sets of results are contained in this paper. The first is on a new matrix product. If A and B are two matrices of orders p×r and q×r respectively, and if $\boldsymbol{\alpha}_{1},\ldots,\boldsymbol{\alpha}_{r}$ are column vectors of A and $\boldsymbol{\beta}_{1},\ldots,\boldsymbol{\beta}_{r}$ are those of B then the new product $\mathbf{\mathit{A}}\boldsymbol{\odot}\mathbf{\mathit{B}}$ is the partitioned matrix $(\boldsymbol{\alpha}_{1}\boldsymbol{\otimes}\boldsymbol{\beta}_{1}\vdots \boldsymbol{\alpha}_{2}\boldsymbol{\otimes}\boldsymbol{\beta}_{2}\vdots \cdots \vdots \boldsymbol{\alpha}_{r}\boldsymbol{\otimes}\boldsymbol{\beta}_{r})$ where $\boldsymbol{\otimes}$ denotes the Kronecker product. Propositions involving the new product of matrices are stated. The second is on the solution of functional equations of two types. One is of the form $\underset u=1\to{\overset p\to{\Sigma}}c_{ju}\,\psi _{u}(e_{u}^{\prime}\mathbf{\mathit{t}})+\underset i=1\to{\overset r\to{\Sigma}}\ b_{ji}\,\phi _{i}(\boldsymbol{\alpha}_{i}^{\prime}\mathbf{\mathit{t}})=g_{j}\,(\text{constant}),\ j=1,\ldots ,q$ involving a vector variable t where $\mathbf{\mathit{e}}_{u}$ are unit vectors of an identity matrix of order p, $\boldsymbol{\alpha}_{i}$ are given column vectors and $\psi _{u}$, $\phi _{i}$ are unknown continuous functions. Another is of the form $\underset j=1\to{\overset n\to{\Sigma}}d_{ij}\,\phi (b_{j}\,t)=g_{i},\ i=1,\ldots ,q$ involving an unknown function φ of a single variable t. Conditions under which the unknown functions in these two types of equations are polynomials of an assigned degree are given. The third, on the characterization of normal and gamma distributions, extends the earlier work of the authors (Rao, 1967 and Khatri and Rao, 1968). We consider two sets of functions $L_{1},\ldots ,L_{q}$ and $M_{1},\ldots ,M_{p}$ of independent random variables $X_{1},\ldots ,X_{n}$ with the condition $E(L_{i}|M_{1},\ldots ,M_{p})=g_{i}\ (\text{constant})$ for i = 1,..., q. When $L_{i}$ and $M_{j}$ are linear, the $X_{i}$ have normal distributions. When $L_{i}$ are linear in the reciprocals of the variables and $M_{j}$ are linear in the variables, the $X_{i}$ have gamma or conjugate gamma distributions. When the $X_{i}$ variables are non-negative, $L_{i}$ are linear in the variables and $M_{j}$ are linear in the logarithms of the variables, the $X_{i}$ have gamma distributions. These results are proved under some conditions on the compounding coefficients for p > 1, and in the case of p = 1 with the further condition that the $X_{i}$ are identically distributed.},

The Array Factor (AF) of the proposed antenna is derived and its various parameters like directivity, Half Power Beam Width (HPBW) and Side Lobe Level (SLL) are calculated by varying the size of the proposed antenna array. Simulations were carried out in MATLAB 2012b. The radiators are considered isotropic and hence mutual coupling effects are ignored. The proposed array shows a considerable improvement against the existing cylindrical and coaxial cylindrical arrays in terms of 3-D scanning, size, directivity, HPBW and SLL.},

	abstract="In the context of passive sources localization using antenna array, the estimation accuracy of elevation, and azimuth are related not only to the kind of estimator which is used, but also to the geometry of the considered antenna array. Although there are several available results on the linear array, and also for planar arrays, other geometries existing in the literature, such as 3D arrays, have been less studied. In this paper, we study the impact of the geometry of a family of 3D models of antenna array on the estimation performance of elevation, and azimuth. The Cram{\'e}r-Rao Bound (CRB), which is widely spread in signal processing to characterize the estimation performance will be used here as a useful tool to find the optimal configuration. In particular, we give closed-form expressions of CRB for a 3D antenna array under both conditional, and unconditional observation models. Thanks to these explicit expressions, the impact of the third dimension to the estimation performance is analyzed. Particularly, we give criterions to design an isotropic 3D array depending on the considered observation model. Several 3D particular geometry antennas made from uniform linear array (ULA) are analyzed, and compared with 2D antenna arrays. The isotropy condition of such arrays is analyzed. The presented framework can be used for further studies of other types of arrays.",

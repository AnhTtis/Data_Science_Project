\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, we introduce a cost aggregation framework for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, aggregating the cosine-similarity scores between image and text embeddings of CLIP. Through our \ours framework, we fine-tune the encoders of CLIP for its adaptation for the downstream task of segmentation. Our method surpasses the previous state-of-the-art in standard benchmarks and also in scenarios with a vast domain difference. The success in diverse domains underscores the promise and potential of our cost aggregation framework in advancing the field of open-vocabulary semantic segmentation.\\

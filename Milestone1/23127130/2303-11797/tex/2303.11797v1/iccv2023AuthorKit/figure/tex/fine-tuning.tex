    \caption{\textbf{Illustration of the proposed fine-tuning approach.} To fine-tune the CLIP image encoder, we optimize the attention layers and position embeddings exclusively. This approach not only improves efficiency but also enhances performance. Here, $N$ refers to the number of layers in the CLIP image encoder.}

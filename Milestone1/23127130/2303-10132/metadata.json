    "abstract": "Ovadia and Rodriguez-Hertz (Neutralized local entropy, arXiv:2302.10874) defined the neutralized Bowen open ball for an autonomous dynamical system on a compact metric space. Replacing the usual Bowen open ball with neutralized Bowen open ball, we introduce the notions of neutralized Bowen topological entropy of subsets, neutralized weighted Bowen topological entropy of subsets, lower neutralized Brin-Katok's local entropy of Borel probability measures, and neutralized Katok's entropy of Borel probability measures for a non-autonomous dynamical system on a compact metric space. Then, we establish variational principles for neutralized Bowen topological entropy and neutralized weighted Bowen topological entropy of non-empty compact subsets in terms of lower neutralized Brin-Katok's local entropy and neutralized Katok's entropy. In particular, this extends the main result of (YANG, R., CHEN, E., ZHOU, X.: Variational principle for neutralized Bowen topological entropy, arXiv:2303.01738v1) for autonomous dynamical systems.",

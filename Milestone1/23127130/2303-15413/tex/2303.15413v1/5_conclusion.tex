\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we formulate and identify the sources of the Janus problem in zero-shot text-to-3D generation. In this light, we argue that debiasing the prompts and raw 2D scores is essential for the realistic generation. Therefore, we propose two methods that increase the quality and are applicable to existing frameworks with little overhead without 3D supervision, showing potential for future research in this promising area.

Dark matter is five times more abundant than ordinary visible matter in our Universe. While laboratory searches hunting for dark matter have traditionally focused on the electroweak scale, theories of low mass hidden sectors motivate new detection techniques. Extending these searches to lower mass ranges, well below 1 GeV/c2, poses new challenges as rare interactions with standard model matter transfer progressively less energy to electrons and nuclei in detectors. Here, we propose an approach based on phonon-assisted quantum evaporation combined with quantum sensors for detection of desorption events via tracking of spin coherence. The intent of our proposed dark matter sensors is to extend the parameter space to energy transfers in rare interactions to as low as a few meV for detection of dark matter particles in the keV/c2 mass range.

In this work we focus on calcium tungstate as target material.

In addition, we investigate the sensitivities of future direct dark matter searches using CRESST-II like detectors. Extending previous works we take into account achievable energy resolutions and thresholds as well as beta and gamma backgrounds for this investigation. We show that an exploration of WIMP-nucleon cross sections below the neutrino floor is possible for exposures of 10 kg-years or higher.

We use this information to calculate the maximum value of the so-called neutrino floor for direct dark matter detection experiments, which determines when these detectors are sensitive to the neutrino background. After including all relevant experimental constraints in different simplified neutrino models, we have found that the neutrino floor can increase by various orders of magnitude in the region of dark matter masses below 10 GeV in the case of scalar mediators, however, this spectacular enhancement is subject to the re-examination of supernovae bounds. The increase is approximately a factor of two for vector mediators.

 abstract={The paper presents a new approach to the description of the nonrelativistic weak
interaction of a massive neutral particle (lepton) and a nucleus, in which the latter retains
its integrity. The cross section of such a process is a sum of the elastic (or coherent)
contribution, when the nucleus remains in its original state and inelastic (incoherent)
contribution, when the nucleus is in an excited state. Smooth transition from elastic
scattering to inelastic scattering is regulated by the dependence of nuclear nucleon
form factors from the momentum transferred to the nucleus. The intensity of the weak
interaction is given by the parameters that determine the contributions to the probability
amplitude of the scalar products of lepton and nucleon currents.
The resulting expressions are of interest, at least in the problem of direct detection
of neutral massive weakly interacting particles of dark matter, since, in contrast to the
generally accepted approach both elastic and inelastic processes are taken into account
simultaneously. It is shown that the presence of an inelastic contribution accompanied by
the emission of a characteristic radiation (photons) from the de-excitation of the nucleus,
turns out to be decisive, when the coherent cross section is strongly suppressed or cannot
be registered. The first case takes place due to the proximity to zero of the corresponding
interaction constant or if the momentum transferred to the nucleus is too great and the
coherence condition is not met. When the measurable recoil energy of the nucleus is
below the registration threshold, the coherent cross section cannot be seen at all. In such
a situation, these ”inelastic” photons represent the only available signal of the dark matter
particles interaction with matter.
Therefore, in order to extract maximum information about the dark matter particles
one should plan experiments aimed at the direct detection of dark matter particles in such
a setting, when it is possible to register both the recoil energy of the nucleus and the
gamma-quanta from the de-excitation of the nucleus.},

 abstract={Observation of coherent neutrino–nucleus scattering in the COHERENT experiment opens a source of new information for basic research in neutrino and nuclear physics and for searches for physics beyond the Standard Model. Due to considerable transfer momenta, a characteristic feature of the kinematic region of this experiment is that the coherence effect in this region is not “pure” but “mixed” with a noticeable incoherent contribution. On the one hand, this leads to additional systematic uncertainties in the study of the “neutrino component” of the coherence effect itself; on the other hand, this allows investigation of the dynamic transition between the coherent and incoherent scattering regimes and potential experimental discrimination between them. Consistent measurement of the coherent and incoherent (anti)neutrino–nucleus scattering cross sections in the same experiment is, to our mind, a unique possibility of getting a source of new data for neutrino physics, nuclear physics, and new physics.  In this work it is shown that this is possible not only in accelerator-based experiments on the study of coherent neutrino and antineutrino scattering by various nuclei, where the neutrino energy amounts to hundreds of MeV, but also in reactor experiments, where the antineutrino energy is below 10 MeV. This estimation is based on the approach that quantitatively controls the “smooth transition” of the (anti)neutrino–nucleus scattering cross section from the coherent (elastic) to the incoherent (inelastic) regime. In the former case, the nucleus remains in the initial quantum state, and in the latter case, the quantum state of the target nucleus changes. Observation of a certain number of photons with a rather high energy deexciting the nucleus after inelastic interaction with an (anti)neutrino is proposed to be used as a signal of this inelastic process. The upper estimate of the number of these photons is obtained.

abstract={Neutrino-nucleus scattering $\nu A\to \nu A$, in which the nucleus conserves its integrity, is considered. Our consideration follows a microscopic description of the nucleus as a bound state of its constituent nucleons described by a multi-particle wave-function of a general form. We  show  that elastic interactions keeping the nucleus in the same quantum state lead to a quadratic enhancement of the corresponding cross-section in terms of the number of nucleons.
Meanwhile, the cross-section of inelastic processes in which the quantum state of the nucleus is changed, essentially has a linear dependence on the number of nucleons.
These two classes of processes are referred to as coherent and incoherent, respectively.
Accounting for all possible  initial and final internal states of the nucleus leads to a general conclusion independent of the nuclear model.
The coherent and incoherent cross-sections are driven by factors $|F_{p/n}|^2$ and $(1-|F_{p/n}|^2)$, where $|F_{p/n}|^2$ is a proton/neutron form-factor of the nucleus, averaged over its initial states.
Therefore, our assessment suggests a smooth transition between regimes of coherent and incoherent neutrino-nucleus scattering.
In general, both  regimes contribute to experimental observables.
The coherent cross-section formula used in the literature is revised and corrections depending on kinematics are estimated.
Consideration of only those matrix elements  which correspond to the same initial and final  spin states of the nucleus and accounting for a non-zero momentum of the target nucleon are two main sources of the corrections.
As an illustration of the importance of the incoherent channel we considered three experimental setups with different nuclei.
As an  example, for ${}^{133}\text{Cs}$ and neutrino energies of $30-50$ MeV the incoherent cross-section is about 10-20\% of the coherent contribution if experimental detection threshold is accounted for.
Experiments attempting to measure coherent neutrino scattering by solely detecting the recoiling nucleus, as is typical, might be including an incoherent background that is indistinguishable from the signal if the excitation gamma eludes its detection. 
However, as is shown here, the incoherent component can be measured directly by searching for photons released by the excited nuclei inherent to the incoherent channel.
For a beam experiment these gammas should be correlated in time with the beam, and their higher energies make the corresponding signal easily detectable at a rate governed by the ratio of incoherent to coherent cross-sections.
The detection of signals due to the nuclear recoil and excitation $\gamma$s provides a more sensitive instrument in studies of nuclear structure and possible signs of new physics.},

 abstract={Neutrino-nucleus $\nu A\to \nu A$ and antineutrino-nucleus $\bar\nu A\to \bar\nu A$ interactions, when the nucleus conserves its integrity, are discussed with coherent (elastic) and incoherent (inelastic) scattering regimes taken into account.
In the first regime the nucleus remains in the same quantum state after the scattering and the cross-section depends on the quadratic number of nucleons. 
In the second regime the nucleus changes its quantum state and the cross-section has an essentially linear dependence on the number of nucleons. 
The coherent and incoherent cross-sections are driven by a nuclear nucleon 
form-factor squared $|F|^2$ term and a $(1-|F|^2)$ term, respectively. 
One has a smooth transition between the regimes of coherent and incoherent (anti)neutrino-nucleus scattering. 
Due to the neutral current nature these elastic and inelastic  processes are indistinguishable if the nucleus recoil energy is only observed. 
One way to separate the 
coherent signal from the incoherent one is to register $\gamma$ quanta
from deexcitation of the nucleus excited during the incoherent scattering. 
Another way is to use a very low-energy threshold detector and collect data at very low recoil energies, where the incoherent scattering is vanishingly small.
In particular, for ${}^{133}\text{Cs}$ and neutrino energies of 30--50 MeV the incoherent cross-section is about 15-20\% of the coherent one. 
Therefore, the COHERENT experiment (with ${}^{133}\text{Cs}$) has measured  
the coherent elastic neutrino nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS)
with the inelastic admixture at a level of 15-20\%, if the excitation $\gamma$ quantum escapes its detection.  },

From these considerations it follows that one is unable to prove, especially model-independently,a discovery of a DM particle with an accelerator, or collider. One can only obtain evidence on existence of a weakly interacting neutral particle, which could be, or could not be the DM candidate. The current LHC DM search program uses only the missing transverse energy signature. Non-observation of any excess above Standard Model expectations forces the LHC experiments to enter into the same fighting for the best exclusion curve, in which (almost) all direct and indirect DM search experiments permanently take place. But this fighting has very little (almost nothing) to do with a real possibility of discovering a DM particle. The true DM particles possess an exclusive galactic signature --- annual modulation of a signal, which is accessible today only for direct DM detection experiments. There is no way for it with a collider, or accelerator. Therefore to prove the DM nature of a collider-discovered candidate one must find the candidate in a direct DM experiment and demonstrate the galactic signature for the candidate. Furthermore, being observed, the DM particle must be implemented into a modern theoretical framework. The best candidate is the supersymmetry, which looks today inevitable for coherent interpretation of all available DM data.},

The COHERENT collaboration reported the first detection of CEvNS [Akimov:2017ade] using a CsI[Na] detector. At present the collaboration is deploying four detector technologies: a CsI[Na] scintillating crystal, p-type point-contact germanium detectors, single-phase liquid argon, and NaI[Tl] crystals. All detectors are located in the neutron-quiet basement of the SNS target building at distances 20-30 m from the SNS neutrino source. The simultaneous measurement in all four COHERENT detector subsystems will test the N2 dependence of the cross section and search for new physics. In addition, COHERENT is measuring neutrino-induced neutrons from charged- and neutral-current neutrino interactions on nuclei in shielding materials, which represent a non-negligible background for CEvNS as well as being of intrinsic interest. The Collaboration is planning as well to look for charged-current interactions of relevance to supernova and weak-interaction physics. This document describes concisely the COHERENT physics motivations, sensitivity, and next plans for measurements at the SNS to be accomplished on a few-year timescale.},

abstract={Angular Sensitivity can provide a key additional tool which might allow unambiguous separation of a signal due to Galactic halo WIMPs from other possible backgrounds in direct detectors. We provide a formalism which allows a calculation of the expected angular distribution of events in terrestrial detectors with angular sensitivity for any incident distribution of Galactic halo dark matter. This can be used as an input when studying the sensitivity of specific detectors to halo WIMPs. We utilize this formalism to examine the expected signature for WIMP dark matter using a variety of existing analytic halo models in order to explore how uncertainty in the Galactic halo distribution impact on the the event rates that may be required to separate a possible WIMP signal from other terrestrial backgrounds. We find that as few as 30 events might be required to disentangle the signal from backgrounds if the WIMP distribution resembles an isothermal sphere distribution. On the other hand, for certain halo distributions, even detectors with fine scale resolution may require in excess of a 100-400 events to distinguish a WIMP signal from backgrounds using angular sensitivity. We also note that for finite thresholds the different energy dependence of spin-dependent scattering cross sections may require a greater number of events to discern a WIMP signal than for spin independent interactions. Finally, we briefly describe ongoing studies aimed at developing strategies to better exploit angular signatures, and the use of N-body simulations to better model the expected halo distribution in predicting the expected signature for direct WIMP detectors.}

The signature for elastic scattering of WIMPs on nuclear targets involves the observation of what is essentially 
excess noise in the detector. Thus, in order to definitively establish a positive detection, one has to convincingly demonstrate that this excess noise is indeed WIMP induced, and not due to some unexpected  terrestrial background.  
	The signature focussed on by the DAMA collaboration, an annual modulation due to the Earth's orbital motion through the WIMP halo, is  problematic in this regard.  In the first place, the effect is small, at the few percent level at best, in addition, numerous radioactive backgrounds  are known to modulate over the course of a year.
	The Earth's motion around the Sun, combined with the Sun's motion around the Galactic disk, can however provide another, much larger and more unambiguous signature.  If detectors can be developed that are sensitive to the direction of recoil of the nucleus impacted by a WIMP, then the expected signal will have an angular dependence characteristic of this velocity relative to the incident  WIMP halo phase space distribution.

When combined with the wealth of observational evidence for a nonrelativistic 
matter density 00.3, the big-bang-nucleosynthesis constraint on the 
baryon density, b0.1 indicates the existence of a significant amount of 
nonbaryonic dark matter. 
Several lines of reasoning suggest that the dark matter consists of some new, 
as yet undiscovered, weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP). 
Of the WIMP candidates that have been considered, perhaps the best-motivated 
and certainly the most theoretically developed is the neutralino, 
the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) in many supersymmetric theories. 
There is now a vast experimental effort being mounted to detect these 
particles in the Galactic halo. 
Techniques include direct detection in low-background laboratory detectors,
indirect detection through observation of energetic neutrinos 
from annihilation of WIMPs that have accumulated in the Sun and/or the
Earth, and observation of anomalous cosmic-ray antiprotons, 
positrons, and gamma rays.

There is almost universal agreement among astronomers that most of the mass 
in the Universe and most of the mass in the Galactic halo is dark. 
Many lines of reasoning suggest that the dark matter consists of some new, 
as yet undiscovered, weakly-interacting massive particle (WIMP). 
There is now a vast experimental effort being surmounted to detect WIMPS
in the halo. 
The most promising techniques involve direct detection in low-background 
laboratory detectors and indirect detection through observation of 
energetic neutrinos from annihilation of WIMPs that have accumulated 
in the Sun and/or the Earth. 
Of the many WIMP candidates, perhaps the best motivated and certainly 
the most theoretically developed is the neutralino, the lightest 
superpartner in many supersymmetric theories. 
We review the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model and 
discuss prospects for detection of neutralino dark matter. 
We review in detail how to calculate the cosmological abundance of the 
neutralino and the event rates for both direct- and indirect-detection 
schemes, and we discuss astrophysical and laboratory constraints on 
supersymmetric models. 
We isolate and clarify the uncertainties from particle physics, 
nuclear physics, and astrophysics that enter at each step in the calculation. 
We briefly review other related 
dark-matter candidates and detection techniques.

There is increasing interest in the possibility of setting up terrestrial 
experiments for the direct detection of galactic dark matter on the 
hypothesis that this may consist of new types of elementary particle. 
The past two years have seen an increased level of development work 
directed towards dark matter detectors for several types of candidate
particle. 
Existing low background detectors have set some limits on certain 
types of dark matter particle and a number of new experiments are 
now planned which will be capable of improving these limits.

This review discusses the principal particle candidates for the galactic 
dark matter, and summarizes the various experimental ideas which have 
been proposed for their detection, in particular electromagnetic 
detectors for light axions and nuclear recoil detectors for heavy 
neutral particles. 
For the latter, a variety of low temperature and ionization techniques 
are being studied. 
Progress in the development of each of these is summarized, together with
prospects and plans for specific experiments in the near future.

The differential cross-section for the elastic scattering of the lightest 
supersymmetric particle (LSP) with nuclear targets is calculated in the
context of currently fashionable supersymmetric theories (SUSY). 
An effective four fermion interaction is constructed by considering 
i) $Z^0$ exchange ii)s-quark exchange and iii) Higgs exchange. 
It is expressed in terms of the form factors 
$f^0_V,f^0_A, f^0_S$ (isoscalar) and $f^1_V,f^1_A$ and $f^1_S$ (isovector) 
which contain all the information of the underlining theory. 
Numerical values were obtained using representative input parameters 
in the constrained parameter space of SUSY phenomenology. 
Both the coherent and for odd-A nuclei the incoherent (spin) nuclear 
matrix elements were evaluated for nuclei of experimental interest. 
The spin matrix elements tend to dominate for odd nuclei but the 
coherent matrix elements become more important in all other cases. 
For the coherent part the Higgs contribution competes with the Z- and s-quark 
contributions. 
Cross-sections as high as $10^{-34} cm^2$ have been obtained.

If weakly interacting massive particles (WIMP's) are the dark matter in the galactic halo, they may be detected in low-background ionization detectors now operating or with low-temperature devices under development. In detecting WIMP's of low mass or WIMP's with spin-dependent nuclear interactions (e.g., photinos), a principal technical difficulty appears to be achieving very low thresholds ( <~ keV) in large (~ kg) detectors with low background noise. We present an analytic treatment of WIMP detection and show that the seasonal modulation of the signal can be used to detect WIMP's even at low-signal-to-background levels and thus without the necessity of going to very-low-energy thresholds. As a result, the prospects for detecting a variety of cold-dark-matter candidates may be closer at hand than previously thought. We discuss in detail the detector characteristics required for a number of WIMP candidates, and carefully work out expected event rates for several present and proposed detectors.

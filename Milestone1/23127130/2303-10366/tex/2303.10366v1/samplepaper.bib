abstract = {From an engineering point of view, the problem of coordinating a set of autonomous, mobile robots for the purpose of cooperatively performing a task has been studied extensively over the past decade. In contrast, in this paper we aim to understand the fundamental algorithmic limitations on what a set of autonomous mobile robots can or cannot achieve. We therefore study a hard task for a set of weak robots. The task is for the robots in the plane to form any arbitrary pattern that is given in advance. This task is fundamental in the sense that if the robots can form any pattern, they can agree on their respective roles in a subsequent, coordinated action. The robots are weak in several aspects. They are anonymous; they cannot explicitly communicate with each other, but only observe the positions of the others; they cannot remember the past; they operate in a very strong form of asynchronicity. We show that the tasks that such a system of robots can perform depend strongly on their common agreement about their environment, i.e. the readings of their environment sensors. If the robots have no common agreement about their environment, they cannot form an arbitrary pattern. If each robot has a compass needle that indicates North (the robot world is a flat surface, and compass needles are parallel), then any odd number of robots can form an arbitrary pattern, but an even number cannot (in the worst case). If each robot has two independent compass needles, say North and East, then any set of robots can form any pattern.}

abstract="We propose a new probabilistic pattern formation algorithm for oblivious mobile robots that operates in the ASYNC model. Unlike previous work, our algorithm makes no assumptions about the local coordinate systems of robots (the robots do not share a common ``North'' nor a common ``Right''), yet it preserves the ability from any initial configuration that contains at least 5 robots to form any general pattern (and not just patterns that satisfy symmetricity predicates). Our proposal also gets rid of the previous assumption (in the same model) that robots do not pause while moving (so, our robots really are fully asynchronous), and the amount of randomness is kept low -- a single random bit per robot per Look-Compute-Move cycle is used. Our protocol consists in the combination of two phases, a probabilistic leader election phase, and a deterministic pattern formation one. As the deterministic phase does not use chirality, it may be of independent interest in the deterministic context. A noteworthy feature of our algorithm is the ability to form patterns with multiplicity points (except the gathering case due to impossibility results), a new feature in the context of pattern formation that we believe is an important asset of our approach.",

abstract = {Given a set R of robots, each one located at a different vertex of an infinite regular tessellation graph, we aim to explore the Arbitrary Pattern Formation (APF) problem. Given a multiset F of grid vertices such that |R|=|F|, APF asks for a distributed algorithm that moves robots so as to reach a configuration similar to F. Similarity means that robots must be disposed as F regardless of translations, rotations, reflections. So far, as possible graph discretizing the Euclidean plane only the standard square grid has been considered in the context of the classical OBLOT model. However, it is natural to consider also the other regular tessellation graphs, that are triangular and hexagonal grids. In particular, the former can be considered as the most general in terms of possible symmetries and trajectories. We provide a resolution algorithm for APF when the initial configuration is asymmetric and the considered topology is any regular tessellation graph. The algorithm and its correctness are based on a rigorous methodology.}

abstract = {The Arbitrary Pattern Formation problem asks for a distributed algorithm that moves a set of autonomous mobile robots to form any arbitrary pattern given as input. The robots are assumed to be autonomous, anonymous and identical. They operate in Look-Compute-Move cycles under an asynchronous scheduler. The robots do not have access to any global coordinate system. The movement of the robots is assumed to be rigid, which means that each robot is able to reach its desired destination without interruption. The existing literature that investigates this problem, considers robots with unobstructed visibility. This work considers the problem in the more realistic obstructed visibility model, where the view of a robot can be obstructed by the presence of other robots. The robots are assumed to be punctiform and equipped with visible lights that can assume a constant number of predefined colors. We have studied the problem in two settings based on the level of consistency among the local coordinate systems of the robots: two axis agreement (they agree on the direction and orientation of both coordinate axes) and one axis agreement (they agree on the direction and orientation of only one coordinate axis). In both settings, we have provided a full characterization of initial configurations from where any arbitrary pattern can be formed.}

abstract = {In a system in which anonymous mobile robots repeatedly execute a “Look–Compute–Move” cycle, a robot is said to be oblivious if it has no memory to store its observations in the past, and hence its move depends only on the current observation. This paper considers the pattern formation problem in such a system, and shows that oblivious robots can form any pattern that non-oblivious robots can form, except that two oblivious robots cannot form a point while two non-oblivious robots can. Therefore, memory does not help in forming a pattern, except for the case in which two robots attempt to form a point. Related results on the pattern convergence problem are also presented.}

\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we proposed a novel dialogue-to-video retrieval model which incorporates conversational information from dialogue-based queries. Experimental results on the AVSD benchmark dataset show that our approach with a plain-text query outperforms previous state-of-the-art models. Moreover, our model using dialogue as a search query yields further improvements in retrieval performance, demonstrating the importance of utilising dialogue information.

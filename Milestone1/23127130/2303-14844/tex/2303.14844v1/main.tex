\section{Limitations and Outlook}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In the setting of $m>1$, the proof of the linear convergence of QNN
training (Section~\ref{sec:theory-fast}) relies on the convergence of the
asymptotic QNN dynamics as a premise. Given our empirical results, an interesting future direction might be to rigorously characterize
the condition for the convergence of the asymptotic dynamics. Also we mainly consider (variants of) two-outcome measurements $\qnnmeasure$ with two
eigensubspaces. It might be interesting to look into measurements with more
complicated spectrums and see how the shapes of the spectrums affect the rates
of convergence.

A QNN for learning a classical dataset is composed of three parts: a classical-to-quantum
encoder, a quantum classifier and a readout measurement. Here we have mainly
focused on the stage after encoding, i.e. training a QNN classifier to
manipulate the density matrices containing classical information that are
potentially too costly for a classically-implemented linear model. Our analysis
highlights the necessity for measurement design, assuming the design of the
quantum classifier mixes to the full $d\times d$ special unitary group. Our
result can be combined with existing techniques of classifier designs (i.e.
ansatz design) (\cite{ragone2022representation, larocca2021theory, wang2022symmetric,ourvqe2022}) by
engineering the invariant subspaces, or be combined with encoder designs
explored in \citep{huang2021power,du2022demystify}.

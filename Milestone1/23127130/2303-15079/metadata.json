    "abstract": "Let $Ω=Ω_0\\setminus \\overlineΘ\\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$, $n\\geq 2$, where $Ω_0$ and $Θ$ are two open, bounded and convex sets such that $\\overlineΘ\\subset Ω_0$ and let $β<0$ be a given parameter. We consider the eigenvalue problem for the Laplace operator associated to $Ω$, with Robin boundary condition on $\\partial Ω_0$ and Neumann boundary condition on $\\partial Θ$. In [Paoli-Piscitelli-Trani, ESAIM-COCV '20] it is proved that the spherical shell is the only maximizer for the first Robin-Neumann eigenvalue in the class of domains $Ω$ with fixed outer perimeter and volume.\n  We establish a quantitative version of the afore-mentioned isoperimetric inequality; the main novelty consists in the introduction of a new type of hybrid asymmetry, that turns out to be the suitable one to treat the different conditions on the outer and internal boundary. Up to our knowledge, in this context, this is the first stability result in which both the outer and the inner boundary are perturbed.",

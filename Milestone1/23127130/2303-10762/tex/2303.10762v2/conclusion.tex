\section{Conclusions and Future Work}\label{sec:conclusion}

This work focuses on detecting synthetic images generated by CNNs. We have demonstrated that image artifacts are inherent in CNN's inductive bias and utilized this notion to propose a new method called DIF, which extracts fingerprints from generated images to detect images from the same model or its fine-tuned variant. Our method achieves detection accuracy on par with or better than the current state-of-the-art generated image detectors, while requiring a very small number (up to 512) of generated images.

However, we identified several phenomena that require further investigation. Some image generators produce weak fingerprints, which are challenging for our proposed method, despite the proposed modifications. Furthermore, the method performs poorly on certain compression methods and blurred images.We believe that the effect of compression on fingerprint extraction and detection requires additional attention and is a topic for future research.

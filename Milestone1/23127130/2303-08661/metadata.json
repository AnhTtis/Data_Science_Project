    "abstract": "Geometrical frustration and the enhancement of strong quantum fluctuations in two-dimensional triangular antiferromagnets can lead to various intriguing phenomena. Here, we studied the spin-1/2 triangular lattice antiferromagnet NdAuAl$_4$Ge$_2$. Thermodynamic and transport properties, such as magnetization and specific heat together with the resistivity measurements were performed. In zero field, two successive phase transitions were observed at $T_{\\rm N1}=1.75\\pm 0.02$ K and $T_{\\rm N2}=0.49\\pm 0.02$ K, respectively. Under magnetic field, $\\rm XXZ$-type anisotropy was revealed, with the moments pointing along the easy $c$ axis. For $B\\parallel c$, multiple field-induced states were observed, and the magnetic phase diagram was established based on the specific heat and magnetization data. The temperature-dependent resistivity measurements indicate that NdAuAl$_4$Ge$_2$ is a good metal. It is very likely that both the long-range RKKY interactions and the geometrical frustration play an important roles in this case.",

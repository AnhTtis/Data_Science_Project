    "abstract": "We show that the recent experimental data on the cross section of the process $e^{+}e^{-}\\toΛ\\barΛ$ near the threshold can be perfectly explained by the final-state interaction of $Λ$ and $\\barΛ$. The enhancement of the cross section is related to the existence of low-energy real or virtual state in the corresponding potential. We present a simple analytical formula that fits the experimental data very well.",

    "abstract": "We have proved that if the function $\\operatorname{P_v}(G)$, measuring the proportion of the elements of a finite group $G$ that are zeros of irreducible characters of $G$, is less than $¶{A_7}$, then $\\operatorname{P_v}(G)\\in \\{ \\frac{m-1}{m}\\mid m=1,2,\\cdots ,6 \\}$. In this paper, we give a classification of finite groups $G$ such that $\\operatorname{P_v}(G)=\\frac{m-1}{m}$ for $m=1,2,\\cdots ,6$.",

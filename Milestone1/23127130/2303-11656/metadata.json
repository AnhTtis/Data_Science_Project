    "abstract": "This article deals with a relationship between derived categories of  modules over some partially ordered sets and hypothetical  triangulated categories arising from quasi-homogeneous isolated  singularities. It produces heuristics for the existence of derived  equivalences between posets, using the geometric category as a  phantom intermediate. The notion of Weight plays a central role as a  simple footprint of the derived categories under consideration.",

    "abstract": "Let $X$ be a compact connected Riemann surface of genus $g$, with $g\\, \\geq\\,2$, and let $ξ$ be a holomorphic line bundle on $X$ with $ξ^{\\otimes 2}\\,=\\, {\\mathcal O}_X$. Fix a theta characteristic $\\mathbb L$ on $X$. Let ${\\mathcal M}_X(r,ξ)$ be the moduli space of stable vector bundles $E$ on $X$ of rank $r$ such that $\\bigwedge^r E\\,=\\, ξ$ and $H^0(X,\\, E\\otimes{\\mathbb L})\\,=\\, 0$. Consider the quotient of ${\\mathcal M}_X(r,ξ)$ by the involution given by $E\\, \\longmapsto\\, E^*$. We construct an algebraic morphism from this quotient to the moduli space of ${\\rm SL}(r,{\\mathbb C})$ opers on $X$. Since $\\dim {\\mathcal M}_X(r,ξ)$ coincides with the dimension of the moduli space of ${\\rm SL}(r,{\\mathbb C})$ opers, it is natural to ask about the injectivity and surjectivity of this map.",

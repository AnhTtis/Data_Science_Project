\section{Conclusion}
This paper proposed \netname{}, a depth super-resolution network, which includes a high-frequency extraction branch (HFEB) and a guided depth restoration branch (GDRB). Specifically, implemented as an efficient transformer, HFEB extracts explicit HF features. Then, GDRB deploys a two-stage encoder-decoder network to recover HR depth maps progressively, by adaptively fusing discriminative features while supplementing additional, implicit HF information. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate that \netname{} sets a new state-of-the-art for guided depth super-resolution.

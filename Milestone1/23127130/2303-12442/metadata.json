    "abstract": "The Letter studies the unoccupied states of Tl/Si(111) by spin-resolved inverse photoemission (IPES) using a rotatable electron source. Authors claim that the spin polarization rotates from an in-plane Rashba polarization at $Γ$ to the surface normal at K(K') valleys. This Comment first indicates that the in-plane polarization does not vanish at the valleys despite the claims and the data representation. Second, it highlights that the out-of-plane polarization cannot be straightforwardly measured. Hypothesis and/or unspecified data treatment are needed to experimentally conclude on the polarization rotation and the completely out-of-plane spin-polarized valleys.",

    "abstract": "In many applications, one is interested in the shape of an object, like the contour of a bone or the trajectory of joints of a tennis player, irrespective of the way these shapes are parameterized. However for analysis of these shape spaces, it is sometimes useful to have a parameterization at hand, in particular if one is interested in deforming shapes. The purpose of the paper is to examine three different methods that one can follow to endow shape spaces with a Riemannian metric that is measuring deformations in a parameterization independent way.",

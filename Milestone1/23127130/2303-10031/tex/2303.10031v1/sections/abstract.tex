We derive direct data-driven dissipativity analysis methods for Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) systems using a single sequence of input-scheduling-output data~--~the data-dictionary. By means of constructing a semi-definite program subject to linear matrix inequality constraints from the data-dictionary, direct data-driven verification of $(Q,S,R)$-type of dissipativity properties of the LPV system is achieved. Multiple computationally efficient implementation methods are proposed that can even exploit structural information on the scheduling, e.g., rate bounds. The effectiveness of the proposed methodologies is demonstrated on two academic examples.

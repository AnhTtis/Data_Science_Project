    "abstract": "The performance of a Collaborative Filtering (CF) method is based on the properties of a User-Item Rating Matrix (URM). And the properties or Rating Data Characteristics (RDC) of a URM are constantly changing. Recent studies significantly explained the variation in the performances of CF methods resulted due to the change in URM using six or more RDC. Here, we found that the significant proportion of variation in the performances of different CF techniques can be accounted to two RDC only. The two RDC are the number of ratings per user or Information per User (IpU) and the number of ratings per item or Information per Item (IpI). And the performances of CF algorithms are quadratic to IpU (or IpI) for a square URM. The findings of this study are based on seven well-established CF methods and three popular public recommender datasets: 1M MovieLens, 25M MovieLens, and Yahoo! Music Rating datasets",

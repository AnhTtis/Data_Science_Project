  abstract = {A novel algorithm for computing the action of a matrix exponential over a vector is proposed. The algorithm is based on a multilevel Monte Carlo method, and the vector solution is computed probabilistically generating suitable random paths which evolve through the indices of the matrix according to a suitable probability law. The computational complexity is proved in this paper to be significantly better than the classical Monte Carlo method, which allows the computation of much more accurate solutions. Furthermore, the positive features of the algorithm in terms of parallelism were exploited in practice to develop a highly scalable implementation capable of solving some test problems very efficiently using high performance supercomputers equipped with a large number of cores. For the specific case of shared memory architectures the performance of the algorithm was compared with the results obtained using an available Krylov-based algorithm, outperforming the latter in all benchmarks analyzed so far.},

The method is based on generating random paths, which evolve through the indices of the matrix, governed by a given continuous-time Markov chain. The vector solution is computed probabilistically by averaging over a suitable multiplicative functional. This representation extends the existing linear algebra Monte Carlo-based methods, and was used in practice to develop an efficient algorithm capable of computing both, a single entry or the full vector solution. Finally, several relevant benchmarks were executed to assess the performance of the algorithm.

  abstract = {Many real dynamic systems are better characterized using a non-integer order dynamic model based on fractional calculus or, differentiation or integration of non-integer order. Traditional calculus is based on integer order differentiation and integration. The concept of fractional calculus has tremendous potential to change the way we see, model, and control the nature around us. Denying fractional derivatives is like saying that zero, fractional, or irrational numbers do not exist. In this paper, we offer a tutorial on fractional calculus in controls. Basic definitions of fractional calculus, fractional order dynamic systems and controls are presented first. Then, fractional order PID controllers are introduced which may make fractional order controllers ubiquitous in industry. Additionally, several typical known fractional order controllers are introduced and commented. Numerical methods for simulating fractional order systems are given in detail so that a beginner can get started quickly. Discretization techniques for fractional order operators are introduced in some details too. Both digital and analog realization methods of fractional order operators are introduced. Finally, remarks on future research efforts in fractional order control are given.},

  abstract = {An algorithm for computing matrix functions is presented. It employs a Schur decomposition with reordering and blocking followed by the block form of a recurrence of Parlett, with functions of the nontrivial diagonal blocks evaluated via a Taylor series. A parameter is used to balance the conflicting requirements of producing small diagonal blocks and keeping the separations of the blocks large. The algorithm is intended primarily for functions having a Taylor series with an infinite radius of convergence, but it can be adapted for certain other functions, such as the logarithm. Novel features introduced here include a convergence test that avoids premature termination of the Taylor series evaluation and an algorithm for reordering and blocking the Schur form. Numerical experiments show that the algorithm is competitive with existing special-purpose algorithms for the matrix exponential, logarithm, and cosine. Nevertheless, the algorithm can be numerically unstable with the default choice of its blocking parameter (or in certain cases for all choices), and we explain why determining the optimal parameter appears to be a very difficult problem. A MATLAB implementation is available that is much more reliable than the function \textbackslash texttt\{funm\} in MATLAB\textasciitilde 6.5 (R13).},

This book attempts to bridge the gap between theory and practice concentrating on modern algorithmic implementation on parallel architecture machines. Although a suitable text for final year postgraduate mathematicians and computational scientists it is principally aimed at the applied scientists: only a small amount of mathematical knowledge is assumed and theorem proving is kept to a minimum, with the main focus being on parallel algorithms development often to applied industrial problems.

This disease is characterized by important damage at a multi-organ level, partially due to the abundant expression of ACE2 in practically all human tissues. However, not every organ in which ACE2 is abundant is affected by SARS-CoV-2, which suggests the existence of other multi-organ routes for transmitting the perturbations produced by the virus. We consider here diffusive processes through the protein\textendash protein interaction (PPI) network of proteins targeted by SARS-CoV-2 as an alternative route. We found a subdiffusive regime that allows the propagation of virus perturbations through the PPI network at a significant rate. By following the main subdiffusive routes across the PPI network, we identify proteins mainly expressed in the heart, cerebral cortex, thymus, testis, lymph node, kidney, among others of the organs reported to be affected by COVID-19.},

This requires the fast generation of random numbers greater or smaller than a certain value. We present a method to achieve this, and also to generate random numbers within any arbitrary interval. We demonstrate the method showing the properties of the transformation maps of the above mentioned distributions as examples of stable and geometric stable random numbers used for the stochastic solution of the space-time fractional diffusion equation.},

A standard finite difference discretization of the space derivative is initially applied which results in a linear stiff term. Then a rectangular product-integration (PI) rule is implemented in an implicit-explicit (IMEX) framework in order to implicitly treat this linear stiff term and handle in an explicit way the non-linear, and usually non-stiff, term. The kernel compression scheme (KCS) is successively adopted to reduce the overload of computation and storage need for the persistent memory term. To reduce the computational effort the semidiscretized problem is described in a matrix-form, so as to require the solution of Sylvester equations only with small matrices. Theoretical results on the accuracy, together with strategies for the optimal selection of the main parameters of the whole method, are derived and verified by means of numerical experiments carried out in two-dimensional domains. The computational advantages with respect to other approaches are also shown and some applications to the detection of pattern formation are illustrated at the end of the paper.},

For different parts of the complex plane different numerical techniques are used. In every case we provide estimates for accuracy of the computation; numerous pictures showing the behaviour of the Mittag- Leffler function for different values of the parameters and on different lines in the complex plane are included. The ideas und techniques employed in the paper can be used for numerical evaluation of other functions of the hypergeometric type. In particular, the same method with some small modifications can be applied for the Wright function which plays a very important role in the theory of partial differential equations of fractional order.},

Particular attention is devoted to the technique of Laplace transforms for treating these operators in a way accessible to applied scientists, avoiding unproductive generalities and excessive mathematical rigor. By applying this technique we shall derive the analy ical solutions of the most simple linear integral and differential equations of fractional order. We shall show the fundamental role of the Mittag-Leffler function, whose properties are reported in an ad hoc Appendix. The topics discussed here will be: (a) essentials of Riemann-Liouville fractional calculus with basic formulas of Laplace transforms, (b) Abel type integral equations of first and second kind, (c) relaxation and oscillation type differential equations of fractional order.},

  abstract = {Functions of matrices have been studied for as long as matrix algebra itself. Indeed, in his seminal A Memoir on the Theory of Matrices (1858), Cayley investigated the square root of a matrix, and it was not long before definitions of f(A) for general f were proposed by Sylvester and others. From their origin in pure mathematics, matrix functions have broadened into a subject of study in applied mathematics, with widespread applications in science and engineering. Research on matrix functions involves matrix theory, numerical analysis, approximation theory, and the development of algorithms and software, so it employs a wide range of theory and methods and promotes an appreciation of all these important topics. My first foray into f(A) was as a graduate student when I became interested in the matrix square root. I have worked on matrix functions on and off ever since. Although there is a large literature on the subject, including chapters in several books (notably Gantmacher [203, 1959], Horn and Johnson [296, 1991], Lancaster and Tismenetsky [371, 1985], and Golub and Van Loan [224, 1996]), there has not previously been a book devoted to matrix functions. I started to write this book in 2003. In the intervening period interest in matrix functions has grown significantly, with new applications appearing and the literature expanding at a fast rate, so the appearance of this book is timely. This book is a research monograph that aims to give a reasonably complete treatment of the theory of matrix functions and numerical methods for computing them, as well as an overview of applications. The theory of matrix functions is beautiful and nontrivial. I have strived for an elegant presentation with illuminating examples, emphasizing results of practical interest. I focus on three equivalent definitions of f(A), based on the Jordan canonical form, polynomial interpolation, and the Cauchy integral formula, and use all three to develop the theory. A thorough treatment is given of problem sensitivity, based on the Fr\'echet derivative. The applications described include both the well known and the more speculative or recent, and differential equations and algebraic Riccati equations underlie many of them.},

  abstract = {The convergence of Markov chain-based Monte Carlo linear solvers using the Ulamvon Neumann algorithm for a linear system of the form x = H x + b is investigated in this paper. We analyze the convergence of the Monte Carlo solver based on the original Ulam-von Neumann algorithm under the conditions that \$\textbackslash left\textbackslash | H \textbackslash right\textbackslash | {$<$} 1\$ as well as {$\rho$}(H) {$<$} 1, where {$\rho$}(H) is the spectral radius of H. We find that although the Monte Carlo solver is based on sampling the Neumann series, the convergence of Neumann series is not a sufficient condition for the convergence of the Monte Carlo solver. Actually, properties of H are not the only factors determining the convergence of the Monte Carlo solver; the underlying transition probability matrix plays an important role. An improper selection of the transition matrix may result in divergence even though the condition \$\textbackslash left\textbackslash | H \textbackslash right\textbackslash | {$<$} 1\$ holds. However, if the condition \$\textbackslash left\textbackslash | H \textbackslash right\textbackslash | {$<$} 1\$ is satisfied, we show that there always exist certain transition matrices that guarantee convergence of the Monte Carlo solver. On the other hand, if {$\rho$}(H) {$<$} 1 but \$\textbackslash left\textbackslash | H \textbackslash right\textbackslash | \textbackslash geqslant 1\$ the Monte Carlo linear solver may or may not converge. In particular, if the row sum \$\textbackslash sum\textbackslash nolimits\_\{j = 1\}\^N \{\textbackslash left| \{\{H\_\{ij\}\}\} \textbackslash right|\} {$>$} 1\$ for every row in H or, more generally, {$\rho$}(H{$^+$}) {$>$} 1, where H{$^+$} is the nonnegative matrix where \$H\_\{ij\}\^ + = \textbackslash left| \{\{H\_\{ij\}\}\} \textbackslash right|\$ we show that transition matrices leading to convergence of the Monte Carlo solver do not exist. Finally, given H and a transition matrix P, denoting the matrix H* via \$H\_\{ij\}\^* = H\_\{ij\}\^2/\{P\_\{ij\}\}\$ , we find that {$\rho$}(H*) {$<$} 1 is a necessary and sufficient condition for convergence of the Markov cnain-based Monte Carlo linear solvers using the Ulam-von Neumann algorithm.},

Next, one can consider a more general class of distributions whose ch.f.'s are positive powers of Laplace ch.f.'s. These are marginal distributions of the L\'evy process \$\$ \textbackslash left\textbackslash\{ \{Y(t),t \textbackslash geqslant 0\textbackslash left. \{\} \textbackslash right\textbackslash\}\} \textbackslash right. \$\$with independent increments, for which Y(1) has symmetric or asymmetric Laplace distribution. We term such a process the Laplace motion. Finally, one obtains a wider class of limiting distributions consisting of geometric stable laws, by allowing for infinite variance of the components in the geometric compounds (2.2.1). More generally, if the random number of components in the summation (2.2.1) is distributed according to a discrete law v on positive integers, a wider class of v-stable laws is obtained as the limiting distributions. This chapter is devoted to a discussion of all such related distributions and random variables.},

  abstract = {The fractional Laplacian in Rd, which we write as (-{$\Delta$}){$\alpha$}/2 with {$\alpha\in$}(0,2), has multiple equivalent characterizations. Moreover, in bounded domains, boundary conditions must be incorporated in these characterizations in mathematically distinct ways, and there is currently no consensus in the literature as to which definition of the fractional Laplacian in bounded domains is most appropriate for a given application. The Riesz (or integral) definition, for example, admits a nonlocal boundary condition, where the value of a function must be prescribed on the entire exterior of the domain in order to compute its fractional Laplacian. In contrast, the spectral definition requires only the standard local boundary condition. These differences, among others, lead us to ask the question: ``What is the fractional Laplacian?'' Beginning from first principles, we compare several commonly used definitions of the fractional Laplacian theoretically, through their stochastic interpretations as well as their analytical properties. Then, we present quantitative comparisons using a sample of state-of-the-art methods. We discuss recent advances on nonzero boundary conditions and present new methods to discretize such boundary value problems: radial basis function collocation (for the Riesz fractional Laplacian) and nonharmonic lifting (for the spectral fractional Laplacian). In our numerical studies, we aim to compare different definitions on bounded domains using a collection of benchmark problems. We consider the fractional Poisson equation with both zero and nonzero boundary conditions, where the fractional Laplacian is defined according to the Riesz definition, the spectral definition, the directional definition, and the horizon-based nonlocal definition. We verify the accuracy of the numerical methods used in the approximations for each operator, and we focus on identifying differences in the boundary behaviors of solutions to equations posed with these different definitions. Through our efforts, we aim to further engage the research community in open problems and assist practitioners in identifying the most appropriate definition and computational approach to use for their mathematical models in addressing anomalous transport in diverse applications.},

  abstract = {Methods based on Monte Carlo for solving linear systems have some interesting properties which make them, in many instances, preferable to classic methods. Namely, these statistical methods allow the computation of individual entries of the output, hence being able to handle problems where the size of the resulting matrix would be too large. In this paper, we propose a distributed linear algebra solver based on Monte Carlo. The proposed method is based on an algorithm that uses random walks over the system's matrix to calculate powers of this matrix, which can then be used to compute a given matrix function. Distributing the matrix over several nodes enables the handling of even larger problem instances, however it entails a communication penalty as walks may need to jump between computational nodes. We have studied different buffering strategies and provide a solution that minimizes this overhead and maximizes performance. We used our method to compute metrics of complex networks, such as node centrality and resolvent Estrada index. We present results that demonstrate the excellent scalability of our distributed implementation on very large networks, effectively providing a solution to previously unreachable problem instances.},

Although, most of the hazardous waste was traded between developed nations, a disproportionate asymmetry existed in the flow from developed to developing countries. Using a dynamical model, we simulate how waste stress propagates through the network and affects the countries. We identify 28 countries with low Environmental Performance Index that are at high risk of waste congestion. Therefore, they are at threat of improper handling and disposal of hazardous waste. We find evidence of pollution by heavy metals, by volatile organic compounds and/or by persistent organic pollutants, which are used as chemical fingerprints, due to the improper handling of waste in several of these countries.},

It has a number of important properties, including solid mathematical foundations, good time and space performance, small code size, multiple random streams, and better cryptographic properties than are typical for a general-purpose generator. The key idea is to pass the output of a fast well-understood ``medium quality'' random number generator to an efficient permutation function (a.k.a. hash function), built from composable primitives, that enhances the quality of the output. The algorithm can be applied at variety of bit sizes, including and bits (which provide - and -bit outputs, with periods of 264 and 2128). Optionally, we can provide each b-bit generator with a b-1 bit stream-selection constant, thereby providing 2b-1 random streams, which are full period and entirely distinct. An extension adds up to 2b -dimensional equidistribution for a total period of 2b2b . The construction of the permutation function and the periodextension technique are both founded on the idea of permutation functions on tuples. In its standard variants, b-bit generators use a 2b/2-to- function to produce b/2 bits of output. These functions can be designed to make it difficult for an adversary to discover the generator's internal state by examining its output, and thus make it challenging to predict. This property, coupled with the ability to easily switch between random streams, provides many of the benefits provided by cryptographically secure generators without the overheads usually associated with those generators.},

We provide comparisons with the corresponding Ziggurat procedures proposed by Marsaglia and Tsang [Marsaglia, G. and Tsang, W.W., 1984, SIAM Journal on Scientific and Statistical Computing, 5, 349\textendash 359; Marsaglia, G. and Tsang, W.W., 2000, Journal of Statistical Software, 5(8), 1\textendash 7.]. The proposed procedures maintain good precision over the entire support of the respective densities and are very easy to set up and implement. The proposed exponential procedure compares favourably with the Ziggurat procedure in terms of speed, running up to 24\% faster on some platform/compiler/uniform generator combinations tested.},

It develops a framework for the equations and numerical methods of applied mathematics. Gilbert Strang has taught this material to thousands of engineers and scientists (and many more on MIT's OpenCourseWare 18.085-6). His experience is seen in his clear explanations, wide range of examples, and teaching method. The book is solution-based and not formula-based: it integrates analysis and algorithms and MATLAB codes to explain each topic as effectively as possible. The topics include applied linear algebra and fast solvers, differential equations with finite differences and finite elements, Fourier analysis and optimization. This book also serves as a reference for the whole community of computational scientists and engineers. Supporting resources, including MATLAB codes, problem solutions and video lectures from Gilbert Strang's 18.085 courses at MIT, are provided at math.mit.edu/cse.},

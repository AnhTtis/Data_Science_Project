    "abstract": "We present a novel pipeline for learning the conditional distribution of a building roof mesh given pixels from an aerial image, under the assumption that roof geometry follows a set of regular patterns. Unlike alternative methods that require multiple images of the same object, our approach enables estimating 3D roof meshes using only a single image for predictions. The approach employs the PolyGen, a deep generative transformer architecture for 3D meshes. We apply this model in a new domain and investigate the sensitivity of the image resolution. We propose a novel metric to evaluate the performance of the inferred meshes, and our results show that the model is robust even at lower resolutions, while qualitatively producing realistic representations for out-of-distribution samples.",

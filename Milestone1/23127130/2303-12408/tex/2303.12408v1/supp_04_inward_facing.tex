\section{Inward-facing Dataset}
\input{supp_tables/inward_facing}
The spherical grid of EgoNeRF aligns nicely with outward-facing scenes, not inward-facing images of typical NeRF settings.
We optionally report results from widely-used datasets for novel view synthesis in ~\cref{tab:inward_facing}.
EgoNeRF shows comparable results in the Synthetic-NeRF dataset~\cite{mildenhall2021nerf}, which contains 8 synthetic objects.
In mip-NeRF 360 dataset~\cite{Barron_2022_CVPR}, which contains inward-facing objects but has unbounded background scenes, EgoNeRF outperforms other baselines except mip-NeRF 360.

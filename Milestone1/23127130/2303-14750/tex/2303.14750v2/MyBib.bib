It shows the form the optimization takes when using single shooting methods and collocation methods. Shooting methods solve the forward dynamics precisely, but coming up with an initial guess is difficult; collocation methods use (cubic) splines and solve the inverse dynamics problem, but the trajectories are approximate. The torque required to take a step is minimized and used as the cost function in the paper. The minimizations are done using Matlab's fmincon.},

  comment   = {This paper details a $4^\text{th}$-order spline-based parametric optimization approach to gait synthesis. It is representative of how to generate gaits using an inverse dynamics approach (e.g., given optimized spline-based trajectory in configuration space, compute needed torques). The example biped is a seven-link biped (essentially RABBIT with feet). Impacts are assumed to occur at zero velocity to supposedly avoid destabilizing effects, but in \cite{Chevallereau2009} it is pointed out that solutions are exteremly difficult to find when discontinuities, e.g., via a jump map, are introduced. For implementation purposes, this is a pretty good paper to try and rederive the results of from scratch.},

  comment   = {This paper describes its setup of a parameterized NLP using a reduced set of chosen parameters to optimize but still respecting the full dynamics of a 17-DOF robot (e.g., inverse dynamics are satisfied). The initial trajectories to follow are crafted by hand using 5th order polynomials. Impacts are forced to occur at zero velocity and no-slip/ZMP constraints are also enforced. The constraints are moved into the cost function as penalty terms and torque is also minimized. The argument in this paper is that for running on-line reductions are necessary, but existing approaches like ZMP do not hold at high walking speeds, especially for their biped. The paper does mention that derivatives can be taken by simply differentiating the recursive algorithm used to compute the inverse dynamics.},

Cubic splines are used to generate trajectories that are mapped back to the hybrid dynamics. The cost function minimized energy consumption (energy loss from heat from motors, integral of mechanical power, and impacts) based on 13 parameters, including parameters that encoded periodicity, average walking speed, and walking slope (uphill and downhill). A quasi-Newton method is used for the minimization. This paper does not include the initial guess, but does mention that smaller steps results from decreasing average velocities. The paper also has a nice, simple summary of what the ground reaction forces have to be for the stance leg not to slip or lift-off: $F_n > 0$, $|F_t| < \mu F_n$, and $L_\text{heel} F_n < M < L_\text{toe} F_n$, where $M$ is torque about ankle joint.},

  comment   = {This paper describes a standard direct collocation method for generating trajectories for bipedal robots assuming full dynamics subject to heel/toe impacts and the stance foot always flat on the ground. In addition to the dynamics, the other constraints applied are no-slip, ZMP always satisfied, impactless collisions, and joint/torque limits. The initial trajectory used to find solutions is given from a statically balanced walking gait with constraints initially relaxed. The constraints are then tightened as solutions are found. Once a solution that satisfies the original constraints are found, a natural parameter continuation is used to find new gaits over a range of step lengths. An unsubstantiated observation made is that ``convergence is greatly enhanced in the vicinity of existing solutions.''},

  comment   = {This paper gives a basic overview of numerically computing solutions to stochastic differential equations (SDE) using Monte-Carlo simulations and the Euler-Maruyama (EM) integrator. It is a basic introduction to the topic using programs in Matlab to convey concepts of numerical convergence and (linear) stability. The paper discusses these concepts using the EM integrator as its main example.

For linear SDEs, a solution is stable if $\lim \limits_{t \rightarrow \infty} X(t) = 0$. There are two definitions for measuring the linear stability of a system when it comes to the long-term behavior of the integrator as $t \rightarrow \infty$: mean-square and asymptotic stability.

Strong convergence concerns itself with the expected absolute error between a numerical approximation and the exact solution to an SDE at a fixed point in time. An integrator has a strong order of convergence equal to $\gamma$ if there exists a constant $C$ such that $\mathbb{E}|X_n - X(\tau)| \leq C \Delta t^\gamma$ for any fixed $\tau = n \Delta t \in [0, T]$. The EM integrator has strong order of convergence equal to $\frac{1}{2}$.

Weak convergence measures the absolute error between the means of numerical and actual distributions at a fixed point in time. An algorithm has a weak order of convergence equal to $\gamma$ if there exists a constant $C$ such that for all functions $p$, in some class, $\mathbb{E} p(X_n) - \mathbb{E} p(X(\tau)) \leq C \Delta t^\gamma$ at any fixed $\tau = n \Delta t \in [0, T]$. In the paper, $p$ is taken to be the identity function. For this class of functions $p$, EM has a weak order of convergence equal to 1.

In both of these definitions, $\Delta t$ needs to be sufficiently small for the inequality to hold.},

    abstract = "{We modified an irreducibly simple model of passive dynamic walking to walk on level ground, and used it to study the energetics of walking and the preferred relationship between speed and step length in humans. Powered walking was explored using an impulse applied at toe-off immediately before heel strike, and a torque applied on the stance leg. Although both methods can supply energy through mechanical work on the center of mass, the toe-off impulse is four times less costly because it decreases the collision loss at heel strike. We also studied the use of a hip torque on the swing leg that tunes its frequency but adds no propulsive energy to gait. This spring-like actuation can further reduce the collision loss at heel strike, improving walking energetics. An idealized model yields a set of simple power laws relating the toe-off impulses and effective spring constant to the speed and step length of the corresponding gait. Simulations incorporating nonlinear equations of motion and more realistic inertial parameters show that these power laws apply to more complex models as well.}",

  comment   = {This paper outlines a method for generating gaits
by solving an NLP problem and enlarging the basin of attraction of a periodic
walking motion using differential dynamic programming (DDP) of a 5-link
MABEL-like biped; unlike regular DP, DDP solutions are locally optimal. For
periodic walking, the cost function penalizes joint torques, walking speed
error, and the horizontal ground reaction force at impact. The minimization is
subject to the full hybrid dynamics of the robot as well as friction, state, and
control limits. After a periodic motion is found, DDP is used to enlarge the
basin of attraction by adding (aperiodic) trajectories that lie outside the
basin of attraction of the periodic trajectory that are stabilized with a
linearized control law about the controls applied to the periodic trajectory.
The new trajectory segment found using DDP is then added to a library of
trajectories that are tuned to converge back to the (stabilized) periodic
trajectory. This approach adds a measure of robustness to the gait.

The cost function is a little odd. The three penalized quantities are multiplied
by a decaying exponential and, in continuous time, an infinite running cost is
kept (which justifies the use of the exponential). When discretized, the use of
the exponential is less clear because the sum is finite and equal to the number
of collocation points.

The paper provides the bare minimum needed to program the NLP. The cost function
and constraints are given in symbolic form. A table lists various parameters. A
Runge-Kutta scheme is used to discretize the dynamics, Betts book is cited, but
the order of the method and whether it is an implicit or explicit method are not
specified. SNOPT is used for the walking gait optimization. The paper lacks the
initial trajectory used to find gaits and is too vague to implement as is. For
example, to help satisfy knee constraints, which for some reason appears in the
DDP section and not in the gait generation portion, it is advised to add springs
and dampers to the knees. No other piece of information is given.},

  comment   = {This survey paper covers numerical methods for solving optimal control problems. There are two main approaches to solving optimal control problems. The indirect method uses the optimality conditions of the Hamiltonian using the calculus of variations. This method requires solving a two-point boundary value problem with (in the typical case) initial conditions for state variables and terminal conditions for the adjoint variables. The other method is a direct method where the controls or the controls and state variables are approximated using basis functions. The dynamics and constraints are solved at knot points and are posed as a nonlinear programming problem at each point. Modern day approaches use direct methods because it is fast, is not as sensitive to initial conditions as indirect methods, and avoids having to derive the optimality conditions required in the indirect method (a set of nonlinear algebraic and differential equations).},

Overall, skimming the first two chapters gives a good overview of optimal control. The sense is that in practice it is better to numerically solve problems in Mayer form, but at the cost of extra variables added to the problem. It is easier to do theoretical analysis in Bolza/Lagrange form. This is based on reading a few other papers, like \cite{Westervelt2007}, and not from this paper alone.},

  comment   = {This paper addresses the importance of switching
gaits, e.g., from walking to running, in order to maintain a low cost of
transport (COT). It reports on the comparison of finding energy-efficient gaits
that minimize COT for various gaits of a two-link biped and simple quadruped.
The comparison is done between a multiple shooting method with a predetermined
sequence of steps and the direct collocation method with the sequence undefined
as proposed in \cite{Posa2013}. The models make use of series elastic actuators
(SEAs). The use of SEAs is claimed as a contribution because it represents a
middle ground between simple walking models and physical systems. The
optimizations were performed over a range of desired walking speeds. Solutions
were found using a natural parameter continuation method in desired forward
velocity (previous optimal gait was used to seed the next search). It is not
mentioned what the initial state was to bootstrap the entire process and how
close to a desired velocity the resulting gait was. Presumably all gaits are on
level ground. Otherwise, the paper appears to include enough information to
reimplement the work, but may take some effort. Another bonus is that it
explicitly states that it does not deal with stabilizing controllers. Its only
interest is effecient gait generation. Another interesting piece of information
is that the transcription introduces noise via artificial damping when using the
DC method.

The comparison is not really much of a contribution, essentially implicitly
defining footfalls is better for finding lower COT solutions than specificying
the sequence ahead of time (the plots for bipedal locomotion don't really
support the claim, but it is believable). What is interesting is that the
implicit solution is able to natrually transition between walking, grounded
running, and running when trying to keep COT low.},

  abstract = 	 {Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a promising approach for developing legged locomotion skills. However, current work commonly describes DRL as being a one-shot process, where the state, action and reward are assumed to be well defined and are directly used by an RL algorithm to obtain policies. In this paper, we describe and document an iterative design approach, which reflects the multiple design iterations of the reward that are often (if not always) needed in practice. Throughout the process, transfer learning is achieved via Deterministic Action Stochastic State (DASS) tuples, representing the deterministic policy actions associated with states visited by the stochastic policy. We demonstrate the transfer of policies learned in simulation to the physical robot without dynamics randomization. We also identify several key components that are critical for sim-to-real transfer in our setting.}

abstract = {Designers of legged robots are challenged with creating mechanisms that allow energy-efficient locomotion with robust and minimalistic control. Sources of high energy costs in legged robots include the rapid loading and high forces required to support the robot’s mass during stance and the rapid cycling of the leg’s state between stance and swing phases. Here, we demonstrate an avian-inspired robot leg design, BirdBot, that challenges the reliance on rapid feedback control for joint coordination and replaces active control with intrinsic, mechanical coupling, reminiscent of a self-engaging and disengaging clutch. A spring tendon network rapidly switches the leg’s slack segments into a loadable state at touchdown, distributes load among joints, enables rapid disengagement at toe-off through elastically stored energy, and coordinates swing leg flexion. A bistable joint mediates the spring tendon network’s disengagement at the end of stance, powered by stance phase leg angle progression. We show reduced knee-flexing torque to a 10th of what is required for a nonclutching, parallel-elastic leg design with the same kinematics, whereas spring-based compliance extends the leg in stance phase. These mechanisms enable bipedal locomotion with four robot actuators under feedforward control, with high energy efficiency. The robot offers a physical model demonstration of an avian-inspired, multiarticular elastic coupling mechanism that can achieve self-stable, robust, and economic legged locomotion with simple control and no sensory feedback. The proposed design is scalable, allowing the design of large legged robots. BirdBot demonstrates a mechanism for self-engaging and disengaging parallel elastic legs that are contact-triggered by the foot’s own lever-arm action. A multiarticular elastic coupling-decoupling mechanism enables self-stable, robust legged locomotion without sensory feedback.}}

    "abstract": "In-memory ordered key-value stores are an important building block in modern distributed applications. We present Honeycomb, a hybrid software-hardware system for accelerating read-dominated workloads on ordered key-value stores that provides linearizability for all operations including scans. Honeycomb stores a B-Tree in host memory, and executes SCAN and GET on an FPGA-based SmartNIC, and PUT, UPDATE and DELETE on the CPU. This approach enables large stores and simplifies the FPGA implementation but raises the challenge of data access and synchronization across the slow PCIe bus. We describe how Honeycomb overcomes this challenge with careful data structure design, caching, request parallelism with out-of-order request execution, wait-free read operations, and batching synchronization between the CPU and the FPGA. For read-heavy YCSB workloads, Honeycomb improves the throughput of a state-of-the-art ordered key-value store by at least 1.8x. For scan-heavy workloads inspired by cloud storage, Honeycomb improves throughput by more than 2x. The cost-performance, which is more important for large-scale deployments, is improved by at least 1.5x on these workloads.",

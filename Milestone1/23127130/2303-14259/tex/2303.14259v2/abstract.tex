In-memory ordered key-value stores are an important building block in modern distributed applications. We present     
\sys, a  hybrid software-hardware system for accelerating read-dominated workloads on ordered key-value stores that provides linearizability for all operations including scans.
\sys stores a B-Tree in host memory, and executes {\sc scan} and {\sc get} on an FPGA-based SmartNIC, 
and {\sc put}, {\sc update} and {\sc delete} on the CPU. 
This approach enables large stores and simplifies the FPGA implementation but raises the challenge of data access and synchronization across the slow PCIe bus. We describe how \sys overcomes this challenge with careful data structure design, caching, request parallelism with out-of-order request execution, wait-free read operations, and batching synchronization between the CPU and the FPGA. 
For read-heavy YCSB workloads, \sys improves the throughput of 
a state-of-the-art ordered key-value store by at least $1.8\times$.
For scan-heavy workloads inspired by cloud storage, \sys improves throughput by more than $2\times$.
The cost-performance, which is more important for large-scale deployments,
is improved by at least $1.5\times$ on these workloads. 
% For uniform workloads with inserts and more than 80\% {\sc scan} operations, \sys improves the throughput of 
% a state-of-the-art ordered key-value store
% by more than $2.3\times$. It also improves cost-performance, which is more important for large-scale deployments,
% by more than $1.9\times$.

\section{Conclusion}

In-memory ordered key-value stores are an important building block in modern distributed applications. We presented \sys, a system that leverages an FPGA-based SmartNIC to accelerate these stores with a focus on scan-dominated workloads. It stores a 
B-Tree in host memory, and executes {\sc scan} and {\sc get} operations on the FPGA, and {\sc put}, {\sc update}, and {\sc delete} operations on the CPU.
This approach enables large stores and simplifies the FPGA implementation but raises the challenge of data access and synchronization across slow PCIe. We described how \sys addresses this challenge by using large B-Tree nodes with shortcuts; caching in on-chip and on-board FPGA memory;  exploiting request-level parallelism with out-of-order execution; making {\sc scan} and {\sc get} operations wait free; and using a log in B-Tree nodes to batch synchronization across PCIe.
\sys is evalutated against a state-of-the-art ordered key-value store using both YCSB and a cloud-storage-inspired workload.
The comparison shows that \sys 
improves throughput by $1.9\times$ for uniform read-dominated workloads in YCSB and by $2.3\times$ for uniform cloud-storage-inspired workloads with more than 80\% {\sc scan} operations. Most importantly, \sys improves cost-performance, which is the key metric to optimize in large-scale data centers;  it improves throughput per watt of TDP (a proxy for TCO) by more than $1.5\times$ and $1.9\times$ for these two set of workloads respectively.

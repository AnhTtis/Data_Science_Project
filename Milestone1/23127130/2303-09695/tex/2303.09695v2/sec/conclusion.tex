\section{Conclusion}
This paper presented PersonalTailor, the first personalized 2D pattern design method supporting the user's instruction (\eg, language or sketch) for design pattern from the 3D point cloud garment. It is characterized by multi-modal panel embedding and panel-mask prediction using an encoder-decoder framework. %The multi-modal panel embeddings are first learned on cross-modal association with the local point clouds and then decoded into panel masks using transformer decoder.
%Thanks to the prompt design, our method can achieve state-of-art performance in open-set setting. 
Extensive experiments show that our method excels over existing alternatives on both standard and personalized garment pattern design settings.
%
Except fine-grained component-level ablation analysis,
a dedicated user study was also conducted, indicating the significance of our research in terms of both problem formulation and model design.

% We conduct extensive experiments to showcase our personalized pattern design ability.
% Besides, standard (non-personalized) pattern design experiments also illustrate the superiority of our approach over multiple baselines on a standard benchmark dataset under open-set settings. However, due to the domain difference between the point cloud and the prompt embeddings, our model cannot fully utilize the large-scale pre-training of vision-language models. Additionally, the current dataset has closed-set garment panels which restricts the customization ability of our network. Thus creating a generic pipeline that can incorporate such shortcomings is part of our future work.

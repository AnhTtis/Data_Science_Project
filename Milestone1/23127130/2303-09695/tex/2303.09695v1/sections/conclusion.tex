\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
This paper presented PersonalTailor, the first personalized 2D pattern fabrication method where the user can input specific constraints or demands (in language or sketch) for fabrication from the 3D point cloud garment. Our PersonalTailor is characterized by multi-modal panel embedding and panel-mask prediction using an encoder-decoder framework. %The multi-modal panel embeddings are first learned on cross-modal association with the local point clouds and then decoded into panel masks using transformer decoder.
%Thanks to the prompt design, our method can achieve state-of-art performance in open-set setting. 
We conduct extensive experiments to showcase our personalized pattern fabrication ability.
Besides, standard (non-personalized) pattern fabrication experiments also illustrate the superiority of our approach over multiple baselines on a standard benchmark dataset under open-set settings. However, due to the domain difference between the point cloud and the prompt embeddings, our model cannot fully utilize the large-scale pre-training of vision-language models. Additionally, the current dataset has closed-set garment panels which restricts the customization ability of our network. Thus creating a generic pipeline that can incorporate such shortcomings is part of our future work.

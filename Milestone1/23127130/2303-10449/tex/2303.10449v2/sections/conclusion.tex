\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
In this work, we focus on addressing the fundamental challenge of OOD detection tasks and further explore how to fully understand the semantic discrepancy between the ID/OOD samples on SCOOD benchmarks. We reveal that the key to success in the realistic SCOOD task is to allocate as many ID samples in the unlabeled set correctly as possible. To this end, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware optimal transport scheme, which introduces class-specific energy scores as guidance for effective label assignment. Experimental results show that our method achieves better performance than previous state-of-the-art methods on SCOOD benchmarks.

\textbf{Limitations.} In addition to temperature scaling, other techniques such as feature clipping applied in ReAct~\cite{sun2021react} also enhance the performance of energy score, so how to obtain an OOD score that best fits the SCOOD task can be further explored. Moreover, a setting highly related to SCOOD has been proposed in \cite{katz2022training} and formulated as a constrained optimization problem. We will also theoretically analyze these practical OOD settings in our feature work.

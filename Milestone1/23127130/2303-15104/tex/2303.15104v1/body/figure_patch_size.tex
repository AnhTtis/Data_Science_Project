    \caption{Qualitative visualization of the receptive field of local patches used in our downstream experiments on both the human and RNA datasets. The points of interest are indicated in black. The surface areas in pink represent the local receptive fields \emph{after  optimization}. We also show the corresponding voxel grids and the XYZ axes of the local reference frames.}

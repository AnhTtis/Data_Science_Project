    "abstract": "We prove that the graphs $T\\boxslash P$ have unbounded stack number and queue number $3$, where $T$ is a tree and $P$ is a path, and $\\boxslash$ denotes the graph strong product but with one of the directions removed. The previous best known results is that graphs with queue number $4$ can have unbounded stack number.",

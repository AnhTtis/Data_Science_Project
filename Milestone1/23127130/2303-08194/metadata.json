    "abstract": "Nobel laureate Wolfgang Paul showed, back in the 1950s, that charged particles can be trapped using alternating electric fields. This technique is commonly referred to as Paul traps or radiofrequency traps (RF-traps) and is used in various areas of modern physics. This paper presents a 3D-printed mechanical Paul trap, a naïve simulation of the system in Python, and student investigations. The files for the 3D-printed trap are available for download and print, and the code for the simulation is available to run and tinker with.",

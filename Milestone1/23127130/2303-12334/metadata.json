    "abstract": "We develop a method for subdividing polyhedral complexes in a way that restricts the possible recession cones and allows one to work with a fixed class of polyhedron. We use these results to construct locally finite completions of rational polyhedral complexes whose recession cones lie in a fixed fan, locally finite polytopal completions of polytopal complexes, and locally finite zonotopal completions of zonotopal complexes.",

    "abstract": "With the membership function being strictly positive, the conventional fuzzy c-means clustering method sometimes causes imbalanced influence when clusters of vastly different sizes exist. That is, an outstandingly large cluster drags to its center all the other clusters, however far they are separated. To solve this problem, we propose a hybrid fuzzy-crisp clustering algorithm based on a target function combining linear and quadratic terms of the membership function. In this algorithm, the membership of a data point to a cluster is automatically set to exactly zero if the data point is ``sufficiently'' far from the cluster center. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for hybrid fuzzy-crisp clustering along with its geometric interpretation. The algorithm is tested on twenty simulated data generated and five real-world datasets from the UCI repository and compared with conventional fuzzy and crisp clustering methods. The proposed algorithm is demonstrated to outperform the conventional methods on imbalanced datasets and can be competitive on more balanced datasets.",

    "abstract": "We consider standard-like/Froeschlé maps with a dissipation and nonlinear perturbation. That is\n  \\[ T_\\varepsilon(p,q) = \\left( (1 - γ\\varepsilon^3) p + μ+ \\varepsilon V'(q), q + (1 - γ\\varepsilon^3) p + μ+ \\varepsilon V'(q) \\mod 2 π\\right) \\]\n  where $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^D$, $q \\in 2 π\\mathbb{T}^D$ are the dynamical variables. The $μ\\in \\mathbb{R}^D, γ\\in \\mathbb{R}$ are parameters of the model. We assume that the potential $V$ is a trigonometric polynomial.\n  Note that when $γ\\ne 0$, the perturbation parameter $\\varepsilon$ creates dissipation, which has a drastic effect on the existence of quasi-periodic orbits, hence it is a singular perturbation. We fix a frequency $ω\\in \\mathbb{R}^D$ and study the existence of quasiperiodic orbits. When there is dissipation, having a quasiperiodic orbit of frequency $ω$ requires adjusting the parameter $μ$, called \\textit{the drift}.\n  We first study the Lindstedt series (formal power series in $\\varepsilon$) for quasiperidic orbits with $D$ independent frequencies and the drift when $γ\\ne 0$. We show that, when $ω$ is irrational, the series exist to all orders, and when $ω$ is Diophantine, we show that the formal Lindstedt series are Gevrey.\n  We also study the case when $D = 2$, but the quasi-periodic orbits have only one independent frequency (Lower dimensional tori). Both when $γ= 0$ and when $γ\\ne 0$, we show that, under some mild non-degeneracy conditions on $V$, there are (at least two) formal Lindstedt series defined to all orders and that they are Gevrey. Furthermore, we can take $μ$ along a $1$ dimensional space.",

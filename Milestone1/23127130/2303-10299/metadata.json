    "abstract": "Niobium telluride (NbTe$_2$), an emerging transition metal dichalcogenide material, has been theoretically predicted to have nonlinear absorption properties and excellent optical response. However, only a few studies of the utilization of NbTe$_2$ in ultrafast photonics have been reported. In this work, a NbTe$_2$-based saturable absorber (SA) was applied in an erbium-doped fiber as a mode-locked device, and a vector soliton based on NbTe$_2$ was obtained for the first time. NbTe$_2$-PVA film SA was successfully prepared by the liquid-phase exfoliation and spin coating methods, with a modulation depth of up to 10.87%. The nonlinear absorption coefficient of NbTe$_2$-based SA film tested through the open-aperture Z-scan laser measurement is 0.62. A conventional soliton with a pulse duration of 858 fs was generated using NbTe$_2$-based SA, which was demonstrated to be a kind of polarization-locked vector soliton in further investigation. Our experimental results reveal the nonlinear optical properties of NbTe$_2$ and broaden its applications in ultrafast photonic devices.",

    "abstract": "Memes are the new-age conveyance mechanism for humor on social media sites. Memes often include an image and some text. Memes can be used to promote disinformation or hatred, thus it is crucial to investigate in details. We introduce Memotion 3, a new dataset with 10,000 annotated memes. Unlike other prevalent datasets in the domain, including prior iterations of Memotion, Memotion 3 introduces Hindi-English Codemixed memes while prior works in the area were limited to only the English memes. We describe the Memotion task, the data collection and the dataset creation methodologies. We also provide a baseline for the task. The baseline code and dataset will be made available at https://github.com/Shreyashm16/Memotion-3.0",

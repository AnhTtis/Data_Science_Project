    "abstract": "In GUT inspired $SO(5) \\times U(1)_X \\times SU(3)_C$ gauge-Higgs unification (GHU) in the Randall-Sundrum warped spacetime, the $W$ and $Z$ couplings of all 4D fermion modes become nontrivial. The $W$ and $Z$ couplings of zero-mode quarks and leptons slightly deviate from those in the SM, and the couplings take the matrix form in the space of Kaluza-Klein (KK) states. In particular, the 4D couplings and mass spectra in the KK states depend on the Aharonov-Bohm phase $ θ_H$ in the fifth dimension.\n  Nevertheless there emerge three astonishing sum rules among those coupling matrices, which guarantees the finiteness of certain combinations of corrections to vacuum polarization tensors. We confirm by numerical evaluation that the equality in the sum rules holds with 5 to 7 digits accuracy. Based on the sum rules we propose improved oblique parameters in GHU. Oblique corrections due to fermion 1-loop diagrams are found to be small.",

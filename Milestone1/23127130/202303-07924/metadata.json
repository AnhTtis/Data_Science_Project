    "abstract": "Thanks to the rise of self-supervised learning, automatic speech recognition\n(ASR) systems now achieve near-human performance on a wide variety of datasets.\nHowever, they still lack generalization capability and are not robust to domain\nshifts like accent variations. In this work, we use speech audio representing\nfour different French accents to create fine-tuning datasets that improve the\nrobustness of pre-trained ASR models. By incorporating various accents in the\ntraining set, we obtain both in-domain and out-of-domain improvements. Our\nnumerical experiments show that we can reduce error rates by up to 25%\n(relative) on African and Belgian accents compared to single-domain training\nwhile keeping a good performance on standard French.",

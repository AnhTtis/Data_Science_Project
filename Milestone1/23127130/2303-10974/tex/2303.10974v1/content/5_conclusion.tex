\section{Conclusion}


In this work, we propose a simple and effective approach to generate hallucinogens -- nonsensical gibberish  in one language that is translatable into another language by online translation tools. We evaluated our method on several popular online translation systems -- Google, DeepL, and Yandex.  We found out that such systems process adversarial examples unpredictably: they not only translate nonsensical input in Russian but also can not translate seemingly meaningful English phrases.  This vulnerability may interfere with understanding a new language and worsen user’s experience while using machine translation systems, and, hence, additional improvements of these tools are
required to establish better translation.

We show that a simple denoising autoencoder training criterion is equivalent to matching the score (with respect to the data) of a specific energy-based model to that of a nonparametric Parzen density estimator of the data. This yields several useful insights. It defines a proper probabilistic model for the denoising autoencoder technique, which makes it in principle possible to sample from them or rank examples by their energy. It suggests a different way to apply score matching that is related to learning to denoise and does not require computing second derivatives. It justifies the use of tied weights between the encoder and decoder and suggests ways to extend the success of denoising autoencoders to a larger family of energy-based models.}",

  abstract = {1. The contrast thresholds of a variety of grating patterns have been measured over a wide range of spatial frequencies.2. Contrast thresholds for the detection of gratings whose luminance profiles are sine, square, rectangular or saw-tooth waves can be simply related using Fourier theory.3. Over a wide range of spatial frequencies the contrast threshold of a grating is determined only by the amplitude of the fundamental Fourier component of its wave form.4. Gratings of complex wave form cannot be distinguished from sine-wave gratings until their contrast has been raised to a level at which the higher harmonic components reach their independent threshold.5. These findings can be explained by the existence within the nervous system of linearly operating independent mechanisms selectively sensitive to limited ranges of spatial frequencies.},

    abstract = "{Selection of an optimal estimator typically relies on either supervised training samples (pairs of measurements and their associated true values) or a prior probability model for the true values. Here, we consider the problem of obtaining a least squares estimator given a measurement process with known statistics (i.e., a likelihood function) and a set of unsupervised measurements, each arising from a corresponding true value drawn randomly from an unknown distribution. We develop a general expression for a nonparametric empirical Bayes least squares (NEBLS) estimator, which expresses the optimal least squares estimator in terms of the measurement density, with no explicit reference to the unknown (prior) density. We study the conditions under which such estimators exist and derive specific forms for a variety of different measurement processes. We further show that each of these NEBLS estimators may be used to express the mean squared estimation error as an expectation over the measurement density alone, thus generalizing Stein's unbiased risk estimator (SURE), which provides such an expression for the additive gaussian noise case. This error expression may then be optimized over noisy measurement samples, in the absence of supervised training data, yielding a generalized SURE-optimized parametric least squares (SURE2PLS) estimator. In the special case of a linear parameterization (i.e., a sum of nonlinear kernel functions), the objective function is quadratic, and we derive an incremental form for learning this estimator from data. We also show that combining the NEBLS form with its corresponding generalized SURE expression produces a generalization of the score-matching procedure for parametric density estimation. Finally, we have implemented several examples of such estimators, and we show that their performance is comparable to their optimal Bayesian or supervised regression counterparts for moderate to large amounts of data.}",

Three basic criticisms were raised against the traditional error visibility approach: (1) it is based on near-threshold performance, (2) its geometric meaning may be limited, and (3) stationary pooling strategies may not be statistically justified. These criticisms and the good performance of structural and information-theory-based metrics have popularized the idea of their superiority over the error visibility approach. In this work we experimentally or analytically show that the above criticisms do not apply to error visibility metrics that use a general enough divisive normalization masking model. Therefore, the traditional divisive normalization metric 1 is not intrinsically inferior to the newer approaches. In fact, experiments on a number of databases including a wide range of distortions show that divisive normalization is fairly competitive with the newer approaches, robust, and easy to interpret in linear terms. These results suggest that, despite the criticisms of the traditional error visibility approach, divisive normalization masking models should be considered in the image quality discussion.},

TITLE={In Praise of Artifice Reloaded: Caution With Image Databases in Modeling Vision},
JOURNAL={Front. Neurosci.},
VOLUME={13},
PAGES={1-17},
YEAR={2019},
ABSTRACT={Subjective image quality databases are a major source of raw data on how the visual system works in naturalistic environments. These databases describe the sensitivity of many observers to a wide range of distortions of different nature and intensity seen on top of a variety of natural images. Data of this kind seems to open a number of possibilities for the vision scientist to check the models in realistic scenarios. However, while these natural databases are great benchmarks for models developed in some other way (e.g., by using the well-controlled artificial stimuli of traditional psychophysics), they should be carefully used when trying to fit vision models. Given the high dimensionality of the image space, it is very likely that some basic phenomena are under-represented in the database. Therefore, a model fitted on these large-scale natural databases will not reproduce these under-represented basic phenomena that could otherwise be easily illustrated with well selected artificial stimuli. In this work we study a specific example of the above statement. A standard cortical model using wavelets and divisive normalization tuned to reproduce subjective opinion on a large image quality dataset fails to reproduce basic cross-masking. Here we outline a solution for this problem by using artificial stimuli and by proposing a modification that makes the model easier to tune. Then, we show that the modified model is still competitive in the large-scale database. Our simulations with these artificial stimuli show that when using steerable wavelets, the conventional unit norm Gaussian kernels in divisive normalization should be multiplied by high-pass filters to reproduce basic trends in masking. Basic visual phenomena may be misrepresented in large natural image datasets but this can be solved with model-interpretable stimuli. This is an additional argument in praise of artifice in line with Rust and Movshon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">2005</xref>).}

abstract = "This is a review of the research during the past 25years on cortical processing of color signals. At the beginning of the period the modular view of cortical processing predominated. However, at present an alternative view, that color and form are linked inextricably in visual cortical processing, is more persuasive than it seemed in 1985. Also, the role of the primary visual cortex, V1, in color processing now seems much larger than it did in 1985. The re-evaluation of the important role of V1 in color vision was caused in part by investigations of human V1 responses to color, measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI, and in part by the results of numerous studies of single-unit neurophysiology in non-human primates. The neurophysiological results have highlighted the importance of double-opponent cells in V1. Another new concept is population coding of hue, saturation, and brightness in cortical neuronal population activity."

@article{Carandini12,
    abstract = {{
                There is increasing evidence that the brain relies on a set of canonical neural computations,
                repeating them across brain regions and modalities to apply similar operations to different problems.
                A promising candidate for such a computation is normalization, in which the responses of neurons are
                divided by a common factor that typically includes the summed activity of a pool of neurons.
                Normalization was developed to explain responses in the primary visual cortex and is now thought to
                operate throughout the visual system, and in many other sensory modalities and brain regions.
                Normalization may underlie operations such as the representation of odours, the modulatory effects of visual attention,
                the encoding of value and the integration of multisensory information. Its presence in such a diversity of neural
                systems in multiple species, from invertebrates to mammals, suggests that it serves as a canonical neural computation.

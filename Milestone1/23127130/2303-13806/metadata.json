    "abstract": "In this letter, we investigate a novel quadrature spatial scattering modulation (QSSM) transmission technique based on millimeter wave (mmWave) systems, in which the transmitter generates two orthogonal beams targeting candidate scatterers in the channel to carry the real and imaginary parts of the conventional signal, respectively. Meanwhile, the maximum likelihood (ML) detector is adopted at the receiver to recover the received beams and signals. Based on the ML detector, we derive the closed-form average bit error probability (ABEP) expression of the QSSM scheme. Furthermore, we evaluate the asymptotic ABEP expression of the proposed scheme. Monte Carlo simulations verify the exactness and tightness of the derivation results. It is shown that the ABEP performance of QSSM is better than that of traditional spatial scattering modulation.",

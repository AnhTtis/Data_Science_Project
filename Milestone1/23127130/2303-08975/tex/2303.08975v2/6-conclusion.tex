\section{Limitations and Future Work}
\vspace{-0.1in}
\peralgabbr{} assumes cables are not occluded by large, non-cable objects, are in semi-planar configurations, and are distinguishable from the background, which is one uniform color. Additionally, \peralgabbr{} is not trained on cables with a wide range of physical (e.g. thickness) and material (elasticity, bending radius) properties, such as loose string or rubbery tubing; and certain empirical experimentation suggests that for significantly thicker ropes and threads that form ``kinks'', performance of \peralgabbr{} suffers due to the out-of-distribution nature of these cases. Future work will aim to mitigate these problems and also generalize across more broadly varying backgrounds and properties of cable.
% Furthermore, \peralgabbr{} could capitalize on color and thickness-consistency to improve accuracy in cluttered scenes.
Another area of work will involve sampling multiple likely traces from the model and using resultant uncertainty as a signal downstream as a means of mitigating noise.
% Lastly, \peralgabbr{} requires an initialization of the trace (provided by an analytic tracer); future work will aim to train the learned tracer to begin from the endpoint itself.
 % limited in that the endpoint we begin tracing at must be isolated for at least 3 trace steps to allow the analytic tracer to successfully trace and provide a starting input for the learned tracer. F
 % with as few as 1 prior trace step to mitigate this limitation at the starting endpoint.

% thus, it is difficult to understand how much of the model's performance comes from processing the visual features of the cable compared to geometric extrapolation of the prior spline points. E

% \section{Conclusion}
% This work presents \peralgabbr{}, a perception pipeline that iteratively traces and determines the topology of semi-planar cable configurations, detects knots given the cable state, and detects graspable points for untangling the knots. Experiments show that \peralgabbr{} can successfully trace a single cable in a multi-cable setting with 80\% accuracy, significantly outperforming an analytic baseline. \peralgabbr{} is also able to detect knots with 77\% accuracy. Lastly, when \peralgabbr{} is applied to a robot untangling problem, the system is able to achieve 64\% success in untangling.

    "abstract": "We introduce an ultrafast and all-optical approach for efficient chiral recognition which relies on the interference between two low-order nonlinear processes which are ubiquitous in nonlinear optics: sum-frequency generation (SFG) and third-harmonic generation. In contrast to traditional SFG, our approach encodes the medium's handedness in the intensity of the emitted harmonic signal, rather than in its phase, and it enables full control over the enantio-sensitive response. We show how, by sculpting the sub-optical-cycle oscillations of the driving laser field in time, we can force a pre-selected molecular enantiomer to emit bright harmonic light while its mirror twin remains dark, thus reaching the ultimate efficiency limit of chiral sensitivity. Our work paves the way for ultrafast and highly efficient imaging and control of the chiral electronic clouds of chiral molecules using lasers with moderate intensities, in all states of matter: from gases to liquids to solids, with molecular specificity and on ultrafast timescales.",

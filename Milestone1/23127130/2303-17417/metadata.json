    "abstract": "In relativistic heavy-ion collisions, the longitudinal fluctuations of the fireball density caused, e.g., by baryon stopping fluctuations result in event-by-event modifications of the shape of the proton rapidity density distribution. The multiparticle rapidity correlation functions due to the varying distribution width of the proton rapidity density in central Au+Au collisions at low energies are derived. The cumulant ratios are calculated and discussed in the context of the recent STAR Collaboration results. We find that the cumulant ratios for small width fluctuations seem to be universal.",

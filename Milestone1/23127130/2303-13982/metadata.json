    "abstract": "A quantum kicked rotor model is one of the promising systems to realize various Floquet topological phases. We consider a double-kicked rotor model for a one-dimensional quasi-spin-1/2 Bose-Einstein condensate with spin-dependent and spin-independent kicks which are implementable for cold atomic experiments. We theoretically show that the model can realize all the Altland-Zirnbauer classes with nontrivial topology in one dimension. In the case of class CII, we show that a pair of winding numbers $(w_0,w_π)\\in 2\\mathbb{Z}\\times 2\\mathbb{Z}$ featuring the edge states at zero and $π$ quasienergy, respectively, takes various values depending on the strengths of the kicks. We also find that the winding numbers change to $\\mathbb{Z}$ when we break the time-reversal and particle-hole symmetries by changing the phase of a kicking lattice. We numerically confirm that the winding numbers can be obtained by measuring the mean chiral displacement in the long time limit in the present case with four internal degrees of freedom. We further propose two feasible methods to experimentally realize the spin-dependent and spin-independent kicks required for various topological phases.",

    "abstract": "We develop a formula for the diagonal values of the Hadamard coefficients associated to a normally hyperbolic operator on a globally hyperbolic spacetime in terms of the advanced and retarded Green's operators. We develop a local formula as well as formulae for integrals over (parts of) the diagonal. Furthermore, we develop analogues of the Hadamard expansion for powers of the advanced/retarded Green's operators and an analogue of a resolvent.",

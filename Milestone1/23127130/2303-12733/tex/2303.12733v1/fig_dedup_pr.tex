\caption{Here, we compute an exhaustive nearest neighbor search for 10k samples. Then we use the raw clip features as a duplication ground truth. Out of 10k samples, 9k were marked as near duplicates by the raw clip features (ViT-L-14). The above figure demonstrates that after a certain threshold, everything is marked as a duplicate. The precision is high merely because the labels are highly imbalanced. This shows that our method should miss some duplicates over the whole set. In practice, we choose an adaptive threshold of 1\%.}

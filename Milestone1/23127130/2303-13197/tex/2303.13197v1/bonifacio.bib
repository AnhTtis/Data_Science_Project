	abstract = {This work develops application techniques for stochastic modeling of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) variability as a probe of accretion disk physics. Stochastic models, specifically Continuous Auto-Regressive Moving Average (CARMA) models, characterize light curves with a perturbation spectrum and an Impulse-Response function, which crucially provides an interpretation for variability timescales. CARMA timescales are not physical but rather, they describe correlation structure and ordered information in stochastic processes. We begin this tutorial by reviewing discrete auto-regressive and moving-average processes, we bridge these components to their continuous analogs, and lastly we investigate the significance of CARMA timescales, obtained by modeling a light curve in the time domain, in relation to the shape of the power spectrum (PSD) and structure function. We determine that higher order CARMA models, for example the Damped Harmonic Oscillator (DHO or CARMA(2, 1)) are more sensitive to deviations from a single-slope power-law description of AGN variability; unlike Damped Random Walks (DRW or CAR(1)) where the PSD slope is fixed, the DHO slope is not. Higher complexity stochastic models than the DRW capture additional covariance in data and output additional characteristic timescales that probe the driving mechanisms of variability. We provide code using Kali software to generate simulations of diverse complexity stochastic light curves. We also provide a heuristic discussion of aliasing effects in ground-based cadences and the importance of light curve length in regards to uncertainty and limitations in timescale estimation.}

abstract = {How can we efficiently propagate uncertainty in a latent state representation with recurrent neural networks? This paper introduces stochastic recurrent neural networks which glue a deterministic recurrent neural network and a state space model together to form a stochastic and sequential neural generative model. The clear separation of deterministic and stochastic layers allows a structured variational inference network to track the factorization of the model's posterior distribution. By retaining both the nonlinear recursive structure of a recurrent neural network and averaging over the uncertainty in a latent path, like a state space model, we improve the state of the art results on the Blizzard and TTMIT speech modeling data sets by a large margin, while achieving comparable performances to competing methods on polyphonic music modeling.},

abstract = {This review paper provides an overview of data pre-processing in Machine learning, focusing on all types of problems while building the machine learning problems. It deals with two significant issues in the pre-processing process (i). issues with data and (ii). Steps to follow to do data analysis with its best approach. As raw data are vulnerable to noise, corruption, missing, and inconsistent data, it is necessary to perform pre-processing steps, which is done using classification, clustering, and association and many other pre-processing techniques available. Poor data can primarily affect the accuracy and lead to false prediction, so it is necessary to improve the dataset's quality. So, data pre-processing is the best way to deal with such problems. It makes the knowledge extraction from the data set much easier with cleaning, Integration, transformation, and reduction methods. The issue with Data missing and significant differences in the variety of data always exists as the information is collected through multiple sources and from a real-world application. So, the data augmentation approach generates data for machine learning models. To decrease the dependency on training data and to improve the performance of the machine learning model. This paper discusses flipping, rotating with slight degrees and others to augment the image data and shows how to perform data augmentation methods without distorting the original data.}

\section{More Results on Waymo Subsets}

To reduce performance variance on our 5\% and 10\% splits of the Waymo~\cite{Waymo} dataset, we randomly sample each split three times to form three subsets. In the main paper, we report the detection results of SST fine-tuned with Subset 0. In this supplementary material, we present the detection results of SST fine-tuned with the other two subsets in \cref{tab:subset1} and \cref{tab:subset2}. Additionally, we report the average results across all three subsets in \cref{tab:average}.

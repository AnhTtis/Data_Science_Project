\section{Experiments with Convolution-based Detectors}

\noindent\textbf{Implementation details.}\quad Our MVJ and MVR directly mask the raw inputs of LiDAR point clouds, making them suitable for most 3D detectors that downsample the point clouds into voxels and extract voxel features for perception. However, MVJ aims at predicting the voxel positions, which is necessary for convolutional operations. Directly applying MVJ to convolution-based backbones may result in information leakage and trivial pre-training. This is not an issue with Transformer-based backbones, as the attention mechanism does not require position information to perform, and we do not add positional embeddings during pre-training. On the other hand, MVR predicts voxel shapes while retaining position information, making it compatible with convolution-based detectors without modification.

To overcome the limitation of MVJ when applied to convolution-based detectors, we permutate the masked voxels by randomly placing them in the partitioned window before feeding them to the convolutional backbones. This permutation hides the original position information of the masked voxels, avoiding information leakage and making MVJ pre-training meaningful.

\noindent\textbf{Experimental Results.}\quad To evaluate the performance of our proposed methods on convolution-based detectors, we pre-train PointPillar~\cite{pointpillars} and CenterPoint (Pillar)~\cite{centerpoint} with MVR and MVJ as SST. We fine-tune these models on our 5\% split and report their overall L2 performances in \cref{tab:performances_convolution_backbones}. Our experimental results demonstrate that both MVJ and MVR can work effectively for convolution-based detectors, showcasing the generalization abilities of our methods.

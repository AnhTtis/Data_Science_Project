    "abstract": "Multiple exposures, of a single illuminated non-configurable mask that is transversely displaced to a number of specified positions, can be used to create any desired distribution of radiant exposure. An experimental proof-of-concept is given for this idea, employing hard X rays. The method is termed \"ghost projection\", since it may be viewed as a reversed form of classical ghost imaging. The written pattern is arbitrary, up to a tunable constant offset, together with a limiting spatial resolution that is governed by the finest features present in the illuminated mask. The method, which is immune to both proximity-correction and aspect-ratio issues, can be used to make a universal lithographic mask in the hard-X-ray regime. Ghost projection may also be used as a dynamically-configurable beam-shaping element, namely the hard-X-ray equivalent of a spatial light modulator. The idea may be applied to other forms of radiation and matter waves, such as gamma rays, neutrons, electrons, muons, and atomic beams.",

abstract = {The sudden outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in tough challenges for the field of biometrics due to its spread via physical contact, and the regulations of wearing face masks. Given these constraints, voice biometrics can offer a suitable contact-less biometric solution; they can benefit from models that classify whether a speaker is wearing a mask or not. This article reviews the Mask Sub-Challenge (MSC) of the INTERSPEECH 2020 COMputational PARalinguistics challengE (ComParE), which focused on the following classification task: Given an audio chunk of a speaker, classify whether the speaker is wearing a mask or not. First, we report the collection of the Mask Augsburg Speech Corpus (MASC) and the baseline approaches used to solve the problem, achieving a performance of 71.8\% Unweighted Average Recall (UAR). We then summarise the methodologies explored in the submitted and accepted papers that mainly used two common patterns: (i) phonetic-based audio features, or (ii) spectrogram representations of audio combined with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) typically used in image processing. Most approaches enhance their models by adapting ensembles of different models and attempting to increase the size of the training data using various techniques. We review and discuss the results of the participants of this sub-challenge, where the winner scored a UAR of 80.1\%. Moreover, we present the results of fusing the approaches, leading to a UAR of 82.6\%. Finally, we present a smartphone app that can be used as a proof of concept demonstration to detect in real-time whether users are wearing a face mask; we also benchmark the run-time of the best models.}

How to leverage rich heterogeneous data based on various signals such as mobility, testing, and/or disease exposure for forecasting? How to handle noisy data and generate uncertainties in the forecast? In this paper, we present DeepCOVID, an operational deep learning framework designed for real-time COVID-19 forecasting. DeepCOVID works well with sparse data and can handle noisy heterogeneous data signals by propagating the uncertainty from the data in a principled manner resulting in meaningful uncertainties in the forecast. The deployed framework also consists of modules for both real-time and retrospective exploratory analysis to enable interpretation of the forecasts. Results from real-time predictions (featured on the CDC website and FiveThirtyEight.com) since April 2020 indicates that our approach is competitive among the methods in the COVID-19 Forecast Hub, especially for short-term predictions.}, number={17}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Rodríguez, Alexander and Tabassum, Anika and Cui, Jiaming and Xie, Jiajia and Ho, Javen and Agarwal, Pulak and Adhikari, Bijaya and Prakash, B.

Sensing applications represent a new paradigm for network operation, one that has different goals from more traditional wireless networks. This paper examines this emerging field to classify wireless micro-sensor networks according to different communication functions, data delivery models, and network dynamics. This taxonomy will aid in defining appropriate communication infrastructures for different sensor network application sub-spaces, allowing network designers to choose the protocol architecture that best matches the goals of their application. In addition, this taxonomy will enable new sensor network models to be defined for use in further research in this area.},

  abstract = 	 {Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) are commonly developed at a fixed resource budget, and then scaled up for better accuracy if more resources are given. In this paper, we systematically study model scaling and identify that carefully balancing network depth, width, and resolution can lead to better performance. Based on this observation, we propose a new scaling method that uniformly scales all dimensions of depth/width/resolution using a simple yet highly effective compound coefficient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on MobileNets and ResNet. To go even further, we use neural architecture search to design a new baseline network and scale it up to obtain a family of models, called EfficientNets, which achieve much better accuracy and efficiency than previous ConvNets. In particular, our EfficientNet-B7 achieves stateof-the-art 84.4\% top-1 / 97.1\% top-5 accuracy on ImageNet, while being 8.4x smaller and 6.1x faster on inference than the best existing ConvNet (Huang et al., 2018). Our EfficientNets also transfer well and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on CIFAR-100 (91.7\%), Flower (98.8\%), and 3 other transfer learning datasets, with an order of magnitude fewer parameters.}

	abstract = {The growing dependency on digital technologies is becoming a way of life, and at the same time, the collection of data using them for surveillance operations has raised concerns. Notably, some countries use digital surveillance technologies for tracking and monitoring individuals and populations to prevent the transmission of the new coronavirus. The technology has the capacity to contribute towards tackling the pandemic effectively, but the success also comes at the expense of privacy rights. The crucial point to make is regardless of who uses and which mechanism, in one way another will infringe personal privacy. Therefore, when considering the use of technologies to combat the pandemic, the focus should also be on the impact of facial recognition cameras, police surveillance drones, and other digital surveillance devices on the privacy rights of those under surveillance. The GDPR was established to ensure that information could be shared without causing any infringement on personal data and businesses; therefore, in generating Big Data, it is important to ensure that the information is securely collected, processed, transmitted, stored, and accessed in accordance with established rules. This paper focuses on Big Data challenges associated with surveillance methods used within the COVID-19 parameters. The aim of this research is to propose practical solutions to Big Data challenges associated with COVID-19 pandemic surveillance approaches. To that end, the researcher will identify the surveillance measures being used by countries in different regions, the sensitivity of generated data, and the issues associated with the collection of large volumes of data and finally propose feasible solutions to protect the privacy rights of the people, during the post-COVID-19 era.},

ABSTRACT = {As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread worldwide, an unprecedented amount of open data is being generated for medical, genetics, and epidemiological research. The unparalleled rate at which many research groups around the world are releasing data and publications on the ongoing pandemic is allowing other scientists to learn from local experiences and data generated on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is a need to integrate additional data sources that map and measure the role of social dynamics of such a unique worldwide event in biomedical, biological, and epidemiological analyses. For this purpose, we present a large-scale curated dataset of over 1.12 billion tweets, growing daily, related to COVID-19 chatter generated from 1 January 2020 to 27 June 2021 at the time of writing. This data source provides a freely available additional data source for researchers worldwide to conduct a wide and diverse number of research projects, such as epidemiological analyses, emotional and mental responses to social distancing measures, the identification of sources of misinformation, stratified measurement of sentiment towards the pandemic in near real time, among many others.},

    abstract = { As COVID-19 continues to spread, a variety of COVID-19 tracking apps (CTAs) have been introduced to help contain the pandemic. Deployment of this technology poses serious challenges of effectiveness, technological problems and risks to privacy and equity. The ethical use of CTAs depends heavily on the protection of voluntariness. Voluntary use of CTAs implies not only the absence of a legal obligation to employ the app but also the absence of more subtle forms of coercion such as enforced exclusion from certain social and work activities. The protection of individual rights to voluntary use can be enhanced through an ethics by design approach in the development of CTAs that treat the introduction of CTAs for what it is: a complete novelty that is being tested for the first time in democracies. }

abstract = {The implementation of digital contact tracing applications around the world to help reduce the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic represents one of the most ambitious uses of massive-scale citizen data ever attempted. There is major divergence among nations, however, between a “privacy-first” approach which protects citizens’ data at the cost of extremely limited access for public health authorities and researchers, and a “data-first” approach which stores large amounts of data which, while of immeasurable value to epidemiologists and other researchers, may significantly intrude upon citizens’ privacy. The lack of a consensus on privacy protection in the contact tracing process creates risks of non-compliance or deliberate obfuscation from citizens who fear revealing private aspects of their lives – a factor greatly exacerbated by recent major scandals over online privacy and the illicit use of citizens’ digital information, which have heightened public consciousness of these issues and created significant new challenges for any collection of large-scale public data. While digital contact tracing for COVID-19 remains in its infancy, the lack of consensus around best practices for its implementation and for reassuring citizens of the protection of their privacy may already have impeded its capacity to contribute to the pandemic response.}

    abstract = "Multiple studies have demonstrated that behaviors expressed on online social media platforms can indicate the mental health state of an individual. The widespread availability of such data has spurred interest in mental health research, using several datasets where individuals are labeled with mental health conditions. While previous research has raised concerns about possible biases in models produced from this data, no study has investigated how these biases manifest themselves with regards to demographic groups in data, such as gender and racial/ethnic groups. Here, we analyze the fairness of depression classifiers trained on Twitter data with respect to gender and racial demographic groups. We find that model performance differs for underrepresented groups, and we investigate sources of these biases beyond data representation. Our study results in recommendations on how to avoid these biases in future research.",

    "abstract": "We have solved a number of holonomic PDEs derived from the Bessel modules which are related to the generating functions of classical Bessel functions and the difference Bessel functions recently discovered by Bohner and Cuchta. This $D$-module approach both unifies and extends generating functions of the classical and the difference Bessel functions. It shows that the algebraic structures of the Bessel modules and related modules determine the possible formats of Bessel's generating functions studied in this article. As a consequence of these $D$-modules structures, a number of new recursion formulae, integral representations and new difference Bessel polynomials have been discovered. The key ingredients of our argument involve new transmutation formulae related to the Bessel modules and the construction of $D$-linear maps between different appropriately constructed submodules. This work can be viewed as $D$-module approach to Truesdell's $F$-equation theory specialised to Bessel functions. The framework presented in this article can be applied to other special functions.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we Fourier transform the Wightman function concerning energy and angular momentum on the $S^{D-1}$ spatial slice in radial quantization in $D = 2, 3$ dimensions. In each case, we use the conformal Ward Identities to solve systematically for the Fourier components. We then use these Fourier components to build conformal blocks for the four-point function in momentum space, giving a finite-volume version of the momentum-space conformal blocks. We check that this construction is consistent with the known result in infinite volume. Our buildings help find bootstrap equations that can give nontrivial constraints that do not appear in analysis in infinite volume. We show some examples of bootstrap equations and their nontriviality.",

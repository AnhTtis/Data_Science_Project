\section{DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK}

The presented framework demonstrates a teleoperation strategy designed around maximizing the set of user-commandable contact and kinematic constraints. We demonstrated the effectiveness of this strategy by teleoperating in scenarios that are difficult or impossible without the use of knee/elbow contacts, line contacts and arbitrary taskspace objectives. Through real-time feasibility assessment, the operator was able to successfully teleoperate in scenarios where human intuition is likely insufficient. 

Future work will focus on further decreasing operator burden through a number of improvements. One is through explicit modeling of contact modes. In addition to decreasing contact creation time, this allows enumerating contact mode transitions, such as the plane-to-line transition when during toe-off. Keyframe feasibility and interpolations can be improved by leveraging modern model-predictive control \cite{mastalli2020crocoddyl} to perform real-time dynamic feasibility assessment. Time-optimal approaches \cite{pham2014general} will be explored as a strategy for faster motion execution.

    "abstract": "We present a virtual reality (VR) framework designed to intuitively generate humanoid multi-contact maneuvers for use in unstructured environments. Our framework allows the operator to directly manipulate the inverse kinematics objectives which parameterize a trajectory. Kinematic objectives consisting of spatial poses, center-of-mass position and joint positions are used in an optimization based inverse kinematics solver to compute whole-body configurations while enforcing static contact stability. Virtual ``anchors'' allow the operator to freely drag and constrain the robot as well as modify objective weights and constraint sets. The interface's design novelty is a generalized use of anchors which enables arbitrary posture and contact modes. The operator is aided by visual cues of actuation feasibility and tools for rapid anchor placement. We demonstrate our approach in simulation and hardware on a NASA Valkyrie humanoid, focusing on multi-contact trajectories which are challenging to generate autonomously or through alternative teleoperation approaches.",

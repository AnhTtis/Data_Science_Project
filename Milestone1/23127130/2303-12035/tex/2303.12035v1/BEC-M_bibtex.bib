@article{Garnett2012,
abstract = {Nanoscience provides many strategies to construct high-performance materials and devices, including solar cells, thermoelectrics, sensors, transistors, and transparent electrodes. Bottom-up fabrication facilitates large-scale chemical synthesis without the need for patterning and etching processes that waste material and create surface defects. However, assembly and contacting procedures still require further development. Here, we demonstrate a light-induced plasmonic nanowelding technique to assemble metallic nanowires into large interconnected networks. The small gaps that form naturally at nanowire junctions enable effective light concentration and heating at the point where the wires need to be joined together. The extreme sensitivity of the heating efficiency on the junction geometry causes the welding process to self-limit when a physical connection between the wires is made. The localized nature of the heating prevents damage to low-thermal-budget substrates such as plastics and polymer solar cells. This work opens new avenues to control light, heat and mass transport at the nanoscale.},

@article{Khaligh2013,
abstract = {Silver nanowire transparent electrodes have received much attention as a replacement for indium tin oxide, particularly in organic solar cells. In this paper, we show that when silver nanowire electrodes conduct current at levels encountered in organic solar cells, the electrodes can fail in as little as 2 days. Electrode failure is caused by Joule heating which causes the nanowires to breakup and thus create an electrical discontinuity in the nanowire film. More heat is created, and thus failure occurs sooner, in more resistive electrodes and at higher current densities. Suggestions to improve the stability of silver nanowire electrodes are given.},

abstract = {Networks of silver nanowires appear set to replace expensive indium tin oxide as the transparent conducting electrode material in next generation devices. The success of this approach depends on optimizing the material conductivity, which until now has largely focused on minimizing the junction resistance between wires. However, there have been no detailed reports on what the junction resistance is, nor is there a known benchmark for the minimum attainable sheet resistance of an optimized network. In this paper, we present junction resistance measurements of individual silver nanowire junctions, producing for the first time a distribution of junction resistance values and conclusively demonstrating that the junction contribution to the overall resistance can be reduced beyond that of the wires through standard processing techniques. We find that this distribution shows the presence of a small percentage (6{\%}) of high-resistance junctions, and we show how these may impact the performance of network-based materi},

@article{Pandey2019,
abstract = {Some of the most sensitive and precise measurements—for example, of inertia1, gravity2 and rotation3—are based on matter-wave interferometry with free-falling atomic clouds. To achieve very high sensitivities, the interrogation time has to be very long, and consequently the experimental apparatus needs to be very tall (in some cases reaching ten or even one hundred metres) or the experiments must be performed in microgravity in space4–7. Cancelling gravitational acceleration (for example, in atomtronic circuits8,9 and matter-wave guides10) is expected to result in compact devices with extended interrogation times and therefore increased sensitivity. Here we demonstrate smooth and controllable matter-wave guides by transporting Bose–Einstein condensates (BECs) over macroscopic distances. We use a neutral-atom accelerator ring to bring BECs to very high speeds (16 times their sound velocity) and transport them in a magnetic matter-wave guide for 15 centimetres while fully preserving their internal coherence. The resulting high angular momentum of more than 40,000ħ per atom (where ħ is the reduced Planck constant) gives access to the higher Landau levels of quantum Hall states, and the hypersonic velocities achieved, combined with our ability to control potentials with picokelvin precision, will facilitate the study of superfluidity and give rise to tunnelling and a large range of transport regimes of ultracold atoms11–13. Coherent matter-wave guides are expected to enable interaction times of several seconds in highly compact devices and lead to portable guided-atom interferometers for applications such as inertial navigation and gravity mapping.},

    "abstract": "We demonstrate that a four-boson limit-cycle independent of the Efimov one appears in Hamiltonian systems at the unitary limit. The model interaction contains two-, three- and four-body short-range potentials, which disentangle the interwoven three- and four-boson cycles, for the universal trimer and tetramer energy levels, respectively. The limit-cycle associated with the correlation between the energies of two successive universal tetramer levels for fixed weakly bound trimer is found to be largely model independent. This is a universal manifestation of an independent four-boson scale associated with a cycle beyond the Efimov one.",

We show that complications arise when existing approaches to Voronoi coverage are applied for deploying a group of robots in non-convex environments. We present an algorithm that is guaranteed to converge to a local optimum. Our algorithm combines classical Voronoi coverage with the Lloyd algorithm and the local path planning algorithm TangentBug to compute the motion of the robots around obstacles and corners. We present the algorithm and prove convergence and optimality. We also discuss experimental results from an implementation with five robots. {\textcopyright}2010 IEEE.},

abstract = {In this paper, we consider mobile sensor networks that use spatiotemporal {G}aussian processes to predict a wide range of spatiotemporal physical phenomena. Nonparametric Gaussian process regression that is based on truncated observations is proposed for mobile sensor networks with limited memory and computational power. We first provide a theoretical foundation of Gaussian process regression with truncated observations. In particular, we demonstrate that prediction using all observations can be well approximated by prediction using truncated observations under certain conditions. Inspired by the analysis, we then propose a centralized navigation strategy for mobile sensor networks to move in order to reduce prediction error variances at points of interest. For the case in which each agent has a limited communication range, we propose a distributed navigation strategy. Particularly, we demonstrate that mobile sensing agents with the distributed navigation strategy produce an emergent, swarming-like, collective behavior for communication connectivity and are coordinated to improve the quality of the collective prediction capability. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

@article{XuChoi2011,
abstract = {This paper presents a novel class of self-organizing sensing agents that adaptively learn an anisotropic, spatio-temporal Gaussian process using noisy measurements and move in order to improve the quality of the estimated covariance function. This approach is based on a class of anisotropic covariance functions of Gaussian processes introduced to model a broad range of spatio-temporal physical phenomena. The covariance function is assumed to be unknown a priori. Hence, it is estimated by the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimator. The prediction of the field of interest is then obtained based on the MAP estimate of the covariance function. An optimal sampling strategy is proposed to minimize the information-theoretic cost function of the Fisher Information Matrix. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and the adaptability of the proposed scheme. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

@article{Krause2008,
abstract = {When monitoring spatial phenomena, which can often be modeled as Gaussian processes (GPs), choosing sensor locations is a fundamental task. There are several common strategies to address this task, for example, geometry or disk models, placing sensors at the points of highest entropy (variance) in the GP model, and A-, D-, or E-optimal design. In this paper, we tackle the combinatorial optimization problem of maximizing the mutual information between the chosen locations and the locations which are not selected. We prove that the problem of finding the configuration that maximizes mutual information is NP-complete. To address this issue, we describe a polynomial-time approximation that is within (1 - 1/e) of the optimum by exploiting the submodularity of mutual information. We also show how submodularity can be used to obtain online bounds, and design branch and bound search procedures. We then extend our algorithm to exploit lazy evaluations and local structure in the GP, yielding significant speedups. We also extend our approach to find placements which are robust against node failures and uncertainties in the model. These extensions are again associated with rigorous theoretical approximation guarantees, exploiting the submodularity of the objective function. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach towards optimizing mutual information in a very extensive empirical study on two real-world data sets.},

abstract = {Many applications require optimizing an unknown, noisy function that is expensive to evaluate. We formalize this task as a multi-armed bandit problem, where the payoff function is either sampled from a Gaussian process (GP) or has low RKHS norm. We resolve the important open problem of deriving regret bounds for this setting, which imply novel convergence rates for GP optimization. We analyze GP-UCB, an intuitive upper-confidence based algorithm, and bound its cumulative regret in terms of maximal information gain, establishing a novel connection between GP optimization and experimental design. Moreover, by bounding the latter in terms of operator spectra, we obtain explicit sublinear regret bounds for many commonly used covariance functions. In some important cases, our bounds have surprisingly weak dependence on the dimensionality. In our experiments on real sensor data, GP-UCB compares favorably with other heuristical GP optimization approaches. Copyright 2010 by the author(s)/owner(s).},

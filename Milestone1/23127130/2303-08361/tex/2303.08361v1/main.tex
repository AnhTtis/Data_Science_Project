% \section{Towards maximization of network resource efficiency} % resources/Existing resource inefficiency in federated learning} \label{sec:opportunity}

% Ideas
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item PSL with mixed-composition datasets
%     \item Mixed-composition datasets with multi-server support
%     \item PSL with multi-server support on mixed-composition datasets    
%     \item ad-hoc dynamic federated learning [federated learning happens in bursts - when appropriate devices are connected efficiently to a local server, they form a short-term ad-hoc network that updates the global model as well as their local personalized models]
%     \item Economic modelling for sharing models/data [a lot of subsequent ideas in this point]
%     \item Data dispersion via latent diffusion models [i.e., original data preservation]
%     \item differential privacy + federated learning; stochastic measurement/quantification of this area
%     \item benefits of communication efficiency - ties back into open problems for privacy, i.e., privacy influences the optimal communications
% \end{enumerate}

abstract = {We model the shapes of irregular small particles using multivariate lognormal statistics (Gaussian random shape), and compute absorption and scattering cross sections, asymmetry parameters, and scattering phase matrices in the ray optics approximation. The random shape is fully described by the autocovariance function, which can be conveniently modeled by two statistical parameters: the standard deviation of radius and the correlation length of angular variations. We present an efficient spherical harmonics method for generating sample Gaussian random particles, and outline a ray tracing algorithm that can be adapted to almost arbitrary, mathematically star-like particles. We study the scattering and absorption properties of Gaussian random particles much larger than the wavelength by systematically varying their statistical parameters and complex refractive indices. The results help us understand, in part, light scattering by solar system dust particles, and thereby constrain the physical properties of, for example, asteroid regoliths and cometary comae.}

abstract = {We study scattering of light by wavelength-scale spherical, cubic, and spheroidal particles as well as clusters of spherical particles for equal-volume-sphere size parameters 4â€xâ€10 and refractive indices 1.1â€mâ€2.0. Such particles exhibit three specific features in the regime of backscattering: first, the intensity shows a backscattering peak; second, the degree of linear polarization for unpolarized incident light is negative; and, third, the depolarization ratio is double-lobed. We find that the overall characteristics of the scattering-matrix elements can be explained by an internal field composed of waves propagating in opposite directions near the particle perimeter and forming standing waves, as well as a wave propagating forward with the wavelength of the internal medium. When moving from the central axis of the particle toward its perimeter, the internal field changes from a forward-propagating wave with a wavelength dictated by the particle refractive index toward a standing wave with an apparent wavelength of the surrounding medium. The mapping of the internal field to the scattered far field is like an interference dial where rotation of the dial by a quarter of a wavelength on the particle perimeter results in a change from a destructive to constructive interference feature in the angular patterns (or vice versa). The dial is a manifestation of a well-known rule of thumb: the number of maxima or minima in the scattering-matrix elements is given by the size parameter. We explain the backscattering peak as deriving from the backward-propagating internal wave near the particle perimeter. Negative polarization follows from the spatial asymmetry of the internal fields: inside the particle, the fields are amplified near the central plane perpendicular to the polarization state of incident light, resulting in more pronounced interference effects for the perpendicular polarization than for the parallel polarization. The double-lobe feature in the depolarization results from the same internal-field structure with leading cross-polarized fields located slightly different from the copolarized fields. We discuss practical implications of these findings for the retrieval of particle sizes, shapes, and refractive indices from observations and laboratory experiments.}

abstract = {We compute light scattering by stochastically deformed spheres using a volume integral equation formalism. For computational reasons we are restricted to volume equivalent size parameters less than about eight for a collection of particles in random orientation. To see how well light scattering by rough particles can be approximated by using equal volume spheroids (computed by the T-matrix method) or by spheres (computed using Mie theory), we compute standard deviations between the different models for the intensity and linear polarization. As expected, a spheroid is a much better approximation than a sphere, particularly in the case of linear polarization. Only as an exercise we assume a power law distribution of particle sizes and compute light scattering by our realizations the intensity shows a distinct opposition spike close to backscattering and linear polarization is qualitatively astonishingly close to that observed for atmosphere less solar system objects.}

	abstract = {This paper addresses the issue of collision avoidance using lane-change maneuvers. Of particular interest is to determine the minimum distance beyond which an obstacle cannot be avoided at a given initial speed. Using a planar bicycle model, we first compute the sharpest dynamically feasible maneuver by minimizing the longitudinal distance of a lane transition, assuming given initial and free final speeds. The minimum distance to an obstacle is then determined from the path traced by the optimal maneuver. Plotting the minimum distance in the phase plane establishes the clearance curve, a valuable tool for planning emergency maneuvers. For the bicycle model, the clearance curve is shown to closely correlate with the straight line produced by a point mass model. Examples demonstrate the use of the clearance curve for planning safe avoidance maneuvers.},

	abstract = {Research on collision avoidance has received significant attention in academia, but few attempts have been made regarding the impact of the real driver. Focusing on the hybrid vehicle controlled by a real driver, this paper proposes a combined yaw moment and steering torque control method based on driving behaviors during the emergency steering evasion (ESE). First, a CarSim vehicle model and a vision-based driving simulator are built to acquire and analyze ESE driving behaviors, and the trigger condition of the assistance is defined. Second, a preview distance adaptive driver steering model is created and followed by the calculation of the desired value of the steering angle and yaw rate from the planned collision avoidance path. Third, an ESE assistance controller is designed on the basis of the electric power steering (EPS) torque assistance law during normal driving and driving behaviors for the steering evasion lane change. Controllers used for this paper include a yaw rate tracking controller and a steering torque assistance fuzzy controller. The actuators are EPS, an electric stability program, and two hub motors in the rear axle. The preview distance is optimized by the particle swarm optimization method and the driving behavior-based ESE controller is tested with the driving simulator. The result shows that the optimized preview distance is credible, and the path tracking accuracy and the vehicle stability are improved with the help of the proposed ESE assistance controller by giving full consideration to driving behaviors in ESE.},

	doi = {10.17185/duepublico/48594},
	abstract = {The prospective safety impact assessment with multi-agent traffic simulation is an important approach for evaluating traffic safety effects of advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS) and automated driving systems, especially at their early development stage. The main challenge in the virtual simulation approach is that it requires a detailed and valid representation of interactive processes between driver, system and environment in traffic. Current driver models lack the consideration of driver individuality and often do not cover the entire chain of cognitive processes from information acquisition to action implementation. This led to the development of the Stochastic Cognitive Model (SCM) in order to consider adequately the individual characteristics as well as the cognitive and physical capabilities and weaknesses of the human driver. Most of the relevant information from the environment is retrieved by the driver's visual sense channel. Based on these pieces of information the driver forms an understanding of the current situation and makes decisions about his future behavior. Hence, modelling the driver's gaze behaviour, and thus visual perception of the traffic environment and relevant stimuli for action and decision making, is crucial and one of the most challenging issues for driver modelling. This paper focusses on a variety of factors that can have an impact on the driver's gaze behaviour. In detail, the impact of driver characteristics, driver states and situational traffic circumstances is investigated. Therefore, two experimental studies in real traffic and in a driving simulator were conducted. A significant impact of driver characteristics and driver states on the driver's gaze behaviour was observed in a driving simulator study with a with representative German driver sample under controlled conditions concerning traffic flow and surrounding. Differences in gaze behaviour, depending on various situational circumstances, in detail, when being faced with specific traffic scenarios, were investigated in a realistic driving study on a German motorway. Results of both studies are merged and reported and finally, the relevance of considering these factors for modelling cognitive driver behaviour is discussed.},

	abstract = {Driving Decision-making Mechanism (DDM) is identified as the key technology to ensure the driving safety of autonomous vehicle, which is mainly influenced by vehicle states and road conditions. However, previous studies have seldom considered road conditions and their coupled effects on driving decisions. Therefore, road conditions are introduced into DDM in this paper, and are based on a Support Vector Machine Regression (SVR) model, which is optimized by a weighted hybrid kernel function and a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, this study designs a DDM for autonomous vehicle. Then, the SVR model with RBF (Radial Basis Function) kernel function and BP (Back Propagation) neural network model are tested to validate the accuracy of the optimized SVR model. The results show that the optimized SVR model has the best performance than other two models. Finally, the effects of road conditions on driving decisions are analyzed quantitatively by comparing the reasoning results of DDM with different reference index combinations, and by the sensitivity analysis of DDM with added road conditions. The results demonstrate the significant improvement in the performance of DDM with added road conditions. It also shows that road conditions have the greatest influence on driving decisions at low traffic density, among those, the most influential is road visibility, then followed by adhesion coefficient, road curvature and road slope, while at high traffic density, they have almost no influence on driving decisions.},

	abstract = {Objective: The present study developed and tested a model of car following by human drivers. Background: Previous models of car following are based on 3-D parameters such as lead vehicle speed and distance information, which are not directly available to a driver. In the present paper we present the driving by visual angle (DVA) model, which is based on the visual information (visual angle and rate of change of visual angle) available to the driver. Method: Two experiments in a driving simulator examined car-following performance in response to speed variations of a lead vehicle defined by a sum of sine wave oscillations and ramp acceleration functions. In addition, the model was applied to six driving events using real world-driving data. Results: The model provided a good fit to car-following performance in the driving simulation studies as well as in real-world driving performance. A comparison with the advanced interactive microscopic simulator for urban and nonurban networks (AIMSUN) model, which is based on 3-D parameters, suggests that the DVA was more predictive of driver behavior in matching lead vehicle speed and distance headway. Conclusion: Car-following behavior can be modeled using only visual information to the driver and can produce performance more predictive of driver performance than models based on 3-D (speed or distance) information. Application: The DVA model has applications to several traffic safety issues, including automated driving systems and traffic flow models.},

	abstract = {UN Regulation 157, the first global regulation regarding the type-approval of Automated Driving Systems (ADS), has been adopted in 2021. In it, safety performance requirements are being defined for vehicles of automation Level 3, according to the SAE J3016, with a limited Operational Design Domain (ODD). In particular, for three types of events that are related to motorway driving, two models are provided to distinguish between pre­ ventable traffic scenarios, for which the ADS is expected to avoid an accident, and unpreventable traffic sce­ narios, for which accidents cannot be avoided and the ADS can only mitigate their severity. The models recreate the short-term behavior of a driver who reacts to an emergency. Two possible actions are predicted: either no reaction or full braking when danger is identified. In the present paper the two models are analyzed and compared with two additional models: an industry proposed model, the Responsibility Sensitive Safety frame­ work (RSS), and the Fuzzy Safety Model (FSM) proposed by the authors. As in the case of the two regulation models, also the RSS, although more sophisticated, assumes that the possible reaction by the driver is binary. This approach neglects the ability of a human driver to drive defensively and anticipate possible risks. Defensive drivers, indeed, may use comfortable decelerations in anticipation, to avoid finding themselves in an emergency situation. The FSM uses fuzzy logic to mimic this behavior.},

	abstract = {In the interest of driving safety, it is essential to understand driver risk assessment to develop human-centred automated driving systems. Visual perception plays a core role in observing, analysing, and predicting driving crash risks. Furthermore, comprehensive progress of visual perception has been achieved in the development of risk perception metrics. However, it is still of interest to understand driver control behaviours, which depend on visual perception. Therefore, the objective of this literature review is to assess the potential of coupling time-remaining cues for risk perception and braking control behaviour. First, conventional risk perception metrics are classiﬁed based on trajectory, contact, and state principles, along with new analysis metrics that have been derived from conventional ones. Then, the analysis metrics are discussed based on visual perception information. Next, driver risk assessment is summarised according to the environment, driver, and object characteristics. Moreover, braking behaviour models are compared in relation to visual perception variables, action affordances, and behaviour dynamics. The current review further discusses the possibility of applying driver behaviour modelling to perception, navigation, and spatial awareness in autonomous vehicles. This human-centred approach has the potential to improve interaction between drivers and automation.},

	abstract = {This study proposes a framework for human-like autonomous car-following planning based on deep reinforcement learning (deep RL). Historical driving data are fed into a simulation environment where an RL agent learns from trial and error interactions based on a reward function that signals how much the agent deviates from the empirical data. Through these interactions, an optimal policy, or car-following model that maps in a human-like way from speed, relative speed between a lead and following vehicle, and inter-vehicle spacing to acceleration of a following vehicle is finally obtained. The model can be continuously updated when more data are fed in. Two thousand car-following periods extracted from the 2015 Shanghai Naturalistic Driving Study were used to train the model and compare its performance with that of traditional and recent data-driven car-following models. As shown by this study’s results, a deep deterministic policy gradient car-following model that uses disparity between simulated and observed speed as the reward function and considers a reaction delay of 1 s, denoted as DDPGvRT, can reproduce human-like car-following behavior with higher accuracy than traditional and recent data-driven car-following models. Specifically, the DDPGvRT model has a spacing validation error of 18\% and speed validation error of 5\%, which are less than those of other models, including the intelligent driver model, models based on locally weighted regression, and conventional neural network-based models. Moreover, the DDPGvRT demonstrates good capability of generalization to various driving situations and can adapt to different drivers by continuously learning. This study demonstrates that reinforcement learning methodology can offer insight into driver behavior and can contribute to the development of human-like autonomous driving algorithms and traffic-flow models.},

	abstract = {The current paper proposes a novel stochastic procedure for modelling car-following behaviours on a multi-lane motorway. We develop an integrated multi-lane stochastic continuous car-following model where a deep learning architecture is used to estimate a probability of lane-changing (LC) manoeuvres. To the best of our knowledge, this work is among the very few papers which exploit deep learning to model driving behaviour on a multi-lane road. The objective of this study is to establish a coupled stochastic continuous multi-lane car-following model using Langevin equations to cope with probabilistic characteristics of LC manoeuvres. In particular, a stochastic volatility, derived from LC manoeuvres is introduced in a multi-lane stochastic optimal velocity model (SOVM). In additions, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is applied to estimate a probability of LC manoeuvres in the integrated multi-lane car-following model. Furthermore, imaged second-based trajectories of the lane-changer and surrounding vehicles are used to identify whether LC manoeuvres occur by using the CNN. Finally, the proposed method is validated using a real-world high-resolution vehicle trajectory dataset. The results indicate that the prediction of the integrated SOVM is almost identical to the observed trajectories of the lane-changers and the following vehicles in the initial and the target lane. It has been found that the proposed multi-lane SOVM can tackle the unpredictable fluctuations in the velocity of the vehicles in the acceleration/deceleration zone.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.aap.2021.106433},
	abstract = {When faced with an imminent collision threat, human vehicle drivers respond with braking in a manner which is stereotypical, yet modulated in complex ways by many factors, including the specific traffic situation and past driver eye movements. A computational model capturing these phenomena would have high applied value, for example in virtual vehicle safety testing methods, but existing models are either simplistic or not sufficiently validated. This paper extends an existing quantitative driver model for initiation and modulation of pre-crash brake response, to handle off-road glance behavior. The resulting models are fitted to time-series data from real-world naturalistic rear-end crashes and near-crashes. A stringent parameterization and model selection procedure is presented, based on particle swarm optimization and maximum likelihood estimation. A major contribution of this paper is the resulting first-ever fit of a computational model of human braking to real nearcrash and crash behavior data. The model selection results also permit novel conclusions regarding behavior and accident causation: Firstly, the results indicate that drivers have partial visual looming perception during offroad glances; that is, evidence for braking is collected, albeit at a slower pace, while the driver is looking away from the forward roadway. Secondly, the results suggest that an important causation factor in crashes without off-road glances may be a reduced responsiveness to visual looming, possibly associated with cognitive driver state (e.g., drowsiness or erroneous driver expectations). It is also demonstrated that a model parame­ terized on less-critical data, such as near-crashes, may also accurately reproduce driver behavior in highly critical situations, such as crashes.},

Our model is trained to maximize externally given reward functions for the free and car-following regimes rather than reproducing existing follower trajectories. The parameters of these reward functions such as desired speed, time gap, or accelerations resemble that of traditional models such as the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) and allow for explicitly implementing different driving styles. Moreover, they partially lift the black-box nature of conventional neural network models. The model is trained on leading speed profiles governed by a truncated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process reflecting a realistic leader's kinematics. This allows for arbitrary driving situations and an infinite supply of training data. For various parameterizations of the reward functions, and for a wide variety of artificial and real leader data, the model turned out to be unconditionally string stable, comfortable, and crash-free. String stability has been tested with a platoon of five followers following an artificial and a real leading trajectory. A cross-comparison with the IDM calibrated to the goodness-of-fit of the relative gaps showed a higher reward compared to the traditional model and a better goodness-of-fit.},

	abstract = {In urban environments traffic safety is primarily determined by the successful interaction between road users. In order to define behavioral requirements for future autonomous vehicles, an understanding of these interactions is needed. Therefore this paper analyzes the interaction between drivers and pedestrians at crosswalks from both the driver's and the pedestrian's perspective. A study with driving experiments in real-life traffic was conducted. The study not only investigates how drivers respond to pedestrians who intend to use the crosswalk, but also their response to pedestrians who waive their right-of-way. An analysis of recorded driving and video data identified typical behavior patterns of drivers approaching a crosswalk, as well as of pedestrians crossing on it. Supplemented by questionnaires filled in by drivers and pedestrians, we determined factors which have a relevant impact on successful driver-pedestrian interaction. We confirmed that with higher initial speeds, drivers tend to exhibit more anticipatory driving behavior. Contrary to previous studies, the presented results show a significant influence of the vehicle's speed on the pedestrian's decision process. The gained insights into the driver-pedestrian interaction process provide an opportunity to develop autonomous driving functions with a cooperative driving behavior that conforms to the expectations of both pedestrians and vehicle occupants.},

	abstract = {The cellular automata (CA) approach to traffic modelling is extended to allow for spatially homogeneous steady state solutions that cover a two-dimensional region in the flow–density plane. Hence these models fulfil a basic postulate of a three-phase traffic theory proposed by Kerner. This is achieved by a synchronization distance, within which a vehicle always tries to adjust its speed to that of the vehicle in front. In the CA models presented, the modelling of the free and safe speeds, the slow-to-start rules as well as some contributions to noise are based on the ideas of the Nagel–Schreckenberg-type modelling. It is shown that the proposed CA models can be very transparent and still reproduce the two main types of congested patterns (the general pattern and the synchronized flow pattern) as well as their dependence on the flows near an on-ramp, in qualitative agreement with the recently developed continuum version of the three-phase traffic theory (Kerner B S and Klenov S L 2002 J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 35 L31 ). These features are qualitatively different from those in previously considered CA traffic models. The probability of the breakdown phenomenon (i.e. of the phase transition from free flow to synchronized flow) as function of the flow rate to the on-ramp and of the flow rate on the road upstream of the on-ramp is investigated. The capacity drops at the on-ramp which occur due to the formation of different congested patterns are calculated.},

	url = {https://doi.org/10.4271/J3016_202104},
	abstract = {This document describes [motor] vehicle driving automation systems that perform part or all of the dynamic driving task (DDT) on a sustained basis. It provides a taxonomy with detailed definitions for six levels of driving automation, ranging from no driving automation (Level 0) to full driving automation (Level 5), in the context of [motor] vehicles (hereafter also referred to as “vehicle” or “vehicles”) and their operation on roadways: Level 0: No Driving Automation Level 1: Driver Assistance Level 2: Partial Driving Automation Level 3: Conditional Driving Automation Level 4: High Driving Automation Level 5: Full Driving Automation These level definitions, along with additional supporting terms and definitions provided herein, can be used to describe the full range of driving automation features equipped on [motor] vehicles in a functionally consistent and coherent manner. “On-road” refers to publicly accessible roadways (including parking areas and private campuses that permit public access) that collectively serve all road users, including cyclists, pedestrians, and users of vehicles with and without driving automation features. The levels apply to the driving automation feature(s) that are engaged in any given instance of on-road operation of an equipped vehicle. As such, although a given vehicle may be equipped with a driving automation system that is capable of delivering multiple driving automation features that perform at different levels, the level of driving automation exhibited in any given instance is determined by the feature(s) that are engaged. This document also refers to three primary actors in driving: the (human) user, the driving automation system, and other vehicle systems and components. These other vehicle systems and components (or the vehicle in general terms) do not include the driving automation system in this model, even though as a practical matter a driving automation system may actually share hardware and software components with other vehicle systems, such as a processing module(s) or operating code. The levels of driving automation are defined by reference to the specific role played by each of the three primary actors in performance of the DDT and/or DDT fallback. “Role” in this context refers to the expected role of a given primary actor, based on the design of the driving automation system in question and not necessarily to the actual performance of a given primary actor. For example, a driver who fails to monitor the roadway during engagement of a Level 1 adaptive cruise control (ACC) system still has the role of driver, even while s/he is neglecting it. Active safety systems, such as electronic stability control (ESC) and automatic emergency braking (AEB), and certain types of driver assistance systems, such as lane keeping assistance (LKA), are excluded from the scope of this driving automation taxonomy because they do not perform part or all of the DDT on a sustained basis, but rather provide momentary intervention during potentially hazardous situations. Due to the momentary nature of the actions of active safety systems, their intervention does not change or eliminate the role of the driver in performing part or all of the DDT, and thus are not considered to be driving automation, even though they perform automated functions. In addition, systems that inform, alert, or warn the driver about hazards in the driving environment are also outside the scope of this driving automation taxonomy, as they neither automate part or all of the DDT, nor change the driver’s role in performance of the DDT (see 8.13). It should be noted, however, that crash avoidance features, including intervention-type active safety systems, may be included in vehicles equipped with driving automation systems at any level. For automated driving system (ADS) features (i.e., Levels 3 to 5) that perform the complete DDT, crash mitigation and avoidance capability is part of ADS functionality (see also 8.13).},

It seems that such a rule is at least as accurate as any of the more elaborate rules of car-following that have been proposed over the last 50 years or so. Actually, the proposed model could be interpreted as a special case of existing models but with fewer parameters and a different logic. At least this should form a reasonable starting point for investigating other phenomena.},

	abstract = {Tasks such as steering, braking, and intercepting moving objects constitute a class of behaviors, known as visually guided actions, which are typically carried out under continuous control on the basis of visual information. Several decades of research on visually guided action have resulted in an inventory of control laws that describe for each task how information about the sufficiency of one's current state is used to make ongoing adjustments. Although a considerable amount of important research has been generated within this framework, several aspects of these tasks that are essential for successful performance cannot be captured. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the existing framework, discuss its limitations, and introduce a new framework that emphasizes the necessity of calibration and perceptual learning. Within the proposed framework, successful human performance on these tasks is a matter of learning to detect and calibrate optical information about the boundaries that separate possible from impossible actions. This resolves a long-lasting incompatibility between theories of visually guided action and the concept of an affordance. The implications of adopting this framework for the design of experiments and models of visually guided action are discussed.},

It is shown how the driver could, in principle, use visual information about time-to-collision in registering when he is on a collision course, in judging when to start braking, and in controlling his ongoing braking.

However, to ensure the validity of simulations, models are needed that accurately capture near-crash driver behavior, as observed in real traffic or driving experiments.
Method: Scientific articles were identified by a systematic approach, including extensive database searches. Criteria for inclusion were defined and applied, including the requirement that models should have been previously applied to simulate on-road collision avoidance behavior. Several selected models were implemented and tested in selected scenarios.
Results: The reviewed articles were grouped according to a rough taxonomy based on main emphasis, namely avoidance by braking, avoidance by steering, avoidance by a combination of braking and steering, effects of driver states and characteristics on avoidance, and simulation platforms.
Conclusion: A large number of near-collision driver behavior models have been proposed. Validation using human driving data has often been limited, but exceptions exist. The research field appears fragmented, but simulation-based comparison indicates that there may be more similarity between models than what is apparent from the model equations. Further comparison of models is recommended.},

These include: (i) car following is only one of many tasks that drivers perform simultaneously and receives therefore only intermittent attention and control (task scheduling/attention management), (ii) drivers are satisfied with a range of conditions that extend beyond the boundaries imposed by perceptual and control limitation (satisficing instead of optimal performance evaluation), and (iii) in each driving task drivers use a set of highly informative perceptual variables to guide decision making and control (perceptual rather than Newtonian input). To elucidate these issues, a general driver modeling framework is presented in which the car-following task is highlighted (Boer, E. R., \& Hoedemaeker, M. (1998).

	abstract = {This study provides a new method for better incorporating human factors in modeling car-following behavior. As the primary decision maker and vehicle operator, human driver is the vital component of the driving process. During the driving process, an external stimulus may trigger short-term psychological changes, and these changes are considered as the endogenous cause of many abnormal driving behaviors, which often lead to unsafe traffic disturbances and even crashes. In this paper, we investigate the intrinsic long-term driving characteristics and its short-term changes after driver experiences an external stimulus. A long- and short-term driving (LSTD) model is proposed to incorporate such changes into car-following driving behavior modelling. The long-term driving characteristics are extracted through a cluster analysis, and the changes after an external stimulus are identified and measured as the indicator of the short-term driving characteristics. NGSIM data are used to demonstrate the existence of LSTD characteristics, and the soundness of the LSTD model. Two classical car-following models (i.e. the intelligent driver model, Gipps’ model) are integrated with the LSTD model, and the integrated models show a promising performance as the errors decrease by 36.7\% and 35.7\%, respectively.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a car-following model to ensure the car-following safety, stability, comfort and fuel-optimal with consideration of the driver’s different driving habits under different headways. During the car-following state, the following vehicle’s acceleration is determined by its driving strategy in different headways to fit the driving habits. When the headway is overlong, the following vehicle will shorten the headway by a comfort and fuel-optimal acceleration–uniform motion–deceleration process to ensure the stable car-following behavior. When the headway is too short, the following vehicle take emergency brake to ensure the car-following safety. When the headway is within the desired range, the following vehicle can run at a relatively steady speed since the comfort driving is an important reason for drivers to adopt a new driving behavior. The numerical results show that the proposed model can ensure the safety, stability, comfort, fuel-optimal and the consistency with the driver’s driving habits under the car-following state.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a recurrent neural network based microscopic car following model that is able to accurately capture and predict traffic oscillation. Neural network models have gained increasing popularity in many fields and have been applied in modelling microscopic traffic flow dynamics due to their parameter-free and data-driven nature. We investigate the existing neural network based microscopic car following models, and find out that they are generally accurate in predicting traffic flow dynamics under normal traffic operational conditions. However, they do not maintain accuracy under conditions of traffic oscillation. To bridge this research gap, we first propose four neural network based models and evaluate their applicability to predict traffic oscillation. It is found that, with an appropriate structure and objective function, the recurrent neural network based model has the capability of perfectly re-establishing traffic oscillations and distinguish drivers characteristics. We further compare the proposed model with a classical car following model (Intelligent Driver Model). Based on our case study, the proposed model outperforms the classical car following model in predicting traffic oscillations with different driver characteristics.},

	abstract = {Car-following models are always of great interest of traffic engineers and researchers. In the age of mass data, this paper proposes a nonparametric car-following model driven by field data. Different from most of the existing car-following models, neither driver’s behaviour parameters nor fundamental diagrams are assumed in the data-driven model. The model is proposed based on the simple k-nearest neighbour, which outputs the average of the most similar cases, i.e., the most likely driving behaviour under the current circumstance. The inputs and outputs are selected, and the determination of the only parameter k is introduced. Three simulation scenarios are conducted to test the model. The first scenario is to simulate platoons following real leaders, where traffic waves with constant speed and the detailed trajectories are observed to be consistent with the empirical data. Driver’s rubbernecking behaviour and driving errors are simulated in the second and third scenarios, respectively. The time–space diagrams of the simulated trajectories are presented and explicitly analysed. It is demonstrated that the model is able to well replicate periodic traffic oscillations from the precursor stage to the decay stage. Without making any assumption, the fundamental diagrams for the simulated scenario coincide with the empirical fundamental diagrams. These all validate that the model can well reproduce the traffic characteristics contained by the field data. The nonparametric car-following model exhibits traffic dynamics in a simple and parsimonious manner.},

	abstract = {The area of traffic flow modelling and analysis that bridges civil engineering, computer science, and mathematics has gained significant momentum in the urban areas due to increasing vehicular population causing traffic congestion and accidents. Notably, the existence of mixed traffic conditions has been proven to be a significant contributor to road accidents and congestion. The interaction of vehicles takes place in both lateral and longitudinal directions, giving rise to a two-dimensional (2D) traffic behaviour. This behaviour contradicts with the traditional car-following (CF) or one-dimensional (1D) lane-based traffic flow. Existing one-dimensional CF models did the inclusion of lane changing and overtaking behaviour of the mixed traffic stream with specific alterations. However, these parameters cannot describe the continuous lateral manoeuvre of mixed traffic flow. This review focuses on all the significant contributions made by 2D models in evaluating the lateral and longitudinal vehicle behaviour simultaneously. The accommodation of vehicle heterogeneity into the car-following models (homogeneous traffic models) is discussed in detail, along with their shortcomings and research gaps. Also, the review of commercially existing microscopic traffic simulation frameworks built to evaluate real-world traffic scenario are presented. This review identified various vehicle parameters adopted by existing CF models and whether the current 2D traffic models developed from CF models effectively captured the vehicle behaviour in mixed traffic conditions. Findings of this study are outlined at the end.},

Background: HPM has been applied in numerous human factors domains such as surface transportation as it can quantify and predict human performance; however, there has been no integrated literature review for predicting driver behavior and interactions with in-vehicle technology in terms of the characteristics of methods used and variables explored.
Method: A systematic literature review was conducted using Compendex, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. As a result, 100 studies met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed by the authors. Model characteristics and variables were summarized to identify the research gaps and to provide a lookup table to select an appropriate method.
Results: The ﬁndings provided information on how to select an appropriate HPM based on a combination of independent and dependent variables. The review also summarized the characteristics, limitations, applications, modeling tools, and theoretical bases of the major HPMs.
Conclusion: The study provided a summary of state-ofthe-art on the use of HPM to model driver behavior and use of in-vehicle technology. We provided a table that can assist researchers to ﬁnd an appropriate modeling approach based on the study independent and dependent variables.},

Various advanced features like lane departure warning (LDW), blind spot warning (BSW), over speed warning (OSW), forward collision warning (FCW), lane keep assist (LKA), adaptive cruise control (ACC), cooperative ACC (CACC), and automated emergency braking (AEB) are designed to assist with, or in some cases take over, certain driving maneuvers. They can be broadly categorized into advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) and automated features. Each of these advanced features focuses on addressing a particular task of driving, thereby, aiding the driver, influencing their behavior, and enhancing safety. Many vehicles with these advanced features are penetrating into the market, yet the total reported number of crashes has increased in recent years. This paper presents a systematic review of these advanced features on driver behavior and safety. The review is categorized into 1) survey and mathematical methods to assess driver behavior, 2) field test methods to assess driver behavior, 3) microsimulation methods to assess driver behavior, 4) driving simulator methods to assess driver behavior, and 5) driver understanding and the effectiveness of advanced features.

	abstract = {For a decade, researchers working in the area of road safety have started exploring the use of driving behavior data for a better understanding of the causes related to road accidents. A review of the literature reveals the excellent potential of naturalistic driving studies carried out by collecting vehicle performance data and driver behavior data during normal, impaired, and safety-critical situations. An in-depth understanding of driver behavior helps analyze and implement pre-crash safety measures - the development of enforcement policies, infrastructure design, and intelligent vehicle safety systems. The present paper attempts to review the naturalistic driving studies that have been undertaken so far. The paper begins with an overview of different methods for collecting unobtrusive driver behavior data during their day to day trip, followed by a discussion of various factors affecting driving behavior and their influence on vehicle performance parameters. The paper also dis­ cusses the strategies mentioned in the literature for improving driving behavior using naturalistic driving studies to enhance road safety. Some of the major findings of this review suggest that i) driver behavior is a major cause in the majority of the road accidents ii) drivers generally reduce their speed and increases headway as a compensatory measure to reduce the workload imposed during distracting activity and adverse weather con­ ditions iii) mobile phone has emerged as a potential device for collecting naturalistic driving data and, iv) improvement in driving behavior can be achieved by providing feedback to the drivers about their driving behavior. This can be done by implementing usage-based insurance schemes such as pay as you drive (PAYD), pay how you drive (PHYD), and manage how you drive (MHYD). While a considerable amount of research has been done to analyze driving behavior under naturalistic conditions, some areas which are yet to be explored are highlighted in the present paper.},

They can design, analyze, and test their systems using computer simulation before physically manufacturing them. It is still questionable how these advanced systems would react with the human driver. One way to deal with this problem is to develop a computer model that is capable of controlling the vehicle in a way similar to human driver behavior. Fuzzy logic inference systems are known of their great ability to simulate human reasoning process as well as the possibility of being further trained to mimic specific human control process. This paper presents a new driver model using fuzzy logic controls. The model is designed to control the longitudinal as well as the lateral motions of the vehicle by performing simultaneous steering and braking commands. The model is tested on a vehicle model having an integrated active steering and direct yaw control strategy as developed by this paper's authors in [1]. The results show success of this fuzzy model in simulating driver control actions in curve following and collision avoidance maneuvers.},

A series of simulations is undertaken in typical driving conditions such as double lane change, speed or position following in straight line, braking-in-turn, high-speed U turn, etc. During the entire course of the simulations, the driver model has demonstrated the great accuracy in terms of following both the path and the vehicle speeds.

A trade-off strategy between longitudinal traction versus cornering traction was extracted experimentally by using jerk information to observe voluntary braking and turning during driving. The strategy is realised by determining the longitudinal acceleration command during combination motion by vehicle lateral jerk. The vehicle dynamical rationality of the method is also evaluated by computer simulation in view of instantaneous handling characteristics. Applying the strategy, we made a longitudinal driver model that works in coordination with any steering input. Adopting a programmed handling model and a preview-follower model for the steering input, we carried out computer simulation. We also carried out cornering and braking lane-change experiments with an expert driver. The simulation results and experimental results agree well and we confirm that the model can emulate a certain part of the expert driver's control strategy for trading off longitudinal and lateral accelerations.},

	abstract = {Driver models have been developed to capture collision-avoidance behaviors, yet there is a lack of understanding of what perceptual processes influence drivers’ choices to brake or steer. A statistical model of these decisions was developed with cluster analysis and multinomial logistic regression with data from a simulator study of drivers’ responses to rear-end collisions. Drivers’ choices of responses were clustered on the basis of the maximum values of the magnitude of braking and steering forces, starting from the time at which the driver looked back to the road, just before initiating the avoidance maneuver, to the end of the maneuver. The clusters identified three types of responses: medium to high braking with medium to high steering, medium to high braking with mild steering, and mild braking with medium to high steering. The perceptual variables such as the optical angle, the expansion rate of the optical angle, and their ratio were used to predict the drivers’ choice of response. The results show that, of the perceptual variables, the combination of optical angle and tau performs as well as or better than others in predicting the choice of response. The mode and timing of an alert from a collision-warning system did not influence the drivers’ choices. These results can inform driver behavior models to guide design and assess benefits of advanced driver assistance systems.},

	abstract = {In recent years, signiﬁcant emphases and efforts have been placed on developing and implementing advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). These systems need to work with human drivers to increase vehicle occupant safety, control, and performance in both ordinary and emergency driving situations. To aid such cooperation between human drivers and ADAS, driver models are necessary to replicate and predict human driving behaviors and distinguish among different drivers. This paper presents a combined driver model that is able to not only identify different individual driver behaviors, but also predict a driver’s behavior in rare vehicle maneuvers such as collision avoidance (CA) based on his/her daily driving data. The driver model consists of a compensatory transfer function and an anticipatory component and is integrated with the design of the individual driver’s desired path. It has been shown that the proposed driver model can replicate each driver’s steering wheel angle signal for a variety of highway and in-city maneuvers. The utility of the proposed driver model is its ability to predict a driver’s steering wheel angle signal for a CA maneuver from only daily nonemergency driving data. The driver model is then validated by comparing two different drivers’ model parameter sets to the group average to show that each driver has a unique set of parameters. Finally, the driver model is validated by showing that its daily driving parameters differ from its predicted CA parameters.},

First, unlike most existing car-following models that take only the instantaneous velocity, velocity difference, and position difference as inputs, this new model takes the velocities, velocity differences, and position differences that were observed in the last few time intervals as inputs. That is, we assume that drivers’ actions are temporally dependent in this model and try to embed prediction capability or memory effect of human drivers in a natural and efficient way. Second, this car-following model is built in a data-driven way, in which we reduce human interference to the minimum degree. Specially, we use recently developing deep neural networks rather than conventional neural networks to establish the model, since deep learning technique provides us more flexibility and accuracy to describe complicated human actions. Tests on empirical trajectory records show that this deep neural network-based car-following model yield significantly higher simulation accuracy than existing car-following models. All these findings provide a novel way to study traffic flow theory and traffic simulations.},

	abstract = {Objective:
              This article provides a review of empirical studies of automated vehicle takeovers and driver modeling to identify influential factors and their impacts on takeover performance and suggest driver models that can capture them.
            
            
              Background:
              Significant safety issues remain in automated-to-manual transitions of vehicle control. Developing models and computer simulations of automated vehicle control transitions may help designers mitigate these issues, but only if accurate models are used. Selecting accurate models requires estimating the impact of factors that influence takeovers.
            
            
              Method:
              Articles describing automated vehicle takeovers or driver modeling research were identified through a systematic approach. Inclusion criteria were used to identify relevant studies and models of braking, steering, and the complete takeover process for further review.
            
            
              Results:
              The reviewed studies on automated vehicle takeovers identified several factors that significantly influence takeover time and post-takeover control. Drivers were found to respond similarly between manual emergencies and automated takeovers, albeit with a delay. The findings suggest that existing braking and steering models for manual driving may be applicable to modeling automated vehicle takeovers.
            
            
              Conclusion:
              Time budget, repeated exposure to takeovers, silent failures, and handheld secondary tasks significantly influence takeover time. These factors in addition to takeover request modality, driving environment, non-handheld secondary tasks, level of automation, trust, fatigue, and alcohol significantly impact post-takeover control. Models that capture these effects through evidence accumulation were identified as promising directions for future work.
            
            
              Application:
              Stakeholders interested in driver behavior during automated vehicle takeovers may use this article to identify starting points for their work.},

	abstract = {Perception-reaction time (PRT) and deceleration rate are two key components in geometric design of highways and streets. Combined with a design speed, they determine the minimum required stopping sight distance (SSD). Current American Association of Highway Transportation Officials (AASHTO) SSD guidance is based on 90th percentile PRT and 10th percentile deceleration rate values from experiments completed in the mid-1990s. These experiments lacked real-world distractions, and so forth. Thus, the values from these experiments may not be applicable in real-world scenarios. This research evaluated (1) differences in PRTs and deceleration rates between crash and near-crash events and (2) developed predictive models for PRT and deceleration rate that could be used for roadway design. This was accomplished using (1) genetic matching (with Rosenbaum’s sensitivity analysis) and (2) quantile regression. These methods were applied to the Strategic Highway Research Program 2 (SHRP2) Naturalistic Driving Study (NDS) data.
            
              The analysis results indicated that there were differences in PRT and deceleration rates for crash and near-crash events. The specific estimates were that, on average, drivers involved in crash events took 0.487 s longer to react and decelerated at 0.018 g’s (0.58 ft/s
              2
              ) slower than drivers in equivalent near-crashes. Prediction models were developed for use in roadway design. These models were used to develop tables comparing existing SSD design criteria with SSD criteria based on the results of the predictive models. These predicted values indicated that minimum design SSD values would increase by 10.5–129.2 ft, dependent on the design speed and SSD model used.},

In areas such as fuel economy it has been shown that the behaviour of the driver plays a signiﬁcant role and as such a vehicle simulation used to investigate fuel economy should include a driver model that can mimic different driver behaviour. Historically fuel economy simulations have been undertaken with a reference speed proﬁle followed accurately with classical closed loop control and this approach will neglect some of the characteristics of real world driving that come from having a human driver.

The main goal of the article is to evaluate if gender, practice, or alcohol signiﬁcantly affected the reaction time of 30 drivers. We also focused on drinking before driving for a smaller number of the drivers; ten of them performed driving under the inﬂuence of alcohol.

	abstract = {This contribution analyzes the widely used and well-known “intelligent driver model” (brieﬂy IDM), which is a second order car-following model governed by a system of ordinary diﬀerential equations. Although this model was intensively studied in recent years for properly capturing traﬃc phenomena and driver braking behavior, a rigorous study of the well-posedness has, to our knowledge, never been performed. First it is shown that, for a speciﬁc class of initial data, the vehicles’ velocities become negative or even diverge to −∞ in ﬁnite time, both undesirable properties for a car-following model. Various modiﬁcations of the IDM are then proposed in order to avoid such ill-posedness. The theoretical remediation of the model, rather than post facto by ad-hoc modiﬁcation of code implementations, allows a more sound numerical implementation and preservation of the model features. Indeed, to avoid inconsistencies and ensure dynamics close to the one of the original model, one may need to inspect and clean large input data, which may result in practically impossible scenarios for large-scale simulations. Although well-posedness issues might only occur for speciﬁc initial data, this may happen frequently when diﬀerent traﬃc scenarios are analyzed, and especially in presence of lane-changing, on ramps and other network components as it is the case for most commonly used micro-simulators. On the other side, it is shown that well-posedness can be guaranteed by straightforward improvements, such as those obtained by slightly changing the acceleration to prevent the velocity from becoming negative.},

To make these driver assistance systems better cooperate with human drivers, the driver models need to be able to predict human driving behaviors and distinguish among different drivers. In this paper, a combined driver model consisting of a compensatory transfer function and an anticipatory component based on road geometry is integrated with the design of the individual driver's desired path. The proposed driver model parameters are obtained from human subject test data collected in a driving simulator. It has been shown that the proposed combined driver model is able to replicate each driver's steering wheel angle signals for a variety of maneuvers at different vehicle speeds. The driver model is then validated by first using a polynomial to interpolate the driver model and desired path parameters for an intermediate speed. It is also validated by comparing two different drivers' model parameter sets to show that each driver has a unique set of parameters. The final validation is to show that the proposed individual driver's desired path offers more accurate steering wheel fits than the previous geometric centerline.},

It is based on recent empirical research, in particular, on driver eye movements, that poses challenges for existing accounts of how we visually steer a course. They first analyze how the ideas of feedback and feedforward processes and internal models are treated in control theoretical steering models within vision science and engineering, which share an underlying architecture but have historically developed in very separate ways. The authors then show how these traditions can be naturally (re)integrated with each other and with contemporary neuroscience, to better understand the skill and gaze strategies involved. They then propose a conceptual model that (a) gives a unified account to the coordination of gaze and steering control, (b) incorporates higher-level path planning, and (c) draws on the literature on paired forward and inverse models in predictive control. Although each of these (a–c) has been considered before (also in the context of driving), integrating them into a single framework and the authors’ multiple waypoint identification hypothesis within that framework are novel. The proposed hypothesis is relevant to all forms of visually guided locomotion. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {The current study focused on analyzing steering control of the drivers during a car-following situation under increasing time pressure conditions. A driving simulator experiment was conducted on ninety-two participants to assess steering performance measures. Five different steering control measures: Variability in Steering Angle (VSA), Steering Reversal Rate (SRR), Steering Speed (SS), Stability of Steering Control (SSC), and Maximum Steering Swerve (MSS) were examined under No Time Pressure (NTP), Low Time Pressure (LTP), and High Time Pressure (HTP) driving conditions. Repeated measures ANOVA (for continuous data) and Friedman’s test (count data) with post-hoc analysis and Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) modeling technique were used to investigate the influence of time pressure and different predictor variables. The statistical analysis showed that time pressure driving conditions significantly affected steering control of the drivers. The pairwise comparison of time pressure conditions revealed that HTP significantly affected most of the steering control measures as compared to LTP. Further, a GEE model also exhibited similar results where steering control measures were substantially influenced by HTP as compared to LTP. Moreover, in addition to time pressure conditions, demographic characteristics showed significant influence on steering control measures. The GEE model results showed that female drivers performed 13\% more steering corrections (5° SRR) which led to better SSC by 124.44\% than male drivers. Additionally, it was discovered that young-aged and experienced drivers took extra steering efforts to control lateral position of the vehicle by increasing 53.50\% SS and 1\% SRR compared to middle-aged and inexperienced drivers. The findings from the current study revealed that drivers undergo fast and abrupt steering maneuvers under time pressure conditions. The research approach demonstrated in the current study can be beneficial to discriminate minimum requirement of steering efforts and set-up threshold values for various steering evasion techniques to control and maintain safe lateral position during car-following maneuvers.},

One critical issue in decision making process of autonomous driving vehicles is steering control. Researchers has already trained different artificial neural networks to predict steering angle with front-facing camera data stream. However, existing end-to-end methods only consider the spatiotemporal relation on a single layer and lack the ability of extracting future spatiotemporal information. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end driving model based on Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (Conv-LSTM) neural network with a Multi-scale Spatiotemporal Integration (MSI) module, which aiming to encode the spatiotemporal information from different scales for steering angle prediction. Moreover, we employ future sequential information to enhance spatiotemporal features of the end-to-end driving model. We demonstrate the efficiency of proposed end-to-end driving model on the public Udacity dataset with comparison of some existing methods. Experimental results show that the proposed model has better performances than other existing methods, especially in some complex scenarios. Furthermore, we evaluate the proposed driving model on a real-time autonomous vehicle, and results show that the proposed driving model is able to predict the steering angle with high accuracy compared to skilled human driver.},

However, these models are not applicable when a human needs to interact with autonomy in haptic shared control of autonomy-enabled UGVs. How a human operator reacts to the presence of autonomy needs to be studied and mathematically encapsulated in a module to capture the collaboration between human and autonomy.MethodHuman subject tests are conducted to collect data in haptic shared control for model development and validation. The ACT-R architecture and two-point steering model used in the previous literature are adopted to predict the operator?s desired steering angle. A torque conversion module is developed to convert the steering command from the ACT-R model to human torque input, thus enabling haptic shared control with autonomy. A parameterization strategy is described to find the set of model parameters that optimize the haptic shared control performance in terms of minimum average lane keeping error (ALKE).ResultsThe model predicts the minimum ALKE human subjects achieve in shared control.ConclusionsThe extended model can successfully predict the best haptic shared control performance as measured by ALKE.ApplicationThis model can be used in place of human operators, enabling fully simulation-based engineering, in the development and evaluation of haptic shared control technologies for autonomy-enabled UGVs, including control negotiation strategies and autonomy capabilities.},

Road user trajectories from two locations in China are extracted using computer vision techniques. The critical lateral distance (the shortest lateral distance to initiate avoidance maneuvers) is used as the lateral interaction indicator. Lateral interactions are modelled using the parametric accelerated failure time (AFT) duration model with a Weibull distribution, and the unobserved heterogeneity is considered using gamma frailty. The results show that interaction probabilities increase at higher MV speeds or NMV-MV speed differences and decrease with the NMV or MV yaw rates. The critical lateral distances when NMV ride in the MV lanes are shorter than those in the NMV lane. Moreover, bikes have higher interaction probabilities than e-bikes. These findings give insights into lateral interaction behaviours in mixed traffic and support better designs of such facilities.},

    "abstract": "In this paper, we address the discrete-time dynamic average consensus (DAC) of a multi-agent system in the presence of adversarial attacks. The adversarial attack is considered to be of Byzantine type, which compromises the computation capabilities of the agent and sends arbitrary false data to its neighbours. We assume a few of the agents cannot be compromised by adversaries, which we term trusted agents. We first formally define resilient DAC in the presence of Byzantine adversaries. Then we propose our novel Resilient Dynamic Average Consensus (ResDAC) algorithm that ensures the trusted and ordinary agents achieve resilient DAC in the presence of adversarial agents. The only requirements are that of the trusted agents forming a connected dominating set and the first-order differences of the reference signals being bounded. We do not impose any restriction on the tolerable number of adversarial agents that can be present in the network. We also do not restrict the reference signals to be bounded. Finally, we provide numerical simulations to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed ResDAC algorithm.",

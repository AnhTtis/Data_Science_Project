    The logical method proposed by Goubault, Ledent, and Rajsbaum
    provides a novel way to show  the unsolvability of distributed tasks
    by means of a logical obstruction, which is  an epistemic logic formula
    describing the reason of unsolvability.
    In this paper, we introduce the notion of partial product update, which refines
    that of product update in the original logical method, 
    to encompass distributed tasks and protocols modeled
    by impure simplicial complexes. 
    %
    With this extended notion of partial product update, the original
    logical method  is generalized so that it allows the application of
    logical obstruction to show unsolvability results in a distributed environment
    where the failure of agents is detectable.
    %
    We demonstrate the use of the logical method 
    by giving a concrete logical obstruction and showing that the consensus
    task is unsolvable by the single-round synchronous message-passing protocol.

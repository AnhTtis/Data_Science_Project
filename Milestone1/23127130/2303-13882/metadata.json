    "abstract": "Current models predict particles of the same material but different sizes to charge bipolar upon contacts; the resulting charge peaks endanger process safety. However, we found wall-bounded turbulence to suppress the powder's electrostatic charging. Aerodynamic forces skew the collision frequency and narrow the charge distribution's bandwidth. Bipolar charging reduces, especially in moderately polydisperse systems of a low Stokes number. Not the smallest but mid-sized particles charge most negatively. Moreover, turbulence separates charge, producing pockets of high electric potential in low-vorticity regions.",

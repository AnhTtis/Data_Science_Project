    "abstract": "Recent attacks of various viruses with having deep and extensive impact at a global scale has warranted that microbiome be studied extensively and in a robust analytic framework. Microbiome typically refers to the collective genomes of such organisms, although it could also refer to the collection of the organisms by themselves. Here we provide an overview of statistical techniques that are useful in analysing such data.",

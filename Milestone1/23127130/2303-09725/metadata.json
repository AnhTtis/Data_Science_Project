    "abstract": "\"As many of us know from bitter experience, the policies provided in extant operating systems, which are claimed to work well and behave fairly 'on the average', often fail to do so in the special cases important to us\" [Wulf et al. 1974]. Written in 1974, these words motivated moving policy decisions into user-space. Today, as warehouse-scale computers (WSCs) have become ubiquitous, it is time to move policy decisions away from individual servers altogether. Built-in policies are complex and often exhibit bad performance at scale. Meanwhile, the highly-controlled WSC setting presents opportunities to improve performance and predictability.\n  We propose moving all policy decisions from the OS kernel to the cluster manager (CM), in a new paradigm we call Grape CM. In this design, the role of the kernel is reduced to monitoring, sending metrics to the CM, and executing policy decisions made by the CM. The CM uses metrics from all kernels across the WSC to make informed policy choices, sending commands back to each kernel in the cluster. We claim that Grape CM will improve performance, transparency, and simplicity. Our initial experiments show how the CM can identify the optimal set of huge pages for any workload or improve memcached latency by 15%.",

As a byproduct, we provide continuum limit extrapolated results for the string tension, the Coulomb coupling and the Sommer parameter at \$T = 0\$ and \$B = 0\$. We confirm the presence in the continuum of a \$B\$-induced anisotropy, regarding essentially the string tension, for which it is of the order of 15{\textbackslash}\% at \${\textbar}e{\textbar} B {\textbackslash}sim 1{\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}rm {GeV}\}{\textasciicircum}2\$ and would suggest, if extrapolated to larger fields, a vanishing string tension along the magnetic field for \${\textbar}e{\textbar} B {\textbackslash}gtrsim 4\$ {GeV}\${\textasciicircum}2\$. The angular dependence for \${\textbar}e{\textbar} B {\textbackslash}lesssim 1\$ {GeV}\${\textasciicircum}2\$ can be nicely parametrized by the first allowed term in an angular Fourier expansion, corresponding to a quadrupole deformation. Finally, for \$T {\textbackslash}neq 0\$, the main effect of the magnetic field is a general suppression of the string tension, leading to a precocious loss of the confining properties: this happens even before the appearance of inverse magnetic catalysis in the chiral condensate, supporting the idea that the influence of the magnetic field on the confining properties is the leading effect originating the decrease of \$T\_c\$ as a function of \$B\$.},

          , 
            Smart surfaces with switchable wettability for both aqueous and non-aqueous drops based on zwitterionic sulfobetaine silane ({SBSi}) have been fabricated. The wettability transition occurs from a total wetting (contact angle, {CA} ≈ 0°) to a partial wetting ({CA} as high as ∼75°) state. A surfactant solution (aqueous or non-aqueous) rinse (for 5 s) acts as a stimulus and the reversal of surface wettability is achieved simply by a pure water rinse. The reversible behavior of the switchable wettability of a {SBSi} surface can be observed for at least 100 cycles. Various cationic surfactants are used as stimuli for aqueous drops and anionic surfactants are employed for non-aqueous drops. This unique wettability-switching property is attributed to basal surfactant adsorption driven by electrostatic attractions between the charged surfactant head groups and zwitterionic groups of {SBSi}. Such rapid surfactant adsorption is also responsible for intriguing drop fission and dewetting phenomena, shown by stimulus drops cast on clean {SBSi} surfaces. Thus, this smart switchable wettability surface can be employed to fabricate intelligent devices for controlling mobility and sensing.},

          , 
            
              The influence of the branching patterns on the membrane properties of Janus dendrimers in water has been investigated by dissipative particle dynamics simulations. The hydrophobic fluorinated dendron (R
              F
              ) contains three types of branching patterns, including 3,4-, 3,5-, and 3,4,5-R
              F
              . Consistent with experimental results, the hydrophobic layer thickness (
              H
              B
              ) follows the order: 3,5-R
              F
              {\textless} 3,4-R
              F
              {\textless} 3,4,5-R
              F
              , which can be explained by the extent of interdigitation (Δ
              h
              ): 3,5-R
              F
              {\textgreater} 3,4-R
              F
              {\textgreater} 3,4,5-R
              F
              . Moreover, the 3,4,5-R
              F
              membrane shows the highest stretching modulus (
              K
              A
              ) and the lowest lateral diffusivity (
              D
              ). The 3,5-R
              F
              membrane is similar to the 3,4-R
              F
              membrane but exhibits a higher
              K
              A
              and smaller
              D
              . For the nano-sized dendrimersome, its bilayer thickness is less than that of the planar membrane due to its larger extent of interdigitation. The co-assembly of dendrimersomes with lipids has been studied as well. The thickness and the extent of interdigitation of the lipid-rich domain for the hybrid membrane are significantly affected by the lipid concentration (
              ϕ
              l
              ) and the branching patterns. As
              ϕ
              l
              increases, the thickness of the lipid-rich domain grows corresponding to the decrease of interdigitation of the lipid-rich domain.},

              The mechanical pressure, surface excess, and polar order of a dilute rod-like nanoswimmer suspension confined by two parallel plates are explored by dissipative particle dynamics.

	abstract = {The active diffusion and sedimentation equilibrium of rod-like nanoswimmers with length L are investigated by dissipative particle dynamics. In the absence of propulsion, the nanorod has the rotational correlation time τθ and mobility μ0, which vary with L. On the basis of the mean squared displacement, the diffusive behavior of rod-like nanoswimmers subject to active force Fa is found to follow (D − D0) ∝ (μ0Fa)2τθ, where D0 depicts the Brownian diffusivity. When the nanoswimmer suspension is under the external force Fe, the balance between the downward migration and upward active diffusion yields the sedimentation length δ = D/(μ0Fe), which no longer obeys δ0 = {kBT}/Fe obtained from the Einstein–Smoluchowski relationship, D0 = μ0kBT. Different from the suspension of passive rods, the polar order is clearly seen for active rods. The local polar order is essentially constant within the distance of about 2δ from the bottom wall but decays as the distance is further increased. In this work, the active Peclet number is small compared to unity and the maximum polar order grows linearly with Fe/Fa. The polar order arises because it is easier for the nanoswimmer with the swimming direction opposite to the external force to escape from the bottom wall.},

	title = {The Physics of Active Matter - {KITP} Colloquium by Cristina Marchetti},
	url = {https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4tx9SVZznQ},
	abstract = {Assemblies of interacting self-driven entities form soft active materials with intriguing collective behavior and mechanical properties. Examples abound in nature on many scales, from the flocking of birds to cell migration in morphogenesis. They also include synthetic systems, from engineered microswimmers to self-catalytic colloids and autonomously propelled liquid crystals.  What unifies these systems is that they are driven out of equilibrium by dissipative processes that act on each individual particle, hence break the time reversal symmetry of the dynamics at the microscale. This results in surprising behavior. For instance, active fluids flow with no externally applied driving forces, active gases do not fill their container, and active particles spontaneously organize when passive ones would not. Since time reversal symmetry of the microdynamics and the associated detailed balance of forward and reverse processes are built into the foundation of equilibrium statistical physics, the description of active systems poses a new theoretical challenge. 

In this talk I will discuss the physics of active matter with examples from both the living and non-living worlds. I will show that by combining minimal physical models with continuum theory and simulations we are making advances towards capturing quantitatively the laws of spontaneous organization of active systems.  This theoretical progress has implication for both formulating design principles for new smart materials and understanding cellular and multicellular organization.

We then take ﬂuctuations into account and provide a mesoscopic description of the system based on the stochastic mean ﬁeld Smoluchowski equation. We establish the main properties of this equation and derive the Kramers escape rate formula, giving the lifetime of a metastable state, from the theory of instantons. We relate the properties of the generalized stochastic Smoluchowski equation to a principle of maximum dissipation of free energy. We also discuss the connection with the dynamical density functional theory of simple liquids.},

In both ensembles, the hydrodynamic eﬀect on the suspension mediated by the presence of the conﬁning wall is implemented in a mean-ﬁeld fashion by incorporating the thermodynamic work done by the inertial lift force on the particle given the average ﬂow ﬁeld. The predicted particle distribution in the μ{VT} ensemble displays strong structural ordering at increasing ﬂow rates due to the correspondingly higher particle concentrations inside the cylinder. In the {NVT} ensemble, for dilute suspensions we observe a peak in the distribution of density at a location similar to that of the Segre-́ Silberberg annulus, while for dense suspensions the competing eﬀects of the inertial lift and the hardsphere interaction lead to the formation of several annuli.},

	abstract = {Cracks, the major vehicle for material failure, tend to accelerate to high velocities in brittle materials. In three-dimensions, cracks generically undergo a micro-branching instability at about 40\% of their sonic limiting velocity. Recent experiments showed that in sufficiently thin systems cracks unprecedentedly accelerate to nearly their limiting velocity without micro-branching, until they undergo an oscillatory instability. Despite their fundamental importance and apparent similarities to other instabilities in condensed-matter physics and materials science, these dynamic fracture instabilities remain poorly understood. They are not described by the classical theory of cracks, which assumes that linear elasticity is valid inside a stressed material and uses an extraneous local symmetry criterion to predict crack paths. Here we develop a model of two-dimensional dynamic brittle fracture capable of predicting arbitrary paths of ultra-high-speed cracks in the presence of elastic nonlinearity without extraneous criteria. We show, by extensive computations, that cracks undergo a dynamic oscillatory instability controlled by small-scale elastic nonlinearity near the crack tip. This instability occurs above a ultra-high critical velocity and features an intrinsic wavelength that increases proportionally to the ratio of the fracture energy to an elastic modulus, in quantitative agreement with experiments. This ratio emerges as a fundamental scaling length assumed to play no role in the classical theory of cracks, but shown here to strongly influence crack dynamics. Those results pave the way for resolving other long-standing puzzles in the failure of materials.},

	abstract = {A hologram is an image that appears to be three dimensional and which can be seen with the naked eye. Holography is the science and practice of making holograms. Typically, a hologram is a photographic recording of a light field, rather than an image formed by a lens. The holographic medium, i.e., the object produced by a holographic process (which itself may be referred to as a hologram) is usually unintelligible when viewed under diffuse ambient light. It is an encoding of the light field as an interference pattern of variations in the opacity, density, or surface profile of the photographic medium. When suitably lit, the interference pattern diffracts the light into an accurate reproduction of the original light field, and the objects that were in it exhibit visual depth cues such as parallax and perspective that change realistically with the relative position of the observer. That is, the view of the image from different angles represents the subject viewed from similar angles.
In its pure form, holography requires the use of laser light for illuminating the subject and for viewing the finished hologram. A microscopic level of detail throughout the recorded scene can be reproduced. In common practice, however, major image quality compromises are made to eliminate the need for laser illumination to view the hologram, and in some cases, to make it. Holographic portraiture often resorts to a non-holographic intermediate imaging procedure, to avoid the hazardous high-powered pulsed lasers otherwise needed to optically "freeze" moving subjects as perfectly as the extremely motion-intolerant holographic recording process requires. Holograms can now also be entirely computer-generated to show objects or scenes that never existed.
Holography is distinct from lenticular and other earlier autostereoscopic 3D display technologies, which can produce superficially similar results but are based on conventional lens imaging. Images requiring the aid of special glasses or other intermediate optics, stage illusions such as Pepper's Ghost and other unusual, baffling, or seemingly magical images are often incorrectly called holograms.},

	abstract = {In geometry, parallel transport is a way of transporting geometrical data along smooth curves in a manifold.  If the manifold is equipped with an affine connection (a covariant derivative or connection on the tangent bundle), then this connection allows one to transport vectors of the manifold along curves so that they stay parallel with respect to the connection.
The parallel transport for a connection thus supplies a way of, in some sense, moving the local geometry of a manifold along a curve: that is, of connecting the geometries of nearby points.  There may be many notions of parallel transport available, but a specification of one — one way of connecting up the geometries of points on a curve — is tantamount to providing a connection.  In fact, the usual notion of connection is the infinitesimal analog of parallel transport.  Or, vice versa, parallel transport is the local realization of a connection.
As parallel transport supplies a local realization of the connection, it also supplies a local realization of the curvature known as holonomy.  The Ambrose-Singer theorem makes explicit this relationship between curvature and holonomy.
Other notions of connection come equipped with their own parallel transportation systems as well. For instance, a Koszul connection in a vector bundle also allows for the parallel transport of vectors in much the same way as with a covariant derivative.  An Ehresmann or Cartan connection supplies a lifting of curves from the manifold to the total space of a principal bundle.  Such curve lifting may sometimes be thought of as the parallel transport of reference frames.},

Although these quantum effects violate the classical law that the area of the event horizon of a black hole cannot decrease, there remains a Generalized Second Law:S+1/4A never decreases {whereS} is the entropy of matter outside black holes {andA} is the sum of the surface areas of the event horizons. This shows that gravitational collapse converts the baryons and leptons in the collapsing body into entropy.

For comparison, we also explore f2 -{\textgreater} pi pi, which because of its sensitivity to the {UV} corrections has much more uncertainty.

	abstract = {Chiral and deconfinement phase transitions at finite temperature \$T\$ and quark number chemical potential \${\textbackslash}mu\$ are simultaneously studied in the quenched dynamical holographic {QCD} model within the Einstein-Dilaton-Maxwell framework. By calculating the corresponding order parameters, i.e., the chiral condensate and Polyakov loop, it is shown that the transition lines of these two phase transitions are separated in the \$T-{\textbackslash}mu \$ plane. The deconfinement phase transition is shown to be always of crossover type and the transition line depends weakly on the baryon number density. Differently, the chiral transition is of crossover at small baryon number density and it turns to be of first order at sufficient large baryon number density. A critical endpoint ({CEP}), at which the transition becomes second order type, appears in the chiral transition line. This is the first time to realize the {CEP} of chiral phase transition in the (T,\${\textbackslash}mu\$) plane in the framework of dynamical holographic {QCD} model. It is observed that between these two phase transition lines, there is a region with chiral symmetry restored and color degrees still confined, which could be considered as the quarkyonic phase. Qualitatively, this behavior is in consistent with the result in the Polyakov-loop improved Nambu-Jona-Lasinio ({PNJL}) model.},

	abstract = {We present new anisotropic black brane solutions in 5D Einstein-dilaton-two-Maxwell system. The anisotropic background is specified by an arbitrary dynamical exponent ν, a nontrivial warp factor, a non-zero dilaton field, a non-zero time component of the first Maxwell field and a non-zero longitudinal magnetic component of the second Maxwell field. The blackening function supports the Van der Waals-like phase transition between small and large black holes for a suitable first Maxwell field charge. The isotropic case corresponding to ν = 1 and zero magnetic field reproduces previously known solutions. We investigate the anisotropy influence on the thermodynamic properties of our background, in particular, on the small/large black holes phase transition diagram.We discuss applications of the model to the bottom-up holographic {QCD}. The {RG} flow interpolates between the {UV} section with two suppressed transversal coordinates and the {IR} section with the suppressed time and longitudinal coordinates due to anisotropic character of our solution. We study the temporal Wilson loops, extended in longitudinal and transversal directions, by calculating the minimal surfaces of the corresponding probing open string world-sheet in anisotropic backgrounds with various temperatures and chemical potentials. We find that dynamical wall locations depend on the orientation of the quark pairs, that gives a crossover transition line between confinement/deconfinement phases in the dual gauge theory. Instability of the background leads to the appearance of the critical points (μϑ,b, Tϑ,b) depending on the orientation ϑ of quark-antiquark pairs in respect to the heavy ions collision line.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we study the influence of an external magnetic field in holographic {QCD} models where the backreaction is modeled in via an appropriate choice of the background metric. We add a phenomenological soft wall dilaton to incorporate better {IR} behavior (confinement). Elaborating on previous studies conducted by [{JHEP} 1505 (2015) 121], we first discuss the Hawking-Page transition, the dual of the deconfinement transition, as a function of the magnetic field. We confirm that the critical deconfinement temperature can drop with the magnetic field. Secondly, we study the quark condensate holographically as a function of the applied magnetic field and demonstrate that this model does not exhibit inverse magnetic catalysis at the level of the chiral transition. The quest for a holographic {QCD} model that qualitatively describes the inverse magnetic catalysis at finite temperature is thus still open. Throughout this work, we pay special attention to the different holographic parameters and we attempt to fix them by making the link to genuine {QCD} as close as possible. This leads to several unanticipated and so far overlooked complications (such as the relevance of an additional length scale in the confined geometry) that we discuss in detail.},

We now discuss how these features leave their imprints on the associated entanglement entropy when a strip region is introduced in the various phases. We uncover an even so rich structure in the entanglement entropy, consistent with the thermodynamical transitions, while again uncloaking some subtleties. Thanks to the temperature dependent confining geometry, we can present an original quantitative prediction for the phase diagram in terms of temperature and strip length, reporting a critical end point at the deconfinement temperature.

The holographic principle emerged from many subtle clues – clues discovered over decades of theoretical exploration of the universe. Over the past several months on Space Time, we’ve seen those close clues, and we’ve built a the foundations needed to glimpse the true meaning of the holographic principle. We’ve moved from quantum field theory to black hole thermodynamics to string theory. We’ve made a background playlist if you want to start from scratch, and I especially recommend catching last week’s episode. But this is tough material, so let’s do a review.

In fact, the dimensionless ratio of these two quantities comes out within the current experimental bound. The result for this ratio depends only on Nc and Nf, and the quark and glueball content of the operator responsible for the f2; more importantly, it does not depend on chiral symmetry breaking and so is both independent of much of the arbitrariness of {AdS}/{QCD} and completely out of reach of chiral perturbation theory. For comparison, we also explore f2 -{\textgreater} pi pi, which because of its sensitivity to the {UV} corrections has much more uncertainty. We also calculate the masses of the higher spin resonances on the Regge trajectory of the f2, and find they compare favorably with experiment.},

In particular, we consider a D7-brane probe in both the {AdS} Schwarzschild black hole solution and in the background found by Constable and Myers, which involves a nonconstant dilaton and S5 radius. Both these backgrounds exhibit confinement of fundamental matter and a discrete glueball and meson spectrum. We numerically compute the ¯ΨΨ condensate and meson spectrum associated with these backgrounds. In the {AdS}–black-hole background, a quark-bilinear condensate develops only at a nonzero quark mass. We speculate on the existence of a third order phase transition at a critical quark mass where the D7 embedding undergoes a geometric transition. In the Constable-Myers background, we find a chiral symmetry breaking condensate as well as the associated Goldstone boson in the limit of small quark mass. The existence of the condensate ensures that the D7-brane never reaches the naked singularity at the origin of the deformed {AdS} space.},

Flavors therefore should be represented by space-time filling D-branes in the dual 5d closed string background. This requires several interesting properties of D-branes in {AdS}. D-branes have to be able to end in thin air in order to account for massive quarks, which only live in the {UV} region. They must come in distinct sets, representing the chiral global symmetry, with a bifundamental field playing the role of the chiral condensate. We show that these expectations are born out in several supersymmetric examples. To analyze most of these properties it is not necessary to go beyond the probe limit in which one neglects the backreaction of the flavor D-branes.},

	abstract = {We show that the large \$N\$ limit of certain conformal field theories in various dimensions include in their Hilbert space a sector describing supergravity on the product of Anti-{deSitter} spacetimes, spheres and other compact manifolds. This is shown by taking some branes in the full M/string theory and then taking a low energy limit where the field theory on the brane decouples from the bulk. We observe that, in this limit, we can still trust the near horizon geometry for large \$N\$. The enhanced supersymmetries of the near horizon geometry correspond to the extra supersymmetry generators present in the superconformal group (as opposed to just the super-Poincare group). The 't Hooft limit of 4-d \$\{{\textbackslash}cal N\} =4\$ super-Yang-Mills at the conformal point is shown to contain strings: they are {IIB} strings. We conjecture that compactifications of M/string theory on various Anti-{deSitter} spacetimes are dual to various conformal field theories. This leads to a new proposal for a definition of M-theory which could be extended to include five non-compact dimensions.},

	title = {Negative dissipation and instability in systems with distributed delay},
	abstract = {Many natural and artiﬁcial systems are subject to some sort of delay, which can be in the form of a single discrete delay or distributed over a range of times. Here, we discuss the impact of this distribution on (thermo-)dynamical properties of time-delayed stochastic systems. To this end, we study a simple classical model with white and colored noise, and focus on the class of Gamma-distributed delays which includes a variety of distinct delay distributions typical for feedback experiments and biological systems. A physical application is a colloid subject to time-delayed feedback control, which is, in principle, experimentally realizable by co-moving optical traps. We uncover several unexpected phenomena in regard to the system’s linear stability and its thermodynamic properties. First, increasing the mean delay time can destabilize, or stabilize the process, depending on the distribution of the delay. Second, for all considered distributions, the heat dissipation of the controlled system (e.g., the colloidal particle) can become negative, which implies that the delay force extracts energy of the heat bath. This refrigerating eﬀect is particularly pronounced for exponential delay. For a speciﬁc non-reciprocal realization of a control device, we ﬁnd that the entropic costs, measured by the total entropy production of the system plus controller, are the lowest for exponential delay. The exponential delay further yields the largest stable parameter regions. In this sense, exponential delay represents the most eﬀective and robust type of delayed feedback.},

  Thus under certain conditions, one may interchange the integral and partial differential operators. This important result is particularly useful in the differentiation of integral transforms. An example of such is the moment generating function in  probability theory, a variation of the Laplace transform, which can be differentiated to generate the moments of a random variable. Whether Leibniz's integral rule applies is essentially a question about the interchange of limits.},

The explanation stands upon a closer analysis of the effect of the terms of the complete stress tensor in which the viscosity coefficients appear. An alternative formulation of the hypothesis is proposed, which also permits to clearly identify the very particular flow conditions in which it cannot justify the experimental evidence.},

Its success and the great advances that have taken place in the ensuing years have made this new edition both welcome and necessary. New chapters describe the main types and properties of liquid crystals in terms of the new phases discovered since the middle of the 1970s, and advances in the understanding of local order and the nature of isotropic to nematic transition. There is an extensive discussion of the symmetry, and macroscopic and dynamic properties of smectics and columnar phases, and their defects, illustrated with numerous descriptions of experimental arrangements. The final chapter is devoted to phase transitions in smectics, including the celebrated analogy between Smectic A and superconductors. Throughout the book there is an emphasis on order-of-magnitude considerations. Its topicality and breadth of coverage will ensure that The Physics of Liquid Crystals remains an indispensable guide for students and researchers alike.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to provide an introduction to a basic form of the \$\{{\textbackslash}bf Q\}\$-tensor approach to modelling liquid crystals, which has seen increased interest in recent years. The increase in interest in this type of modelling approach has been driven by investigations into the fundamental nature of defects and new applications of liquid crystals such as bistable displays and colloidal systems for which a description of defects and disorder is essential. The work in this paper is not new research, rather it is an introductory guide for anyone wishing to model a system using such a theory. A more complete mathematical description of this theory, including a description of flow effects, can be found in numerous sources but the books by Virga and Sonnet and Virga are recommended. More information can be obtained from the plethora of papers using such approaches, although a general introduction for the novice is lacking. The first few sections of this paper will detail the development of the \$\{{\textbackslash}bf Q\}\$-tensor approach for nematic liquid crystalline systems and construct the free energy and governing equations for the mesoscopic dependent variables. A number of device surface treatments are considered and theoretical boundary conditions are specified for each instance. Finally, an example of a real device is demonstrated.},

Dense populations of such “active particles” or “swimmers” exhibit a rich collective behavior at large scales. Starting with a minimal physical model of a stroke-averaged swimmer in a fluid, we derive a continuum description of a suspension of active organisms that incorporates fluid-mediated, long-range hydrodynamic interactions among the swimmers. Our work demonstrates that hydrodynamic interactions provide a simple, generic origin for several nonequilibrium phenomena predicted or observed in the literature. The continuum model derived here does not depend on the microscopic physical model of the individual swimmer. The details of the large-scale physics do, however, differ for “shakers” (particles that are active but not self-propelled, such as melanocytes) and “movers” (self-propelled particles), “pushers” (most bacteria) and “pullers” (algae like Chlamydomonas). Our work provides a classification of the large-scale behavior of all these systems.},

A common requirement for such algorithms is that interactions in the system should vary little during an integration time step: therefore, computational efficiency worsens as the interactions become steeper. In the extreme case of hard-body interactions, standard numerical integrators become ill defined. Several approximate schemes have been invented to handle such cases with little emphasis on testing the correctness of the integration scheme. Starting from the two-body Smoluchowsky equation, we discuss a general method for the overdamped Brownian dynamics of hard-spheres, recently developed by one of us. We test the accuracy of the algorithm with the exact solution of the Smoluchowsky equation in the case of twobody collisions and in the low-density limit.},

	abstract = {We measured the velocity field caused by thermo-osmosis due to a heated {AuNP} fixed at the surface of a glass slide. The inferred interfacial flow velocities reach values of up to 300 μm=s and set up a parabolic flow field in the water film at large distances from the heat source. The slip velocities are found to be much stronger at interfaces covered with nonionic block-copolymers as compared to bare charged glass interfaces. The good agreement of the numbers gathered in Table 1 leads us to the conclusion that the slip velocity on a Pluronic-coated surface is driven by thermo-osmosis on the {PEG}-water interface. More generally, they confirm the role of the interaction enthalpy for the thermal separation of molecular mixtures [41] and suggest that simple models such as Eq. (4) provide a good description for the Soret data of polymers. Regarding the thermo-osmosis on a glass surface, our findings differ from previous results. The discrepancy probably results from additional contributions to the excess enthalpy, such as structuration of water or rearrangement of the hydrogen bond network, as discussed in Ref. [33]. Our results further suggest that thermoosmotic flows along solid-liquid interfaces may contribute considerably to thermophoretic measurements in thin film geometries and may be harnessed for microfluidic applications.},

We discuss different transport mechanisms for charged colloids, and how a thermal gradient gives rise to companion fields. Particular emphasis is put on the thermal response of the electrolyte solution: Positive and negative ions diffuse along the temperature gradient and thus induce a thermoelectric field which in turn acts on the colloidal charges. Regarding polymers in organic solvents, the physical mechanism changes with decreasing molecular weight: High polymers are described in the framework of macroscopic hydrodynamics, for short chains and molecular mixtures of similar size, the Brownian motion of solute and solvent becomes important.},

	abstract = {Differently from passive Brownian particles, active particles, also known as self-propelled Brownian particles or microswimmers and nanoswimmers, are capable of taking up energy from their environment and converting it into directed motion. Because of this constant flow of energy, their behavior can be explained and understood only within the framework of nonequilibrium physics. In the biological realm, many cells perform directed motion, for example, as a way to browse for nutrients or to avoid toxins. Inspired by these motile microorganisms, researchers have been developing artificial particles that feature similar swimming behaviors based on different mechanisms. These man-made micromachines and nanomachines hold a great potential as autonomous agents for health care, sustainability, and security applications. With a focus on the basic physical features of the interactions of self-propelled Brownian particles with a crowded and complex environment, this comprehensive review will provide a guided tour through its basic principles, the development of artificial self-propelling microparticles and nanoparticles, and their application to the study of nonequilibrium phenomena, as well as the open challenges that the field is currently facing.},

	abstract = {We investigate active Brownian heat engines consisting of a Brownian particle confined in a modulated harmonic potential and immersed in a non-equilibrium bath of variable activity. We show that their average energetics determined by the second moment of the particle position can be mapped onto that of a model with a passive equilibrium bath at a suitably defined time-dependent effective temperature. Formal limitations for the thermodynamic performance, including maximum efficiency, efficiency at maximum power, and maximum efficiency at fixed power ensue. They help to clarify the degree to which such active heat engines can outperform passive-bath designs, which has been a debated issue for recent experimental realizations. And they can guide the design of new micro-machines. To illustrate the general principles, we analyze a specific realization of an active heat engine based on the paradigmatic Active Brownian Particle ({ABP}) model. Explicit analytical and numerical results are provided and discussed for quasi-static and finite-rate protocols. They reveal some non-intuitive features of the dynamical effective temperature, which complicate the implementation of classical cycles (like Carnot or Stirling) with active baths, illustrate various conceptual and practical limitations of the effective-equilibrium mapping, and clarify the operational relevance of various coarse-grained measures of dissipation.},

It is observed that the rotational component of a flow-field, which characterizes the degree of irreversibility of the stochastic dynamics, does not explicitly appear in the equation that quantifies the rate of system entropy production. The residence time of a particle in an arbitrary neighborhood of a flow field is characterized in terms of the flow properties. This information is important when the flow transports vital signaling molecules necessary for system function.

Competing hypotheses have been proposed: the direction of flow is sensed either through mechanosensation, or via the detection of chemical signals transported in the flow. We investigated the physical limits of flow detection to clarify which mechanisms could be reliably used for symmetry breaking. We integrated parameters describing cilia distribution and orientation obtained in vivo in zebrafish into a multiscale physical study of flow generation and detection. Our results show that the number of immotile cilia is too small to ensure robust left and right determination by mechanosensing, given the large spatial variability of the flow. However, motile cilia could sense their own motion by a yet unknown mechanism. Finally, transport of chemical signals by the flow can provide a simple and reliable mechanism of asymmetry establishment.},

Here we show that by modifying the surface with a protein-repellent functionalization and using clusters of kinesin motors, the microtubule can exhibit persistent oscillatory motion resembling the beating of sperm flagella. The observed period is of the order of 1 min. From the experimental images we theoretically determine a distribution of motor forces that explains the observed shapes using a maximum likelihood approach. A good agreement is achieved with a small number of motor clusters acting simultaneously on a microtubule. The tangential forces exerted by a cluster are mostly in the range 0–8 {pN} toward the microtubule minus end, indicating the action of 1 or 2 kinesin motors. The lateral forces are distributed symmetrically and mainly below 10 {pN}, while the lateral velocity has a strong peak around zero. Unlike well-known models for flapping filaments, kinesins are found to have a strong “pinning” effect on the beating filaments. Our results suggest new strategies to utilize molecular motors in dynamic roles that depend sensitively on the stress built-up in the system.},

	abstract = {No matter how well we understand how a single drop of water, in the laboratory, is formed, we cannot predict how countless droplets, in the atmosphere, form clouds that substantially affect the Earth’s climate. And although we can exactly characterise a single neuron’s impulse, we do not yet understand how billions of them form a single thought. In such systems, animate or inanimate, processes of self-organisation are at work: Many interacting parts that organise themselves independently, without external control, into a complex whole. At our institute, we explore the underlying mechanisms of these interactions, in order to gain a detailed understanding of complex systems. The major challenges of the 21st century, from climate change and economic crises to problems in energy supply and transport, are closely linked to these scientific questions. Without a deep understanding of dynamics and self-organisation in complex and highly networked systems, we can barely begin to face these challenges. With our basic research, we not only want to deepen our understanding of nature, but also contribute to our sustainable existence on this planet.

Brief overview of the area of self-organization theory 




Transcription:
If a system, such as a plant, a building or a car, shows organization we tend to assume that someone or something must have design in that particular order. Self-organization is the idea that this type of global coordination can instead be the product of local interactions.

The theory of self-organization has grown out of many different areas from computer science to ecology and economics. Out of these areas have emerged a core set of concepts that are designed to be applicable to all self-organizing systems from galaxies to living cells. But Lets start by talking a bit about Organization itself.

Organization is a highly abstract concept but we can loosely equate it to the idea of order with its opposite being what is called entropy or disorder. Order and entropy are typically measured by scientist in terms of information, that is the more information it takes to describe something the more disordered the systems is said to be.

An example of this might be a piece of metallic substance consisting of tiny magnets called spins, each spin has an particular magnetic orientation and in general they are randomly directed and thus cancel each other out, This disordered configuration is due to its heat energy causing the random movements of the molecules in the material.

When we cool the material down the spins will spontaneously align them self so that they all point in the same direction. To describe the state of the spins in this order system would involve far less information relative to it's original state that requiring unique values for each randomly directed spin.

This process of magnetisation is often cited as an example of self-organization, that is the spontaneous appearance of order or global coordination out of local level interactions. But lets take a closer look at how this happens.

As we cooled the material down there was some area that had by chance some spins pointing in the same direction, their alignment generated an increased magnetic force that was exerted upon its neighbours, creating what is called an attractor state, attracting other spins to this configuration.

Each time another spin aligned itself with this particular attractor state it augmented the force it exerted upon other spins through what is called a positive feedback loop that would cascade through the system until all elements were aligned within this new regime.

Another example of self-organization through positive feedback is what is called the network effect, where the more people that use a product or service the greater its value becomes, the telephone and Facebook are such examples becoming more useful as more users join, in this way local connections between individuals can rapidly form into global patterns.

The network effect illustrate the positive relations or synergies between elements that can be created when they coordinate, it is due to the presence of these synergistic relations that the system as an entirety can become more than the sum of its parts, in a process called emergence.

Ant colonies are a classical example given of emergence, ants governed by very simple rules and only local interactions can through their combined activities generate colonies that exhibit complex structures and behaviour that far exceed the intelligence or capability of any individual ant and thus is said to have emergent properties.

Ant colonies also illustrate the decentralised structure to self-organizing system, The queen does not tell the ants what to do, instead each ant reacts to stimuli in the form of chemical scent exchanged with other ants, in this way organization is distributed over the whole of the system. All parts contribute evenly to the resulting arrangement.

As opposed to centralized structure such as most social organization that are often dependent upon a single coordinator, this decentralized structure that is inherent to self-organized systems gives them resiliency and robustness, as any element that is damaged can be simple replace by any other given them hug redundancy....

              physical simulations, and derive asymptotic scaling relations of the elastic modulus with the stress in the context of an affine theory.
            
          , 
            
              Disordered filamentous networks with compliant crosslinks exhibit a low linear elastic shear modulus at small strains, but stiffen dramatically at high strains. Experiments have shown that the elastic modulus can increase by up to three orders of magnitude while the networks withstand relatively large stresses without rupturing. Here, we perform an analytical and numerical study on model networks in three dimensions. Our model consists of a collection of randomly oriented rigid filaments connected by flexible crosslinks that are modeled as wormlike chains. Due to zero probability of filament intersection in three dimensions, our model networks are by construction prestressed in terms of initial tension in the crosslinks. We demonstrate how the linear elastic modulus can be related to the prestress in these networks. Under the assumption of affine deformations in the limit of
              infinite
              crosslink density, we show analytically that the nonlinear elastic regime in 1- and 2-dimensional networks is characterized by power-law scaling of the elastic modulus with the stress. In contrast, 3-dimensional networks show an exponential dependence of the modulus on stress. Independent of dimensionality, if the crosslink density is
              finite
              , we show that the only persistent scaling exponent is that of the single wormlike chain. We further show that there is no qualitative change in the stiffening behavior of filamentous networks even if the filaments are bending-compliant. Consequently, unlike suggested in prior work, the model system studied here cannot provide an explanation for the experimentally observed linear scaling of the modulus with the stress in filamentous networks.},

Flavors therefore should be represented by space-time filling D-branes in the dual 5d closed string background. This requires several interesting properties of D-branes in {AdS}. D-branes have to be able to end in thin air in order to account for massive quarks, which only live in the {UV} region. They must come in distinct sets, representing the chiral global symmetry, with a bifundamental field playing the role of the chiral condensate. We show that these expectations are born out in several supersymmetric examples. To analyze most of these properties it is not necessary to go beyond the probe limit in which one neglects the backreaction of the flavor D-branes.},

The first six chapters give an introduction to supersymmetry in four spacetime dimensions, they fill about two thirds of the lecture notes and are in principle self-contained. The remaining two chapters are devoted to extra spacetime dimensions which are in the end combined with the concept of supersymmetry.

In particular we introduce a novel model that still captures well the {QCD} confinement and deconfinement phases, while allowing the introduction of a temperature in a phase which resembles the confined phase, this thanks to it being dual to a small black hole. We pay due attention to some subtleties of such model. We confirm the lattice picture of a strong build-up of thermal entropy towards the critical temperature T\_c, both coming from below or above T\_c. We also include a chemical potential, confirming this entropic picture and we consider its effect on the speed of sound. Moreover, the temperature dependent confinement phase from the holography side allows us to find a string tension that does not vanish at T\_c, a finding also supported by lattice {QCD}.},

In this framework we observe an area law for spatial Wilson loops in four and ﬁve dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills at ﬁnite temperature. This can be interpreted as the area law of ordinary Wilson loops in three and four dimensional non-supersymmetric gauge theories at zero temperature which indicates conﬁnement in these theories. Furthermore, we show that super Yang Mills theories with 16 supersymmetries at ﬁnite temperature do not admit phase transitions between the weakly coupled super Yang Mills and supergravity regimes. This result is derived by analyzing the entropy and speciﬁc heat of those systems as well as by computing ordinary Wilson loops at ﬁnite temperature.

In this description, quantum phenomena such as the spontaneous breaking of the center of the gauge group, magnetic confinement, and the mass gap are coded in classical geometry. The correspondence makes it manifest that the entropy of a very large \${AdS}\$ Schwarzschild black hole must scale ``holographically'' with the volume of its horizon.

The word "confinement" in the context of hadronic physics originally referred to the fact that quarks and gluons appear to be trapped inside mesons and baryons, from which they cannot escape. There are other, and possibly deeper meanings that can be attached to the term, and these will be explored in this book. Although the confinement problem is far from solved, much is now known about the general features of the confining force, and there are a number of very well motivated theories of confinement which are under active investigation. This volume gives a both pedagogical and concise introduction and overview of the main ideas in this field, their attractive features, and, as appropriate, their shortcomings.--P. 4 of cover},

In this framework we observe an area law for spatial Wilson loops in four and ﬁve dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills at ﬁnite temperature. This can be interpreted as the area law of ordinary Wilson loops in three and four dimensional non-supersymmetric gauge theories at zero temperature which indicates conﬁnement in these theories. Furthermore, we show that super Yang Mills theories with 16 supersymmetries at ﬁnite temperature do not admit phase transitions between the weakly coupled super Yang Mills and supergravity regimes. This result is derived by analyzing the entropy and speciﬁc heat of those systems as well as by computing ordinary Wilson loops at ﬁnite temperature. The calculation of the entropy was carried out in all diﬀerent regimes and indicates that there is no ﬁrst order phase transition in these systems.

The potential exhibits finite temperature scaling consistent with underlying conformal invariance.

To put the {AdS}/{CFT} correspondence in historical context, we start by reviewing the relevant aspects of string theory (of which no prior knowledge is assumed). We then develop the statement of the correspondence, and explain how the two sides of the duality map into each other. Finally, we discuss the implications and applications of the correspondence, and indicate some of the current trends in this subject.

The Hawking-Page transition and the deconfinement transition in weakly coupled gauge theories are briefly reviewed. Emphasis is on the study of 't Hooft-Feynman diagrams in the large \$N\$ gauge theories, which are supposed to describe closed string worldsheets and probe the above equivalence. Nature of the 't Hooft-Feynman diagrams at finite temperature is analyzed, both in the Euclidean signature (the imaginary time formalism) and in the Lorentzian signature (the real time formalism).

At ﬁnite temperature the 5-brane probe action is minimized when the probe falls to the horizon, although metastable minima with r {\textgreater}{\textgreater} {rH} persist for a range of temperatures. Thermal eﬀects on the 3-form source for the hypermultiplet mass m and its order m2 back reaction on the other ﬁelds of the {IIB} theory are computed. We ﬁnd unique solutions which are regular at the horizon and have the correct behavior on the boundary. For ﬁxed temperature T , the horizon shrinks for increasing m2 suggesting that there is a critical temperature separating the system into high and low temperature phases. In the high temperature phase 5-branes are unnnecessary since there are no naked singularities. Using the order m2 correction to the horizon area we calculate the entropy change to be ∆S = −.6854m2T , which is 91\% of the free ﬁeld result.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9908171},
	abstract = {This dissertation reviews various aspects of the N=4 supersymmetric Yang--Mills theory in particular in relation with the {AdS}/{CFT} correspondence. The first two chapters are introductory. The first one contains a description of the general properties of rigid supersymmetric theories in four dimensions both at the classical and at the quantum level. The second chapter is a review of the main properties of the N=4 {SYM} theory under consideration. Original results are reported in chapters 3, 4 and 5. A systematic re-analysis of the perturbative properties of the theory is presented in the third chapter. Two-, three- and four-point Green functions of elementary fields are computed using the component formulation and/or the superfield approach and subtleties related to the gauge-fixing are pointed out. In the fourth chapter, after an introduction to instanton calculus in supersymmetric gauge theories, the computation of the one-instanton contributions to Green functions of gauge invariant composite operators in the semiclassical approximation is reported. The calculations of four-, eight- and sixteen-point Green functions of operators in the supercurrent multiplet are reviewed in detail. The final chapter is devoted to the {AdS}/{SCFT} correspondence. Some general aspects are discussed. Then the attention is focused on the relation between instantons in N=4 {SYM} and D-instanton effects in type {IIB} string theory. The comparison between instanton contributions to Green functions of composite operators in the boundary field theory and D-instanton generated terms in the amplitudes computed in type {IIB} string theory is performed and agreement between these two sources of non-perturbative effects is shown.},

The non-critical string theory is related to critical string theory in anti-{deSitter} background. We introduce a boundary of the anti-{deSitter} space analogous to a cut-off on the Liouville coordinate of the two-dimensional string theory. Correlation functions of operators in the gauge theory are related to the dependence of the supergravity action on the boundary conditions. From the quadratic terms in supergravity we read off the anomalous dimensions. For operators that couple to massless string states it has been established through absorption calculations that the anomalous dimensions vanish, and we rederive this result. The operators that couple to massive string states at level \$n\$ acquire anomalous dimensions that grow as \$2{\textbackslash}left (n g\_\{{YM}\} {\textbackslash}sqrt \{2 N\} ){\textasciicircum}\{1/2\}\$ for large `t Hooft coupling. This is a new prediction about the strong coupling behavior of large \$N\$ {SYM} theory.},

	abstract = {We show that the large \$N\$ limit of certain conformal field theories in various dimensions include in their Hilbert space a sector describing supergravity on the product of Anti-{deSitter} spacetimes, spheres and other compact manifolds. This is shown by taking some branes in the full M/string theory and then taking a low energy limit where the field theory on the brane decouples from the bulk. We observe that, in this limit, we can still trust the near horizon geometry for large \$N\$. The enhanced supersymmetries of the near horizon geometry correspond to the extra supersymmetry generators present in the superconformal group (as opposed to just the super-Poincare group). The 't Hooft limit of 4-d \$\{{\textbackslash}cal N\} =4\$ super-Yang-Mills at the conformal point is shown to contain strings: they are {IIB} strings. We conjecture that compactifications of M/string theory on various Anti-{deSitter} spacetimes are dual to various conformal field theories. This leads to a new proposal for a definition of M-theory which could be extended to include five non-compact dimensions.},

This introduction focuses purely on modern classical field theory, helping graduates and researchers build an understanding of classical field theory methods before embarking on future studies in quantum field theory. It describes various classical methods for fields with negligible quantum effects, for instance electromagnetism and gravitational fields. It focuses on solutions that take advantage of classical field theory methods as opposed to applications or geometric properties. Other fields covered includes fermionic fields, scalar fields and Chern-Simons fields. Methods such as symmetries, global and local methods, Noether theorem and energy momentum tensor are also discussed, as well as important solutions of the classical equations, in particular soliton solutions.},

Motivated by these observations, we discuss how a perturbative framework, leading to a linear piece in the potential, can be developed in a manifestly gauge and Lorentz invariant manner, which moreover enjoys the property of being renormalizable to all orders. We provide an effective action framework to discuss the dynamical realization of the proposed scenario in Yang-Mills gauge theory.},

The result is a recipe to construct a supersymmetric Euclidean theory from any supersymmetric Minkowski theory. This Wick rotation is identified as a complex Lorentz boost in a five-dimensional space and acts uniformly on bosons and fermions. For Majorana and Weyl spinors our approach is reminiscent of the traditional Osterwalder Schrader approach in which spinors are ``doubled'' but the action is not hermitean. However, for Dirac spinors our work provides a link to the work of Schwinger and Zumino in which hermiticity is maintained but spinors are not doubled. Our work differs from recent work by Mehta since we introduce no external metric and transform only the basic fields.},

	abstract = {In differential geometry, the holonomy of a connection on a smooth manifold is a general geometrical consequence of the curvature of the connection measuring the extent to which parallel transport around closed loops fails to preserve the geometrical data being transported.  For flat connections, the associated holonomy is a type of monodromy and is an inherently global notion.  For curved connections, holonomy has nontrivial local and global features.
Any kind of connection on a manifold gives rise, through its parallel transport maps, to some notion of holonomy.  The most common forms of holonomy are for connections possessing some kind of symmetry.  Important examples include: holonomy of the Levi-Civita connection in Riemannian geometry (called Riemannian holonomy), holonomy of connections in vector bundles, holonomy of Cartan connections, and holonomy of connections in principal bundles.  In each of these cases, the holonomy of the connection can be identified with a Lie group, the holonomy group.  The holonomy of a connection is closely related to the curvature of the connection, via the Ambrose–Singer theorem.
The study of Riemannian holonomy has led to a number of important developments.  The holonomy was introduced by Élie Cartan (1926) in order to study and classify symmetric spaces.  It was not until much later that holonomy groups would be used to study Riemannian geometry in a more general setting. In 1952 Georges de Rham proved the de Rham decomposition theorem, a principle for splitting a Riemannian manifold into a Cartesian product of Riemannian manifolds by splitting the tangent bundle into irreducible spaces under the action of the local holonomy groups.  Later, in 1953, Marcel Berger classified the possible irreducible holonomies.  The decomposition and classification of Riemannian holonomy has applications to physics and to string theory.},

A straightforward application of this system is the problem of barrier crossing of active particles, which has been studied only in the limit of small activity. When τ is sufﬁciently large, equilibrium-like approximations break down in the barrier crossing region. In the model under investigation, it emerges as a sort of “negative temperature” region, and numerical simulations conﬁrm the presence of non-convex local velocity distributions. We propose, in the limit of large τ, approximate equations for the typical trajectories which successfully predict many aspects of the numerical results. The local breakdown of detailed balance and its relation with a recent deﬁnition of non-equilibrium heat exchange is also discussed.},

            Microswimmers or active elements, such as bacteria and active filaments, have an elongated shape, which determines their individual and collective dynamics. There is still a need to identify what role long-range hydrodynamic interactions play in their fascinating dynamic structure formation. We construct rods of different aspect ratios using several spherical squirmer model swimmers. With the help of the mesoscale simulation method of multi-particle collision dynamics we analyze the flow fields of these squirmer rods both in a bulk fluid and in Hele-Shaw geometries of different slab widths. Based on the hydrodynamic multipole expansion either for bulk or confinement between two parallel plates, we categorize the different multipole contributions of neutral as well as pusher-type squirmer rods. We demonstrate how confinement alters the radial decay of the flow fields for a given force or source multipole moment compared to the bulk fluid.},

	abstract = {Active systems evade the rules of equilibrium thermodynamics by constantly dissipating energy at the level of their microscopic components. This energy flux stems from the conversion of a fuel, present in the environment, into sustained individual motion. It can lead to collective effects without any equilibrium equivalent, such as a phase separation for purely repulsive particles, or a collective motion (flocking) for aligning particles. Some of these effects can be rationalized by using equilibrium tools to recapitulate nonequilibrium transitions. An important challenge is then to delineate systematically to which extent the character of these active transitions is genuinely distinct from equilibrium analogs. We review recent works that use stochastic thermodynamics tools to identify, for active systems, a measure of irreversibility comprising a coarse-grained or informatic entropy production. We describe how this relates to the underlying energy dissipation or thermodynamic entropy production, and how it is influenced by collective behavior. Then, we review the possibility to construct thermodynamic ensembles out-of-equilibrium, where trajectories are biased towards atypical values of nonequilibrium observables. We show that this is a generic route to discovering unexpected phase transitions in active matter systems, which can also inform their design.},

During that time, there has been an ongoing effort to develop a meaningful human body {ESD} pulse and equipment which is capable of repeatedly applying that pulse at various voltage levels to a semiconductor device. The intent was to determine a part's ability to withstand an {ESD} pulse at a certain voltage level and use that information as an indicator of the part's robustness. Presently, available equipment is capable of applying an {ESD} pulse frequently described in specifications such as {MIL}-{STD} 883C as the human body pulse; but is this the right pulse? Recent technical papers have raised some interesting questions about the {ESD} waveform and methods for capturing this waveform. Specifications such as {IEC} 801-2 have also contributed to the apparent confusion on {ESD} waveforms and, together, these sources of information were the catalyst that stimulated this investigation.},

The dynamics of the Kalecki's business cycle model is represented by a linear first-order {DDE} with constant coefficients, in the capital stock. Such a {DDE}, with constant or flexible lags, also occurs in the continuous time Solow's vintage capital growth model. This is due to the heterogeneity of goods and assets. {DDEs} with constant lags may be preferably solved by using Laplace transforms. Numerous techniques are also proposed for the solution of {DDEs}, like the inverse scattering method, the Jacobian elliptic function method, numerical techniques, the differential transform method, etc. This study retains the Zhou's dif-ferential transform method for solving nonlinear {DDEs} with backward-foreward delays and flexible coefficients. This study also uses a block diagram approach with application to reference economic models, with help of the software {MATHEMATICA} 7.0.1 and its specialized packages for signal processing, such as "Control System Pro-fessional" and "{SchematicSolver}".},

	abstract = {We consider a general class of first-order nonlinear delay-differential equations ({DDEs}) with reflectional symmetry, and study completely the bifurcations of the trivial equilibrium under some generic conditions on the Taylor coefficients of the {DDE}. Our analysis reveals a Hopf bifurcation curve terminating on a pitchfork bifurcation line at a codimension two Takens–Bogdanov point in parameter space. We compute the normal form coefficients of the reduced vector field on the centre manifold in terms of the Taylor coefficients of the original {DDE}, and in contrast to many previous bifurcation analyses of {DDEs}, we also compute the unfolding parameters in terms of these coefficients. For application purposes, this is important since one can now identify the possible asymptotic dynamics of the {DDE} near the bifurcation points by computing quantities which depend explicitly on the Taylor coefficients of the original {DDE}. We illustrate these results using simple model systems relevant to the areas of neural networks and atmospheric physics, and show that the results agree with numerical simulations.},

	title = {A novel control mechanism for natural flocks},
	abstract = {Speed fluctuations of individual birds within natural flocks are moderate, as it is natural to expect given the aerodynamic, energetic and biomechanical constraints of flight. Yet the spatial correlations of such fluctuations have a range as wide as the entire group: the speed change of a bird influences and is influenced by that of birds on the other side of the flock. Long-range correlations and limited speed fluctuations set conflicting constraints on the mechanism controlling the individual speed of each bird, as the factors boosting correlations also tend to amplify speed fluctuations and vice versa. Here, building on experimental field data on starling flocks with group sizes spanning an unprecedented interval of over two orders of magnitude, we develop a novel type of speed control mechanism that generates scale-free correlations yet allowing for biologically plausible values of the flocks' speed. The bare-bones hallmark of this new control is a strongly nonlinear speed-restoring force that ignores small deviations of the individual speed from its natural reference value, while ferociously suppressing larger speed fluctuations. Numerical simulations of self-propelled particles flocks in the same size range as the empirical data fully support our theoretical results. The match of field empirical data, theory and simulations over such an extensive range of sizes suggests that the novel speed control we propose is the most economic theoretical mechanism able to reproduce all key experimental traits of real flocks.},

	abstract = {Collective behaviour in biological systems pitches us against theoretical challenges way beyond the borders of ordinary statistical physics. The lack of concepts like scaling and renormalization is particularly grievous, as it forces us to negotiate with scores of details whose relevance is often hard to assess. In an attempt to improve on this situation, we present here experimental evidence of the emergence of dynamic scaling laws in natural swarms. We find that spatio-temporal correlation functions in different swarms can be rescaled by using a single characteristic time, which grows with the correlation length with a dynamical critical exponent z{\textasciitilde}1. We run simulations of a model of self-propelled particles in its swarming phase and find z{\textasciitilde}2, suggesting that natural swarms belong to a novel dynamic universality class. This conclusion is strengthened by experimental evidence of non-exponential relaxation and paramagnetic spin-wave remnants, indicating that previously overlooked inertial effects are needed to describe swarm dynamics. The absence of a purely relaxational regime suggests that natural swarms are subject to a near-critical censorship of hydrodynamics.},

	abstract = {The correlation time of the positional autocorrelation function is calculated exactly for one‐dimensional translational Brownian motion of a particle in a 2–4 double‐well potential in the noninertial limit. The calculations are carried out using the method of direct conversion (by averaging) of the Langevin equation for a nonlinear stochastic system to a set of differential–recurrence relations. These, in the present problem, reduce on taking the Laplace transform, to a three‐term recurrence relation. Thus the correlation time Tc of the positional autocorrelation function may be formally expressed as a sum of products of infinite continued fractions which may be represented in series form as a sum of two term products of Whittaker’s parabolic cylinder functions. The sum of this series may be expressed as an integral using the integral representation of the parabolic cylinder functions and subsequently the Taylor expansion of the error function, thus yielding the exact solution for Tc. This solution is in numerical agreement with that obtained by Perico et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 98, 564 (1993)] using the first passage time approach while previous asymptotic results obtained by solving the underlying Smoluchowski equation are recovered in the limit of high barrier heights. A simple empirical formula which provides a close approximation to the exact solution for all barrier heights is also given.},

The exact solution is then obtained via matrix continued fractions by using a representation, which symmetrizes the recurrence relations for the observables generated by the averaging procedure leading to convergence of these recurrence relations unlike the previous approaches to the problem. A reliable approximate solution based on the exponential separation of the time scales of the fast intrawell and low overbarrier relaxation processes associated with the bistable potential is also given. It is shown that a knowledge of the three characteristic relaxation times (the integral, effective and the longest relaxation times) of the position correlation function allows one to accurately predict the relaxation behavior of the system in the overdamped limit for all time scales of interest.},

	abstract = {Many natural and artificial systems are subject to some sort of delay, which can be in the form of a single discrete delay or distributed over a range of times. Here, we discuss the impact of this distribution on (thermo-)dynamical properties of time-delayed stochastic systems. To this end, we study a simple classical model with white and colored noise, and focus on the class of Gamma-distributed delays which includes a variety of distinct delay distributions typical for feedback experiments and biological systems. A physical application is a colloid subject to time-delayed feedback control, which is, in principle, experimentally realizable by co-moving optical traps. We uncover several unexpected phenomena in regard to the system’s linear stability and its thermodynamic properties. First, increasing the mean delay time can destabilize or stabilize the process, depending on the distribution of the delay. Second, for all considered distributions, the heat dissipated by the controlled system (e.g., the colloidal particle) can become negative, which implies that the delay force extracts energy and entropy of the bath. As we show here, this refrigerating effect is particularly pronounced for exponential delay. For a specific non-reciprocal realization of a control device, we find that the entropic costs, measured by the total entropy production of the system plus controller, are the lowest for exponential delay. The exponential delay further yields the largest stable parameter regions. In this sense, exponential delay represents the most effective and robust type of delayed feedback.},

We show that, under fairly general conditions, non-reciprocal coupling alone implies a steady energy flow through the system, i.e., non-equilibrium. Projecting out the non-reciprocally coupled degrees of freedom renders non-Markovian, one-variable Langevin descriptions with complex types of memory, for which we find a generalized second law involving information flow. We demonstrate that non-reciprocal linear interactions can be used to engineer non-monotonic memory, which is typical for, e.g., time-delayed feedback control, and is automatically accompanied with a nonzero information flow through the system. Furthermore, already a single non-reciprocally coupled degree of freedom can extract energy from a single heat bath (at isothermal conditions), and can thus be viewed as a minimal version of a time-continuous, autonomous ‘Maxwell demon’. We also show that for appropriate parameter settings, the non-reciprocal system has characteristic features of active matter, such as a positive energy input on the level of the fluctuating trajectories without global particle transport.},

	abstract = {For stochastic systems with discrete time delay, the Fokker-Planck equation ({FPE}) of the one-time probability density function ({PDF}) does not provide a complete, self-contained probabilistic description. It explicitly involves the two-time {PDF}, and represents, in fact, only the first member of an infinite hierarchy. We here introduce a new approach to obtain a Fokker-Planck description by using a Markovian embedding technique and a subsequent limiting procedure. On this way, we find a closed, complete {FPE} in an infinite-dimensional space, from which one can derive a hierarchy of {FPEs}. While the first member is the well-known {FPE} for the one-time {PDF}, we obtain, as second member, a new representation of the equation for the two-time {PDF}. From a conceptual point of view, our approach is simpler than earlier derivations and it yields interesting insight into both, the physical meaning, and the mathematical structure of delayed processes. We further propose an approximation for the two-time {PDF}, which is a central quantity in the description of these non-Markovian systems as it directly gives the correlation between the present and the delayed state. Application to a prototypical bistable system reveals that this approximation captures the non-trivial effects induced by the delay remarkably well, despite its surprisingly simple form. Moreover, it outperforms earlier approaches for the one-time {PDF} in the regime of large delays.},

In the limit, the solution of the linear {BVPs} obtained after quasilinearization converges quadratically to the solution of the nonlinear {BVP} for a judicious initial approximation. The sequence of linear problems so obtained after quasilinearization is analyzed for convergence, and error estimates for the solution of the discretized problem are derived. The method is compared with a standard upwind difference scheme and fitted operator method on uniform mesh by carrying out several numerical experiments. E-mail: kapilks@iitk.ac.in},

@thesis{loos_stochastic_2020,
	title = {Stochastic systems with time delay - probabilistic and thermodynamic descriptions of non-Markovian processes far from equilibrium},
	abstract = {In addition to the ever-present random fluctuations due to noise, many systems in biology, physics and technology involve discrete time delay, stemming, e.g., from finite information transmission times. The combination of noise and delay yields non-Markovian dynamics describable by time-nonlocal Langevin equations with a delta-peaked memory kernel. Despite their omnipresence, the understanding of stochastic systems with time delay is yet in its infancy. This is especially true in the presence of nonlinear forces, which are ubiquitous in realistic situations. In this thesis, we consider a Brownian particle subject to nonlinear forces and time-delayed feedback. This represents an experimentally accessible and analytically treatable prototype of a non-Markovian, intrinsically nonequilibrium system. We consider two important cornerstones of statistical physics: probabilistic descriptions and thermodynamic laws. Both have proven themselves to be valuable frameworks to describe passive particles with time-local equations. And both are, so far, not well-understood for time-delayed systems.

It is already known that the Fokker-Planck description for delayed systems is given by an infinite hierarchy of coupled equations. We compare different derivations of this hierarchy, and further present a new, simpler approach by means of a Markovian embedding technique. Further, we consider the first member of the hierarchy, which has been used in earlier literature as starting point for approximation schemes aiming for the one-time probability density of nonlinear systems. One conceptual disadvantage of the existing approximations is that they effectively render Markovian descriptions, thus, do not capture the essence of the process with memory. To tackle this problem, we propose a new scheme, called the force-linearization closure, which yields a non-Markovian description at the cost of negligence of nonlinear effects in higher-order terms. By application to a bistable and a periodic model, we demonstrate that the resulting one-time probability densities are more accurate than earlier approximations from the literature, in particular, the perturbation theory and the small delay expansion. We further show that the insights provided by the one-time probability alone are limited. This is because the dynamics is crucially determined by the memory, and, subsequently, the temporal correlations. In this spirit, we also shed light on the higher members of the hierarchy, and introduce a new approach aiming for the two-time joint probability density, allowing us to finally describe non-Markovian dynamical effects, e.g., delay-induced oscillations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only approach on the Fokker-Planck level yet that captures this dynamical state.

Turning to thermodynamic quantities, we first focus on the net steady-state heat flow, which is accessible via the framework of stochastic thermodynamics. We show that the feedback inevitably leads to a finite heat flow, even for vanishingly small delay. We link the heat flow at small delay times to “entropy pumping”, which is a phenomenon that is already established for Markovian systems subject to velocity-dependent driving. Application to our bistable model further reveals that the feedback induces heating as well as cooling regimes, and leads to a maximum of medium entropy production at coherence resonance conditions. We further discuss the possibility to quantify the irreversibility and the distance from equilibrium. Here we immediately encounter a fundamental problem, i.e., the notion of total entropy production of non-Markovian systems. As an attempt to address this problem, we additionally include the feedback controller state explicitly in the model. To this end, we step away from the discrete delay and consider systems subject to distributed delay and colored noise. These systems can be represented (via Markovian embedding) by Markovian networks, which can be treated by the standard formalism. We demonstrate that a non-monotonic memory kernel in the Langevin equation is inextricably linked to non-reciprocal coupling. Further, we show that the non-reciprocity alone implies a finite entropy production. We derive a generalized second law involving information flow. Discrete time delay is recovered as the infinite-dimensional limit. Here the entropy production diverges, implying unbounded cost for precisely storing a Brownian trajectory. Our considerations further reveal connections between memory, feedback, and activity, and show that these phenomena are all describable by the same unifying concept, i.e., non-reciprocal coupling.},

The nature of the transition to collective motion is investigated, and the phase diagram in noise-density space is analyzed. It is shown that the ﬂocking transition, which was originally considered to be continuous by Vicsek and collaborators, is actually discontinuous and ﬂuctuation driven. The likeness of the ﬂocking transition in the Vicsek model to a liquid-gas phase transition is discussed, and a qualitative study of the phase coexistence regime is performed. Lastly, the Vicsek model is compared to an active Ising model which shows a similar ﬂocking transition, albeit with a diﬀerent phase coexistence proﬁle. The reason for the diﬀerence in the phase coexistence proﬁles of the two models is discussed and shown to be stochasticity driven.},

	abstract = {We present a model-based output-only method for identifying from time series the parameters governing the dynamics of stochastically forced oscillators. In this context, suitable models of the oscillator’s damping and stiffness properties are postulated, guided by physical understanding of the oscillatory phenomena. The temporal dynamics and the probability density function of the oscillation amplitude are described by a Langevin equation and its associated Fokker–Planck equation, respectively. One method consists in fitting the postulated analytical drift and diffusion coefficients with their estimated values, obtained from data processing by taking the short-time limit of the first two transition moments. However, this limit estimation loses robustness in some situations—for instance when the data are band-pass filtered to isolate the spectral contents of the oscillatory phenomena of interest. In this paper, we use a robust alternative where the adjoint Fokker–Planck equation is solved to compute Kramers–Moyal coefficients exactly, and an iterative optimization yields the parameters that best fit the observed statistics simultaneously in a wide range of amplitudes and time scales. The method is illustrated with a stochastic Van der Pol oscillator serving as a prototypical model of thermoacoustic instabilities in practical combustors, where system identification is highly relevant to control.},

	abstract = {Many physical systems characterized by nonlinear multiscale interactions can be modelled by treating unresolved degrees of freedom as random fluctuations. However, even when the microscopic governing equations and qualitative macroscopic behaviour are known, it is often difficult to derive a stochastic model that is consistent with observations. This is especially true for systems such as turbulence where the perturbations do not behave like Gaussian white noise, introducing non-Markovian behaviour to the dynamics. We address these challenges with a framework for identifying interpretable stochastic nonlinear dynamics from experimental data, using forward and adjoint Fokker–Planck equations to enforce statistical consistency. If the form of the Langevin equation is unknown, a simple sparsifying procedure can provide an appropriate functional form. We demonstrate that this method can learn stochastic models in two artificial examples: recovering a nonlinear Langevin equation forced by coloured noise and approximating the second-order dynamics of a particle in a double-well potential with the corresponding first-order bifurcation normal form. Finally, we apply Langevin regression to experimental measurements of a turbulent bluff body wake and show that the statistical behaviour of the centre of pressure can be described by the dynamics of the corresponding laminar flow driven by nonlinear state-dependent noise.},

	abstract = {We consider a dynamical field theory (Active Model B+) that minimally extends the equilibrium Model B for diffusive phase separation of a scalar field, by adding leading-order terms that break time-reversal symmetry. It was recently shown that such active terms can cause the bulk phase separation of Model B to be replaced by a steady state of microphase separation at a finite length scale. This phenomenon was understood at mean-field level as due to the activity-induced reversal of the Ostwald ripening mechanism, which provides the kinetic pathway to bulk phase separation in passive fluids. This reversal occurs only in certain ranges for the activity parameters. In this paper we go beyond such a mean-field analysis and develop a \$1\$-loop Renormalisation Group ({RG}) approach. We first show that, in the parameter range where bulk phase separation is still present, the critical point belongs formally to the same (Wilson-Fisher) universality class as the passive Model B. In contrast, in a parameter range associated with microphase separation, we find that an unstable non-equilibrium fixed point of the {RG} flow arises for \$d{\textbackslash}geq 2\$, colliding with the Wilson-Fisher point in \$d{\textbackslash}to 2{\textasciicircum}+\$ and making it unstable in \$d=2\$. At large activity, the flow in this region is towards strong coupling. We argue that the phase transition to microphase separation in active systems, in the physically relevant dimensions \$d=2\$ and \$3\$, very probably belongs to a new non-equilibrium universality class. Because it is governed by the strong-coupling regime of the {RG} flow, our perturbative analysis leaves open the quantitative characterization of this new class.},

We show that this volume transport of a solution or a pure liquid caused by a temperature difference across a membrane can be understood as a property of the membrane system, i. e. the membrane with its adjacent solutions. We present experimental values found in the literature of thermo-osmotic coefficients of neutral and hydrophobic as well as charged and hydrophilic membranes, with water and other permeant fluids as well as electrolyte solutions. We propose that the coefficient can be qualitatively explained by a formula that contains the entropy of adsorption of permeant into the membrane, the hydraulic permeability, and a factor that depends on the interface resistance to heat transfer. A variation in the entropy of adsorption with hydrophobic/hydrophilic membranes and structure breaking/structure making cations could then explain the sign of the permeant flux. Systematic experiments in the field are lacking and we propose an experimental program to mend this situation.},

The thermo-osmosis of a gas through a membrane in which it is slightly soluble is due partly to the temperature coefficient of its solubility and partly to the existence of a thermal diffusion process inside the membrane. A theory is developed on the basis of Onsager’s treatment of irreversible processes and leads to equations giving the rate of permeation and the pressure ratio at the stationary state. The magnitude of the effect depends on the algebraic sum of the heat of solution and the heat of transport within the membrane.},

	abstract = {We measured the thermo-osmosis coefficient using {MD} simulations via mechanocaloric and thermoosmotic routes for different solid-liquid interfacial energies. A good agreement is obtained using these two methods, in line with Onsager reciprocal relations. We showed that the standard picture of thermo-osmosis as a thermal gradientinduced Marangoni flow can give only a qualitative description of the phenomenon, because it does not account for the pivotal role of the hydrodynamic boundary condition. For high interfacial energies, due to the oscillations of the excess enthalpy profiles in the vicinity of the solid-liquid interface, the thermo-osmosis coefficient depends closely on the thickness of the stagnant liquid layer, and a change of sign is clearly observed. For low interfacial energies, hydrodynamic slip largely amplifies the thermo-osmosis coefficient, which has also been confirmed by simulations of the water-graphene interface. Finally, we showed that viscous entrance effects reduce significantly the amplitude of the thermo-osmotic flow in the considered nanopore geometries. We hope these results will motivate future experimental development and characterization of new functional interfaces for the efficient harvesting of thermal energy.},

Particular emphasis is put on the thermal response of the electrolyte solution: positive and negative ions diffuse along the temperature gradient and thus induce a thermoelectric ﬁeld which in turn acts on the colloidal charges. Regarding polymers in organic solvents, the physical mechanism changes with decreasing molecular weight: high polymers are described in the framework of macroscopic hydrodynamics; for short chains and molecular mixtures of similar size, the Brownian motion of solute and solvent becomes important.},

However, it remains unclear how broken detailed balance manifests at macroscopic scales and how such dynamics support higher-order biological functions. Here we present a framework to quantify broken detailed balance by measuring entropy production in macroscopic systems. We apply our method to the human brain, an organ whose immense metabolic consumption drives a diverse range of cognitive functions. Using whole-brain imaging data, we demonstrate that the brain nearly obeys detailed balance when at rest, but strongly breaks detailed balance when performing physically and cognitively demanding tasks. Using a dynamic Ising model, we show that these large-scale violations of detailed balance can emerge from fine-scale asymmetries in the interactions between elements, a known feature of neural systems. Together, these results suggest that violations of detailed balance are vital for cognition and provide a general tool for quantifying entropy production in macroscopic systems.},

	title = {Rate of Entropy Production in Stochastic Mechanical Systems},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13930},
	abstract = {Entropy production in stochastic mechanical systems is examined here with strict bounds on its rate. Stochastic mechanical systems include pure diﬀusions in Euclidean space or on Lie groups, as well as systems evolving on phase space for which the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem applies, i.e., return-to-equilibrium processes. Two separate ways for ensembles of such mechanical systems forced by noise to reach equilibrium are examined here. First, a restorative potential and damping can be applied, leading to a classical return-to-equilibrium process wherein energy taken out by damping can balance the energy going in from the noise. Second, the process evolves on a compact conﬁguration space (such as random walks on spheres, torsion angles in chain molecules, and rotational Brownian motion) lead to long-time solutions that are constant over the conﬁguration space, regardless of whether or not damping and random forcing balance. This is a kind of potential-free equilibrium distribution resulting from topological constraints. Inertial and noninertial (kinematic) systems are considered. These systems can consist of unconstrained particles or more complex systems with constraints, such as rigid-bodies or linkages. These more complicated systems evolve on Lie groups and model phenomena such as rotational Brownian motion and nonholonomic robotic systems. In all cases, it is shown that the rate of entropy production is closely related to the appropriate concept of Fisher information matrix of the probability density deﬁned by the Fokker-Planck equation. Classical results from information theory are then repurposed to provide computable bounds on the rate of entropy production in stochastic mechanical systems.},

	abstract = {Living systems break detailed balance at small scales, consuming energy and producing entropy in the environment to perform molecular and cellular functions. However, it remains unclear how broken detailed balance manifests at macroscopic scales and how such dynamics support higher-order biological functions. Here we present a framework to quantify broken detailed balance by measuring entropy production in macroscopic systems. We apply our method to the human brain, an organ whose immense metabolic consumption drives a diverse range of cognitive functions. Using whole-brain imaging data, we demonstrate that the brain nearly obeys detailed balance when at rest, but strongly breaks detailed balance when performing physically and cognitively demanding tasks. Using a dynamic Ising model, we show that these large-scale violations of detailed balance can emerge from fine-scale asymmetries in the interactions between elements, a known feature of neural systems. Together, these results suggest that violations of detailed balance are vital for cognition and provide a general tool for quantifying entropy production in macroscopic systems.},

	abstract = {Stochastic thermodynamics as reviewed here systematically provides a framework for extending the notions of classical thermodynamics such as work, heat and entropy production to the level of individual trajectories of well-deﬁned non-equilibrium ensembles. It applies whenever a non-equilibrium process is still coupled to one (or several) heat bath(s) of constant temperature. Paradigmatic systems are single colloidal particles in time-dependent laser traps, polymers in external ﬂow, enzymes and molecular motors in single molecule assays, small biochemical networks and thermoelectric devices involving single electron transport. For such systems, a ﬁrst-law like energy balance can be identiﬁed along ﬂuctuating trajectories. For a basic Markovian dynamics implemented either on the continuum level with Langevin equations or on a discrete set of states as a master equation, thermodynamic consistency imposes a local-detailed balance constraint on noise and rates, respectively. Various integral and detailed ﬂuctuation theorems, which are derived here in a unifying approach from one master theorem, constrain the probability distributions for work, heat and entropy production depending on the nature of the system and the choice of non-equilibrium conditions. For non-equilibrium steady states, particularly strong results hold like a generalized ﬂuctuation–dissipation theorem involving entropy production. Ramiﬁcations and applications of these concepts include optimal driving between speciﬁed states in ﬁnite time, the role of measurement-based feedback processes and the relation between dissipation and irreversibility. Efﬁciency and, in particular, efﬁciency at maximum power can be discussed systematically beyond the linear response regime for two classes of molecular machines, isothermal ones such as molecular motors, and heat engines such as thermoelectric devices, using a common framework based on a cycle decomposition of entropy production.},

Statistical mechanics aims to derive this behavior from the dynamics and statistics of the atoms and molecules making up these systems. A key element in this derivation is the large number of microscopic degrees of freedom of macroscopic systems. Therefore, the extension of thermodynamic concepts, such as entropy, to small (nano) systems raises many questions. Here we shall reexamine various deﬁnitions of entropy for nonequilibrium systems, large and small. These include thermodynamic (hydrodynamic), Boltzmann, and Gibbs-Shannon entropies. We shall argue that, despite its common use, the last is not an appropriate physical entropy for such systems, either isolated or in contact with thermal reservoirs: physical entropies should depend on the microstate of the system, not on a subjective probability distribution. To square this point of view with experimental results of Bechhoefer we shall argue that the Gibbs-Shannon entropy of a nano particle in a thermal ﬂuid should be interpreted as the Boltzmann entropy of a dilute gas of Brownian particles in the ﬂuid.},

However, an exact mathematical analysis of their dynamics and thermodynamics is available for linear models only. We introduce a class of stochastic delay processes with nonlinear time-local forces and linear time-delayed forces that obey ﬂuctuation theorems and converge to a Boltzmann equilibrium at long times. From the point of view of control theory, such “equilibrium stochastic delay processes” are stable and energetically passive, by construction. Computationally, they provide diverse exact constraints on general nonlinear stochastic delay problems and can, in various situations, serve as a starting point for their perturbative analysis. Physically, they admit an interpretation in terms of an underdamped Brownian particle that is either subjected to a time-local force in a non-Markovian thermal bath or to a delayed feedback force in a Markovian thermal bath. We illustrate these properties numerically for a setup familiar from feedback cooling and point out experimental implications.},

In the presence of a random excitation, such as a Gaussian white noise, the stability of the attractor is measured by calculating Kramer’s escape time. The activation energy is also estimated. Taking into account the time delay on the Gaussian white noise, we showed that the problem of the traditional Kramer escape time can be extended to analyze a bistable system under the inﬂuence of a noise made up of a superposition of a Gaussian white noise and its replicas delayed of time τ . The escape times for the intervals 0 {\textless} t {\textless} τ and τ {\textless} t {\textless} 2τ are calculated analytically.},

In the wild, these collective systems are unavoidably influenced by ubiquitous environmental perturbations such as wind gusts, acoustic and visual stimuli, or the presence of predators or other animals. The way these environmental perturbations influence the animals' collective behaviour, however, is poorly understood, in part because conducting controlled quantitative perturbation experiments in natural settings is challenging. To circumvent the need for controlling environmental conditions in the field, we study swarming midges in a laboratory experiment where we have full control over external perturbations. Here, we consider the effect of controlled variable light exposure on the swarming behaviour. We find that not only do individuals in the swarm respond to light changes by speeding up during brighter conditions but also the swarm as a whole responds to these perturbations by compressing and simultaneously increasing the attraction of individual midges to its centre of mass. The swarm-level response can be described by making an analogy to classical thermodynamics, with the state of the swarm moving along an isotherm in a thermodynamic phase plane.},

	abstract = {Social animals commonly form aggregates that exhibit emergent collective behaviour, with group dynamics that are distinct from the behaviour of individuals. Simple models can qualitatively reproduce such behaviour, but only with large numbers of individuals. But how rapidly do the collective properties of animal aggregations in nature emerge with group size? Here, we study swarms of
              Chironomus riparius
              midges and measure how their statistical properties change as a function of the number of participating individuals. Once the swarms contain order 10 individuals, we find that all statistics saturate and the swarms enter an asymptotic regime. The influence of environmental cues on the swarm morphology decays on a similar scale. Our results provide a strong constraint on how rapidly swarm models must produce collective states. But our findings support the feasibility of using swarms as a design template for multi-agent systems, because self-organized states are possible even with few agents.},

Different types of active particles are considered: run-and-tumble particles, active Brownian particles, and active Brownian particles with a stochastic reorientation along an external ﬁeld. After recalling some analytical results for run-and-rumble particles in one dimension, we focus on the two-dimensional case and obtain a perturbative expression of the density proﬁle in the limit of a fast reorientation dynamics, for the three models of active particles mentioned above. Computing the chemical potentials of the nonequilibrium systems in contact from the knowledge of the stationary probability distribution of the whole system—which agrees with a recently proposed general deﬁnition of the chemical potential in nonequilibrium systems in contact—we, generically, ﬁnd that the chemical potential lacks an equation of state in the sense that it depends on the detailed shape of the potential energy barrier separating the compartments and not only on bulk properties, at odds with equilibrium. This situation is reminiscent of the properties of the mechanical pressure in active systems. We also argue that the Maxwell relation is no longer valid and cannot be used to infer the nonequilibrium chemical potential from the knowledge of the mechanical pressure.},

            Social animals routinely form groups, which are thought to display emergent, collective behavior. This hypothesis suggests that animal groups should have properties at the group scale that are not directly linked to the individuals, much as bulk materials have properties distinct from those of their constituent atoms. Materials are often probed by measuring their response to controlled perturbations, but these experiments are difficult to conduct on animal groups, particularly in the wild. Here, we show that laboratory midge swarms have emergent continuum mechanical properties, displaying a collective viscoelastic response to applied oscillatory visual stimuli that allows us to extract storage and loss moduli for the swarm. We find that the swarms strongly damp perturbations, both viscously and inertially. Thus, unlike bird flocks, which appear to use collective behavior to promote lossless information flow through the group, our results suggest that midge swarms use it to stabilize themselves against environmental perturbations.},

            Collective behaviour in flocks, crowds, and swarms occurs throughout the biological world. Animal groups are generally assumed to be evolutionarily adapted to robustly achieve particular functions, so there is widespread interest in exploiting collective behaviour for bio-inspired engineering. However, this requires understanding the precise properties and function of groups, which remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrate that collective groups can be described in a thermodynamic framework. We define an appropriate set of state variables and extract an equation of state for laboratory midge swarms. We then drive swarms through “thermodynamic” cycles via external stimuli, and show that our equation of state holds throughout. Our findings demonstrate a new way of precisely quantifying the nature of collective groups and provide a cornerstone for potential future engineering design.},

Previous work has shown that a communication time delay in the swarm induces a pattern bifurcation that depends on the size of the coupling amplitude. We extend these results by completely unfolding the bifurcation structure of the mean ﬁeld approximation. Our analysis reveals a direct correspondence between the different dynamical behaviors found in different regions of the coupling-time delay plane with the different classes of simulated coherent swarm patterns. We derive the spatiotemporal scales of the swarm structures, as well as demonstrate how the complicated interplay of coupling strength, time delay, noise intensity, and choice of initial conditions can affect the swarm. In particular, our studies show that for sufﬁciently large values of the coupling strength and/or the time delay, there is a noise intensity threshold that forces a transition of the swarm from a misaligned state into an aligned state. We show that this alignment transition exhibits hysteresis when the noise intensity is taken to be time dependent.},

In this study, we explore the mechanical behaviour of fire ant aggregations, closely knit swarms that display impressive dynamics culminating with the aggregations’ capacity to self-heal and adapt to the environment. Although the combined elasticity and rheology of the ant aggregation can be characterized by phenomenological mechanical models (e.g. linear Maxwell or Kelvin–Voigt model), it is not clear how the behaviour of individual ants affects the aggregations’ emerging responses. Here, we explore an alternative way to think about these materials, describing them as a collection of individuals connected via elastic chains that associate and dissociate over time. Using our knowledge of these connections—e.g. their elasticity and attachment/dissociation rates—we construct a statistical description of connection stretch and derive an evolution equation for the corresponding stretch distribution. This time-evolving stretch distribution is then used to determine important macroscopic measures, e.g. stress, energy storage and energy dissipation, in the network. In this context, we show how the physical characteristics and activities of individual ants can explain the elasticity, flow and shear thinning of the aggregation. In particular, we find that experimental results are matched if the detachment rate between two individuals increases with tension in the connection.},

Previous work by Erdmann, et al. [Phys. Rev. E \{{\textbackslash}bf 71\}, 051904 (2205)] has shown that a large enough noise intensity will cause a translating swarm of individuals to transition to a rotating swarm with a stationary center of mass. We show that with the addition of a time delay, the model possesses a transition that depends on the size of the coupling amplitude. This transition is independent of the initial swarm state (traveling or rotating) and is characterized by the alignment of all of the individuals along with a swarm oscillation. By considering the mean field equations without noise, we show that the time delay induced transition is associated with a Hopf bifurcation. The analytical result yields good agreement with numerical computations of the value of the coupling parameter at the Hopf point.},

We experimentally demonstrate communication delay-induced bifurcations in the spatiotemporal patterns of robot swarms using two distinct hardware platforms in a mixed reality framework. Additionally, we make steps toward experimentally validating theoretically predicted parameter regions where transitions between swarm patterns occur. We show that multiple rotation patterns persist even when collision avoidance strategies are incorporated, and we show the existence of multi-stable, co-existing rotational patterns not predicted by usual mean field dynamics. Our experiments are the first significant steps toward validating existing theory and the existence and robustness of the delay-induced patterns in real robotic swarms.},

Additional signatures of critical dynamics, including hysteresis in presence of symmetry-breaking particle interactions, and a maximum of the susceptibility, are measured and characterized in terms of a theoretical model which is based purely on the timereversal symmetry of the order parameter.},

By exploiting the time-convolutionless transform and a time variable transformation we are able to write a Fokker–Planck equation ({FPE}) for the 1-time and for the 2-time probability distributions valid irrespective of the regime of stability of the Langevin equations. We solve exactly the derived {FPEs} and analyze the aging dynamics by studying analytically the conditional probability distribution. We discuss explicitly why the initially conditioned distribution is not sufﬁcient to describe fully out a non-Markov process as both preparation and observation times have bearing on its dynamics. As our analytic procedure can also be applied to linear Langevin equations with memory kernels, we compare the non-Markov dynamics of a one-delay system with that of a generalized Langevin equation with an exponential as well as a power law memory. Application to a generalization of the Green–Kubo formula is also presented.},

          , 
            Self-propelled colloids, active polymers and membranes, driven (vibrated) granular layers and hybrid synthetic-biological systems are striking examples of systems containing synthetic active Brownian particles. Such particles autonomously convert the available energy of the environment into their own directed mechanical motion. In most studies the self-propelled Brownian particles move in overdamped media. Recently, experiments with Janus particles in a low-pressure plasma have appeared. A distinctive feature of such a medium is an extremely low viscosity at which the inertial effects play a significant role, resulting in underdamped Brownian motion. At present, there is a lack of statistical theory describing the underdamped Brownian motion of self-propelled particles at all time scales. This paper presents the numerical simulation results of active Brownian motion in homogeneous media of different viscosities. The calculations are performed using a mathematical model of a self-propelled Brownian sphere with translational and rotational inertia. The time-dependent mean square displacement and mean linear displacement (the noise-averaged trajectory) of the particle are investigated as a function of medium viscosity, self-propulsion velocity and moment of inertia. Our simulation reveals that the dynamics of a self-propelled spherical particle significantly depends on two independent dimensionless parameters of the particle: the ratio of the self-propulsion velocity to the characteristic thermal velocity and the ratio of the friction coefficient to the rotational diffusion coefficient. The obtained statistical characteristics of active Brownian motion are compared with the known theoretical models in a wide range of medium viscosities. We propose simple corrections to the basic theory of overdamped active Brownian motion, which allow one to calculate the effective diffusion coefficient and the persistence length of a self-propelled Brownian particle in a medium with any dynamic viscosity. The results obtained are discussed in relation to active particles in a colloidal plasma and superfluid helium.},

	abstract = {The pressure of suspensions of self-propelled objects is studied theoretically and by simulation of spherical active Brownian particles ({ABP}). We show that for certain geometries, the mechanical pressure as force/area of a confined systems can equally be expressed by bulk properties, which implies the existence of an nonequilibrium equation of state. Exploiting the virial theorem, we derive expressions for the pressure of {ABPs} confined by solid walls or exposed to periodic boundary conditions. In both cases, the pressure comprises three contributions: the ideal-gas pressure due to white-noise random forces, an activity-induce pressure (swim pressure), which can be expressed in terms of a product of the bare and a mean effective propulsion velocity, and the contribution by interparticle forces. We find that the pressure of spherical {ABPs} in confined systems explicitly depends on the presence of the confining walls and the particle-wall interactions, which has no correspondence in systems with periodic boundary conditions. Our simulations of three-dimensional {APBs} in systems with periodic boundary conditions reveal a pressure-concentration dependence that becomes increasingly nonmonotonic with increasing activity. Above a critical activity and {ABP} concentration, a phase transition occurs, which is reflected in a rapid and steep change of the pressure. We present and discuss the pressure for various activities and analyse the contributions of the individual pressure components.},

A model of the electron Fermi gas in a metal is considered taking explicit account of the consequences of the virial theorem for a stable system of electrons and ions interacting in accordance with the Coulomb law. This model is used to obtain expressions for the total energy and the chemical potential of the conduction electrons in undeformed and deformed met­ als. These expressions are used to estimate the equilibrium concentrations of electrons and ions, the electron work function of a metal, and the contribution of the collectivestate electrons to the bulk modulus of a metal. It is shown that an electric field appears in an inhomogeneously deformed metal and that this field is proportional to the gradient of the bulk strains. A space charge, which is compensated by a surface charge of opposite sign, also appears in such a metal.},

This theorem may be represented by a stochastic equation describing the fluctuation, which is a generalization of the familiar Langevin equation in the classical theory of Brownian motion. In this generalized equation the friction force becomes retarded or frequency-dependent and the random force is no more white. They are related to each other by a generalized Nyquist theorem which is in fact another expression of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. This point of view can be applied to a wide class of irreversible process including collective modes in many-particle systems as has already been shown by Mori. As an illustrative example, the density response problem is briefly discussed.},

We summarize recent generalizations of this standard technique of Brownian thermometry to situations involving spatially heterogeneous temperature fields and other non-equilibrium conditions in the solvent medium. The notion of effective temperatures is reviewed and its scope critically assessed. Our emphasis is on practically relevant real-world applications, for which effective temperatures have been explicitly computed and experimentally confirmed. We also elucidate the relation to the more general concept of (effective) temperature spectra and their measurement by Brownian thermospectrometry. Finally, we highlight the conceptual importance of non-equilibrium thermometry for active and biological matter, such as microswimmer suspensions or biological cells, which often play the role of non-thermal (“active”) heat baths for embedded Brownian degrees of freedom.},

irrespective of the type of animals in the group. One key prediction is that as the density of animals in the group increases,
a rapid transition occurs from disordered movement of individuals within the group to highly aligned collective motion. Understanding
such a transition is crucial to the control of mobile swarming insect pests such as the desert locust. We confirmed the prediction
of a rapid transition from disordered to ordered movement and identified a critical density for the onset of coordinated marching
in locust nymphs. We also demonstrated a dynamic instability in motion at densities typical of locusts in the field, in which
groups can switch direction without external perturbation, potentially facilitating the rapid transfer of directional information.},

	abstract = {This review summarizes theoretical progress in the field of active matter, placing it in the context of recent experiments. This approach offers a unified framework for the mechanical and statistical properties of living matter: biofilaments and molecular motors in vitro or in vivo, collections of motile microorganisms, animal flocks, and chemical or mechanical imitations. A major goal of this review is to integrate several approaches proposed in the literature, from semimicroscopic to phenomenological. In particular, first considered are “dry” systems, defined as those where momentum is not conserved due to friction with a substrate or an embedding porous medium. The differences and similarities between two types of orientationally ordered states, the nematic and the polar, are clarified. Next, the active hydrodynamics of suspensions or “wet” systems is discussed and the relation with and difference from the dry case, as well as various large-scale instabilities of these nonequilibrium states of matter, are highlighted. Further highlighted are various large-scale instabilities of these nonequilibrium states of matter. Various semimicroscopic derivations of the continuum theory are discussed and connected, highlighting the unifying and generic nature of the continuum model. Throughout the review, the experimental relevance of these theories for describing bacterial swarms and suspensions, the cytoskeleton of living cells, and vibrated granular material is discussed. Promising extensions toward greater realism in specific contexts from cell biology to animal behavior are suggested, and remarks are given on some exotic active-matter analogs. Last, the outlook for a quantitative understanding of active matter, through the interplay of detailed theory with controlled experiments on simplified systems, with living or artificial constituents, is summarized.},

The final step that lead to the inter-linkage between information theory and thermodynamics was through Landauer's principle of information erasure that established the fact that information is physical.

              A Maxwell demon makes use of information to convert thermal energy of a reservoir into work. A quantitative example is a thought experiment known as a Szilard engine, which uses one bit of information about the position of a thermalized molecule in a box to extract
              k
              
                B
              
              T
              ln 2 of work. The second law of thermodynamics remains valid because, according to Landauer principle, erasure of the information dissipates at least the same amount of heat. Here, we present an experimental realization of a Maxwell demon similar to a Szilard engine, in the form of a single electron box. We provide, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of extracting nearly
              k
              
                B

              ln 2 of work for one bit of information.
            
          , 
            
              The most succinct manifestation of the second law of thermodynamics is the limitation imposed by the Landauer principle on the amount of heat a Maxwell demon ({MD}) can convert into free energy per single bit of information obtained in a measurement. We propose and realize an electronic {MD} based on a single-electron box operated as a Szilard engine, where
              k
              
                B
              
              T
              ln 2 of heat is extracted from the reservoir at temperature
              T
              per one bit of created information. The information is encoded in the position of an extra electron in the box.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses techniques for generating digital sequences of noise which simulate processes with certain known properties or describing equations. Part I of the paper presents a review of stochastic processes and spectral estimation (with some new results) and a tutorial on simulating continuous noise processes with a known autospectral density or autocorrelation function. In defining these techniques for computer generating sequences, it also defines the necessary accuracy criteria. These methods are compared to some of the common techniques for noise generation and the problems, or advantages, of each are discussed. Finally, Part I presents results on simulating stochastic differential equations. A Runge-Kutta ({RK}) method is presented for numerically solving these equations. Part {II} of the paper discusses power law, or 1/f/sup /spl alpha//, noises. Such noise processes occur frequently in nature and, in many cases, with nonintegral values for /spl alpha/. A review of 1/f noises in devices and systems is followed by a discussion of the most common continuous 1/f noise models. The paper then presents a new digital model for power law noises. This model allows for very accurate and efficient computer generation of 1/f/sup /spl alpha// noises for any /spl alpha/. Many of the statistical properties of this model are discussed and compared to the previous continuous models. Lastly, a number of approximate techniques for generating power law noises are presented for rapid or real time simulation.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

We ﬁnd that under the inﬂuence of this kind of noise, the dynamics of the birhythmic biological system can be well characterized through the concept of stochastic bifurcation, consisting in a qualitative change of the stationary probability distribution. Analytical results are obtained following the quasiharmonic assumption through the Langevin and Fokker–Planck equations. Comparing the analytical and numerical results, we ﬁnd good agreement when the frequencies of both attractors are equal, while the predictions of the analytic estimates deteriorate when the two frequencies depart. We also ﬁnd that the increase of noise intensity leads to coherence resonance.},

This is a generalization of the well-known cases of the one-component plasma (k=−1), Dyson’s log gas (k→0+), and the Calogero-Moser model (k=2). Because of the competition between harmonic confinement and pairwise repulsion, the particles spread over a finite region of space for all k{\textgreater}−2.

Non-reciprocal interactions occur, for instance, in networks of neurons, directional growth of interfaces, and synthetic active materials. While wave propagation in non-reciprocal media has recently been under intense study, less is known about the consequences of non-reciprocity on the collective behavior of many-body systems. Here, we show that non-reciprocity leads to time-dependent phases where spontaneously broken symmetries are dynamically restored. The resulting phase transitions are controlled by spectral singularities called exceptional points. We describe the emergence of these phases using insights from bifurcation theory and non-Hermitian quantum mechanics. Our approach captures non-reciprocal generalizations of three archetypal classes of self-organization out of equilibrium: synchronization, flocking and pattern formation. Collective phenomena in these non-reciprocal systems range from active time-(quasi)crystals to exceptional-point enforced pattern-formation and hysteresis. Our work paves the way towards a general theory of critical phenomena in non-reciprocal matter.},

	abstract = {We examine a non-reciprocally coupled dynamical model of a mixture of two diffusing species. We demonstrate that nonreciprocity, which is encoded in the model via antagonistic cross diffusivities, provides a generic mechanism for the emergence of traveling patterns in purely diffusive systems with conservative dynamics. In the absence of non-reciprocity, the binary fluid mixture undergoes a phase transition from a homogeneous mixed state to a demixed state with spatially separated regions rich in one of the two components. Above a critical value of the parameter tuning non-reciprocity, the static demixed pattern acquires a finite velocity, resulting in a state that breaks both spatial and time translational symmetry, as well as the reflection parity of the static pattern. We elucidate the generic nature of the transition to traveling patterns using a minimal model that can be studied analytically. Our work has direct relevance to nonequilibrium assembly in mixtures of chemically interacting colloids that are known to exhibit non-reciprocal effective interactions, as well as to mixtures of active and passive agents where traveling states of the type predicted here have been observed in simulations. It also provides insight on transitions to traveling and oscillatory states seen in a broad range of nonreciprocal systems with non-conservative dynamics, from reaction-diffusion and prey-predators models to multispecies mixtures of microorganisms with antagonistic interactions.},

	abstract = {Generating an initial condition for a Langevin equation with memory is a non trivial issue. We introduce a generalisation of the Laplace transform as a useful tool for solving this problem, in which a limit procedure may send the extension of memory effects to arbitrary times in the past. This method allows us to compute average position, work, their variances and the entropy production rate of a particle dragged in a complex ﬂuid by an harmonic potential, which could represent the effect of moving optical tweezers. For initial conditions in equilibrium we generalise the results by van Zon and Cohen, ﬁnding the variance of the work for generic protocols of the trap. In addition, we study a particle dragged for a long time captured in an optical trap with constant velocity in a steady state. Our formulas open the door to thermodynamic uncertainty relations in systems with memory.},

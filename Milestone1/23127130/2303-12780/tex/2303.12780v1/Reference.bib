    abstract = { Shear bands, localized regions where shear flows concentrate, form in many complex fluids under a wide range of circumstances. In this review, we outline the main mechanisms that cause shear banding in complex fluids with granularity: foams, emulsions, colloidal suspensions, and granular matter. Apart from shear bands caused by continuum-scale mechanisms such as stress inhomogeneities and flow instabilities, we discuss a range of shear-banding phenomena for which the particle scale plays a crucial role. }

Identifying such systems as a distinct category—Active matter—unifies our understanding of autonomous collective movement in the living world and in some surprising inanimate imitations. In this article I present the active matter framework, briefly recall some early work, review our recent results on single-particle and collective behaviour, including experiments on active granular monolayers, and discuss new directions for the future.}

abstract={Collective states of inanimate particles self-assemble through physical interactions and thermal motion. Despite some phenomenological resemblance, including signatures of criticality, the autonomous dynamics that binds motile agents into flocks, herds, or swarms allows for much richer behavior. Low-dimensional models have hinted at the crucial role played in this respect by perceived information, decision-making, and feedback, implying that the corresponding interactions are inevitably retarded. Here we present experiments on spherical Brownian microswimmers with delayed self-propulsion toward a spatially fixed target. We observe a spontaneous symmetry breaking to a transiently chiral dynamical state and concomitant critical behavior that do not rely on many-particle cooperativity. By comparison with the stochastic delay differential equation of motion of a single swimmer, we pinpoint the delay-induced effective synchronization of the swimmers with their own past as the key mechanism. Increasing numbers of swimmers self-organize into layers with pro- and retrograde orbital motion, synchronized and stabilized by steric, phoretic, and hydrodynamic interactions. Our results demonstrate how even most simple retarded interactions can foster emergent complex adaptive behavior in small active-particle ensembles.},

    "abstract": "Perception-reaction delays have experimentally been found to cause a spontaneous circling of microswimmers around a targeted center. Here we investigate the many-body version of this experiment with Brownian-dynamics simulations of active particles in a plane. For short delays, the soft spherical discs form a hexagonal colloidal crystallite around a fixed target particle. Upon increasing the delay time, we observe a bifurcation to a chiral dynamical state that we can map onto that found for a single active particle. The different angular velocities at different distances from the target induce shear stresses that grow with increasing delay. As a result, tangential and, later, also radial shear bands intermittently break the rotating crystallite. Eventually, for long delays, the discs detach from the target particle to circle around it near the preferred single-particle orbit, while spinning and trembling from tidal quakes",

abstract = {The present work addresses the coupling of a flamelet database, to a low-Mach approximation of the Navier–Stokes equations using scalar controlling variables. The model is characterized by the chemistry tabulation based on laminar premixed flamelets in combination with an optimal choice of the reaction progress variable, which is determined based on the computational singular perturbation (CSP) method. The formulation of the model focuses on turbulent premixed flames taking into account the effect of heat losses, but it is easily extended to partially premixed and non-premixed regimes. The model is designed for applications in both, Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) as well as {L}arge-{E}ddy simulations ({LES}) and results for the two methods are compared. A priori analysis of the database is presented to demonstrate the influence of the reaction progress definition and the chemistry tabulation is validated against a one-dimensional premixed laminar flame. The validation of the turbulent case is performed using a turbulent premixed confined jet flame subject to strong heat losses, in which the model shows a good overall performance.}

abstract = {With the increase in computational power in the last decade and the forthcoming Exascale supercomputers, a new horizon in computational modelling and simulation is envisioned in combustion science. Considering the multiscale and multiphysics characteristics of turbulent reacting flows, combustion simulations are considered as one of the most computationally demanding applications running on cutting-edge supercomputers. Exascale computing opens new frontiers for the simulation of combustion systems as more realistic conditions can be achieved with high-fidelity methods. However, an efficient use of these computing architectures requires methodologies that can exploit all levels of parallelism. The efficient utilization of the next generation of supercomputers needs to be considered from a global perspective, that is, involving physical modelling and numerical methods with methodologies based on High-Performance Computing (HPC) and hardware architectures. This review introduces recent developments in numerical methods for large-eddy simulations (LES) and direct-numerical simulations (DNS) to simulate combustion systems, with focus on the computational performance and algorithmic capabilities. Due to the broad scope, a first section is devoted to describe the fundamentals of turbulent combustion, which is followed by a general description of state-of-the-art computational strategies for solving these problems. These applications require advanced HPC approaches to exploit modern supercomputers, which is addressed in the third section. The increasing complexity of new computing architectures, with tightly coupled CPUs and GPUs, as well as high levels of parallelism, requires new parallel models and algorithms exposing the required level of concurrency. Advances in terms of dynamic load balancing, vectorization, GPU acceleration and mesh adaptation have permitted to achieve highly-efficient combustion simulations with data-driven methods in HPC environments. Therefore, dedicated sections covering the use of high-order methods for reacting flows, integration of detailed chemistry and two-phase flows are addressed. Final remarks and directions of future work are given at the end.}

abstract = {To deal with the major challenges of combustion simulation with detailed chemical kinetics, a new dynamic adaptive chemistry method with mechanisms tabulation (DAC-ST: DAC with single tabulation) and a method in which DAC-ST is combined with the ISAT (In Situ Adaptive Tabulation) approach (DAC-DT: DAC with double tabulation) to accelerate numerical calculation of large chemical mechanisms in turbulent combustion flows are proposed. Compared to the conventional DAC, DAC-ST expedites calculations by tabulating and reusing the reduced mechanisms, and DAC-DT further expedites the calculations by reducing the number of direct ordinary differential equations (ODEs) integrations and tabulating and retrieving the solutions. The correlation of the two mechanisms is evaluated by a pre-specified criterion comprising temperature, pressure, fuel, oxygen, OH, CH2O, and HO2, and can be updated by a user-specified threshold value. The proposed methods were validated in a piloted partially premixed methane/air diffusion flame (Sandia Flame D) with the 53-species GRI-Mech 3.0 and a hydrogen fueled model scramjet combustor (DLR) with 9 species and 27 reactions. The results indicate that the two proposed methods can accurately capture the flame structure and that the relative percentage errors of temperature and species concentration are well-controlled and proportional to the threshold values. Further, compared to the conventional DAC, detailed diagnostics show that DAC-ST and DAC-DT reduce the computational overhead of mechanism reduction by factors of 41 and 96 for Flame D and 165 and 365 for DLR, respectively. They also speed up ODE integration by factors of 3.9 and 7.8 for Flame D and 1.6 and 4.0 for DLR, respectively. The successful validation demonstrates that the two proposed methods can be efficiently used in the simulation of reactive flow for detailed kinetic mechanisms, especially for the case with a large number of cells, e.g., DNS.}

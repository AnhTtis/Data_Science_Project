    "abstract": "We investigate the nonlinear regression problem under L2 loss (square loss) functions. Traditional nonlinear regression models often result in non-convex optimization problems with respect to the parameter set. We show that a convex nonlinear regression model exists for the traditional least squares problem, which can be a promising towards designing more complex systems with easier to train models.",

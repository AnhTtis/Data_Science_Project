    "abstract": "Animal cells are both encapsulated and subdivided by lipid bilayer membranes. Beyond just acting as boundaries, these membranes' shapes influence the function of cells and their compartments. Physically, membranes are two-dimensional fluids with complex elastic behavior, which makes it impossible, for all but a few simple cases, to predict membrane shapes analytically. Instead, the shape and behavior of biological membranes can be determined by simulations. However, the setup and use of such simulations require a significant programming background. The availability of open-source and user-friendly packages for simulating biological membranes needs improvement.Here, we present flippy, an open-source package for simulating lipid membrane shapes, their interaction with proteins or external particles, and the effect of external forces. Our goal is to provide a tool that is easy to use without sacrificing performance or versatility. flippy is an implementation of a dynamically triangulated membrane. We use a precise yet fast algorithm for calculating the geometric properties of membranes and can also account for local spontaneous curvature, a feature not all discretizations allow. Finally, in flippy we can also include regions of purely elastic (non-fluid) membranes and thus explore various shapes encountered in living systems.",

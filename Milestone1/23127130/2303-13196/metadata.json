    "abstract": "We give a short overview of advantages and drawbacks of the classical formulation of minimum cost network flow problems and solution techniques, to motivate a reformulation of classical static minimum cost network flow problems as optimal control problems constrained by port-Hamiltonian systems (pHS). The first-order optimality system for the port-Hamiltonian system-constrained optimal control problem is formally derived. Then we propose a gradient-based algorithm to find optimal controls. The port-Hamiltonian system formulation naturally conserves flow and supports a wide array of further modeling options as, for example, node reservoirs, flow dependent costs, leaking pipes (dissipation) and coupled sub-networks (ports). They thus provide a versatile alternative to state-of-the art approaches towards dynamic network flow problems, which are often based on computationally costly time-expanded networks. We argue that this opens the door for a plethora of modeling options and solution approaches for network flow problems.",

    "abstract": "Suppose $G$ is a compact semisimple Lie group, $μ$ is the normalized Haar measure on $G$, and $A, A^2 \\subseteq G$ are measurable. We show that $$μ(A^2)\\geq \\min\\{1, 2μ(A)+ημ(A)(1-2μ(A))\\}$$ with the absolute constant $η>0$ (independent from the choice of $G$) quantitatively determined. We also show a more general result for connected compact groups without a toric quotient and resolve the Kemperman Inverse Problem from 1964.",

    "publication_venue": "50 pages; the paper subsumes the compact case of arxiv:2006.01824. The proof now is simplified and effective, the smallness assumption in the main theorem is removed, and the model theoretical arguments are no longer needed. For the non-compact case, a more straightforward proof using the non-abelian Brunn-Minkowski inequality was obtained by An, Zhang, and the authors in arXiv:2111.05236"

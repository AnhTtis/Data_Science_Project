Exchange is calculated exactly and the parameters of the model polarisation potential are fixed by independent calculations. The results are in good agreement with experiment and with some of the non-relativistic coupled Hartree-Fock calculations; they demonstrate the importance of core polarisation effects as well as of relativistic effects at low incident energies.},

@article{Cayford1974,
	abstract = {An alternative approach to the solution of the two-center electronic Schr{\"o}dinger equation involving a finite-difference Newton-Raphson algorithm is described. The usual separation in confocal elliptical coordinates is employed leading to two coupled one-dimensional differential equations with split boundary conditions. The corresponding set of finite-difference equations, including the energy eigenvalue, separation constant, boundary conditions, and normalization conditions, are incorporated into a large system of nonlinear algebraic equations which is solved by means of a generalized Newton-Raphson iteration. The present algorithm is relatively simple and flexible. Solutions at one value of the nuclear separation can be easily tracked into solutions at other values. Also with a modification of the boundary conditions continuum states can be obtained as easily as bound states. As examples, calculations of the 2sσg bound state and a positive-energy continuum state of H2+ at a separation R = 5.0 AU are presented. Through the use of a generalized Richardson extrapolation an accuracy of eight significant figures has been achieved.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses the calculation of prolate spheroidal wave functions for integral mode numbers and real spheroidal parameter. The functions have applications in electromagnetism, acoustics, quantum mechanics and finite Fourier analysis. The objective is the use of large values of mode number and spheroidal parameter. This capability allows the solution of the Helmholtz equation when the spheroid is large compared with the wave-length. The paper develops the theory, describes demonstration software and gives several numerical examples. Multiple-precision calculations are also explored. For many purposes the calculation of the eigenvalues and the regular angular function can be regarded as completely solved. Accurate results may be obtained for the radial functions, but the scope is limited by numerical cancellation and slow convergence.},

We use B-spline expansions to represent both angular and radial parts of the wavefunctions. The method takes advantage of the fact that the Schr{\"o}dinger equation is separable with prolate spheroidal coordinates. The effective completeness of the basis set leads to an accurate representation of the molecular spectrum. Partial cross-sections, associated with each open continuum, are calculated. Particular attention is placed on the problem of the normalization of the discretized continua. We show that the proper normalization is simply obtained from a density of states, thus the explicit evaluation of the continua at large distances is not necessary. Accurate values of energies, shifts, one-, four- and six-photon ionization cross-sections are obtained in lowest-order perturbation theory and they are compared with other calculations when available.},

Each signal sent out is entangled with an ancilla, which is retained. Detection takes place via an entangling measurement on the returning signal together with the ancilla. This paper shows that for photodetection, quantum illumination with m bits of entanglement can in principle increase the effective signal-to-noise ratio by a factor of 2m, an exponential improvement over unentangled illumination. The enhancement persists even when noise and loss are so great that no entanglement survives at the detector.},

In this paper we discuss in detail the calculations that we have performed for the 30 elements considered, and present some comparisons of our monochromatic opacities with measurements and other opacity codes. We also use our new opacity tables in solar modeling calculations and compare and contrast such modeling with previous work.},

It is associated with the passage through zero of the matrix element of one of the Δl = 1 transitions, l being the azimuthal quantum number in the united atom limit. The Δl = 3 and 5 transitions are far too weak to be invoked in explanation of the structure observed by Samson and Cairns.},

	abstract = {We present a computational and theoretical framework for solving the Schr{\"o}dinger equation (SE) for the two--center Coulomb problem in prolate spheroidal coordinates when the energy of the SE is positive. A general and robust computer code has been produced that calculates the separation constants, spheroidal harmonic expansion coefficients, regular quasi--radial two--center Coulomb wave functions, and two--center Coulomb phase shifts. These quantities can be calculated over a range of internuclear separations, angular momentum projections, and continuum electron momenta. A representative set of results are presented and compared with previous calculations, excellent agreement is found in many cases while significant disagreements are found in others.
Program summary
Program title: spheroidal-cw CPC Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/nf5gw7vjnh.1 Code Ocean capsule: https://codeocean.com/capsule/7638744 Licensing provisions: MIT Programming language: Fortran 90 Nature of problem: A robust and accurate computer code for calculating Coulomb wave functions in prolate spheroidal coordinate is necessary for the calculation of cross sections for photonionization, and electron and positron scattering on charged diatomic targets. Solution method: The angular solution is expanded in a series of spherical harmonics leading to the diagonalization of a pentadiagonal matrix. The eigenvectors contain the expansion coefficients and the eigenvalues are the separation constants which, unlike the SE in spherical coordinates, are also functions of the energy. The radial two--center Coulomb wave functions are started using a power series solution and then propagated using a linear multistep method. An asymptotic expansion is used to calculate the two--center Coulomb phase shift, and to normalise the radial wave function. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: Two--center Coulomb radial wave functions and phase shifts can be accurately calculated for internuclear separations from 0.001 to 60.0 a0, angular momentum projection Image 1 from 0 to 44, momentum k from 0.01 to 100.0 a.u., and a combined nuclear charge Z+ from 1 to 12.},

	abstract = {{Radiative cooling is central to a wide range of astrophysical problems. Despite its importance, cooling rates are generally computed using very restrictive assumptions, such as collisional ionization equilibrium and solar relative abundances. We simultaneously relax both assumptions and investigate the effects of photoionization of heavy elements by the metagalactic ultraviolet (UV)/X-ray background and of variations in relative abundances on the cooling rates of optically thin gas in ionization equilibrium. We find that photoionization by the metagalactic background radiation reduces the net cooling rates by up to an order of magnitude for gas densities and temperatures typical of the shock-heated intergalactic medium and proto-galaxies (104 K ≲T≲ 106 K, ρ/〈ρ〉≲ 100). In addition, photoionization changes the relative contributions of different elements to the cooling rates. We conclude that photoionization by both the ionizing background and heavy elements needs to be taken into account in order for the cooling rates to be correct to an order of magnitude. Moreover, if the rates need to be known to better than a factor of a few, then departures of the relative abundances from solar need to be taken into account. We propose a method to compute cooling rates on an element-by-element basis by interpolating pre-computed tables that take photoionization into account. We provide such tables for a popular model of the evolving UV/X-ray background radiation, computed using the photoionization package cloudy.}},

@article{Tseng2011,
	abstract = {The Saturnian system is immersed in an extended cloud of neutrals. Although water vapor ejected from Enceladus' south pole is the dominant neutral source, photolysis and radiolysis of ices can release H2O, O2, and H2 from the icy ring particles and the icy satellites, and Titan's atmosphere is a source of H2. Once ionized, these neutrals are the source of the observed magnetospheric plasma. To understand the H2+ ion densities observed by the Cassini plasma spectrometer (CAPS), we developed a Monte Carlo test particle model to simulate the spatial morphology of the neutral H2 cloud and the resulting H2+ ion source rates. The H2 lifetime is constrained by its local chemistry, which is computed from the latest plasma measurements by Cassini CAPS data. The main rings, Enceladus' water torus, Rhea, and Titan are considered as the primary sources of H2 in our model. It is seen that H2 accumulates over Saturn's main rings because of thermal accommodation with the ring particles, and Titan is the dominant source of H2 in the outer magnetosphere (>∼6 RS). From ∼6 to ∼2.5 RS, photodissociation of water from Enceladus and H2 scattered from the ring atmosphere are comparable sources. The newly formed H2+ ions are lost by collisions with the ring particles inside ∼2.5 RS, by interchange processes in the middle magnetosphere, and by flow down the tail in the outer magnetosphere. The density distribution of H2+ estimated from our ion source rates roughly agrees with CAPS observations, and we show that the H2+ density near the equator over the main rings is at least 1 order of magnitude smaller than O2+, possibly consistent with the nondetection of H2+ by CAPS at Saturn orbit insertion.},

	abstract = {Heliospheric neutral atoms and molecules can be ionized and picked up by the solar wind plasma flow. A new generation of space plasma instruments allows detailed study of the solar wind pickup ions with high sensitivity. Detection of H2+ pickup ions in the solar wind is an exceptionally sensitive tool for the search of molecular hydrogen in the heliosphere. Possible sources of neutral molecular hydrogen include contributions from the local interstellar medium release from cometary bodies, and outgassing of interplanetary dust. The flux of the solar wind H2+ pickup ions due to outgassing of interplanetary dust is theoretically established in this work. Solar wind ions bombard and penetrate dust grains where they are neutralized and subsequently released in the form of neutral atoms and molecules. The processes of molecular hydrogen interaction with the solar radiation and solar wind plasma are considered in detail and the process rates are determined. Solar wind H2+ pickup ion fluxes are obtained for heliocentric distances < 5 AU for different heliocentric latitudes. These heliocentric radial and latitudinal dependences would provide guidance for search of the solar wind H2+ pickup ions by Ulysses, WIND, and SOHO missions.},

Both molecular activated recombination (MAR) and ion source reduction due to a power limitation effect are shown to be important in reducing the ion target flux during a density ramp. In contrast, the electron--ion recombination (EIR) ion sink is too small to play an important role in reducing the ion target flux. MAR or EIR do not occur during N2 seeding induced detachment as the target temperatures are not sufficiently low. The impact of  is shown to be underestimated in present (vibrationally unresolved) SOLPS-ITER simulations, which could result from an underestimated  rate. The converged SOLPS-ITER simulations are post-processed with alternative reaction rates, resulting in considerable contributions of  to particle and power losses as well as dissociation below the D2 dissociation area.

	abstract = {Transition to the detached divertor regime that allows lowering the peak power loads on the divertor targets to a tolerable level requires low plasma temperature Te ~ 1 eV and high plasma density ne ~ 1021 m−3 in front of the target. Under such conditions, radiation trapping of the Lyman lines of hydrogen isotopes becomes important. It can influence both energy balance and the ionization/recombination rates significantly. Nevertheless, opacity is typically neglected in the 2D edge transport codes used to study the divertor plasma detachment. We report on the first in-depth investigation of radiation opacity effects on transition to detachment. Simulations are performed with the SOLPS 4.3 code package using a DIII-D size tokamak as a particular example. It is found that in pure hydrogen plasma suppression of the neutral hydrogen radiation loss due to the photon absorption makes reaching the detached plasma regime more difficult. A significantly higher average separatrix plasma pressure is required to reach a similar degree of detachment. Adding plasma impurities compensates for the reduced neutral radiation and offsets the effect of opacity. In a carbon device, where the impurity source is due to erosion of the divertor components and is strongly connected to the edge plasma density, the absorbed fraction of the hydrogen radiation is easily compensated with the increasing carbon radiation loss. However, nowadays, in the more relevant case of the full-metal wall and seeded impurity with the feedback-controlled content, the increase of the edge plasma density alone is insufficient to compensate for trapping of the hydrogen radiation. In this case, achievement of the desired degree of detachment requires higher average separatrix plasma pressure or seeded impurity content than those obtained from the transparent plasma model.},

abstract = {This paper presents an analysis of the concentration of hydrogen molecules inside the ionized region of planetary nebulae (PNs). The equations corresponding to the ionization and chemical equilibria of H, H+, H-, H2, H, and H are coupled with the equations of ionization and thermal balance for a photoionized atomic gas. A total of 40 different reactions related to the formation or destruction of these species are included. The presence of dust is taken into account, since grains act as catalysts for the production of H2 as well as shield the molecules against the stellar ionizing radiation. We analyze the effect of the stellar ionizing continuum as well as of the gas and grain properties on the calculated H2 mass. It is shown that a significant concentration of H2 can survive inside the ionized region of planetary nebulae, mostly in the inner region of the recombination zone. The total H2 to total hydrogen mass ratio inside the ionized region increases with the central star temperature, and, depending on the PN physical conditions, it may be of the order of ~10-6 or even higher. The increase of the recombination zone with stellar temperature can account for such correlation. This may explain why H2 emission is more frequently observed in bipolar PNs (Gatley's rule), since this kind of object typically has hotter stars. Applying our results to the planetary nebula NGC 6720, we obtain an H2 to hydrogen mass ratio similar to the value obtained from the observed H2 line emission.}

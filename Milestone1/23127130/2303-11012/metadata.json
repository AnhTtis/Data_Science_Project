    "abstract": "Circular dichroism is a technologically important phenomenon contrasting the absorption and resultant emission properties between left- and right-handed circularly polarized light. While the chiral handedness of systems mainly determines the mechanism of the circular dichroism in linear optics, the counterpart in the nonlinear optical regime is nontrivial. Here, in contrast to traditional nonlinear circular dichroism responses from structured surfaces, we report on an unprecedented bulk-material-induced circular dichroism of second harmonic generation with a massive g-factor up to 1.8.",

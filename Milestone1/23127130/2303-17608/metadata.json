    "abstract": "This work proposes an interactive art installation \"Mood spRing\" designed to reflect the mood of the environment through interpretation of language and tone. Mood spRing consists of an AI program that controls an immersive 3D animation of the seasons. If the AI program perceives the language and tone of the users as pleasant, the animation progresses through idealized renditions of seasons. Otherwise, it slips into unpleasant weather and natural disasters of the season. To interpret the language and tone of the user interaction, hybrid state-of-the-art emotion detection methods are applied to the user audio and text inputs. The emotional states detected separately from tone and language are fused by a novel approach that aims at minimizing the possible model disparity across diverse demographic groups.",

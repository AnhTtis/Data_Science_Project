   abstract = {We study the fluctuations of subsystem entropies in closed quantum many-body systems after thermalization. Using a combination of analytics and numerics for both random quantum circuits and Hamiltonian dynamics, we find that the statistics of such entropy fluctuations is drastically different than in the classical setting. For instance, shortly after a system thermalizes, the probability of entropy fluctuations for a subregion is suppressed in the dimension of the Hilbert space of the complementary subregion. This suppression becomes increasingly stringent as a function of time, ultimately depending on the exponential of the Hilbert space dimension, until extremely late times when the amount of suppression saturates. We also use our results to estimate the total number of rare fluctuations at large timescales. We find that the "Boltzmann brain" paradox is largely ameliorated in quantum many-body systems, in contrast with the classical setting.},

   abstract = {We propose a neural-network variational quantum algorithm to simulate the time evolution of quantum many-body systems. Based on a modified restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) wavefunction ansatz, the proposed algorithm can be efficiently implemented in near-term quantum computers with low measurement cost without suffering from the vanishing gradient (or barren plateau) issue. Using a qubit recycling strategy, only one ancilla qubit is required to represent all the hidden spins in an RBM architecture. The variational algorithm is extended to open quantum systems by employing a stochastic Schrodinger equation approach. Numerical simulations of spin-lattice models demonstrate that our algorithm is capable of capturing the dynamics of closed and open quantum many-body systems with high accuracy.},

   abstract = {A promising application of neural-network quantum states is to describe the time dynamics of many-body quantum systems. To realize this idea, we employ neural-network quantum states to approximate the implicit midpoint rule method, which preserves the symplectic form of Hamiltonian dynamics. We ensure that our complex-valued neural networks are holomorphic functions, and exploit this property to efficiently compute gradients. Application to the transverse-field Ising model on a one- and two-dimensional lattice exhibits an accuracy comparable to the stochastic configuration method proposed in [Carleo and Troyer, Science 355, 602-606 (2017)], but does not require computing the (pseudo-)inverse of a matrix.},

   abstract = {Laser-cooled and trapped atomic ions form an ideal standard for the simulation of interacting quantum spin models. Effective spins are represented by appropriate internal energy levels within each ion, and the spins can be measured with near-perfect efficiency using state-dependent fluorescence techniques. By applying optical fields that exert optical dipole forces on the ions, their Coulomb interaction can be modulated to produce long-range and tunable spin-spin interactions that can be reconfigured by shaping the spectrum and pattern of the laser fields, in a prototypical example of a quantum simulator. Here we review the theoretical mapping of atomic ions to interacting spin systems, the preparation of complex equilibrium states, the study of dynamical processes in these many-body interacting quantum systems, and the use of this platform for optimization and other tasks. The use of such quantum simulators for studying spin models may inform our understanding of exotic quantum materials and shed light on the behavior of interacting quantum systems that cannot be modeled with conventional computers.},

This review article begins by explaining key background facts about the symmetric subspace from a quantum information perspective. Then we review, and in some places extend, work of Werner and Chiribella that connects the symmetric subspace to state estimation, optimal cloning, the de Finetti theorem and other topics. In the third and final section, we discuss how the symmetric subspace can yield concentration-of-measure results via the calculation of higher moments of random quantum states. There are no new results in this article, but only some new proofs of existing results, such as a variant of the exponential de Finetti theorem. The purpose of the article is (a) pedagogical, and (b) to collect in one place many, if not all, of the quantum information applications of the symmetric subspace.},

Here, we present and experimentally demonstrate a protocol for measuring the second-order Rényi entropy based on statistical correlations between randomized measurements. Our experiments, carried out with a trapped-ion quantum simulator with partition sizes of up to 10 qubits, prove the overall coherent character of the system dynamics and reveal the growth of entanglement between its parts, in both the absence and presence of disorder. Our protocol represents a universal tool for probing and characterizing engineered quantum systems in the laboratory, which is applicable to arbitrary quantum states of up to several tens of qubits.},

We observe a region in parameter space with antiferromagnetic (AF) ordering, albeit with only finite-range correlations. We study systematically the influence of the ramp speeds on the correlations and their growth in time. We observe a delay in their build-up associated to the finite speed of propagation of correlations in a system with short-range interactions. We obtain a good agreement between experimental data and numerical simulations taking into account experimental imperfections measured at the single particle level. Finally, we develop an analytical model, based on a short-time expansion of the evolution operator, which captures the observed spatial structure of the correlations, and their build-up in time.},

   abstract = {Superconducting qubits are leading candidates in the race to build a quantum computer capable of realizing computations beyond the reach of modern supercomputers. The superconducting qubit modality has been used to demonstrate prototype algorithms in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) technology era, in which non-error-corrected qubits are used to implement quantum simulations and quantum algorithms. With the recent demonstrations of multiple high-fidelity, two-qubit gates as well as operations on logical qubits in extensible superconducting qubit systems, this modality also holds promise for the longer-term goal of building larger-scale error-corrected quantum computers. In this brief review, we discuss several of the recent experimental advances in qubit hardware, gate implementations, readout capabilities, early NISQ algorithm implementations, and quantum error correction using superconducting qubits. Although continued work on many aspects of this technology is certainly necessary, the pace of both conceptual and technical progress in recent years has been impressive, and here we hope to convey the excitement stemming from this progress.},

   abstract = {We construct quantum error-correcting codes that embed a finite-dimensional code space in the infinite-dimensional Hilbert state space of rotational states of a rigid body. These codes, which protect against both drift in the body's orientation and small changes in its angular momentum, may be well suited for robust storage and coherent processing of quantum information using rotational states of a polyatomic molecule. Extensions of such codes to rigid bodies with a symmetry axis are compatible with rotational states of diatomic molecules, as well as nuclear states of molecules and atoms. We also describe codes associated with general nonabelian compact Lie groups and develop orthogonality relations for coset spaces, laying the groundwork for quantum information processing with exotic configuration spaces.},

   abstract = {Recent decades have witnessed great developments in the field of quantum simulation—where synthetic systems are built and studied to gain insight into complicated, many-body real-world problems. Systems of individually controlled neutral atoms, interacting with each other when excited to Rydberg states, have emerged as a promising platform for this task, particularly for the simulation of spin systems. Here, we review the techniques necessary for the manipulation of neutral atoms for the purpose of quantum simulation—such as quantum gas microscopes and arrays of optical tweezers—and explain how the different types of interactions between Rydberg atoms allow a natural mapping onto various quantum spin models. We discuss recent achievements in the study of quantum many-body physics in this platform, and some current research directions beyond that.},

Optimizing independent sets is one of the paradigmatic, NP-hard problems in computer science. Our approach is based on coherent manipulation of atom arrays via the excitation into Rydberg atomic states. Specifically, we show that solutions of MIS problems can be efficiently encoded in the ground state of interacting atoms in 2D arrays by utilizing the Rydberg blockade mechanism. By studying the performance of leading classical algorithms, we identify parameter regimes, where computationally hard instances can be tested using near-term experimental systems. Practical implementations of both quantum annealing and variational quantum optimization algorithms beyond the adiabatic principle are discussed.},

   abstract = {Neutral atom qubits with Rydberg-mediated interactions are a leading platform for developing large-scale coherent quantum systems. In the majority of experiments to date, the Rydberg states are not trapped by the same potential that confines ground state atoms, resulting in atom loss and constraints on the achievable interaction time. In this work, we demonstrate that the Rydberg states of an alkaline earth atom, ytterbium, can be stably trapped by the same red-detuned optical tweezer that also confines the ground state, by leveraging the polarizability of the Yb$^+$ ion core. Using the previously unobserved \tripletS series, we demonstrate trapped Rydberg atom lifetimes exceeding $100\,$s, and observe no evidence of auto- or photo-ionization from the trap light for these states. We measure a coherence time of $T_2 = 59$ $$s between two Rydberg levels, exceeding the 28 $$s lifetime of untrapped Rydberg atoms under the same conditions. These results are promising for extending the interaction time of Rydberg atom arrays for quantum simulation and computing, and are vital to capitalize on the extended Rydberg lifetimes in circular states or cryogenic environments.},

We demonstrate a platform that combines the key strengths of these two approaches, based on arrays of individual strontium atoms held within optical tweezers. We report coherence times of 3.4 seconds, single-ensemble duty cycles up to 96% through repeated interrogation, and frequency stability of 4.7 × 10 −16 (τ/s) –1/2 .

   abstract = {String breaking is a central dynamical process in theories featuring confinement, where a string connecting two charges decays at the expense of the creation of new particle-antiparticle pairs. Here, we show that this process can also be observed in quantum Ising chains where domain walls get confined either by a symmetry-breaking field or by long-range interactions. We find that string breaking occurs, in general, as a two-stage process: First, the initial charges remain essentially static and stable. The connecting string, however, can become a dynamical object. We develop an effective description of this motion, which we find is strongly constrained. In the second stage, which can be severely delayed due to these dynamical constraints, the string finally breaks. We observe that the associated time scale can depend crucially on the initial separation between domain walls and can grow by orders of magnitude by changing the distance by just a few lattice sites. We discuss how our results generalize to one-dimensional confining gauge theories and how they can be made accessible in quantum simulator experiments such as Rydberg atoms or trapped ions.},

   abstract = {Laser cooling of a neutral plasma is a challenging task because of the high temperatures typically associated with the plasma state. By using an ultracold neutral plasma created by photoionization of an ultracold atomic gas, we avoid this obstacle and demonstrate laser cooling of ions in a neutral plasma. After 135 microseconds of cooling, we observed a reduction in ion temperature by up to a factor of four, with the temperature reaching as low as 50(4) millikelvin. This pushes laboratory studies of neutral plasmas deeper into the strongly coupled regime, beyond the limits of validity of current kinetic theories for calculating transport properties. The same optical forces also retard the plasma expansion, opening avenues for neutral-plasma confinement and manipulation.},

   abstract = {Multipartite entangled states are crucial for numerous applications in quantum information science. However, the generation and verification of multipartite entanglement on fully controllable and scalable quantum platforms remains an outstanding challenge. We report the deterministic generation of an 18-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state and multicomponent atomic Schrödinger cat states of up to 20 qubits on a quantum processor, which features 20 superconducting qubits, also referred to as artificial atoms, interconnected by a bus resonator. By engineering a one-axis twisting Hamiltonian, the system of qubits, once initialized, coherently evolves to multicomponent atomic Schrödinger cat states—that is, superpositions of atomic coherent states including the GHZ state—at specific time intervals as expected. Our approach on a solid-state platform should not only stimulate interest in exploring the fundamental physics of quantum many-body systems, but also enable the development of applications in practical quantum metrology and quantum information processing.},

Using a programmable quantum simulator based on neutral atom arrays with interactions mediated by Rydberg states, we demonstrate the creation of “Schrödinger cat” states of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) type with up to 20 qubits. Our approach is based on engineering the energy spectrum and using optimal control of the many-body system. We further demonstrate entanglement manipulation by using GHZ states to distribute entanglement to distant sites in the array, establishing important ingredients for quantum information processing and quantum metrology.},

   abstract = {Narrow linewidth optical atomic transitions provide a valuable resource for frequency metrology, and form the basis of today's most precise and accurate clocks. Recent experiments have demonstrated that ensembles of atoms can be interfaced with the mode of an optical cavity using such transitions, and that atom-cavity interactions can dominate over decoherence processes even when the atomic transition that mediates the interactions is very weak. This scenario enables new opportunities for optical frequency metrology, including techniques for nondestructive readout and entanglement enhancement for optical lattice clocks, methods for cavity-enhanced laser frequency stabilization, and high-precision active optical frequency references based on superradiant emission. This tutorial provides a pedagogical description of the physics governing atom-cavity coupling with narrow linewidth optical transitions, and describes several examples of applications to optical frequency metrology.},

   abstract = {The concept of topological phases is a powerful framework to characterize ground states of quantum many-body systems that goes beyond the paradigm of symmetry breaking. Topological phases can appear in condensed matter systems naturally, whereas the implementation and study of such quantum many-body ground states in artificial matter requires careful engineering. Here, we report the experimental realization of a symmetry-protected topological phase of interacting bosons in a one-dimensional lattice, and demonstrate a robust ground state degeneracy attributed to protected zero-energy edge states. The experimental setup is based on atoms trapped in an array of optical tweezers and excited into Rydberg levels, which gives rise to hard-core bosons with an effective hopping generated by dipolar exchange interaction.},

@article{He2019,
   abstract = {One of the most important tasks in modern quantum science is to coherently control and entangle many-body systems, and to subsequently use these systems to realize powerful quantum technologies such as quantum-enhanced sensors. However, many-body entangled states are difficult to prepare and preserve since internal dynamics and external noise rapidly degrade any useful entanglement. Here, we introduce a protocol that counterintuitively exploits inhomogeneities, a typical source of dephasing in a many-body system, in combination with interactions to generate metrologically useful and robust many-body entangled states. Motivated by current limitations in state-of-the-art three-dimensional (3D) optical lattice clocks (OLCs) operating at quantum degeneracy, we use local interactions in a Hubbard model with spin-orbit coupling to achieve a spin-locking effect. In addition to prolonging inter-particle spin coherence, spin-locking transforms the dephasing effect of spin-orbit coupling into a collective spin-squeezing process that can be further enhanced by applying a modulated drive. Our protocol is fully compatible with state-of-the-art 3D OLC interrogation schemes and may be used to improve their sensitivity, which is currently limited by the intrinsic quantum noise of independent atoms. We demonstrate that even with realistic experimental imperfections, our protocol may generate $10$–$14$ dB of spin squeezing in $1$ second with $10^2$–$10^4$ atoms. This capability exemplifies a new paradigm of using driven non-equilibrium systems to overcome current limitations in quantum metrology, allowing OLCs to enter a new regime of enhanced sensing with correlated quantum states.},

   abstract = {Optical atomic clocks, due to their unprecedented stability1–3 and uncertainty3–6, are already being used to test physical theories7,8 and herald a revision of the International System of Units9,10. However, to unlock their potential for cross-disciplinary applications such as relativistic geodesy 11 , a major challenge remains: their transformation from highly specialized instruments restricted to national metrology laboratories into flexible devices deployable in different locations12–14. Here, we report the first field measurement campaign with a transportable 87Sr optical lattice clock 12 . We use it to determine the gravity potential difference between the middle of a mountain and a location 90 km away, exploiting both local and remote clock comparisons to eliminate potential clock errors. A local comparison with a 171Yb lattice clock 15 also serves as an important check on the international consistency of independently developed optical clocks. This campaign demonstrates the exciting prospects for transportable optical clocks.},

   abstract = {We investigate the effects of stimulated scattering of optical lattice photons on atomic coherence times in a state-of-the art $\{\}^\{87\}\{Sr\}$ optical lattice clock. Such scattering processes are found to limit the achievable coherence times to less than 12 s (corresponding to a quality factor of $1  10^\{16\}$), significantly shorter than the predicted 145(40) s lifetime of $\{\}^\{87\}\{Sr\}$'s excited clock state. We suggest that shallow, state-independent optical lattices with increased lattice constants can give rise to sufficiently small lattice photon scattering and motional dephasing rates as to enable coherence times on the order of the clock transition's natural lifetime. Not only should this scheme be compatible with the relatively high atomic density associated with Fermi-degenerate gases in three-dimensional optical lattices, but we anticipate that certain properties of various quantum states of matter can be used to suppress dephasing due to tunneling.},

   abstract = {We experimentally demonstrate a variation on a Sisyphus cooling technique that was proposed for cooling antihydrogen. In our implementation, atoms are selectively excited to an electronic state whose energy is spatially modulated by an optical lattice, and the ensuing spontaneous decay completes one Sisyphus cooling cycle. We characterize the cooling efficiency of this technique on a continuous beam of Sr, and compare it with the case of a Zeeman slower. We demonstrate that this technique provides similar atom number for lower end temperatures, provides additional cooling per scattering event and is compatible with other laser cooling methods.},

We find that loading efficiencies of up to 90% per tweezer are achievable in less than 170 ms for traps separated by more than $1.7 \,\{m\}$. Interestingly, we find the load efficiency is affected by nearby traps and present the efficiency as a function of the spacing between two optical tweezers. This enhanced loading, combined with subsequent rearranging of filled sites, will enable the study of quantum many-body systems via quantum gas assembly.},

It was proposed a decade ago to take advantage of these properties to implement quantum gates between neutral atom qubits. The availability of a strong, long-range interaction that can be coherently turned on and off is an enabling resource for a wide range of quantum information tasks stretching far beyond the original gate proposal. Rydberg enabled capabilities include long-range two-qubit gates, collective encoding of multi-qubit registers, implementation of robust light-atom quantum interfaces, and the potential for simulating quantum many body physics. We review the advances of the last decade, covering both theoretical and experimental aspects of Rydberg mediated quantum information processing.},

This provides the means to combine the outstanding coherence properties of atomic clocks with controllable coupling to strongly interacting states, thus expanding the number of systems suitable for metrological applications and many-body physics studies.},

   abstract = {We present a wave-function approach to the study of the evolution of a small system when it is coupled to a large reservoir. Fluctuations and dissipation originate in this approach from quantum jumps that occur randomly during the time evolution of the system. This approach can be applied to a wide class of relaxation operators in the Markovian regime, and it is equivalent to the standard master-equation approach. For systems with a number of states N much larger than unity this Monte Carlo wave-function approach can be less expensive in terms of calculation time than the master-equation treatment. Indeed, a wave function involves only N components, whereas a density matrix is described by N2 terms. We evaluate the gain in computing time that may be expected from such a formalism, and we discuss its applicability to several examples, with particular emphasis on a quantum description of laser cooling.},

   abstract = {When an atom or a molecule interacts with a light beam, the light emitted or absorbed carries valuable information about the atomic or molecular structure. This phenomenon underlies the whole field of spectroscopy. But the interaction of a photon with an atom can be used to manipulate the atom as well as to probe its structure. For example, in an approach called optical pumping, invented by Alfred Kastler, one can use the resonant exchange of angular momentum between atoms and polarized photons to align or orient the spins of atoms or to put them in nonequilibrium situations. In his original 1950 paper Kastler also proposed using optical pumping to cool and to heat the internal degrees of freedom, calling the phenomena the “effet luminofrigorique” and the “effet luminocalorique.” Another famous example of the use of photon‐atom interaction to control atoms is laser cooling. This technique relies on resonant exchange of linear momentum between photons and atoms to control their external degrees of freedom ...},

Through optical pumping, the atom can be made to feel decelerating optical dipole forces more strongly than accelerating optical dipole forces. This effect, which has previously been realized for free atoms, is called Sisyphus cooling. A simple model for a bound atom is examined in order to reveal the basic aspects of cooling and heating when the atom is confined in the Lamb–Dicke regime. Results of semiclassical and quantum treatments show that the minimum energy achieved is near the zero-point energy and can be much lower than the Doppler cooling limit. Two practical examples that approximate the model are briefly examined.},

@report{Dalibard1989,
   abstract = {We present two cooling mechanisms that lead to temperatures well below the Doppler limit. These mechanisms are based on laser polarization gradients and work at low laser power when the optical-pumping time between different ground-state sublevels becomes long. There is then a large time lag between the internal atomic response and the atomic motion, which leads to a large cooling force. In the simple case of one-dimensional molasses, we identify two types of polarization gradient that occur when the two counterpropagating waves have either orthogonal linear polarizations or orthogonal circular polarizations. In the first case, the light shifts of the ground-state Zeeman sublevels are spatially modulated, and optical pumping among them leads to dipole forces and to a Sisyphus effect analogous to the one that occurs in stimulated molasses. In the second case (+-ar configuration), the cooling mechanism is radically different. Even at very low velocity, atomic motion produces a population difference among ground-state sublevels, which gives rise to unbalanced radiation pressures. From semiclassical optical Bloch equations, we derive for the two cases quantitative expressions for friction coefficients and velocity capture ranges. The friction coefficients are shown in both cases to be independent of the laser power, which produces an equilibrium temperature proportional to the laser power. The lowest achievable temperatures then approach the one-photon recoil energy. We briefly outline a full quantum treatment of such a limit.},

These experiments exploit the rich electronic structure of these elements, which is markedly different from the one of other species for which quantum degeneracy has been attained. Specifically, alkaline-earth-like atoms, such as strontium, feature metastable triplet states, narrow intercombination lines, and a non-magnetic, closed-shell ground state. This review covers the creation of quantum degenerate gases of strontium and the first experiments performed with this new system. It focuses on laser-cooling and evaporation schemes, which enable the creation of Bose-Einstein condensates and degenerate Fermi gases of all strontium isotopes, and shows how they are used for the investigation of optical Feshbach resonances, the study of degenerate gases loaded into an optical lattice, as well as the coherent creation of Sr_2 molecules.},

   abstract = {The reliable detection of single quantum particles has revolutionized the field of quantum optics and quantum information processing. For several years, researchers have aspired to extend such detection possibilities to larger-scale, strongly correlated quantum systems in order to record in situ images of a quantum fluid in which each underlying quantum particle is detected. Here we report fluorescence imaging of strongly interacting bosonic Mott insulators in an optical lattice with single-atom and single-site resolution. From our images, we fully reconstruct the atom distribution on the lattice and identify individual excitations with high fidelity. A comparison of the radial density and variance distributions with theory provides a precise in situ temperature and entropy measurement from single images. We observe Mott-insulating plateaus with near-zero entropy and clearly resolve the high-entropy rings separating them, even though their width is of the order of just a single lattice site. Furthermore, we show how a Mott insulator melts with increasing temperature, owing to a proliferation of local defects. The ability to resolve individual lattice sites directly opens up new avenues for the manipulation, analysis and applications of strongly interacting quantum gases on a lattice. For example, one could introduce local perturbations or access regions of high entropy, a crucial requirement for the implementation of novel cooling schemes.},

Strontium atoms are magneto-optically cooled and trapped by the spin-forbidden transition 1 S 0 - 3 P 1 at 689 nm, while the tight-focused infrared laser couples these two states to the respective dipole-allowed singlet and triplet states to generate the same amount of light shift. These designed light shifts for the cooling transition, enabling simultaneous Doppler cooling and dipole trapping, lead to the efficient loading of cooled atoms into the FORT with a few recoil energies.

We show that this effect can be mitigated by appropriate choice of magnetic bias field, enabling Raman sideband cooling of a single atom close to its three-dimensional ground state in an optical trap with a beam waist as small as $w=900$ nm. We achieve vibrational occupation numbers of $\{n\}_r = 0.01$ and $\{n\}_a = 8$ in the radial and axial directions of the trap, corresponding to an rms size of the atomic wavepacket of 24 nm and 270 nm, respectively.

   abstract = {We explore the prospects for confining alkaline-earth Rydberg atoms in an optical lattice via optical dressing of the secondary core-valence electron. Focussing on the particular case of strontium, we identify experimentally accessible magic wavelengths for simultaneous trapping of ground and Rydberg states. A detailed analysis of relevant loss mechanisms shows that the overall lifetime of such a system is limited only by the spontaneous decay of the Rydberg state, and is not significantly affected by photoionization or autoionization. The van der Waals C-6 coefficients for the Sr(5sns S-1(0)) Rydberg series are calculated, and we find that the interactions are attractive. Finally we show that the combination of magic-wavelength lattices and attractive interactions could be exploited to generate many-body Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states.},

   abstract = {Neutral atoms stored in optical traps are strong candidates for a physical realization of a quantum logic device1, 2. Far off-resonance optical traps provide conservative potentials and excellent isolation from the environment, and they may be arranged to produce arbitrary arrays of traps, where each trap is occupied by a single atom that can be individually addressed3, 4, 5, 6. At present, significant effort is being expended on developing two-qubit gates based on coupling individual Rydberg atoms in adjacent optical microtraps7, 8, 9. A major challenge associated with this approach is the reliable generation of single-atom occupancy in each trap, as the loading efficiency in the past experiments has been limited to 50% (refs 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12). Here we report a loading efficiency of 82.7% in an optical microtrap. We achieve this by manipulating the collisions between pairs of trapped atoms through tailored optical fields and directly observing the resulting single atoms in the trap.},

@article{Kaufman2015,
   abstract = {To advance quantum information science a constant pursuit is the search for physical systems that meet the stringent requirements for creating and preserving quantum entanglement. In atomic physics, robust two-qubit entanglement is typically achieved by strong, long-range interactions in the form of Coulomb interactions between ions or dipolar interactions between Rydberg atoms. While these interactions allow fast gates, atoms subject to these interactions must overcome the associated coupling to the environment and cross-talk among qubits. Local interactions, such as those requiring significant wavefunction overlap, can alleviate these detrimental effects yet present a new challenge: To distribute entanglement, qubits must be transported, merged for interaction, and then isolated for storage and subsequent operations. Here we show how, via a mobile optical tweezer, it is possible to prepare and locally entangle two ultracold neutral atoms, and then separate them while preserving their entanglement. While ultracold neutral atom experiments have measured dynamics consistent with spin entanglement, we are now able to demonstrate two-particle coherence via application of a local gradient and parity measurements; this new entanglement-verification protocol could be applied to arbitrary spin-entangled states of spatially-separated atoms. The local entangling operation is achieved via ultracold spin-exchange interactions, and quantum tunneling is used to combine and separate atoms. Our toolset provides a framework for dynamically entangling remote qubits via local operations within a large-scale quantum register.},

In experiments performed with single 87Rb atoms in optical microtraps actively controlled by a spatial light modulator, we demonstrate various dynamic rearrangements of up to N = 9 atoms including rotation, 2D vacancy filling, guiding, compactification, and 3D shuffling. With the capability of a phase-only Fourier mask to generate arbitrary shapes of the holographic microtraps, it was possible to place single atoms at arbitrary geometries of a few μm size and even continuously reconfigure them by conveying each atom. For this purpose, we loaded a series of computer-generated phase masks in the full frame rate of 60 Hz of the spatial light modulator, so the animation of phase mask transformed the holographic microtraps in real time, driving each atom along the assigned trajectory. Possible applications of this method of transformation of single atoms include preparation of scalable quantum platforms for quantum computation, quantum simulation, and quantum many-body physics.},

However, quantum statistics modifies the behavior of even two particles. Here we demonstrate near-complete control over all the internal and external degrees of freedom of two laser-cooled [Formula: see text]Rb atoms trapped in two optical tweezers. This controllability allows us to observe signatures of indistinguishability via two-particle interference. Our work establishes laser-cooled atoms in optical tweezers as a promising route to bottom-up engineering of scalable, low-entropy quantum systems.},

   abstract = {The ability to manipulate individual atoms, ions or photons allows controlled engineering of the quantum state of small sets of trapped particles; this is necessary to encode and process information at the quantum level. Recent achievements in this direction have used either trapped ions or trapped photons in cavity quantum-electrodynamical systems. A third possibility that has been studied theoretically is to use trapped neutral atoms. Such schemes would benefit greatly from the ability to trap and address individual atoms with high spatial resolution. Here we demonstrate a method for loading and detecting individual atoms in an optical dipole trap of submicrometre size. Because of the extremely small trapping volume, only one atom can be loaded at a time, so that the statistics of the number of atoms in the trap, N, are strongly sub-poissonian (DeltaN2 approximately 0.5N). We present a simple model for describing the observed behaviour, and we discuss the possibilities for trapping and addressing several atoms in separate traps, for applications in quantum information processing.},

We focus specifically on the generation of a perfect optical lattice of simple orthorhombic structure with unit occupancy, as required for initialization of a neutral atom quantum computer. The scheme employs a compacting process that is accomplished by sequential application of two types of operations: a flip operator that changes the internal state of the atoms, and a shift operator that selectively moves the atoms in one internal state along the lattice principal axis. Realizations of these elementary operations and their physical limitations are analyzed. The complexity of the compacting scheme is analyzed and we show that this scales linearly with the number of lattice sites per row of the lattice.},

   abstract = {Inspired by the Hayden-Preskill protocol for black hole evaporation, we consider the dynamics of a quantum many-body qudit system coupled to an external environment, where the time evolution is driven by the continuous limit of certain 2-local random unitary circuits. We study both cases where the unitaries are chosen with and without a conserved U(1) charge and focus on two aspects of the dynamics. First, we study analytically and numerically the growth of the entanglement entropy of the system, showing that two different time scales appear: one is intrinsic to the internal dynamics (the scrambling time), while the other depends on the system-environment coupling. In the presence of a U(1) conserved charge, we show that the entanglement follows a Page-like behavior in time: it begins to decrease in the middle stage of the “evaporation”, and decreases monotonically afterwards. Second, we study the time needed to retrieve information initially injected in the system from measurements on the environment qudits. Based on explicit numerical computations, we characterize such time both when the retriever has control over the initial configuration or not, showing that different scales appear in the two cases.},

   abstract = {A quantum system (with Hilbert space $$\{\mathcal \{H\}_\{1\}\}$$) entangled with its environment (with Hilbert space $$\{\mathcal \{H\}_\{2\}\}$$) is usually not attributed to a wave function but only to a reduced density matrix $$\{\rho_\{1\}\}$$. Nevertheless, there is a precise way of attributing to it a random wave function $$\{\psi_\{1\}\}$$, called its conditional wave function, whose probability distribution $$\{\mu_\{1\}\}$$depends on the entangled wave function $$\{\psi \in \mathcal \{H\}_\{1\} \otimes \mathcal \{H\}_\{2\}\}$$in the Hilbert space of system and environment together. It also depends on a choice of orthonormal basis of $$\{\mathcal \{H\}_\{2\}\}$$but in relevant cases, as we show, not very much. We prove several universality (or typicality) results about $$\{\mu_\{1\}\}$$, e.g., that if the environment is sufficiently large then for every orthonormal basis of $$\{\mathcal \{H\}_\{2\}\}$$, most entangled states $$\{\psi\}$$with given reduced density matrix $$\{\rho_\{1\}\}$$are such that $$\{\mu_\{1\}\}$$is close to one of the so-called GAP (Gaussian adjusted projected) measures, $$\{GAP(\rho_\{1\})\}$$. We also show that, for most entangled states $$\{\psi\}$$from a microcanonical subspace (spanned by the eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian with energies in a narrow interval $$\{[E, E+ \delta E]\}$$) and most orthonormal bases of $$\{\mathcal \{H\}_\{2\}\}$$, $$\{\mu_\{1\}\}$$is close to $$\{GAP(\rm \{tr\}_\{2\} \rho_\{mc\})\}$$with $$\{\rho_\{mc\}\}$$the normalized projection to the microcanonical subspace. In particular, if the coupling between the system and the environment is weak, then $$\{\mu_\{1\}\}$$is close to $$\{GAP(\rho_\beta)\}$$with $$\{\rho_\beta\}$$the canonical density matrix on $$\{\mathcal \{H\}_\{1\}\}$$at inverse temperature $$\{\beta=\beta(E)\}$$. This provides the mathematical justification of our claim in Goldstein et al. (J Stat Phys 125: 1193–1221, 2006) that GAP measures describe the thermal equilibrium distribution of the wave function.},

   abstract = {For a quantum system, a density matrix ρ that is not pure can arise, via averaging, from a distribution μ of its wave function, a normalized vector belonging to its Hilbert space ℋ. While ρ itself does not determine a unique μ, additional facts, such as that the system has come to thermal equilibrium, might. It is thus not unreasonable to ask, which μ, if any, corresponds to a given thermodynamic ensemble? To answer this question we construct, for any given density matrix ρ, a natural measure on the unit sphere in ℋ, denoted GAP(ρ). We do this using a suitable projection of the Gaussian measure on ℋ with covariance ρ. We establish some nice properties of GAP(ρ) and show that this measure arises naturally when considering macroscopic systems. In particular, we argue that it is the most appropriate choice for systems in thermal equilibrium, described by the canonical ensemble density matrix ρβ = (1/Z) exp (−β H). GAP(ρ) may also be relevant to quantum chaos and to the stochastic evolution of open quantum systems, where distributions on ℋ are often used.},

   abstract = {We present a wave-function approach to the study of the evolution of a small system when it is coupled to a large reservoir. Fluctuations and dissipation originate in this approach from quantum jumps that occur randomly during the time evolution of the system. This approach can be applied to a wide class of relaxation operators in the Markovian regime, and it is equivalent to the standard master-equation approach. For systems with a number of states N much larger than unity this Monte Carlo wave-function approach can be less expensive in terms of calculation time than the master-equation treatment. Indeed, a wave function involves only N components, whereas a density matrix is described by N2 terms. We evaluate the gain in computing time that may be expected from such a formalism, and we discuss its applicability to several examples, with particular emphasis on a quantum description of laser cooling.},

As fundamental probes of space and time, atomic clocks have long served to test this prediction at distance scales from 30 centimetres to thousands of kilometres2–4. Ultimately, clocks will enable the study of the union of general relativity and quantum mechanics once they become sensitive to the finite wavefunction of quantum objects oscillating in curved space-time. Towards this regime, we measure a linear frequency gradient consistent with the gravitational redshift within a single millimetre-scale sample of ultracold strontium. Our result is enabled by improving the fractional frequency measurement uncertainty by more than a factor of 10, now reaching 7.6 × 10−21. This heralds a new regime of clock operation necessitating intra-sample corrections for gravitational perturbations.},

In most state-of-the-art approaches, qubits interact locally, constrained by the connectivity associated with their fixed spatial layout. Here we demonstrate a quantum processor with dynamic, non-local connectivity, in which entangled qubits are coherently transported in a highly parallel manner across two spatial dimensions, between layers of single- and two-qubit operations. Our approach makes use of neutral atom arrays trapped and transported by optical tweezers; hyperfine states are used for robust quantum information storage, and excitation into Rydberg states is used for entanglement generation3–5. We use this architecture to realize programmable generation of entangled graph states, such as cluster states and a seven-qubit Steane code state6,7. Furthermore, we shuttle entangled ancilla arrays to realize a surface code state with thirteen data and six ancillary qubits8 and a toric code state on a torus with sixteen data and eight ancillary qubits9. Finally, we use this architecture to realize a hybrid analogue–digital evolution2 and use it for measuring entanglement entropy in quantum simulations10–12, experimentally observing non-monotonic entanglement dynamics associated with quantum many-body scars13,14. Realizing a long-standing goal, these results provide a route towards scalable quantum processing and enable applications ranging from simulation to metrology.},

All of these platforms face two key challenges: scaling up the ensemble size while retaining high-quality control over the parameters, and validating the outputs for these large systems. Here we use programmable arrays of individual atoms trapped in optical tweezers, with interactions controlled by laser excitation to Rydberg states11, to implement an iconic many-body problem—the antiferromagnetic two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model. We push this platform to a regime with up to 196 atoms manipulated with high fidelity and probe the antiferromagnetic order by dynamically tuning the parameters of the Hamiltonian. We illustrate the versatility of our platform by exploring various system sizes on two qualitatively different geometries—square and triangular arrays. We obtain good agreement with numerical calculations up to a computationally feasible size (approximately 100 particles). This work demonstrates that our platform can be readily used to address open questions in many-body physics.},

Semeghini et al. detected signatures of a toric code?type quantum spin liquid in a two-dimensional array of Rydberg atoms held in optical tweezers. ?JS Topological order of the toric code type is realized in two synthetic quantum systems. Quantum spin liquids, exotic phases of matter with topological order, have been a major focus in physics for the past several decades. Such phases feature long-range quantum entanglement that can potentially be exploited to realize robust quantum computation. We used a 219-atom programmable quantum simulator to probe quantum spin liquid states. In our approach, arrays of atoms were placed on the links of a kagome lattice, and evolution under Rydberg blockade created frustrated quantum states with no local order. The onset of a quantum spin liquid phase of the paradigmatic toric code type was detected by using topological string operators that provide direct signatures of topological order and quantum correlations. Our observations enable the controlled experimental exploration of topological matter and protected quantum information processing.},

   abstract = {Executing quantum algorithms on error-corrected logical qubits is a critical step for scalable quantum computing, but the requisite numbers of qubits and physical error rates are demanding for current experimental hardware. Recently, the development of error correcting codes tailored to particular physical noise models has helped relax these requirements. In this work, we propose a qubit encoding and gate protocol for 171Yb neutral atom qubits that converts the dominant physical errors into erasures, that is, errors in known locations. The key idea is to encode qubits in a metastable electronic level, such that gate errors predominantly result in transitions to disjoint subspaces whose populations can be continuously monitored via fluorescence. We estimate that 98% of errors can be converted into erasures. We quantify the benefit of this approach via circuit-level simulations of the surface code, finding a threshold increase from 0.937% to 4.15%. We also observe a larger code distance near the threshold, leading to a faster decrease in the logical error rate for the same number of physical qubits, which is important for near-term implementations. Erasure conversion should benefit any error correcting code, and may also be applied to design new gates and encodings in other qubit platforms.},

Here we implement a ‘multiplexed’ one-dimensional optical lattice clock, in which spatially resolved strontium atom ensembles are trapped in the same optical lattice, interrogated simultaneously by a shared clock laser and read-out in parallel. In synchronous Ramsey interrogations of ensemble pairs we observe atom–atom coherence times of 26 s, a 270-fold improvement over the measured atom–laser coherence time, demonstrate a relative instability of $$9.7(4)\times \{10\}^\{-18\}/\sqrt\{\tau \}$$(where τ is the averaging time) and reach a relative statistical uncertainty of 8.9 × 10−20 after 3.3 h of averaging. These results demonstrate that applications involving optical clock comparisons need not be limited by the instability of the local oscillator. We further realize a miniaturized clock network consisting of 6 atomic ensembles and 15 simultaneous pairwise comparisons with relative instabilities below $$3\times \{10\}^\{-17\}/\sqrt\{\tau \}$$, and prepare spatially resolved, heterogeneous ensemble pairs of all four stable strontium isotopes.

We engineer global single-qubit gates on the optical clock transition and two-qubit entangling gates via adiabatic Rydberg dressing, enabling the generation of Bell states with a state-preparation-and-measurement-corrected fidelity of 92.8(2.0)% (87.1(1.6)% without state-preparation-and-measurement correction). For use in quantum metrology, it is furthermore critical that the resulting entanglement be long lived; we find that the coherence of the Bell state has a lifetime of 4.2(6) s via parity correlations and simultaneous comparisons between entangled and unentangled ensembles. Such long-lived Bell states can be useful for enhancing metrological stability and bandwidth.

   abstract = {Producing quantum states at random has become increasingly important in modern quantum science, with applications being both theoretical and practical. In particular, ensembles of such randomly distributed, but pure, quantum states underlie our understanding of complexity in quantum circuits1 and black holes2, and have been used for benchmarking quantum devices3,4 in tests of quantum advantage5,6. However, creating random ensembles has necessitated a high degree of spatio-temporal control7–12 placing such studies out of reach for a wide class of quantum systems. Here we solve this problem by predicting and experimentally observing the emergence of random state ensembles naturally under time-independent Hamiltonian dynamics, which we use to implement an efficient, widely applicable benchmarking protocol. The observed random ensembles emerge from projective measurements and are intimately linked to universal correlations built up between subsystems of a larger quantum system, offering new insights into quantum thermalization13. Predicated on this discovery, we develop a fidelity estimation scheme, which we demonstrate for a Rydberg quantum simulator with up to 25 atoms using fewer than 104 experimental samples. This method has broad applicability, as we demonstrate for Hamiltonian parameter estimation, target-state generation benchmarking, and comparison of analogue and digital quantum devices. Our work has implications for understanding randomness in quantum dynamics14 and enables applications of this concept in a much wider context4,5,9,10,15–20.},

Here we demonstrate a programmable quantum simulator based on deterministically prepared two-dimensional arrays of neutral atoms, featuring strong interactions controlled by coherent atomic excitation into Rydberg states12. Using this approach, we realize a quantum spin model with tunable interactions for system sizes ranging from 64 to 256 qubits. We benchmark the system by characterizing high-fidelity antiferromagnetically ordered states and demonstrating quantum critical dynamics consistent with an Ising quantum phase transition in (2 + 1) dimensions13. We then create and study several new quantum phases that arise from the interplay between interactions and coherent laser excitation14, experimentally map the phase diagram and investigate the role of quantum fluctuations.

   abstract = {Most topologically nontrivial systems discovered to date consist of noninteracting particles. Their properties can therefore be explained within a single-particle picture. De Léséleuc et al. engineered a topological phase of bosonic atoms in which interactions play a crucial role. The atoms, which were in highly excited Rydberg states, were held in an array of optical tweezers. Depending on the spatial arrangement of the tweezers, the dipole-dipole interactions between the atoms gave rise to two configurations with different topological properties. Science, this issue p. 775 Bosonic Rydberg atoms in an array of optical tweezers form a topological many-body state. The concept of topological phases is a powerful framework for characterizing ground states of quantum many-body systems that goes beyond the paradigm of symmetry breaking. Topological phases can appear in condensed-matter systems naturally, whereas the implementation and study of such quantum many-body ground states in artificial matter require careful engineering. Here, we report the experimental realization of a symmetry-protected topological phase of interacting bosons in a one-dimensional lattice and demonstrate a robust ground state degeneracy attributed to protected zero-energy edge states. The experimental setup is based on atoms trapped in an array of optical tweezers and excited into Rydberg levels, which gives rise to hard-core bosons with an effective hopping generated by dipolar exchange interaction.},

   abstract = {Optical atomic clocks are a driving force for precision measurements due to the high accuracy and stability demonstrated in recent years. While further improvements to the stability have been envisioned by using entangled atoms, squeezing the quantum mechanical projection noise, evaluating the overall gain must incorporate essential features of an atomic clock. Here, we investigate&nbsp;the benefits of spin squeezed states for clocks operated with typical Brownian frequency noise-limited laser sources. Based on an analytic model of the closed servo-loop of an optical atomic clock, we report here quantitative predictions on the optimal clock stability for a given dead time and laser noise. Our analytic predictions are in good agreement with numerical simulations of the closed servo-loop. We find that for usual cyclic Ramsey interrogation of single atomic ensembles with dead time, even with the current most stable lasers spin squeezing can only improve the clock stability for ensembles below a critical atom number of about one thousand in an optical Sr lattice clock. Even with a future improvement of the laser performance by one order of magnitude the critical atom number still remains below 100,000. In contrast, clocks based on smaller, non-scalable ensembles, such as ion clocks, can already benefit from squeezed states with current clock lasers. Optical atomic clocks are useful tools for frequency metrology. Here the authors explore the stability of the atomic clocks and the role of the spin squeezed states for the noise reduction in these clocks.},

In general applications, current QPE algorithms either suffer an exponential time overload or require a set of—notoriously quite fragile—GHZ states. These limitations have so far prevented the demonstration of QPE beyond proof of principles. Here we propose a new QPE algorithm based on a cascade of Gaussian spin states (GSSs) and a suitable adaptive measurement protocol. GSSs are renownedly resilient and have been created experimentally in a variety of platforms, from hundreds of ions up to millions of cold and ultracold neutral atoms. We show that our protocol achieves a QPE sensitivity overcoming previous schemes, including that obtained with GHZ states, scales linearly with time, and is robust against certain sources of noise and decoherence, such as detection noise, in particular. Our work paves the way toward an efficient implementation of the QPE, as well as applications of atomic squeezed states for quantum computation.},

Here we utilize such a local oscillator with two strontium (Sr) optical lattice clocks to achieve an advance in clock stability. Through an anti-synchronous comparison, the fractional instability of both clocks is assessed to be 4.8×10-17∕τ for an averaging time τ (in seconds). Synchronous interrogation enables each clock to average at a rate of 3.5×10-17∕τ, dominated by quantum projection noise, and reach an instability of 6.6 × 10−19 over an hour-long measurement.

Here we implement a ‘multiplexed’ one-dimensional optical lattice clock, in which spatially resolved strontium atom ensembles are trapped in the same optical lattice, interrogated simultaneously by a shared clock laser and read-out in parallel. In synchronous Ramsey interrogations of ensemble pairs we observe atom–atom coherence times of 26 s, a 270-fold improvement over the measured atom–laser coherence time, demonstrate a relative instability of 9.7(4)×10−18/τ (where τ is the averaging time) and reach a relative statistical uncertainty of 8.9 × 10−20 after 3.3 h of averaging. These results demonstrate that applications involving optical clock comparisons need not be limited by the instability of the local oscillator. We further realize a miniaturized clock network consisting of 6 atomic ensembles and 15 simultaneous pairwise comparisons with relative instabilities below 3×10−17/τ, and prepare spatially resolved, heterogeneous ensemble pairs of all four stable strontium isotopes. These results pave the way for multiplexed precision isotope shift measurements, spatially resolved characterization of limiting clock systematics, the development of clock-based gravitational wave and dark matter detectors6–12 and new tests of relativity in the lab13–16.},

   abstract = {Quantum sensors are an established technology that has created new opportunities for precision sensing across the breadth of science. Using entanglement for quantum enhancement will allow us to construct the next generation of sensors that can approach the fundamental limits of precision allowed by quantum physics. However, determining how state-of-the-art sensing platforms may be used to converge to these ultimate limits is an outstanding challenge. Here we merge concepts from the field of quantum information processing with metrology, and successfully implement experimentally a programmable quantum sensor operating close to the fundamental limits imposed by the laws of quantum mechanics. We achieve this by using low-depth, parametrized quantum circuits implementing optimal input states and measurement operators for a sensing task on a trapped-ion experiment. With 26 ions, we approach the fundamental sensing limit up to a factor of 1.45 ± 0.01, outperforming conventional spin-squeezing with a factor of 1.87 ± 0.03. Our approach reduces the number of averages to reach a given Allan deviation by a factor of 1.59 ± 0.06 compared with traditional methods not using entanglement-enabled protocols. We further perform on-device quantum-classical feedback optimization to ‘self-calibrate’ the programmable quantum sensor with comparable performance. This ability illustrates that this next generation of quantum sensor can be used without previous knowledge of the device or its noise environment.},

Precision frequency comparisons between clocks in separate locations enable one to probe the space–time variation of fundamental constants4,5 and the properties of dark matter6,7, to perform geodesy8–10 and to evaluate systematic clock shifts. Measurements on independent systems are limited by the standard quantum limit; measurements on entangled systems can surpass the standard quantum limit to reach the ultimate precision allowed by quantum theory—the Heisenberg limit. Although local entangling operations have demonstrated this enhancement at microscopic distances11–16, comparisons between remote atomic clocks require the rapid generation of high-fidelity entanglement between systems that have no intrinsic interactions. Here we report the use of a photonic link17,18 to entangle two 88Sr+ ions separated by a macroscopic distance19 (approximately 2 m) to demonstrate an elementary quantum network of entangled optical clocks. For frequency comparisons between the ions, we find that entanglement reduces the measurement uncertainty by nearly 2, the value predicted for the Heisenberg limit. Today’s optical clocks are typically limited by dephasing of the probe laser20; in this regime, we find that entanglement yields a factor of 2 reduction in the measurement uncertainty compared with conventional correlation spectroscopy techniques20–22. We demonstrate this enhancement for the measurement of a frequency shift applied to one of the clocks. This two-node network could be extended to additional nodes23, to other species of trapped particles or—through local operations—to larger entangled systems.},

However, the simultaneous realization of these properties remains a central challenge in quantum science across atomic and condensed-matter systems2,4–7. Here we leverage the favourable properties of tweezer-trapped alkaline-earth (strontium-88) atoms8–10, and introduce a hybrid approach to tailoring optical potentials that balances scalability, high-fidelity state preparation, site-resolved readout and preservation of atomic coherence. With this approach, we achieve trapping and optical-clock excited-state lifetimes exceeding 40 seconds in ensembles of approximately 150 atoms. This leads to half-minute-scale atomic coherence on an optical-clock transition, corresponding to quality factors well in excess of 1016. These coherence times and atom numbers reduce the effect of quantum projection noise to a level that is comparable with that of leading atomic systems, which use optical lattices to interrogate many thousands of atoms in parallel11,12. The result is a relative fractional frequency stability of 5.2(3) × 10−17τ−1/2 (where τ is the averaging time in seconds) for synchronous clock comparisons between sub-ensembles within the tweezer array. When further combined with the microscopic control and readout that are available in this system, these results pave the way towards long-lived engineered entanglement on an optical-clock transition13 in tailored atom arrays.},

The standard quantum limit can be overcome by entangling the particles, but the sensitivity is often limited by the final state readout, especially for complex entangled many-body states with non-Gaussian probability distributions. Here, by implementing an effective time-reversal protocol in an optically engineered many-body spin Hamiltonian, we demonstrate a quantum measurement with non-Gaussian states with performance beyond the limit of the readout scheme. This signal amplification through a time-reversed interaction achieves the greatest phase sensitivity improvement beyond the standard quantum limit demonstrated to date in any full Ramsey interferometer. These results open the field of robust time-reversal-based measurement protocols offering precision not too far from the Heisenberg limit. Potential applications include quantum sensors that operate at finite bandwidth, and the principle we demonstrate may also advance areas such as quantum engineering, quantum measurements and the search for new physics using optical-transition atomic clocks.},

At the same time, there is an increasing demand for atomic (ionic) transitions and new interrogation and readout protocols providing minimal sensitivity to external fields and possessing practical operational wavelengths. One of the goals is to simplify the clock operation while maintaining the relative uncertainty at a low 10−18 level achieved at the shortest averaging time. This is especially important for transportable and envisioned space-based optical clocks. Here, we demonstrate implementation of a synthetic frequency approach for a thulium optical clock with simultaneous optical interrogation of two clock transitions. Our experiment shows suppression of the quadratic Zeeman shift by at least three orders of magnitude. The effect of the tensor lattice Stark shift in thulium can also be reduced to below 10−18 in fractional frequency units. This makes the thulium optical clock almost free from hard-to-control systematic shifts. The “simultaneous” protocol demonstrates very low sensitivity to the cross-talks between individual clock transitions during interrogation and readout.},

The stability of optical-lattice clocks (OLCs) is limited both by the interrupted interrogation of the atomic system by the local-oscillator laser (Dick noise5) and by the standard quantum limit (SQL) that arises from the quantum noise associated with discrete measurement outcomes. Although schemes for removing the Dick noise have been recently proposed and implemented4,6–8, performance beyond the SQL by engineering quantum correlations (entanglement) between atoms9–20 has been demonstrated only in proof-of-principle experiments with microwave clocks of limited stability. The generation of entanglement on an optical-clock transition and operation of an OLC beyond the SQL represent important goals in quantum metrology, but have not yet been demonstrated experimentally16. Here we report the creation of a many-atom entangled state on an OLC transition, and use it to demonstrate a Ramsey sequence with an Allan deviation below the SQL after subtraction of the local-oscillator noise. We achieve a metrological gain of 4.\{4\}_\{-0.4\}^\{+0.6\} decibels over the SQL by using an ensemble consisting of a few hundred ytterbium-171 atoms, corresponding to a reduction of the averaging time by a factor of 2.8&nbsp;±&nbsp;0.3.

In theory, it should be possible to achieve a precision limited only by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. A few experiments have beaten the standard quantum limit, but none have achieved Heisenberg-limited scaling until now, largely due to the need for difficult-to-generate exotic quantum entangled states. Higgins et al. adopted an alternative approach using unentangled single-photon states, allowing them to achieve Heisenberg-limited phase estimation. This marks a drastic reduction in the complexity of achieving quantum-enhanced measurement precision. At the fundamental level, measurement precision is limited by the number of quantum resources that are used. Standard measurement schemes lead to a phase uncertainty that scales with this number. In principle, it should be possible to achieve a precision limited only by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Here, an approach using unentangled single-photon states enables the achievement of Heisenberg-limited phase estimation. This represents a drastic reduction in the complexity of achieving quantum-enhanced measurement precision. Measurement underpins all quantitative science. A key example is the measurement of optical phase, used in length metrology and many other applications. Advances in precision measurement have consistently led to important scientific discoveries. At the fundamental level, measurement precision is limited by the number N of quantum resources (such as photons) that are used. Standard measurement schemes, using each resource independently, lead to a phase uncertainty that scales as 1/ —known as the standard quantum limit. However, it has long been conjectured1,2 that it should be possible to achieve a precision limited only by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, dramatically improving the scaling to 1/N (ref. 3). It is commonly thought that achieving this improvement requires the use of exotic quantum entangled states, such as the NOON state4,5. These states are extremely difficult to generate. Measurement schemes with counted photons or ions have been performed with N ≤ 6 (refs 6–15), but few have surpassed the standard quantum limit12,14 and none have shown Heisenberg-limited scaling. Here we demonstrate experimentally a Heisenberg-limited phase estimation procedure. We replace entangled input states with multiple applications of the phase shift on unentangled single-photon states. We generalize Kitaev’s phase estimation algorithm16 using adaptive measurement theory17,18,19,20 to achieve a standard deviation scaling at the Heisenberg limit. For the largest number of resources used (N = 378), we estimate an unknown phase with a variance more than 10 dB below the standard quantum limit; achieving this variance would require more than 4,000 resources using standard interferometry. Our results represent a drastic reduction in the complexity of achieving quantum-enhanced measurement precision.},

@article{Rosenband2013,
   abstract = {In trapped-atom clocks, the primary source of decoherence is often the phase noise of the oscillator. For this case, we derive theoretical performance gains by combining several atomic ensembles. For example, M ensembles of N atoms can be combined with a variety of probe periods, to reduce the frequency variance to M 2 −M times that of standard Ramsey clocks. A similar exponential improvement is possible if the atomic phases of some of the ensembles evolve at reduced frequencies. These ensembles may be constructed from atoms or molecules with lower-frequency transitions, or generated by dynamical decoupling. The ensembles with reduced frequency or probe period are responsible only for counting the integer number of 2π phase wraps, and do not affect the clock's systematic errors. Quantum phase measurement with Gaussian initial states allows for smaller ensemble sizes than Ramsey spectroscopy. Atomic clocks have many technical and scientific applications , and also serve as model systems for quantum metrology. An important result of quantum mechanics is that the variance of phase measurements can be reduced if entangled particles are used rather than an equal number of unentangled ones [1, 2]. This result has been applied to the theoretical analysis of atomic clocks that operate by repeatedly measuring the phase difference between atomic qubits and a classical oscilla-tor [3-10]. However, these analyses have not taken full advantage of the hybrid nature of passive atomic clocks, where a classical oscillator with limited coherence reproduces the resonance frequency of more coherent quantum systems. The present model derives an exponential gain from additional couplings between atoms and the laboratory system, to digitize their relative phase evolution. It is related to classical analog-to-digital conversion techniques [11] and digital computation of the arctan function [12], which have been extended to the use of qubits for the measurement of classical fields [13] and meso-scopic spins [14]. Here it is shown that if the information from M ensembles of N atoms is combined classically, the frequency variance may be reduced to M D 1−M /2 times the variance of standard Ramsey clocks with M N atoms, where the value of D is constrained by the ensemble size. The method works by extending the range of invertible phases from the usual −π. .. π interval to −D M−1 π. .. D M−1 π. One ensemble is used for normal phase measurements, while the other M −1 ensembles are measured with free-evolution periods that are reduced by factors D −1 ,. .. , D 1−M , or evolve at frequencies that are reduced by the same factors. This allows unambiguous counting of the number of 2π phase wraps that occur in the first ensemble. The passive atomic clocks considered here operate by periodically measuring the differential phase evolution between a classical oscillator and an ensemble of atoms. These measurements yield corrections to the oscillator, which is adjusted in a feedback loop to produce an output signal whose frequency approximates that of the ideal unperturbed atomic resonance. The stability of atomic clocks, which describes the uncertainty of this approximation as a function of the averaging duration, is limited by quantum projection noise [3] for short durations. If a clock operates by repeatedly applying the Ramsey technique [15] to measure the phase difference of N unentangled atoms with respect to the oscillator, the projection-noise-limited fractional-frequency stability is σ yp (τ) = (ω √ N T τ) −1 , where T is the free-evolution period, τ is the total duration, and ω is the angular frequency of the atoms [3, 4]. This stability limit is an important figure of merit, and it connects atomic clocks to quantum metrology, because the use of entangled states allows σ yp (τ) to scale more favorably as N −1. A clock that operates for duration τ has a fractional time-variance of var(τ)/τ 2 = σ yp (τ) 2 + σ ya (τ) 2 , where σ ya (τ) is the accuracy, which does not decrease below the bounds set by the systematic errors. For short measurement durations, quantum measurement noise restricts the degree to which atomic clocks can reproduce the ideal frequency ω. For long durations, the dominant uncertainty comes from systematic errors due to effects such as unknown environmental factors. Proposals to use the available atoms more efficiently, and thereby reduce σ yp , include the use of spin-squeezed states [8, 16-18]; more general quantum measurements are also possible [6, 9, 10, 19, 20]. Such approaches are restricted by the fact that the atomic phase evolves as φ = T 0},

   abstract = {A new method is proposed to reduce the frequency noise of a local oscillator to the level of white phase noise by maintaining (not destroying by projective measurement) the coherence of the ensemble pseudo-spin of atoms over many measurement cycles. This method, which we call ‘atomic phase lock (APL)’, uses weak measurement to monitor the phase in the Ramsey method and repeat the cycle without initialization of the phase. APL will achieve white phase noise as long as the noise accumulated during dead time and the decoherence are smaller than the measurement noise. A numerical simulation confirmed that with APL, the Allan deviation is averaged down at a maximum rate that is proportional to the inverse of the total measurement time, τ−1. In contrast, current atomic clocks that use projection measurement suppress the noise only to the white frequency noise level, in which case the Allan deviation scales as τ−1/2. Faraday rotation is one way to achieve weak measurement for APL. The strength of Faraday rotation with 171Yb+ ions trapped in a linear rf-trap is evaluated, and the performance of APL is discussed. The main source of decoherence is a spontaneous emission, induced by the probe beam for Faraday rotation measurement. The Faraday rotation measurement can be repeated until the decoherence becomes comparable to the signal-to-noise ratio of the measurement. The number of cycles for a realistic experimental parameter is estimated to be ∼100.},

   abstract = {The standard model of particle physics accurately describes all particle physics measurements made so far in the laboratory. However, it is unable to answer many questions that arise from cosmological observations, such as the nature of dark matter and why matter dominates over antimatter throughout the Universe. Theories that contain particles and interactions beyond the standard model, such as models that incorporate supersymmetry, may explain these phenomena. Such particles appear in the vacuum and interact with common particles to modify their properties. For example, the existence of very massive particles whose interactions violate time-reversal symmetry, which could explain the cosmological matter–antimatter asymmetry, can give rise to an electric dipole moment along the spin axis of the electron. No electric dipole moments of fundamental particles have been observed. However, dipole moments only slightly smaller than the current experimental bounds have been predicted to arise from particles more massive than any known to exist. Here we present an improved experimental limit on the electric dipole moment of the electron, obtained by measuring the electron spin precession in a superposition of quantum states of electrons subjected to a huge intramolecular electric field. The sensitivity of our measurement is more than one order of magnitude better than any previous measurement. This result implies that a broad class of conjectured particles, if they exist and time-reversal symmetry is maximally violated, have masses that greatly exceed what can be measured directly at the Large Hadron Collider.},

   abstract = {The generation of a register of highly coherent, but independent, qubits is a prerequisite to performing universal quantum computation. Here we introduce a qubit encoded in two nuclear spin states of a single 87Sr atom and demonstrate coherence approaching the minute-scale within an assembled register of individually-controlled qubits. While other systems have shown impressive coherence times through some combination of shielding, careful trapping, global operations, and dynamical decoupling, we achieve comparable coherence times while individually driving multiple qubits in parallel. We highlight that even with simultaneous manipulation of multiple qubits within the register, we observe coherence in excess of 105 times the current length of the operations, with $$\{T\}_\{2\}^\{\{\{\{\{\mathrm\{echo\}\}\}\}\}\}=\left(40\pm 7\right)$$seconds. We anticipate that nuclear spin qubits will combine readily with the technical advances that have led to larger arrays of individually trapped neutral atoms and high-fidelity entangling operations, thus accelerating the realization of intermediate-scale quantum information processors.},

Neutral-atom hyperfine qubits provide inherent scalability owing to their identical characteristics, long coherence times and ability to be trapped in dense, multidimensional arrays1. Combined with the strong entangling interactions provided by Rydberg states2–4, all the necessary characteristics for quantum computation are available. Here we demonstrate several quantum algorithms on a programmable gate-model neutral-atom quantum computer in an architecture based on individual addressing of single atoms with tightly focused optical beams scanned across a two-dimensional array of qubits. Preparation of entangled Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) states5 with up to six qubits, quantum phase estimation for a chemistry problem6 and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA)7 for the maximum cut (MaxCut) graph problem are demonstrated. These results highlight the emergent capability of neutral-atom qubit arrays for universal, programmable quantum computation, as well as preparation of non-classical states of use for quantum-enhanced sensing.},

   abstract = {Ultracold atoms in optical lattices provide a versatile tool with which to investigate fundamental properties of quantum many-body systems. In particular, the high degree of control of experimental parameters has allowed the study of many interesting phenomena, such as quantum phase transitions and quantum spin dynamics. Here we demonstrate how such control can be implemented at the most fundamental level of a single spin at a specific site of an optical lattice. Using a tightly focused laser beam together with a microwave field, we were able to flip the spin of individual atoms in a Mott insulator with sub-diffraction-limited resolution, well below the lattice spacing. The Mott insulator provided us with a large two-dimensional array of perfectly arranged atoms, in which we created arbitrary spin patterns by sequentially addressing selected lattice sites after freezing out the atom distribution. We directly monitored the tunnelling quantum dynamics of single atoms in the lattice prepared along a single line, and observed that our addressing scheme leaves the atoms in the motional ground state. The results should enable studies of entropy transport and the quantum dynamics of spin impurities, the implementation of novel cooling schemes, and the engineering of quantum many-body phases and various quantum information processing applications.},

Being able to interface into these arrays to access the quantum information being processed and pass it along to another module remains a challenge. ?or?evi? et al. developed a hybrid quantum system that combines atoms held in optical tweezers and a nanophotonic cavity to demonstrate full quantum control, efficient quantum nondestructive readout, and entanglement of atom pairs (see the Perspective by Kaufman). By combining atomic manipulation both inside and away from the cavity field and shuffling the atom qubits into and out of the cavity mode, the authors demonstrate a viable optical interface that could be scaled to larger systems. ?ISO Optical tweezing of atom arrays combined with a photonic cavity leads to a viable interface for quantum information processing. The realization of an efficient quantum optical interface for multi-qubit systems is an outstanding challenge in science and engineering. Using two atoms in individually controlled optical tweezers coupled to a nanofabricated photonic crystal cavity, we demonstrate entanglement generation, fast nondestructive readout, and full quantum control of atomic qubits. The entangled state is verified in free space after being transported away from the cavity by encoding the qubits into long-lived states and using dynamical decoupling. Our approach bridges quantum operations at an optical link and in free space with a coherent one-way transport, potentially enabling an integrated optical interface for atomic quantum processors.},

 abstract = {Quantum key distribution (QKD) together with one time pad encoding can provide information-theoretical security for communication. Currently, though QKD has been widely deployed in many metropolitan fiber networks, its implementation in a large scale remains experimentally challenging. This letter provides a brief review on the experimental efforts towards the goal of global QKD, including the security of practical QKD with imperfect devices, QKD metropolitan and backbone networks over optical fiber and satellite-based QKD over free space.},

This enhanced signal is measured to obtain a depth-resolved image in a laser scanning microscope setup. Plasmon-resonance images of both live and fixed cells, showing specific labeling of cellular organelles and membranes, either by two-photon autofluorescence or by third-harmonic generation, are presented.},

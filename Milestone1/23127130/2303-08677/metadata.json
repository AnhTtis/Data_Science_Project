    "abstract": "Relying on the notions of submodular function and partial metric, we introduce normed inverse semigroups as a generalization of normed groups and sup-semilattices equipped with an upper valuation. We define the property of skew-convexity for a metric on an inverse semigroup, and prove that every norm on a Clifford semigroup gives rise to a right-invariant and skew-convex metric; it makes the semigroup into a Hausdorff topological inverse semigroup if the norm is cyclically permutable. Conversely, we show that every Clifford monoid equipped with a right-invariant and skew-convex metric admits a norm for which the metric topology and the norm topology coincide. We characterize convergence of nets and show that Cauchy completeness implies conditional monotone completeness with respect to the natural partial order of the inverse semigroup.",

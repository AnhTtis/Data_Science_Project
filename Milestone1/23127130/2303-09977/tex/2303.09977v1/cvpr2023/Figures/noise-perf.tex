\caption{Quantity of depth noises in NYU~\cite{silberman2012indoor}. (a) the percentage of the delta noise in each object class of the reconstructed visual surface. (b) the percentage of the zero noise on each object class of the depth value. (c) the models' estimation performance gap on the noisy NYU and the noise-free NYUCAD~\cite{firman2016NYUCAD} datasets, where CCPNet~\cite{zhang2019cascaded-ccpnet}, 3D-Sketch~\cite{chen20203d} and FFNet~\cite{wang2022ffnet} are three baselines. 
The performance gap is obtained from results on NYUCAD minus results on NYU.

\caption{The existing depth noises can be roughly categorized into: 1) \textbf{zero noise} and 2) \textbf{delta noise}. By \textbf{zero noise}, we mean that when the depth camera cannot confirm the depth value of some local regions, it fills these regions with zeroes, leading to the problem of incomplete volumetric predictions. 
%
By \textbf{delta noise}, we mean the inevitable deviation (\ie, $\Delta d$) of the obtained depth value due to the inherent quality defects of the depth camera, which leads to the problem of confused semantic labels in the final 3D voxels.

In the above blocks, the pairwise subfigures (e.g., (d) and (e))
show the cases of ``with noise'' and ``without noise'' on the left and right, respectively.}

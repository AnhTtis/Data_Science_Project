\caption{Overall architecture of our proposed CleanerS, consisting of two networks: a teacher network, and a student network. The two networks share the same architectures but have different weights. The distillation pipelines include a feature-based cleaner surface distillation (\ie, \emph{KD-T}), and logit-based cleaner semantic distillations (\ie, \emph{KD-SC} and \emph{KD-SA}). The dimensions of the inputs and outputs in the student network are omitted as they are the same as in the teacher network.}

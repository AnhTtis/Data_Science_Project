\caption{Qualitative comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, including SSCNet~\cite{song2017semantic} and 3D-Sketch~\cite{chen20203d}. We show that 1) the incomplete visible surface will lead to incomplete prediction (in the $1_{st}$ row of (c)); 2) the models trained with the supervision of confused class labels will confuse the object semantics in inference ($1_{st}$ row (d) and $2_{nd}$ row (c, d)).}

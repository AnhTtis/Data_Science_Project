\section{Conclusions}
We presented a novel CleanerS framework for tackling the task of SSC.
We first computed the percentage of zero noise and delta noise in the depth values. 
Then, we showed that these two types of noises have caused severe negative effects on SSC models. In our CleanerS, we trained a teacher network to learn clean knowledge and provided intermediate supervision for the learning of a student network.
Compared to the existing SSC methods, CleanerS can not only achieve more accurate performance but also requires no ground-truth labels in inference.

Extensive experimental results validated that our CleanerS can shield the negative effects of noisy depth values, and achieve the new state-of-the-art on the challenging NYU dataset.

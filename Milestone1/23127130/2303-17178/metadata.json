    "abstract": "The present study represents a data-driven turbulent model based machine learning algorithm with Galilean invariance preservation. The fully connected neural network (FCNN) and tensor basis neural network (TBNN) [Ling et al. (2016)] are established. The models are trained based on five kinds of flow cases with Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and high-fidelity data. The mappings between two invariant sets and the Reynolds stress anisotropy tensor are trained. The prediction of the Reynolds stress anisotropy tensor is treated as user's defined RANS turbulent model with a modified turbulent kinetic energy transport equation. The results show that the FCNN and TBNN models can accurately predict the anisotropy tensor and turbulent state compared with the traditional RANS model for square duct flow and periodic flow cases. The machine learning based turbulent model with turbulent kinetic energy consideration can improve the prediction precision compared with only mean strain rate tensor and mean rotation rate tensor based models. The TBNN model is able to predict a better flow velocity profile due to a prior physical knowledge.",

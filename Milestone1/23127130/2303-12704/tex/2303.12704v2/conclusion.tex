\section{Conclusion}
We introduced a new category of image-to-image translation that can operate with approximately-paired images, making it a practical solution for sim-to-real applications. 
Our proposed architecture takes advantage of this approximately-paired data to produce better results compared to unpaired translation methods.
Our approach integrates the latest advances in GANs and employs multiple loss functions, including a novel luminance loss, to effectively overcome the challenges of sim-to-real transfer and bridge the realism gap. 
% The results of our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method that can be used for real-world applications.

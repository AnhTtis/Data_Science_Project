    "abstract": "Understanding the universe in its pristine epoch is crucial in order to obtain a concise comprehension of the late-time universe. Although current data in cosmology are compatible with Gaussian primordial perturbations whose power spectrum follows a nearly scale-invariant power law, this need not be the case when a fundamental theoretical construction is assumed. These extended models lead to sharp features in the primordial power spectrum, breaking its scale invariance. In this work, we obtain combined constraints on four primordial feature models by using the final data release of the BOSS galaxies and eBOSS quasars. By pushing towards the fundamental mode of these surveys and using the larger eBOSS volume, we were able to extend the feature parameter space (i.e. the feature frequency $ω$) by a factor of four compared to previous analyses using BOSS. While we did not detect any significant features, we show that next-generation galaxy surveys such as DESI will improve the sensitivity to features by a factor of 7, and will also extend the parameter space by a factor of 2.5.",

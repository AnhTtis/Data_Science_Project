    "abstract": "In [40] Okuyama and Sakai gave a conjectural equality for the higher genus generalized Brézin--Gross--Witten (BGW) free energies. In a recent work [45] we established the Hodge-BGW correspondence on the relationship between certain special cubic Hodge integrals and the generalized BGW correlators, and a proof of the Okuyama--Sakai conjecture was also given ${\\it ibid}$. In this paper, we give a new proof of the Okuyama--Sakai conjecture by a further application of the Dubrovin--Zhang theory for the KdV hierarchy.",

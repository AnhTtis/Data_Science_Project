    "abstract": "A graph $H$ is said to be \"common\" if the number of monochromatic labelled copies of $H$ in a $2$-colouring of the edges of a large complete graph is asymptotically minimized by a random colouring. It is well known that the disjoint union of two common graphs may be uncommon; e.g., $K_2$ and $K_3$ are common, but their disjoint union is not. We find the first examples of a pair of uncommon graphs whose disjoint union is common and a common graph and an uncommon graph whose disjoint union is common. Our approach is to reduce the problem of showing that certain disconnected graphs are common to a constrained optimization problem in which the constraints are derived from supersaturation bounds related to Razborov's Triangle Density Theorem. We also improve bounds on the Ramsey multiplicity constant of a triangle with a pendant edge and the disjoint union of $K_3$ and $K_2$.",

    "abstract": "Fast domain wall motion in systems with perpendicular magnetization is necessary for many novel applications such as the racetrack memory, domain wall logic devices and artificial synapses. The domain wall speed has been greatly improved after the demonstration of current driven domain wall motion using the spin transfer torque, and later achieved another leap due to the combined effect of spin-Hall effect and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). However, only Neel wall can be effectively driven in the latter system. In this paper, we show that both Bloch and Neel domain walls can be effectively moved by exploiting the field-like torque with the out-of-plane spin polarization, which can be generated in materials with reduced symmetry. In addition, we find that the Neel wall and Bloch walls stabilized by the magnetostatic energy are easily distorted by the spin-orbit torque and they then enter the Walker breakdown region. External magnetic field and DMI are introduced to stabilize the domain wall, and a very high domain wall velocity over 500 m/s is obtained at a moderate current density of $2\\times 10^{11} A/m^2$. In principle, this mechanism can be used to drive any types of domain walls. This work thus provides new degrees of freedom in the control of domain wall motion.",

    "abstract": "In this paper a novel discrete-time realization of the super-twisting controller is proposed. The closed-loop system is proven to be globally asymptotically stable in the absence of a disturbance by means of Lyapunov theory. Furthermore, the steady-state error in the disturbed case is computed analytically and shown to be independent of the parameters. The steady-state error only depends on the sampling time and the unknown disturbance. The proposed discrete-time controller is compared to previously published discrete-time super-twisting controllers by means of the controller structure. In extensive simulation studies the proposed controller is evaluated comparative to known controllers. The continuous-time super-twisting controller is capable of rejecting any unknown Lipschitz-continuous perturbation. Furthermore, the convergence time decreases, if any of the gains is increased. The simulations demonstrate that the systems closed in the loop with each of the known controllers lose one of these properties, introduce discretization-chattering effects, or do not yield the same accuracy level as with the proposed controller. The proposed controller, in contrast, is beneficial in terms of the above described properties of the continuous-time super-twisting controller.",

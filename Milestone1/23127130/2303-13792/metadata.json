    "abstract": "Affine quantization is a relatively new procedure, and it can solve many new problems. This essay reviews this new, and novel, procedure for particle problems, as well as those of fields and gravity. New quantization tools, which are extremely close to, and even constructed from, the tools of canonical quantization, are able to fully solve selected problems that using the standard canonical quantization would fail. In particular, improvements can even be found with an affine quantization of fields, as well as gravity.",

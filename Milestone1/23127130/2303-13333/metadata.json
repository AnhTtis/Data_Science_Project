    "abstract": "Bazhanov--Stroganov maps are set theoretical solutions to the 4-simplex equation, namely the fourth member of the family of $n$-simplex equations, which are fundamental equations of mathematical physics. In this letter, we develop a method for constructing Bazhanov--Stroganov 4-simplex maps as extensions of solutions to the Zamolodchikov tetrahedron equation. We employ this method to construct birarional, noninvolutive 4-simplex maps which boil down to the famous Hirota tetrahedron map at a certain limit.",

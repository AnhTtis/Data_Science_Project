    "abstract": "Magnetic double perovskite compounds provide a fertile playground to explore interesting electronic and magnetic properties. By complementary macroscopic characterizations, neutron powder diffraction measurements and first-principles calculations, we have performed comprehensive studies on the magnetic ordering in the double perovskite compound Sr$_2$NiWO$_6$. It is found by neutron diffraction to order magnetically in a collinear AFM structure in a tetragonal lattice with $k$ = (0.5, 0, 0.5) below $T\\rm_N$ = 56 K. In the ground state, the ordered moment of the spin-1 Ni$^{2+}$ ions is determined to be 1.9(2) $μ\\rm_{B}$, indicating a significant quenching of the orbital moment. The Ni$^{2+}$ moments in Sr$_2$NiWO$_6$ are revealed to cant off the $c$ axis by 29.2$^{\\circ}$ with an easy-axis type magnetic anisotropy, which is well supported by the first-principles calculations. Furthermore, the in-plane and out-of-plane next-nearest-neighbor superexchange couplings ($J\\rm_2$ and $J\\rm_{2c}$) are found to play a dominant role in the spin Hamiltonian of Sr$_2$NiWO$_6$, which accounts for the stabilization of the collinear AFM-II structure as its magnetic ground state.",

abstract = {We present an interactive modelling technique, which reconstructs three-dimensional objects from user-drawn two-dimensional strokes. We first extract a skeleton from the 2D contour, and the skeleton is used to define an implicit surface that fits the 2D contour. The reconstructed 3D shape has a natural aspect, it is very smooth and can easily be edited and modified using strokes or performing operations on the skeleton. This method is very accessible for non-specialist users and it allows fast and easy shape prototyping.},

abstract = {Various systems have explored the idea of inferring 3D models from sketched 2D outlines. In all of these systems the underlying modeling methodology limits the complexity of models that can be created interactively. The ShapeShop sketch-based modeling system utilizes Hierarchical Implicit Volume Models (BlobTrees) as an underlying shape representation. The BlobTree framework supports interactive creation of complex, detailed solid models with arbitrary topology. A new technique is described for inflating 2D contours into rounded three-dimensional implicit volumes. Sketch-based modeling operations are defined that combine these basic shapes using standard blending and CSG operators. Since the underlying volume hierarchy is by definition a construction history, individual sketched components can be non-linearly edited and removed. For example, holes can be interactively dragged through a shape. ShapeShop also provides 2D drawing assistance using a new curve-sketching system based on variational contours. A wide range of models can be sketched with ShapeShop, from cartoon-like characters to detailed mechanical parts. Examples are shown which demonstrate significantly higher model complexity than existing systems.},

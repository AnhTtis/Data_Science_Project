\begin{abstract}
\noindent 

We explore theoretically how the topological properties of 2D materials can be manipulated by cavity quantum electromagnetic fields for both resonant and off-resonant electron-photon coupling, with a focus on van der Waals moir\'{e} superlattices. We investigate an electron-photon topological Chern number for the cavity-dressed energy minibands that is well defined for any degree of hy- bridization of the electron and photon states. While an off-resonant cavity mode can renormalize electronic topological phases that exist without cavity coupling, we show that when the cavity mode is resonant to electronic miniband transitions, new and higher electron-photon Chern numbers can emerge.

%\section{Introduction}
In recent years van der Waals heterostructures combining atomic-thin layers of 2D materials such as graphene or transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) have attracted a great deal of interest \cite {Geim2013,Ajayan2016,Novoselov2016,Song2018,valosOvando2019,Yankowitz2019}. Indeed, these systems present rich and controllable physical properties already at the single-particle level due to multiple quantum degrees of freedom, namely the electron spin, the valley and layer pseudospins. This class of 2D materials exhibits a wide variety of interesting electronic properties including semimetallic, semiconducting, superconducting and magnetic phases. One prominent example is magic angle twisted bilayer graphene, exhibiting quasi-flat electronic bands \cite{Bistritzer2011} and remarkable superconducting properties \cite{Cao2018}. Another notable class of moir\'{e} heterostructures is based on TMD materials, which, thanks to their semiconductor properties, have particularly interesting optical properties \cite{Seyler2019,Tran2019,Jin2019}.

A growing interest is emerging for the manipulation of materials with cavity vacuum fields \cite{FornDaz2019, FriskKockum2019,GarciaVidal2021,Schlawin2022}. In particular, metallic split-ring terahertz electromagnetic resonators are remarkable for their deeply sub-wavelength photon mode confinement \cite{Keller2017,Scalari2012, ParaviciniBagliani2018} with mode volumes that can be as small as $10^{-10}\lambda_0^3$, being $\lambda_0$ the free-space electromagnetic wavelength corresponding to the resonator frequency.  
Studies on GaAs 2D electron gases have shown that electronic transport in mesoscopic quantum Hall bars can be greatly modified by the coupling to electromagnetic resonators even without illumination \cite{Appugliese2022}, as a result of  cavity-mediated electron hopping \cite{Ciuti2021,Arwas2023}, which results in a breakdown of the Hall resistance quantization associated to the topological properties of the electronic Landau states.

Recent theoretical works have investigated how to exploit cavity QED to control topological properties of systems, such as 1D tight-binding chains described by the SSH model \cite{Dmytruk2022}. Concerning 2D systems, a recent work has studied 2D bulk materials \cite{Wang2019,Li2022} where the standard electron Chern number is computed by considering an effective electronic Hamiltonian obtained by adiabatic elimination of the photon degrees of freedom. A letter exploring single-sheet graphene ribbons \cite{Guerci_PRL_2020} has studied  electron Chern numbers computed once the cavity field is approximated in a classical coherent state. Another investigation has explored a generic single-electron problem in the ultrastrong light-matter coupling regime \cite{Masuki2023} and focused on the topological control in the configuration where the cavity photon mode frequency is much larger than the relevant electronic transition frequencies. A key point that has not been addressed is the behavior of genuine electron-photon topological invariants that are associated to the interacting quantum electron-photon system when the photon mode is resonant to electronic transitions.  In the past, this has been done only for classical exciton-polariton normal modes where a bosonic exciton field is strongly coupled to a cavity photon field \cite{Karzig_PRX_2015,Ozawa_RMP_2019} (the bare cavity photon and exciton bands are topologically trivial, but the hybrid light-matter polariton bands      are not). However, for a fermionic particle coupled to a quantized cavity field, to the best of our knowledge, the study of  electron-photon topological invariants for the resonant light-matter coupling has been overlooked.


In this letter, we explore the properties of electron-photon Chern numbers, focusing on cavity-embedded 2D moir\'e materials. We investigate different regimes of coupling (off-resonant versus resonant cavity mode), for different cavity geometries (mode with in-plane or out-of-plane polarization) and explore the topological transitions characterized by such an electron-photon Chern number with realistic values for state-of-the-art split-ring resonators and TMD materials. We show that in the case of resonant electron-photon coupling, new topological phases and high Chern numbers can emerge.

{\it Cavity QED Hamiltonian ---} Let us consider a bilayer moir\'e system consisting of two twisted TMD layers embedded in a single-mode resonator (see the sketch in Fig. \ref{fig:TMD-mBZ}). Each of them is a honeycomb lattice defined by two primitive translation vectors $\mathbf{a}_1 = a_0\sqrt{3}/2(1, \sqrt{3}, 0)$ and $\mathbf{a}_2 = a_0\sqrt{3}/2(-1, \sqrt{3}, 0)$, where $a_0$ is the monolayer TMD lattice constant. We consider in-plane parallel stacking (R-stacking) with the layer on top rotated by a small angle $\theta$ in order to create a long wavelength moir\'{e} pattern. The distance between two layers is $d$. The moir\'{e} unit cell is defined by $\mathbf{L}_{i = 1,2} = \left[\mathbb{1} - R(\theta)^{-1}\right]^{-1}\mathbf{a}_i$, where $\mathbb{1}$ and $R(\theta)$ are respectively the identity and the rotation matrix corresponding to the rotation angle $\theta$ about the $z$-axis. We denote the moir\'{e} lattice constant $\left|\mathbf{L}_i\right|$ as $a_M$, where for small angles $a_{M} \simeq a_0/\theta$. In the following, for numerical applications we will use parameters of the $\text{MoTe}_2$ system \cite{Wu2019}. For the photonic part, thanks to the approximately flat mode inside the capacitive gap of complementary split-ring resonators \cite{Appugliese2022}, we will consider a single-mode cavity with a spatially homogeneous field described by the vector potential $\hat{\mathbf{A}} = A_0 \, \mathbf{u}(\hat{a} +\hat{a}^{\dagger})$ with $\hat{a}^{\dagger}$ ($\hat{a}$) the photonic creation (annihilation) operator. The vacuum field amplitude is $A_{\rm 0} = \sqrt{\hbar/(2\omega_c\epsilon_0V_{mode}})$ with $\omega_c$ the mode frequency, $V_{mode} = \eta\lambda_c^3$ the effective mode volume related to the compression factor $\eta$ and $\lambda_c$ the wavelength in free space that corresponds to $\omega_c$. The orientation of the cavity mode polarization is described by the unit vector $\mathbf{u} = (u_x, u_y, u_z)$.


Our treatment is based on the four-band continuum model for small angle twisted bilayer TMD \cite{Wu2019,Zhai2020}. The cavity QED Hamiltonian can be written as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Haldane-H4}
\hat{H} = \hbar\omega_c\hat{a}^{\dagger}\hat{a} + \begin{pmatrix}
        \hat{H}_{t} & 0 \\ 0 & \hat{H}_{b}
    \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix}
        \hat{V}_t & \hat{U} \\ \hat{U}^{\dagger} & \hat{V}_b
    \end{pmatrix},
\end{equation}
where the $2\cross2$ operator matrix $\hat{H}_{t}$ ($\hat{H}_{b}$)  corresponds to the conduction and valence bands of the top (bottom) layer. The moir\'{e} potentials are given by the last term.
%
The light-matter coupling is introduced via Peierls factors \footnote{See Supplementary Material for additional details about the cavity QED Hamiltonian, the purity of electronic reduced density matrix, the spectral functions and spatial distribution of edge states.} in the intralayer ($\hat{H}_{t}$, $\hat{H}_{b}$) and interlayer ($\hat{U}$) hopping terms.
We quantify the interaction strength by the dimensionless constant $g = eA_0 a_0/\hbar$.
For $g \ll 1$ and in the low-energy sector, each diagonal block matrix $\nu = t, b$ and interlayer coupling $\hat{U}$ can be approximated as follows:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:TMD-each H}
\begin{aligned}
    &\hat{H}_{\nu} = \Delta \sigma_z + v_F\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{xy} \cdot \left[\mathbf{\hat{p}} -\hbar\mathbf{K}_{\nu} + e\mathbf{A}^{(xy)}(\hat{a}+\hat{a}^{\dagger})\right], \\
    &\hat{U} = e^{-i\frac{eA^{(z)}d}{\hbar}(\hat{a}+\hat{a}^{\dagger})}\hat{U}_0,
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
with $\mathbf{K}_{t} = \boldsymbol{\kappa}_-$, $ \mathbf{K}_{b} = \boldsymbol{\kappa}_+$ shown in Fig. \ref{fig:TMD-mBZ}, $\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{xy} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, 0)$ a vector of Pauli matrices, $\mathbf{A}^{(xy)}$ is the in-plane projection of $A_0 {\mathbf u}$ and $A^{(z)}$ is its $z$-component. Note that the interlayer distance $d$ is much  larger than the in-plane lattice constant $a_0$. Hence, the argument of the Peierl's  exponential for the $U$ term is much larger than its $t$ counterpart (in-plane coupling). We will consider a regime of realistic parameters, where it turns out that the exponential of the $t$-term can be linearized, while the out-of-plane Peierls term must be kept in exponential form. The moir\'{e} potentials $\hat{V}_{\nu}$ and $\hat{U}_0$ are the same as the ones in \cite{Wu2019,Zhai2020}. Due to the large energy gap between the conduction and valence band in the TMD material, we can restrict our description to the latter, for which non-trivial topological properties were studied \cite{Wu2019,yu_giant_2020} in the absence of a cavity field. Finally, we represent the Hamiltonian in the hole picture. The corresponding Hamiltonian reads:
\begin{widetext}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:TMD-H1}
\begin{aligned}
    \hat{\mathcal{H}} = \hbar \omega_c \hat{a}^{\dagger}\hat{a}
    +\frac{1}{2m^{\star}}\begin{pmatrix}
   (\hat{\mathbf{p}} + \hbar\boldsymbol{\kappa}_-  - e\mathbf{A}^{(xy)}(\hat{a}+\hat{a}^{\dagger}))^2 & 0 \\
    0 & (\hat{\mathbf{p}} + \hbar\boldsymbol{\kappa}_+ -e\mathbf{A}^{(xy)}(\hat{a}+\hat{a}^{\dagger}))^2
    \end{pmatrix} 
    -  
    \begin{pmatrix}
    \hat{V}^v_t & \hat{U}_0^{v\dagger} \\ \hat{U}_0^{v} & \hat{V}^v_b    \end{pmatrix} - i\frac{\omega_ceA^{(z)}d}{2}(\hat{a}-\hat{a}^{\dagger})\tau_z
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\end{widetext}
where $m^{\star} = \Delta/v_F^2$ is the effective mass of the valence band, $\tau_z$ is the $z$-axis Pauli matrix with respect to the layer pseudospin. We have considered minimal coupling in the Coulomb gauge for the in-plane motion, while the dipole gauge resulting from a Power-Zienau-Woolley (PZW) transformation is used for the out-of-plane part. The expression for the moir\'{e} potentials $\hat{V}_t^v$, $\hat{V}_b^v$, $\hat{U}_0^v$ is the same as in \cite{Wu2019,Zhai2020} and is reported in the Supplemental Material. To account for the interlayer bias $V_z$ (that breaks the symmetry between $\boldsymbol{\kappa}_{+}$ and $\boldsymbol{\kappa}_-$ \cite{Wu2019}), the term $-V_z/2 \cross \tau_z$ has to be added to the Hamiltonian in Eq.  (\ref{eq:TMD-H1}). As the moir\'{e} potential is periodic with respect to $\mathbf{L}_{i=1,2}$ translations, the electronic part can be block-diagonalized in momentum space (Bloch theorem). Each block $\mathbf{k}$ belongs to the moir\'{e} mini Brillouin zone (mBZ) shown in Fig. \ref{fig:TMD-mBZ}, spanned by moir\'{e} reciprocal vectors $\mathbf{G}_1$ and $\mathbf{G}_2$ satisfying $\mathbf{G}_i\cdot\mathbf{L}_j = 2\pi\delta_{ij}$.

{\it Definition of the electron-photon Chern number ---} 
Let us consider a single fermion interacting with a cavity quantized field. This is equivalent to injecting a fermion into empty minibands.  If the fermion wavevector $\mathbf{k}$ is a good quantum number, then we can diagonalize the Hamiltonian  $\hat{\mathcal{H}}_{\mathbf{k}} = e^{-i\mathbf{k}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{r}}}\hat{\mathcal{H}}e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{r}}}$ and obtain electron-photon eigenstates of the form $\vert \Psi^{{\mathrm{(e-p})}}_{n\mathbf{k}}\rangle$ with  corresponding electron-photon energy bands $\mathcal{E}^{{\mathrm{(e-p})}}_{n\mathbf{k}}$. Given the form of the system eigenstates, we can introduce the following electron-photon Chern number:

  \caption{Electron-photon energy-momentum dispersions $\mathcal{E}^{(e-p)}_{n \mathbf{k}}$ for $g = 0.0$ (left panel) and $0.05$ (right panel) for a ribbon geometry (periodic boundary conditions along the long direction). Parameters: cavity photon energy $\hbar\omega_c = 6$ meV, $V_z = 0.5$ meV, $\theta = 1.2^{\circ}$, ribbon width $D_1/a_M = 10$ and cavity mode polarization vector $\mathbf{u} = (1,0,0)$. Here, the photonic component of the electron-photon eigenstates is small (see text).}
\label{fig:TMD-off res band}
\end{figure}
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{C}^{{\mathrm{(e-p})}}_n = \int\frac{d^2k}{2\pi}i\sum_{\mu,\nu}\epsilon_{\mu\nu}\braket{\smash{\partial_{k_{\mu}}\Psi^{{\mathrm{(e-p})}}_{n\mathbf{k}}}}{\smash{\partial_{k_{\nu}}\Psi^{{\mathrm{(e-p})}}_{n\mathbf{k}}}},
    \label{eq:Cn}
    \end{equation}
%\end{widetext}
where $\epsilon_{\mu\nu}$ is the two-dimensional Levi-Civita tensor. Importantly, the electron-photon Chern number in Eq. (\ref{eq:Cn}) is well defined for any arbitrary hybridization between the single electron and the cavity quantum field. If we work in the hole picture, the particle-hole transformation results in a simple change of sign of such Chern number. Numerically the Chern number in Eq. (\ref{eq:Cn}) has been calculated by numerical diagonalization of the Hamiltonian (\ref{eq:TMD-H1}) and using the technique reported in Ref. \cite{Zhao2020}.

%\section{Results and discussion}
{\it Results and discussions ---} In what follows, we
use the electron-photon Chern number to investigate topological properties of cavity-embedded moir\'e systems, focusing on twisted MoTe$_{2}$ bilayers. We first consider the scenario of high photon frequency, where the photon is off-resonant with respect to the relevant miniband electronic transitions. In Fig. \ref{fig:TMD-phase diagram}, we report the electron-photon topological Chern numbers associated to the first three moir\'e minibands of the twisted bilayer TMD system. Here, we consider a cavity mode with in-plane polarization $\mathbf{u} = (1,0,0)$. For $g = 0$ (no cavity coupling), the system is known to exhibit a topological transition as a function of the twisting angle $\theta$ (top panel) and as a function of the inter-layer bias $V_z$ (bottom panel). In the top panel we consider the case with no bias ($V_z = 0$) for which a topological transition occurs by increasing the twisting angle $\theta$ above a critical value ($\approx 1.75^{\circ}$ at zero $g$), with Chern numbers changing from $(+1,-1,0)$ to $(+1,+1,-2)$. The bottom panel corresponds to a situation with a fixed angle $\theta = 1.2^{\circ}$ for which a transition from topologically nontrivial Chern numbers $(+1,-1,0)$ to the trivial $(0,0,0)$  is achieved when $V_z$ is increased above a critical value ($\approx 0.63$ meV at zero $g$).

Note that this topological diagram cannot be predicted by the effective electronic model used in Fig. \ref{fig:TMD-phase diagram}. Other parameters: cavity photon energy $\hbar\omega_c = 10$ meV, $V_z = 0$ meV, and cavity mode polarization $\mathbf{u} = (0,0,1)$.}
\label{fig:TMD-on phase diagram}
\end{figure}
In both situations considered in Fig. \ref{fig:TMD-phase diagram}, a finite cavity coupling modifies the transition boundary significantly for a range of dimensionless coupling $g$, which is accessible with deeply sub-wavelength resonators. The energy-momentum dispersions with and without the cavity are compared for $V_z = 0.5$ meV in Fig. \ref{fig:TMD-off res band} for a ribbon geometry (periodic boundary conditions along the long direction). The left panel shows the presence of topological edge states that cross in energy for $g=0$, while the right panel shows the opening of an edge gap in the presence of a cavity with $g = 0.05$. In other words, Fig. \ref{fig:TMD-off res band} shows the consequence of the topological transition with increasing cavity coupling $g$ depicted in the diagram of the bottom panel in Fig. \ref{fig:TMD-phase diagram}. 

Note that by tracing out the photonic degrees of freedom, we can obtain an electronic reduced density matrix, namely $\hat{\rho}_{n\mathbf{k}} = \text{Tr}_{\text{phot}}\left(\ket{\smash{\Psi_{n\mathbf{k}}^{(e-p)}}}\bra{\smash{\Psi_{n\mathbf{k}}^{(e-p)}}}\right)$. The electronic purity of such reduced density matrix is defined as ${\mathbb P}_{n\mathbf{k}} = \text{Tr}_{\text{el}}(\hat{\rho}_{n\mathbf{k}}^2)$ \cite{CohenTannoudji2020} and is equal to $1$ for a purely electronic state. For $g = 0.1$, the minimum of the electronic purity (the purity depends on $\mathbf{k}$) is about $75\%$ for the top panel of Fig. \ref{fig:TMD-off res band} and $88\%$ for the bottom one. In such configuration, one might describe the system with an effective electronic Hamiltonian \cite{Arwas2023,Dmytruk2022,Wang2019,Li2022,Guerci_PRL_2020}. Indeed, we as shown in of Fig. \ref{fig:TMD-phase diagram} the diagrams are qualitatively reproduced by an effective electronic Hamiltonian approach (see Supplementary Material).
However our electron-photon Chern number introduced in Eq. (\ref{eq:Cn}) and based on the exact light-matter energies $\mathcal{E}^{(e-p)}_{n \mathbf{k}}$ is defined also for low electronic purity, i.e., for any arbitrary light-matter hybridization.

We have considered a ribbon geometry with width $D_1/a_M = 10$ and periodic boundary conditions along the long direction. Other parameters: cavity photon energy $\hbar\omega_c = 10$ meV, $V_z = 0$ meV, $\theta = 1.8^{\circ}$, cavity mode polarization $\mathbf{u} = (0,0,1)$. }
\label{fig:res-band}
\end{figure}
\label{discuss}


\label{res}
Let us now consider the situation where the cavity mode has a relatively low frequency and is resonant with electronic miniband transitions. Note that we consider here out-of-plane cavity polarization $\mathbf{u} = (0,0,1)$ and the corresponding dimensionless coupling constant is defined as $g_{\perp} = eA_0d/\hbar$. The corresponding results are depicted in Fig. \ref{fig:TMD-on phase diagram} and \ref{fig:res-band}. In the non-interacting case ($g_{\perp}=0$), the photon energy creates replicas of the electronic minibands with non-zero photon numbers, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:res-band}. The bare electron-photon spectrum becomes degenerate when a photon replica crosses the original electronic miniband with zero photons.
However, a finite coupling lifts such degeneracies, leading to new electron-photon energy minibands for which we can compute the electron-photon Chern number.
Fig. \ref{fig:TMD-on phase diagram} shows the topological diagram characterized by such an electron-photon Chern numbers for the first four minibands. The cavity photon energy is resonant to the transition  between the first and third electronic minibands, depicted in Fig. \ref{fig:res-band}.  The bulk-edge correspondence for the electron-photon Chern number is  satisfied: indeed, we observe three edge states shown by the thicker red line in Fig. \ref{fig:res-band}. These states have low electronic purity (as low as 50\%) and cannot be captured by an effective electronic Hamiltonian where the photon degrees of freedom are eliminated. Moreover, such high Chern numbers, created by the hybridization with the cavity photon replicas, are absent in the bare electronic system. These multiple new edge states corresponding to high Chern numbers can be observed by measuring the electronic spectral function via Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) \cite{Noguchi2021}, Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) \cite{Tao2011} or Microwave Impedance Microscopy \cite{Barber2021}.
%\subsection{Discussion}

{\it Conclusions ---} In this letter, we explored the new topological phases characterized  by the electron-photon Chern number, a topological invariant defined in terms of the exact eigenstates for the Hamiltonian describing a fermionic particle coupled to a quantized electromagnetic field. This is a topological invariant for any arbitrary hybridization of the electron-photon eigenstates. 
Note that electron-photon Chern numbers can also defined for disordered and non-homogeneous systems \cite{Prodan2010,Bianco2011,Zhang2013,Caio2019}, so the present topological approach can also be generalized to situations where the cavity mode is not spatially homogeneous or in the presence of electronic disorder. The results of this letter are exact when a single fermion is injected in empty minibands. A future and intriguing problem to explore is how these topological states evolve when such electron-photon states are partially filled.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusoin}

In this paper, our proposed new \model\ model discovers users' genuine interests from conformity to enhance sequential recommendation performance while mitigating popularity bias. The proposed debaised contrastive learning effectively reduces the impact of popularity bias in data augmentation for sequential recommender systems. Through comprehensive experiments, our \model\ has been shown to be effective, achieving superior results compared to other baselines. In our future work, it would be interesting to investigate methods for automatically searching neural parameters in conjunction with our interest and conformity disentanglement, with the aim of further improving our sequential recommender.

% In this paper, we aim to disentangle the real interest and conformity of users to improve sequential recommendation against popularity bias. To achieve this goal, we propose a new self-supervised recommender \model\ which automatically distills the conformity-aware contrastive augmented signals. This works shed light on the limitation of state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods for sequential recommendation. The proposed general solution effectively alleviates the influence of popularity bias in data augmentation for sequential recommender system. Through extensive experiments, our \model\ is demonstrated to be effective by obtaining superior results. Notably, \model\ also shows impressive performance against data sparsity. In our future work, we would like to explore how to automatically search neural parameters with our interest and conformity disentanglement, to enhance our sequential recommender.

    abstract = { Networks and the epidemiology of directly transmitted infectious diseases are fundamentally linked. The foundations of epidemiology and early epidemiological models were based on population wide random-mixing, but in practice each individual has a finite set of contacts to whom they can pass infection; the ensemble of all such contacts forms a ?mixing network?. Knowledge of the structure of the network allows models to compute the epidemic dynamics at the population scale from the individual-level behaviour of infections. Therefore, characteristics of mixing networks?and how these deviate from the random-mixing norm?have become important applied concerns that may enhance the understanding and prediction of epidemic patterns and intervention measures. Here, we review the basis of epidemiological theory (based on random-mixing models) and network theory (based on work from the social sciences and graph theory). We then describe a variety of methods that allow the mixing network, or an approximation to the network, to be ascertained. It is often the case that time and resources limit our ability to accurately find all connections within a network, and hence a generic understanding of the relationship between network structure and disease dynamics is needed. Therefore, we review some of the variety of idealized network types and approximation techniques that have been utilized to elucidate this link. Finally, we look to the future to suggest how the two fields of network theory and epidemiological modelling can deliver an improved understanding of disease dynamics and better public health through effective disease control. }

The N-intertwined approximation, the HMF approximation, and the $\epsilon$-SIS spreading model are compared for different graph types. We focus on the epidemic threshold and the steady-state fraction of infected nodes in networks with different degree distributions. Overall, the N-intertwined approximation is superior to the HMF approximation. The N-intertwined approximation is exactly the same as the HMF approximation in regular graphs. However, for some special graph types, such as the square lattice graph and the path graph, the two mean-field approximations are both very different from the $\epsilon$-SIS spreading model. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Why do some contagions " go viral" and others do not? Research on " small world" networks (Watts and Strogatz, 1998) shows how a very small number of long-range ties that bridge between clusters can allow contagions to spread almost as rapidly as on a random network of equal density. Recent research shows how long-range ties that accelerate the spread of information and disease can impede the spread of complex contagions-behaviors, beliefs and preferences that diffuse via contact with multiple adopters (Centola and Macy, 2007). In confirming this result analytically and extending the analysis from small world to power law networks, we discovered that complex contagions require a critical mass of infected nodes that corresponds to a phase transition in the ability of the contagion to take advantage of the " shortcuts" created by long-range ties. We demonstrate how this critical mass is related to the dynamics of the contagion process and identify implications for modeling behaviors that spread via social influence, such as viral marketing and social movements. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

abstract = {Since the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) epidemic threshold is not precisely defined in spite of its practical importance, the classical SIS epidemic process has been generalized to the -SIS model, where a node possesses a self-infection rate, in addition to a link infection rate $\beta$ and a curing rate $\delta$. The exact Markov equations are derived, from which the steady state can be computed. The major advantage of the -SIS model is that its steady state is different from the absorbing (or overall-healthy state) and approximates, for a certain range of small {\textgreater}0, the in reality observed phase transition, also called the "metastable" state, that is characterized by the epidemic threshold. The exact steady-state analysis for the complete graph illustrates the effect of small and the quality of the first-order mean-field approximation, the N-intertwined model, proposed earlier. Apart from duality principles, often used in the mathematical literature, we present an exact recursion relation for the Markov infinitesimal generator. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Physical Society.},

In particular, individual-based epidemic models isolate the impact of the network topology on spreading dynamics. In this paper, the existing models are generalized to develop a class of models that includes the spreading process in multilayer complex networks. We provide a detailed description of the stochastic process at the agent level where the agents interact through different layers, each represented by a graph. The set of differential equations that describes the time evolution of the state occupancy probabilities has an exponentially growing state-space size in terms of the number of the agents. Based on a mean-field type approximation, we developed a set of nonlinear differential equations that has linearly growing state-space size.We find that the latter system, referred to as the generalized epidemicmean-field (GEMF) model, has a simple structure characterized by the elements of the adjacency matrices of the network layers and the Laplacian matrices of the transition rate graphs. Finally, we present several examples of epidemic models, including spreading of virus and information in computer networks and spreading ofmultiple pathogens in a host population.},

@article{Karrer2011,
abstract = {Human diseases spread over networks of contacts between individuals and a substantial body of recent research has focused on the dynamics of the spreading process. Here we examine a model of two competing diseases spreading over the same network at the same time, where infection with either disease gives an individual subsequent immunity to both. Using a combination of analytic and numerical methods, we derive the phase diagram of the system and estimates of the expected final numbers of individuals infected with each disease. The system shows an unusual dynamical transition between dominance of one disease and dominance of the other as a function of their relative rates of growth. Close to this transition the final outcomes show strong dependence on stochastic fluctuations in the early stages of growth, dependence that decreases with increasing network size, but does so sufficiently slowly as still to be easily visible in systems with millions or billions of individuals. In most regions of the phase diagram we find that one disease eventually dominates while the other reaches only a vanishing fraction of the network, but the system also displays a significant coexistence regime in which both diseases reach epidemic proportions and infect an extensive fraction of the network. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Models of epidemic spreading on complex networks have attracted great attention among researchers in physics, mathematics, and epidemiology due to their success in predicting and controlling scenarios of epidemic spreading in real-world scenarios. To understand the interplay between epidemic spreading and the topology of a contact network, several outstanding theoretical approaches have been developed. An accurate theoretical approach describing the spreading dynamics must take both the network topology and dynamical correlations into consideration at the expense of increasing the complexity of the equations. In this short survey we unify the most widely used theoretical approaches for epidemic spreading on complex networks in terms of increasing complexity, including the mean-field, the heterogeneous mean-field, the quench mean-field, dynamical message-passing, link percolation, and pairwise approximation. We build connections among these approaches to provide new insights into developing an accurate theoretical approach to spreading dynamics on complex networks.},

Pair-approximation models and individual-based network simulation have been used extensively to model contact networks with non-trivial properties. In this paper, using a continuous time Markov chain, we start from the exact formulation of a simple epidemic model on an arbitrary contact network and rigorously derive and prove some known results that were previously mainly justified based on some biological hypotheses. The main result of the paper is the illustration of the link between graph automorphisms and the process of lumping whereby the number of equations in a system of linear differential equations can be significantly reduced. The main advantage of lumping is that the simplified lumped system is not an approximation of the original system but rather an exact version of this. For a special class of graphs, we show how the lumped system can be obtained by using graph automorphisms. Finally, we discuss the advantages and possible applications of exact epidemic models and lumping. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

Using this framework and data from the Framingham Heart Study, we provide formal evidence that positive and negative emotional states behave like infectious diseases spreading across social networks over long periods of time. The probability of becoming content is increased by 0.02 per year for each content contact, and the probability of becoming discontent is increased by 0.04 per year per discontent contact. Our mathematical formalism allows us to derive various quantities from the data, such as the average lifetime of a contentment 'infection' (10 years) or discontentment 'infection' (5 years). Our results give insight into the transmissive nature of positive and negative emotional states. Determining to what extent particular emotions or behaviours are infectious is a promising direction for further research with important implications for social science, epidemiology and health policy. Our model provides a theoretical framework for studying the interpersonal spread of any state that may also arise spontaneously, such as emotions behaviours, health states, ideas or diseases with reservoirs. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Infectious diseases are studied to understand their spreading mechanisms, to evaluate control strategies and to predict the risk and course of future outbreaks. Because people only interact with few other individuals, and the structure of these interactions influence spreading processes, the pairwise relationships between individuals can be usefully represented by a network. Although the underlying transmission processes are different, the network approach can be used to study the spread of pathogens in a contact network or the spread of rumours in a social network. We study simulated simple and complex epidemics on synthetic networks and on two empirical networks, a social/contact network in an Indian village and an online social network. Our goal is to learn simultaneously the spreading process parameters and the first infected node, given a fixed network structure and the observed state of nodes at several time points. Our inference scheme is based on approximate Bayesian computation, a likelihood-free inference technique. Our method is agnostic about the network topology and the spreading process. It generally performs well and, somewhat counter-intuitively, the inference problem appears to be easier on more heterogeneous network topologies, which enhances its future applicability to real-world settings where few networks have homogeneous topologies.},

abstract = {Since the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) epidemic threshold is not precisely defined in spite of its practical importance, the classical SIS epidemic process has been generalized to the -SIS model, where a node possesses a self-infection rate, in addition to a link infection rate $\beta$ and a curing rate $\delta$. The exact Markov equations are derived, from which the steady state can be computed. The major advantage of the -SIS model is that its steady state is different from the absorbing (or overall-healthy state) and approximates, for a certain range of small {\textgreater}0, the in reality observed phase transition, also called the "metastable" state, that is characterized by the epidemic threshold. The exact steady-state analysis for the complete graph illustrates the effect of small and the quality of the first-order mean-field approximation, the N-intertwined model, proposed earlier. Apart from duality principles, often used in the mathematical literature, we present an exact recursion relation for the Markov infinitesimal generator. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Physical Society.},

This is accomplished for networks that are of finite-size and of arbitrary topology. This paper determines which network configuration is the most probable. We prove that, for a range of epidemic parameters, this combinatorial inference problem leads to a submodular optimization problem, which can be solved in polynomial time. We relate the most-probable configuration to the network structure, and in particular to the existence of high-density subgraphs. Depending on the model parameters, subset of agents may be more likely to be infected than others; these more vulnerable agents form subgraphs that are denser than the overall network. We illustrate our results with a 193 node social network of drug users and with the 4941 node Western US power grid under different model parameters.}",

abstract = {Peer influence and interactions between agents in a population give rise to complex, nonlinear behaviors. This paper adopts the SIS (susceptible-infected- susceptible) framework from epidemiology to analytically study how network topology affects the diffusion of ideas/opinions/beliefs/innovations in social networks. We introduce the scaled SIS process, which models peer influence as neighbor-to-neighbor infections. We model the scaled SIS process as a continuous-time Markov process and derive for this process its closed form equilibrium distribution. The adjacency matrix that describes the underlying social network is explicitly reflected in this distribution. The paper shows that interesting population asymptotic behaviors occur for scenarios where the individual tendencies of each agent oppose peer influences. Specifically, we determine how the most probable configuration of agent states (i.e., the population configuration with maximum equilibrium distribution) depends on both model parameters and network topology. We show that, for certain regions of the parameter space, this and related issues reduce to standard graph questions like the maximum independent set problem. {\textcopyright} 2007-2012 IEEE.},

@article{Zhang2017,
abstract = {Propagation of contagion in networks depends on the graph topology. This article is concerned with studying the time-asymptotic behaviour of the extended contact processes on static, undirected, finite-size networks. This is a contact process with nonzero exogenous infection rate (also known as the $\epsilon$-susceptible-infectedsusceptible model). The only known analytical characterization of the equilibrium distribution of this process is for complete networks. For large networks with arbitrary topology, it is infeasible to numerically solve for the equilibrium distribution since it requires solving the eigenvalue-eigenvector problem of a matrix that is exponential in N, the size of the network. We derive a condition on the infection rates under which, depending on the degree distribution of the network, the equilibrium distribution of extended contact processes on arbitrary, finite-size networks is well approximated by a closed-form formulation. We confirm the goodness of the approximation with small networks answering inference questions like the distribution of the percentage of infected individuals and the most-probable equilibrium configuration. We then use the approximation to analyse the equilibrium distribution of the extended contact process on the 4941-node US Western power grid.},

Various models have been proposed for these phenomena, but empirical evidence of their accuracy as real-world predictive tools has so far been absent. Here we find that a 'complex contagion' model accurately describes the spread of behaviours driven by online sharing. We found that standard, 'simple', contagion often fails to capture both the rapid spread and the long tails of popularity seen in real fads, where our complex contagion model succeeds. Complex contagion also has predictive power: it successfully predicted the peak time and duration of the ALS Icebucket Challenge. The fast spread and longer duration of fads driven by complex contagion has important implications for activities such as publicity campaigns and charity drives.},

Special emphasis is placed on the assumptions that un- derly all causal inferences, the languages used in formulating those assump- tions, the conditional nature of all causal and counterfactual claims, and the methods that have been developed for the assessment of such claims. These advances are illustrated using a general theory of causation based on the Structural Causal Model (SCM) described in Pearl (2000a), which subsumes and unifies other approaches to causation, and provides a coher- entmathematical foundation for the analysis of causes and counterfactuals. In particular, the paper surveys the development of mathematical tools for inferring (from a combination of data and assumptions) answers to three types of causal queries: (1) queries about the effects of potential interven- tions, (also called “causal effects” or “policy evaluation”) (2) queries about probabilities of counterfactuals, (including assessment of “regret,” “attri- bution” or “causes of effects”) and (3) queries about direct and indirect effects (also known as “mediation”). Finally, the paper defines the formal and conceptual relationships between the structural and potential-outcome frameworks and presents tools for a symbiotic analysis that uses the strong features of both.},

However, using contagion data to infer network structure is a challenging inverse problem. In particular, it is imperative to have appropriate measures of uncertainty in network structure estimates, however these are largely ignored in most machine-learning approaches. We present a probabilistic framework that uses samples from the distribution of networks that are compatible with the dynamics observed to produce network and uncertainty estimates. We demonstrate the method using the well known independent cascade model to sample from the distribution of networks P(G) conditioned on the observation of a set of infections C. We evaluate the accuracy of the method by using the marginal probabilities of each edge in the distribution, and show the bene ts of quantifying uncertainty to improve estimates and understanding, particularly with small amounts of data.},

We develop an observation model for the epidemic process, and demonstrate that if the set of observed nodes is sufficiently well structured, then the random variables which denote the process' infections are conditionally independent given the observations. We then leverage the attained conditional independence property to construct tractable mechanisms for the inference and prediction of the process state, avoiding the need to use mean field approximations or combinatorial representations. We conclude by formulating a one-step lookahead controller for the discrete-time Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) epidemic process which leverages the developed Bayesian inference and prediction mechanisms, and causes the epidemic to die out at a chosen rate.},

abstract = {Contact network epidemiology is an approach to modeling the spread of infectious diseases that explicitly considers patterns of person-to-person contacts within a community. Contacts can be asymmetric, with a person more likely to infect one of their contacts than to become infected by that contact. This is true for some sexually transmitted diseases that are more easily caught by women than men during heterosexual encounters; and for severe infectious diseases that cause an average person to seek medical attention and thereby potentially infect health care workers (HCWs) who would not, in turn, have an opportunity to infect that average person. Here we use methods from percolation theory to develop a mathematical framework for predicting disease transmission through semi-directed contact networks in which some contacts are undirected-the probability of transmission is symmetric between individuals-and others are directed-transmission is possible only in one direction. We find that the probability of an epidemic and the expected fraction of a population infected during an epidemic can be different in semi-directed networks, in contrast to the routine assumption that these two quantities are equal. We furthermore demonstrate that these methods more accurately predict the vulnerability of HCWs and the efficacy of various hospital-based containment strategies during outbreaks of severe respiratory diseases. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Many real networks are not isolated from each other but form networks of networks, often interrelated in nontrivial ways. Here, we analyze an epidemic spreading process taking place on top of two interconnected complex networks. We develop a heterogeneous mean-field approach that allows us to calculate the conditions for the emergence of an endemic state. Interestingly, a global endemic state may arise in the coupled system even though the epidemics is not able to propagate on each network separately and even when the number of coupling connections is small. Our analytic results are successfully confronted against large-scale numerical simulations. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {In this paper, the parameter estimation problem is investigated for the continuous time stochastic logistic diffusion system. A new continuous process is built based on the likelihood ratio scheme, the Radon-Nikodym derivative and the explicit expressions of the error of estimation are given under this new continuous process. By using the random time transformations, law of large numbers for martingales, law of iterated logarithm and stationary distribution of solution, the consistency property are proved for the estimation error. Finally, a numerical simulation is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in this paper.},

@article{Centola2007,
abstract = {The strength of weak ties is that they tend to be long—they connect socially distant locations, allowing information to diffuse rapidly. The authors test whether this “strength of weak ties” generalizes from simple to complex contagions. Complex contagions require social affirmation from multiple sources. Examples include the spread of high-risk social movements, avant garde fashions, and unproven technologies. Results show that as adoption thresholds increase, long ties can impede diffusion. Complex contagions depend primarily on the width of the bridges across a network, not just their length.Wide bridges are a characteristic feature of manyspatial networks, which may account in part for the widely observed ten- dency for social movements to diffuse spatially.},

abstract = {TThis book is an introduction to the modern approach to the theory of Markov chains. The main goal of this approach is to determine the rate of convergence of a Markov chain to the stationary distribution as a function of the size and geometry of the state space. The authors develop the key tools for estimating convergence times, including coupling, strong stationary times, and spectral methods. Whenever possible, probabilistic methods are emphasized. The book includes many examples and provides brief introductions to some central models of statistical mechanics. Also provided are accounts of random walks on networks, including hitting and cover times, and analyses of several methods of shuffling cards. As a prerequisite, the authors assume a modest understanding of probability theory and linear algebra at an undergraduate level. Markov Chains and Mixing Times is meant to bring the excitement of this active area of research to a wide audience.},

abstract = {We introduce a multivariate random process producing Bernoulli outputs per dimension, that can possibly formalize binary interactions in various graphical structures and can be used to model opinion dynamics, epidemics, financial and biological time series data, etc. We call this a Bernoulli Autoregressive Process (BAR). While many dynamical models of processes on graphs have been studied previously, the main feature of our model is that it provides a parsimonious description of a Markov chain with non-reversible dynamics in general, which may be important in some applications. The goal is to learn the causal connectivity of the underlying graph from time-series data, assuming that the connectivity is sparse. Not surprisingly, the simplicity of the model leads to a simple and natural learning algorithm. However, proving the near-optimal sample complexity of the algorithm is non-trivial. The sample complexity is related to the mixing time of the BAR Markov chain, which is hard to estimate because of the lack of reversibility. A key contribution of the paper is an upper bound on the mixing time based on coupling arguments and a probabilistic inequality which may itself be of independent interest.},

abstract = {In this paper we describe how MAP inference can be used to sample efficiently from Gibbs distributions. Specifically, we provide means for drawing either approximate or unbiased samples from Gibbs' distributions by introducing low dimensional perturbations and solving the corresponding MAP assignments. Our approach also leads to new ways to derive lower bounds on partition functions. We demonstrate empirically that our method excels in the typical "high signal-high coupling" regime. The setting results in ragged energy landscapes that are challenging for alternative approaches to sampling and/or lower bounds.},

Our particular focus in this example is on the way the properties of the exponential distribution allow us to proceed with the calculations. This will give us a good starting point for considering how these properties can be used to build up more general processes, namely continuous-time Markov chains. Example: (Ross, p.338 {\#}48(a)). Consider an n-server parallel queue-ing system where customers arrive according to a Poisson process with rate $\lambda$, where the service times are exponential random variables with rate µ, and where any arrival finding all servers busy immediately de-parts without receiving any service. If an arrival finds all servers busy, find (a) the expected number of busy servers found by the next arrival.},

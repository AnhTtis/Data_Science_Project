    "abstract": "Let $G$ (resp. $H$) be the group of orientation preserving self-homeomorphisms of the unit circle (resp. real line). In previous work, the first two authors constructed pre-Tannakian categories $\\underline{\\mathrm{Rep}}(G)$ and $\\underline{\\mathrm{Rep}}(H)$ associated to these groups. In the predecessor to this paper, we analyzed the category $\\underline{\\mathrm{Rep}}(H)$ (which we named the ``Delannoy category'') in great detail, and found it to have many special properties. In this paper, we study $\\underline{\\mathrm{Rep}}(G)$. The primary difference between these two categories is that $\\underline{\\mathrm{Rep}}(H)$ is semi-simple, while $\\underline{\\mathrm{Rep}}(G)$ is not; this introduces new complications in the present case. We find that $\\underline{\\mathrm{Rep}}(G)$ is closely related to the combinatorics of objects we call Delannoy loops, which seem to have not previously been studied.",

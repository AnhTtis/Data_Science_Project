\section{Limitation}
\vspace{-3pt}
Although ScribbleSeg shows great performance across different benchmarks, this version of the model would only be applicable to natural images as it is only trained on COCO~\cite{lin2014coco} and LVIS~\cite{gupta2019lvis}. If we want to use it on other domains like industrial defects and medical images, we have to collect data from the target domain and finetune the model.

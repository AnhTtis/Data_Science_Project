    "abstract": "The paper studies equilibrium configurations of inextensible elastic membranes exhibiting lateral fluidity. Differential equations governing the mechanical equilibrium are derived using a continuum description of the membrane motions given by the surface Navier--Stokes equations with bending forces. Equilibrium conditions are found to be independent of lateral viscosity and relate tension, pressure and tangential velocity of the fluid. The conditions yield that only surfaces with Killing vector fields, such as axisymmetric shapes, can support non-zero stationary flow of mass. A shape equation is derived that extends a classical Helfrich model with area constraint to membranes of non-negligible mass. A simple numerical method to compute solutions of the shape equation is suggested. Numerical experiments reveal a diverse family of equilibrium configurations.",

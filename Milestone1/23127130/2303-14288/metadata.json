    "abstract": "Many forecasting applications have a limited distributed target variable, which is zero for most observations and positive for the remaining observations. In the econometrics literature, there is much research about statistical model building for limited distributed target variables. Especially, there are two component model approaches, where one model is build for the probability of the target to be positive and one model for the actual value of the target, given that it is positive. However, the econometric literature focuses on effect estimation and does not provide theory for predictive modeling. Nevertheless, some concepts like the two component model approach and Heckmann's sample selection correction also appear in the predictive modeling literature, without a sound theoretical foundation. In this paper, we theoretically analyze predictive modeling for limited dependent variables and derive best practices. By analyzing various real-world data sets, we also use the derived theoretical results to explain which predictive modeling approach works best on which application.",

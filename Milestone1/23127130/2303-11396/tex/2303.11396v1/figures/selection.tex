    In the refinement stage, the sequence of viewpoints are automatically determined by selecting the viewpoint with the maximum normalized area of the ``update'' region at each step. We update 2D views in the ``update'' regions with a moderate diffusion denoising strength. The updated object appearance is then back-projected to the texture space at the end of each refinement step.}

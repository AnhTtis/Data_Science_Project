    We dynamically partition the current view into a generation mask to guide the depth-aware inpainting model. For the ``new'' region, we denoise the new object appearance from white Gaussian noise. For the ``update'' region, we refine the previous texture by denoising the partially noised image segments. We freeze the texture in the ``keep'' region for this view.}

    Overview of \ARCH.
    We illustrate the pipeline using a 3D car mesh with a prompt ``\textit{golden Porsche}".
    We progressively generate the texture via a \textit{generate-then-refine} scheme. 
    In \textbf{progressive texture generation} (Sec.~\ref{sec: generation}), we start by rendering the object from an initial preset viewpoint. We generate a new appearance according to the input prompt via a depth-to-image diffusion model, and project the generated image back to the partial texture. Then, we repeat this process until the last preset viewpoint to output the initial textured mesh. 
    In the subsequent \textbf{texture refinement } (Sec.~\ref{sec: refinement}), we update the initial texture from a sequence of automatically selected viewpoints to refine the stretched and blurry artifacts.

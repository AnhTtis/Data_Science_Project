    "abstract": "We carry out hydrodynamical simulations to study the eccentricity growth of a 1-30 Jupiter mass planet located inside the fixed cavity of a protoplanetary disc. The planet exchanges energy and angular momentum with the disc at resonant locations, and its eccentricity grows due to Lindblad resonances. We observe several phases of eccentricity growth where different eccentric Lindblad resonances dominate from 1:3 up to 3:5. The maximum values of eccentricity reached in our simulations are 0.65-0.75. We calculate the eccentricity growth rate for different planet masses and disc parameters and derive analytical dependencies on these parameters. We observe that the growth rate is proportional to both the planet's mass and the characteristic disc mass for a wide range of parameters. In a separate set of simulations, we derived the width of the 1:3 Lindblad resonance.",

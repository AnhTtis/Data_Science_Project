    "abstract": "The maximum likelihood method is the best-known method for estimating the probabilities behind the data. However, the conventional method obtains the probability model closest to the empirical distribution, resulting in overfitting. Then regularization methods prevent the model from being excessively close to the wrong probability, but little is known systematically about their performance. The idea of regularization is similar to error-correcting codes, which obtain optimal decoding by mixing suboptimal solutions with an incorrectly received code. The optimal decoding in error-correcting codes is achieved based on gauge symmetry. We propose a theoretically guaranteed regularization in the maximum likelihood method by focusing on a gauge symmetry in Kullback -- Leibler divergence. In our approach, we obtain the optimal model without the need to search for hyperparameters frequently appearing in regularization.",

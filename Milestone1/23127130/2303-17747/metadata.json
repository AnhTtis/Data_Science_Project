    "abstract": "Building on a classification of zeros of cubic equations due to the $12$-th century Persian mathematician Sharaf al-Din Tusi, together with Smale's theory of {\\it point estimation}, we derive an efficient recipe for computing high-precision approximation to a real root of an arbitrary real cubic equation. First, via reversible transformations we reduce any real cubic equation into one of four canonical forms with $0$, $\\pm 1$ coefficients, except for the constant term as $\\pm q$, $q \\geq 0$. Next, given any form, if $ρ_q$ is an approximation to $\\sqrt[3]{q}$ to within a relative error of five percent, we prove a {\\it seed} $x_0$ in $\\{ ρ_q, \\pm .95 ρ_q, -\\frac{1}{3}, 1 \\}$ can be selected such that in $t$ Newton iterations $|x_t - θ_q| \\leq \\sqrt[3]{q}\\cdot 2^{-2^{t}}$ for some real root $θ_q$. While computing a good seed, even for approximation of $\\sqrt[3]{q}$, is considered to be ``somewhat of black art'' (see Wikipedia), as we justify, $ρ_q$ is readily computable from {\\it mantissa} and {\\it exponent} of $q$. It follows that the above approach gives a simple recipe for numerical approximation of solutions of real cubic equations independent of Cardano's formula.",

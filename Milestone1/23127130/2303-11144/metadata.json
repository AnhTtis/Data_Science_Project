    "abstract": "In this work we present the latest developments in the SAMPA-SRS integration. A software was developed to improve the acquisition configuration, acquisition, and decoding of the data. The complete framework was tested using a triple GEM-based position sensitive detector for X-rays. The detector was operated in Ar/CO$_2$ (70/30) in continuous flow, at atmospheric pressure and made use of a 1 dimension strip readout (200$μ$m wide strips at a pitch of 400$μ$m) for charge collection. With this detector a position resolution of better than 833$μ$m was obtained, with an energy resolution of 14.2% ($σ/E$) for 5.9keV.",

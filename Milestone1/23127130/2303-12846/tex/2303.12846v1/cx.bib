@article{Kremer2022,
abstract = {Recent analyses have shown that close encounters between stars and stellar black holes occur frequently in dense star clusters. Depending upon the distance at closest approach, these interactions can lead to dissipating encounters such as tidal captures and disruptions, or direct physical collisions, all of which may be accompanied by bright electromagnetic transients. In this study, we perform a wide range of hydrodynamic simulations of close encounters between black holes and main-sequence stars that collectively cover the parameter space of interest, and we identify and classify the various possible outcomes. In the case of nearly head-on collisions, the star is completely disrupted with roughly half of the stellar material becoming bound to the black hole. For more distant encounters near the classical tidal-disruption radius, the star is only partially disrupted on the first pericenter passage. Depending upon the interaction details, the partially disrupted stellar remnant may be tidally captured by the black hole or become unbound (in some cases, receiving a sufficiently large impulsive kick from asymmetric mass loss to be ejected from its host cluster). In the former case, the star will undergo additional pericenter passages before ultimately being disrupted fully. Based on the properties of the material bound to the black hole at the end of our simulations (in particular, the total bound mass and angular momentum), we comment upon the expected accretion process and associated electromagnetic signatures that are likely to result.},

@article{Wang2021,
abstract = {In dense star clusters, such as globular and open clusters, dynamical interactions between stars and black holes (BHs) can be extremely frequent, leading to various astrophysical transients. Close encounters between a star and a stellar mass BH make it possible for the star to be tidally disrupted by the BH. Due to the relative low mass of the BH and the small cross-section of the tidal disruption event (TDE) for cases with high penetration, disruptions caused by close encounters are usually partial disruptions. The existence of the remnant stellar core and its non-negligible mass compared to the stellar mass BH alters the accretion process significantly. We study this problem with SPH simulations using the code Phantom, with the inclusion of radiation pressure, which is important for small mass BHs. Additionally, we develop a new, more general method of computing the fallback rate which does not rely on any approximation. Our study shows that the powerlaw slope of the fallback rate has a strong dependence on the mass of the BH in the stellar mass BH regime. Furthermore, in this regime, self-gravity of the fallback stream and local instabilities become more significant, and cause the disrupted material to collapse into small clumps before returning to the BH. This results in an abrupt increase of the fallback rate, which can significantly deviate from a powerlaw. Our results will help in the identification of TDEs by stellar mass BHs in dense clusters.},

@article{Zrake2021,
abstract = { Using high-resolution hydrodynamics simulations, we show that equal-mass binaries accreting from a circumbinary disk evolve toward an orbital eccentricity of e ≃ 0.45, unless they are initialized on a nearly circular orbit with e ≲ 0.08, in which case they further circularize. The implied bi-modal eccentricity distribution resembles that seen in post-AGB stellar binaries. Large accretion spikes around periapse impart a tell-tale, quasiperiodic, bursty signature on the light curves of eccentric binaries. We predict that intermediate-mass and massive black hole binaries at z ≲ 10 entering the LISA band will have measurable eccentricities in the range of e ≃ 10 −3 − 10 −2 , if they have experienced a gas-driven phase. On the other hand, GW190521 would have entered the LIGO/Virgo band with undetectable eccentricity ∼10 −6 if it had been driven into the gravitational-wave regime by a gas disk. },

abstract = {Flares from tidal disruption events are unique tracers of quiescent black holes at the centre of galaxies. The appearance of these flares is very sensitive to whether the star is totally or partially disrupted, and in this paper we seek to identify the critical distance of the star from the black hole (rd) that enables us to distinguish between these two outcomes. We perform here mesh-free finite mass, traditional, and modern smoothed particle hydrodynamical simulations of star-black hole close encounters, with the aim of checking if the value of rd depends on the simulation technique. We find that the critical distance (or the so-called critical disruption parameter $\beta$d) depends only weakly on the adopted simulation method, being $\beta$d = 0.92 ± 0.02 for a $\gamma$ = 5/3 polytrope and $\beta$d = 2.01 ± 0.01 for a $\gamma$ = 4/3 polytrope.},

@article{Lombardi2006,
abstract = {We report the results of new SPH calculations of parabolic collisions between a subgiant or slightly evolved red giant star and a neutron star (NS). Such collisions are likely to provide the dominant formation mechanism for ultracompact X-ray binaries (UCXBs) observed today in old globular clusters. In particular, we compute collisions of a 1.4 Msolar NS with realistically modeled parent stars of initial masses 0.8 and 0.9 Msolar, each at three different evolutionary stages (corresponding to three different core masses mc and radii R). The distance of closest approach for the initial orbit varies from rp=0.04R (nearly head-on) to 1.3R (grazing). These collisions lead to the formation of a tight binary, composed of the NS and the subgiant or red giant core, embedded in an extremely diffuse common envelope (CE) typically of mass $\sim$0.1-0.3 Msolar. Our calculations follow the binary for many hundreds of orbits, ensuring that the orbital parameters we determine at the end of the calculations are close to final. Some of the fluid initially in the giant's envelope, from 0.003 to 0.023 Msolar in the cases we considered, is left bound to the NS. The eccentricities of the resulting binaries range from about 0.2 for our most grazing collision to about 0.9 for the nearly head-on cases. In almost all the cases we consider, gravitational radiation alone will cause sufficiently fast orbital decay to form a UCXB within a Hubble time, and often on a much shorter timescale. Our hydrodynamics code implements the recent SPH equations of motion derived with a variational approach by Springel & Hernquist and by Monaghan. Numerical noise is reduced by enforcing an analytic constraint equation that relates the smoothing lengths and densities of SPH particles. We present tests of these new methods to help demonstrate their improved accuracy.},

abstract = {The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, LIGO, found direct evidence for double black hole binaries emitting gravitational waves. Galactic nuclei are expected to harbor the densest population of stellar-mass black holes. A significant fraction ($\sim30\%$) of these black holes can reside in binaries. We examine the fate of the black hole binaries in active galactic nuclei, which get trapped in the inner region of the accretion disk around the central supermassive black hole. We show that binary black holes can migrate into and then rapidly merge within the disk well within a Salpeter time. The binaries may also accrete a significant amount of gas from the disk, well above the Eddington rate. This could lead to detectable X-ray or gamma-ray emission, but would require hyper-Eddington accretion with a few percent radiative efficiency, comparable to thin disks. We discuss implications for gravitational wave observations and black hole population studies. We estimate that Advanced LIGO may detect $\sim20$ such, gas-induced binary mergers per year.},

@article{Wang2022,
abstract = {The disks of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) have emerged as rich environments for the production and capture of stars and the compact objects that they leave behind. These stars produce long Gamma-Ray Bursts (LGRBs) at their deaths, while frequent interactions among compact objects form binary neutron stars and neutron star-black hole binaries, leading to short GRBs (SGRBs) upon their merger. Predicting the properties of these transients as they emerge from the dense environments of AGN disks is key to their proper identification and to better constrain the star and compact object population in AGN disks. Some of these transients would appear unusual because they take place in much higher densities than the interstellar medium. Others, which are the subject of this paper, would additionally be modified by radiation diffusion, since they are generated within optically thick regions of the accretion disks. Here we compute the GRB afterglow light curves for diffused GRB sources for a representative variety of central black hole masses and disk locations. We find that the radiation from radio to UV and soft X-rays can be strongly suppressed by synchrotron self-absorption in the dense medium of the AGN disk. In addition, photon diffusion can significantly delay the emergence of the emission peak, turning a beamed, fast transient into a slow, isotropic, and dimmer one. These would appear as broadband-correlated AGN variability with a dominance at the higher frequencies. Their properties can constrain both the stellar populations within AGN disks as well as the disk structure.},

@article{Coughlin2017,
abstract = {We investigate the pre-disruption gravitational dynamics and post-disruption hydrodynamics of the tidal disruption of stars by supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries. We focus on binaries with relatively low mass primaries (106M⊙), moderate mass ratios, and separations with reasonably long gravitational wave inspiral times (tens of Myr). First, we generate a large ensemble (between 1 and 10 million) of restricted three-body integrations to quantify the statistical properties of tidal disruptions by circular SMBH binaries of initially unbound stars. Compared to the reference case of a disruption by a single SMBH, the binary potential induces a significant variance into the specific energy and angular momentum of the star at the point of disruption. Second, we use Newtonian numerical hydrodynamics to study the detailed evolution of the fallback debris from 120 disruptions randomly selected from the three-body ensemble (excluding only the most deeply penetrating encounters). We find that the overall morphology of the debris is greatly altered by the presence of the second black hole, and the accretion rate histories display a wide range of behaviours, including order of magnitude dips and excesses relative to control simulations that include only one black hole. Complex evolution typically persists for many orbital periods of the binary. We find evidence for power in the accretion curves on time-scales related to the binary orbital period, though there is no exact periodicity. We discuss our results in the context of future wide-field surveys, and comment on the prospects of identifying and characterizing the subset of events occurring in nuclei with binary SMBHs.},

abstract = {A near-equal-mass binary black hole (BH) can clear a central cavity in a circumbinary accretion disc; however, previousworks have revealed accretion streams entering this cavity.Herewe use 2D hydrodynamical simulations to study the accretion streams and their periodic behaviour. In particular, we perform a suite of simulations, covering different binary mass ratios q =M2/M1 in the range 0.003 ≤ q ≤ 1. In each case, we follow the system for several thousand binary orbits, until it relaxes to a stable accretion pattern.We find the following results: (i) the binary is efficient in maintaining a low-density cavity. However, the time-averaged mass accretion rate into the cavity, through narrow coherent accretion streams, is suppressed by at most a factor of a few compared to a disc with a single BH with the same mass; (ii) for q > ̃ 0.05, the accretion rate is strongly modulated by the binary, and depending on the precise value of q, the power spectrum of the accretion rate shows either one, two or three distinct periods; and (iii) for q < ̃ 0.05, the accretion rate becomes steady, with no time variations. Most binaries produced in galactic mergers are expected to have q > ̃ 0.05. If the luminosity of these binaries tracks their accretion rate, then a periodogram of their light curve could help in their identification, and to constrain their mass ratio and disc properties. {\textcopyright}2013 The Authors.},

In many of these events, the white dwarf begins to lose mass during the main observational phase of the inspiral. The mass-loss starts gently and can last for thousands of orbits. The white dwarf matter overflows the Roche lobe through the L1 point at each pericentre passage and the mass-loss repeats periodically. The process occurs very close to the black hole and the released gas can accrete, creating a bright source of radiation with luminosity close to the Eddington limit, L $\sim$ 1043 ergs-1.

@article{Wevers2022,
abstract = {Stars that interact with supermassive black holes (SMBHs) can either be completely or partially destroyed by tides. In a partial tidal disruption event (TDE) the high-density core of the star remains intact, and the low-density, outer envelope of the star is stripped and feeds a luminous accretion episode. The TDE AT2018fyk, with an inferred black hole mass of $10^{7.7\pm0.4}$ M$_{\odot}$, experienced an extreme dimming event at X-ray (factor of $>$6000) and UV (factor $\sim$15) wavelengths $\sim$500--600 days after discovery. Here we report on the re-emergence of these emission components roughly 1200 days after discovery. We find that the source properties are similar to those of the pre-dimming accretion state, suggesting that the accretion flow was rejuvenated to a similar state. We propose that a repeating partial TDE, where the partially disrupted star is on a $\sim 1200$ day orbit about the SMBH and is periodically stripped of mass during each pericenter passage, powers its unique lightcurve. This scenario provides a plausible explanation for AT2018fyk's overall properties, including the rapid dimming event and the rebrightening at late times. We also provide testable predictions for the behavior of the accretion flow in the future: if the second encounter was also a partial disruption then we predict another strong dimming event around day 1800 (August 2023), and a subsequent rebrightening around day 2400 (March 2025). This source provides strong evidence of the partial disruption of a star by a SMBH.},

@article{Kroglu2022,
abstract = {We study close encounters of a $1\,M_{\odot}$ middle-age main-sequence star (modelled using MESA) with massive black holes through hydrodynamic simulations, and explore in particular the dependence of the outcomes on the black hole mass. We consider here black holes in the intermediate-mass range, $M_{\rm BH}= 100-10^4\,M_{\odot}$. Possible outcomes vary from a small tidal perturbation for weak encounters all the way to partial or full disruption for stronger encounters. We find that stronger encounters lead to increased mass loss at the first pericenter passage, in many cases ejecting the partially disrupted star on an unbound orbit. For encounters that initially produce a bound system, with only partial stripping of the star, the fraction of mass stripped from the star increases with each subsequent pericenter passage and a stellar remnant of finite mass is ultimately ejected in all cases. We also find that the number of successive close passages before ejection decreases as we go from the stellar-mass black hole to the intermediate-mass black hole regime. For instance, after an initial encounter right at the classical tidal disruption limit, a $1\,M_{\odot}$ star undergoes 16 (5) pericenter passages before ejection from a $10\,M_{\odot}$ ($100\,M_{\odot}$) black hole. Observations of consecutive electromagnetic flares from these repeated close passages could in principle be used to determine the mass of the black hole, thus possibly proving the existence of intermediate-mass black holes.},

@article{Lajoie2011,
abstract = {Despite numerous efforts to better understand binary star evolution, some aspects of it remain poorly constrained. In particular, the evolution of eccentric binaries has remained elusive mainly because the Roche lobe formalism derived for circular binaries does not apply. Here we report the results of our smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations of mass transfer in eccentric binaries using an alternate method in which we model only the outermost layers of the stars with appropriate boundary conditions. Using this technique, along with properly relaxed model stars, we characterize the mass transfer episodes of binaries with various orbital parameters. In particular, we show that these episodes can be described by Gaussians with an FWHM of ∼0.12Porb and that the peak rates occur after periastron, at an orbital phase of ∼0.58, independently of the eccentricity and mass of the stars. The accreted material is observed to form a rather sparse envelope around either or both stars. Although the fate of this envelope is not modeled in our simulations, we show that a constant fraction (∼5\%) of the material transferred is ejected from the systems. We discuss this result in terms of the non-conservative mass transfer scenario. We suggest that our results could be incorporated in analytical and binary population synthesis studies to help better understand the evolution of eccentric binaries and the formation of exotic stellar populations. {\textcopyright} 2011 The American Astronomical Society.

@article{Chen2022,
abstract = {During the inspiralling of a white dwarf (WD) into an intermediate-mass black hole ($\sim$10^{2-5} M_sun), both gravitational waves (GWs) and electromagnetic (EM) radiation are emitted. Once the eccentric orbit's pericenter radius approaches the tidal radius, the WD would be tidally stripped upon each pericenter passage. The accretion of these stripped mass would produce EM radiation. It is suspected that the recently discovered new types of transients, namely the quasi-periodic eruptions and the fast ultraluminous X-ray bursts, might originate from such systems. Modeling these flares requires a prediction of the amount of stripped mass from the WD and the details of the mass supply to the accretion disk. We run hydrodynamical simulations to study the orbital parameter dependence of the stripped mass. We find that our results match the analytical estimate that the stripped mass is proportional to a 5/2-th power of the excess depth by which the WD overfills its instantaneous Roche lobe at the pericenter. The corresponding fallback rate of the stripped mass is calculated, which may be useful in interpreting the individual flaring light curve in candidate EM sources. We further calculate the long-term mass-loss evolution of a WD during its inspiral and the detectability of the GW and EM signals. The EM signal from the mass-loss stage can be easily detected: the limiting distance is $\sim$320(M_h/10^4 M_sun) Mpc for Einstein Probe. The GW signal, for the space-borne detectors such as Laser Interferometer Space Antenna or TianQin, can be detected only within the Local Supercluster ($\sim$33 Mpc).},

abstract = {We use long-run, high-resolution hydrodynamics simulations to compute the multi-wavelength light curves (LCs) from thermal disk emission around accreting equal-mass supermassive black hole (BH) binaries, with a focus on revealing binary eccentricity. LCs are obtained by modeling the disk thermodynamics with an adiabatic equation of state, a local blackbody cooling prescription, and corrections to approximate the effects of radiation pressure. We find that in general, the optical and infrared LCs are in-phase with one another (to within $\sim\,$2\% of an orbital period), but they contain pulse substructure in the time domain that is not necessarily reflected in BH accretion rates $\dot M$. We thus predict that multi-wavelength observing campaigns will reveal binary-hosting AGN to exhibit highly correlated, in-phase, periodic brightness modulations in their low-energy disk emission. If jet emission is predicted by $\dot{M}$, then we predict a weaker correlation with low-energy disk emission due to the differing sub-peak structure. We show that LC variability due to hydrodynamics likely dominates Doppler brightening for all equal-mass binaries with disk Mach numbers $\lesssim 20$. A promising signature of eccentricity is weak or absent "lump" periodicity. We find hints that $\dot{M}$ significantly lags the low-energy disk emission for circular binaries, but is in-phase for eccentric binaries, which might explain some "orphan" blazar flares with no $\gamma$-ray counterpart.},

abstract = {We carry out 2D viscous hydrodynamical simulations of circumbinary accretion using the AREPO code. We self-consistently compute the accretion flow over a wide range of spatial scales, from the circumbinary disk (CBD) far from the central binary, through accretion streamers, to the disks around individual binary components, resolving the flow down to 2\% of the binary separation. We focus on equal-mass binaries with arbitrary eccentricities. We evolve the flow over long (viscous) timescales until a quasi-steady is reached, in which the mass supply rate at large distances $\dot{M}_0$ (assumed constant) equals the time-averaged mass transfer rate across the disk and the total mass accretion rate onto the binary components. This quasi-steady state allows us to compute the secular angular momentum transfer rate onto the binary, $\langle\dot{J}_b\rangle$, and the resulting orbital evolution. Through direct computation of the gravitational and accretion torques on the binary, we find that $\langle\dot{J}_b\rangle$ is consistently positive (i.e., the binary gains angular momentum), with $l_0\equiv\langle\dot{J}_b\rangle/\dot M_0$ in the range of $(0.4-0.8)a_b^2\Omega_b$, depending on the binary eccentricity (where $a_b,\sim\Omega_b$ are the binary semi-major axis and angular frequency); we also find that this $\langle\dot{J}_b\rangle$ is equal to the net angular momentum current across the CBD, indicating that global angular momentum balance is achieved in our simulations. We compute the time-averaged rate of change of the binary orbital energy for eccentric binaries, and thus obtain the secular rates $\langle\dot a_b\rangle$ and $\langle \dot{e}_b\rangle$. In all cases, $\langle\dot{a}_b\rangle$ is positive, i.e., the binary expands while accreting. We discuss the implications of our results for the merger of supermassive binary black holes and for the formation of close stellar binaries.},

@article{DOrazio2021,
abstract = {We solve the equations of two-dimensional hydrodynamics describing a circumbinary disk accreting onto an eccentric, equal-mass binary. We compute the time rate of change of the binary semi-major axis $a$ and eccentricity $e$ over a continuous range of eccentricities spanning $e=0$ to $e=0.9$. We find that binaries with initial eccentricities $e_0\lesssim 0.1$ tend to $e=0$, where the binary semi-major axis expands. All others are attracted to $e \approx 0.4$, where the binary semi-major axis decays. The $e \approx 0.4$ attractor is caused by a rapid change in the disk response from an apsidally locked, nearly symmetric state to a precessing asymmetric state. The state change causes the time rates of change $\dot{a}$ and $\dot{e}$ to steeply change sign at the same critical eccentricity resulting in an attracting solution where $\dot{a} = \dot{e} = 0$. This does not, however, result in a stalled, eccentric binary. Due to a finite transition time between disk states, the binary eccentricity continually overshoots the attracting eccentricity resulting in a constant drift of the semi-major axis. For fiducial disk parameters, binaries with $e_0 \gtrsim 0.1$ evolve towards and then oscillate around $e \approx 0.4$ where they steadily shrink in semi-major axis. Because unequal mass binaries grow towards equal mass through preferential accretion, our results are applicable to a wide range of initial binary mass ratios. Hence, these findings merit further investigations of this disk transition; understanding its dependence on disk parameters is vital for determining the fate of binaries undergoing orbital evolution with a circumbinary disk.},

abstract = {We propose a scenario in which massive stars form at the outer edges of an AGN accretion disc. We analyze the dynamics of a disc forming around a supermassive black hole, in which the angular momentum is transported by turbulence induced by the disc's self-gravity. We find that once the surface density of the disc exceeds a critical value, the disc fragments into dense clumps. The biggest clumps collapse and form massive stars, which produce few-tens-solar-mass black holes at the end of their evolution. The embedded black holes will interact gravitationally with the massive accretion disc and be dragged towards the central black hole. Merger of a disc-born black hole with the central black hole will produce a burst of gravitational waves. If the central black hole is accreting at a rate comparable to the Eddington limit, the gas drag from the accretion disc will not alter significantly the dynamics of the final year of merger, and the gravitational waves should be observable by LISA. We argue that for a reasonable range of parameters such mergers will be detected monthly, and that the gravitational-wave signal from these mergers is distinct from that of other merger scenarios. Also, for some plausible black hole masses and accretion rates, the burst of gravitational waves should be accompanied by a detectable change in the optical luminosity of the central engine.},

abstract = {We propose that supermassive stars may form in quasar accretion disks, and we discuss possible observational consequences. The structure and stability of very massive stars are reviewed. Because of high accretion rates, quasar disks are massive and the fringes of their optically luminous parts are prone to fragmentation. Starting from a few hundred solar masses, a dominant fragment will grow to the isolation mass, which is a significant fraction of the disk mass, more quickly than the fragment contracts onto the stellar main sequence. A gap will form in the disk and the star will migrate inward on the accretion timescale, which is comparable to the star's main sequence lifetime. By interrupting the gas supply to the inner disk, the gap may temporarily dim and redden the quasar. The final stages of stellar migration will be a strong source of low-frequency gravitational waves.},

abstract = { Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can funnel stars and stellar remnants from the vicinity of the galactic center into the inner plane of the AGN disk. Stars reaching this inner region can be tidally disrupted by the stellar-mass black holes in the disk. Such micro tidal disruption events (micro-TDEs) could be a useful probe of stellar interaction with the AGN disk. We find that micro-TDEs in AGNs occur at a rate of ∼170 Gpc −3 yr −1 . Their cleanest observational probe may be the electromagnetic detection of tidal disruption in AGNs by heavy supermassive black holes ( M • ≳ 10 8 M ⊙ ) that cannot tidally disrupt solar-type stars. The reconstructed rate of such events from observations, nonetheless, appears to be much lower than our estimated micro-TDE rate. We discuss two such micro-TDE candidates observed to date (ASASSN-15lh and ZTF19aailpwl). },

@article{Tagawa2022,
abstract = { Stellar-mass BHs (sBHs) are predicted to be embedded in active galactic nucleus (AGN) disks owing to gravitational drag and in situ star formation. However, we find that, due to a high gas density in an AGN disk environment, compact objects may rapidly grow to intermediate-mass BHs and deplete matter from the AGN disk unless accretion is suppressed by some feedback process(es). These consequences are inconsistent with AGN observations and the dynamics of the Galactic center. Here we consider mechanical feedback mechanisms for the reduction of gas accretion. Rapidly accreting sBHs launch winds and/or jets via the Blandford–Znajek mechanism, which produce high-pressure shocks and cocoons. Such a shock and cocoon can spread laterally in the plane of the disk, eject the outer regions of a circum-sBH disk (CsBD), and puncture a hole in the AGN disk with horizontal size comparable to the disk scale height. Since the depletion timescale of the bound CsBD is much shorter than the resupply timescale of gas to the sBH, the time-averaged accretion rate onto sBHs is reduced by this process by a factor of ∼10–100. This feedback mechanism can therefore help alleviate the sBH overgrowth and AGN disk depletion problems. On the other hand, we find that cocoons of jets can unbind a large fraction of the gas accreting in the disks of less massive supermassive BHs (SMBHs), which may help explain the dearth of high-Eddington-ratio AGNs with SMBH mass ≲ 10 5 M ⊙ . },

abstract = {We propose a novel scenario for possible electromagnetic (EM) emission by compact binary mergers in the accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Nuclear star clusters in AGNs are a plausible formation site of compact-stellar binaries (CSBs) whose coalescences can be detected through gravitational waves (GWs). We investigate the accretion onto and outflows from CSBs embedded in AGN disks. We show that these outflows are likely to create outflow "cavities" in the AGN disks before the binaries merge, which makes EM or neutrino counterparts much less common than would otherwise be expected. We discuss the necessary conditions for detectable EM counterparts to mergers inside the outflow cavities. If the merger remnant black hole experiences a high recoil velocity and can enter the AGN disk, it can accrete gas with a super-Eddington rate, newly forming a cavity-like structure. This bubble can break out of the disk within a day to a week after the merger. Such breakout emission can be bright enough to be detectable by current soft X-ray instruments, such as {\it Swift}-XRT and {\it Chandra}.},

abstract = {Eccentricity of wide binaries is difficult to measure due to their long orbital periods. With Gaia's high-precision astrometric measurements, eccentricity of a wide binary can be constrained by the angle between the separation vector and the relative velocity vector (the v-r angle). In this paper, by using the v-r angles of wide binaries in Gaia Early Data Release 3, we develop a Bayesian approach to measure the eccentricity distribution as a function of binary separations. Furthermore, we infer the eccentricities of individual wide binaries and make them publicly available. Our results show that the eccentricity distribution of wide binaries at 102 AU is close to uniform and becomes superthermal at >103 AU, suggesting two formation mechanisms dominating at different separation regimes. The close binary formation, most likely disc fragmentation, results in a uniform eccentricity distribution at <102 AU. The wide binary formation that leads to highly eccentric wide binaries at >103 AU may be turbulent fragmentation and/or the dynamical unfolding of compact triples. With Gaia, measuring eccentricities is now possible for a large number of wide binaries, opening a new window to understanding binary formation and evolution.},

abstract = {We present a new homogeneous sample of 32 spectroscopic binary orbits in the young 150 Myr) main-sequence open cluster M35. The distribution of orbital eccentricity vs. orbital period (e-log(P)) displays a distinct transition from eccentric to circular orbits at an orbital period of $\sim$ 10 days. The transition is due to tidal circularization of the closest binaries. The population of binary orbits in M35 provide a significantly improved constraint on the rate of tidal circularization at an age of 150 Myr. We propose a new and more robust diagnostic of the degree of tidal circularization in a binary population based on a functional fit to the e-log(P) distribution. We call this new measure the tidal circularization period. The tidal circularization period of a binary population represents the orbital period at which a binary orbit with the most frequent initial orbital eccentricity circularizes (defined as e = 0.01) at the age of the population. We determine the tidal circularizationperiod for M35 as well as for 7 additional binary populations spanning ages from the pre main-sequence 3 Myr) to late main-sequence 10 Gyr), and use Monte Carlo error analysis to determine the uncertainties on the derived circularization periods. We conclude that current theories of tidal circularization cannot account for the distribution of tidal circularization periods with population age.},

Detection of their absorption lines have become possible with the high spatial and spectral resolution and sensitivity of the adaptive optics integral Held spectrometer SPIFFI/SINFONI on the ESO VLT. Several of these OB stars appear to be helium and nitrogen rich. Almost all of the 80 massive stars now known in the central parsec (central arcsecond excluded) reside in one of two somewhat thick (/R 0.14) rotating disks. These stellar disks have fairly sharp inner edges (R 1′′) and surface density profiles that scale as R-2. We do not detect any OB stars outside the central 0.5 pc.

abstract = {Hundreds of stellar-mass black holes probably form in a typical globular star cluster, with all but one predicted to be ejected through dynamical interactions. Some observational support for this idea is provided by the lack of X-ray-emitting binary stars comprising one black hole and one other star ('black-hole/X-ray binaries') in Milky Way globular clusters, even though many neutron-star/X-ray binaries are known. Although a few black holes have been seen in globular clusters around other galaxies, the masses of these cannot be determined, and some may be intermediate-mass black holes that form through exotic mechanisms. Here we report the presence of two flat-spectrum radio sources in the Milky Way globular cluster M22, and we argue that these objects are black holes of stellar mass (each ∼10-20 times more massive than the Sun) that are accreting matter. We find a high ratio of radio-to-X-ray flux for these black holes, consistent with the larger predicted masses of black holes in globular clusters compared to those outside. The identification of two black holes in one cluster shows that ejection of black holes is not as efficient as predicted by most models, and we argue that M22 may contain a total population of ∼5-100 black holes. The large core radius of M22 could arise from heating produced by the black holes. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

We find that stellar-mass black holes, formed in the supernova explosions of the most massive cluster stars, can constitute a dynamically important population. If a significant ensemble is retained (here we assume complete retention), these objects rapidly form a dense core where interactions are common, resulting in the scattering of black holes into the cluster halo, and the ejection of black holes from the cluster. These two processes heat the stellar component, resulting in prolonged core expansion of a magnitude matching the observations. Significant core evolution is also observed in Magellanic Cloud clusters at early times. We find that this does not result from the action of black holes, but can be reproduced by the effects of mass-loss due to rapid stellar evolution in a primordially mass-segregated cluster. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Authors.

But to fully utilize this new window into the Universe, we must compare these new observations to detailed models of binary black hole formation throughout cosmic time. Expanding upon our previous work [C. L. Rodriguez, M. Morscher, B. Pattabiraman, S. Chatterjee, C.-J. Haster, and F. A. Rasio, Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 051101 (2015).], we study merging binary black holes formed in globular clusters using our Monte Carlo approach to stellar dynamics. We have created a new set of 52 cluster models with different masses, metallicities, and radii to fully characterize the binary black hole merger rate. These models include all the relevant dynamical processes (such as two-body relaxation, strong encounters, and three-body binary formation) and agree well with detailed direct N-body simulations. In addition, we have enhanced our stellar evolution algorithms with updated metallicity-dependent stellar wind and supernova prescriptions, allowing us to compare our results directly to the most recent population synthesis predictions for merger rates from isolated binary evolution. We explore the relationship between a cluster's global properties and the population of binary black holes that it produces. In particular, we derive a numerically calibrated relationship between the merger times of ejected black hole binaries and a cluster's mass and radius. With our improved treatment of stellar evolution, we find that globular clusters can produce a significant population of massive black hole binaries that merge in the local Universe. We explore the masses and mass ratios of these binaries as a function of redshift, and find a merger rate of ∼5 Gpc-3yr-1 in the local Universe, with 80\% of sources having total masses from 32M⊙ to 64M⊙. Under standard assumptions, approximately one out of every seven binary black hole mergers in the local Universe will have originated in a globular cluster, but we also explore the sensitivity of this result to different assumptions for binary stellar evolution. If black holes were born with significant natal kicks, comparable to those of neutron stars, then the merger rate of binary black holes from globular clusters would be comparable to that from the field, with approximately 1/2 of mergers originating in clusters. Finally we point out that population synthesis results for the field may also be modified by dynamical interactions of binaries taking place in dense star clusters which, unlike globular clusters, dissolved before the present day.},

abstract = {We explore the formation of mass-transferring binary systems containing black holes within globular clusters. We show that it is possible to form mass-transferring black hole binaries with main sequence, giant, and white dwarf companions with a variety of orbital parameters in globular clusters spanning a large range in present-day properties. All mass-transferring black hole binaries found in our models at late times are dynamically created. The black holes in these systems experienced a median of $\sim 30$ dynamical encounters within the cluster before and after acquiring the donor. Furthermore, we show that the presence of mass-transferring black hole systems has little correlation with the total number of black holes within the cluster at any time. This is because the net rate of formation of black hole-non-black hole binaries in a cluster is largely independent of the total number of retained black holes. Our results suggest that the detection of a mass-transferring black hole binary in a globular cluster does not necessarily indicate that the host cluster contains a large black hole population.},

@article{Li2021,
abstract = {We perform a series of high-resolution 2D hydrodynamical simulations of equal-mass binary black holes (BBHs) embedded in active galactic nucleus (AGN) accretion disks to study whether these binaries can be driven to merger by the surrounding gas. We find that the gravitational softening adopted for the BBH has a profound impact on this result. When the softening is less than 10\% of the binary separation, we show that, in agreement with recent simulations of isolated equal-mass binaries, prograde BBHs expand in time rather than contract. Eventually, however, the binary separation becomes large enough that the tidal force of the central AGN disrupts them. Only when the softening is relatively large do we find that prograde BBHs harden. We determine through detailed analysis of the binary torque, that this dichotomy is due to a loss of spiral structure in the circum-single disks orbiting each black hole when the softening is a significant fraction of the binary separation. Properly resolving these spirals—both with high resolution and small softening—results in a significant source of binary angular momentum. Only for retrograde BBHs do we find consistent hardening, regardless of softening, as these BBHs lack the important spiral structure in their circum-single disks. This suggests that the gas-driven inspiral of retrograde binaries can produce a population of compact BBHs in the gravitational-wave-emitting regime in AGN disks, which may contribute a large fraction to the observed BBH mergers.},

@article{Li2022,
abstract = {Stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs) embedded in active galactic nucleus (AGN) discs are possible progenitors of black hole mergers detected in gravitational waves by LIGO/VIRGO. To better understand the hydrodynamical evolution of BBHs interacting with the disc gas, we perform a suite of high-resolution 2D simulations of binaries in local disc (shearing-box) models, considering various binary mass ratios, eccentricities and background disc properties. We use the $\gamma$ -law equation of state and adopt a robust post-processing treatment to evaluate the mass accretion rate, torque and energy transfer rate on the binary to determine its long-term orbital evolution. We find that circular comparable-mass binaries contract, with an orbital decay rate of a few times the mass doubling rate. Eccentric binaries always experience eccentricity damping. Prograde binaries with higher eccentricities or smaller mass ratios generally have slower orbital decay rates, with some extreme cases exhibiting orbital expansion. The averaged binary mass accretion rate depends on the physical size of the accretor. The accretion flows are highly variable, and the dominant variability frequency is the apparent binary orbital frequency (in the rotating frame around the central massive BH) for circular binaries but gradually shifts to the radial epicyclic frequency as the binary eccentricity increases. Our findings demonstrate that the dynamics of BBHs embedded in AGN discs is quite different from that of isolated binaries in their own circumbinary discs. Furthermore, our results suggest that the hardening time-scales of the binaries are much shorter than their migration time-scales in the disc, for all reasonable binary and disc parameters.},

@article{Kaaz2021,
abstract = {Stellar-mass black holes can become embedded within the gaseous disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Afterwards, their interactions are mediated by their gaseous surroundings. In this work, we study the evolution of stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs) embedded within AGN disks using a combination of three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations and analytic methods, focusing on environments in which the AGN disk scale height $H$ is $\gtrsim$ the BBH sphere of influence. We model the local surroundings of the embedded BBHs using a wind tunnel formalism and characterize different accretion regimes based on the local properties of the disk, which range from wind-dominated to quasi-spherical. We use our simulations to develop prescriptions for mass accretion and drag for embedded BBHs. We use these prescriptions, along with AGN disk models that can represent the Toomre-unstable outer regions of AGN disks, to study the long-term evolution of the BBHs as they migrate through the disk. We find that BBHs typically merge within $\lesssim 5-30\,{\rm Myr}$, increasing their mass significantly in the process, allowing BBHs to enter (or cross) the pair-instability supernova mass gap. The rate at which gas is supplied to these BBHs often exceeds the Eddington limit, sometimes by several orders of magnitude. We conclude that most embedded BBHs will merge before migrating significantly in the disk. Depending on the conditions of the ambient gas and the distance to the system, LISA can detect the transition between the gas-dominated and gravitational wave dominated regime for inspiraling BBHs that are formed sufficiently close to the AGN ($\lesssim$ 0.1 pc). We also discuss possible electromagnetic signatures during and following the inspiral, finding that it is generally unlikely but not inconceivable for the bolometric luminosity of the BBH to exceed that of the host AGN.},

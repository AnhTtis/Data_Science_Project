abstract = {Chiral discrimination, a problem of vital importance, has recently become an emerging frontier in ultrafast physics, with remarkable progress achieved in multiphoton and strong-field regimes. Rydberg excitations, unavoidable in the strong-field regime and intentional for few-photon processes, arise in all these approaches. Here, we show how to harness this ubiquitous feature by introducing a new phenomenon, enantiosensitive free-induction decay, steered by a tricolor chiral field at a gentle intensity, structured in space and time. We demonstrate theoretically that an excited chiral molecule accumulates an enantiosensitive phase due to perturbative interactions with the tricolor chiral field, resulting in a spatial phase gradient steering the free-induction decay in opposite directions for opposite enantiomers. Our work introduces a general, extremely sensitive, all-optical enantiosensitive detection technique that avoids strong fields and takes full advantage of recent advances in structuring light. Detection of molecular chirality using only the electric field of light becomes possible via a nonlinear Stark shift.}}

abstract = {The question of how the orbital angular momentum of structured light might engage with chiral matter is a topic of resurgent interest. By taking account of electric quadrupole transition moments, it is shown that the handedness of the beam can indeed be exhibited in local chiral effects, being dependent on the sign of the topological charge. In the specific case of absorption, a significant interplay of wavefront structure and polarization is resolved, and clear differences in behavior are identified for systems possessing a degree of orientational order and for those that are randomly oriented.},

The method is based on a large expansion on the origin, supplemented by a limited number of off-center functions located on the positions of the nuclei. The method has been applied to study the photoionization of Cl2, of the model system (CO)2 and of Cr(CO)6. The method has proven very efficient: the convergence to the exact results is obtained with matrices which are much smaller than those involved in one center expansion calculations and the algorithm is numerically stable up to very high photoelectron energies (200 eV). The importance of the asymptotic moment basis set requirement is pointed out and rationalized with the help of a simple model. Preliminary calculations on Cr(CO)6 are then presented and their convergence discussed.}

The unique advantage of this non-resonant, nonlinear technique is that the chiral signal can be scaled and tuned. In this paper, we extend this technique to enantiopure powders of alanine and camphor by dissolving them in solvents of varying concentrations. We show the differential absorbance of helical light to be an order of magnitude higher relative to conventional resonant linear techniques and is comparable to nonlinear techniques that use circularly polarized light. The origin of helicity dependent absorption is discussed in terms of induced multipole moments in nonlinear light–matter interaction. These results opens up new opportunities in using helical light as a primary chiral reagent in nonlinear spectroscopic techniques.}",

abstract = {This tutorial provides an overview of the local description of polarization for nonparaxial light, for which all Cartesian components of the electric field are significant. The polarization of light at each point is characterized by a three-component complex vector in the case of full polarization and by a 3 {\texttimes} 3 polarization matrix for partial polarization. Standard concepts for paraxial polarization such as the degree of polarization, the Stokes parameters, and the Poincar\'{e} sphere then have generalizations for nonparaxial light that are not unique and/or not trivial. This work aims to clarify some of these discrepancies, present some new concepts, and provide a framework that highlights the similarities and differences with the description for the paraxial regimes. Particular emphasis is placed on geometric interpretations.},

abstract = {We demonstrate a technique that uses high-order harmonic generation in molecules to probe nuclear dynamics and structural rearrangement on a subfemtosecond time scale. The chirped nature of the electron wavepacket produced by laser ionization in a strong field gives rise to a similar chirp in the photons emitted upon electron-ion recombination. Use of this chirp in the emitted light allows information about nuclear dynamics to be gained with 100-attosecond temporal resolution, from excitation by an 8-femtosecond pulse, in a single laser shot. Measurements on molecular hydrogen and deuterium agreed well with calculations of ultrafast nuclear dynamics in the H2+ molecule, confirming the validity of the method. We then measured harmonic spectra from CH4 and CD4 to demonstrate a few-femtosecond time scale for the onset of proton rearrangement in methane upon ionization.}}

  abstract = {We present YOLO, a new approach to object detection. Prior work on object
detection repurposes classifiers to perform detection. Instead, we frame object
detection as a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and
associated class probabilities. A single neural network predicts bounding boxes
and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. Since the
whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end
directly on detection performance.
  Our unified architecture is extremely fast. Our base YOLO model processes
images in real-time at 45 frames per second. A smaller version of the network,
Fast YOLO, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving
double the mAP of other real-time detectors. Compared to state-of-the-art
detection systems, YOLO makes more localization errors but is far less likely
to predict false detections where nothing exists. Finally, YOLO learns very
general representations of objects. It outperforms all other detection methods,
including DPM and R-CNN, by a wide margin when generalizing from natural images
to artwork on both the Picasso Dataset and the People-Art Dataset.},

abstract = {The state-of-the-art performance for object detection has been significantly improved
over the past two years. Besides the introduction of powerful deep neural networks,
such as GoogleNet and VGG, novel object detection frameworks, such as R-CNN and its
successors, Fast R-CNN, and Faster R-CNN, play an essential role in improving the
state of the art. Despite their effectiveness on still images, those frameworks are
not specifically designed for object detection from videos. Temporal and contextual
information of videos are not fully investigated and utilized. In this paper, we propose
a deep learning framework that incorporates temporal and contextual information from
tubelets obtained in videos, which dramatically improves the baseline performance
of existing still-image detection frameworks when they are applied to videos. It is
called T-CNN, i.e., tubelets with convolutional neueral networks. The proposed framework
won newly introduced an object-detection-from-video task with provided data in the
ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2015. Code is publicly available
at <uri>https://github.com/myfavouritekk/T-CNN</uri>.},

abstract = {We describe a method for predicting a classification of an object given classifications of the objects in the training set, assuming that the pairs object/classification are generated by an i.i.d. process from a continuous probability distribution. Our method is a modification of Vapnik's support-vector machine; its main novelty is that it gives not only the prediction itself but also a practicable measure of the evidence found in support of that prediction. We also describe a procedure for assigning degrees of confidence to predictions made by the support vector machine. Some experimental results are presented, and possible extensions of the algorithms are discussed.},

    "abstract": "Quantum memories capable of storing and retrieving coherent information for extended times at room temperature would enable a host of new technologies. Electron and nuclear spin qubits using shallow neutral donors in semiconductors have been studied extensively but are limited to low temperatures ($\\le$10 K); however, the nuclear spins of ionized donors have potential for high temperature operation. We use optical methods and dynamical decoupling to realize this potential for an ensemble of 31P donors in isotopically purified 28Si and observe a room temperature coherence time of over 39 minutes. We further show that a coherent spin superposition can be cycled from 4.2 K to room temperature and back, and report a cryogenic coherence time of 3 hours in the same system.",

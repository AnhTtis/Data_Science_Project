    "abstract": "In state estimation algorithms that use feature tracks as input, it is customary to assume that the errors in feature track positions are zero-mean Gaussian. Using a combination of calibrated camera intrinsics, ground-truth camera pose, and depth images, it is possible to compute ground-truth positions for feature tracks extracted using an image processing algorithm. We find that feature track errors are not zero-mean Gaussian and that the distribution of errors is conditional on the type of motion, the speed of motion, and the image processing algorithm used to extract the tracks.",

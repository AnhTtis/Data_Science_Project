    "abstract": "We survey the definition and some elementary properties of real trees. There\nare no new results, as far as we know. One purpose is to give a number of\ndifferent definitions and show the equivalence between them. We discuss also,\nfor example, the four-point inequality, the length measure and the connection\nto the theory of Gromov hyperbolic spaces. Several examples are given.",

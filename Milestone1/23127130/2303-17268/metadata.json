    "abstract": "Here we introduce the concept of classical input - quantum output (C-Q) non-signalling boxes, a generalisation of the classical input - classical output (C-C) non-signalling boxes. We argue that studying such objects leads to a better understanding of the relation between quantum nonlocality and non-locality beyond quantum mechanics. The main issue discussed in the paper is whether there exist 'genuine' C-Q boxes or all C-Q boxes can be built from objects already known, namely C-C boxes acting on pre-shared entangled quantum particles. We show that large classes of C-Q boxes are non-genuine. In particular, we show that all bi-partite C-Q boxes with outputs that are pure states are non-genuine. We also present various strategies for addressing the general problem, i.e. for multi-partite C-Q boxes which output mixed states, whose answer is still open. Finally, we show that even some very simple non-genuine C-Q boxes require large amounts of C-C nonlocal correlations in order to simulate them.",

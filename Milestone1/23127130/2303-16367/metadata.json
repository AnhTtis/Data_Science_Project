    "abstract": "In this paper, we study some optimization problems in uniformly convex and uniformly smooth Bochner spaces. We consider four cases of the underlying subsets: closed and convex subsets, closed and convex cones, closed subspaces and closed balls. In each case, we study the existence problems and the inverse image properties. We think that the results and the analytic methods in this paper could be applied to the theories of stochastic optimization, stochastic variational inequality and stochastic fixed point.",

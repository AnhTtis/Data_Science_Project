    "abstract": "Strong decays of the charmonium-like state $Y(4320)$ have been studied in the framework of the covariant confined quark model. The resonance $Y$ has been interpreted as a four-quark state of the molecular type. We evaluate the hidden-charm decay width of $Y$ to a vector and a scalar, with the latter decaying subsequently to a pair of charged pseudoscalar states. The strong decay modes $Y \\!\\to\\! π^{+}π^{-}J/Ψ$ and $Y \\!\\to\\! K^{+}K^{-} J/Ψ$ have been studied by involving the scalar resonance state $f_0(980)$. We have calculated the fractal widths of the related strong decays and the branching ratio ${\\cal B}(Y \\!\\to\\! K^{+}K^{-} J/Ψ)$ / ${\\cal B}(Y \\!\\to\\! π^{+}π^{-}J/Ψ)$, recently determined by the BESIII collaboration. The estimated branching ratio and calculated fractal strong decay widths are in good agreement with the latest experimental data, favoring the molecular representation of the $Y(4320)$ state.",

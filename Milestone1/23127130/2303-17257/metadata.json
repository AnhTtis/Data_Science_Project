    "abstract": "We show how an effect algebra $\\mathcal{X}$ can be regarded as a category, where the morphisms $x \\rightarrow y$ are the elements $f$ such that $x \\leq f \\leq y$. This gives an embedding $\\mathbf{EA} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{Cat}$. The interval $[x,y]$ proves to be an effect algebra in its own right, so $\\mathcal{X}$ is an $\\mathbf{EA}$-enriched category. The construction can therefore be repeated, meaning that every effect algebra can be identified with a strict $ω$-category. We describe explicitly the strict $ω$-category structure for two classes of operators on a Hilbert space.",

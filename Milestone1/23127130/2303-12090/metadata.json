    "abstract": "In this paper, we have introduced new viable solutions of Einstein-Maxwell field equations by incorporating the features of anisotropic matter distribution in the realm of General theory of Relativity ($GR$). For this procurement, we have employed a Finch-Skea spacetime along with a generalized polytropic equation of state ($EoS$). We have constructed various models of generalized polytropes by assuming the different choices of the polytropic index i.e.,$η=\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{2}{3}, 1$ and $2$. The numerous physical characteristics of these considered models have been studied via graphical analysis, which obey all the essential conditions of the astrophysical compact objects. Furthermore, such outcomes of charged anisotropic compact star models can be regained to the various cases such as linear, quadratic and polytropic $EoS$.",

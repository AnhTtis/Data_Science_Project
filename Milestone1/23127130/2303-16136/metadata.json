    "abstract": "We analyze the quantum resource generation of capacitively-coupled multilevel transmon circuits surrounded by bosonic baths, within the Markovian limit. In practice, the superconducting circuit elements are usually part of a larger circuit, constructed with many other linear circuit elements, which along with their environment is assumed to be mimicked by the baths. We study the response to variation of the coupling strength of resource generation for thee system prepared in zero-resource initial states. We focus, in particular, on entanglement and quantum coherence as resources. We quantify the entanglement generation power of coupled transmon qutrits, taking into account the maximum entanglement the system can generate and the time-scale over which the system can sustain a significant entanglement. We identify the optimal initial separable states leading to maximum entanglement generating power.",

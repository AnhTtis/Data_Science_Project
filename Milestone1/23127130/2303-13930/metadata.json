    "abstract": "The Mean Field Variational Bayes (MFVB) method is one of the most computationally efficient techniques for Bayesian inference. However, its use has been restricted to models with conjugate priors or those that require analytical calculations. This paper proposes a novel particle-based MFVB approach that greatly expands the applicability of the MFVB method. We establish the theoretical basis of the new method by leveraging the connection between Wasserstein gradient flows and Langevin diffusion dynamics, and demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using Bayesian logistic regression, stochastic volatility, and deep neural networks.",

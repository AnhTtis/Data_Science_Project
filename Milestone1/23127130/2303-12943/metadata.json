    "abstract": "Intraclass correlation in bilateral data has been investigated in recent decades with various statistical methods. In practice, stratifying bilateral data by some control variables will provide more sophisticated statistical results to satisfy different research proposed in random clinical trials. In this article, we propose three test statistics (likelihood ratio test, score test, and Wald-type test statistics) to evaluate the homogeneity of proportion ratios for stratified bilateral correlated data under an equal correlation assumption. Monte Carlo simulations of Type I error and power are performed, and the score test yields a robust outcome based on empirical Type I error and power. Lastly, a real data example is conducted to illustrate the proposed three tests.",

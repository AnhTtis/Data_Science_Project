    "abstract": "It is shown that following experimentally viable expressions for quark mixing angles $θ_{12}$, $θ_{23}$, $θ_{13}$ and CP-violating phase $δ$: $\\sinθ_{12} = \\sqrt{m_{d} / |m_{s}|}$, $\\sinθ_{23} = 2 \\, |m_{s}| / m_{b}$, $\\sinθ_{13} \\approx 2 \\, m_{d} / m_{b}$, $\\tanδ= m_{b}^{2} \\, m_{c} / 6 \\, m_{t} \\, m_{s}^{2}$ may be derived as stable points of certain 4-th power in $V_{CKM}$ flavor-invariant potentials built with traces of 3x3 quark up and down mass matrices and the Jarlskog invarian.",

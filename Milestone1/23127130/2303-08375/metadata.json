    "abstract": "This paper presents a study of large linear systems resulting from the regular $B$-splines finite element discretization of the $\\bm{curl}-\\bm{curl}$ and $\\bm{grad}-div$ elliptic problems on unit square/cube domains. We consider systems subject to both homogeneous essential and natural boundary conditions. Our objective is to develop a preconditioning strategy that is optimal and robust, based on the Auxiliary Space Preconditioning method proposed by Hiptmair et al. \\cite{hiptmair2007nodal}. Our approach is demonstrated to be robust with respect to mesh size, and we also show how it can be combined with the Generalized Locally Toeplitz (GLT) sequences analysis presented in \\cite{mazza2019isogeometric} to derive an algorithm that is optimal and stable with respect to spline degree. Numerical tests are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

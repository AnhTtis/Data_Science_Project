    \caption[Outline of our framework]{
        Outline of our framework that exploits a hazard function, which draws on the idea of survival prediction, to predict the discontinuation of ad creatives.
        The input includes the four types of features: text, categorical, image, and numerical features.
        The output is the hazard probability, which includes whether the target ad creative has been discontinued in each time interval.

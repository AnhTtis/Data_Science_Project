    "abstract": "A novel space-time discretization for the (linear) scalar-valued dissipative wave equation is presented. It is a structured approach, namely, the discretization space is obtained tensorizing the Virtual Element (VE) discretization in space with the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method in time. As such, it combines the advantages of both the VE and the DG methods. The proposed scheme is implicit and it is proved to be unconditionally stable and accurate in space and time.",

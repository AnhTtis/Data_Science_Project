    "abstract": "In this talk, given at Corfu 2022 Workshop on the Standard Model and Beyond, I present work in collaboration with Junichiro Kawamura,Ref.~[arXiv:2212.00840]. The talk is also based on a number of papers on a Global $SU(5)$ F-theory GUT in collaboration with Herb Clemens. In the model $SU(5)$ is broken to the MSSM via a Wilson line. This is accomplished (without problems with vector-like exotics) by simultaneously describing the F-theory model and its Heterotic dual. The model has a twin MSSM sector and it's the neutrino sector of the field I consider in the talk.",

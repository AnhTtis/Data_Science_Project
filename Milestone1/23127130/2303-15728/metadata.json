    "abstract": "Universal Lesion Detection (ULD) in computed tomography (CT) plays an essential role in computer-aided diagnosis. Promising ULD results have been reported by anchor-based detection designs, but they have inherent drawbacks due to the use of anchors: i) Insufficient training targets and ii) Difficulties in anchor design. Diffusion probability models (DPM) have demonstrated outstanding capabilities in many vision tasks. Many DPM-based approaches achieve great success in natural image object detection without using anchors. But they are still ineffective for ULD due to the insufficient training targets. In this paper, we propose a novel ULD method, DiffULD, which utilizes DPM for lesion detection. To tackle the negative effect triggered by insufficient targets, we introduce a novel center-aligned bounding box padding strategy that provides additional high-quality training targets yet avoids significant performance deterioration. DiffULD is inherently advanced in locating lesions with diverse sizes and shapes since it can predict with arbitrary boxes. Experiments on the benchmark dataset DeepLesion show the superiority of DiffULD when compared to state-of-the-art ULD approaches.",

    "abstract": "Consider a compact surface $\\mathscr{R}$ with distinguished points $z_1,\\ldots,z_n$ and conformal maps $f_k$ from the unit disk into non-overlapping quasidisks on $\\mathscr{R}$ taking $0$ to $z_k$. Let $Σ$ be the Riemann surface obtained by removing the closures of the images of $f_k$ from $\\mathscr{R}$.\n  We define forms which are meromorphic on $\\mathscr{R}$ with poles only at $z_1,\\ldots,z_n$, which we call Faber-Tietz forms. These are analogous to Faber polynomials in the sphere. We show that any $L^2$ holomorphic one-form on $Σ$ is uniquely expressible as a series of Faber-Tietz forms. This series converges both in $L^2(Σ)$ and uniformly on compact subsets of $Σ$.",

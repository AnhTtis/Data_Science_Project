    "abstract": "The paper deals with the problem of approximating the functions of several variables by branched continued fractions, in particular, multidimensional A- and J-fractions with independent variables. A generalization of Gragg's algorithm is constructed that enables us to compute, by the coefficients of the given formal multiple power series, the coefficients of the corresponding multidimensional A-fraction with independent variables. This algorithm can also be used to construct the multidimensional J-fraction with independent variables corresponding to a given formal multiple Laurent series. Some numerical experiments of approximating the functions of several variables by these branched continued fractions are given.",

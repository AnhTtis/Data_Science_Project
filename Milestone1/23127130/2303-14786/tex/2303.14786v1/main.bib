    abstract = "{We characterize the population of wandering black holes, defined as those physically offset from their halo centres, in the romulus cosmological simulations. Unlike most other currently available cosmological simulations, black holes are seeded based on local gas properties and are permitted to evolve dynamically without being fixed at halo centres. Tracking these black holes allows us to make robust predictions about the offset population. We find that the number of wandering black holes scales roughly linearly with the halo mass, such that we expect thousands of wandering black holes in galaxy cluster haloes. Locally, these wanderers account for around 10 per cent of the local black hole mass budget once seed masses are accounted for. Yet for higher redshifts (\\$z\\$ ≳ 4), wandering black holes both outweigh and outshine their central supermassive counterparts. Most wandering black holes, we find, remain close to the seed mass and originate from the centres of previously disrupted satellite galaxies. While most do not retain a resolved stellar counterpart, those that do are situated farther out at larger fractions of the virial radius. Wanderers with higher luminosities are preferentially at lower radius, more massive, and either closer to their host’s mid-planes or associated with a stellar overdensity. This analysis shows that our current census of supermassive black holes is incomplete and that a substantial population of off-centre wanderers likely exists.}",

    abstract = "{This study explores the gravitational lensing effects of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in galaxy clusters. While the presence of central SMBHs in galaxies is firmly established, recent work from high-resolution simulations predict the existence of an additional population of wandering SMBHs. Though the masses of these SMBHs are a minor perturbation on the larger scale and individual galaxy scale dark matter components in the cluster, they can impact statistical lensing properties and individual lensed image configurations. Probing for these potentially observable signatures, we find that SMBHs imprint detectable signatures in rare, higher order strong lensing image configurations although they do not manifest any statistically significant detectable evidence in either the magnification distribution or the integrated shear profile. Investigating specific lensed image geometries, we report that a massive, near point-like, potential of an SMBH causes the following detectable effects: (i) image splitting leading to the generation of extra images; (ii) positional and magnification asymmetries in multiply imaged systems; and (iii) the apparent disappearance of a lensed counter image. Of these, image splitting inside the cluster tangential critical curve, is the most prevalent notable observational signature. We demonstrate these possibilities in two cases of observed giant arcs in SGAS J003341.5+024217 and RX J1347.5−1145, wherein specific image configurations seen can be reproduced with SMBHs. Future observations with high-resolution instrumentation (e.g. MAVIS-Very Large Telescope, MICADO-Extremely Large Telescope, and the upgraded ngVLA, along with data from the Euclid and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescopes and the Rubin LSST Observatory are likely to allow us to probe these unique yet rare SMBHs lensing signatures.}",

It will become increasingly important for future surveys to distinguish between line-of-sight haloes and subhalos to avoid wrong inferences on the nature of dark matter. We reanalyse a subgalactic structure (in lens JVAS B1938 + 666) that has been previously found using the gravitational imaging technique in galaxy-galaxy lensing systems. This structure has been assumed to be a satellite in the halo of the main lens galaxy. We fit the redshift of the perturber of the system as a free parameter, using the multiplane thin-lens approximation, and find that the redshift of the perturber is \\$z\_\\mathrm\\{int\\} = 1.42^\\{+0.10\\}\_\\{-0.15\\}\\$ (with a main lens redshift of z = 0.881). Our analysis indicates that this structure is more massive than the previous result by an order of magnitude. This constitutes the first dark perturber shown to be a line-of-sight halo with a gravitational lensing method.}",

    abstract = "{Many dark matter (DM) models that are consistent with current cosmological data show differences in the predicted (sub)halo mass function, especially at sub-galactic scales, where observations are challenging due to the inefficiency of star formation. Strong gravitational lensing has been shown to be a useful tool for detecting dark low-mass (sub)haloes through perturbations in lensing arcs, therefore allowing the testing of different DM scenarios. However, measuring the total mass of a perturber from strong lensing data is challenging. Overestimating or underestimating perturber masses can lead to incorrect inferences about the nature of DM. In this paper, we argue that inferring an effective slope of the DM density profile, which is the power-law slope of perturbers at intermediate radii, where we expect the perturber to have the largest observable effect, is a promising way to circumvent these challenges. Using N-body simulations, we show that (sub)halo populations under different DM scenarios differ in their effective density slope distributions. Using realistic mocks of Hubble Space Telescope observations of strong lensing images, we show that the effective density slope of perturbers can be robustly measured with high enough accuracy to discern between different models. We also present our measurement of the effective density slope \\$\\gamma =1.96\\substack\\{+0.12 \\\\
-0.12\\}\\$ for the perturber in JVAS B1938+666, which is a 2σ outlier of the cold DM scenario. More measurements of this kind are needed to draw robust conclusions about the nature of DM.}",

These models are the first results from the Strong lensing at High Angular Resolution Program (SHARP), a project designed to study known quadruple image and Einstein ring lenses using high-resolution imaging, in order to probe their mass distributions in unprecedented detail. Here, we specifically highlight differences between AO- and HST-derived lens models, finding that – at least when the lens and source galaxies are both bright and red, and the system has a high degree of circular symmetry – AO-derived models place significantly tighter constraints on model parameters. Using this improved precision, we infer important physical properties about the B1938+666 system, including the mass density slope of the lensing galaxy (γ = 2.045), the projected dark matter mass fraction within the Einstein radius (Mdark/Mlens = 0.55) and the total magnification factor of the source galaxy (∼13). Additionally, we measure an upper-limit constraint on luminous substructure (MV \\&gt; 16.2), based on the non-detection of bright satellite galaxies in all data sets. Finally, we utilize the improved image resolution of the AO data to reveal the presence of faint arcs outside of the primary Einstein ring. The positions and orientations of these arcs raise the intriguing possibility that B1938+666 has a second source galaxy, located at a more distant redshift. However, future work is needed to verify this hypothesis.}",

    abstract = "{We measure and analyse the clustering of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) relative to the line of sight (LOS), for LOWZ and CMASS galaxy samples drawn from the final Data Release 12. The LOWZ sample contains 361 762 galaxies with an effective redshift of zlowz = 0.32, and the CMASS sample 777 202 galaxies with an effective redshift of zcmass = 0.57. From the power spectrum monopole and quadrupole moments around the LOS, we measure the growth of structure parameter f times the amplitude of dark matter density fluctuations σ8 by modelling the redshift-space distortion signal. When the geometrical Alcock–Paczynski effect is also constrained from the same data, we find joint constraints on fσ8, the product of the Hubble constant and the comoving sound horizon at the baryon-drag epoch H(z)rs(zd), and the angular distance parameter divided by the sound horizon DA(z)/rs(zd). We find f(zlowz)σ8(zlowz) = 0.394 ± 0.062, DA(zlowz)/rs(zd) = 6.35 ± 0.19, H(zlowz)rs(zd) = (11.41 ± 0.56) 103 km s− 1 for the LOWZ sample, and f(zcmass)σ8(zcmass) = 0.444 ± 0.038, DA(zcmass)/rs(zd) = 9.42 ± 0.15, H(zcmass)rs(zd) = (13.92 ± 0.44) 103 km s− 1 for the CMASS sample. We find general agreement with previous BOSS DR11 measurements. Assuming the Hubble parameter and angular distance parameter are fixed at fiducial Λcold dark matter values, we find f(zlowz)σ8(zlowz) = 0.485 ± 0.044 and f(zcmass)σ8(zcmass) = 0.436 ± 0.022 for the LOWZ and CMASS samples, respectively.}",

    abstract = "{We use the Millennium Simulation series to investigate the mass and redshift dependence of the concentration of equilibrium cold dark matter (CDM) haloes. We extend earlier work on the relation between halo mass profiles and assembly histories to show how the latter may be used to predict concentrations for haloes of all masses and at any redshift. Our results clarify the link between concentration and the ‘collapse redshift’ of a halo as well as why concentration depends on mass and redshift solely through the dimensionless ‘peak height’ mass parameter, ν(M, z) = δcrit(z)/σ(M, z). We combine these results with analytic mass accretion histories to extrapolate the c(M, z) relations to mass regimes difficult to reach through direct simulation. Our model predicts that, at given z, c(M) should deviate systematically from a simple power law at high masses, where concentrations approach a constant value, and at low masses, where concentrations are substantially lower than expected from extrapolating published empirical fits. This correction may reduce the expected self-annihilation boost factor from substructure by about one order of magnitude. The model also reproduces the c(M, z) dependence on cosmological parameters reported in earlier work and thus provides a simple and robust account of the relation between cosmology and the mass–concentration–redshift relation of CDM haloes.}",

    abstract = "{We use mock interferometric H‚Äâi measurements and a conventional tilted-ring modelling procedure to estimate circular velocity curves of dwarf galaxy discs from the APOSTLE suite of Œõ cold dark matter cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. The modelling yields a large diversity of rotation curves for an individual galaxy at fixed inclination, depending on the line-of-sight orientation. The diversity is driven by non-circular motions in the gas; in particular, by strong bisymmetric fluctuations in the azimuthal velocities that the tilted-ring model is ill-suited to account for and that are difficult to detect in model residuals. Large misestimates of the circular velocity arise when the kinematic major axis coincides with the extrema of the fluctuation pattern, in some cases mimicking the presence of kiloparsec-scale density ‚Äòcores‚Äô, when none are actually present. The thickness of APOSTLE discs compounds this effect: more slowly rotating extra-planar gas systematically reduces the average line-of-sight speeds. The recovered rotation curves thus tend to underestimate the true circular velocity of APOSTLE galaxies in the inner regions. Non-circular motions provide an appealing explanation for the large apparent cores observed in galaxies such as DDO¬†47 and DDO¬†87, where the model residuals suggest that such motions might have affected estimates of the inner circular velocities. Although residuals from tilted-ring models in the simulations appear larger than in observed galaxies, our results suggest that non-circular motions should be carefully taken into account when considering the evidence for dark matter cores in individual galaxies.}",

Through N-body simulations and analytic calculations we investigate the extent to which these properties can be generated from ‚Äòtypical‚ÄôŒõCDM galaxies, which differ in all of these properties, by the dynamical consequences of feedback.We find that, for a wide range of initial conditions, one impulsive mass-loss event will naturally produce a surface brightness profile in the remaining stellar component of a dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph) which is well-fitted over many scalelengths by an exponential, in good qualitative agreement with observations of Local Group dSphs. Furthermore, two impulsive mass-loss phases, punctuated by significant gas re-accretion, are found to be sufficient to transform a central density cusp in the dark matter profile into a near-constant density core. This may then provide the missing link between current cosmological simulations, which predict a central cusp in the dark matter density profile, and current observations, which find much shallower central density profiles.We also look at the angular momentum history of dSphs and demonstrate that if these galaxies have spent most of their lifetime in tidal isolation from massive galaxies then they cannot have formed from high angular momentum gas discs.}",

    abstract = "{We study the shape and kinematics of simulated dwarf galaxy discs in the apostle suite of Œõ cold dark matter (ŒõCDM) cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We find that a large fraction of these gas-rich, star-forming discs show weak bars in their stellar component, despite being dark-matter-dominated systems. The bar pattern shape and orientation reflect the ellipticity of the dark matter potential, and its rotation is locked to the slow figure rotation of the triaxial dark halo. The bar-like nature of the potential induces non-circular motions in the gas component, including strong bisymmetric flows that can be readily seen as m¬†=¬†3 harmonic perturbations in the H‚Äâi line-of-sight velocity fields. Similar bisymmetric flows are seen in many galaxies of
The HI Nearby Galaxy Survey (THINGS) and Local Irregulars That Trace Luminosity Extremes THINGS (LITTLE THINGS), although on average their amplitudes are a factor of ‚àº2 weaker than in our simulated discs. Our results indicate that bar-like patterns may arise even when baryons are not dominant, and that they are common enough to warrant careful consideration when analysing the gas kinematics of dwarf galaxy discs.}",

Whereas for many lens systems such simple mass models yield a remarkably good description of the observed properties, there are some systems which are notoriously difficult to understand quantitatively. We argue that at least in one case (B 1422 + 231) these difficulties are not (solely) due to a ‚Äòwrong‚Äô parametrization of the lens model, but that the discrepancy between observed and model-predicted flux ratios is due to substructure in the lens. As in microlensing for optical fluxes, such substructure can distort also the radio flux ratios predicted by ‚Äòsimple‚Äô mass models, in particular for highly magnified images, without appreciably changing image positions. Substructure also does not change the time delay significantly, and therefore has little effect on the determination of the Hubble constant using time delays. We quantify these statements with several simple scenarios for substructure, and propose a strategy to model lens systems in which substructure is suspected.}",

    abstract = "{Strong gravitational lensing provides a powerful test of cold dark matter (CDM) as it enables the detection and mass measurement of low-mass haloes even if they do not contain baryons. Compact lensed sources such as active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are particularly sensitive to perturbing subhaloes, but their use as a test of CDM has been limited by the small number of systems which have significant radio emission that is extended enough to avoid significant lensing by stars in the plane of the lens galaxy, and red enough to be minimally affected by differential dust extinction. Narrow-line emission is a promising alternative as it is also extended and, unlike radio, detectable in virtually all optically selected AGN lenses. We present first results from a Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) grism narrow-line survey of lensed quasars, for the quadruply lensed AGN HE 0435‚àí1223. Using a forward modelling pipeline that enables us to robustly account for spatial blending, we measure the [O¬†iii] 5007¬†√Ö flux ratios of the four images. We find that the [O¬†iii] fluxes and positions are well fit by a simple smooth mass model for the main lens. Our data rule out a M600 \\&gt; 108(107.2)‚ÄâM‚äô Navarro‚ÄìFrenk‚ÄìWhite perturber projected within ‚àº1.0 (0.1)¬†arcsec of each of the lensed images, where M600 is the perturber mass within its central 600¬†pc. The non-detection is broadly consistent with the expectations of ŒõCDM for a single system. The sensitivity achieved demonstrates that powerful limits on the nature of dark matter can be obtained with the analysis of ‚àº20 narrow-line lenses.}",

    abstract = "{The flux-ratio anomalies observed in multiply lensed quasar images are most plausibly explained as the result of perturbing structures superposed on the underlying smooth matter distribution of the primary lens. The cold dark matter cosmological model predicts that a large number of substructures should survive inside larger haloes but, surprisingly, this population alone has been shown to be insufficient to explain the observed distribution of the flux ratios of quasars‚Äô multiple images. Other haloes (and their subhaloes) projected along the line of sight to the primary lens have been considered as additional sources of perturbation. In this work, we use ray tracing through the Millennium II simulation to investigate the importance of projection effects due to haloes and subhaloes of mass m \\&gt; 108h‚àí1 M‚äô and extend our analysis to lower masses, m‚â• 106h‚àí1 M‚äô, using Monte Carlo halo distributions. We find that the magnitude of the violation depends strongly on the density profile and concentration of the intervening haloes, but clustering plays only a minor role. For a typical lensing geometry (lens at a redshift of 0.6 and source at a redshift of 2), background haloes (behind the main lens) are more likely to cause a violation than foreground haloes. We conclude that line-of-sight structures can be as important as intrinsic substructures in causing flux-ratio anomalies. The combined effect of perturbing structures within the lens and along the line of sight in the Œõ cold dark matter (ŒõCDM) universe results in a cusp-violation probability of 20‚Äì30 per cent. This alleviates the discrepancy between models and current data, but a larger observational sample is required for a stronger test of the theory.}",

    abstract = "{We investigate the properties of dark matter substructure in the gravitational lens HE 0435‚àí1223 (zl=0.455) via its effects on the positions and flux ratios of the quadruply imaged background quasar (zs= 1.689). We start with a smooth mass model, add individual, truncated isothermal clumps near the lensed images and use the Bayesian evidence to compare the quality of different models. Compared with smooth models, models with at least one clump near image A are strongly favoured. The mass of this clump within its Einstein radius is log10(MAEin) = 7.65+0.87‚àí 0.84 (in units of h‚àí170‚ÄÉM‚äô). The Bayesian evidence provides weaker support for a second clump near image B, with log10(MBEin) = 6.55+1.01‚àí 1.51. We also examine models with a full population of substructure, and find the mass fraction in substructure at the Einstein radius to be fsub\\&gt;rsim 0.000‚ÄÉ77, assuming the total clump masses follow a mass function dN/dM‚àùM‚àí1.9 over the range M= 107‚Äì1010‚ÄÉM‚äô. Few-clump and population models produce similar Bayesian evidence values, so neither type of model is objectively favoured.}",

	abstract = {We present 11.2‚ÄâŒºm observations of the gravitationally lensed, radio-loud zs = 2.64 quasar MG0414+0534, obtained using the Michelle camera on Gemini North. We find a flux ratio anomaly of A2/A1 = 0.93 ¬± 0.02 for the quasar images A1 and A2. When combined with the 11.7‚ÄâŒºm measurements from Minezaki et al., the A2/A1 flux ratio is nearly 5œÉ from the expected ratio for a model based on the two visible lens galaxies. The mid-IR flux ratio anomaly can be explained by a satellite (substructure), 0.‚Ä≥3 northeast of image A2, as can the detailed very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) structures of the jet produced by the quasar. When we combine the mid-IR flux ratios with high-resolution VLBI measurements, we find a best-fit mass between 106.2 and 107.5‚ÄâM‚òâ inside the Einstein radius for a satellite substructure modeled as a singular isothermal sphere at the redshift of the main lens (zl = 0.96). We are unable to set an interesting limit on the mass to light ratio due to its proximity to the quasar image A2. While the observations used here were technically difficult, surveys of flux anomalies in gravitational lenses with the James Webb Space Telescope will be simple, fast, and should well constrain the abundance of substructure in dark matter halos.}

    abstract = "{The cold dark matter (CDM) model for galaxy formation predicts that a significant fraction of mass in the dark matter haloes that surround L‚àºL* galaxies is bound in substructures of mass 104‚Äì107 M‚äô. The number of observable baryonic substructures (such as dwarf galaxies and globular clusters) falls short of these predictions by at least an order of magnitude. We present a method for searching for substructure in the haloes of gravitational lenses that produce multiple images of quasi-stellar objects (QSOs), such as four-image Einstein Cross lenses. Current methods based on broad-band flux ratios cannot cleanly distinguish between substructure, differential extinction, scattering in the radio by ionized regions in the lens galaxy, microlensing by stars and, most importantly, ambiguities in the host lens model. These difficulties may be overcome by utilizing the prediction that, when substructure is present, the magnification will be a function of source size. QSO broad-line and narrow-line emission regions are ‚àº1 pc and \\&gt;100 pc in size, respectively. The radio emission region is typically intermediate to these and the continuum emission region is much smaller. When narrow-line region (NLR) features are used as a normalization, the relative intensity and equivalent width of broad-line region (BLR) features will respectively reflect substructure-lensing and microlensing effects. Spectroscopic observations of just a few image pairs would probably be able to extract the desired substructure signature cleanly and distinguish it from microlensing ‚Äî depending on the actual level of projected mass in substructure. In the rest-optical, the HŒ≤/[O iii] region is ideal, since the narrow wavelength range also largely eliminates differential reddening problems. In the rest-ultraviolet, the region longward of and including LyŒ± may also work. Simulations of Q 2237+0305 are done as an example, to determine the level of substructure that is detectable in this way. Possible systematic difficulties are also discussed. This is an ideal experiment to be carried out with near-infrared integral field unit spectrographs on 8-m class telescopes, and will provide a fundamentally new probe of the internal structure of dark matter haloes.}",

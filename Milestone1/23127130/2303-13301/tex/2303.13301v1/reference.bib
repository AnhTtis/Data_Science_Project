	abstract = {The assumption that quantum systems relax to a stationary state in the long-time limit underpins statistical physics and much of our intuitive understanding of scientific phenomena. For isolated systems this follows from the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. When an environment is present the expectation is that all of phase space is explored, eventually leading to stationarity. Notable exceptions are decoherence-free subspaces that have important implications for quantum technologies and have so far only been studied for systems with a few degrees of freedom. Here we identify simple and generic conditions for dissipation to prevent a quantum many-body system from ever reaching a stationary state. We go beyond dissipative quantum state engineering approaches towards controllable long-time non-stationarity typically associated with macroscopic complex systems. This coherent and oscillatory evolution constitutes a dissipative version of a quantum time crystal. We discuss the possibility of engineering such complex dynamics with fermionic ultracold atoms in optical lattices.},

Starting from the simple two-level atom-small sample Dicke model, we successively introduce various complications inherent to a realistic superradiance experiment: effects of Van der Waals interaction between the atoms, propagation and diffraction of the electromagnetic field in the sample and finally the effects related to atomic level degeneracy or near degeneracy. We recall how to calculate the field radiated by a superradiant system in a single experiment and how to determine, for a series of identically prepared superradiant samples, the large shot to shot fluctuations of the emitted light properties. The presentation tries to unify various points of view and formalisms developed in previous works and to introduce simply and progressively the basic physical concepts relevant to the superradiance phenomenon.}

journal = {New Journal of Physics},
abstract = {We present a detailed study on the possibility of manipulating quantum information encoded in the ‘radial’ modes of arrays of trapped ions (i.e. in the ions' oscillations orthogonal to the trap's main axis). In such systems, because of the tightness of transverse confinement, the radial modes pertaining to different ions can be addressed individually. In the first part of the paper we show that, if local control of the radial trapping frequencies is available, any linear optical and squeezing operation on the locally defined modes—on single as well as on many modes—can be reproduced by manipulating the frequencies. Then, we proceed to describe schemes apt to generate unprecedented degrees of bipartite and multipartite continuous variable (CV) entanglement under realistic noisy working conditions and even restricting only to a global control of the trapping frequencies. Furthermore, we consider the transmission of the quantum information encoded in the radial modes along the array of ions, and show it to be possible to a remarkable degree of accuracy, for both finite-dimensional and CV quantum states. Finally, as an application, we show that the states which can be generated in this setting allow for the violation of multipartite non-locality tests, by feasible displaced parity measurements. Such a demonstration would be a first test of quantum non-locality for ‘massive’ degrees of freedom (i.e. for degrees of freedom describing the motion of massive particles).}

We derive the (bipartite) entanglement generation conditions for Gaussian non-Markovian dynamical maps and show that they are similar as in the Markovian regime. However, they depend on different physical coefficients and hold on different time scales. Indeed, for small times, in the non-Markovian regime entanglement is possibly generated on a shorter time scale () than in the Markovian regime (). Moreover, although the singular coupling limit of non-Markovian dynamics yields Markovian ones, we show that the same limit does not lead from non-Markovian entanglement generation conditions to Markovian ones. Also, entanglement generation conditions do not depend on the initial time for non-Markovian open dynamics resulting from couplings to bosonic Gaussian baths, while they may depend on time for open dynamics originated by couplings to classical, stochastic Gaussian environments.}

abstract="Decoherence is the phenomenon of non-unitary dynamics that arises as a consequence of coupling between a system and its environment. It has important harmful implications for quantum information processing, and various solutions to the problem have been proposed. Here we provide a detailed a review of the theory of decoherence-free subspaces and subsystems, focusing on their usefulness for preservation of quantum information.",

abstract = {We demonstrate that a translation-invariant chain of interacting quantum systems can be used for high efficiency transfer of quantum entanglement and the generation of multiparticle entanglement over large distances and between arbitrary sites without the requirement of precise spatial or temporal control. The scheme is largely insensitive to disorder and random coupling strengths in the chain. We discuss harmonic oscillator systems both in the case of arbitrary Gaussian states and in situations when at most one excitation is in the system. The latter case, which we prove to be equivalent to an xy-spin chain, may be used to generate genuine multiparticle entanglement. Such a ‘quantum data bus’ may prove useful in future solid state architectures for quantum information processing.}

The reservoir is a spin-{\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}frac{\{}1{\}}{\{}2{\}}{\$}{\$} Ising transverse field chain thermally excited; the two defect spins couple to two spins of the chain which can be at a macroscopic distance. In the weak-coupling and low-temperature limit, the spin chain is mapped onto a bath of linearly interacting oscillators using the Holstein--Primakoff transformation. We analyze the time evolution of the density matrix of the two defect spins for transient times and deduce the entanglement which is generated by the common reservoir. We discuss several scenarios for different initial states of the two spins and for varying distances.},

@article{Eichenfield:2009,
	abstract = {In a photonic crystal, periodic variations of the refractive index of the host medium are used to manipulate the properties of light, whereas in a phononic crystal it is the mechanical vibrations that are subject to such control. Now Eichenfield et al. have constructed a silicon-chip-based device incorporating an engineered material combining both properties.. In the resulting 'optomechanical crystals', strong coupling between photons and phonons makes it possible to control both light and mechanical vibrations in a small space, resulting in an enhanced light--matter interaction. Possible applications for devices using optomechanical crystals include signal processing in photonics and electronics, or as sensitive detectors of tiny masses (such as biomolecules) with high spatial resolution.},

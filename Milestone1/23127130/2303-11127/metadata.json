    "abstract": "Spiking neural networks (SNNs), as a biology-inspired method mimicking the spiking nature of brain neurons, is a promising energy-efficient alternative to the traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs). The energy saving of SNNs is mainly from multiplication free property brought by binarized intermediate activations. In this paper, we proposed a Multiple Threshold (MT) approach to alleviate the precision loss brought by the binarized activations, such that SNNs can reach higher accuracy at fewer steps. We evaluate the approach on CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and DVS-CIFAR10, and demonstrate that MT can promote SNNs extensively, especially at early steps. For example, With MT, Parametric-Leaky-Integrate-Fire(PLIF) based VGG net can even outperform the ANN counterpart with 1 step.",

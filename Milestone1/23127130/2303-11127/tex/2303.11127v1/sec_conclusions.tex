\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, multiple threshold approach is proposed to augment the output of spiking layers, thus relieving the precision loss of SNNs comparing to float-based neural networks. We show that SNNs with multiple thresholds outperform state-of-the-art models with similar architectures, and tend to reach higher accuracy at fewer steps, thus providing us an option to make easier trade off between the number of steps and the quality.

\begin{proof} 
  By induction on $t \in \normal$. We consider two cases:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Case $t \in \val$. Then such a typing derivation can only end with rule (\ruleAx) followed by rule (\ruleLift) or (\ruleLamP)followed by rule (\ruleLift), in which cases the statement is obvious.
    \item Case $t = vu \in \neutral$. Since the first counter of the derivation is $0$, $\Phi$ can only end with a persistent rule (\ruleAppPOne) or (\ruleAppPTwo). In both cases, we can conclude by applying the \ih to $u \in \normal$ or $u \in \neutral$ and their type derivations, which gives  $\stype = \stype'$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{proof}

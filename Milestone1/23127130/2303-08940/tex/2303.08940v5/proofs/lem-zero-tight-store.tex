\begin{proof}
    By induction over $M \in \normal$: \begin{itemize}
        \item Case $M \in \ne$, then we have to consider two additional cases: \begin{itemize}
            \item Case $t = x u$. Then $N \in \normal$ and $\Phi_M$ must end with ($\ruleAppPOne$) or ($\ruleAppPTwo$), since $N$ should have a tight type by~\cref{lem:tight-zero}. In either case, we can conclude by applying the \ih to the type derivation for $N$, which will tell us that $\sig = \sig'$.
            \item Case $t = (\lam x.p)u$. Then $N \in \neutral \subseteq \normal$ and $\Phi_t$ must end with ($\ruleAppPOne$), since $N$ should have a tight type by~\cref{lem:tight-zero} and $\lam x.p$ cannot have type $\tvar$, by~\cref{prop:tightvalue}. But, then we can conclude by applying the \ih to the type derivation for $N$, which will tell us that $\sig = \sig'$.
        \end{itemize}

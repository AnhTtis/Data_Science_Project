By induction on $\Phi$: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Case $\Phi$ ends with ($\ruleApp$). This case does not apply, since it does not conclude with a tight type.
    \item Case $\Phi$ ends with ($\ruleAppPOne$). Then $t = v u$ and $\Phi \tr \seqi{\Gam' + \Del}{v u}{\tneutral}{(0,0,r'+r''+1)}$. Therefore, $\Phi_u \tr \seqi{\Gam'}{u}{\tneutral}{(0,0,r)}$ and $\Phi_V \tr \seqi{\Del}{V}{\tightv}{(0,0,0,r')}$ are tight. By the \ih, we have $r' = \size{u}$. By~\cref{prop:tightvaluezero}, we have $r'' = 0$. Therefore, $r = r'+r''+1 = \size{u} + 0 + 1 = \size{u} + \size{V} + 1 = \size{v u}$.
    \item Case $\Phi$ ends with ($\ruleAppPTwo$). Then $t = v u$ and $\Phi \tr \seqi{\Gam' + \Del}{v u}{\tneutral}{(0,0,0,r'+r''+1)}$. Therefore, $\Phi_u \tr \seqi{\Gam'}{u}{\tightt}{(0,0,r)}$ and $\Phi_V \tr \seqi{\Del}{v}{\tvar}{(0,0,0,r')}$ are tight. By the \ih, we have $r' = \size{u}$. By~\cref{prop:tightvaluezero}, we have $r'' = 0$. Therefore, $r = r'+r''+1 = \size{u} + 0 + 1 = \size{u} + \size{v} + 1 = \size{v u}$.
    \item Case $\Phi$ ends with ($\ruleGet$). This case does not apply, since it does not conclude with a tight type.
    \item Case $\Phi$ ends with ($\ruleSet$). This case does not apply, since it does not conclude with a tight type.

\begin{proof}
    By induction over $\Phi$:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Case $\Phi$ ends with rule (\ruleAx), (\ruleLam), (\ruleLamP), or (\ruleMany). These cases do not apply since they do not end with a monadic type.
        \item Case $\Phi$ ends with rule (\ruleApp), (\ruleGet), (\ruleSet), (\ruleAppPOne), or (\ruleAppPTwo), then $\neg\isabs{t}$ holds by definition.
        \item Case $\Phi$ ends with rule (\ruleLift), then we have to consider three cases, depending on the form of $\mu$:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item If $\mu = \M$, then $\tau \in \nott{\tabs}$ does not hold.
            \item If $\mu = \tvar$, then $t = x$. Therefore, $\neg\isabs{x}$ holds by definition.
            \item If $\mu = \tabs$, then $\tau \in \nott{\tabs}$ does not hold.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{proof}

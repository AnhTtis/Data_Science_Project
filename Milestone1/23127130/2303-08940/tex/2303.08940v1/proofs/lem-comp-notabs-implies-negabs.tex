\begin{proof}
    By induction over $\Phi$:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Case $\Phi$ ends with rule (\ruleAx), (\ruleApp), (\ruleGet), (\ruleSet), (\ruleAxP) (\ruleAppPOne), or (\ruleAppPTwo), then $\neg\isabs{t}$ holds by definition.
        \item Case $\Phi$ ends with rule (\ruleLam), (\ruleMany), or (\ruleLamP), then $\tau \in \nott{\tabs}$ does not hold. Therefore, these cases do not apply.
    \end{itemize}
\end{proof}

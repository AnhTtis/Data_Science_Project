%\begin{proof}
    We will actually prove the following stronger version of the statement, which allows us to reason inductively:

    Let $\Phi_t \tr \seqi{\Gam}{t}{\tau}{(b,s)}$, such that $\Gam$ is tight, and either $\tau$ is tight or $\neg\isvalue{t}$. If $t \dred t'$, then there exists $\Phi_{t'} \tr \seqi{\Gam}{t'}{\tau}{(b-1,s)}$.

    The proof now follows by induction over $\dred$:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Case $t = (\lam x.u) v \dred u \subs{x}{v} = t'$.Assume that $\Phi_t$ ends with rule (\ruleAppPOne). Then $\lam x.u$ must be assigned type $\nott{\tabs}$, which is not possible by~\cref{lem:notabs-implies-negabs}. Now, assume that $\Phi_t$ ends with rule (\ruleAppPTwo). Then $v$ must be assigned typed $\tneutral$, which is not possible by~\cref{lem:values-not-neutral}. Therefore, $\Phi_t$ must be of the following form:
        \[ \begin{prooftree}
            \hypo{\Phi_u \tr \seqi{\Gam_u; x : \M}{u}{\tau}{(b_u,s_u)}}
            \infer1[(\ruleLam)]{\seqi{\Gam_u}{(\lam x.u)}{\M \ta \tau}{(b_u, s_u)}}
            \hypo{\Phi_{v} \tr \seqi{\Gam_v}{v}{\M}{(b_v,s_v)}}
            \infer2[(\ruleApp)]{\seqi{\Gam_u + \Gam_{v}}{(\lam x.u) v}{\tau}{(1+b_u+b_v, s_u+s_v)}}
        \end{prooftree} \]
        where $\tau \in \tightt$, $\Gam = \Gam_u + \Gam_v$ is tight, $b = 1 + b_u + b_v$, and $s = s_u + s_v$. By~\cref{lem:subsantisubs}.\ref{lem:subs}, we know there exists the following derivation $\Phi_{u \subs{x}{v}} \tr \seqi{\Gam_u + \Gam_v}{u \subs{x}{v}}{\tau}{(b_u+b_v,s_u+s_v)}$. So we can take $\Phi_{t'} = \Phi_{u \subs{x}{v}}$ and conclude with $b - 1 = b_u + b_v$.
        \item Case $t = up \dred u'p = t'$, such that $u \dred u'$. Then $\Phi_t$ must either end with (\ruleApp), (\ruleAppPOne), or (\ruleAppPTwo):
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Case $\Phi_t$ ends with rule (\ruleApp), then it must be of the following form:
            \[ \begin{prooftree}
                \hypo{\Phi_u \tr \seqi{\Gam_u}{u}{\M \ta \tau}{(b_u,s_u)}}
                \hypo{\Phi_p \tr \seqi{\Gam_p}{p}{\M}{(b_p,s_p)}}
                \infer2[(\ruleApp)]{\seqi{\Gam_u + \Gam_p}{up}{\tau}{(1 +b_u+b_p,s_u+s_p)}}
            \end{prooftree} \]
            where $\tau = \tau \in \tightt$, $\Gam = \Gam_u + \Gam_p$ is tight, $b = 1+b_u + b_p$, and $s = s_u + s_p$. Since $u \dred u'$, it is clear that $\neg\isvalue{u}$ holds. Moreover, $\Gam_u$ is necessarily tight. Therefore, by the \ih, there exists $\Phi_{u'} \tr \seqi{\Gam_u}{u'}{\M \ta \tau}{(b_u-1, s_u)}$. Thus, we can build $\Phi_{t'}$ as follows:
            \[ \begin{prooftree}
                \hypo{\Phi_{u'} \tr \seqi{\Gam_u}{u'}{\M \ta \tau}{(b_u-1, s_u)}}
                \hypo{\Phi_p \tr \seqi{\Gam_p}{p}{\M}{(b_p,s_p)}}
                \infer2[(\ruleApp)]{\seqi{\Gam_u + \Gam_p}{u'p}{\tau}{(b_u+b_p,s_u+s_p)}}
            \end{prooftree} \]
            And we can conclude with $b - 1= b_u + b_p$.
            \item Case $\Phi_t$ ends with rule (\ruleAppPOne) or (\ruleAppPTwo), the proof are similar to the one where $\Phi_t$ ends with rule (\ruleApp).
        \end{itemize}
        \item Case $t = up \dred up' = t'$, such that $u \not\dred$ and $p \dred p'$. Then $\Phi_t$ must either end with (\ruleApp), (\ruleAppPOne), or (\ruleAppPTwo):
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Case $\Phi_t$ ends with rule (\ruleApp), then it must be of the following form:
            \[ \begin{prooftree}
                \hypo{\Phi_u \tr \seqi{\Gam_u}{u}{\M \ta \tau}{(b_u,s_u)}}
                \hypo{\Phi_p \tr \seqi{\Gam_p}{p}{\M}{(b_p,s_p)}}
                \infer2[(\ruleApp)]{\seqi{\Gam_u + \Gam_p}{up}{\tau}{(1+b_u+b_p,s_u+s_p)}}
            \end{prooftree} \]
            where $\tau \in \tightt$, $\Gam = \Gam_u + \Gam_p$ is tight, $b = 1 + b_u + b_p$, and $s = s_u + s_p$. Since $p \dred p'$, it is clear that $\neg\isvalue{p}$. Moreover, $\Gam_p$ is necessarily tight. Therefore, by the \ih, we know there exists the following derivation $\Phi_{p'} \tr \seqi{\Gam_p}{p'}{\M}{(b_p-1, s_p)}$. Thus, we can build $\Phi_{t'}$ as follows:
            \[ \begin{prooftree}
                \hypo{\Phi_u \tr \seqi{\Gam_u}{u}{\M \ta \tau}{(b_u, s_u)}}
                \hypo{\Phi_{p'} \tr \seqi{\Gam_p}{p'}{\M}{(b_p-1,s_p)}}
                \infer2[(\ruleApp)]{\seqi{\Gam_u + \Gam_p}{up'}{\tau}{(b_u+b_p,s_u+s_p)}}
            \end{prooftree} \]
            And we can conclude with $b - 1 = b_u + b_p$.
            \item Case $\Phi_t$ ends with rule (\ruleAppPOne) or (\ruleAppPTwo), the proofs are similar to the ones where $\Phi_t$ ends with rule (\ruleApp).
        \end{itemize}

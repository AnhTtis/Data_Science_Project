    "abstract": "A general method of separating isotopes by centrifuging dissolved chemical compounds in a liquid solution is introduced. This technique can be applied to almost all elements and leads to large separation factors. The method has been demonstrated in several isotopic systems including Ca, Mo, O, and Li with single-stage selectivities of 1.046-1.067 per unit mass difference (e.g., 1.434 in 40Ca/48Ca, 1.134 in 16O/18O), which are beyond the capabilities of various conventional methods of isotope enrichment. Equations are derived to model the process and the results agree with those of the experiments. The scalability of the technique has been demonstrated by performing a three-stage enrichment of 48Ca, and the scalability is more broadly supported through analogies to the gas centrifuge, whereby countercurrent centrifugation can further multiply the separation factor by 5-10 times per stage in a continuous process. Optimal centrifuge conditions and solutions can achieve both high-throughput and highly efficient isotope separation.",

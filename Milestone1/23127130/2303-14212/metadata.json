    "abstract": "J.-P. Roudneff conjectured in 1991 that every arrangement of $n \\ge 2d+1\\ge 5$ pseudohyperplanes in the real projective space $\\mathbb{P}^d$ has at most $\\sum_{i=0}^{d-2} \\binom{n-1}{i}$ complete cells (i.e., cells bounded by each hyperplane). The conjecture is true for $d=2,3$ and for arrangements arising from Lawrence oriented matroids. The main result of this manuscript is to show the validity of Roudneff's conjecture for $d=4$. Moreover, based on computational data we conjecture that the maximum number of complete cells is only obtained by cyclic arrangements.",

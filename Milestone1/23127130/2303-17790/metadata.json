    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a game-theoretic modeling framework for studying the travel behavior in mobility systems, by incorporating prospect theory. As part of our motivation, we conducted an experiment in a scaled smart city to investigate the frequency of errors in actual and perceived probabilities of a highway route under free flow conditions. Based on these findings, we provide a game that captures how travelers distribute their traffic flows in a transportation network with splittable traffic, utilizing the Bureau of Public Roads function to establish the relationship between traffic flow and travel time cost. Given the inherent non-linearities, we propose a smooth approximation function that helps us estimate the prospect-theoretic cost functions. As part of our analysis, we characterize the best-fit parameters and derive an upper bound for the error. We then show a Nash Equilibrium existence. Finally, we present a numerical example and simulations to verify the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approximation.",

    "abstract": "The type-II seesaw model can explain neutrino masses and address the baryon asymmetry problem of the Universe simultaneously. In this letter, we explore its phase transition and the resulting gravitational wave signals. We find a strong first-order electroweak phase transition generically prefers a relatively light triplet in the $300\\sim500$GeV range, which is ideal for collider searches and can generate gravitational waves within the sensitivity reach of BBO and Ultimate-DECIGO. While above $\\sim$1TeV where a future 100TeV $pp$ collider will play a key role in model discovery, we integrate out the triplet and perform a global fit analysis of this model at various future colliders. A lower bound in the $10^{-3}\\sim10^{-2}$eV range on the triplet vacuum expectation value is obtained, which is comparable to or even better than that from current $μ\\to eγ$ experiments depending on the lightest neutrino mass.",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art electron microscopes such as scanning electron microscopes (SEM), scanning transmission electron microscopes (STEM) and transmission electron microscopes (TEM) have become increasingly sophisticated. However, the quality of experimental images is often hampered by stochastic and deterministic distortions arising from the instrument or its environment. These distortions can arise during any stage of the imaging process, including image acquisition, transmission, or visualization. In this paper, we will discuss the main sources of distortion in TEM and S(T)EM images, develop models to describe them and propose a method to correct these distortions using a convolutional neural network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a variety of experimental images and show that it can significantly improve the signal-to-noise ratio resulting in an increase in the amount of quantitative structural information that can be extracted from the image. Overall, our findings provide a powerful framework for improving the quality of electron microscopy images and advancing the field of structural analysis and quantification in materials science and biology.",

  abstract        = {The physical basis for using a probe-position integrated cross section (PICS) for a single column of atoms as an effective way to compare simulation and experiment in high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) is described, and the use of PICS in order to make quantitative use of image intensities is evaluated. It is based upon the calibration of the detector and the measurement of scattered intensities. Due to the predominantly incoherent nature of HAADF STEM, it is found to be robust to parameters that affect probe size and shape such as defocus and source coherence. The main imaging parameter dependencies are on detector angle and accelerating voltage, which are well known. The robustness to variation in other parameters allows for a quantitative comparison of experimental data and simulation without the need to fit parameters. By demonstrating the application of the PICS to the chemical identification of single atoms in a heterogeneous catalyst and in thin, layered-materials, we explore some of the experimental considerations when using this approach. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.

This new program performs accurate and fast multislice simulations by including higher order expansion of the multislice solution of the high energy Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation, the correct subslicing of the three-dimensional potential and top-bottom surfaces. The program implements different kinds of simulation for CTEM, STEM, ED, PED, CBED, ADF-TEM and ABF-HC with proper treatment of the spatial and temporal incoherences. The multislice approach described here treats the specimen as amorphous material which allows a straightforward implementation of the frozen phonon approximation. The generalized transmission function for each slice is calculated when is needed and then discarded. This allows us to perform large simulations that can include millions of atoms and keep the computer memory requirements to a reasonable level.},

The Einstein model for phonon vibrations in a crystal leads to Gaussian statistics for the phonons. However, the Einstein model ignores the possibility of correlation between the atoms. An accurate model of the phonon dispersion curves for silicon is used to generate a set of more accurate random atomic displacements. These displacements are used in a multislice-style simulation to gauge the validity of the Einstein approximation. The phonon dispersion curve yields a small additional oscillatory structure in the thermal diffuse scattering (TDS) pattern. This does not produce significant changes in the annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscope (ADF-STEM) image signal, but could have a large impact on convergent beam measurements of bond charges. {\textcopyright} 2001.},

In this paper we show that measurement of image intensities relative to the intensity of the incoming electron beam allows direct comparison with simulated image intensities, and thus quantitative measurement of specimen thickness and composition. Simulations were carried out with the frozen lattice and absorptive potential multislice methods. The radial inhomogeneity of the detector was measured and taken into account. Using a focused ion beam (FIB) prepared specimen we first demonstrate that specimen thicknesses obtained in this way are in very good agreement with a direct measurement of the thickness of the lamella by scanning electron microscopy in the FIB. In the second step we apply this method to evaluate the composition of Alx Ga1 - x N / GaN layers. We measured ratios of image intensities obtained in regions with unknown and with known Al-concentration x, respectively. We show that estimation of the specimen thickness combined with evaluation of intensity ratios allows quantitative measurement of the composition x. In high-resolution images we find that the image intensity is well described by simulation if the simulated image is convoluted with a Gaussian with a half-width at half-maximum of 0. 07 nm. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.

In this work, we study rectifier neural networks for image classification from two aspects. First, we propose a Parametric Rectified Linear Unit (PReLU) that generalizes the traditional rectified unit. PReLU improves model fitting with nearly zero extra computational cost and little overfitting risk. Second, we derive a robust initialization method that particularly considers the rectifier nonlinearities. This method enables us to train extremely deep rectified models directly from scratch and to investigate deeper or wider network architectures. Based on the learnable activation and advanced initialization, we achieve 4. 94% top-5 test error on the ImageNet 2012 classification dataset. This is a 26% relative improvement over the ILSVRC 2014 winner (GoogLeNet, 6. 66% [33]). To our knowledge, our result is the first to surpass the reported human-level performance (5. 1%, [26]) on this dataset.},

  abstract        = {Recent research on image denoising has progressed with the development of deep learning architectures, especially convolutional neural networks. However, real-world image denoising is still very challenging because it is not possible to obtain ideal pairs of ground-truth images and real-world noisy images. Owing to the recent release of benchmark datasets, the interest of the image denoising community is now moving toward the real-world denoising problem. In this paper, we propose a grouped residual dense network (GRDN), which is an extended and generalized architecture of the state-of-the-art residual dense network (RDN). The core part of RDN is defined as grouped residual dense block (GRDB) and used as a building module of GRDN. We experimentally show that the image denoising performance can be significantly improved by cascading GRDBs. In addition to the network architecture design, we also develop a new generative adversarial network-based real-world noise modeling method. We demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods by achieving the highest score in terms of both the peak signal-to-noise ratio and the structural similarity in the NTIRE2019 Real Image Denoising Challenge - Track 2:sRGB.},

The participating teams were solving a real-world photo enhancement problem, where the goal was to map low-quality photos from the iPhone 3GS device to the same photos captured with Canon 70D DSLR camera. The considered problem embraced a number of computer vision subtasks, such as image denoising, image resolution and sharpness enhancement, image color/contrast/exposure adjustment, etc. The target metric used in this challenge combined PSNR and SSIM scores with solutions' perceptual results measured in the user study. The proposed solutions significantly improved baseline results, defining the state-of-the-art for practical image enhancement.},

However, most deep CNN based SR models do not make full use of the hierarchical features from the original low-resolution (LR) images, thereby achieving relatively-low performance. In this paper, we propose a novel residual dense network (RDN) to address this problem in image SR. We fully exploit the hierarchical features from all the convolutional layers. Specifically, we propose residual dense block (RDB) to extract abundant local features via dense connected convolutional layers. RDB further allows direct connections from the state of preceding RDB to all the layers of current RDB, leading to a contiguous memory (CM) mechanism. Local feature fusion in RDB is then used to adaptively learn more effective features from preceding and current local features and stabilizes the training of wider network. After fully obtaining dense local features, we use global feature fusion to jointly and adaptively learn global hierarchical features in a holistic way. Experiments on benchmark datasets with different degradation models show that our RDN achieves favorable performance against state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract        = {Convolutional neural network (CNN) depth is of crucial importance for image super-resolution (SR). However, we observe that deeper networks for image SR are more difficult to train. The low-resolution inputs and features contain abundant low-frequency information, which is treated equally across channels, hence hindering the representational ability of CNNs. To solve these problems, we propose the very deep residual channel attention networks (RCAN). Specifically, we propose a residual in residual (RIR) structure to form very deep network, which consists of several residual groups with long skip connections. Each residual group contains some residual blocks with short skip connections. Meanwhile, RIR allows abundant low-frequency information to be bypassed through multiple skip connections, making the main network focus on learning high-frequency information. Furthermore, we propose a channel attention mechanism to adaptively rescale channel-wise features by considering interdependencies among channels. Extensive experiments show that our RCAN achieves better accuracy and visual improvements against state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract        = {Non-local methods exploiting the self-similarity of natural signals have been well studied, for example in image analysis and restoration. Existing approaches, however, rely on k-nearest neighbors (KNN) matching in a fixed feature space. The main hurdle in optimizing this feature space w. r. t. application performance is the non-differentiability of the KNN selection rule. To overcome this, we propose a continuous deterministic relaxation of KNN selection that maintains differentiability w. r. t. pairwise distances, but retains the original KNN as the limit of a temperature parameter approaching zero. To exploit our relaxation, we propose the neural nearest neighbors block (N3 block), a novel non-local processing layer that leverages the principle of self-similarity and can be used as building block in modern neural network architectures. We show its effectiveness for the set reasoning task of correspondence classification as well as for image restoration, including image denoising and single image super-resolution, where we outperform strong convolutional neural network (CNN) baselines and recent non-local models that rely on KNN selection in hand-chosen features spaces.},

  abstract        = {The discriminative model learning for image denoising has been recently attracting considerable attentions due to its favorable denoising performance. In this paper, we take one step forward by investigating the construction of feed-forward denoising convolutional neural networks (DnCNNs) to embrace the progress in very deep architecture, learning algorithm, and regularization method into image denoising. Specifically, residual learning and batch normalization are utilized to speed up the training process as well as boost the denoising performance. Different from the existing discriminative denoising models which usually train a specific model for additive white Gaussian noise at a certain noise level, our DnCNN model is able to handle Gaussian denoising with unknown noise level (i. e. , blind Gaussian denoising). With the residual learning strategy, DnCNN implicitly removes the latent clean image in the hidden layers. This property motivates us to train a single DnCNN model to tackle with several general image denoising tasks, such as Gaussian denoising, single image super-resolution, and JPEG image deblocking. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our DnCNN model can not only exhibit high effectiveness in several general image denoising tasks, but also be efficiently implemented by benefiting from GPU computing.},

The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.},

  abstract        = {Face manipulation has shown remarkable advances with the flourish of Generative Adversarial Networks. However, due to the difficulties of controlling the structure and texture in high-resolution, it is challenging to simultaneously model pose and expression during manipulation. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that simplifies face manipulation with extreme pose and expression into two correlated stages: a boundary prediction stage and a disentangled face synthesis stage. In the first stage, we propose to use a boundary image for joint pose and expression modeling. An encoder-decoder network is employed to predict the boundary image of the target face in a semi-supervised way. Pose and expression estimators are employed to improve the prediction accuracy. In the second stage, the predicted boundary image and the original face are encoded into the structure and texture latent space by two encoder networks respectively. A proxy network and a feature threshold loss are further imposed to disentangle the latent space. Furthermore, considering the lack of high-resolution face databases to verify the effectiveness of our method, we collect a new high quality Multi-View Face (MVF-HQ) database in 6000 {\$}\backslashtimes{\$} 4000 resolution. It contains 120,283 images from 479 identities with diverse pose, expression and illumination variants, which is much larger in scale and much higher in resolution than the current public high-resolution face manipulation databases. We expect it to push forward the advance of face manipulation. Qualitative and quantitative experiments on four databases show that our method dramatically improves the visualization of face manipulation.},

We demonstrate that this approach is effective at synthesizing photos from label maps, reconstructing objects from edge maps, and colorizing images, among other tasks. Indeed, since the release of the pix2pix software associated with this paper, a large number of internet users (many of them artists) have posted their own experiments with our system, further demonstrating its wide applicability and ease of adoption without the need for parameter tweaking. As a community, we no longer hand-engineer our mapping functions, and this work suggests we can achieve reasonable results without hand-engineering our loss functions either.},

Most systems use only one stage of feature extraction in which the filters are hard-wired, or two stages where the filters in one or both stages are learned in supervised or unsupervised mode. This paper addresses three questions: 1. How does the non-linearities that follow the filter banks influence the recognition accuracy? 2. does learning the filter banks in an unsupervised or supervised manner improve the performance over random filters or hardwired filters? 3. Is there any advantage to using an architecture with two stages of feature extraction, rather than one? We show that using non-linearities that include rectification and local contrast normalization is the single most important ingredient for good accuracy on object recognition benchmarks. We show that two stages of feature extraction yield better accuracy than one. Most surprisingly, we show that a two-stage system with random filters can yield almost 63\% recognition rate on Caltech-101, provided that the proper non-linearities and pooling layers are used. Finally, we show that with supervised refinement, the system achieves state-of-the-art performance on NORB dataset (5.6\%) and unsupervised pre-training followed by supervised refinement produces good accuracy on Caltech-101 ({$>$} 65\%), and the lowest known error rate on the undistorted, unprocessed MNIST dataset (0.53\%).},

  abstract        = {Convolutional autoencoders (CAEs) are unsupervised feature extractors for high-resolution images. In the pre-processing step, whitening transformation has widely been adopted to remove redundancy by making adjacent pixels less correlated. Pooling is a biologically inspired operation to reduce the resolution of feature maps and achieve spatial invariance in convolutional neural networks. Conventionally, pooling methods are mainly determined empirically in most previous work. Therefore, our main purpose is to study the relationship between whitening processing and pooling operations in convolutional autoencoders for image classification. We propose an adaptive pooling approach based on the concepts of information entropy to test the effect of whitening on pooling in different conditions. Experimental results on benchmark datasets indicate that the performance of pooling strategies is associated with the distribution of feature activations, which can be affected by whitening processing. This provides guidance for the selection of pooling methods in convolutional autoencoders and other convolutional neural networks.},

  abstract        = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization, and in some cases eliminates the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4. 82{\%} top-5 test error, exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

  abstract        = {In standard generative adversarial network (SGAN), the discriminator D estimates the probability that the input data is real. The generator G is trained to increase the probability that fake data is real. We argue that it should also simultaneously decrease the probability that real data is real because 1) this would account for a priori knowledge that half of the data in the mini-batch is fake, 2) this would be observed with divergence minimization, and 3) SGAN would be more similar to integral probability metric (IPM) GANs. We show that this property can be induced by using a “relativistic discriminator” which estimate the probability that the given real data is more realistic than a randomly sampled fake data. We also present a variant in which the discriminator estimate the probability that the given real data is more realistic than fake data, on average. We generalize both approaches to non-standard GAN loss functions and we refer to them respectively as Relativistic GANs (RGANs) and Relativistic average GANs (RaGANs). We show that IPM-based GANs are a subset of RGANs which use the identity function. Empirically, we observe that 1) RGANs and RaGANs are significantly more stable and generate higher quality data samples than their non-relativistic counterparts, 2) Standard RaGAN with gradient penalty generate data of better quality than WGAN-GP while only requiring a single discriminator update per generator update (reducing the time taken for reaching the state-of-the-art by 400{\%}), and 3) RaGANs are able to generate plausible high resolutions images (256x256) from a very small sample (N=2011), while GAN and LSGAN cannot; these images are of significantly better quality than the ones generated by WGAN-GP and SGAN with spectral normalization.

In this paper, we embrace this observation and introduce the Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet), which connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion. Whereas traditional convolutional networks with L layers have L connections - one between each layer and its subsequent layer - our network has L(L2+1) direct connections. For each layer, the feature-maps of all preceding layers are used as inputs, and its own feature-maps are used as inputs into all subsequent layers. DenseNets have several compelling advantages: they alleviate the vanishing-gradient problem, strengthen feature propagation, encourage feature reuse, and substantially reduce the number of parameters. We evaluate our proposed architecture on four highly competitive object recognition benchmark tasks (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet). DenseNets obtain significant improvements over the state-of-the-art on most of them, whilst requiring less computation to achieve high performance.

The former networks are able to encode multi-scale contextual information by probing the incoming features with filters or pooling operations at multiple rates and multiple effective fields-of-view, while the latter networks can capture sharper object boundaries by gradually recovering the spatial information. In this work, we propose to combine the advantages from both methods. Specifically, our proposed model, DeepLabv3+, extends DeepLabv3 by adding a simple yet effective decoder module to refine the segmentation results especially along object boundaries. We further explore the Xception model and apply the depthwise separable convolution to both Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling and decoder modules, resulting in a faster and stronger encoder-decoder network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model on PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes datasets, achieving the test set performance of 89{\%} and 82. 1{\%} without any post-processing.

Like playing golf, our method first estimates an aggressive propagation towards optimum using one network, and recurrently applies a residual CNN to learn the gradient of prior for delicate correction on restoration.

However, the hallucinated details are often accompanied with unpleasant artifacts. To further enhance the visual quality, we thoroughly study three key components of SRGAN – network architecture, adversarial loss and perceptual loss, and improve each of them to derive an Enhanced SRGAN (ESRGAN). In particular, we introduce the Residual-in-Residual Dense Block (RRDB) without batch normalization as the basic network building unit. Moreover, we borrow the idea from relativistic GAN to let the discriminator predict relative realness instead of the absolute value. Finally, we improve the perceptual loss by using the features before activation, which could provide stronger supervision for brightness consistency and texture recovery. Benefiting from these improvements, the proposed ESRGAN achieves consistently better visual quality with more realistic and natural textures than SRGAN and won the first place in the PIRM2018-SR Challenge (region 3) with the best perceptual index.

Previous solutions largely rely on handcrafted priors to compensate for this deficiency. Recent convolutional neural network (CNN) models have been used to learn haze-related priors but they ultimately work as advanced image filters. In this paper we propose a novel semantic ap- proach towards single image haze removal. Unlike existing methods, we infer color priors based on extracted semantic features. We argue that semantic context can be exploited to give informative cues for (a) learning color prior on clean image and (b) estimating ambient illumination. This design allowed our model to recover clean images from challenging cases with strong ambiguity, e.g. saturated illumination color and sky regions in image. In experiments, we validate our ap- proach upon synthetic and real hazy images, where our method showed superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches, suggesting semantic information facilitates the haze removal task.},

 abstract = {Summary: The usable aperture sizes in (scanning) transmission electron microscopy ((S)TEM) have significantly increased in the past decade due to the introduction of aberration correction. In parallel with the consequent increase of convergence angle the depth of focus has decreased severely and optical sectioning in the STEM became feasible. Here we apply STEM defocus series to derive the local sample thickness of a TEM sample. To this end experimental as well as simulated defocus series of thin Si foils were acquired. The systematic blurring of high resolution high angle annular dark field images is quantified by evaluating the standard deviation of the image intensity for each image of a defocus series. The derived dependencies exhibit a pronounced maximum at the optimum defocus and drop to a background value for higher or lower values. The full width half maximum (FWHM) of the curve is equal to the sample thickness above a minimum thickness given by the size of the used aperture and the chromatic aberration of the microscope. The thicknesses obtained from experimental defocus series applying the proposed method are in good agreement with the values derived from other established methods. The key advantages of this method compared to others are its high spatial resolution and that it does not involve any time consuming simulations. Journal compilation},

A nanoparticle's physical and chemical properties are controlled by its exact 3D morphology, structure and composition. Electron tomography enables the recovery of the shape of a nanoparticle from a series of projection images. Although atomic-resolution electron microscopy has been feasible for nearly four decades, neither electron tomography nor any other experimental technique has yet demonstrated atomic resolution in three dimensions. Here we report the 3D reconstruction of a complex crystalline nanoparticle at atomic resolution. To achieve this, we combined aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, statistical parameter estimation theory and discrete tomography. Unlike conventional electron tomography, only two images of the target - a silver nanoparticle embedded in an aluminium matrix - are sufficient for the reconstruction when combined with available knowledge about the particle's crystallographic structure. Additional projections confirm the reliability of the result. The results we present help close the gap between the atomic resolution achievable in two-dimensional electron micrographs and the coarser resolution that has hitherto been obtained by conventional electron tomography. {\textcopyright}2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

  abstract = {Pt nanoparticles play an essential role in a wide variety of catalytic reactions. The activity of the particles strongly depends on their three-dimensional (3D) structure and exposed facets, as well as on the reactive environment. High-resolution electron microscopy has often been used to characterize nanoparticle catalysts but unfortunately most observations so far have been either performed in vacuum and/or using conventional (2D) in situ microscopy. The latter however does not provide direct 3D morphological information. We have implemented a quantitative methodology to measure variations of the 3D atomic structure of nanoparticles under the flow of a selected gas. We were thereby able to quantify refaceting of Pt nanoparticles with atomic resolution during various oxidation-reduction cycles. In a H 2 environment, a more faceted surface morphology of the particles was observed with {\{}100{\}} and {\{}111{\}} planes being dominant. On the other hand, in O 2 the percentage of {\{}100{\}} and {\{}111{\}} facets decreased and a significant increase of higher order facets was found, resulting in a more rounded morphology. This methodology opens up new opportunities toward in situ characterization of catalytic nanoparticles because for the first time it enables one to directly measure 3D morphology variations at the atomic scale in a specific gaseous reaction environment.},

  abstract        = {The origin of incoherent imaging in STEM has been analysed by investigating the effects of the detector geometry and of the thermal vibrations of the atoms on the image formation. The conditions for incoherent imaging are discussed. In this case the Fourier transforms of the intensities at the exit plane of the object and at the image plane are linearly related with each other. The corresponding transfer function coincides with the modulation transfer function for incoherent imaging in TEM. By analysing the properties of the degree of coherence, the reasons for the suppression of the interference terms are shown and detector arrangements are found which yield largely incoherent images. The validity of the semianalytical results for thin objects are also confirmed numerically for thick objects by means of a modified multislice algorithm. With increasing object thickness the phonon scattered electrons dominate the image intensity. Detector arrangements were found for which the elastic part of the image shows contrast reversal. The dependence of the Z-contrast on the geometry of the annular detector and on the atomic number Z is investigated in detail.},

  abstract = {If we take a curve representing a simple harmonic function of the time, and superpose on the ordinates small random errors, the only effect is to make the graph somewhat irregular, leaving the suggestion of periodicity still quite clear to the eye. Figure 10. 1 (a) shows such a curve, the random errors having been determined by the throws of dice. If the errors are increased in magnitude, as in figure 10. 1(b), the graph becomes more irregular, the suggestion of periodicity more obscure, and we have only sufficiently to increase the ‘errors' to mask completely any appearance of periodicity. But, however large the errors, periodogram analysis is applicable to such a curve, and, given a sufficient number of periods, should yield a close approximation to the period and amplitude of the underlying harmonic function. When periodogram analysis is applied to data respecting any physical phenomenon in the expectation of eliciting one or more true periodicities, there is usually, as it seems to me, a tendency to start from the initial hypothesis that the periodicity or periodicities are masked solely by such more or less random superposed fluctuations – fluctuations which do not in any way disturb the steady course of the underlying periodic function or functions. It is true that the periodogram itself will indicate the truth or otherwise of the hypothesis made, but there seems no reason for assuming it to be the hypothesis most likely a priori.},

Nevertheless, the inevitable periodic jitter of electron probe in STEM along the scanning direction due to the interference of electric power supply, including grounding, can give rise to major artifacts, as evidenced by the appearance of satellite spots surrounding all main peaks in the power spectrum of the images. Here we reveal the origin of the image artifacts related to the probe jitter by mapping the image distortion component $\epsilon$xx using the GPA algorithm. The effect is verified by introducing a periodic displacement field to a STEM image simulated from a perfect crystal structure, and the calculated $\epsilon$xx maps show very good agreement with the experimental observations. Based on the quantitative analysis of the images distortion, we propose and test a feasible strategy to eliminate the effect of probe jitter from STEM images. Successful examples illustrate that the approach can help improve the accuracy in quantification of STEM images.},

Detectors with an improved modulation transfer function at high spatial frequencies allow for higher resolution in images at lower magnification, which leads to an increased effective field of view. Detectors with improved detective quantum efficiency are important for low dose applications. One way in which these performance enhancements can be achieved is through direct detection, where primary electrons are converted directly into suitable electrical signals by the detector rather than relying on an indirect electron to photon conversion before detection. In this paper we present the characterisation of detector performance for a number of different direct detection technologies, and compare these technologies to traditional indirect detectors. Overall our results show that direct detection enables a significant improvement in all aspects of detector performance.},

An accurate measure of thickness, ideally on a column-by-column basis, parameter free, and with single atom accuracy, would be of great value for many applications, such as matching to simulations. Here we propose such a quantification method for annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy by using the single electron intensity level of the detector. This method has the advantage that we can routinely quantify annular dark field images operating at both low and high beam currents, and under high dynamic range conditions, which is useful for the quantification of ultra-thin or light-element materials. To facilitate atom counting at the atomic scale we use the mean intensity in an annular dark field image averaged over a primitive cell, with no free parameters to be fitted. To illustrate the potential of our method, we demonstrate counting the number of Al (or N) atoms in a wurtzite-type aluminum nitride single crystal at each primitive cell over the range of 3-99 atoms. {\textcopyright} Microscopy Society of America 2014.},

Recently, multi-frame acquisition approaches combined with post-processing have demonstrated significant improvements in strain precision, but the optimum number of frames to record has not been explored. Here we use a non-rigid image registration procedure before applying established strain mapping methods. We determine how, for a fixed total electron-budget, the available dose should be fractionated for maximum strain mapping precision. We find that reductions in scanning-artefacts of more than 70{\%} are achievable with image series of 20–30 frames in length. For our setup, series longer than 30 frames showed little further improvement. As an application, the strain field around an aluminium alloy precipitate was studied, from which our optimised approach yields data whos strain accuracy is verified using density functional theory.},

References 26During the past decade charge-coupled device (CCD) detectors have increasingly become the preferred choice of medium for recording data in the electron microscope. The CCD detector itself can be likened to a new type of television camera with superior properties, which makes it an ideal detector for recording very low exposure images. The success of CCD detectors for electron microscopy, however, also relies on a number of other factors, which include its fast response, low noise electronics, the ease of interfacing them to the electron microscope, and the improvements in computing that have made possible the storage and processing of large images. CCD detectors have already begun to be routinely used in a number of important biological applications such as tomography of cellular organelles (reviewed by Baumeister, 1999), where the resolution requirements are relatively modest. However, in most high- resolution microscopic applications, especially where the goal of the microscopy is to obtain structural information at near-atomic resolution, photographic film has continued to remain the medium of choice. With the increasing interest and demand for high-throughput structure determination of important macromolecular assemblies, it is clearly important to have tools for electronic data collection that bypass the slow and tedious process of processing images recorded on photographic film. In this review, we present an analysis of the potential of CCD-based detectors to fully replace photographic film for high-resolution electron crystallographic applications.},

However, a more detailed analysis shows that the activation energy for the dark current changes in the temperature range investigated. This transition can be explained by the larger relative importance at high temperatures of the diffusion dark current and at low temperatures by the depletion dark current. The diffusion dark current, characterized by the band gap of silicon, is uniform for all pixels. At low temperatures, the depletion dark current, characterized by half the band gap, prevails, but it varies for different pixels. Dark current spikes are pronounced at low temperatures and can be explained by large concentrations of deep level impurities in those particular pixels. We show that fitting the data with the impurity concentration as the only variable can explain the dark current characteristics of all the pixels on the chip.},

It has been established that for this instrument (if equipped with a thin YAG scintillator) 20{\%} of the true intensity is recorded at the highest detectable spatial frequency (Nyquist frequency), limited mostly by the modulation transfer function of the YAG scintillator. The detection quantum efficiency is 0. 45 for single 100-kV electrons and 0. 15 for single 400-kV electrons, and is approaching unity for intensities higher than ten electrons. Furthermore, nonlinearity of the response is smaller than deviations in the image intensity due to shot noise. Examples are presented illustrating the detection properties of slow-scan CCD cameras for electron imaging, which also include high dynamic range and negligible geometric distortion.},

The histogram has only positive values, and is positively skewed (with a long tail). The Normal distribution is symmetric (and possesses negative values), while the Poisson distribution is discrete. Image sensor characterization and simulation would benefit from a different distribution function, which matches the experimental observations better. Dark current fixed pattern noise is caused by discrete randomly-distributed charge generation centers. If these centers shared a common charge-generation rate, and were distributed uniformly, the Poisson distribution would result. The fact that it does not indicates that the generation rates vary, a spatially non-uniform amplification is applied to the centers, or that the spatial distribution of centers is non-uniform. Monte Carlo simulations have been used to examine these hypotheses. The Log-Normal, Gamma and Inverse Gamma distributions have been evaluated as empirical models for characterization and simulation. These models can accurately match the histograms of specific image sensors. They can also be used to synthesize the dark current images required in the development of image processing algorithms. Simulation methods can be used to create synthetic images with more complicated distributions.},

  abstract        = {Charge-coupled devices (CCD) are nowadays commonly utilized in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for applications in life sciences. Direct access to digitized images has revolutionized the use of electron microscopy, sparking developments such as automated collection of tomographic data, focal series, random conical tilt pairs and ultralarge single-particle data sets. Nevertheless, for ultrahigh-resolution work photographic plates are often still preferred. In the ideal case, the quality of the recorded image of a vitrified biological sample would solely be determined by the counting statistics of the limited electron dose the sample can withstand before beam-induced alterations dominate. Unfortunately, the image is degraded by the non-ideal point-spread function of the detector, as a result of a scintillator coupled by fibre optics to a CCD, and the addition of several inherent noise components. Different detector manufacturers provide different types of figures of merit when advertising the quality of their detector. It is hard for most laboratories to verify whether all of the anticipated specifications are met. In this report, a set of algorithms is presented to characterize on-axis slow-scan large-area CCD-based TEM detectors. These tools have been added to a publicly available image-processing toolbox for MATLAB. Three in-house CCD cameras were carefully characterized, yielding, among others, statistics for hot and bad pixels, the modulation transfer function, the conversion factor, the effective gain and the detective quantum efficiency. These statistics will aid data-collection strategy programs and provide prior information for quantitative imaging. The relative performance of the characterized detectors is discussed and a comparison is made with similar detectors that are used in the field of X-ray crystallography. {\textcopyright} {\textcopyright} 2010 International Union of Crystallography Printed in Singapore - all rights reserved.},

The distribution describing the probability that intensity values are generated by atomic columns containing a specific number of atoms is inferred on the basis of the experimental scattered intensities. Finally, the number of atoms per atom column is quantified using this estimated probability distribution. The number of atom columns available in the observed STEM image, the number of components in the estimated probability distribution, the width of the components of the probability distribution, and the typical shape of a criterion to assess the number of components in the probability distribution directly affect the accuracy and precision with which the number of atoms in a particular atom column can be estimated.

This sample allowed for the study of the intensities of a wide range of atomic numbers.

Sample thicknesses ranging from ∼10 nm to more than 400 nm were investigated. The image contrast was relatively insensitive to changes in inner angle. The main impact of sample thickness was a rapid increase in a background intensity that contributed equally to the intensities of the atomic columns and the channels between them. The background intensity and its increase with thickness reflected the average atomic number of the crystal. Subtraction of the background intensity allowed for a quantitative interpretation of image contrast in terms of atomic numbers and comparison with multislice image simulations.

The method is based on a quantification of the total intensity of the scattered electrons for the individual atomic columns using statistical parameter estimation theory. In order to apply this theory, a model is required describing the image contrast of the HAADF STEM images. Therefore, a simple, effective incoherent model has been assumed which takes the probe intensity profile into account. The scattered intensities can then be estimated by fitting this model to an experimental HAADF STEM image. These estimates are used as a performance measure to distinguish between different atomic column types and to identify the nature of unknown columns with good accuracy and precision using statistical hypothesis testing. The reliability of the method is supported by means of simulated HAADF STEM images as well as a combination of experimental images and electron energy-loss spectra. It is experimentally shown that statistically meaningful information on the composition of individual columns can be obtained even if the difference in averaged atomic number Z is only 3. Using this method, quantitative mapping at atomic resolution using HAADF STEM images only has become possible without the need of simultaneously recorded electron energy loss spectra. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.

  abstract        = {A hybrid statistics-simulations based method for atom-counting from annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF STEM) images of monotype crystalline nanostructures is presented. Different atom-counting methods already exist for model-like systems. However, the increasing relevance of radiation damage in the study of nanostructures demands a method that allows atom-counting from low dose images with a low signal-to-noise ratio. Therefore, the hybrid method directly includes prior knowledge from image simulations into the existing statistics-based method for atom-counting, and accounts in this manner for possible discrepancies between actual and simulated experimental conditions. It is shown by means of simulations and experiments that this hybrid method outperforms the statistics-based method, especially for low electron doses and small nanoparticles. The analysis of a simulated low dose image of a small nanoparticle suggests that this method allows for far more reliable quantitative analysis of beam-sensitive materials.},

We have demonstrated, in good agreement with experimental intensities obtained in calibrated samples, that normalized integrated intensities show a low dependence on the sample thickness over a wide range of thickness values.

However, technologically important nanostructures often consist of more than one chemical element. In order to extend atom counting to heterogeneous materials, a new atomic lensing model is presented. This model takes dynamical electron diffraction into account and opens up new possibilities for unraveling the 3D composition at the atomic scale.

To develop this family of models, we use a combination of training-aware neural architecture search and scaling, to jointly optimize training speed and parameter efficiency. The models were searched from the search space enriched with new ops such as Fused-MBConv. Our experiments show that EfficientNetV2 models train much faster than state-of-the-art models while being up to 6. 8x smaller. Our training can be further sped up by progressively increasing the image size during training, but it often causes a drop in accuracy. To compensate for this accuracy drop, we propose to adaptively adjust regularization (e. g. , dropout and data augmentation) as well, such that we can achieve both fast training and good accuracy. With progressive learning, our EfficientNetV2 significantly outperforms previous models on ImageNet and CIFAR/Cars/Flowers datasets. By pretraining on the same ImageNet21k, our EfficientNetV2 achieves 87. 3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet ILSVRC2012, outperforming the recent ViT by 2. 0% accuracy while training 5x-11x faster using the same computing resources.

benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on
a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method
still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of
thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language
task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which
current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up
language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes
even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning
approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with
175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model,
and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is
applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot
demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3
achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation,
question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require
on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a
novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time,
we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles,
as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to
training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples
of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from
articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding
and of GPT-3 in general.},

Here we leverage a deep learning framework that approximates visual behaviors supported by the VVS (i. e. , lacking PRC). We first apply this approach retroactively, modeling 30 published visual discrimination experiments: excluding non-diagnostic stimulus sets, there is a striking correspondence between VVS-modeled and PRC-lesioned behavior, while each is outperformed by PRC-intact participants. We corroborate and extend these results with a novel experiment, directly comparing PRC-intact human performance to electrophysiological recordings from the macaque VVS: PRC-intact participants outperform a linear readout of high-level visual cortex. By situating lesion, electrophysiological, and behavioral results within a shared computational framework, this work resolves decades of seemingly inconsistent findings surrounding PRC involvement in perception.},

Furthermore, direct numerical approximation is usually computationally intensive, requiring significant computational resources and expertise. While deep learning (DL) provides novel alternatives for efficiently recognizing complex patterns and emulating nonlinear dynamics, its predictions do not necessarily obey the governing laws of physical systems, nor do they generalize well across different systems. Thus, the study of physics-guided DL emerged and has gained great progress. Physics-guided DL aims to take the best from both physics-based modeling and state-of-the-art DL models to better solve scientific problems. In this paper, we provide a structured overview of existing methodologies of integrating prior physical knowledge or physics-based modeling into DL, with a special emphasis on learning dynamical systems.

Currently, the most successful and widely-used activation function is the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU). Although various hand-designed alternatives to ReLU have been proposed, none have managed to replace it due to inconsistent gains. In this work, we propose to leverage automatic search techniques to discover new activation functions. Using a combination of exhaustive and reinforcement learning-based search, we discover multiple novel activation functions. We verify the effectiveness of the searches by conducting an empirical evaluation with the best discovered activation function. Our experiments show that the best discovered activation function, f(x) = x {\textperiodcentered} sigmoid($\beta$x), which we name Swish, tends to work better than ReLU on deeper models across a number of challenging datasets. For example, simply replacing ReLUs with Swish units improves top-1 classification accuracy on ImageNet by 0. 9% for Mobile NASNet-A and 0. 6% for Inception-ResNet-v2. The simplicity of Swish and its similarity to ReLU make it easy for practitioners to replace ReLUs with Swish units in any neural network.},

  abstract  = {The Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm, first published in 1965, is an enormously popular direct search method for multidimensional unconstrained minimization. Despite its widespread use essentially no theoretical results have been proved explicitly for the Nelder-Mead algorithm. This paper presents convergence properties of the Nelder-Mead algorithm applied to strictly convex functions in dimensions 1 and 2. We prove convergence to a minimizer for dimension 1, and various limited convergence results for dimension 2. A counterexample of McKinnon gives a family of strictly convex functions in two dimensions and a set of initial conditions for which the Nelder-Mead algorithm converges to a nonminimizer. It is not yet known whether the Nelder-Mead method can be proved to converge to a minimizer for a more specialized class of convex functions in two dimensions.},

  abstract  = {In the present paper, the principles of detection theory are used to quantify the probability of error for atom-counting from high resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR STEM) images. Binary and multiple hypothesis testing have been investigated in order to determine the limits to the precision with which the number of atoms in a projected atomic column can be estimated. The probability of error has been calculated when using STEM images, scattering cross-sections or peak intensities as a criterion to count atoms. Based on this analysis, we conclude that scattering cross-sections perform almost equally well as images and perform better than peak intensities. Furthermore, the optimal STEM detector design can be derived for atom-counting using the expression for the probability of error. We show that for very thin objects LAADF is optimal and that for thicker objects the optimal inner detector angle increases.},

In scanning transmission electron microscopy, low-dose imaging can be realized by very fast scanning, however, this also introduces artifacts and a loss of resolution in the scan direction. We have developed a software approach to correct for artifacts introduced by fast scans, making use of a scintillator and photomultiplier response that extends over several pixels. The parameters for this correction can be directly extracted from the raw image. Finally, the images can be converted into electron counts. This approach enables low-dose imaging in the scanning transmission electron microscope via high scan speeds while retaining the image quality of artifact-free slower scans.},

Although various alternatives to ReLU have been proposed, none have managed to
replace it due to inconsistent gains. In this work, we propose a new activation
function, named Swish, which is simply $f(x) = x \cdot \text\{sigmoid\}(x)$. Our
experiments show that Swish tends to work better than ReLU on deeper models
across a number of challenging datasets. For example, simply replacing ReLUs
with Swish units improves top-1 classification accuracy on ImageNet by 0. 9\% for
Mobile NASNet-A and 0. 6\% for Inception-ResNet-v2. The simplicity of Swish and
its similarity to ReLU make it easy for practitioners to replace ReLUs with
Swish units in any neural network.},

Deep convolutional neural networks have shown great potential for highly variable tasks across many image-based domains, but sometimes can be challenging to train due to their internal non-linearity. We propose a novel, fast-converging neural network architecture capable of solving generic image(s)-to-image(s) inverse problems relevant to a diverse set of domains. We show this approach is useful in recovering wavefronts from direct intensity measurements, imaging objects from diffusely reflected images, and denoising scanning transmission electron microscopy images, just by using different training datasets. These successful applications demonstrate the proposed network to be an ideal candidate solving general inverse problems falling into the category of image(s)-to-image(s) translation.},

It is hereby important to perform such analyses under conditions relevant for the envisioned application. Here, the 3D structure of supported Au NPs at high temperature, which is of importance to understand their behavior during catalytic reactions, is investigated. To overcome limitations related to conventional high-resolution electron tomography at high temperature, 3D characterization of NPs with atomic resolution has been performed by applying atom-counting using atomic resolution annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF STEM) images followed by structural relaxation. However, at high temperatures, thermal displacements, which affect the ADF STEM intensities, should be taken into account. Moreover, it is very likely that the structure of an NP investigated at elevated temperature deviates from a ground state configuration, which is difficult to determine using purely computational energy minimization approaches. In this paper, an optimized approach is therefore proposed using an iterative local minima search algorithm followed by molecular dynamics structural relaxation of candidate structures associated with each local minimum. In this manner, it becomes possible to investigate the 3D atomic structure of supported NPs, which may deviate from their ground state configuration.},

  abstract  = {When characterizing beam-sensitive materials in the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM), low-dose techniques are essential for the reliable observation of samples in their true state. A simple route to minimize both the total electron-dose and the dose-rate is to reduce the electron beam-current and/or raster the probe at higher speeds. At the limit of these settings, and with current detectors, the resulting images suffer from unacceptable artifacts, including signal-streaking, detector-afterglow, and poor signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). In this article, we present an alternative approach to capture dark-field STEM images by pulse-counting individual electrons as they are scattered to the annular dark-field (ADF) detector. Digital images formed in this way are immune from analog artifacts of streaking or afterglow and allow clean, high-SNR images to be obtained even at low beam-currents. We present results from both a ThermoFisher FEI Titan G2 operated at 300 kV and a Nion UltraSTEM200 operated at 200 kV, and compare the images to conventional analog recordings. ADF data are compared with analog counterparts for each instrument, a digital detector-response scan is performed on the Titan, and the overall rastering efficiency is evaluated for various scanning parameters.},

  abstract = {We propose a novel image denoising strategy based on an enhanced sparse representation in transform domain. The enhancement of the sparsity is achieved by grouping similar 2-D image fragments (e.g., blocks) into 3-D data arrays which we call "groups."Collaborative filtering is a special procedure developed to deal with these 3-D groups. We realize it using the three successive steps: 3-D transformation of a group, shrinkage of the transform spectrum, and inverse 3-D transformation. The result is a 3-D estimate that consists of the jointly filtered grouped image blocks. By attenuating the noise, the collaborative filtering reveals even the finest details shared by grouped blocks and, at the same time, it preserves the essential unique features of each individual block. The filtered blocks are then returned to their original positions. Because these blocks are overlapping, for each pixel, we obtain many different estimates which need to be combined. Aggregation is a particular averaging procedure which is exploited to take advantage of this redundancy. A significant improvement is obtained by a specially developed collaborative Wiener filtering. An algorithm based on this novel denoising strategy and its efficient implementation are presented in full detail; an extension to color-image denoising is also developed. The experimental results demonstrate that this computationally scalable algorithm achieves state-of-the-art denoising performance in terms of both peak signal-to-noise ratio and subjective visual quality. © 2007 IEEE.},

The only assumption is that the inputs are acquired with identical experimental configurations. To evaluate the restoration performance of our model, as it is impossible to obtain ground truth for our experimental dataset, we propose consecutive structural similarity (CSS) for image quality assessment, based on the fact that the structures remain much the same as the previous frame(s) within small scan intervals.

  abstract  = {Large, carefully partitioned datasets are essential to train neural networks and standardize performance benchmarks. As a result, we have set up new repositories to make our electron microscopy datasets available to the wider community. There are three main datasets containing 19769 scanning transmission electron micrographs, 17266 transmission electron micrographs, and 98340 simulated exit wavefunctions, and multiple variants of each dataset for different applications. To visualize image datasets, we trained variational autoencoders to encode data as 64-dimensional multivariate normal distributions, which we cluster in two dimensions by t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding. In addition, we have improved dataset visualization with variational autoencoders by introducing encoding normalization and regularization, adding an image gradient loss, and extending t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding to account for encoded standard deviations.},

  abstract = {Superconducting materials enable lossless current transport, bringing them into focus for technical applications. Particularly relevant are epitaxially grown thin films of high-temperature superconductors, like the Fe- and Cu-based materials Ba(Fe\$\_\{0.92\}\$Co\$\_\{0.08\}\$)\$\_\{2\}\$As\$\_\{2\}\$ (Ba122) and REBa\$\_\{2\}\$Cu\$\_\{3\}\$O\$\_\{7-{$\delta\rbrace\$$} (REBCO, with rare-earth elements, REs, such as Y, Sm, Gd, ..., and the O non-stoichiometry {$\delta$}). A central goal of current research is to improve the current-carrying capacity of superconducting thin films for improved coated-conductor technology. Non-superconducting defects of suitable shape and size (typically a few nanometers) play an essential role in superconductivity, as they prevent the unwanted movement of magnetic flux lines (``flux pinning''). However, the controlled fabrication of such defects is difficult since several fabrication parameters influence defect formation. In this work, scanning (transmission) electron microscopy (S(T)EM) in combination with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) was applied for a better understanding of the film growth and defect formation.\vphantom\}},

@article{Chew1985,
   abstract = {We present an "expanding waves" view of Voronoi diagrams that allows such diagrams to be defined for very general metrics and for distance measures that do not qualify as metrics. If a pebble is dropped into a still pond, circular waves move out from the point of Impact. If n pebbles are dropped simultaneously, the places where wave fronts meet define the Voronoi diagram op the n points of Impact. The Voronoi diagram for any normed metric, including the L metrics, can be obtained by P changing the shape of the wave front from a circleto the shape of the " circle " in that metric. (For example, the " circle " in the L^ metric is diamond shaped.) For any convex wave shape there is a corresponding convex distance function. If the shape is not symmetrle about i t s center (a triangle, for example) then the resulting distance function is not a metric, although it canstill be used to define a Voronoi diagram. Like Voronoi diagrams based on the Euclidean metric, the Voronoi diagrams based on other normed metrics can be used to solve various closest-point problems (all-nearest-neighbors, minimum spanning trees, etc.). Some of these problems also make sense under convex distance functions which are not metrics. In particular, the "largest empty circle " problem becomes the "largest empty convex shape" problem, and "motion planning for a disc" becomes "motion planning for a convex shape". These problems can both be solved quickly given the Voronoi diagram. Vie present an asymptotically optimal algorithm for computing Voronoi diagrams based on convex distance functions.},

@article{Kaiser2023,
   abstract = {High-resolution electron microscopy is achievable only when a high electron dose is employed, a practice that may cause damage to the specimen and, in general, affects the observation. This drawback sets some limitations on the range of applications of high-resolution electron microscopy. Our work proposes a strategy, based on machine learning, which enables a significant improvement in the quality of Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope images generated at low electron dose, strongly affected by Poisson noise. In particular, we develop an autoencoder, trained on a large database of images, which is thoroughly tested on both synthetic and actual microscopy data. The algorithm is demonstrated to drastically reduce the noise level and approach ground-truth precision over a broad range of electron beam intensities. Importantly, it does not require human data pre-processing or the explicit knowledge of the dose level employed and can run at a speed compatible with live data acquisition. Furthermore, a quantitative unbiased benchmarking protocol is proposed to compare different denoising workflows.},

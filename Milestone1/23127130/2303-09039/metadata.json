    "abstract": "The hot nucleus $^{162}\\mathrm{Dy}$ is investigated using covariant density functional theory, where the shell-model-like approach treats the pairing correlation. Lee-Yang's theorem is applied to classify the pairing phase transition by analyzing the distribution of zeros of the partition function in the complex temperature plane. The distribution of zeros of the partition function converges with increasing particle numbers and illustrates the characteristics of the phase transition. In our calculations, we determine the first order of the phase transition near the critical temperature. Different seniority states show the pairing phase transition from a superfluid to a normal phase, ranging from fully paired states to completely unpaired states.",

  abstract = {Using the relativistic Hartree–Fock Lagrangian PKA1, we investigate the properties of the exotic nucleus 48Si, which is predicted to be an atypical nucleus characterized by i) the onset of doubly magicity, ii) its location at the drip line, iii) the presence of dual semi-bubble structure (distinct central depletion in both of neutron and proton density profiles) in the ground state, and iv) the occurrence of pairing reentrance at finite temperature. While not being new for each, these phenomena are found to simultaneously occur in 48Si. For instance, the dual semi-bubble structure reduces the spin–orbit splitting of low-ℓ orbitals and upraises the s orbitals, leading therefore to distinct N=34 and Z=14 magic shells in 48Si. Consequently, the doubly magicities provide extra stability for such extreme neutron-rich system at the drip line. Associating with the neutron shell N=34 and continuum above, the pairing correlations are reengaged interestingly at finite temperature. Theoretical nuclear modelings are known to be poorly predictive in general, and we asset our confidence in the prediction of our modeling on the fact that the predictions of PKA1 in various regions of the nuclear chart have systematically been found correct and more specifically in the region of pf shell. Whether our predictions are confirmed or not, 48Si provides a concrete benchmark for the understanding of the nature of nuclear force.},

  abstract  = {The first classification of general types of transition between phases of matter, introduced by Paul Ehrenfest in 1933, lies at a crossroads in the thermodynamical study of critical phenomena. It arose following the discovery in 1932 of a suprising new phase transition in liquid helium, the "lambda transition," when W. H. Keesom and coworkers in Leiden, Holland observed a λ-shaped "jump" discontinuity in the curve giving the temperature dependence of the specific heat of helium at a critical value. This apparent jump led Ehrenfest to introduce a classification of phase transitions on the basis of jumps in derivatives of the free energy function. This classification was immediately applied by A. J. Rutgers to the study of the transition from the normal to superconducting state in metals. Eduard Justi and Max von Laue soon questioned the possibility of its class of "second-order phase transitions" - of which the "lambda transition was believed to be the arche type - but CJ. Goiter and H. B. G. Casimir used an "order parameter to demonstrate their existence in superconductors. As a crossroads of study, the Ehrenfest classification was forced to undergo a slow, adaptive evolution during subsequent decades. During the 1940' s the classification was increasingly used in discussions of liquid-gas, order-disorder, paramagnetic-ferromagnetic and normalsuper-conducting phase transitions. Already in 1944 however, Lars Onsager's solution of the Ising model for two-dimensional magnets was seen to possess a derivative with a logarithmic divergence rather than a jump as the critical point was approached. In the 1950' s, experiments further revealed the lambda transition in helium to exhibit similar behavior. Rather than being a prime example of an Ehrenfest phase transition, the lambda transition was seen to lie outside the Ehrenfest classification. The Ehrenfest scheme was then extended to include such singularities, most notably by A. Brain Pippard in 1957, with widespread acceptance. During the 1960' s these logarithmic infinities were the focus of the investigation of "scaling" by Leo Kadanoff, B. Widom and others. By the 1970s, a radically simplified binary classification of phase transitions into "first-order" and "continuous" transitions was increasingly adopted.},

  abstract = {A particle-number-conserving (PNC) method for treating the nuclear pairing correlation is presented. The difficulties encountered in the BCS method (particle-number nonconservation, spurious states, blocking effect and orthogonality, etc.) disappear in the PNC treatment. A detailed comparison between the BCS and PNC methods is made. It is found that the shape and the state density of the low-lying spectra obtained are quite different from those of the quasiparticle spectra obtained in the BCS method. Large differences between the two methods are found in the occupation probabilities in the excited states, the branching ratios for two-particle transfer reactions, etc. Blocking effects in the energy and the moment of inertia are analyzed. The residual quasiparticle interaction and the relation between the even-odd mass difference and quasiparticle energy are investigated. Pair vibration and pair rotation are investigated in the framework of the PNC formalism.},

Moreover, attempts to build a microscopic and universal density functional are also discussed in terms of the successful fully self-consistent relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock calculations.},

We investigate the competition between shape deformations and pairing correlations as a function of temperature. We find that shape and pairing changes contribute to the specific heat of the nucleus in a different way. While the superfluid-to-normal transition manifests itself as a pronounced peak in the specific heat around T=0.6–0.7 MeV, the deformed-to-spherical transition is more gradual.},

This can be interpreted in terms of a nearly 1st order phase transition from a superfluid to an ideal gas of quasi particles.

This converging evidence supports the relevance of the BCS theory to atomic nuclei.},

We show that systems with as few as ∼ 10 – 16 fermions can exhibit clear features reminiscent of a phase transition.},

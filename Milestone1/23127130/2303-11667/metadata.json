    "abstract": "$γ$-GeSe is a new type of layered bulk material that was recently successfully synthesized. By means of density functional theory first-principles calculations, we systematically studied the physical properties of two dimensional (2D) few-layer $γ$-GeSe. It is found that few-layer $γ$-GeSe are semiconductors with band gaps decreasing with increasing layer number; and 2D $γ$-GeSe with layer number n ${\\ge}$ 2 are ferroelectric with rather low transition barriers, consistent with the sliding ferroelectric mechanism. Particularly, Zeeman-type spin splitting is observed at the top of valence band, which can be switched by the ferroelectric reversal; furthermore, their negative piezoelectricity also enables the regulation of spin splitting by strain. Finally, high carrier mobility and excellent optical absorption were also revealed. These intriguing properties make 2D few-layer $γ$-GeSe be promising in spintronic and optoelectric applications.",

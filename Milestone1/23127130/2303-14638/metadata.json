    "abstract": "Any interacting system can be studied as a network where nodes are units and edges denote correlated interactions. As internal correlations increase, correlated behaviours emerge and propagate among units to create percolation phenomena. In this work, we propose a unified framework to study the informational and thermodynamic aspects of percolation in interacting systems, which enables us to analytically measure freedom degree loss during percolation and analyze the underlying thermodynamic evolution. We apply this framework to analyze the critical exponents and scaling relations (e.g., the Rushbrooke inequality) of the Bernoulli percolation, the bootstrap percolation, and the synchronization described by the Kuramoto model. These results suggest the general applicability of our framework in analyzing the universality of diverse phase transition phenomena.",

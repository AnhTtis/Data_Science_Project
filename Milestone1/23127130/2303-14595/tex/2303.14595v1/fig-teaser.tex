    Feature distribution before and after training on a task in a class incremental learning experiment on MNIST, visualized by t-SNE. 
    \textbf{Left}: before training on task 2, seen classes (1,2) are learned to be separable along the horizontal axis for classification, while unseen classes (3, 4) are not separable. \textbf{Right}: after training on task 2, the new vertical axis is learned to separate new classes (3,4). 
    Based on this observation, we propose the Backward Feature Projection loss $L_{BFP}$, which allows new feature dimensions to emerge to separate new classes in feature space and also preserves the linear separability of old classes to reduce catastrophic forgetting.

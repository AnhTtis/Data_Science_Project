\begin{abstract}
The production cross section of inclusive $\Jpsi$ pairs in \pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy \thirteen is measured with ALICE. The measurement is performed for $\Jpsi$ in the rapidity interval $2.5<y<4.0$ and for transverse momentum $\pt>0$. 
The production cross section of inclusive $\Jpsi$ pairs is reported to be $10.3 \pm 2.3 \, {\rm (stat.)} \pm 1.3 \, {\rm (syst.)}$~nb in this kinematic interval. 
The contribution from non-prompt $\Jpsi$ (i.e.\ originated from beauty-hadron decays) to the inclusive sample is evaluated. 
The results are discussed and compared with data.

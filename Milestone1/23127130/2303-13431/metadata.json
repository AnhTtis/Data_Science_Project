    "abstract": "The production cross section of inclusive J/$ψ$ pairs in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy $\\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV is measured with ALICE. The measurement is performed for J/$ψ$ in the rapidity interval $2.5 < y < 4.0$ and for transverse momentum $p_{\\rm T} > 0$. The production cross section of inclusive J/$ψ$ pairs is reported to be $10.3 \\pm 2.3 {\\rm (stat.)} \\pm 1.3 {\\rm (syst.)}$ nb in this kinematic interval. The contribution from non-prompt J/$ψ$ (i.e. originated from beauty-hadron decays) to the inclusive sample is evaluated. The effective double-parton scattering cross section is computed, neglecting the single-parton scattering contribution.",

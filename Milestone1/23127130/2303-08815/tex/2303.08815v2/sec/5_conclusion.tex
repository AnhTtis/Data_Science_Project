\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we present an online lane graph construction method LaneGAP based on novel path-wise modeling. We qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate the superiority of LaneGAP over pixel-based and piece-based methods. 
% It's our belief that modeling lane graph in the path level is  reasonable and promising. 
LaneGAP  can serve as a fundamental module of the self-driving 
system and facilitate downstream motion prediction and planning, which we leave as future work.

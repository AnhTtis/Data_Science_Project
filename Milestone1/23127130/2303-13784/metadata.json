    "abstract": "A multi-channel quantum router with four nodal cavities is constructed by two coupled-resonator waveguides and four single cavities. We can achieve directional routing by adjusting the probability of photon exiting from the specified port to close to 100$\\%$. There are multiple pathways between the photon from the incident port to the outgoing port in this hybrid system. Under the effect of phase difference between two classical light fields, the mutual interference between different pathways can be adjusted to destructive interference or constructive interference, which lays the foundation for the increase and decrease of the routing probability. The influence of different parameter values on single photon routing probability is also studied. By studying the analytic formula of probability amplitude, we get the physical mechanism of exiting ports being closed under certain parameter conditions.",

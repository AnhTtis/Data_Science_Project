journal = {Quantum Science and Technology},
abstract = {We propose a potentially practical scheme for the controllable single-photon transport via waveguides which are coupled to a microcavity–emitter system. The microcavity–emitter system consists of a V-type three-level emitter and two or one single-mode microcavity. A driving field is used to drive a hyperfine transition between two upper excited states of the V-type three-level emitter. Beyond chiral coupling between waveguides and microcavity–emitter system, we show that the perfectly nonreciprocal single-photon transport in a single waveguide and the single-photon router with 100% routing probability in two waveguides can be achieved. Interesting enough, whether the nonreciprocal single-photon transport or the single-photon router can be switched periodically by adjusting the phase associated with microcavity–emitter coupling strength and the driving field. The complete physical explanation of the underlying mechanism is presented.}

 abstract={We propose a scheme for realizing high-fidelity topological state transfer via the topological edge states in a one-dimensional cavity-magnon system. We find that the cavity-magnon system can be mapped analytically into the generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with tunable cavity-magnon coupling. It can be shown that the edge state can be served as a quantum channel to realize the photonic and magnonic state transfers by adjusting the coupling strength between adjacent cavity modes. Further, our scheme can realize the quantum state transfer between photonic state and magnonic state by changing the cavity-magnon coupling strength. With the numerical simulation, we quantitatively show that the photonic, magnonic and magnon-to-photon state transfers can be achieved with high fidelity in the cavity-magnon system. Spectacularly, three different types of quantum state transfer schemes can be even transformed into each other in a controllable fashion. The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model based on the cavity-magnon system provides us a tunable platform to engineer the transport of photon and magnon, which may have potential applications in topological quantum processing.}

abstract = {An extended Su–Schrieffer–Heeger (SSH) model containing four periods of the hopping coefficients, called SSH4 model, is constructed to explore robust quantum state transfer. The gap state protected by the energy gap plays the role of the topological channel where the particle initially located at the last lattice site has the probability to arise at the first and all even lattice sites equally. Serving those sites as ports, a multi-port router can be realized naturally, and the fidelity reaches unity in a wide range of parameters under the long chain and random disorder. Further, when we reduce the third intracell hopping to a small value, the occupancy probability of the second lattice site in every unit cell will reduce to zero, by which a new topological router can be induced. In addition, our SSH4 model can work as a 1/3 beam splitter. Namely, the particle initially occupies the first lattice site and finally appears with equal probability at three lattice sites. We can also realize a 1/2 beam splitter. Our four-period SSH model provides a novel way for topological quantum information processing and can engineer two kinds of quantum optical devices.}

It is shown that when the Rydberg interaction is in the proper range, three kinds of photons with different frequencies are absorbed and the quantum routing can be achieved due to the spontaneous emission of the formed dressed states.  The Rydberg interaction can also cause photons that are not originally in the energy range to be routed. Furthermore, the total reflection of the single photon is obtained because of the coherent resonance and the existence of the photonic bound states. Based on these characteristics, it is a feasible scheme to generate a multi-frequency photons router and it could be useful for designing the single-photon devices.},

We proposed an efficient scheme for realizing quantum routers via multiple semi-infinite coupled-resonator waveguides (CRWs) coupled to cavities nonreciprocally. Numerical results show that with the change of the phase difference value, the quantum routing function of multiple output ports can be realized, in the meantime, the information conversion rate can almost reach 100{\%}. The optimal conditions for these phenomena are obtained by the time-reversal symmetry breaking the nonreciprocal of the single-photon transport. Moreover, we have also described a scalable scheme that can extend the router to an arbitrary number of outputs. Our results pave the way to design high-quality quantum devices based on breaking time-reversal symmetry waveguide-cavity systems.},

abstract = {Single particles of light, photons, are ideal carriers of quantum information because they can travel far and fast and don't interact much with each other. However, this behavior has hampered attempts to control the propagation of single photons using all-optical setups. Shomroni et al. coupled a trapped atom to an optic fiber. That allowed them to control the polarization and propagation direction of a single photon in the fiber by controlling the atom's state (see the Perspective by Rempe). Because a faint pulse containing between 1.5 and 3 photons can switch the atom's state, the scheme provides a route to develop all-optical quantum networks. Science, this issue p. 903; see also p. 871 An all-optical scheme for routing single photons by single photons is demonstrated. [Also see Perspective by Rempe] The prospect of quantum networks, in which quantum information is carried by single photons in photonic circuits, has long been the driving force behind the effort to achieve all-optical routing of single photons. We realized a single-photon–activated switch capable of routing a photon from any of its two inputs to any of its two outputs. Our device is based on a single atom coupled to a fiber-coupled, chip-based microresonator. A single reflected control photon toggles the switch from high reflection (R ~ 65\%) to high transmission (T ~ 90\%), with an average of ~1.5 control photons per switching event (~3, including linear losses). No additional control fields are required. The control and target photons are both in-fiber and practically identical, making this scheme compatible with scalable architectures for quantum information processing.}}

Although the quantum routing of signals has been investigated for various systems, both in theory and experiment, the general form of a quantum router with multi-output terminals still needs to be explored. Here, we propose an experimentally accessible tunable single-photon multi-channel routing scheme using an optomechanics cavity which is Coulomb coupled to a nanomechanical resonator. The router can extract single photons from the coherent input signal and directly modulate them into three different output channels. More importantly, the two output signal frequencies can be selected by adjusting the Coulomb coupling strength. For application purposes, we justify that there is insignificant influence from the vacuum and thermal noises on the performance of the router under cryogenic conditions. Our proposal may pave a new avenue towards multi-channel routers and quantum networks.},

abstract = {A circulator is a passive three- or four-port device that routes signals according to a simple protocol: If the ports are numbered in ascending order, a signal that enters the circulator through port 1, 2, 3, or 4 exits it through port 2, 3, 4, or 1, respectively. Scheucher et al. demonstrate an integrated optical circulator that operates by using the internal quantum state of a single atom (see the Perspective by Munro and Nemoto). Moreover, the routing can be reversed by flipping the atomic spin. Such an integrated optical device may be important for routing and processing quantum information in scalable integrated optical circuits. Science, this issue p. 1577; see also p. 1532 The internal state of a single atom is used to route single photons in an optical circulator. Integrated nonreciprocal optical components, which have an inherent asymmetry between their forward and backward propagation direction, are key for routing signals in photonic circuits. Here, we demonstrate a fiber-integrated quantum optical circulator operated by a single atom. Its nonreciprocal behavior arises from the chiral interaction between the atom and the transversally confined light. We demonstrate that the internal quantum state of the atom controls the operation direction of the circulator and that it features a strongly nonlinear response at the single-photon level. This enables, for example, photon number–dependent routing and novel quantum simulation protocols. Furthermore, such a circulator can in principle be prepared in a coherent superposition of its operational states and may become a key element for quantum information processing in scalable integrated optical circuits.}}

Assuming various configurations, including multiple-unicast, multicast, and multiple-multicast communication, we bound the optimal rates for transmitting quantum information, distributing entanglement, or generating secret keys in quantum networks connected by arbitrary quantum channels.

In the case of chiral couplings between the waveguides and atoms, we realize a directed single-photon router and the efficiency of single-photon routing reaches 100{\%}. In addition, in this network, the photon input from one port of the channel can be fully routed to any outport of the other two channels by modulating the coupling strength of the waveguides and atoms and the frequency of the incident photon. Thus, a quantum network can be constructed based on our scheme. The influence of the ratio of chiral coupling strength on the properties of the single-photon router is also shown. We also show how the efficiency of routing is affected by system dissipation.},

Here, we show that gradient metasurface structures consisting of phased arrays of plasmonic or dielectric nanoantennas can be used to control guided waves via strong optical scattering at subwavelength intervals. Based on this design principle, we experimentally demonstrate waveguide mode converters, polarization rotators and waveguide devices supporting asymmetric optical power transmission. We also demonstrate all-dielectric on-chip polarization rotators based on phased arrays of Mie resonators with negligible insertion losses. Our gradient metasurfaces can enable small-footprint, broadband and low-loss photonic integrated devices.},

The scattering problem is solved in closed form for different level structures. Several possible applications are discussed: the state of the emitter can be switched deterministically by Raman scattering, thus enabling applications in quantum computing such as a single-photon transistor. An array of emitters gives rise to a photonic band gap structure, which can be tuned by a classical driving laser. A disordered array leads to Anderson localization of photons, where the localization length can again be controlled by an external driving.},

pages={775-779},
abstract={Models of light--matter interactions in quantum electrodynamics typically invoke the dipole approximation1,2, in which atoms are treated as point-like objects when compared to the wavelength of the electromagnetic modes with which they interact. However, when the ratio between the size of the atom and the mode wavelength is increased, the dipole approximation no longer holds and the atom is referred to as a `giant atom'2,3. So far, experimental studies with solid-state devices in the giant-atom regime have been limited to superconducting qubits that couple to short-wavelength surface acoustic waves4--10, probing the properties of the atom at only a single frequency. Here we use an alternative architecture that realizes a giant atom by coupling small atoms to a waveguide at multiple, but well separated, discrete locations. This system enables tunable atom--waveguide couplings with large on--off ratios3 and a coupling spectrum that can be engineered by the design of the device. We also demonstrate decoherence-free interactions between multiple giant atoms that are mediated by the quasi-continuous spectrum of modes in the waveguide---an effect that is not achievable using small atoms11. These features allow qubits in this architecture to switch between protected and emissive configurations in situ while retaining qubit--qubit interactions, opening up possibilities for high-fidelity quantum simulations and non-classical itinerant photon generation12,13.},

abstract={Photons rarely interact---which makes it challenging to build all-optical devices in which one light signal controls another. Even in nonlinear optical media, in which two beams can interact because of their influence on the medium's refractive index, this interaction is weak at low light levels. Here, we propose a novel approach to realizing strong nonlinear interactions at the single-photon level, by exploiting the strong coupling between individual optical emitters and propagating surface plasmons confined to a conducting nanowire. We show that this system can act as a nonlinear two-photon switch for incident photons propagating along the nanowire, which can be coherently controlled using conventional quantum-optical techniques. Furthermore, we discuss how the interaction can be tailored to create a single-photon transistor, where the presence (or absence) of a single incident photon in a `gate' field is sufficient to allow (or prevent) the propagation of subsequent `signal' photons along the wire.},

The realization of quantum networks composed of many nodes and channels requires new scientific capabilities for generating and characterizing quantum coherence and entanglement.

    "abstract": "We bound the number of global sections of a torsion-free, globally-generated sheaf in terms of its rank, degree, and invariants of the variety. As an application of this bound, we show the syzygy sheaf associated to a sufficiently positive torsion-free sheaf of rank $1$ is slope stable. Furthermore, we are able to give an explicit bound for ``sufficiently positive.\"",

    "abstract": "We verify that a large portion of the theory of complex operator spaces and operator algebras (as represented by the text [7] for specificity) transfers to the real case. We point out some of the results that do not work in the real case. We also discuss how the theory and standard constructions interact with the complexification. For example, we develop the real case of the theory of operator space multipliers and the operator space centralizer algebra, and discuss how these topics connect with the complexification. This turns out to differ in some important details from the complex case. We also characterize real structure in complex operator spaces; and give `real' characterizations of some of the most important objects in the subject.",

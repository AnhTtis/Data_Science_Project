    "abstract": "We present the quantum teleportation and superdense coding protocols in the context of topological qudits, as realised by anyons. The simplicity of our proposed realisation hinges on the monoidal structure of Tambara-Yamagami categories, which readily allows for the generation of maximally entangled qudits. In particular, we show that both protocols can be performed without any braiding of anyons. Our exposition makes use of the graphical calculus for braided fusion categories, a medium in which the protocols find a natural interpretation. We also find a braid-free realisation of the Pauli gates using Ising anyons.",

Deep learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples. Transfer-based adversarial attacks attract tremendous attention as they can identify the weaknesses of deep learning models in a black-box manner. An effective strategy to improve the transferability of adversarial examples is attacking an ensemble of models. However, previous works simply average the outputs of different models, lacking an in-depth analysis on how and why model ensemble can strongly improve the transferability. In this work, we rethink the ensemble in adversarial attacks and define the common weakness of model ensemble with the properties of the flatness of loss landscape and the closeness to the local optimum of each model. We empirically and theoretically show that these two properties are strongly correlated with the transferability and propose a Common Weakness Attack (CWA) to generate more transferable adversarial examples by promoting these two properties.
Experimental results on both image classification and object detection tasks validate the effectiveness of our approach to improve the adversarial transferability, especially when attacking adversarially trained models.

\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we rethink model ensemble in adversarial attacks. We theoretically analyze the relationship between the transferability of adversarial samples, the Hessian matrix's F-norm, and the distance between the local optimum of each model and the convergence point. We define common weaknesses based on this insight and propose effective algorithms to find common weaknesses of model ensemble. We also conduct extensive experiments on image classification and object detection to empirically show that our algorithm is good at finding common weakness, and therefore leads to better transferability of adversarial examples.

%Our algorithm is not only efficient, but also effective, especially when there are many kind of training models and when attacking the adversarially trained model, which outperforms previous methods by 30\% in average. We hope our algorithm can be applied to real scenarios as an effective and straightforward attacker.

    "abstract": "In this note, we improve Nikulin's inequality in the case of right-angled hyperbolic polyhedra. The new inequality allows to give much shorter proofs of the known dimension bounds. We also improve Nonaka's lower bound on the number of ideal vertices for right-angled hyperbolic polyhedra.",

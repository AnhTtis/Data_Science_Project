    "abstract": "In this paper, we prove that a smooth projective globally $F$-split variety with numerically flat tangent bundle is an étale quotient of an ordinary abelian variety. We also show its logarithmic analog, which contains a characterization of toric varieties. We further prove that, without assumption of global $F$-splitting, a smooth projective separably rationally connected variety of arbitrary characteristic with numerically flat log cotangent bundle is a toric variety.",

    "abstract": "We report an {\\it in-situ} scanning tunneling microscopy study of atomically thin films of CeCoIn$_5$, a $d$-wave heavy-fermion superconductor. Both hybridization and superconducting gaps are observed even in monolayer CeCoIn$_5$, providing direct evidence of superconductivity of heavy quasiparticles mediated by purely two-dimensional bosonic excitations. In these atomically thin films, $T_c$ is suppressed to nearly half of the bulk, but is similar to CeCoIn$_5$/YbCoIn$_5$ superlattices containing CeCoIn$_5$ layers with the same thickness as the thin films. Remarkably, the out-of-plane upper critical field $μ_0H_{c2\\perp}$ at zero temperature is largely enhanced from those of bulk and superlattices. The enhanced $H_{c2\\perp}$ well exceeds the Pauli and bulk orbital limits, suggesting the possible emergence of unusual superconductivity with parity mixing caused by the inversion symmetry breaking.",

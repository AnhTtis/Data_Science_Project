% Final camera ready copy (for accepted papers)
% Camera-ready submission for accepted papers will be open via CMT (https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/BMVC2021/). All papers will require one author to pay a registration fee, which we hope to be < 100 GBP per paper. This will cover the costs of hosting and streaming the conference. This will also help keep a low general registration fee, maximising participation and also dissemination. Details will be emailed directly to authors of accepted papers. One registration is required per accepted paper; that is, for any two papers at least two registrations are required irrespective of shared authorship. Papers for which we have no registered authors will be removed from the conference. For each accepted paper authors should upload:

% Final camera-ready paper (in PDF format)
% Optional supplementary materials (ZIP file up to 100MB)
% The name of your submission file must be of the form XXXX.pdf where XXXX is the four-digit paper ID (zero-padded if necessary). For example, if your paper ID is 24, the filename must be 0024.pdf. If you upload supplementary materials please name them as XXXX_supp.zip where XXXX is the four-digit paper ID (zero-padded if necessary).

% You are permitted one extra page in the camera ready copy to take into account the reviewer’s comments. This means the length of the camera ready copy should not exceed 10 pages excluding the references and any acknowledgements. All appendices must be counted within the 10 pages limit or supplied as supplementary material.

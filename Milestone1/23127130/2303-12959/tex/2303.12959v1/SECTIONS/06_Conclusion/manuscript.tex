\section{Conclusion}
We propose a novel framework with a decremental information bottleneck for disentanglement.
Hierarchical latent spaces with disentanglement-invariant transformation are the key to overcoming the problem of losing disentanglement constraint while expanding the information bottleneck.
The decremental method is compatible with high-dimensional problems and reduces the information diffusion problem.
\fix{}{
In practice, the typical disentanglement methods have to refine suitable hyperparameters for a dataset without labels by trail and error.
In contrast, DeVAE is tolerant to redundant layers such that we can set a large parameter set to fit kinds of datasets.}

\noindent\textbf{Broader Impact}
Unlike previous works that spread the conflict of the trade-off over time, our work demonstrates a novel direction to solve the trade-off by spreading the conflict in spaces.
Our work provides insights on balancing disentanglement and reconstruction.

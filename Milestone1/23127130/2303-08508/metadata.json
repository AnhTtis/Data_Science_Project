    "abstract": "The measurement of neutrino magnetic moment larger than $10^{-19}μ_B$ would be a clear signature of physics beyond the standard model other than the existence of massive Dirac neutrinos. The use of a spherical proportional counter detector filled with gas at 40 bar located near a nuclear reactor would be a simple way to perform such a measurement exploiting the developments made on such a technology for the search of dark matter and neutrinoless double beta decay. Different targets can be used just by replacing the gas: xenon, CF$_4$ and argon were compared and the sensitivity in one year of data taking could reach the level of $4.3 \\times 10^{-12} μ_B$, $6.5 \\times 10^{-12} μ_B$, and $8.5 \\times 10^{-12} μ_B$, respectively.",

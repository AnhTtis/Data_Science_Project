    "abstract": "Developing a quantum analog of the modern classical theory of causation, as formulated by Pearl and others using directed acyclic graphs, requires a theory of random or stochastic time development at the microscopic level, where the noncommutation of Hilbert-space projectors cannot be ignored. The Consistent Histories approach provides such a theory. How it works is shown by applying it to simple examples involving beam splitters and a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. It justifies the usual laboratory intuition that properly tested apparatus can reveal the earlier microscopic cause (e.g., radioactive decay) of a later macroscopic outcome. The general approach is further illustrated by how it resolves the Bell inequalities paradox. The difficulties encountered in an approach known as Quantum Causal Models can be traced to its lack of a satisfactory theory of quantum random processes.",

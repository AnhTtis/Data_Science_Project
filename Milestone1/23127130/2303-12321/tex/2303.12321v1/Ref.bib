  title     = "Multipole Orders and Fluctuations in Strongly Correlated
               Electron Systems",
  author    = "Kuramoto, Yoshio and Kusunose, Hiroaki and Kiss, Annam{\'a}ria",
  abstract  = "In this paper we review experimental and theoretical results on
               higher electronic multipoles in solids with strong correlations.
               Recent experiments and their theoretical interpretation have
               confirmed the ordering of octupoles and even higher multipoles
               in rare-earth and actinide compounds with f electrons. The
               concept of multipoles is critically examined in point groups
               where spherical tensors of different ranks mix. Using a
               phenomenological approach, we demonstrate how linear and
               nonlinear couplings of different multipoles lead to rich phase
               diagrams and anomalies in physical observables. As actual
               representative systems, we first consider Ce x La 1- x B 6 , for
               which resonant X-ray scattering probed the octupole order for
               the first time, and NpO 2 , where quadrupoles induced by the
               octupole order have been observed. We then consider a class of
               compounds called skutterudites as the most convenient system for
               systematic study. Particular emphasis is placed on the ordering
               of scalar components from fourth-rank tensors (hexadecapoles)
               and sixth-rank tensors (hexacontatetrapoles). A comparison of a
               skutterudite PrFe 4 P 12 and URu 2 Si 2 is made, where much
               fewer carriers remain in the ordered states than in the
               disordered phase. The even number (two) of f electrons per site
               in Pr 3+ or U 4+ makes the system free from the Kramers
               degeneracy, in contrast to standard models for Mott transitions.
               Hence, it is pointed out that multipole orders, particularly the
               scalar order, should provide a new route for studying the
               dichotomy between the itinerant and localized behaviors of
               electrons.",

               spin--orbit coupling can have marked qualitative effects on the
               band structure of weakly interacting solids, leading to a
               distinct phase of matter, the topological band insulator. We
               show that spin--orbit interaction also has quantitative and
               qualitative effects on the correlation-driven Mott insulator
               transition. Taking Ir-based pyrochlores as a specific example,
               we predict that for weak electron--electron interaction Ir
               electrons are in metallic and topological band insulator phases
               at weak and strong spin--orbit interaction, respectively. We
               show that by increasing the electron--electron interaction
               strength, the effects of spin--orbit coupling are enhanced. With
               increasing interactions, the topological band insulator is
               transformed into a `topological Mott insulator' phase having
               gapless surface spin-only excitations. The proposed phase
               diagram also includes a region of gapless Mott insulator with a
               spinon Fermi surface, and a magnetically ordered state at still
               larger electron--electron interaction. Mott insulators are
               driven by strong Coulomb repulsion and topological insulators by
               strong spin--orbit coupling. Although these effects are normally
               in competition, in some cases the Coulomb interaction can
               enhance the effects of spin--orbit coupling. Together these

  abstract  = "A quantum-liquid state of spin--orbital-entangled magnetic
               moments is observed in the 5d-electron honeycomb iridate
               H3LiIr2O6, evidenced by the absence of magnetic ordering down to
               0.05 kelvin. When materials with interacting spins are cooled,
               magnetic states with long-range ordering usually emerge.
               However, quantum effects have been predicted to prevent
               long-range ordering all the way down to temperatures close to
               absolute zero in materials known as quantum spin liquids, where
               the term 'liquid' refers to the disordered state of the spins.
               The realization of such a state in a material with a honeycomb
               lattice, such as graphene, is expected to also reveal
               topological excitations. Hidenori Takagi and colleagues
               demonstrate a quantum-spin-liquid state in the 5d honeycomb
               iridate H3LiIrO6, which shows no magnetic ordering down to 0.05
               kelvin. Signatures of unusual excitations suggest that this
               material is a topological quantum-spin-liquid candidate. The
               honeycomb lattice is one of the simplest lattice structures.
               Electrons and spins on this simple lattice, however, often form
               exotic phases with non-trivial excitations. Massless Dirac
               fermions can emerge out of itinerant electrons, as demonstrated
               experimentally in graphene1, and a topological quantum spin
               liquid with exotic quasiparticles can be realized in spin-1/2
               magnets, as proposed theoretically in the Kitaev model2. The
               quantum spin liquid is a long-sought exotic state of matter, in
               which interacting spins remain quantum-disordered without
               spontaneous symmetry breaking3. The Kitaev model describes one
               example of a quantum spin liquid, and can be solved exactly by
               introducing two types of Majorana fermion2. Realizing a Kitaev
               model in the laboratory, however, remains a challenge in
               materials science. Mott insulators with a honeycomb lattice of
               spin--orbital-entangled pseudospin-1/2 moments have been
               proposed4, including the 5d-electron systems $\alpha$-Na2IrO3
               (ref. 5) and $\alpha$-Li2IrO3 (ref. 6) and the 4d-electron
               system $\alpha$-RuCl3 (ref. 7). However, these candidates were
               found to magnetically order rather than form a liquid at
               sufficiently low temperatures8,9,10, owing to non-Kitaev
               interactions6,11,12,13. Here we report a quantum-liquid state of
               pseudospin-1/2 moments in the 5d-electron honeycomb compound
               H3LiIr2O6. This iridate does not display magnetic ordering down
               to 0.05 kelvin, despite an interaction energy of about 100
               kelvin. We observe signatures of low-energy fermionic
               excitations that originate from a small number of spin defects
               in the nuclear-magnetic-resonance relaxation and the specific
               heat. We therefore conclude that H3LiIr2O6 is a quantum spin
               liquid. This result opens the door to finding exotic
               quasiparticles in a strongly spin--orbit-coupled 5d-electron
               transition-metal oxide.",

              doped SLMTO red phosphors have been vigorously investigated due
              to their higher red emission efficiency compared to commercial

              higher temperature, 1400 C, were weaker in the blue emission
              regions (at around 400 nm) and became enhanced in near infrared

                   consists of a crystalline-electric field scheme with the
                   ground-state $\Gamma_3$ non-Kramers doublet and the excited
                   singlet $\Gamma_1$ state. We find various triple-$q$ orders
                   in the four-sublattice mean-field approximation. A few
                   partial orders of quadrupoles are stabilized in a wide range
                   of parameter space at a higher transition temperature than
                   single-$q$ orders. With lowering the temperature, these
                   partial orders undergo phase transitions into further
                   symmetry broken phases in which nonvanishing quadrupole
                   moments emerge at previously disordered sites. The obtained
                   phases in the mean-field approximation are investigated by a
                   phenomenological Landau theory, which clearly shows that the
                   cubic invariant plays an important role for stabilizing the

               multiorbital systems, focusing on non-Kramers f2 states. The
               Cooper pairs in this class of superconductivity are mainly local
               pairs with the same symmetry as the local f2 ground states. When
               the local ground state is an anisotropic representation, the
               superconducting gap has nodes on the Fermi surface. This nodal
               superconductivity is mediated by the strong on-site interorbital
               attractions arising from the negative-U physics, generalized in
               multiorbital systems. We show that this is realized in a simple
               two-orbital model with antiferro Hund?s coupling and enhanced
               inter-orbital interactions derived via a systematic local down

                   is recently evidenced by the sound-velocity softening. We
                   find that the quadrupole moments play an important role in
                   determining the magnetic structure in the ordered states.
                   For a wide range of parameter space, we obtain two
                   triple-$\mathcal\{Q\}$ magnetic orders in our 36-site
                   mean-field analysis: toroidal order and another one with the
                   same number of disordered sites as in the toroidal order. We
                   name the latter ``triforce'' order after its magnetic
                   structure. Importantly, the triforce order possesses exactly
                   the same spin structure factor as the toroidal order does,
                   while the phase factors in the superposition of the
                   triple-$\mathcal\{Q\}$ structure are different. We show that
                   the triforce order is consistent with the observed
                   current-induced magnetization when the realistic crystal
                   structure of $\{\rm UNi_4B\}$ is taken into account. We
                   compare the predictions of the triforce order with the
                   experimental data available at present in detail and also
                   discuss possible applications of the present mechanism for
                   triple-$\mathcal\{Q\}$ orders to anisotropic correlated
                   systems.",

    "abstract": "We perform a detailed study of the consequences of isospin symmetry in the Cabibbo favoured $D\\to\\Kbarππ$ decays. These processes are important for precision testing of the Standard Model and for hadronic physics. Combining isospin symmetry with a dispersive reconstruction theorem we derive a representation in terms of one-variable functions which allows one to predict all the $D\\to\\Kbarππ$ amplitudes given inputs from one $D^+$ mode and one $D^0$ mode. From this, using dispersion relations and unitarity, we derive a set of 6+6 Khuri-Treiman type integral equations which enable to take three-body rescattering effects into account. A first test of this approach is presented using experimental results on the $D^+\\to K_S\\piz\\pip$ and the $D^0\\to K_S\\pim\\pip$ modes.",

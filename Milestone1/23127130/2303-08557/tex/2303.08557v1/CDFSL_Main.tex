\begin{abstract}
Deep learning has been highly successful in computer vision with large amounts of labeled data, but struggles with limited labeled training data. To address this, Few-shot learning (FSL) is proposed, but it assumes that all samples (including source and target task data, where target tasks are performed with prior knowledge from source ones) are from the same domain, which is a stringent assumption in the real world. To alleviate this limitation, Cross-domain few-shot learning (CDFSL) has gained attention as it allows source and target data from different domains and label spaces. This paper provides a comprehensive review of CDFSL at the first time, which has received far less attention than FSL due to its unique setup and difficulties. We expect this paper to serve as both a position paper and a tutorial for those doing research in CDFSL. This review first introduces the definition of CDFSL and the issues involved, followed by the core scientific question and challenge. A comprehensive review of validated CDFSL approaches from the existing literature is then presented, along with their detailed descriptions based on a rigorous taxonomy. Furthermore, this paper outlines and discusses several promising directions of CDFSL that deserve further scientific investigation, covering aspects of problem setups, applications and theories.
% In recent years, deep learning has been highly successful in computer vision, by leveraging large amounts of supervised data but it often fails when the data set is small. Few-shot learning (FSL), aimed at solving a target task with only very limited supervised information available, is proposed to address this problem.
% However, deep learning based methods usually do not perform well and even worse than traditional machine learning algorithms when there are no enough supervised samples. Based on this problem, researchers study a new problem, which is few-shot learning. 
%Few-shot learning aims at solving a target task with only very limited supervised information available. 
% However, FSL assumes that all samples are i.i.d., which is a very strict assumption in the real world. To tackle this problem, Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CDFSL) is studied in recent years. CDFSL leverages prior knowledge learned from a supervised auxiliary dataset to solve a target task with limited supervised information available, where the auxiliary datasets and target datasets come from two different domains and different label spaces. These procedures are of both practical and theoretical importance, as they are crucial for many realistic scenarios in which data is either costly or even impossible to retrieve. Furthermore, they alleviate the limitation of requiring the auxiliary data that come from the same domain with target data in few-shot task. This survey, to our best knowledge, is the first work focusing on the topic of cross-domain few-shot learning, which has received far less attention compared to few-shot learning due to its unique challenges. This survey provides an extensive overview and detailed description of approaches which have been validated from the current literature, and classifies these works according to a strict taxonomy. Furthermore, we also review and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each category. Besides, the promising directions of challenges, techniques, and applications in CDFSL are also proposed to provide insights for future research.

    "abstract": "Mobile and embedded machine learning developers frequently have to compromise between two inferior on-device deployment strategies: sacrifice accuracy and aggressively shrink their models to run on dedicated low-power cores; or sacrifice battery by running larger models on more powerful compute cores such as neural processing units or the main application processor. In this paper, we propose a novel Gated Compression layer that can be applied to transform existing neural network architectures into Gated Neural Networks. Gated Neural Networks have multiple properties that excel for on-device use cases that help significantly reduce power, boost accuracy, and take advantage of heterogeneous compute cores. We provide results across five public image and audio datasets that demonstrate the proposed Gated Compression layer effectively stops up to 96% of negative samples, compresses 97% of positive samples, while maintaining or improving model accuracy.",

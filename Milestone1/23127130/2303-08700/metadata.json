    "abstract": "The quantum mechanical weak value $A_w=\\left\\langle φ|A|ψ\\right \\rangle / \\left\\langle φ| ψ\\right\\rangle$ of an observable $A$ is a measurable quantity associated with an observable $A$ and pre- and post-selected states $\\vert ψ\\rangle, \\vert φ\\rangle$. Much has been discussed about the meaning and metrological uses of anomalous weak values, lying outside of the range of eigenvalues of $A$. We show that anomalous weak values require that both $\\vertψ\\rangle, \\vert φ\\rangle$ display coherence in the eigenbasis of $A$. We also present conditions under which anomalous $A_w$ are witnesses of generalized contextuality.",

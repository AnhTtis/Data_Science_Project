%% files in BibTeX format.
%%
%% You can then either use BibTeX with the ACM-Reference-Format style,
%% or BibLaTeX with the acmnumeric or acmauthoryear sytles, that include

%%
%% Look at the sample-*-biblatex.tex files for templates showcasing

%%
%% The majority of ACM publications use numbered citations and

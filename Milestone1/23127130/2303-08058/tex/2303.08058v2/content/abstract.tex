Ranging from NVIDIA GPUs to AMD GPUs and Intel GPUs: Given the heterogeneity of
  available accelerator cards within current supercomputers, portability is a
  key aspect for modern HPC applications. In Octo-Tiger, an astrophysics
  application simulating binary star systems and stellar mergers, we rely on
  Kokkos and its various execution spaces for portable compute kernels. In
  turn, we use HPX, a distributed task-based runtime system, to coordinate
  kernel launches, CPU tasks, and communication. This combination allows us to
  have a fine interleaving between portable CPU/GPU computations and
  communication, enabling scalability on various supercomputers.

However, for HPX and Kokkos to work together optimally, we need to be able to
  treat Kokkos kernels as HPX tasks. Otherwise, instead of integrating
  asynchronous Kokkos kernel launches into HPX's task graph, we would have to
  actively wait for them with fence commands, which wastes CPU time better
  spent otherwise. Using an integration layer called HPX-Kokkos, treating
  Kokkos kernels as tasks already works for some Kokkos execution spaces (like
  the CUDA one), but not for others (like the SYCL one).

In this work, we started making Octo-Tiger and HPX itself compatible with SYCL.
  To do so, we introduce numerous software changes most notably an HPX-SYCL
  integration. This integration allows us to treat SYCL events as HPX tasks,
  which in turn allows us to better integrate Kokkos by extending the support
  of HPX-Kokkos to also fully support Kokkos' SYCL execution space.

We show two ways to implement this HPX-SYCL integration and test them using
  Octo-Tiger and its Kokkos kernels, on both an NVIDIA A100 and an AMD MI100.
  We find modest, yet noticeable, speedups ($1.11$x to $1.15$x for the relevant
  configurations) by enabling this integration, even when just running simple
  single-node scenarios with Octo-Tiger where communication and CPU utilization
  are not yet an issue. We further find that the integration using event polling
  within the HPX scheduler works far better than the alternative implementation
  using SYCL host tasks.

We have provided two algorithms, the \emph{flag-mean} \& \emph{flag-median}, that estimate flag-prototypes of points defined on flag manifolds using chordal distance. We have established the convergence of our IRLS algorithm yielding the flag-median. Our methodologies deviate from the existing literature~\cite{draper2014flag, mankovich2022flag} which average Grassmannians into flags, and are found to be useful when either inherent outlier-robustness is necessary or when the subspaces possess a natural order, (e.g., hierarchical data). Since flag manifolds generalize Grassmannians, our methods can average on a broader class of manifolds. Consequently, we have applied our averages to rigid motions via group contraction.

\paragraph{Limitations \& future work} Our method can become computationally expensive when applied to high-dimensional problems. Moreover, our convergence results are weaker than desired as we have not provided a convergence rate. Besides addressing these, our future work involves clustering and inference on data with hierarchical structures.

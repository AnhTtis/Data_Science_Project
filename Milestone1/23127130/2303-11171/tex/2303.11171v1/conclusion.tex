For the TREC NeuCLIR 22 competition, we submitted runs in an effort to compare monolingual and AdHoc strategies. From the results, it seems that there is an interest in focusing on monolingual retrievers, however, given the larger literature and experiments in English, the AdHoc strategy is cheaper and as good/better than monolingual. Also much to our dismay, document translation worked the best out of all tested strategies. Finally, we also noticed that there's a need for a better development set in order to continue the efforts in this direction.

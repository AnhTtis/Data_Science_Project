\section{Initial query analysis (nDCG values come from an older version of the qrels)}

\subsection{Topic 0}

\paragraph{Why we selected it:} Highest difference between median and max nDCG@20 in Russian (0.8983 vs 0.2732).

\paragraph{Title:} Iranian female athletes refugees

\paragraph{Description: } I am looking for stories about Iranian female athletes who seek asylum in other countries.

\paragraph{Narrative:} Find articles that identify female athletes who refused to return to Iran after competition and slam government by seeking asylum from other countries. Relevant documents must identify the athlete by name, and spell out the reason for seeking asylum and if they joined Refugee Team in Olympic competition. ``Official'' or unofficial reasons are equally acceptable, as long as the document gives some reason that the athlete refused to return after the competition,name of the countries that accepted their request, and Iran government reaction.

\paragraph{Why we think it is hard:} This query is directly meant for Iranian data, which probably makes it more sparse in Russian-based data. This is confirmed by the number of related documents found (12 in Russian and 99 in Farsi). 

\paragraph{How did our methods perform:} Looking at our methods it seemed that we found most of the related docs (11 out of 12) and effectively place them at the top (0.88 nDCG for our best model). 

\subsection{Topic 4}

\paragraph{Why we selected it:} Worst median mAP for Farsi (only 0.0024).

\paragraph{Title:} Corruption during construction of Vostochny Cosmodrome

\paragraph{Description: } I am looking for reports on officials convicted of corruption in the construction of the Russian Space launch Complex at Vostochny in the Far East.

\paragraph{Narrative:} Find articles on corruption and conviction of Russian officials and businessmen involved in the construction of the Russian Space launch Complex in Vostochny in the Far East. Relevant articles are to include information on Individuals, their duties, the crimes they are accused of, and plans by Roscosmos to alleviate the damage they did to the project. Issues not attributed to corruption are not relevant.

\paragraph{Why we think it is hard:} As the previous query, this deals with information mostly from a Russian point of view, thus making it normal to be very sparse in Farsi. Again this is confirmed by the number of related documents found (12 in Russian and 10 in Farsi). Another problem is on the entity (Vostochny Cosmodrome), it poses problems both for monolingual (tokenization may break the name) and for Adhoc (translation may remove the name).

\paragraph{How did our methods perform:} Our monolingual Farsi first stage achieved the best mAP, but all our other runs suffered, especially the reranked ones (probably due to the entity problem). 

\subsection{Topic 18}

\paragraph{Why we selected it:} Worst median nDCG@10 on Farsi (0 median, 0.74 max).

\paragraph{Title:} The situation of myopia rate among K12 students in China

\paragraph{Description: } I am interested in finding information about the situation of myopia among K12 students in China.

\paragraph{Narrative:} Find articles carry information about the situation of myopia rate among K12 students in China. Relevant documents should include information about the current situation and/or changes of the myopia rate, factors that affect the eyesight of K12 students, and the trend. Articles about the prevention and treatment of myopia, the research in the area of vision health, are not considered relevant.

\paragraph{Why we think it is hard:} As per the previous queries, this searches for Chinese information in the Farsi database, thus making judgments very sparse (only 5 positives). However, it is not as hard on the Russian database, pointing possibly to a language drift (K12 could have another name in Farsi).

\paragraph{How did our methods perform:} Our monolingual runs completely failed on this query (0.08 and 0.09 nDCG), but our Adhoc reranked got a very good result (0.6510). Looking at the baselines we confirm that only the document-translated runs could get a good result, pointing to the treatment of the Farsi language as the probable cause of trouble in this query.

\subsection{Topic 19}

\paragraph{Why we selected it:} No related documents found in Russian and not present in Farsi

\paragraph{Title:} Cases of formaldehyde related pollution in household products

\paragraph{Description: } I am interested in finding information about the situation of myopia among K12 students in China.

\paragraph{Narrative:} Find articles carry information about cases of formaldehyde related pollution in household products in China. Relevant articles should mention specific events that involve the pollution with information about the harms resulted in. Articles that discuss about the pollution of excessive formaldehyde, the harms and remedies, without mentioning any specific cases, are not considered relevant. Articles that discuss other types of pollutions found in household products are not considered relevant

\paragraph{Why we think it is hard:} This query misses the ``In China'' part when looking at just the title, which can cause problems with runs that only include the title. Moreover, as per the previous queries, this searches for Chinese information in the Russian database. 

\paragraph{How did our methods perform:} No related documents were found, however, nDCG is not 0 which we found very weird.

\subsection{Topic 20}

\paragraph{Why we selected it:} Worst median mAP in Russian (median 0.0006	and max 0.2778)

\paragraph{Title:} Are AIDS patients discriminated against in China

\paragraph{Description: } I am interested in finding out if AIDS patients are discriminated against in China.

\paragraph{Narrative:} Find articles that carry information about whether AIDS patients in China face any discrimination in the country. Relevant articles would be those that provide information about the situation in China from the following perspectives: discussions about discriminations that are found to exist, cases of discriminations and efforts to eliminate discriminations. Articles that discuss about AIDS and AIDS patients from the perspectives of medicine and public health including treatment are not relevant. Articles about discriminations that AIDS patients face in other countries are not relevant.

\paragraph{Why we think it is hard:}  As per the previous queries, this searches for Chinese information in the Russian database and it is not even evaluated in Farsi. Also as before, tokenization may cause problems with AIDS (Especially with case insensitive, with AIDS the disease vs aids the word).

\paragraph{How did our methods perform:} Our methods suffered on this task, the monolingual run had the best effectiveness out of the methods, but far from the best overall (0.04), but the reranker made it lose. The reranked Adhoc is slightly better. Looking at the baseline runs, it seems that the problem came from the machine translation of the query, as both DT and HT had decent mAP (0.04)

\subsection{Topic 24}

\paragraph{Why we selected it:} Highest difference between median and max on both nDCG@20 and mAP in Farsi (Some methods reached mAP=1 and nDCG=1, but median is around 0.1 for both)

\paragraph{Title:} Wind energy in Russia

\paragraph{Description: } I am looking for articles on the growth of wind energy in Russia.

\paragraph{Narrative:} Find articles on the development and growth of wind energy in Russia. Include information on joint ventures with foreign firms for the production of wind turbines and related equipment. Include information on the planned outputs of windmill parks. Information on wind energy in other countries not involving cooperation with Russian entities is not required. Neither is information on other renewable or non-renewable energy resources in Russia.

\paragraph{Why we think it is hard:}  As per the previous queries, this searches for Russian information in the Farsi database. Also, methods that use the title only would miss the need of ``growth''.

\paragraph{How did our methods perform:} 

\subsection{Topic 26}

\paragraph{Why we selected it:} Worst best recall on Russian (81.58\%)

\paragraph{Title:} Ukrainian Presidential Candidate Zelenskiy

\paragraph{Description: } I am looking for articles that reflect Russia's attitude towards Ukrainian Presidential Candidate Volodymyr Zelenskiy

\paragraph{Narrative:} Find articles that reveal the Russian perspective of then presidential candidate Volodymyr Zelenskiy for the 2019 election. Include articles that highlight what Ukrainian officials say that Russian media circulates about Zelenskiy as that reveals what Russians want readers to be aware of. Russian perspective as to his ability to win, who might be supporting him, how seriously they should be taking him, and so forth. Did not include articles that discussed subsequent elections, local or parliamentary elections, or any actions Zelenskiy took once he became president. Did not include Zelenskiys recommendations on how elections in Donbass should be run. Articles purely about the polls and statistics were not included.

\paragraph{Why we think it is hard:} There's a problem with transliteration for translations, where term-based methods may miss documents due to it having written Zelenski or Zelensky or Zelenskyy (found all these variants after a quick google search). 

\paragraph{How did our methods perform:} Our final methods got decent results (78.95\% the best), but not because of SPLADE, which had very bad recall: DT: 21.05\% , MT:15.79\%, HT: 7.89\%.

\subsection{Topic 52}

\paragraph{Why we selected it:} Worst median nDCG@20 on Russian (0.1095, with a max of 0.6723) 

\paragraph{Title:} Tourism in Beijing under the Covid-19 pandemic

\paragraph{Description: } I am interested in finding information about the tourism industry in Beijing amid the Covid-19 pandemic.

\paragraph{Narrative:} Find stories about the situation of the tourism industry in Beijing under the Covid-19 pandemic. Relevant articles are those that would cover any aspect of the industry in the city, like the situation of museums and other attractions, restaurants, tour operators, etc. during the time when the pandemic remained a concern. Stories about outbound travel from Beijing would not be considered relevant. Only the actual situations would be of interest for the information search. Articles of analysis of the industry and projections, unless they do mention the actual situation, would not be considered relevant

\paragraph{Why we think it is hard:}  Again, the title misses a keyword (industry) and asks for details of China in a Russian base, with the Farsi base also not as effective (0.2321, with a max of 0.5379). 

\paragraph{How did our methods perform:} Our best method was almost as effective as the best (0.59 vs 0.67), but looking into our first stage rankers, we have a very large drop on the document back-translation (0.2551) compared to the query translations (0.5334)

\subsection{Topic 67}

\paragraph{Why we selected it:} Highest difference between median and max mAP on Russian (max mAP=1, median mAP=0.0606)

\paragraph{Title:} Reasons people become virtual streamers

\paragraph{Description: } I'm looking for reasons why people choose to stream online virtually behind an avatar.

\paragraph{Narrative:} Find articles explaining why people choose to stream online virtually behind a 2D or 3D avatar. Relevant articles shoud provide attribute or positive aspects of streaming virtually that are superior to traditional live-person broadcast.

\paragraph{Why we think it is hard:} This is the first topic from the set we analyzed that is not dependent on a language (or focused on a local subject). The lack of the Vtuber (or V-tuber) keyword could be something problematic here, but actually, the main problem is that there's only one positive. 

\paragraph{How did our methods perform:} All methods found the only positive, but only the SPLADE DT had it at the first position, with the other methods putting it at best at 5th.

\subsection{Topic 72}

\paragraph{Why we selected it:} Not evaluated in Farsi

\paragraph{Title:} Playing games could effectively prevent dementia

\paragraph{Description: } I'm looking for articles on whether playing games could prevent or delay the onset of dementia.

\paragraph{Narrative:} Find articles that mention playing games could prevent or delay the onset of dementia. Table top games and video games are equally relevant. Relevant articles should provide examples of games being played that have shown evidance of cognitive maintanance. Relevant articles should also mention what type of cognitive activity or region of brain these games positively stimulate.

\paragraph{Why we think it is hard:}  Like the previous one, this one does not necessarily focus on a particular language, but it could be that no results exist on the database, as it seems to be the case for Farsi. In Russian, there were some results.

\subsection{Topic 118}

\paragraph{Why we selected it:} Worst best nDCG@20 on Russian (0.4967, with a median of 0.2607) and also the worst best Recall@1k on Farsi (85.02\%).

\paragraph{Title:} Arbitrary detention of foreigners and Iranian dual nationals by Iran

\paragraph{Description: } I'm looking for articles reporting on the arbitrary detention of foreigners and Iranian dual nationals by Iran.

\paragraph{Narrative:} Find articles that show whether the arbitrary detention of foreign nationals and dual nationals by Iran is for political or economic gain or whether they are allegedly spies for Iran. What is the reaction of governments and international institutions? Is this a government hostage-taking.

\paragraph{Why we think it is hard:} Again, we have the problem of looking for pieces of information of ``one'' base in another. However, it also ``caused problems'' on Farsi, but for the opposite reason: there were too many positives (287). 

\paragraph{How did our methods perform:} In Farsi we are able to achieve the best possible Recall on the Adhoc but slightly less on the monolingual task. While in Russian we are almost able to match the best nDCG@20 (0.4955 vs 0.4967) and have similar effects on both Adhoc and monolingual.

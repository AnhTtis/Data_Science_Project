I hope that studies on the principles of humanoid robots can lead to something useful for humans in the near future. Master's Degree - It is a shared dream of my family that has finally been realized through possible hints from several souls along the way of my journey. 
Also, this is my first step to entering professional robotics research. 

I feel that I am one of the lucky ones who have been fortunate enough to express my sincere gratitude to all the good hearts who stood firmly behind me in every situation. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my thesis advisor, Prof. Yonghwan Oh, for his continuous support of my master's studies and related research, his patience, motivation, and immense knowledge. 
His kindness, valuable guidance, friendly attitude, persistent encouragement, effort, and first-class mentoring not only shaped me and this work but also encouraged me to decipher the complex codes of research. 
I could not have asked for a better advisor and mentor for my master's program. 
In addition to my advisor, I would also like to thank the rest of my thesis committee, Prof. Doik Kim and Prof. Keehoon Kim for their insightful comments and encouragement, as well as for asking me difficult questions that led me to look at my research from different angles. 

Any kind of gratitude would be incomplete without expressing praise and thanks to my thesis advisor and supervisor, Jongwoo Lee. 
His vibrant energy and catalytic motivation, as well as his discipline in research ethics, have greatly helped me to realize the philosophy of science and life. 
I admire him greatly and firmly believe that he will achieve more in the future. 
My thanks to all my colleagues, especially Dr. Giuk Lee, Dr. Jung Hoon Kim, Ho-Sang Mun, Sangwook Lee, Joonhee Jo, and S. J. Yoo, who have been very kind, considerate, and supportive.  

What can be better than brother Ramesh? I pay my deepest love, respect, and thanks to him for always encouraging, motivating, and supporting me. 
They have already become members of my family and I promise that we will be very close in the near future. 
My biggest thanks go to my friends, brothers Dat, Hung, Toan, Huy, Viet, Mahmoud, Nhat, Mai, Azeem, and Vivek for the wonderful soccer and table tennis games, drinking parties, and evenings.  

Words cannot express how much I am indebted to my kind parents Vu Thai Binh and Tran Mai Hoa and my beloved naughty little brother Vu Nhat Tan for their love and support. And I feel deep gratitude for my grandparents and relatives

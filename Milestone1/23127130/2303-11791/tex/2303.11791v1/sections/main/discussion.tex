\section{Limitations and Future Work}

% 1. indoor tracking: street
% 2. multi-object tracking
% 3. supervised training: data collection, data bias, ...

Now our work is limited to 2D indoor tracking. However, our proposed method is also compatible with 3D tracking in the wild, which remains not validated due to the difficulty of collecting and labeling 3D data. It is prospective to extend our method to 3D scenes, which will meet more diversified real needs in fields like autonomous driving and security.
Apart from that, our pipeline is now applied to single-object tracking tasks. It is natural to consider extending our method to multi-object tracking. The analysis of this problem will be difficult because the complexity of motion information doesn't accumulate linearly with the number of objects.
Besides, developing self-supervised or semi-supervised techniques on NLOS tracking is also a promising perspective, which helps the generalization of models.

% our model is only trained on the dataset with frame rate of 30 FPS, which might not be compatible with video streams of other frame rates. 

% One limitation of our method arises from the supervised training configuration. The generalization ability of our model is limited by the scope of collected training data, especially when data collecting and labelling is cumbersome. It takes a lot of time to render adequate data for training while calibrating real-shot data is a tough work as well. Besides, the specific settings for collecting data will affect the data distribution, \eg, frame rate of collected videos. Therefore, it is promising to develop self-adaptive methods in passive NLOS.

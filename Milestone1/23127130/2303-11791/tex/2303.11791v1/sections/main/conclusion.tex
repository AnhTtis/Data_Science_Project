\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we formally propose and formulate the task of real-time passive NLOS tracking.
We introduce difference frame which conveys clean motion information and helps to reconstruct a continuous and smooth trajectory. 
In addition, we propose a novel and concise network architecture, PAC-Net, which is capable of maintaining good continuity and stability via processing raw frames and difference frames alternately.
Note that PAC-Net is a framework-level architecture, and thus can be applied to other reconstruction tasks with dense observation in time series.
We mitigate the dilemma of initialization of a recurrent-fashion network to some extent by disentangling an independent Warm-up Stage.
To evaluate our proposed method and facilitate data-driven techniques, we establish the first passive NLOS tracking dataset, NLOS-Track, which contains about 1500 videos of realistic scenes. Both real-shot data and synthetic data are included to generalize the dataset. \\

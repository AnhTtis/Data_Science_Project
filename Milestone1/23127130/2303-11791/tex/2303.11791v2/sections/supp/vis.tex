\section{More Visualisations}

To demonstrate the test results in real scenes in an intuitive way, we attach two demo videos in supplementary materials\footnote{Demos can also be found on the \href{https://againstentropy.github.io/NLOS-Track/}{project website}.}. In each video, we present the equivalent real-time reconstructed trajectory, along with the corresponding raw stream and difference stream. We use red squares to highlight when and where the faint variation in the relay wall can be detected by naked eyes with difference frames.

\section{Limitations and Future Work}

Now our work is limited to 2D indoor tracking. However, our proposed method is also compatible with 3D tracking in the wild, which remains not validated due to the difficulty of collecting and labeling 3D data. It is prospective to extend our method to 3D scenes, which will meet more diversified real needs in fields like autonomous driving and security.
Apart from that, our pipeline is now applied to single-object tracking tasks. It is natural to consider extending our method to multi-object tracking. The analysis of this problem will be difficult because the complexity of motion information doesn't accumulate linearly with the number of objects.
Besides, developing self-supervised or semi-supervised techniques on NLOS tracking is also a promising perspective, which helps the generalization of models.

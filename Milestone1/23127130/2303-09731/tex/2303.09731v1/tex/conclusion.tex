\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:Conclusion}
In this paper, we systematically analyze the working mechanisms of recent appearing attacks and summarize their common weaknesses in violating the depth-density law and failing to imitate the local parts of real objects.
Based on the defensive insights, we propose a novel plug-and-play defense method which adopts a LOP module to work by side of an arbitrary LiDAR-based object detector to detect and eliminate forged obstacles from its prediction results.
To handle the complexity of the depth-density law and the local object feature, we build the LOP with an off-the-shelf point-wise PC classifier and explicitly expand the input point feature with the derived depth information.
We present extensive experiments spanning three state-of-the-art 3D object detectors and three known appearing attacks
% , on both the standard benchmark KITTI dataset and real-world PC data we collect from a real-car test, 
on the standard benchmark KITTI dataset,
which validate the effectiveness and flexibility of our proposed defense.
Furthermore, we deploy and evaluate the LOP in an end-to-end self-driving system, which validates the system-level usefulness of our proposed defense.
% To validate the effectiveness and flexibility of our proposed defense, we conduct extensive experiments covering three state-of-the-art 3D object detectors and three known appearing attacks, with both the standard benchmark KITTI and real-world PC data we collect from a real-car test.

% \louis{Experiment results show} that our LOP can improve the performance of three state-of-the-art 3D object detectors in normal circumstance or under attacks.
% We further gather the PC data sampled by LiDAR \louis{in a closed road environment}, and prove that our LOP can also perform well in the real world.

% We conjecture that to better defend against appearing attacks or even other latent adversarial attacks, it is necessary to fuse multiple object detectors based-on \louis{different sources of input}, and deploy related defense on each object detector participated in this fusion.
% Thus, our work offers the basis for designing such robust object detectors for ADS.

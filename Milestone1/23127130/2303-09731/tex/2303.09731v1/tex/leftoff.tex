Formally,   Specifically, we propose to split the input space of each original training samples into equal-size small pillars, and annotate the  for our LOP based on the pillars. Specifically, we construct pairs of training samples for LOP solely with a standard training dataset for LiDAR-based object detectors (e.g., KITTI \cite{andreas2012kitti}). 

, i.e., the true spatial and semantic information of a real object present in input, 

In the past decade, deep learning has experienced great achievements in many domains such as finance \cite{Heaton2016DeepLF}, healthcare \cite{Esteva2017DermatologistlevelCO} and transportation \cite{edward2016doctorai,jiaxuan2019anAutomated}, 
bringing evolutionary changes to the industry landscape.
Among these, a

% Besides, the differences of defense effect between the 3D object detector with our LOP and the 3D object detector with SOR Besides, the differences of defense effect between our LOP and SOR are less than $5\%$ in most cases.

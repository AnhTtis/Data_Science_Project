\section{Fusion Experiments}
\label{appendix:fusion}
\noindent$\bullet$\textbf{ Experimental Settings.} According to \cite{Hallyburton2021SecurityAO}, we choose the fusion model EPNet, which can prevent appearing attacks in a certain degree, as the defense target. Based on the official implementation of EPNet, we implement the \textit{Physical} attack against EPNet, and evaluate its performance on KITTI with or without LOP. Table \ref{tab:EXP2-2} reports the corresponding results.

\noindent$\bullet$\textbf{ Results \& Analysis.} As we can see from Table \ref{tab:EXP2-2}, without our LOP, the physical attacks can still forging objects in EPNet's detection and bring down the precision of it. However, the ASR of physical attack on EPNet can be reduced to less than $3\%$ with the support of our LOP, and the ASR will further be reduced to $0\%$ when we deploy PointNet-based LOP with $B=0.5,0.6$ on EPNet. Besides, the precision of EPNet with LOP also increased at least $12.32\%$ under attacks and at least $13.45\%$ in the normal circumstances. In summary, we believe LOP should not be viewed a competitor for multi-sensor fusion. Instead, LOP empirically improves the robustness of the fusion models and the 3D object detectors. As LOP has no interruption on the prediction on the image input and simply focus on eliminating malicious objects, LOP would not hurt the benefits of fusion models in self-driving systems.

\section{Experiment on Real-world Data}
\label{app:realworld}
\noindent\textbf{Experiment Settings.}  We also evaluate the effectiveness of our defense with an experimental vehicle for automated driving, the D-KIT Advanced \cite{DKit} (Fig.\ref{fig:real_car}). Specifically, we collect the PCs captured by the Velodyne 128 LiDAR of the D-KIT Advanced when the ADS drives in a closed environment with ${5}$ moving obstacles. In detail, we gather $58$ frames of PCs from two independent driving tests (with different tracks) and annotate the ground-truth bounding boxes of the obstacles in the surrounding environment with the aid of the D-KIT Advanced. Next, we generate adversarial examples by the three appearing attacks we cover based on these clean samples. Then, we evaluate the performance of these 3D object detectors with and without the LOP. Table \ref{tab:real_pre} \& \ref{tab:real_asr} presents the precision of these 3D object detectors on cars and the ASR of the three attacks respectively.

\noindent\textbf{Results \& Analysis.} As we can see from Table \ref{tab:real_pre} and \ref{tab:real_asr}, our proposed defense also performs well in the real world. In the normal circumstances, the LOP can improve the performance of 3D object detectors, and their precision can reach $100\%$ in most cases. Furthermore, the 3D object detectors with LOP can limit the ASR of appearing attacks less than $20\%$ in most cases, even decrease the ASR of Baseline which aims at PointRCNN and PV-RCNN to $0\%$. 
Although the performance of LOP in the real world can not compare with that on the KITTI dataset, we argue it is mainly because the real-world scenes sampled by us are different from the scenes present in the KITTI dataset, that these real-world scenes contain more stationary objects which are not considered in the prediction of these 3D object detectors. In other words, these objects are natural noises to the 3D object detector, and may harm their performance.
In summary, our proposed defense can not only defend against appearing attacks, but also improve the performance of 3D object detectors in the real world.

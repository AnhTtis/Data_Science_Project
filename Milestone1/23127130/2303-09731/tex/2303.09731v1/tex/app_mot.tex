\section{Multi-Object Tracking}
\label{appendix:mot}
Multi-object tracking (MOT) is a mid-level task, which grounds high-level tasks such as action recognition and behavior analysis, in computer vision \cite{wenhan2021motReview}. Usually, MOT can be divided into three small tasks: detecting multiple objects, maintaining their identities and tracking their trajectories separately. In ADS, the MOT module is always deployed between the perception module and the prediction module. Because the perception module has already provided the categories and locations of the objects nearby, the MOT module is mainly responsible for tracking their trajectories in essence \cite{xinshuo2020AB3DMOT,hsu2021P3DMOT}.

More specifically, the MOT module usually takes the predictions generated by the perception module as input, and matches these predicted objects with its maintained object trajectories. For those matched predicted objects and object trajectories, the MOT module uses a Kalman Filter (KF) or its variants to update each object trajectory based on its corresponding predicted object. For those unmatched predicted objects and object trajectories, the MOT module creates new object trajectories for some predicted objects, and removes some overdue object trajectories according to the predefined heuristic rules. Finally, the MOT module sends its maintained object trajectories to the prediction module for predicting the future movement of these objects and further analyzing.

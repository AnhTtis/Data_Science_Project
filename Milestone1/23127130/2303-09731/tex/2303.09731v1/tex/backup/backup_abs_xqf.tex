\begin{abstract}
Modern self-driving systems mainly rely on object detectors, especially LiDAR-based (Light Detection and Ranging) 3D object detectors, to perceive the objects nearby autonomous vehicles. However, some adversarial attacks such as appearing attack have been proved threat to AV, because it can forge inexistent objects for 3D object detectors and further cause traffic accidents. Existing defenses remove suspect points or objects based on their statistical features, which have limitations in their performances and generalizations. In this work, we propose a local objectness detectors to distinguish the local difference between the fake objects and the real objects and avoid appearing attacks. We design our local objectness detectors based on two common properties of existing appearing attacks revealed by us. First, most existing appearing attacks are limited by attacker's goal and attacker's capability. Behind these limitations, there is an invariant relation between the depth and the point density of real objects. Second, most existing appearing attacks focus on forging the fake object which is similar as a real object in general, regardless of the local difference between them. We further deploy our local objectness detectors on three state-of-the-art 3D object detectors and evaluate these object detectors' performances. 
The results show that our local objectness detectors can increase 3D object detectors' precisions from $28\sim66\%$ to $60\sim74\%$ under appearing attacks.
% The results show that our local objectness detectors can increase 3D object detectors' precisions from $[data0]!!!$ to $[data1]!!!$ under appearing attacks.

% 摘要提纲：
% 1、自动驾驶系统依赖3D实体检测模型基于点云检测周围的实体，但现在已经证明了对抗性攻击可以有效攻击3D实体检测模型
% 2、appearing attack作为其中一种对抗性攻击，能导致3D实体检测模型检测到不存在的实体，进而导致自动驾驶小车紧急制动造成交通阻塞甚至是追尾事故
% 3、现有的防御研究都是针对其中一种或几种appearing attack设计，缺乏泛化性
% 4、我们研究了现存的几种appearing attack，发现了它们所具有的相同特点，并利用这一点设计了防御appearing attack的伪造实体检测模型。
% 5、我们通过实验发现，使用了我们的伪造实体检测模型后，3D实体检测模型的precision在无攻击场景和有攻击场景中都明显提升

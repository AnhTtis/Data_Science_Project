    "abstract": "We consider two operators $A_{0},B_{0}$ between two Hilbert spaces satisfying $A_{0}\\subseteq-B_{0}^{\\ast}$ and $B_{0}\\subseteq-A_{0}^{\\ast}$ and inspect extensions $A^{\\#}$ and $B^{\\#}$ of $A_{0}$ and $B_{0}$, respectively, whose domain consists of those elements satisfying an abstract periodic boundary condition. The motivating example is the derivative on some interval, where the so-defined realisation gives the classical derivative with periodic boundary conditions. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the operator equality $A^{\\#}=-\\left(B^{\\#}\\right)^{\\ast}$ and illustrate our findings by applications to the classical vector analytic operators $\\mathrm{grad},\\,\\mathrm{div}$ and $\\mathrm{curl}$. In particular, the realisation $\\mathrm{curl}^{\\#}$ naturally arises in the study of so-called Beltrami fields.",

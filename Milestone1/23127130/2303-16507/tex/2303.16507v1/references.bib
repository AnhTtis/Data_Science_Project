but organized in a meaningful order which illustrates gradually more concepts, and
gradually more complex ones. Here, we formalize such training strategies in the context
of machine learning, and call them "curriculum learning". In the context of recent
research studying the difficulty of training in the presence of non-convex training
criteria (for deep deterministic and stochastic neural networks), we explore curriculum
learning in various set-ups. The experiments show that significant improvements in
generalization can be achieved. We hypothesize that curriculum learning has both an
effect on the speed of convergence of the training process to a minimum and, in the
case of non-convex criteria, on the quality of the local minima obtained: curriculum
learning can be seen as a particular form of continuation method (a general strategy
for global optimization of non-convex functions).},

generalization, and adversarial robustness. While deep networks are capable of memorizing
noise data, our results suggest that they tend to prioritize learning simple patterns
first. In our experiments, we expose qualitative differences in gradient-based optimization
of deep neural networks (DNNs) on noise vs. real data. We also demonstrate that for
appropriately tuned explicit regularization (e.g., dropout) we can degrade DNN training
performance on noise datasets without compromising generalization on real data. Our
analysis suggests that the notions of effective capacity which are dataset independent
are unlikely to explain the generalization performance of deep networks when trained
with gradient based methods because training data itself plays an important role in
determining the degree of memorization.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the repeated acquisition of labels for data items when the labeling
is imperfect. We examine the improvement (or lack thereof) in data quality via repeated
labeling, and focus especially on the improvement of training labels for supervised
induction. With the outsourcing of small tasks becoming easier, for example via Rent-A-Coder
or Amazon's Mechanical Turk, it often is possible to obtain less-than-expert labeling
at low cost. With low-cost labeling, preparing the unlabeled part of the data can
become considerably more expensive than labeling. We present repeated-labeling strategies
of increasing complexity, and show several main results. (i) Repeated-labeling can
improve label quality and model quality, but not always. (ii) When labels are noisy,
repeated labeling can be preferable to single labeling even in the traditional setting
where labels are not particularly cheap. (iii) As soon as the cost of processing the
unlabeled data is not free, even the simple strategy of labeling everything multiple
times can give considerable advantage. (iv) Repeatedly labeling a carefully chosen
set of points is generally preferable, and we present a robust technique that combines
different notions of uncertainty to select data points for which quality should be
improved. The bottom line: the results show clearly that when labeling is not perfect,
selective acquisition of multiple labels is a strategy that data miners should have
in their repertoire; for certain label-quality/cost regimes, the benefit is substantial.},

year = {1994},
publisher = {MIT Press},
address = {Cambridge, MA, USA},
abstract = {In remote sensing applications "ground-truth" data is often used as the basis for
training pattern recognition algorithms to generate thematic maps or to detect objects
of interest. In practical situations, experts may visually examine the images and
provide a subjective noisy estimate of the truth. Calibrating the reliability and
bias of expert labellers is a non-trivial problem. In this paper we discuss some of
our recent work on this topic in the context of detecting small volcanoes in Magellan
SAR images of Venus. Empirical results (using the Expectation-Maximization procedure)
suggest that accounting for subjective noise can be quite significant in terms of
quantifying both human and algorithm detection performance.},

abstract = {We describe a probabilistic approach for supervised learning when we have multiple
experts/annotators providing (possibly noisy) labels but no absolute gold standard.
The proposed algorithm evaluates the different experts and also gives an estimate
of the actual hidden labels. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method
is superior to the commonly used majority voting baseline.},

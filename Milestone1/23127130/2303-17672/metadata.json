    "abstract": "Higher order finite difference Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) schemes have been constructed for conservation laws. For multidimensional problems, they offer high order accuracy at a fraction of the cost of a finite volume WENO or DG scheme of comparable accuracy. This makes them quite attractive for several science and engineering applications. But, to the best of our knowledge, such schemes have not been extended to non-linear hyperbolic systems with non-conservative products. In this paper, we perform such an extension which improves the domain of applicability of such schemes. The extension is carried out by writing the scheme in fluctuation form. We use the HLLI Riemann solver of Dumbser and Balsara (2016) as a building block for carrying out this extension. Because of the use of an HLL building block, the resulting scheme has a proper supersonic limit. The use of anti-diffusive fluxes ensures that stationary discontinuities can be preserved by the scheme, thus expanding its domain of applicability. Our new finite difference WENO formulation uses the same WENO reconstruction that was used in classical versions, making it very easy for users to transition over to the present formulation.",

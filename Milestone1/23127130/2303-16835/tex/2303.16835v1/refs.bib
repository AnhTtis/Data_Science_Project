The RTE task is defined as recognizing, given two text fragments, whether the meaning of one text can be inferred (entailed) from the other. This application-independent task is suggested as capturing major inferences about the variability of semantic expression which are commonly needed across multiple applications. The Challenge has raised noticeable attention in the research community, attracting 17 submissions from diverse groups, suggesting the generic relevance of the task.},

We present a general strategy to automatically generate one or more sentential hypotheses based on an input sentence and pre-existing manual semantic annotations. The resulting suite of datasets enables us to probe a statistical RTE model{'}s performance on different aspects of semantics. We demonstrate the value of this approach by investigating the behavior of a popular neural network RTE model.",

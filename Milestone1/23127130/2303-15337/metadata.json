    "abstract": "We study stochastic homogenization for convex integral functionals $$u\\mapsto \\int_D W(ω,\\tfrac{x}\\varepsilon,\\nabla u)\\,\\mathrm{d}x,\\quad\\mbox{where}\\quad u:D\\subset \\mathbb{R}^d\\to\\mathbb{R}^m,$$ defined on Sobolev spaces. Assuming only stochastic integrability of the map $ω\\mapsto W(ω,0,ξ)$, we prove homogenization results under two different sets of assumptions, namely\n  $\\bullet_1\\quad$ $W$ satisfies superlinear growth quantified by the stochastic integrability of the Fenchel conjugate $W^*(\\cdot,0,ξ)$ and a mild monotonicity condition that ensures that the functional does not increase too much by componentwise truncation of $u$,\n  $\\bullet_2\\quad$ $W$ is $p$-coercive in the sense $|ξ|^p\\leq W(ω,x,ξ)$ for some $p>d-1$.\n  Condition $\\bullet_2$ directly improves upon earlier results, where $p$-coercivity with $p>d$ is assumed and $\\bullet_1$ provides an alternative condition under very weak coercivity assumptions and additional structure conditions on the integrand. We also study the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations in the setting of Sobolev-Orlicz spaces. In particular, if $W(ω,x,ξ)$ is comparable to $W(ω,x,-ξ)$ in a suitable sense, we show that the homogenized integrand is differentiable.",

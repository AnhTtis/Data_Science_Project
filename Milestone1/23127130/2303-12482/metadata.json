    "abstract": "We studied kink-antikink collisions in two-dimensional spacetime for all $Z_2$ symmetric $φ^8$ models with four degenerate minima. Such a polynomial model has only one free parameter, allowing us to conduct an exhaustive analysis. We performed detailed simulations in all three sectors of the model. We observed resonance windows from both localized and delocalized modes, as well as a sector change with the formation of additional kink-antikink pairs. Furthermore, we were able to show how collisions are modified when two quadratic minima merge into a quartic one, causing the kinks to acquire a long-range character. We demonstrated that when the tail not facing the opposing kink is long-range, incoming kinks and antikinks decay directly into radiation, as suggested in \\cite{campos2021interaction}, by forming a large number of small kink-antikink pairs. Finally, we briefly discussed whether our analysis could be generalized to other polynomial models.",

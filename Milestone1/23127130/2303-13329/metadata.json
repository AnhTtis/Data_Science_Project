    "abstract": "We demonstrate that triangle singularity (TS) and box singularity (BS) mechanisms can produce unique narrow enhancements at the $Λ_c\\bar{D}$ and $Λ_c\\bar{D}^*$ thresholds in the invariant mass spectra of $J/ψp$ and $J/ψpπ$, respectively. Taking into account that such mechanisms only depend on the initial $Σ_c^{(*)}\\bar{D}^{(*)}$ interactions near threshold within the TS or BS kinematic regimes, the $Λ_c\\bar{D}$ and $Λ_c\\bar{D}^*$ threshold enhancements can be regarded as a feed-down phenomenon originated from both the heavier pentaquark decays and the $Σ_c^{(*)}\\bar{D}^{(*)}$ scatterings from the continuum. A search for these structures in the $J/ψp$ and $J/ψpπ$ spectra in both exclusive and semi-inclusive processes will provide a smoking-gun evidence for the hadronic molecule nature of those observed pentaquarks and clarify the role played by the TS and BS in the near-threshold dynamics.",

We have shown that polynomial estimators can improve existing stochastic submodular maximization methods by eliminating one of the two sources of randomness, particularly the one that stems from sampling. Investigating methodical ways to construct such polynomials can expand the applications of the proposed estimator appearing in this paper. Online versions of stochastic submodular optimization, where performance is characterized in terms of (approximate) regret, are also a possible future research direction.

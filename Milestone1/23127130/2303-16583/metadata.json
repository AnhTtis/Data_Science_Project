    "abstract": "With the constant increase of the number of autonomous vehicles and connected objects, tools to understand and reproduce their mobility models are required. We focus on chaotic dynamics and review their applications in the design of mobility models. We also provide a review of the nonlinear tools used to characterize mobility models, as it can be found in the literature. Finally, we propose a method to generate traces for a given scenario involving moving people, using tools from the nonlinear analysis domain usually dedicated to topological analysis of chaotic attractors.",

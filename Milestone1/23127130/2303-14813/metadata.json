    "abstract": "We consider two evolution equations involving space fractional Laplace operator of order $0<s<1$. We first establish some existence and uniqueness results for the considered evolution equations. Next, we give some comparison theorems and prove that, if the data of each equation are data bounded, then the solutions are also bounded.",

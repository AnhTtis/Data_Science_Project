    "abstract": "We look at rank two parabolic Higgs bundles over the projective line minus five points which are semistable with respect to a weight vector $μ\\in[0,1]^5$. The moduli space corresponding to the central weight $μ_c=(\\frac{1}{2}, \\dots, \\frac{1}{2})$ is studied in details and all singular fibers of the Hitchin map are described, including the nilpotent cone. After giving a description of fixed points of the $\\mathbb C^*$-action we obtain a proof of Simpson's foliation conjecture in this case. For each $n\\ge 5$, we remark that there is a weight vector so that the foliation conjecture in the moduli space of rank two logarithmic connections over the projective line minus $n$ points is false.",

abstract = {A single SLM (spatial light modulator) full-color holographic 3-D display based on sampling and selective frequency-filtering methods is proposed. Spatially-sampled R(red), G(green) and B(blue)-holograms can provide periodic 3 \&\#x00D7; 3 arrays of their frequency spectrums. Thus, by allocating three groups of three spectrums to each color hologram, and selectively filtering out those spectrums with their own spectrum filtering masks (SFMs), frequency-filtered R, G and B-holograms can be obtained. These holograms are synthesized into a single color-multiplexed hologram, and optically reconstructed into a color distortion-free full-color 3-D object on the 4-f lens system, where color-dispersion due to the pixelated structure of the SLM can be removed with the optical versions of SFMs. Fourier-optical analysis and experiments with 3-D color objects in motion confirm the feasibility of the proposed system in the practical application.},

We discuss some of the engineering work that made the MacroSLM possible, including the custom FPGA board for handling huge data rates, the large pixel size for minimizing rolloff and crosstalk, and the temperature control to handle heating effects from the high-voltage controls and high-power laser illumination. We also designed an FPGA implementation of the overdrive method for increasing liquid crystal switching speed, allowing us to overcome the significant data bottlenecks that limit frame rates for large arrays. We demonstrate 500 Hz hologram-tohologram speed at 1064 nm operating wavelength, and discuss the new science that these speeds and array sizes have enabled.},

@article{Lin19,
abstract = {A single spatial-light-modulator (SLM) full-color holographic 3-D video display based on image and frequency-shift multiplexing (IFSM) is proposed. In the frequency-shift multiplexing (FSM), three-color holograms are multiplied with their respective phase factors for shifted-separations of their corresponding frequency-spectrums on the Fourier plane. This FSM process, however, causes three-color images to be reconstructed at the center-shifted locations depending on their multiplied phase factors. Center-shifts of those color images due to the FSM can be balanced out just by generation of three-color holograms whose centers are pre-shifted to the opposite directions to those of the image shifts with the novel-look-up-table (NLUT) based on its shift-invariance property, which is called image-shift multiplexing (ISM). These image and frequency-shifted holograms are then multiplexed into a single color-multiplexed hologram and loaded on the SLM, and from which a full-color 3-D image can be reconstructed on the optical 4-f lens system without any color dispersion just by employing a simple pinhole filter mask. Fourier-optical analysis and experiments with 3-D objects in motion confirm the feasibility of the proposed system.},

@article{Kozacki16,
abstract = {This work presents color holographic display, which is based on a single phase only spatial light modulator (SLM). In the display entire area of the SLM is illuminated by an on-axis white light beam generated by a single large LED. The holographic display fully utilizes SLM bandwidth and has capability of full-color, full frame rate imaging of outstanding quality. This is achieved through: (i) optimal use of the source coherence volume, (ii) application of the single white light LED source, (iii) a development of a novel concept of color multiplexing technique with color filter mask in Fourier plane of the SLM, (iv) and a complex coding with improved diffraction efficiency. Within experimental part of the paper we show single color, full-color holographic 2D and 3D images generated for reconstruction depth exceeding 10 cm.},

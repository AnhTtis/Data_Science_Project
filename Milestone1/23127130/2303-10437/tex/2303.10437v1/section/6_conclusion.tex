\section{Conclusion}
We present a new challenging setting: grounding 3D object affordance from 2D interactions in images, which may unleash the potential of affordance to serve some applications (Fig. \ref{fig:app}). To support this task, we collect a dataset named PIAD that contains paired image-point cloud affordance data, it serves as the first test bed for the setting. Additionally, we propose a novel framework to correlate affordance regions of objects that are from different sources and model interaction contexts to ground 3D object affordance. Comprehensive experiments on PIAD display the reliability of the setting, and we believe it could offer fresh insights and facilitate research in the affordance area.

    "abstract": "The out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) has emerged as an interesting object in both classical and quantum systems for probing the spatial spread and temporal growth of initially local perturbations in spatially extended chaotic systems. Here, we study the (classical) OTOC and its ``light-cone'' in the nonlinear Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation, using extensive numerical simulations. We also show that the linearized KS equation exhibits a qualitatively similar OTOC and light-cone, which can be understood via a saddle-point analysis of the linearly unstable modes. Given the deep connection between the KS (deterministic) and the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (stochastic) equations, we also explore the OTOC in the KPZ equation. More broadly, our work unravels the intrinsic interplay between noise/instability, nonlinearity and dissipation in partial differential equations (deterministic or stochastic) through the lens of OTOC.",

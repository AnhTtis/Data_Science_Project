    "abstract": "We have developed a methodology to test the age-old cosmic censorship hypothesis in Kerr geometry. We have shown that the Kerr black hole can be overspun by particles captured from the innermost stable circular orbit. However, it appears that this does not happen for particles coming from infinity. We have also observed that overspinning becomes possible only when the black hole approaches a near-extremal limit, which approaches as we increase the black hole's mass. Our study demonstrates that an extremal black hole cannot be overspun. However, our methodology neglects backreaction and self-force effects, which could affect the overspinning.",

\section{2 Species Reconfiguration}

\begin{theorem}
Reconfiguration with 2 species and any number of reactions is in P.
\end{theorem}

We only consider CRNs on connected graphs, because solving reconfiguration on a disconnected graph is equivalent to solving reconfiguration in each component separately.

There are 7 possible reactions (figure), with 2 symmetries: swapping the colors and time reversal.

\begin{definition}
    We call a CRN $\Gamma = {S, R}$ \textbf{almost universal} if for every connected graph $G$, all but finitely many configurations are strongly connected, and those exceptional configurations can be efficiently enumerated.
\end{definition}

Adding reactions to an almost universal CRN preserves its almost universality, and reconfiguration in an almost universal CRN is in P. (L? AC0?)

\begin{abstract}
The field of machine learning has been greatly transformed with the
advancement of deep artificial neural networks (ANNs) and the
increased availability of annotated data. Spiking neural networks
(SNNs) have recently emerged as a low-power alternative to ANNs due to
their sparsity nature.

In this work, we propose a novel hybrid ANN-SNN co-training framework
to improve the performance of converted SNNs. Our approach is a
fine-tuning scheme, conducted through an alternating, forward-backward
training procedure. We apply our framework to object detection and
image segmentation tasks. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach in achieving the design goals.

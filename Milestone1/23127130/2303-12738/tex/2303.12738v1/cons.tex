\section{Conclusions}

In this work, we present a hybrid ANN-SNN fine-tuning scheme. Our
approach is fairly general and can potentially be applied to many
convolutional networks implemented using the soft LIF neurons or the
rectified linear neurons. We take object localization and image
segmentation as testbed applications, and the effectiveness of our
approach is well demonstrated.  Exploring more network applications,
as well as developing new co-training solutions are our next steps.

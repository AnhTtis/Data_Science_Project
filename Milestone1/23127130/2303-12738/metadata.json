    "abstract": "The field of machine learning has been greatly transformed with the advancement of deep artificial neural networks (ANNs) and the increased availability of annotated data. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently emerged as a low-power alternative to ANNs due to their sparsity nature. In this work, we propose a novel hybrid ANN-SNN co-training framework to improve the performance of converted SNNs. Our approach is a fine-tuning scheme, conducted through an alternating, forward-backward training procedure. We apply our framework to object detection and image segmentation tasks. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving the design goals.",

    "abstract": "We introduce the notion of rooftop flip, namely a small modification among normal projective varieties which is modeled by a smooth projective variety of Picard number 2 admitting two projective bundle structures. Examples include the Atiyah flop and the Mukai flop, modeled respectively by $\\mathbb{P}^1\\times \\mathbb{P}^1$ and by $\\mathbb{P}\\left(T_{\\mathbb{P}^2}\\right)$. Using the Morelli-Wlodarczyk cobordism, we prove that any smooth projective variety of Picard number 1, endowed with a $\\mathbb{C}^*$-action with only two fixed point components, induces a rooftop flip.",

    "abstract": "We construct a \"Koszul duality\" equivalence relating the (diagrammatic) Hecke category attached to a Coxeter system and a given realization to the Hecke category attached to the same Coxeter system and the dual realization. This extends a construction of Beilinson-Ginzburg-Soergel and Bezrukavnikov-Yun in a geometric context, and of the first author with Achar, Makisumi and Williamson. As an application, we show that the combinatorics of the \"tilting perverse sheaves\" considered in arXiv:1802.07651 is encoded in the combinatorics of the canonical basis of the Hecke algebra of $(W,S)$ attached to the dual realization.",

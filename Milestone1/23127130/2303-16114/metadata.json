    "abstract": "We prove algebraicity results for critical $L$-values attached to the group $\\text{GSp}_4 \\times \\text{GL}_2$, and for Gan--Gross--Prasad periods which are conjecturally related to central $L$-values for $\\text{GSp}_4 \\times \\text{GL}_2 \\times \\text{GL}_2$. A key aspect is the computation of certain archimedean zeta integrals, whose $p$-adic counterparts are also studied in this note. This is crucially used in a sequel to this paper in order to construct a new $p$-adic $L$-function for $\\text{GSp}_4 \\times \\text{GL}_2$.",

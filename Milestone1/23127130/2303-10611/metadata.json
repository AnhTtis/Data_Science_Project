    "abstract": "Undersampled MRI reconstruction is crucial for accelerating clinical scanning procedures. Recent deep learning methods for MRI reconstruction adopt CNN or ViT as backbone, which lack in utilizing the complementary properties of CNN and ViT. In this paper, we propose DuDoRNeXt, whose backbone hybridizes CNN and ViT in an domain-specific, intra-stage way. Besides our hybrid vertical layout design, we introduce domain-specific modules for dual-domain reconstruction, namely image-domain parallel local detail enhancement and k-space global initialization. We evaluate different conventions of MRI reconstruction including image-domain, k-space-domain, and dual-domain reconstruction with a reference protocol on the IXI dataset and an in-house multi-contrast dataset. DuDoRNeXt achieves significant improvements over competing deep learning methods.",

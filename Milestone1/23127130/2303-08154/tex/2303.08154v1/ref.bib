	abstract = {Measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPT) have attracted increasing attentions due to the rich phenomenology of entanglement structures and their relation with quantum information processing. Since physical systems are unavoidably coupled to environment, quantum noise needs be considered in analyzing a system with MIPT, which may qualitatively modify or even destroy certain entanglement structure of the system. In this Letter, we investigate the effect of quantum noise modeled by reset quantum channel acting on each site with probability \$q\$ on MIPT. Based on the numerical results from the Clifford circuits, we show that the quantum noise can qualitatively change the entanglement properties - the entanglement obeys ``area law'' instead of ``volume law'' with projective measurement rate \$p{\textless}p\_\{c\}\$. In the quantum noise induced ``area law'' phase, the entanglement exhibits a novel \$q{\textasciicircum}\{-1/3\}\$ power-law scaling. Using an analytic mapping of the quantum model to a classical statistical model, we further show that the ``area law'' entanglement is the consequence of the noise-driven symmetry-breaking field and the \$q{\textasciicircum}\{-1/3\}\$ scaling can be understood as the result of Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) fluctuations of the directed polymer with an effective length scale \$L\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{eff\}\} {\textbackslash}sim q{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ in a random environment.},

  abstract = {A combinatorial optimization problem becomes very difficult in situations where the energy landscape is rugged and the global minimum locates in a narrow region of the configuration space. When using the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) to tackle these hard cases, we find that difficulty mainly originates from the QAOA quantum circuit instead of the cost function. To alleviate the issue, we selectively drop out the clauses defining the quantum circuit while keeping the cost function intact. Due to the combinatorial nature of the optimization problems, the dropout of clauses in the circuit does not affect the solution. Our numerical results confirm QAOA's performance improvements with various types of quantum-dropout implementation.},

  abstract = {Quantum architecture search (QAS) is the process of automating architecture engineering of quantum circuits. It has been desired to construct a powerful and general QAS platform which can significantly accelerate current efforts to identify quantum advantages of error-prone and depth-limited quantum circuits in the NISQ era. Hereby, we propose a general framework of differentiable quantum architecture search (DQAS), which enables automated designs of quantum circuits in an end-to-end differentiable fashion. We present several examples of circuit design problems to demonstrate the power of DQAS. For instance, unitary operations are decomposed into quantum gates, noisy circuits are re-designed to improve accuracy, and circuit layouts for quantum approximation optimization algorithm are automatically discovered and upgraded for combinatorial optimization problems. These results not only manifest the vast potential of DQAS being an essential tool for the NISQ application developments, but also present an interesting research topic from the theoretical perspective as it draws inspirations from the newly emerging interdisciplinary paradigms of differentiable programming, probabilistic programming, and quantum programming.}

  journal = {Machine Learning: Science and Technology},
  abstract = {Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are widely speculated to deliver quantum advantages for practical problems under the quantum–classical hybrid computational paradigm in the near term. Both theoretical and practical developments of VQAs share many similarities with those of deep learning. For instance, a key component of VQAs is the design of task-dependent parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) as in the case of designing a good neural architecture in deep learning. Partly inspired by the recent success of AutoML and neural architecture search (NAS), quantum architecture search (QAS) is a collection of methods devised to engineer an optimal task-specific PQC. It has been proven that QAS-designed VQAs can outperform expert-crafted VQAs in various scenarios. In this work, we propose to use a neural network based predictor as the evaluation policy for QAS. We demonstrate a neural predictor guided QAS can discover powerful quantum circuit ansatz, yielding state-of-the-art results for various examples from quantum simulation and quantum machine learning. Notably, neural predictor guided QAS provides a better solution than that by the random-search baseline while using an order of magnitude less of circuit evaluations. Moreover, the predictor for QAS as well as the optimal ansatz found by QAS can both be transferred and generalized to address similar problems.}

  title = {Avoiding local minima in {Variational} {Quantum} {Algorithms} with {Neural} {Networks}},
  url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02955},
  abstract = {Variational Quantum Algorithms have emerged as a leading paradigm for near-term quantum computation. In such algorithms, a parameterized quantum circuit is controlled via a classical optimization method that seeks to minimize a problem-dependent cost function. Although such algorithms are powerful in principle, the non-convexity of the associated cost landscapes and the prevalence of local minima means that local optimization methods such as gradient descent typically fail to reach good solutions. In this work we suggest a method to improve gradient-based approaches to variational quantum circuit optimization, which involves coupling the output of the quantum circuit to a classical neural network. The effect of this neural network is to peturb the cost landscape as a function of its parameters, so that local minima can be escaped or avoided via a modification to the cost landscape itself. We present two algorithms within this framework and numerically benchmark them on small instances of the Max-Cut optimization problem. We show that the method is able to reach deeper minima and lower cost values than standard gradient descent based approaches. Moreover, our algorithms require essentially the same number of quantum circuit evaluations per optimization step as the standard approach since, unlike the gradient with respect to the circuit, the neural network updates can be estimated in parallel via the backpropagation method. More generally, our approach suggests that relaxing the cost landscape is a fruitful path to improving near-term quantum computing algorithms.},

  abstract = {Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) may be a path to quantum advantage on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers. A natural question is whether noise on NISQ devices places fundamental limitations on VQA performance. We rigorously prove a serious limitation for noisy VQAs, in that the noise causes the training landscape to have a barren plateau (i.e., vanishing gradient). Specifically, for the local Pauli noise considered, we prove that the gradient vanishes exponentially in the number of qubits n if the depth of the ansatz grows linearly with n. These noise-induced barren plateaus (NIBPs) are conceptually different from noise-free barren plateaus, which are linked to random parameter initialization. Our result is formulated for a generic ansatz that includes as special cases the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz and the Unitary Coupled Cluster Ansatz, among others. For the former, our numerical heuristics demonstrate the NIBP phenomenon for a realistic hardware noise model.},

  abstract = {One of the most important properties of neural networks is the clustering of local minima of the loss function near the global minimum, enabling efficient training. Though generative models implemented on quantum computers are known to be more expressive than their traditional counterparts, it has empirically been observed that these models experience a transition in the quality of their local minima. Namely, below some critical number of parameters, all local minima are far from the global minimum in function value; above this critical parameter count, all local minima are good approximators of the global minimum. Furthermore, for a certain class of quantum generative models, this transition has empirically been observed to occur at parameter counts exponentially large in the problem size, meaning practical training of these models is out of reach. Here, we give the first proof of this transition in trainability, specializing to this latter class of quantum generative model. We use techniques inspired by those used to study the loss landscapes of classical neural networks. We also verify that our analytic results hold experimentally even at modest model sizes.},

Here, we propose a VQE by minimizing energy variance, which is called as variance-VQE(VVQE). The VVQE can be viewed as an self-verifying eigensolver for arbitrary eigenstate by designing, since an eigenstate for a Hamiltonian should have zero energy variance. We demonstrate properties and advantages of VVQE for solving a set of excited states with quantum chemistry problems. Remarkably, we show that optimization of a combination of energy and variance may be more efficient to find low-energy excited states than those of minimizing energy or variance alone. We further reveal that the optimization can be boosted with stochastic gradient descent by Hamiltonian sampling, which uses only a few terms of the Hamiltonian and thus significantly reduces the quantum resource for evaluating variance and its gradients.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efﬁcient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the inﬁnity norm.},

  abstract = {Variational quantum circuits have been widely employed in quantum simulation and quantum machine learning in recent years. However, quantum circuits with random structures have poor trainability due to the exponentially vanishing gradient with respect to the circuit depth and the qubit number. This result leads to a general belief that deep quantum circuits will not be feasible for practical tasks. In this work, we propose an initialization strategy with theoretical guarantees for the vanishing gradient problem in general deep circuits. Specifically, we prove that under proper Gaussian initialized parameters, the norm of the gradient decays at most polynomially when the qubit number and the circuit depth increase. Our theoretical results hold for both the local and the global observable cases, where the latter was believed to have vanishing gradients even for shallow circuits. Experimental results verify our theoretical findings in the quantum simulation and quantum chemistry.},

Here, we rigorously prove two results, assuming V(θ) is an alternating layered ansatz composed of blocks forming local 2-designs. Our first result states that defining C in terms of global observables leads to exponentially vanishing gradients (i.e., barren plateaus) even when V(θ) is shallow. Hence, several VQAs in the literature must revise their proposed costs. On the other hand, our second result states that defining C with local observables leads to at worst a polynomially vanishing gradient, so long as the depth of V(θ) is \$\$\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}\}({\textbackslash}mathrm\{log\}{\textbackslash},n)\$\$. Our results establish a connection between locality and trainability. We illustrate these ideas with large-scale simulations, up to 100 qubits, of a quantum autoencoder implementation.},

A barren plateau is the phenomenon of exponentially vanishing gradients in sufficiently expressive parametrized quantum circuits. It has been established that the onset of a barren plateau regime depends on the cost function, although the particular behavior has been demonstrated only for certain classes of cost functions. Here we derive a lower bound on the variance of the gradient, which depends mainly on the width of the circuit causal cone of each term in the Pauli decomposition of the cost function. Our result further clarifies the conditions under which barren plateaus can occur.}

However, both empirical and theoretical results exhibit that the deployed ansatz heavily affects the performance of VQAs such that an ansatz with a larger number of quantum gates enables a stronger expressivity, while the accumulated noise may render a poor trainability. To maximally improve the robustness and trainability of VQAs, here we devise a resource and runtime efficient scheme termed quantum architecture search (QAS). In particular, given a learning task, QAS automatically seeks a near-optimal ansatz (i.e., circuit architecture) to balance benefits and side-effects brought by adding more noisy quantum gates to achieve a good performance. We implement QAS on both the numerical simulator and real quantum hardware, via the IBM cloud, to accomplish data classification and quantum chemistry tasks. In the problems studied, numerical and experimental results show that QAS cannot only alleviate the influence of quantum noise and barren plateaus but also outperforms VQAs with pre-selected ansatze.},

abstract = {Abstract An algorithm that accelerates the convergence of the iterative optimization of the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) wavefunction so as to find a optimum solution in fewer macroiterations is described. The algorithm is oriented to large-scale CASSCF problems that are to be solved with a combination of density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method for the configuration interaction (CI) process. The algorithm is based on the alternating (or two-step) CASSCF optimization in which the CI and molecular orbital (MO) parameters are optimized separately. Convergence ratio is improved by finding further optimized MOs from a linear extrapolation of the MO sets of the iteration history. The acceleration results in fewer diagonalizations in a total CASSCF calculation to save a considerable computational cost. The convergence performance is examined in a couple of realistic applications on SiC3 and poly(phenyl)carbenes. For poly(phenyl)carbenes, the large-size CASSCF calculations with CAS(30e,30o) that entails full π valence space as well as sp2 orbital space of carbenes are performed by using the practical implementation of DMRG-CASSCF in conjunction with the acceleration technique. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Such hybrid quantum-classical algorithms are popular for applications in quantum simulation, optimization, and machine learning. Due to its simplicity and hardware efficiency, random circuits are often proposed as initial guesses for exploring the space of quantum states. We show that the exponential dimension of Hilbert space and the gradient estimation complexity make this choice unsuitable for hybrid quantum-classical algorithms run on more than a few qubits. Specifically, we show that for a wide class of reasonable parameterized quantum circuits, the probability that the gradient along any reasonable direction is non-zero to some fixed precision is exponentially small as a function of the number of qubits. We argue that this is related to the 2-design characteristic of random circuits, and that solutions to this problem must be studied.},

The quantum circuit that implements the algorithm consists of unitary gates whose locality is at most the locality of the objective function whose optimum is sought. The depth of the circuit grows linearly with p times (at worst) the number of constraints. If p is fixed, that is, independent of the input size, the algorithm makes use of efficient classical preprocessing. If p grows with the input size a different strategy is proposed. We study the algorithm as applied to MaxCut on regular graphs and analyze its performance on 2-regular and 3-regular graphs for fixed p. For p = 1, on 3-regular graphs the quantum algorithm always finds a cut that is at least 0.6924 times the size of the optimal cut.},

  abstract = {Many quantum algorithms have daunting resource requirements when compared to what is available today. To address this discrepancy, a quantum-classical hybrid optimization scheme known as ‘the quantum variational eigensolver’ was developed (Peruzzo et al 2014 Nat. Commun. 5 4213) with the philosophy that even minimal quantum resources could be made useful when used in conjunction with classical routines. In this work we extend the general theory of this algorithm and suggest algorithmic improvements for practical implementations.

The variational quantum eigensolver, a leading algorithm for molecular simulations on quantum hardware, has a serious limitation in that it typically relies on a pre-selected wavefunction ansatz that results in approximate wavefunctions and energies. Here we present an arbitrarily accurate variational algorithm that, instead of fixing an ansatz upfront, grows it systematically one operator at a time in a way dictated by the molecule being simulated. This generates an ansatz with a small number of parameters, leading to shallow-depth circuits. We present numerical simulations, including for a prototypical strongly correlated molecule, which show that our algorithm performs much better than a unitary coupled cluster approach, in terms of both circuit depth and chemical accuracy. Our results highlight the potential of our adaptive algorithm for exact simulations with present-day and near-term quantum hardware.},

One can obtain a tensor network representation of the ground state using a number of qubits smaller than the physical degrees of freedom. By increasing the qubits number, one can exponentially increase the bond dimension of the tensor network variational ansatz on a quantum computer. Moreover, we construct circuits blocks which respect U(1) and SU(2) symmetries of the physical system and show that they can significantly speed up the training process and alleviate the gradient vanishing problem. To demonstrate the feasibility of the qubit efficient variational quantum eigensolver in a practical setting, we perform first principle classical simulation of differentiable programming of the circuits. Using only \$6\$ qubits one can obtain the ground state of a \$4{\textbackslash}times 4\$ square lattice frustrated Heisenberg model with fidelity over 97\%. Arbitrarily long ranged correlations can also be measured on the same circuit after variational optimization.},

  abstract = {As the advances in quantum hardware bring us into the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, one possible task we can perform without quantum error correction using NISQ machines is the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) due to its shallow depth. A specific problem that we can tackle is the strongly interacting Fermi-Hubbard model, which is classically intractable and has practical implications in areas like superconductivity. In this Article, we outline the details about the gate sequence, the measurement scheme and the relevant error mitigation techniques for the implementation of the Hubbard VQE on a NISQ platform. We perform resource estimation for both silicon spin qubits and superconducting qubits for a 50-qubit simulation, which cannot be solved exactly via classical means, and find similar results. The number of two-qubit gates required is on the order of 20000. Hence, to suppress the mean circuit error count to a level such that we can obtain meaningful results with the aid of error mitigation, we need to achieve a two-qubit gate error rate of \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}\$. When searching for the ground state, we need a few days for one gradient-descent iteration, which is impractical. This can be reduced to around \$10\$ minutes if we distribute our task among hundreds of quantum processing units. Hence, implementing a 50-qubit Hubbard model VQE on a NISQ machine can be on the brink of being feasible in near term, but further optimisation of our simulation scheme, improvements in the gate fidelity, improvements in the optimisation scheme and advances in the error mitigation techniques are needed to overcome the remaining obstacles. The scalability of the hardware platform is also essential to overcome the runtime issue via parallelisation, which can be done on one single silicon multi-core processor or across multiple superconducting processors.},

  abstract = {The preparation of quantum states using short quantum circuits is one of the most promising near-term applications of small quantum computers, especially if the circuit is short enough and the fidelity of gates high enough that it can be executed without quantum error correction. Such quantum state preparation can be used in variational approaches, optimizing parameters in the circuit to minimize the energy of the constructed quantum state for a given problem Hamiltonian. For this purpose we propose a simple-to-implement class of quantum states motivated by adiabatic state preparation. We test its accuracy and determine the required circuit depth for a Hubbard model on ladders with up to 12 sites (24 spin orbitals), and for small molecules. We find that this ansatz converges faster than previously proposed schemes based on unitary coupled clusters. While the required number of measurements is astronomically large for quantum chemistry applications to molecules, applying the variational approach to the Hubbard model (and related models) is found to be far less demanding and potentially practical on small quantum computers. We also discuss another application of quantum state preparation using short quantum circuits, to prepare trial ground states of models faster than using adiabatic state preparation.},

  abstract = {Quantum simulations are bound to be one of the main applications of near-term quantum computers. Quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics are expected to benefit from these technological developments. Several quantum simulation methods are known to prepare a state on a quantum computer and measure the desired observables. The most resource economic procedure is the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), which has traditionally employed unitary coupled cluster as the ansatz to approximate ground states of many-body fermionic Hamiltonians. A significant caveat of the method is that the initial state of the procedure is a single reference product state with no entanglement extracted from a classical Hartree-Fock calculation. In this work, we propose to improve the method by initializing the algorithm with a more general fermionic Gaussian state, an idea borrowed from the field of nuclear physics. We show how this Gaussian reference state can be prepared with a linear-depth circuit of quantum matchgates. By augmenting the set of available gates with nearest-neighbor phase coupling, we generate a low-depth circuit ansatz that can accurately prepare the ground state of correlated fermionic systems. This extends the range of applicability of the VQE to systems with strong pairing correlations such as superconductors, atomic nuclei, and topological materials.},

Both quantities play an important role to understand the properties of a system beyond the naive adiabatic picture, e.g., nonadiabatic dynamics and topological phase of matter. We provide quantum circuits and classical post-processings to calculate the nonadiabatic couplings and Berry's phase. Specifically, we show that the evaluation of the nonadiabatic couplings reduces to that of expectation values of observables while that of Berry's phase also requires one additional Hadamard test. Furthermore, we simulate the photodissociation dynamics of a lithium fluoride molecule using the nonadiabatic couplings evaluated on a real quantum device. Our proposal widens the applicability of the VQE and the possibility of near-term quantum devices to study molecules and quantum many-body systems.},

Experimental realizations have been reported in recent years and theoretical estimates of its efficiency are a subject of intense effort. Here we consider the performance of the VQE technique for a Hubbard-like model describing a one-dimensional chain of fermions with competing nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor interactions. We find that recovering the VQE solution allows one to obtain the correlation function of the ground state consistent with the exact result. We also study the barren plateau phenomenon for the Hamiltonian in question and find that the severity of this effect depends on the encoding of fermions to qubits. Our results are consistent with the current knowledge about the barren plateaus in quantum optimization.},

    "abstract": "We investigated the origin of the identical polarization angle dependences between surface-enhanced resonant Raman scattering (SERRS) and plasmon resonance for two types of single silver nanoparticle aggregates. The first type (Type I), in which the SERRS spectral envelopes are similar to the plasmon resonance elastic scattering spectra, shows the identical polarization dependence between the SERRS and plasmon resonance. The second type (Type II), in which the SERRS envelopes largely deviate from the plasmon resonance, also exhibits identical polarization dependence. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations indicated that these aggregates were dimers. Thus, this unintuitive result was examined by calculating the electromagnetic (EM) enhancement by changing the morphology of the dimers. The calculation revealed that Type I of dimer generates SERRS directly by superradiant plasmons. The Type II of dimer generates SERRS indirectly by subradiant plasmons, which receive light energy from the superradiant plasmons. This indirect SERRS process clarifies that the interaction between the superradiant and subradiant plasmons results in an identical polarization dependence between SERRS and plasmon resonance for Type II of dimers.",

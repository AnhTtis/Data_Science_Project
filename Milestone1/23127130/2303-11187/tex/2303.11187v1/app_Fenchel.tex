\subsection{Fenchel Duality}\label{lem:Fenchel}
By the property of Fenchel Duality, any convex function $f$ can be equivalently written as
\begin{align*}
    f(x)=\sup_{\zeta} x\cdot \zeta - f^*(\zeta),
\end{align*}
where $f^*$ is the Fenchel duality \citep{borwein2006convex}. In case of $f(x)=x^2/2$, the Fenchel duality is given by $f^*(z)=\zeta^2/2$. Therefore, we can equivalently express $\nbr{\cT_k\vh}^2_{\mu_k, 2}$ as 
\begin{align*}
    \nbr{\cT_k\vh}^2_{\mu_k, 2} 
    = \EE_{\mu_k}\sbr{\sup_{\zeta} \cT_k\vh(Z_k) \zeta - \frac 1 2 \zeta^2}.
\end{align*}
Note that the supremum is achieved when $\zeta=\cT_k\vh(Z_k)$.
By assuming $\cT_k\vh\in\Theta_k$, it follows that
\begin{align*}
    \nbr{\cT_k\vh}^2_{\mu_k, 2} 
    = \EE_{\mu_k}\sbr{\sup_{\theta_k\in\Theta_k} \cT_k\vh(Z_k) \theta_k(Z_k) - \frac 1 2 \theta_k(Z_k)^2}.
\end{align*}
Following the interchangeability principle \citep{dai2017learning}, we can therefore swap the position of expectation and supremum and obtain
\begin{align*}
    \nbr{\cT_k\vh}^2_{\mu_k, 2} 
    =\sup_{\theta_k\in\Theta_k} \EE_{\mu_k}\sbr{ \cT_k\vh(Z_k) \theta_k(Z_k) - \frac 1 2 \theta_k(Z_k)^2}.
\end{align*}

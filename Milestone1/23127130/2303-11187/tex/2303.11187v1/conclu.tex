% \label{sec:conclusion}
In this work, we propose a provably efficient algorithm CAP for offline confounded contextual bandit with missing observations.
The essential idea of the CAP algorithm is to (i) form an integration equation system (IES) for identification of the CATE; (ii) reformulate the IES as an unconditional moment minimax estimator and yield the confidence set from the estimator; (iii) Such an uncertainty quantification makes it valid to construct a policy taking greedy pessimistic action.
To the best of our knowledge, CAP is the first pessimism-based algorithm solving the offline confounded contextual bandit with missing observations.

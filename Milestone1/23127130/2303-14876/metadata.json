    "abstract": "Gravitational polarization is examined for equilibrium self-gravitating polytropic sheets perturbed by gravitational field due to test mass sheet. We find equilibrium solutions to the corresponding perturbed Lane-Emden equations for non-negative polytropic indexes. It is shown that gravitational polarization may be observed even in a finite extent of self-gravitating systems in addition to previously discussed infinite systems. In the polytropic sheets, the maximum gravitational amplification gets greater with a higher polytropic index while the height at which the maximum amplification occurs gets lower. The ratio of height change to the original height increases with polytropic index. The last result constrains the linear approximation method used for the present perturbation method.",

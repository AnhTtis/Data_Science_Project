    "abstract": "Innovative ideas are continuously emerging to produce better life conditions where essential human needs are supposed to be fulfilled with perfect scenarios leading us to propose modern strategies drawing the future of smart cities. In this context, flying robots are increasingly exploited in many fields to improve the quality of our life. This paper illustrates new designs of flying robots that could be used to perform a variety of advanced missions like investigating the state of high-power lines and manipulating cabling maintenance procedures when failures are detected, evaluating the state of the outer edge of sidewalks to color their partially or wholly erased parts, and spraying pesticides to trees or crops that are affected by different diseases. Creating such smart devices demands developing many other partial designs relying on AI-based algorithms, computer vision techniques, and embedded systems. A variety of techniques that we have recently developed in this field are presented here.",

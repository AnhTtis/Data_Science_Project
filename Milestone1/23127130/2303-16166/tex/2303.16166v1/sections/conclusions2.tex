%\mg{Our study has shown that, among the different constituents of a scientific work, the quality and correctness of code are often overlooked. Using the widely-used Conformer architecture as a case study, we have empirically demonstrated in multiple tasks and languages that neglecting the quality and correctness of code can lead to the risk of drawing incorrect or misleading conclusions. To address this issue, we have proposed a Correctness Checklist to encourage researchers to adopt coding best practices, and ultimately improve the quality and correctness of research codebases in the NLP community.}

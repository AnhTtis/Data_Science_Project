    "abstract": "The problem of the structure of nucleons and their interaction in the concept of nonperturbative QCD is discussed as an approach to studying the transformation of current quarks into constituent ones and the search for the mechanism of such a transformation, creating the bulk of the nucleon mass. Attention is drawn to the possibilities offered by studying central nucleon-nucleon collisions in this aspect.",

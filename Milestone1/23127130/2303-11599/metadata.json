    "abstract": "Prevalent predictive coding-based video compression methods rely on a heavy encoder to reduce the temporal redundancy, which makes it challenging to deploy them on resource-constrained devices. Meanwhile, as early as the 1970s, distributed source coding theory has indicated that independent encoding and joint decoding with side information (SI) can achieve high-efficient compression of correlated sources. This has inspired a distributed coding architecture aiming at reducing the encoding complexity. However, traditional distributed coding methods suffer from a substantial performance gap to predictive coding ones. Inspired by the great success of learning-based compression, we propose the first end-to-end distributed deep video compression framework to improve the rate-distortion performance. A key ingredient is an effective SI generation module at the decoder, which helps to effectively exploit inter-frame correlations without computation-intensive encoder-side motion estimation and compensation. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms conventional distributed video coding and H.264. Meanwhile, it enjoys 6-7x encoding speedup against DVC [1] with comparable compression performance. Code is released at https://github.com/Xinjie-Q/Distributed-DVC.",

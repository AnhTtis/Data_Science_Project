In this paper, we presented a visual servoing method based on the 3D spectral domain registration using point clouds. The presented approach makes use of the Fourier shift property to estimate translations, and the real spherical harmonics on $\bm{SO(3)}$ to estimate rotations, in order to iteratively align a reference point cloud on to a target one. This methodology has been initially used to align 3D models on to different scenes represented as point clouds, and later used to control the end-effector position of a robot arm to accomplish a planar positioning task. The obtained experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of our approach in terms of aligning a 3D model under complex conditions as well in positioning  the robot arm. 

Future work is concentrated on using the proposed approach and perform a full scale 3D object manipulation involving static and moving object grasping \cite{adjigble2021spectgrasp,de2021dual}.

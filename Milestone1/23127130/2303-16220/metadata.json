    "abstract": "In this paper we generalize previous work on decomposition in three-dimensional orbifolds by 2-groups realized as analogues of central extensions, to orbifolds by more general 2-groups. We describe the computation of such orbifolds in physics, state a version of the decomposition conjecture, and then compute in numerous examples, checking that decomposition works as advertised.",

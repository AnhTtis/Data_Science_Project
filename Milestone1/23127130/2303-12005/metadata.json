    "abstract": "Let $X$ be the blowup of $\\mathbb{P}^3$ at eight very general points. We give a complete description of its nef and effective cones. Moreover, we show that there exists a rational polyhedral fundamental domain for the action of a certain Weyl group on the effective movable cone of $X$.",

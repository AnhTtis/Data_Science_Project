    "abstract": "Unforeseen particle accelerator interruptions, also known as interlocks, lead to abrupt operational changes despite being necessary safety measures. These may result in substantial loss of beam time and perhaps even equipment damage. We propose a simple yet powerful binary classification model aiming to forecast such interruptions, in the case of the High Intensity Proton Accelerator complex at the Paul Scherrer Institut. The model is formulated as logistic regression penalized by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, based on a statistical two sample test to distinguish between unstable and stable states of the accelerator.\n  The primary objective for receiving alarms prior to interlocks is to allow for countermeasures and reduce beam time loss. Hence, a continuous evaluation metric is developed to measure the saved beam time in any period, given the assumption that interlocks could be circumvented by reducing the beam current. The best-performing interlock-to-stable classifier can potentially increase the beam time by around 5 min in a day. Possible instrumentation for fast adjustment of the beam current is also listed and discussed.",

In such situations, communication dynamics can be complex as team discourse segments can happen in parallel at different locations of the physical space with varied team member configurations. This can make it hard for teachers to assess the effectiveness of teamwork and for students to reflect on their own experiences. To address this problem, we propose METS (Multimodal Embodied Teamwork Signature), a method to model team dialogue content in combination with spatial and temporal data to generate a signature of embodied teamwork. We present a study in the context of a highly dynamic healthcare team simulation space where students can freely move. We illustrate how signatures of embodied teamwork can help to identify key differences between high and low performing teams: i) across the whole learning session; ii) at different phases of learning sessions; and iii) at particular spaces of interest in the learning space.}, booktitle = {LAK23: 13th International Learning Analytics and Knowledge Conference}, pages = {186–196}, numpages = {11}, keywords = {Healthcare simulation, Teamwork, Collaborative learning, Communication, Multimodality}, location = {Arlington, TX, USA}, series = {LAK2023}

abstract = {Significant progress to integrate and analyse multimodal data has been carried out in the last years. Yet, little research has tackled the challenge of visualising and supporting the sensemaking of multimodal data to inform teaching and learning. It is na\"{\i}ve to expect that simply by rendering multiple data streams visually, a teacher or learner will be able to make sense of them. This paper introduces an approach to unravel the complexity of multimodal data by organising it into meaningful layers that explain critical insights to teachers and students. The approach is illustrated through the design of two data storytelling prototypes in the context of nursing simulation. Two authentic studies with educators and students identified the potential of the approach to create learning analytics interfaces that communicate insights on team performance, as well as concerns in terms of accountability and automated insights discovery.},

abstract = {In recent years, AI explainability (XAI) has received wide attention. Although XAI is expected to play a positive role in decision-making and advice acceptance, various opposing effects have also been found. The opposing effects of XAI highlight the critical role of context, especially human factors, in understanding XAI's impacts. This study investigates the effects of providing three types of post-hoc explanations (alternative advice, prediction confidence scores, and prediction rationale) on two context-specific user decision-making outcomes (AI advice acceptance and advice adoption). Our field experiment results show that users’ epistemic uncertainty matters when understanding XAI's impacts. As users’ epistemic uncertainty increases, only providing prediction rationale is beneficial, whereas providing alternative advice and showing prediction confidence scores may hinder users’ advice acceptance. Our study contributes to the emerging literature on the human aspects of XAI by clarifying XAI and showing that XAI may not always be desirable. It also contributes by highlighting the importance of considering user profiles when predicting XAI's impacts, designing XAI, and providing professional services with AI.}

abstract = {Social media have been extensively incorporated in higher education as an indispensable tool for learning. Nevertheless, research has conflicting findings about its effectiveness due to the highly reported digital distraction and poor peer learning engagement on social media. This study employed an innovative problem-based learning (PBL) pedagogy incorporating Learning Analytics to identify digital distraction, quantify the quality of peer learning engagement, and predict learning performance. Participants were 51 Taiwanese graduate students in blended Statistics courses under the PBL pedagogy. The multimodal Learning Analytics (LA) model contained data from learner discourse on Facebook groups and questionnaires, including learner characteristics, perceived digital distraction, subjective peer learning orientation, and objective peer learning engagement endorsed by machine learning (ML) models. Results showed that students reporting more digital distraction problems obtained lower final course grades, and those reporting stronger peer learning orientation received higher final course grades. Moreover, peer learning engagement objectively recognized by ML models has better predictive validity on academic performance than self-perceived peer learning orientation. The results of the multimodal LA models addressed the scarcity of studies involving learners' process data in PBL and informed instructional practices and strategies to scaffold students’ statistics learning upon detecting those at risk of distracted attention problems and poor peer learning engagement.}

In this special issue of Computers in Human Behavior, we report six studies conducted by interdisciplinary teams’ use of various trace methodologies such as eye tracking, log-files, physiological data, facial expressions of emotions, screen recordings, concurrent think-alouds, and linguistic analyses of discourse. The research studies focus on how these data were analyzed using a combination of traditional statistical techniques as well as educational data-mining procedures to detect, measure, and infer cognitive, metacognitive, and social processes related to regulating the self and others across several tasks, domains, ages, and contexts. The results of these studies point to future work necessitating interdisciplinary researchers’ collaboration to use theoretically based and empirically derived approaches to collecting, measuring, and modeling multimodal multichannel SRL data to extend our current models, frameworks, and theories by making them more predictive by elucidating the nature, complexity, and temporality of underlying processes. Lastly, analyses of multimodal multichannel SRL process data can significantly augment advanced learning technologies by providing real-time, intelligent, adaptive, individualized scaffolding and feedback to address learners’ self-regulatory needs.}

abstract="There is a growing interest in the research and use of multimodal data in learning analytics. This paper presents a systematic literature review of multimodal learning analytics (MMLA) research to assess (i) the available evidence of impact on learning outcomes in real-world contexts and (ii) explore the extent to which ethical considerations are addressed. A few recent literature reviews argue for the promising value of multimodal data in learning analytics research. However, our understanding of the challenges associated with MMLA research from real-world teaching and learning environments is limited. To address this gap, this paper provides an overview of the evidence of impact and ethical considerations stemming from an analysis of the relevant MMLA research published in the last decade. The search of the literature resulted in 663 papers, of which 100 were included in the final synthesis. The results show that the evidence of real-world impact on learning outcomes is weak, and ethical challenges of MMLA work are rarely addressed. In this paper, we discuss the results through the lenses of two theoretical frameworks (1) evidence of impact types and (2) ethical dimensions of MMLA. We conclude that for MMLA to stay relevant and become part of mainstream education, future research should directly address the gaps identified in this review.",

abstract = {HCI engages with data science through many topics and themes. Researchers have addressed biased dataset problems, arguing that bad data can cause innocent software to produce bad outcomes. But what if our software is not so innocent? What if the human decisions that shape our data-processing software, inadvertently contribute their own sources of bias? And what if our data-work technology causes us to forget those decisions and operations? Based in feminisms and critical computing, we analyze forgetting practices in data work practices. We describe diverse beneficial and harmful motivations for forgetting. We contribute: (1) a taxonomy of data silences in data work, which we use to analyze how data workers forget, erase, and unknow aspects of data; (2) a detailed analysis of forgetting practices in machine learning; and (3) an analytic vocabulary for future work in remembering, forgetting, and erasing in HCI and the data sciences.},

abstract = {In co-located situations, team members use a combination of verbal and visual signals to communicate effectively, among which positional forms play a key role. The spatial patterns adopted by team members in terms of where in the physical space they are standing, and who their body is oriented to, can be key in analysing and increasing the quality of interaction during such face-to-face situations. In this paper, we model the students’ communication based on spatial (positioning) and audio (voice detection) data captured from 92 students working in teams of four in the context of healthcare simulation. We extract non-verbal events (i.e., total speaking time, overlapped speech,and speech responses to team members and teachers) and investigate to what extent they can serve as meaningful indicators of students’ performance according to teachers’ learning intentions. The contribution of this paper to multimodal learning analytics includes: i) a generic method to semi-automatically model communication in a setting where students can freely move in the learning space; and ii) results from a mixed-methods analysis of non-verbal indicators of team communication with respect to teachers’ learning design.},

This chapter discusses the use of Internet of things (IoT) data collected through various digital devices and emerging learning platforms to shape learning activities and to increase learning gains. It briefly addresses the theoretical bases of IoT and the types of IoT data in education. Then it goes on to provide an overview of practical ways, in which such data can help individualize learning and improve learning gains. Moreover, some studies on learner analytics through IoT data have already been underway, so this chapter provides a brief overview of the results obtained from these studies. It also discusses possible challenges involved in collection, analysis, safe and reliable storage and sense-making of the data for purposes of learning analytics, along with possible ethical considerations. Finally, based on such challenges and concerns, the chapter offers potential avenues for further research.",

Here, we consider a hidden assumption derived from computer science, namely, that improving computational accuracy in classification is always a worthy goal. We demonstrate that this assumption is unlikely to hold in some important educational contexts, and argue that embracing computational "imperfection" can improve outcomes for those scenarios. Specifically, we show that learner-facing approaches aimed at "learning how to learn" require more holistic validation strategies. We consider what information must be provided in order to reasonably evaluate algorithmic tools in LA, to facilitate transparency and realistic performance comparisons.},

abstract = {Collocated, face-to-face teamwork remains a pervasive mode of working, which is hard to replicate online. Team members' embodied, multimodal interaction with each other and artefacts has been studied by researchers, but due to its complexity, has remained opaque to automated analysis. However, the ready availability of sensors makes it increasingly affordable to instrument work spaces to study teamwork and groupwork. The possibility of visualising key aspects of a collaboration has huge potential for both academic and professional learning, but a frontline challenge is the enrichment of quantitative data streams with the qualitative insights needed to make sense of them. In response, we introduce the concept of collaboration translucence, an approach to make visible selected features of group activity. This is grounded both theoretically (in the physical, epistemic, social and affective dimensions of group activity), and contextually (using domain-specific concepts). We illustrate the approach from the automated analysis of healthcare simulations to train nurses, generating four visual proxies that fuse multimodal data into higher order patterns.},

Through documentation of our design experience, we offer ways to adapt common HCD methods — contextual design and design tensions — when developing visual analytics systems for educators. We also illuminate how adopting these design methods within the context of improvement science and research–practice partnerships fundamentally influences the design choices we make and the focal questions we undertake.

abstract = {This paper presents a summary and critical reflection on ten major opportunities and challenges for advancing the field of multimodal learning analytics (MLA). It identifies emerging technology trends likely to disrupt learning analytics, challenges involved in forging viable participatory design partnerships, and impending issues associated with the control of data and privacy. Trends in health care analytics provide one attractive model for how new infrastructure can enable the collection of largerscale and more diverse datasets, and how end-user analytics can be designed to empower individuals and expand market adoption.},

abstract = {There is a proliferation of learning analytics (LA) dashboards aimed at supporting teachers. Yet, teachers still find it challenging to make sense of LA dashboards, thereby making informed decisions. Two main strategies to address this are emerging: i) upskilling teachers’ data literacy; ii) improving the explanatory design features of current dashboards (e.g., adding visual cues or text) to minimise the skills required by teachers to effectively use dashboards. While each approach has its own trade-offs, no previous work has explored the interplay between the dashboard design and such "data skills". In this paper, we explore how teachers with varying visualisation literacy (VL) skills use LA dashboards enhanced with (explanatory) data storytelling elements. We conducted a quasi-experimental study with 23 teachers of varied VL inspecting two versions of an authentic multichannel dashboard enhanced with data storytelling elements. We used an eye-tracking device while teachers inspected the students’ data captured from Zoom and Google Docs, followed by interviews. Results suggest that high VL teachers adopted complex exploratory strategies and were more sensitive to subtle inconsistencies in the design; while low VL teachers benefited the most from more explicit data storytelling guidance such as accompanying complex graphs with narrative and semantic colour encoding.},

abstract = {We explore the ethical implications of HCI's turn to the ‘cultural’. This is motivated by an awareness of how cultural applications, in our case interactive performances, raise ethical issues that may challenge established research ethics processes. We review research ethics, HCI's engagement with ethics and the ethics of theatrical performance. Following an approach grounded in Responsible Research Innovation, we present the findings from a workshop in which artists, curators, commissioners, and researchers explored ethical challenges revealed by four case studies. We identify six ethical challenges for HCI's engagement with cultural applications: transgression, boundaries, consent, withdrawal, data, and integrity. We discuss two broader implications of these: managing tensions between multiple overlapping ethical frames; and the importance of managing ethical challenges during and after an experience as well as beforehand. Finally, we discuss how our findings extend previous discussions of Value Sensitive Design in HCI.},

abstract = {Learning Analytics (LA) dashboards have become a popular medium for communicating to teachers analytical insights obtained from student data. However, recent research indicates that LA dashboards can be complex to interpret, are often not grounded in educational theory, and frequently provide little or no guidance on how to interpret them. Despite these acknowledged problems, few suggestions have been made as to how we might improve the visual design of LA tools to support richer and alternative ways to communicate student data insights. In this paper, we explore three design alternatives to represent student multimodal data insights by combining data visualisation, narratives and storytelling principles. Based on foundations in data storytelling, three visual-narrative interfaces were designed with teachers: i) visual data slices, ii) a tabular visualisation, and iii) a written report. These were validated as a part of an authentic study where teachers explored activity logs and physiological data from co-located collaborative learning classes in the context of healthcare education. Results suggest that alternatives to LA dashboards can be considered as effective tools to support teachers’ reflection, and that LA designers should identify the representation type that best fits teachers’ needs.},

abstract = {The proliferation of computing into the physical world promises more than the ubiquitous availability of computing infrastructure; it suggest new paradigms of interaction inspired by constant access to information and computational capabilities. For the past decade, application-driven research on abiquitous computing (ubicomp) has pushed three interaction themes:natural interfaces, context-aware applications,andautomated capture and access. To chart a course for future research in ubiquitous computing, we review the accomplishments of these efforts and point to remaining research challenges. Research in ubiquitious computing implicitly requires addressing some notion of scale, whether in the number and type of devices, the physical space of distributed computing, or the number of people using a system. We posit a new area of applications research, everyday computing, focussed on scaling interaction with respect to time. Just as pushing the availiability of computing away from the traditional desktop fundamentally changes the relationship between humans and computers, providing continuous interaction moves computing from a localized tool to a constant companion. Designing for continous interaction requires addressing interruption and reumption of intreaction, representing passages of time and providing associative storage models. Inherent in all of these interaction themes are difficult issues in the social implications of ubiquitous computing and the challenges of evaluating&gt; ubiquitious computing research. Although cumulative experience points to lessons in privacy, security, visibility, and control, there are no simple guidelines for steering research efforts. Akin to any efforts involving new technologies, evaluation strategies form a spectrum from technology feasibility efforts to long-term use studies—but a user-centric perspective is always possible and necessary},

abstract = {In this study, we investigated the way users memorize, analyze, collaborate, and learn new concepts on a Tangible User Interface (TUI). Twenty-seven pairs of apprentices in logistics (N = 54) interacted with an interactive simulation of a warehouse. Their task was to discover efficient design principles for building storehouses. In a between-subjects experimental design, half of the participants used 3D physical shelves, whereas the other half used 2D paper shelves. This manipulation allowed us to control for the “representational effect” of 3D tangibles: the first group saw the warehouse as a small-scale model with realistic shelves, whereas the second group had access to a more abstract layout with rectangular pieces of paper. Both groups interacted with the system in the same way. We found that participants in the first group (i.e., who used 3D realistic shelves) better memorized a warehouse layout, built a more efficient model, and scored higher on a learning test. Additionally, students wore eye-tracking goggles while completing those tasks; preliminary results suggest that 3D interfaces increased joint visual attention, which was found to be a significant predictor for participants’ task performance and learning gains. Implications for designing TUIs in collaborative settings are discussed.},

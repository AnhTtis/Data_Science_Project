\section{Conclusion}
Multimodal learning analytics have the potential to open exciting new avenues for supporting teachers and learners, with multiple caveats. In this paper, we have explored some of the challenges that emerged in a MMLA study conducted in-the-wild. Some of these can be addressed by improving the design and logistics of the study and adapting current educational practices. Yet, other challenges require a human-centred perspective to design for the ethical use of sensing and analytics technologies. This paper should be seen as an initial stepping stone of much more work aimed at generating a deeper understanding of effective practices to deploy sensing and MMLA technologies in authentic learning situations with integrity.

Previous disk reliability studies have analyzed empirical data in an attempt to better understand and predict disk failure rates. Yet, very little is known about the incidence of latent sector errors i.e., errors that go undetected until the corresponding disk sectors are accessed.Our study analyzes data collected from production storage systems over 32 months across 1.53 million disks (both nearline and enterprise class). We analyze factors that impact latent sector errors, observe trends, and explore their implications on the design of reliability mechanisms in storage systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of such large scale our sample size is at least anorder of magnitude larger than previously published studies and the first one to focus specifically on latent sector errors and their implications on the design and reliability of storage systems.},

	abstract     = {Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have become competitive forecasting methods, as most notably shown in the winning method of the recent M4 competition. However, established statistical models such as exponential smoothing (ETS) and the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) gain their popularity not only from their high accuracy, but also because they are suitable for non-expert users in that they are robust, efficient, and automatic. In these areas, RNNs have still a long way to go. We present an extensive empirical study and an open-source software framework of existing RNN architectures for forecasting, and we develop guidelines and best practices for their use. For example, we conclude that RNNs are capable of modelling seasonality directly if the series in the dataset possess homogeneous seasonal patterns; otherwise, we recommend a deseasonalisation step. Comparisons against ETS and ARIMA demonstrate that (semi-) automatic RNN models are not silver bullets, but they are nevertheless competitive alternatives in many situations.}

	abstract     = {Abstract The multivariate analysis of congruent images (MACI) is discussed. Here, each image represents one observation and the data set contains a set of congruent images. With ‘congruent images’ we mean a set of images, properly pre-processed, oriented and aligned, so that each data element (‘feature’, pixel) corresponds to the same element across all images. An example may be a set of frames from a fixed video camera looking at a stable process. The purpose of a MACI is to find and express patterns over a set of images for the purpose of classification or quantitative regression-like relationships. This is in contrast to standard image analysis, which is usually concerned with a single image and the identification of parts of the image, for example tumour tissue versus normal. We also extend MACI to the case with a set of images that initially are not fully congruent, but are made so by the use of wavelet analysis and the distributions of the wavelet coefficients. Thus, the resulting description forms a set of congruent vectors amenable to multivariate data analysis. The MACI approach will be illustrated by four data sets, three easy-to-understand tutorial image data sets and one industrial image data set relating to quality control of steel rolls.

Predicting disk failure from observable disk attributes, such as those provided by the Self-Monitoring and Reporting Technology (SMART) system, has been shown to be effective. In the paper, we treat SMART data as time series, and explore the prediction power by using HMM- and HSMM-based approaches. Our experimental results show that our prediction models outperform other models that do not capture the temporal relationship among attribute values over time. Using the best single attribute, our approach can achieve a detection rate of 46{\%} at 0{\%} false alarm. Combining the two best attributes, our approach can achieve a detection rate of 52{\%} at 0{\%} false alarm.}

abstract = {This paper focuses on building a spatio-temporal AI inference engine for estimating hard disk reliability. Most electronic systems such as hard disks routinely collect such reliability parameters in the field to monitor the health of the system. Changes in parameters as a function of time are monitored and any observed changes are compared with the known failure signatures. If the trajectory of the measured data matches that of a failure signature, operators are alerted to take corrective action. However, the interest of the operators lies in being able to identify the failures before they occur. The state of the art methodology including our prior work is to train machine learning models on temporal sequence data capturing the variations across multiple features and using it to predict the remaining useful life of the devices. However, as we show in this paper temporal prediction capability alone is not sufficient and can lead to low precision and the uncertainty around the prediction is very large. This is primarily due to the non-uniform progression of feature patterns over time. Our hypothesis is that the accuracy can be improved if we combine the temporal prediction methods with a spatial analysis that compares the value of key SMART features of the devices across similar model in a fixed time window (unlike the temporal method which uses the data from a single device and a much larger historical window). In this paper, we first describe both temporal and spatial approaches, describe the methods to select various hyperparameters, and then show a workflow to combine these two methodologies and provide comparative results. Our results illustrate that the average precision of temporal methods using long-short temporal memory networks to predict impending failures in the next ten days was 84 percent. To improve precision, we use the set of disks identified as potential failures and start applying spatial anomaly detection methods on those disks. This helps us remove the false positives from the temporal prediction results and provide a tighter bound on the set of disks with impending failure.}

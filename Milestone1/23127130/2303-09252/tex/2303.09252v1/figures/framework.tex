   \caption{The pipeline of our proposed GridCLIP. GridCLIP aligns to the CLIP representation in both image and grid levels. In image-level alignment, the image-level feature is aligned to the feature generated by a fixed CLIP image encoder. In grid-level alignment, the grid-level feature is aligned to the classification target generated from the ground truth labels and bounding boxes following the detector FCOS~\cite{tian2019fcos}. Note that the grid-level alignment is performed in multiple scales, while only one scale is presented here for simplicity.    \label{framework}}

    "abstract": "Crash data of autonomous vehicles (AV) or vehicles equipped with advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) are the key information to understand the crash nature and to enhance the automation systems. However, most of the existing crash data sources are either limited by the sample size or suffer from missing or unverified data. To contribute to the AV safety research community, we introduce AVOID: an open AV crash dataset. Three types of vehicles are considered: Advanced Driving System (ADS) vehicles, Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) vehicles, and low-speed autonomous shuttles. The crash data are collected from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), California Department of Motor Vehicles (CA DMV) and incident news worldwide, and the data are manually verified and summarized in ready-to-use format. In addition, land use, weather, and geometry information are also provided. The dataset is expected to accelerate the research on AV crash analysis and potential risk identification by providing the research community with data of rich samples, diverse data sources, clear data structure, and high data quality.",

    "abstract": "Let $M$ be a von Neumann algebra equipped with a normal semi-finite faithful trace (nsf trace in short) and let $T\\colon M\\to M$ be a contraction. We say that $T$ is absolutely dilatable if there exist another von Neumann algebra $M'$ equipped with a nsf trace, a $w^*$-continuous trace preserving unital $*$-homomorphim $J\\colon M\\to M'$ and a trace preserving $*$-automomorphim $U\\colon M'\\to M'$ such that $T^k=E U^k J$ for all integer $k\\geq 0$, where $E\\colon M'\\to M$ is the conditional expectation associated with $J$. Given a $σ$-finite measure space $(Ω,μ)$, we characterize bounded Schur multipliers $φ\\in L^\\infty(Ω^2)$ such that the Schur multiplication operator $T_φ\\colon B(L^2(Ω))\\to B(L^2(Ω))$ is absolutely dilatable. In the separable case, they are characterized by the existence of a von Neumann algebra $N$ with a separable predual, equipped with a normalized normal faithful trace $τ_N$, and of a $w^*$-continuous essentially bounded function $d\\colonΩ\\to N$ such that $φ(s,t)=τ_N(d(s)^*d(t))$ for almost every $(s,t)\\inΩ^2$.",

\begin{itemize} \item \textbf{What was the main research question or hypothesis of your study?}

The main research question of our study was how different gaze strategies and facial expressions of a robot observer affect human-human cooperation and perception of the robot’s intelligence.

\item \textbf{How did you measure the cooperation level between the human pairs?}

We measured the cooperation level between the human pairs by using their total response time for completing 10 rounds of a shape sorting task as an indicator of their coordination and efficiency.

\item \textbf{What were the main findings or implications of your study?}

The main findings of our study were that human pairs cooperated better when the robot observer displayed congruent gaze and facial expressions with their task performance, and that they rated the robot as more intelligent when it showed more varied and expressive emotions.

\item \textbf{How did the iCub robot’s emotional expressions influence the human participants’ behavior and perception?}

The iCub robot’s emotional expressions influenced the human participants’ behavior and perception by providing them with feedback, encouragement, empathy, and social cues that enhanced their motivation, engagement, trust, and rapport with both the robot and their partner.

\item \textbf{How does your study contribute to the field of human-robot interaction?}

Our study contributes to the field of human-robot interaction by demonstrating how a robot observer can modulate human-human cooperation through its gaze and facial expressions, and by exploring how humans perceive a robot’s intelligence based on its emotional displays. \end{itemize}

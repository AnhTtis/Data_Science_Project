    "abstract": "In this paper we identify, for small $t$ and a fixed $T>0,$ the order $α>0$ in the abstract fractional differential equation $$\\partial^αu(t)=Au(t),$$ where the time-fractional derivative $\\partial^α$ is understood in the sense of Caputo and Riemann-Liouville, $A$ is a closed (possibly unbounded) linear operator in a Banach space $X,$ and $0<α<1$ or $1<α<2.$",

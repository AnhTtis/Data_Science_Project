@article{Bobbio2001,
abstract = {Bayesian Networks (BN) provide a robust probabilistic method of reasoning under uncertainty. They have been successfully applied in a variety of real-world tasks but they have received little attention in the area of dependability. The present paper is aimed at exploring the capabilities of the BN formalism in the analysis of dependable systems. To this end, the paper compares BN with one of the most popular techniques for dependability analysis of large, safety critical systems, namely Fault Trees (FT). The paper shows that any FT can be directly mapped into a BN and that basic inference techniques on the latter may be used to obtain classical parameters computed from the former (i.e. reliability of the Top Event or of any sub-system, criticality of components, etc). Moreover, by using BN, some additional power can be obtained, both at the modeling and at the analysis level. At the modeling level, several restrictive assumptions implicit in the FT methodology can be removed and various kinds of dependencies among components can be accommodated. At the analysis level, a general diagnostic analysis can be performed. The comparison of the two methodologies is carried out by means of a running example, taken from the literature, that consists of a redundant multiprocessor system.},

abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

@phdthesis{Fuentes2017,
abstract = {The first step in data-driven approaches to Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is that of damage detection. This is a problem that has been well studied in laboratory conditions. Yet, SHM remains an academic topic, not yet widely implemented in industry. One of the main reasons for this is arguably the difficulty in dealing with Environmental and Operational Variabilities (EOVs), which have a tendency to influence damage-sensitive features in ways similar to damage itself. A large number of the methods developed for SHM applications make use of linear Gaussian models for various tasks including dimensionality reduction, density estimation and system identification. A wide range of linear Gaussian models can be formulated as special cases of a general class of probabilistic graphical models, or Bayesian networks. The work presented here discusses how Bayesian networks can be used systematically to approach different types of damage detection problems, through their likelihood function. A likelihood evaluates the probability that an observation belongs to a particular model. If this model correctly captures the undamaged state of the system, then a likelihood can be used as a novelty index, which can point to the presence of damage. Likelihood functions can be systematically exploited for damage detection purposes across the vast range of linear Gaussian models. One of the key benefits of this fact is that simple models can easily be extended to mixtures of linear Gaussian models. It is shown how this approach can be effective in dealing with operational and environmental variabilities. This thesis thus provides a point of view on performing novelty detection under this wide class of models systematically with their likelihood functions. Models that are typically used for other purposes can become powerful novelty detectors in this view. The relationship between Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Kalman filters is a good example of this. Under the graphical model perspective these two models are a simple variation of each other, where they model data with and without time dependence. Provided these models are trained with representative data from a non-damaged system, their likelihood function presents a useful novelty index. Their limitation to modelling linear Gaussian data can be overcome through the mixture modelling interpretation. Through graphical models, this is a straightforward extension, but one that retains a probabilistic interpretation. The impact of this interpretation is that environmental and operational variability, as well as potential nonlinearity, in SHM features can be captured by these models. Even though the interpretation changes depending on the model, the likelihood function can consistently be used as a damage indicator, throughout models like Gaussian mixtures, PCA, Factor Analysis, Autoregressive models, Kalman filters and switching Kalman filters. The work here focuses around these models. There are various ways in which these models can be used, but here the focus is narrowed to exploring them as novelty detectors, and showing their application in different contexts. The context in this case refers to different types of SHM data and features, as this could be either vibration, acoustics, ultrasound, performance metrics, etc. {\%}The thesis divides into three main sections. The first presents an overview and scope, with introductions to SHM data, machine learning and the use of likelihood functions for novelty detection. This thesis provides a discussion on the theoretical background for probabilistic graphical models, or Bayesian networks. Separate chapters are dedicated to the discussion of Bayesian networks to model static and dynamic data (with and without temporal dependencies, respectively). Furthermore, three different application examples are presented to demonstrate the use of likelihood function inference for damage detection. These systems are a simulated mass-spring-damper system, with varying stiffness in its non-damaged condition, and with a cubic spring nonlinearity. This system presents a challenge from the point of view of the characterisation of the changing environment in terms of global stiffness and excitation energy. It is shown how mixtures of PCA models can be used to tackle this problem if frequency domain features are used, and mixtures of linear dynamical systems (Kalman filters) can be used to successfully characterise the baseline undamaged system and to identify the presence of damage directly from time domain measurements. Another case study involves the detection of damage on the Z-24 bridge. This is a well-studied problem in SHM research, and it is of interest due to the nonlinear stiffness effect due to temperature changes. The features used here are the first four natural frequencies of the bridge. It is demonstrated how a Gaussian mixture model can characterise the undamaged condition, and its likelihood is able to accurately predict the presence of damage. The third case study involves the prediction of various stages of damage on a wind turbine bearing. This is an experimental laboratory investigation - and the problem is also tackled with a Gaussian mixture model. This problem is of interest because the lowest damage level seeded in the bearing was subsurface yield. This is of great relevance to the wind turbine community, as detecting this level of damage is currently not feasible. Features from Acoustic Emission (AE) measurements were used to train a Gaussian mixture model. It is shown that the likelihood function of this model can correctly predict the presence of damage.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a novel approach for optimal sensor and/or actuator placement for structural health monitoring (SHM) applications. Starting from a general formulation of Bayes risk, we derive a global optimality criterion within a detection theory framework. The optimal configuration is then established as the one that minimizes the expected total presence of either type I or type II error during the damage detection process. While the approach is suitable for many sensing/actuation SHM processes, we focus on the example of active sensing using guided ultrasonic waves by implementing an appropriate statistical model of the wave propagation and feature extraction process. This example implements both pulse-echo and pitch-catch actuation schemes and takes into account line-of-site visibility and non-uniform damage probabilities over the monitored structure. The optimization space is searched using a genetic algorithm with a time-varying mutation rate. We provide three actuator/sensor placement test problems and discuss the optimal solutions generated by the algorithm. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses 'value networks' to evaluate board positions and 'policy networks' to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8{\%} winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away.},

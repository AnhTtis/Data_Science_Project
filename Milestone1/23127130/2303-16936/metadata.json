    "abstract": "We complement previous studies of an ion coupled with an optical cavity in the dispersive regime, for a model which exhibits bistability of different configurations in the semiclassical description. Our approach is based on a truncated evolution in phase space and is intended to explore an especially interesting parameter region where the fully quantum-mechanical solution becomes hard but the crudest semiclassical approach fails to capture essential phenomena. We compare the results of our techniques with the ones from numerical diagonalization of the quantum evolution and find that although the treatment leads to a smoothening and a slight shift of the transitions in the system, it still provides a clear improvement over localized semiclassical approximations.",

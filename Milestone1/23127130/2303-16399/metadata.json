    "abstract": "Consider the eigenvalue problem of a linear second order elliptic operator:\n  \\begin{equation}\n  \\nonumber\n  -DΔ\\varphi -2α\\nabla m(x)\\cdot \\nabla\\varphi+V(x)\\varphi=λ\\varphi\\ \\ \\hbox{ in }Ω, \\end{equation} complemented by the Dirichlet boundary condition or the following general Robin boundary condition:\n  $$\n  \\frac{\\partial\\varphi}{\\partial n}+β(x)\\varphi=0 \\ \\ \\hbox{ on }\\partialΩ,\n  $$ where $Ω\\subset\\mathbb{R}^N (N\\geq1)$ is a bounded smooth domain, $n(x)$ is the unit exterior normal to $\\partialΩ$ at $x\\in\\partialΩ$, $D>0$ and $α>0$ are, respectively, the diffusion and advection coefficients, $m\\in C^2(\\overlineΩ),\\,V\\in C(\\overlineΩ)$, $β\\in C(\\partialΩ)$ are given functions, and $β$ allows to be positive, sign-changing or negative.\n  In \\cite{PZZ2019}, the asymptotic behavior of the principal eigenvalue of the above eigenvalue problem as $D\\to0$ or $D\\to\\infty$ was studied. In this paper, when $N\\geq2$, under proper conditions on the advection function $m$, we establish the asymptotic behavior of the principal eigenvalue as $α\\to\\infty$, and when $N=1$, we obtain a complete characterization for such asymptotic behavior provided $m'$ changes sign at most finitely many times. Our results complement or improve those in \\cite{BHN2005,CL2008,PZ2018} and also partially answer some questions raised in \\cite{BHN2005}.",

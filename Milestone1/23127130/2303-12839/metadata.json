    "abstract": "The real- and imaginary-time evolution of quantum states are powerful tools in physics and chemistry to investigate quantum dynamics, prepare ground states or calculate thermodynamic observables. They also find applications in wider fields such as quantum machine learning or optimization. On near-term devices, variational quantum time evolution is a promising candidate for these tasks, as the required circuit model can be tailored to trade off available device capabilities and approximation accuracy. However, even if the circuits can be reliably executed, variational quantum time evolution algorithms quickly become infeasible for relevant system sizes. They require the calculation of the Quantum Geometric Tensor and its complexity scales quadratically with the number of parameters in the circuit. In this work, we propose a solution to this scaling problem by leveraging a dual formulation that circumvents the explicit evaluation of the Quantum Geometric Tensor. We demonstrate our algorithm for the time evolution of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian and show that it accurately reproduces the system dynamics at a fraction of the cost of standard variational quantum time evolution algorithms. As an application, we calculate thermodynamic observables with the QMETTS algorithm.",

    "abstract": "This project contains two chapters. Chapter 2 has two sections. First, we define the well-formed formulas of the Language of Sentential Logic using Construction Sequences. Second, we prove the Truth Assignments using the Language of Sentential Logic. Chapter 3 has two sections. First, we define the Recursion Theorem. Second, we prove the Truth Assignments using a general formulation of the Recursion Theorem.",

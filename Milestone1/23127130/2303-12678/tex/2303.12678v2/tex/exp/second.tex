\subsection{Results for 2D-to-3D transfer}

In addition to surface and color, Uni-Fusion also allows continuous mapping of other fabricated data.
%
Therefore, we apply Uni-Fusion to style data and saliency data in order to achieve style and saliency transfer on the 3D canvas.

In~\cref{fig:style}, we present artistic painting on the 3D canvas. 
Each frame undergoes style transfer using MSG-Net~\cite{zhang2018multi}, and Uni-Fusion is used to construct the style LIM for the surface style field.
The test scene is ``office0'' from the Replica dataset captured from a single custom view.
$20$ images are used to provide the style and are attached at lower left corner accordingly.
Our Uni-Fusion successfully constructs style meshes that closely resemble the taste of the supplied style images.
For instance, with pure style or abstract painting, the 3D ``canvas'' shows a very similar style. 
Among the style images, with our favorite style, located in the middle of the fourth row, Uni-Fusion produces a high quality 3D sketch painting. 

In~\cref{fig:saliency}, we demonstrate saliency detection in 3D.
In this figure we select three scenes from ScanNet and two scenes from Replica.
Similarly, we detect saliency on each frame using InSPyReNet\cite{kim2022revisiting} and construct saliency LIM for surface saliency field.

In the second row, high saliency regions are colored in yellow, indicating the object of interest. 
%Here we see the object that is interest.
This information can be used to guide a robot's navigation in 3D scene.
For example, in the first column, the sofa, chair, curtain, and television in the room certainly attract more attention in daily life.
In the second column, a meeting room, the long desk and chairs are obviously the main components.
Similarly, in the third column showcasing a hotel room, the bed stands out, along with the sofa, desk, lamp, and TV in the fourth column, and the sofas and chairs in the last column.

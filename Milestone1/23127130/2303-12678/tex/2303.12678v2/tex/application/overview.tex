\section{Applications}
\label{sec:apps}
To demonstrate the wide range of applications of our model, we have implemented the following series of applications:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Incremental surface \& color reconstruction
	\item 3D saliency detection
	\item Open-vocabulary scene understanding
	\item Surface infrared field
	\item 3D style transfer
\end{enumerate}
Starting from our motivation in inspection and service robotics, we implement 1) incremental surface \& color reconstruction to visualize the robot environment.
For robot exploration, we implement 2) 3D saliency detection to indicate the salient regions in maps.
To recover object-level semantic information in the environment, we implement 3) open-vocabulary scene understanding to yield the regions containing the objects.
Furthermore, to demonstrate the flexibility, we implement 4) surface infrared fields and 5) 3D style transfer for artistic purposes. 

In~\cref{fig:latent_diff}, we classify these applications into 3 categories: (a) obtains properties directly from sensor observations, such as applications 1) and 4). (b) processes sensor data and predicts properties, such as applications 2), 5). (c) extends (b) by operating on high dimensional features, specifically application 3).

Applications 1) and 4) belong to the first category. We primarily describe 1) incremental surface \& color reconstruction (\cref{sec:incremental_reconstruction}), while for 4) we can easily replace color with infrared.
%
For the second with 2) and 5) in~\cref{sec:fabircated_prop}, we mainly discuss the usage of fabricated properties and do not provide detailed explanations of the mapping part, as it is already covered in the previous category.
%
Finally, we delve into the third category with application 3), which involves mapping a LIM for high-dimensional latent fields.
We demonstrate the flexibility and capability of this application
in~\cref{sec:openvoc}.

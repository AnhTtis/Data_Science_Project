%\section{Remapping Function} % one page
%%\section{Tracking Method}
%As introduced in IMT-Mapping[], general fusion model cannot deal with looped scene due to its frame-to-model nature.
%However, when there is a long loop, fixing the loop by optimize the poses is essential. For which, the general 3D reconstruction model donot support. 
%
%Here instead of implementing a tracking model, we follow IMT-Mapping to implement a Remapping function to make the model able to accept pose stream from the reliable SLAM model (for example, the ORB-SLAM2).

\section{Applications}
\label{sec:apps}
To demonstrate the wide range of usagages of our model, we implement a series of applications:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Incremental surface \& color reconstruction
	\item 3D saliency detection
	\item Open vocabulary scene understanding
	\item Surface infrared field
	\item 3D style transfer
\end{enumerate}
Originating from our motivation in inspection and service robotics, we implement 1) Incremental surface \& color reconstruction for visualization of robot surroundings.
For robot exploration, we implement 2) 3D saliency detection to indicate the salient regions in maps.
For recovering object-level semantic information in environments, we implement 3) open vocabulary scene understanding to yield the regions containing the objects..
Furthermore, to demonstrate the flexibility, we implement 4) surface infrared fields and 5) 3D style transfer for artistic purposes. 

In~\cref{fig:latent_diff}, we classify those 3 applications into 3 categories: (a) directly obtaining the properties from sensor observation, such as application 1) and 4). (b) processing on sensor data and predict properties, such as application 2), 5). (c) extending (b) to operating beyond latent features, such as application 3).
%Thus, in the following, we discuss about those categories of applications.
% we mainly describe the application 1) (\cref{sec:incremental_reconstruction}) and 3) (\cref{sec:openvoc}).

Application 1) and 4) are in the first one category. Thus, we mainly describe 1) incremental surface \& color reconstruction (\cref{sec:incremental_reconstruction}), while for 4) we can easily exchange color with infrared.
%
For the second with 2) and 5) in~\cref{sec:fabircated_prop}, we mainly describe the usage of fabricated properties.
As the mapping part is redundant to previous category, it will not be detailed.
%
The third category is the application 3) that maps a LIM for high dimensional latent fields.
We demonstrate that this application provides a flexible inference in \cref{sec:openvoc}.


%Afterwards, we evaluate application 1) and 3) in~\cref{sec:exp} and extensively show demonstration for all application in~\cref{sec:exp:extensive_app}.

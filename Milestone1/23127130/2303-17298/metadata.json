    "abstract": "Treatment rate has always been one of the most important factors affecting the spread of infectious diseases. In this paper, we study a treatment function SIR model with treatment rate related to the maximum treatment capacity, whose infection rate is also saturated nonlinear. By calculating and analyzing based on planar dynamic system, the existence and stability of disease-free equilibrium point of the model are found. And it is also found that the situation is more complex for the endemic equilibrium point of the model. Under the conditions of meeting different parameters, the number of endemic equilibrium points may be zero, one or two, and the behavior of the endemic equilibrium point may be a saddle point, a stable or unstable anti-saddle point or center, or even a degenerate case.",

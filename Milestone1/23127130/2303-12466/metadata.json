    "abstract": "We investigate the beam squint effect in uniform planar arrays (UPAs) and propose an efficient hybrid beamforming (HBF) design to mitigate the beam squint in multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems operating at terahertz band. We first analyze the array gain and derive the closed-form beam squint ratio that characterizes the severity of the beam squint effect on UPAs. The effect is shown to be more severe with a higher fractional bandwidth, while it can be significantly mitigated when the shape of a UPA approaches a square. We then focus on the HBF design that maximizes the system spectral efficiency. The design problem is challenging due to the frequency-flat nature and hardware constraints of the analog beamformer. We overcome the challenges by proposing an efficient decoupling design in which the digital and analog beamformers admit closed-form solutions, which facilitate practical implementations. Numerical results validate our analysis and show that the proposed HBF design is robust to beam squint, and thus, it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in wideband massive MIMO systems.",

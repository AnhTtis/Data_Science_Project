    "abstract": "In this article, we consider the problem of testing whether two latent position random graphs are correlated. We propose a test statistic based on the kernel method and introduce the estimation procedure based on the spectral decomposition of adjacency matrices. Even if no kernel function is specified, the sample graph covariance based on our proposed estimation method will converge to the population version. The asymptotic distribution of the sample covariance can also be obtained. We design a procedure for testing independence under permutation tests and demonstrate that our proposed test statistic is consistent and valid. Our estimation method can be extended to the spectral decomposition of normalized Laplacian matrices and inhomogeneous random graphs. Our method achieves promising results on both simulated and real data.",

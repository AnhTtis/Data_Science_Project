    "abstract": "The paper is devoted to a local heat kernel, which is a special part of the standard heat kernel. Locality means that all considerations are produced in an open convex set of a smooth Riemannian manifold. We study such properties and concepts as uniqueness, a symmetry of the Seeley-DeWitt coefficients, extension on the whole manifold, a family of special functions, and the late-time asymptotics with the use of the path integral formulation.",

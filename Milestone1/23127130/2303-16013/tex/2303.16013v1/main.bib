abstract = {A full-field, time-resolved interferometric method for the characterization of sparse, polydisperse spray systems is reported. The method makes use of the angular intensity oscillations in the wide-angle forward-scatter region. A pulsed laser is used to illuminate a planar sheet through the spray, which is imaged, out of focus, from the 45{\textdegree} direction. The image consists of a set of out-of-focus spots, each of which represents an individual droplet, and superimposed on which is a set of fringes corresponding to the angular intensity oscillations of that droplet. Macrophotographic recording with high-resolution digitization for image analysis provides a full-field capability. The spatial frequency of fringes on each spot in the image plane is dependent on the diameter of the corresponding droplet in the object plane, and a simple geometric analysis is shown to be appropriate for the calculation of the spatial frequency of fringes as a function of droplet size. Images are analyzed automatically by a software suite that uses Gaussian blur, Canny edge detection, and Hough transforms to locate individual droplets in the image field. Fringe spatial frequency is then determined by least-squares fitting to a Chirp function. The method is applicable to droplets with diameters in the range of several millimeters to several hundred millimeters and number densities of up to 103 to 104. The accuracy of the method for droplet-size determination has been evaluated by measurements of monodisperse aerosols of known droplet size, and measurements of droplet-size distribution in a polydisperse aerosol produced by a gasoline fuel injector are also presented. An extension of the method, using high-speed photography to measure two components of velocity in addition to size and position, is discussed. A two-wavelength approach may also offer the capability to measure the concentration of model fuel additives in droplets, and the results of a feasibility study are described.},

droplets and bubbles by advanced interferometric laser imaging
technique},
journal = {Measurement Science and Technology},
abstract = {This paper describes an advanced size and spatial distribution measurement technique for small spherical droplets and bubbles in two-phase flows. In the field of spray analysis, various kinds of measurement techniques have been proposed. Interferometric laser imaging for droplet sizing (ILIDS) is the method that can provide an instantaneous spatial distribution of droplet size. The number of fringes on the projected images by the ILIDS technique is correlated to their individual particle sizes. The measurement accuracy depends upon the image processing technique for estimating the size of the circular image and the fringe spacing. The relation between the fringe number and the particle diameter was derived by noting the angular phase difference of the external reflection and the direct refraction. Conventional ILIDS techniques, which observed the circular image with fringes on a film, have difficulties in discriminating the fringe images due to the overlap between them. Moreover, enlargement of the defocused image for measuring the larger particle caused the complicated overlapping. The objective of the present study is to describe the advanced ILIDS image acquisition optics and the accelerated data processing by employing a high resolution CCD camera and automated computing system. In the technique presented, the circular fringes are optically compressed into linear images that are horizontally defocused and vertically focused. The present partial compression technique, which is the integration of the vertical information of the image, reduced the noise involved and consequently the signal to noise ratio of the interference signals become much better than that of the conventional technique. The linear interferograms were easily detected by scanning the horizontal pixels of the recorded image. The signal processing procedure to determine the particle diameter needs only one-dimensional information for calculating the fringe spacing by discrete Fourier transforms. The present ILIDS technique was examined for the planar measurement of size and location of spray droplets, and the size transition of CO2 bubbles by absorption in water.}

Interferometric particle imaging (IPI) systems are used to measure the bubble diameter. In geometric approximation, the scattering angle cannot be greater than 2arccosm. We propose a universal method for calculating the bubble diameter at wide scattering angles and use an IPI system to measure the bubble-size distribution at 90\&\#x00B0; and 45\&\#x00B0;. The particle size distributions measured at two angles are consistent with each other. The results of this study indicate that this method is suitable for measuring the bubble-size distribution.},

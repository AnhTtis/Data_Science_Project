    "abstract": "There is no question to the fact that electric vehicles (EVs) are the most viable solution to the climate change that the planet has long been combating. Along the same line, it is a salient subject to expand the availability of charging infrastructure, which quintessentially necessitates the optimization of the charger's locations. This paper proposes to formulate the optimal EV charger location problem into a facility location problem (FLP). As an effort to find an efficient method to solve the well-known nonpolynomial deterministic (NP)-hard problem, we present a comparative quantification among several representative solving techniques.",

  abstract = {The promise of quantum computers is that certain computational tasks might be executed exponentially faster on a quantum processor than on a classical processor1. A fundamental challenge is to build a high-fidelity processor capable of running quantum algorithms in an exponentially large computational space. Here we report the use of a processor with programmable superconducting qubits2\textendash 7 to create quantum states on 53 qubits, corresponding to a computational state-space of dimension 253 (about 1016). Measurements from repeated experiments sample the resulting probability distribution, which we verify using classical simulations. Our Sycamore processor takes about 200 seconds to sample one instance of a quantum circuit a million times\textemdash our benchmarks currently indicate that the equivalent task for a state-of-the-art classical supercomputer would take approximately 10,000 years. This dramatic increase in speed compared to all known classical algorithms is an experimental realization of quantum supremacy8\textendash 14 for this specific computational task, heralding a much-anticipated computing paradigm.},

  abstract = {A critical question for the field of quantum computing in the near future is whether quantum devices without error correction can perform a well-defined computational task beyond the capabilities of state-of-the-art classical computers, achieving so-called quantum supremacy. We study the task of sampling from the output distributions of (pseudo-)random quantum circuits, a natural task for benchmarking quantum computers. Crucially, sampling this distribution classically requires a direct numerical simulation of the circuit, with computational cost exponential in the number of qubits. This requirement is typical of chaotic systems. We extend previous results in computational complexity to argue more formally that this sampling task must take exponential time in a classical computer. We study the convergence to the chaotic regime using extensive supercomputer simulations, modeling circuits with up to 42 qubits - the largest quantum circuits simulated to date for a computational task that approaches quantum supremacy. We argue that while chaotic states are extremely sensitive to errors, quantum supremacy can be achieved in the near-term with approximately fifty superconducting qubits. We introduce cross entropy as a useful benchmark of quantum circuits which approximates the circuit fidelity. We show that the cross entropy can be efficiently measured when circuit simulations are available. Beyond the classically tractable regime, the cross entropy can be extrapolated and compared with theoretical estimates of circuit fidelity to define a practical quantum supremacy test.},

However, the amount of classical resources required to simulate a quantum system scales exponenially with its size. This imposes, in the generic case, dramatic limits on the sizes reachable and requires that great care is taken in order to maximise performance. Nonetheless, and in part due to this difficulty, there is much to be learnt from simulating many-body quantum systems. One useful set of tools in this case is quantum information inspired quantities such as entanglement meausures. Entanglement is also the key quantity when formulating tensor networks, an efficient representation of certain many-body quantum states. quimb is a pure python library that covers all these areas, with an emphasis on being interactive and easy to use without sacrificing performance.},

The classical computing complexity of this simulator is directly related to the entanglement generation of the underlying quantum circuit rather than the number of qubits or gate operations. We apply our method to study random quantum circuits, which allows us to quantify precisely the memory usage and the time requirements of random quantum circuits.

  abstract = {As quantum computers improve in the number of qubits and fidelity, the question of when they surpass state-of-the-art classical computation for a well-defined computational task is attracting much attention. The leading candidate task for this milestone entails sampling from the output distribution defined by a random quantum circuit. We develop a massively-parallel simulation tool Rollright that does not require inter-process communication (IPC) or proprietary hardware. We also develop two ways to trade circuit fidelity for computational speedups, so as to match the fidelity of a given quantum computer --- a task previously thought impossible. We report massive speedups for the sampling task over prior software from Microsoft, IBM, Alibaba and Google, as well as supercomputer and GPU-based simulations. By using publicly available Google Cloud Computing, we price such simulations and enable comparisons by total cost across hardware platforms. We simulate approximate sampling from the output of a circuit with 7x8 qubits and depth 1+40+1 by producing one million bitstring probabilities with fidelity 0.5\%, at an estimated cost of \$35184. The simulation costs scale linearly with fidelity, and using this scaling we estimate that extending circuit depth to 1+48+1 increases costs to one million dollars. Scaling the simulation to 10M bitstring probabilities needed for sampling 1M bitstrings helps comparing simulation to quantum computers. We describe refinements in benchmarks that slow down leading simulators, halving the circuit depth that can be simulated within the same time.},

  abstract = {Tensor Core is a mixed-precision matrix-matrix multiplication unit on NVIDIA GPUs with a theoretical peak performance of more than 300 TFlop/s on Ampere architectures. Tensor Cores were developed in response to the high demand of dense matrix multiplication from machine learning. However, many applications in scientific computing such as preconditioners for iterative solvers and low-precision Fourier transforms can exploit these Tensor Cores. To compute a matrix multiplication on Tensor Cores, we need to convert input matrices to half-precision, which results in loss of accuracy. To avoid this, we can keep the mantissa loss in the conversion using additional half-precision variables and use them for correcting the accuracy of matrix-matrix multiplication. Even with this correction, the use of Tensor Cores yields higher throughput compared to FP32 SIMT Cores. Nevertheless, the correcting capability of this method alone is limited, and the resulting accuracy cannot match that of a matrix multiplication on FP32 SIMT Cores. We address this problem and develop a high accuracy, high performance, and low power consumption matrix-matrix multiplication implementation using Tensor Cores, which exactly matches the accuracy of FP32 SIMT Cores while achieving superior throughput. The implementation is based on NVIDIA's CUTLASS. We found that the key to achieving this accuracy is how to deal with the rounding inside Tensor Cores and underflow probability during the correction computation. Our implementation achieves 51TFlop/s for a limited exponent range using FP16 Tensor Cores and 33TFlop/s for full exponent range of FP32 using TF32 Tensor Cores on NVIDIA A100 GPUs, which outperforms the theoretical FP32 SIMT Core peak performance of 19.5TFlop/s.},

By employing a small computational cluster containing 60 graphical processing units (GPUs), we compute exact amplitudes and probabilities of 2\texttimes 106 correlated bitstrings with some entries fixed (which span a subspace of the output probability distribution) for the Sycamore circuit with 53 qubits and 20 cycles. The obtained results verify the Porter-Thomas distribution of the large and deep quantum circuits of Google, provide datasets and benchmarks for developing approximate simulation methods, and can be used for spoofing the linear cross entropy benchmark of quantum supremacy. Then we extend the proposed big-batch method to a full-amplitude simulation approach that is more efficient than the existing Schr\"odinger method on shallow circuits and the Schr\"odinger-Feynman method in general, enabling us to obtain the state vector of Google's simplifiable circuit with n=43 qubits and m=14 cycles using only one GPU. We also manage to obtain the state vector for Google's simplifiable circuits with n=50 qubits and m=14 cycles using a small GPU cluster, breaking the previous record on the number of qubits in full-amplitude simulations. Our method is general in computing bitstring probabilities for a broad class of quantum circuits and can find applications in the verification of quantum computers.

  abstract = {Quantum information science explores the frontier of highly complex quantum states, the "entanglement frontier." This study is motivated by the observation (widely believed but unproven) that classical systems cannot simulate highly entangled quantum systems efficiently, and we hope to hasten the day when well controlled quantum systems can perform tasks surpassing what can be done in the classical world. One way to achieve such "quantum supremacy" would be to run an algorithm on a quantum computer which solves a problem with a super-polynomial speedup relative to classical computers, but there may be other ways that can be achieved sooner, such as simulating exotic quantum states of strongly correlated matter. To operate a large scale quantum computer reliably we will need to overcome the debilitating effects of decoherence, which might be done using "standard" quantum hardware protected by quantum error-correcting codes, or by exploiting the nonabelian quantum statistics of anyons realized in solid state systems, or by combining both methods. Only by challenging the entanglement frontier will we learn whether Nature provides extravagant resources far beyond what the classical world would allow.},

  abstract = {Hypergraphs are a generalization of graphs where edges (aka nets) are allowed to connect more than two vertices. They have a similarly wide range of applications as graphs. This paper considers the fundamental and intensively studied problem of balanced hypergraph partitioning, which asks for partitioning the vertices into k disjoint blocks of bounded size while minimizing an objective function over the hyperedges. Here, we consider the two most commonly used objectives: the cut-net metric and the connectivity metric. We describe our open source hypergraph partitioner KaHyPar which is based on the successful multi-level approach \textendash{} driving it to the extreme of using one level for (almost) every vertex. Using carefully designed data structures and dynamic update techniques, this approach turns out to have a very good time\textendash quality tradeoff. We present two preprocessing techniques \textendash{} pin sparsification using locality sensitive hashing and community detection based on the Louvain algorithm. The community structure is used to guide the coarsening process that incrementally contracts vertices. Portfolio-based partitioning of the contracted hypergraph then already achieves a good initial solution. While reversing the contraction process, a combination of several refinement techniques achieves a good final partitioning. In particular, we support a highly-localized local search that can directly produce a k-way partitioning and complement this with flow-based techniques that take a more global view. Optionally, a memetic algorithm evolves a pool of solution candidates to an overall good solution. We evaluate KaHyPar for a large set of instances from a wide range of application domains. With respect to quality, KaHyPar outperforms all previously considered systems that can handle large hypergraphs such as hMETIS, PaToH, Mondriaan, or Zoltan. Somewhat surprisingly, to some extend, this even extends to graph partitioners such as KaHIP when considering the special case of graphs. KaHyPar is also faster than most of these systems except for PaToH which represents a different speed\textendash quality tradeoff.},

While creating PEPS allows to solve PP problems, the latter two tasks are both proven to be \#P-complete. We further show how PEPS can be used to approximate ground states of gapped Hamiltonians, and that creating them is easier than creating arbitrary PEPS. The main tool for our proofs is a duality between PEPS and postselection which allows to use existing results from quantum compexity.},

	abstract = {The promise of quantum computers is that certain computational tasks might be executed exponentially faster on a quantum processor than on a classical processor1. A fundamental challenge is to build a high-fidelity processor capable of running quantum algorithms in an exponentially large computational space. Here we report the use of a processor with programmable superconducting qubits2–7 to create quantum states on 53 qubits, corresponding to a computational state-space of dimension 253 (about 1016). Measurements from repeated experiments sample the resulting probability distribution, which we verify using classical simulations. Our Sycamore processor takes about 200 seconds to sample one instance of a quantum circuit a million times—our benchmarks currently indicate that the equivalent task for a state-of-the-art classical supercomputer would take approximately 10,000 years. This dramatic increase in speed compared to all known classical algorithms is an experimental realization of quantum supremacy8–14 for this specific computational task, heralding a much-anticipated computing paradigm.},

    "abstract": "We present synthesis and $^{75}$As-nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements for the noncentrosymmetric superconductor CaPtAs with a superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ of $\\sim 1.5$ K. We discovered two different forms of CaPtAs during synthesis; one is a high-temperature tetragonal form that was previously reported, and the other is a low-temperature form consistent with the orthorhombic structure of CaPtP. According to the $^{75}$As-NQR measurement for superconducting tetragonal CaPtAs, the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1$ has an obvious coherence peak below $T_c$ and does not follow a simple exponential variation at low temperatures. These findings indicate that CaPtAs is a multigap superconductor and a large $s$-wave component.",

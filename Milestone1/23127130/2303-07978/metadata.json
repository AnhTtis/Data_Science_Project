    "abstract": "Low-energy background through Compton scattering from the ambient $γ$ rays can be contaminated in direct dark matter search experiments. In this paper, we report comparable measurements on low-energy spectra via Compton scattering from several $γ$-ray sources with a p-type point-contact germanium detector. The spectra between 500 eV and 18 keV have been measured and analyzed. Moreover, the features of the electron binding effect, particularly at the edges of the K- and L-shells in the germanium atom, were observed with different gamma sources and were consistent with the models in the Geant4 simulation. An empirical background model is proposed that provides insights into understanding the low-energy background in germanium for direct dark matter experiments.",

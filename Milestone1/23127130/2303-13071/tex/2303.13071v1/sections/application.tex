Figure~\ref{fig:recon} demonstrates full-head reconstruction from a single-view portrait using PanoHead's generative latent space. 
To achieve that, we first perform an optimization to find the corresponding latent noise $z$ for the target image using pixel-wise L$_2$ loss and image-level  LPIPS loss~\cite{zhang2018unreasonable}. To further improve reconstruction quality, we perform pivotal tuning inversion~(PTI)~\cite{roich2021pivotal} to alter the generator parameters with a fixed optimized latent code $z.$ From a single-view target image, PanoHead not only reconstructs photo-realistic image and high-fidelity geometry but also enables novel-view synthesis in $360^\circ$, including large pose and back head. 
% Note that even with large camera pose portrait as shown in the first row of Figure~\ref{fig:recon}, our method still works robustly, indicating an informative 3D prior learnt by our model. 
% Please refer to our supplementary materials for other applications.
% Note that PanoHead can reconstruct from image with large camera pose (first row of ), which shows the learned 3D prior is informative and covers comprehensive camera pose distribution.

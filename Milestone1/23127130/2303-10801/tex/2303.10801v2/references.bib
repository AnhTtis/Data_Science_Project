  eprint      = {1506.01497},
  eprintclass = {cs.CV},
  eprinttype  = {arXiv},
  abstract    = {State-of-the-art object detection networks depend on region proposal algorithms to hypothesize object locations. Advances like SPPnet and Fast R-CNN have reduced the running time of these detection networks, exposing region proposal computation as a bottleneck. In this work, we introduce a Region Proposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. An RPN is a fully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. The RPN is trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection. We further merge RPN and Fast R-CNN into a single network by sharing their convolutional features---using the recently popular terminology of neural networks with 'attention' mechanisms, the RPN component tells the unified network where to look. For the very deep VGG-16 model, our detection system has a frame rate of 5fps (including all steps) on a GPU, while achieving state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012, and MS COCO datasets with only 300 proposals per image. In ILSVRC and COCO 2015 competitions, Faster R-CNN and RPN are the foundations of the 1st-place winning entries in several tracks. Code has been made publicly available.},

  abstract    = {Two-dimensional (2D) quantum magnetism is a paradigm in strongly correlated many-body physics. The understanding of 2D quantum magnetism can be expedited by employing a controllable quantum simulator that faithfully maps 2D-spin Hamiltonians. The 2D quantum simulators can exhibit exotic phenomena such as frustrated quantum magnetism and topological order and can be used to show quantum computational advantages. Many experimental platforms are being developed, including Rydberg atoms and superconducting annealers. However, with trapped-ion systems, which showed the most advanced controllability and quantum coherence, quantum magnetism was explored in one-dimensional chains. Here, we report simulations of frustrated quantum magnetism with 2D ion crystals. We create a variety of spin-spin interactions for quantum magnets, including those that exhibit frustration by driving different vibrational modes and adiabatically prepare the corresponding ground states. The experimentally measured ground states are consistent with the theoretical predictions and are highly degenerate for geometrically frustrated spin models in two dimensions. Quantum coherence of the ground states is probed by reversing the time evolution of the B-field to the initial value and then measuring the extent to which the remaining state coincides with the initial state. Our results open the door for quantum simulations with 2D ion crystals.},

  abstract    = {Precision spectroscopy on trapped-ion crystals subject to correlated dephasing can reveal a multitude of information in the absence of any single-particle coherences. We use correlation spectroscopy for measuring ion-ion distances and transition frequency shifts in one- and two-dimensional ion crystals by analyzing multi-particle correlations of up to $N=91$ qubits, each of which is encoded in a single ion. Additionally we carry out single-shot measurements of the laser-ion detuning and of path-length fluctuations. We show that the information contained in $N$-particle correlations reduces the measurement uncertainty as compared to the case where only two-particle correlations are analyzed. We derive quantum precision limits for this problem. While for a pair of qubits entanglement can reduce the measurement uncertainty, entanglement-free correlation spectroscopy becomes asymptotically optimal in the limit of $N\rightarrow\infty$ when the measurement goal is the determination of all phase differences between the qubits.},

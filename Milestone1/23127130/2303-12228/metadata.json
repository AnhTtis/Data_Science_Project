    "abstract": "We study a variant of the Generalized Excited Random Walk (GERW) on $\\mathbb{Z}^d$ introduced by Menshikov, Popov, Ramírez and Vachkovskaia in [Ann. Probab. 40 (5), 2012]. It consists in a particular version of the model studied in [arXiv preprint arXiv:2211.05715, 2022] where excitation may or may not occur according to a time-dependent probability. Specifically, given $\\{p_n\\}_{n \\ge 1}$, $p_n \\in (0, 1]$ for all $n \\ge 1$, whenever the process visits a site at time $n$ for the first time, with probability $p_n$ it gains a drift in a determined direction. Otherwise, it behaves as a $d$-martingale with zero-mean vector. We refer to the model as a GERW in time-inhomogeneous Bernoulli environment, in short, $p_n$-GERW.\n  Under bounded jumps hypothesis and with $p_n \\approx n^{-β}$, $β\\geq 1/2$, we show a series of results for the $p_n$-GERW depending on the value of $β$ and on the dimension. Specifically, for $β> 1/2$, $d\\geq 2$ and $β=1/2$ and $d=2$ we obtain a Functional Central Limit Theorem. Finally, for $β=1/2$ and $d \\ge 22$ we obtain that the diffusively rescaled $p_n$-GERW is tight, and every limit point $\\mathcal{Y}$ satisfies $W_t \\cdot \\ell + c_1 \\sqrt{t} \\preceq \\mathcal{Y}_t \\cdot \\ell \\preceq W_t \\cdot \\ell + c_2 \\sqrt{t}$, where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are known positive constants, $W_{\\cdot}$ is a Brownian motion and $\\ell$ is the direction of the drift.",

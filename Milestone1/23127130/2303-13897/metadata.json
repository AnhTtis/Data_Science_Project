    "abstract": "We show that a network of non-identical nodes, with excitable dynamics, pulse-coupled, with coupling delays depending on the Euclidean distance between nodes, is able to adapt the topology of its connections to obtain spike frequency synchronization. The adapted network exhibits remarkable properties: sparse, anti-cluster, necessary presence of a minimum of inhibitory nodes, predominance of connections from inhibitory nodes over those from excitatory nodes and finally spontaneous spatial structuring of the inhibitory projections: the furthest the most intense.",

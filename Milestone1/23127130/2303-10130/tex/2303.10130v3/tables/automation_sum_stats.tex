\caption{Column 1 lists the five possible GPT-4-generated annotations on the automation taxonomy for LLM++ (See full taxonomy in Appendix A). It is important to remember that these annotations are generated based on the definition given of LLM++ in the taxonomy, which includes not only LLM capabilities, but the potential for software built on top of an LLM to automate the task. The number of tasks assigned to each label is presented in column 2, and the share of all tasks assigned the label is presented in column 3.}

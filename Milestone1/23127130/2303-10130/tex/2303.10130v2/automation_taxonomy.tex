LLM++ is a software tool that can perform a wide range of digital tasks but cannot program physical machines or objects.

Consider the most powerful OpenAI large language model (LLM). This model can complete many tasks that can be formulated as having text, image, or audio input and text, image, or audio output. The model also cannot draw up-to-date facts (those from <1 year ago) unless they are captured in the input. This system cannot accurately retrieve very detailed information from image inputs, such as measurements of dimensions within an image.

On its own, the LLM can perform tasks that can be reduced to:
- Writing and transforming text and code according to complex instructions,
- Providing edits to existing text or code following specifications,
- Writing code that can help perform simple, repetitive digital tasks,
- Debugging code or software
- Programming in computer languages like Python, C++, Java, Stata
- Assisting with a data analysis
- Translating text between languages,
- Summarizing short documents,
- Providing feedback on documents,
- Answering questions about a document,
- Generating questions a user might want to ask about a document,
- Writing questions for an interview or assessment,
- Writing and responding to emails, including ones that involve refuting information or engaging in a negotiation (but only if the negotiation is via written correspondence),
- Maintain records of written data,
- Prepare training materials based on general knowledge,
- Searching for a relevant document over a small number of documents,
- Reading text from PDFs,
- Scanning images,
- Creating or editing digital images according to instructions,
- Captioning an image,
- Transcribing text, or
- Informing anyone of any information via any written or spoken medium.

Assume you are a worker with an average level of expertise in your role trying to complete the given task. You have access to the LLM as well as any other existing software or computer hardware tools mentioned in the task. You also have access to any commonly available technical tools accessible via a laptop (e.g. a microphone, speakers, etc.). You do not have access to any other physical tools or materials.

You also have access to LLM++ which is additional software developed on top of the LLM. LLM++ includes capabilities such as:
- Summarizing documents longer than 2000 words and answering questions about those documents,
- Retrieving up-to-date facts from the Internet and using those facts in combination with the LLM capabilities,
- Searching over an organization’s existing knowledge, data, or documents and retrieving information,
- Retrieving highly specialized domain knowledge,
- Making recommendations given data or written input,
- Analyzing written information to inform decisions,
- Preparing training materials based on highly specialized knowledge,
- Performing legal research,
- Providing counsel on issues,
- Writing lesson plans, and
- Maintaining databases.

We refer to this suite of software tools as LLM++. LLM++ can NOT program physical machines or objects.

Please label the given task according to the rubric below.

**T0 No-Automation Exposure** A class of tasks for which LLM++ can not conceivably perform any aspect of the task in any manner. 

**T4 Full Automation Exposure** A class of tasks where, in most contexts in which this task is currently performed by a human, LLM++ can complete all aspects of this task with high quality when prompted by a human. The output does not normally require oversight by a human. Oversight is not normally required for tasks labeled T4 because the consequences for failure or inaccuracy are small for this task, human judgment is not necessary to complete this task, and generative models can consistently perform this task with very high quality.

**T3 High Automation Exposure** A class of tasks where, in most contexts in which this task is currently performed by a human, LLM++ could complete 90-100% of the components of the task when prompted, but the output requires oversight from a human. Oversight is normally required because the consequences for failure or inaccuracy are significant for this task, human judgment is necessary to complete this task, and/or generative models cannot perform all aspects of this task with high quality consistently. These tasks rely almost exclusively on the processing of digital information, but human judgment is needed to ensure that any digital outputs from LLM++ are high enough quality to be acceptable for the particular context.

** T2 Moderate Automation Exposure** A class of tasks where, in most contexts in which this task is performed by a human, LLM++ could complete between 50%-90% of the components of the task at high quality. These tasks normally rely heavily on the processing of digital information, but a significant portion of the task also involves actions that LLM++ cannot perform with high quality. These tasks require at least some human action beyond just double-checking generative model outputs (such as interpretation, judgment, human-to-human communication, or physical actions).

** T1 Low Automation Exposure** A class of tasks where, in most contexts in which this task is performed by a human, LLM++ could complete between 0%-50% of the components of the task at high quality. These tasks normally rely only partially on the processing of digital information, while the majority of the task involves actions that LLM++ cannot perform with high quality. A majority of the actions that need to be taken to complete this task require a human to perform the action.

\#\# Definitions

**High quality** means someone receiving or reviewing the output would not be able to tell the difference between whether it came from LLM++ or a human. For tasks that require a lot of interaction during the completion of the task (e.g. meetings, negotiations), high quality means the people you were interacting with either would not know or would not care that they were interacting with with LLM++.

**Digital information** or **information that can easily be expressed digitally** includes but is not limited to text, audio, images, PDFs, books, and code.

\#\# Annotation Examples

Occupation: Special Education Teachers, Preschool
Task: Develop individual educational plans (IEPs) designed to promote students' educational, physical, or social development.
Automation score (T0/T1/T2/T3/T4): T2
Explanation: While LLM++ can assist in the creation of educational plans, this task requires significant interpretation and judgment by a human in order to be effective. Special Education Teachers must consider the individual needs and abilities of each student, as well as communicate with parents and other educators to ensure the plan is appropriate and effective. While LLM++ can provide suggestions and potential plans, it cannot make the final decision or communicate with stakeholders.

Occupation: Construction and Building Inspectors
Task: Inspect and monitor construction sites to ensure adherence to safety standards, building codes, or specifications.
Automation score (T0/T1/T2/T3/T4): T1
Explanation: While LLM++ can provide some support in the inspection and monitoring of construction sites, this task involves a significant amount of physical inspection and communication with workers and supervisors on-site. Additionally, the inspector may need to make on-the-spot judgments based on what they observe and may need to refer to local building codes and regulations which may not be available in digital format. As such, this task requires a significant amount of human input and oversight.

Occupation: Food and Tobacco Roasting, Baking, and Drying Machine Operators and Tenders
Task: Dump sugar dust from collectors into melting tanks and add water to reclaim sugar lost during processing.
Automation score (T0/T1/T2/T3/T4): T0
Explanation: This task requires physical actions that cannot be completed by LLM++.

Occupation: Historians
Task: Translate or request translation of reference materials.
Automation score (T0/T1/T2/T3/T4): T4
Explanation: LLM++ can easily complete this task by translating text from one language to another. Human intervention is not usually necessary.

Occupation: Electronics Engineer
Task: Prepare documentation containing information such as confidential descriptions or specifications of proprietary hardware or software, product development or introduction schedules, product costs, or information about product performance weaknesses.
Automation score (T0/T1/T2/T3/T4): T2
Explanation: LLM++ can assist with documentation but human judgment is needed for understanding specifications, costs, and performance weaknesses. Thus, this task falls under T2 Moderate Automation Exposure.

Occupation: Advanced Practice Psychiatric Nurse
Task: Write prescriptions for psychotropic medications as allowed by state regulations and collaborative practice agreements.
Automation score (T0/T1/T2/T3/T4): T1
Explanation: LLM++ could be used to help create prescriptions given digital input about the patient’s context, but a human would need to double-check the information to ensure that it meets regulations and is appropriate for the patient.

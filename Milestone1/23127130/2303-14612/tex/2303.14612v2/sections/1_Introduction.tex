 % The metaverse, a virtual world where people can interact with each other and objects in a fully immersive environment, has become a hot topic among technology companies. Meta and other companies have advertised three different scenarios where the metaverse can be utilized: gaming, online meetings, and virtual offices. While these scenarios have the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with each other, the integration of deepfakes in the metaverse brings serious security implications, particularly with regards to impersonation.

 The emergence of the metaverse~\cite{Metaverse_Survey} has captured the attention of the technology community, giving rise to widespread anticipation and debate. Prominent companies such as Meta (formerly Facebook), Microsoft, and Nvidia have expressed interest in the concept of a fully immersive virtual world, where individuals can interact with one another and their surroundings. To this end, various companies are releasing their own metaverse experiences, including Meta's Horizon Worlds~\cite{Facebook_metaverse,Meta_Horizon_Worlds}, Roblox's gaming metaverse~\cite{Roblox_metaverse}, Microsoft's Mesh~\cite{Microsoft_Mesh}, and Nvidia's Omniverse~\cite{NVIDIA_Omniverse}. While the potential applications of the metaverse are vast, with possibilities ranging from gaming to virtual meetings and offices, each method has its own benefits and limitations.

However, the applicability of deepfakes~\cite{Deepfake_survey,le2023deepfake} in the metaverse presents significant security implications, particularly with regard to impersonation. Deepfakes are computer-generated images or videos that can be manipulated to look like real people or events. The ability to generate such content has significantly increased with advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Recently, deepfakes in the metaverse have become a topic of discussion on different forums and media articles~\cite{Media_DeepfakesInMetaverse_1,Media_DeepfakesInMetaverse_2,Media_DeepfakesInMetaverse_3,Media_DeepfakesInMetaverse_4}.

The utilisation of metaverse technology has been associated with numerous benefits, including the provision of a fully immersive virtual environment that facilitates interaction with other users and virtual objects. Nevertheless, the potential deployment of deepfake technology to perpetrate malicious activities, such as impersonation, has shed light on the limitations of the technology and the need for effective security measures to be put in place. It is noteworthy that existing state-of-the-art deepfake detection methods~\cite{ShallowNet1,ShallowNet2,SamGAN,SamTAR,CLRNetold,CLRNet,MinhaFRETAL,MinhaCORED,ShahrozAWS,HasamFakeAVCeleb,HasamACMMM,JeonghoPTD} primarily focus on detecting deepfakes in the physical world and do not take into account the possibility of deepfakes in the metaverse. Thus, the current research is challenged with an evident gap in the identification and prevention of deepfakes in the metaverse, making it imperative to shed light on this research gap. 

In this paper, we explore the security implications of deepfakes in the metaverse. We will start by defining the concept of the metaverse and how it is expected to be used in three scenarios: (i) gaming, (ii) online meetings, and (iii) virtual offices (see Fig.~\ref{fig:scenarios}). We will also discuss the potential dangers of deepfake in each of the three scenarios by exploring the potential consequences of deepfake misuse in the metaverse, such as the ability to impersonate others, manipulate meetings, and disrupt virtual work environments. We will also discuss potential solutions to mitigate these risks and ensure the safety and security of metaverse users. We also explore the security implications of deepfakes in the metaverse to fake digital identity, the CIA triad, legal and regulatory challenges, privacy issues, and darkverse. Through this work, we aim to explore the potential security implications of deepfakes in the metaverse and to raise awareness of the risks and challenges posed by this technology.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study shells of the $D_4$ lattice with a slightly general concept of spherical $t$-designs due to Delsarte-Goethals-Seidel, namely, the spherical design of harmonic index $T$ (spherical $T$-design for short) introduced by Delsarte-Seidel. We first observe that the $2m$-shell of $D_4$ is an antipodal spherical $\\{10,4,2\\}$-design on the three dimensional sphere. We then prove that the $2$-shell, which is the $D_4$ root system, is tight $\\{10,4,2\\}$-design, using the linear programming method. The uniqueness of the $D_4$ root system as an antipodal spherical $\\{10,4,2\\}$-design with 24 points is shown. We give two applications of the uniqueness: a decomposition of the shells of the $D_4$ lattice in terms of orthogonal transformations of the $D_4$ root system: and the uniqueness of the $D_4$ lattice as an even integral lattice of level 2 in the four dimensional Euclidean space. We also reveal a connection between the harmonic strength of the shells of the $D_4$ lattice and non-vanishing of the Fourier coefficient of a certain newforms of level 2. Motivated by this, congruence relations for the Fourier coefficients are discussed.",

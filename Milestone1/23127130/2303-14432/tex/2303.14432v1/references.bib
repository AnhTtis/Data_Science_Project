abstract = { 12.1 ▪ Introduction Partial differential equations (PDEs) are an effective tool to model phenomena in applied sciences. Realistic problems usually depend on several physical and geometrical parameters that can be calibrated by using real data. In real scenarios, however, these parameters are affected by uncertainty due to measurement errors or scattered data information. To deal with more reliable models which take this issue into account, stochastic PDEs can be numerically approximated. In the uncertainty quantification (UQ) context, many simulations are run to better understand the system at hand and to compute statistics of outcomes over quantities of interest. In particular, the input parameters of the stochastic PDEs are assumed to be random finite-dimensional variables. }

abstract = {Reduced basis approximations of Optimal Control Problems (OCPs) governed by steady partial differential equations (PDEs) with random parametric inputs are analyzed and constructed. Such approximations are based on a Reduced Order Model, which in this work is constructed using the method of weighted Proper Orthogonal Decomposition. This Reduced Order Model then is used to efficiently compute the reduced basis approximation for any outcome of the random parameter. We demonstrate that such OCPs are well-posed by applying the adjoint approach, which also works in the presence of admissibility constraints and in the case of non linear-quadratic OCPs, and thus is more general than the conventional Lagrangian approach. We also show that a step in the construction of these Reduced Order Models, known as the aggregation step, is not fundamental and can in principle be skipped for noncoercive problems, leading to a cheaper online phase. Numerical applications in three scenarios from environmental science are considered, in which the governing PDE is steady and the control is distributed. Various parameter distributions are taken, and several implementations of the weighted Proper Orthogonal Decomposition are compared by choosing different quadrature rules.}

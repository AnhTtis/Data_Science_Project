@article{Go216,
	abstract = {The game of Go has long been viewed as the most challenging of classic games for artificial intelligence owing to its enormous search space and the difficulty of evaluating board positions and moves. Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses `value networks'to evaluate board positions and `policy networks'to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8{\%} winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away.},

abstract="Predictive process monitoring is concerned with the analysis of events produced during the execution of a process in order to predict the future state of ongoing cases thereof. Existing techniques in this field are able to predict, at each step of a case, the likelihood that the case will end up in an undesired outcome. These techniques, however, do not take into account what process workers may do with the generated predictions in order to decrease the likelihood of undesired outcomes. This paper proposes a framework for prescriptive process monitoring, which extends predictive process monitoring approaches with the concepts of alarms, interventions, compensations, and mitigation effects. The framework incorporates a parameterized cost model to assess the cost-benefit tradeoffs of applying prescriptive process monitoring in a given setting. The paper also outlines an approach to optimize the generation of alarms given a dataset and a set of cost model parameters. The proposed approach is empirically evaluated using a range of real-life event logs.",

abstract="The allocation of resources to process tasks can have a significant impact on the performance (such as cost, time) of those tasks, and hence of the overall process. Past resource allocation decisions, when correlated with process execution histories annotated with quality of service (or performance) measures, can be a rich source of knowledge about the best resource allocation decisions. The optimality of resource allocation decisions is not determined by the process instance alone, but also by the context in which these instances are executed. This phenomenon turns out to be even more compelling when the resources in question are human resources. Human workers with same the organizational role and capabilities can have heterogeneous behaviors based on their operational context. In this work, we propose an approach to supporting resource allocation decisions by extracting information about the process context and process performance from past process executions. The information extracted is analyzed using exploratory data mining techniques to discover resource allocation decisions. The knowledge thus acquired can be used to guide resource allocations in new process instances. Experiments performed on synthetic and real-world execution logs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

Although a wide variety of mechanisms are emerging to support resource allocation in business process execution, these approaches do not consider performance optimization. This paper introduces a mechanism in which the resource allocation optimization problem is modeled as Markov decision processes and solved using reinforcement learning. The proposed mechanism observes its environment to learn appropriate policies which optimize resource allocation in business process execution. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms well known heuristic or hand-coded strategies, and may improve the current state of business process management.}

abstract = {In recent years, researchers have explored the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to the control of complex nonlinear and time varying industrial processes. However RL algorithms use exploratory actions to learn an optimal control policy and converge slowly while popular inverse model ANN based control strategies require extensive training data to learn the inverse model of complex nonlinear systems. In this paper a novel approach that avoids the need for extensive training data to construct an exact inverse model in the inverse ANN approach, the need for an exact and stable inverse to exist and the need for exhaustive and costly exploration in pure RL based strategies is proposed. In this approach an initial approximate control policy learnt by an artificial neural network is refined using a reinforcement learning strategy. This Partially Supervised Reinforcement Learning (PSRL) strategy is applied to the economically important problem of control of a semi-continuous batch-fed bioreactor used for yeast fermentation. The bioreactor control problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solved using pure RL and PSRL algorithms. Model based and model-free RL control experiments and simulations are used to demonstrate the superior performance of the PSRL strategy compared to the pure RL and inverse model ANN based control strategies on a variety of performance metrics.}

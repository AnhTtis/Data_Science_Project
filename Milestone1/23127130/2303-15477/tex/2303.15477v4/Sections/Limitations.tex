\section{Limitations}
\label{sec:limitations}

Our approach presents a general framework for PEMs and specifically focuses on extending LEM. 
Despite the fast and simple computations of PEMs, there are several other types of Riemannian metrics on SPD manifolds, such as AIM \cite{pennec2006riemannian} and Bures-Wasserstein Metric (BWM) \cite{bhatia2019bures}.
These metrics do not belong to PEMs but have shown successful performance on different applications.
Therefore, the adaptive mechanisms of these types of Riemannian metrics should also be addressed in future work.

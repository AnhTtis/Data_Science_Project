\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusions}

Riemannian metrics are foundations for Riemannian learning algorithms.
In this paper, we propose a general framework for characterizing PEMs on SPD manifolds.
According to this framework, we extend LEM into ALEMs for SPD matrix learning.
We also present comprehensive and rigorous theories of our metrics.
Extensive experiments indicate that SPD deep networks can benefit from our metrics.
\cref{eq:lcm_pullback_map} indicates that LCM is pulled back by Cholesky decomposition and diagonal logarithm.
Therefore, as a future avenue, the discussions in this paper can be readily transferred to LCM.

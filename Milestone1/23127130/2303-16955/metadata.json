    "abstract": "In recent years, quantum computing has emerged as a promising technology for solving complex computational problems. Generative modeling is a technique that allows us to learn and generate new data samples similar to the original dataset. In this paper, we propose a generative modeling approach using quantum gates to generate new samples from a given dataset. We start with a brief introduction to quantum computing and generative modeling. Then, we describe our proposed approach, which involves encoding the dataset into quantum states and using quantum gates to manipulate these states to generate new samples. We also provide mathematical details of our approach and demonstrate its effectiveness through experimental results on various datasets.",

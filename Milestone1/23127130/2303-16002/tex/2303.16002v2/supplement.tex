The process tensor formalism is an operational approach to general (i.e. not restricted to Markovian) open quantum systems~\cite{pollock_non-markovian_2018}.
The key idea is to describe open quantum system through a mathematical object---the process tensor (PT)---that encodes the outcome of all possible experiments that consist of a sequence of \emph{control operations} on the system.
A control operation may be any experimentally realizable intervention on the system, i.e. a completely positive map, which for example includes measurements on the system, or the application of a unitary.


In Fig.~\ref{fig:process-tensor}a we draw a quantum circuit in Liouville space for a general total system (i.e. the open system together with its environment) with control operations on only the open system at times $t_1$, $t_2$, $t_3$, and $t_4$.
The super-operators $\mathcal{U}_n=\exp\left[\int_{t_{n-1}}^{t_{n}} \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{tot}(t) \mathrm{d}t \right]$ are the propagators between time $t_{n-1}$ and $t_n$, where $\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{tot}(t) \: \cdot = - i \left[ H_\mathrm{tot}(t) , \:\cdot\:\right]$ is the Liouvillian for the total system.
Because we assume that the experimenter has no direct access to the environment we trace it out at the final time.
The object that encodes the outcome of all different control sequences $\{\mathcal{A}_1, \mathcal{A}_2, \mathcal{A}_3, \mathcal{A}_4\}$ can be easily identified as the red dotted region in Fig.~\ref{fig:process-tensor}a.
This is the process tensor as introduced in~\cite{pollock_non-markovian_2018}.
Through a reinterpretation of this quantum circuit as a tensor network one may note that the process tensor naturally assumes the form of a matrix product operator (PT-MPO).
Note that the particular MPO representation in Fig.~\ref{fig:process-tensor}a uses the environment Liouville space as bonds, which is prohibitively large for most systems of interest.
However, because there is no need to explicitly keep track of the environment, there often exists an efficient representation of the PT-MPO with low bond dimensions, which we draw in Fig.~\ref{fig:process-tensor}b.
As mentioned in the main text, there are several numerical methods that allow such a PT-MPO for multiple different types of environments to be obtained~\cite{makri_tensor_1995, makri_tensor_1995-1, banuls_matrix_2009, jorgensen_exploiting_2019, strathearn_modelling_2020, lerose_influence_2020, fux_efficient_2021, cygorek_simulation_2022, sonner_influence_2021, ye_constructing_2021, white_non-markovian_2021, thoenniss_non-equilibrium_2022, OQuPy2022, thoenniss_efficient_2022, ng_real_2022}.
The necessary bond dimensions of an PT-MPO is related to the degree of non-Markovianity of the interaction between the system and environment~\cite{pollock_operational_2018}.


In this paper we make use of a Suzuki-Trotter expansion~\cite{trotter_product_1959} of the unitary evolution of the total system \mbox{$H_\mathrm{tot} = H_\mathrm{S}(t) + H_B + H_{SB}$} into an environment interaction part and a pure system part. For small enough time steps the unitary evolution $\mathcal{U}_n$ can be separated into the unitary evolution $\tilde{\mathcal{U}}_n$ due to the environment interaction $\tilde{H} = H_{SB} + H_B$ and the unitary evolution $U_n$ due to the pure system part $H_\mathrm{S}(t)$ as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:process-tensor}c~and~\ref{fig:process-tensor}d.
One can then view the pure system propagators $U_n$ as control operations and the rest as a process tensor for a total system with the reduced total Hamiltonian $\tilde{H} = H_{SB} + H_B$ as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:process-tensor}d.

For the computations in the main text we employed the method introduced in~\cite{jorgensen_exploiting_2019} to obtain such a PT-MPO representation of the Trotterized time evolution. We used the implementation in the OQuPy package~\cite{OQuPy2022} with a time step $\Delta t = 0.03\ \text{ps}$, a memory cut-off of $K=60$ timesteps, and a relative singular value decomposition cutoff threshold of~$10^{-7}$. The most demanding calculations in the text are those for the longest duration, $T=5.0\;\mathrm{ps}$. The computation of the process tensor for this case took approximately $7$ minutes on a laptop (Macbook Pro with an 8 core Intel i9-9880H processor), and produced a PT-MPO with a maximal bond dimension of 234 which occupied 1 GB of memory. Propagating a state using this PT took 25 seconds. The optimization, over $N=332$ parameters, took approximately 45 minutes and converged in 37 iterations. The shorter durations are significantly easier: for $T=1.0\;\mathrm{ps}$ computing the process tensor took less than 1 second. The optimization, over $N=66$ parameters, took less than 3 seconds and converged in 6 iterations.

We emphasize that the method introduced in this work is not restricted to the particular choice of the environment or the particular choice of algorithm used to compute the PT-MPO.
The method only relies on the availability of the environment's PT-MPO with a moderate bond dimension, which may be obtained for a variety of different environments through a variety of different methods.

\section{Construction of the gradient from the process tensor}

\label{sec:suppgrad}

In this section we present details of how we calculate the gradient of an objective function from the PT-MPO. To establish notation we first recall the calculation of the time evolution from an initial to a final state, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:process-tensor}e and Fig. 1a of the main text. Recall that states here are vectorized system density matrices. The time evolution proceeds in discrete time steps at times $t_n=n\Delta t$ for $n=1,\ldots,N_t$. For a system with Hilbert space dimensionality $d_{H_S}$ the state at time $t_n$ is a $d_{H_S}^2$ component vector which we denote $\rho^i_n$ ($i=1,\ldots d_{H_S}^2$). The system propagator over the $n^{th}$ time step is a $(d_{H_S}^2,d_{H_S}^2)$ matrix we denote $U^{ij}_n$. 

Fig~\ref{fig:process-tensor}e shows the evolution over four time steps with time increasing from bottom to top. The state at the final time can be constructed by evaluating the contractions in this network forwards in time. One first contracts the lowest external leg of the PT-MPO with the leg of the initial state. The next two external legs of the PT-MPO are, in order, an output from it and an input to it. The output (input) leg of the PT-MPO is joined to the input (output) leg of the system propagator for the first time step. The propagators for the the next two time steps are included in a similar manner, thus interleaving the factors in the path integral due to the environment and the system Hamiltonian. The final step is a contraction of the last output leg of the PT-MPO with the input leg of the last system propagator. The resulting diagram has one open leg, the output leg of the last system propagator, and represents the final state.

In the main text we considered a particular objective function, the fidelity $\mathcal{F}$, and took as control parameters the fields $h_{x,z}(t_n)$. Here we consider a more general case where the objective is a function $Z(\rho^i_f=\rho_{N_t}^i)$ of the final state, and there are $N$ control parameters $c_a$. In general each propagator $U^{ij}_n$ can depend on all the control parameters. Thus we have \begin{equation}\label{eq:chainrule}
    \frac{\partial Z}{\partial c_a} = \sum_{n} \sum_{i,j,k}^{d_{H_S}^2} %\sum_t^{T}\sum_{i,j}^{d_{H_S}^2} 
    \frac{\partial Z}{\partial \rho_f^i} \frac{\partial\rho_f^i}{\partial U^{jk}_n} \frac{\partial U^{jk}_n}{\partial c_a}.\end{equation} 
    
Fig.\ \ref{fig:chainrule} shows Eq. (\ref{eq:chainrule}) for four time steps. The terms involving the propagators $U_1,\ldots,U_4$ are shown in panels (a)--(d) respectively. Panel (e) shows how panel (a) is formed from the three factors in Eq. (\ref{eq:chainrule}). The rank-1 tensor $Z^i\equiv\frac{\partial Z}{\partial \rho^i_f}$ is the purple circle at the top of the diagram, and the rank-2 tensor $\frac{\partial U^{jk}_1}{\partial c_a}$, for a given $a$, is the yellow circle at the first time step. The remainder of the diagram is the rank-3 tensor $\frac{\partial \rho_f^i}{\partial U_1^{jk}}$. As discussed in the main text, the PT is a multilinear map from the propagators to the final state. Thus the diagram for $\frac{\partial \rho_f^i}{\partial U_1^{jk}}$, for example, is the same as that for the final state, with the first propagator, $U_1$, omitted. Furthermore, the contraction of this tensor with $Z^i$ is the derivative of the objective function with respect to the first propagator, $\frac{\partial Z}{\partial U_1^{jk}}$. This important object is the diagram in Fig.\ \ref{fig:chainrule}a with the yellow circle omitted. The derivatives with respect to the propagators at other time steps are obtained similarly from Figs.\ \ref{fig:chainrule}b--d. 

To calculate Eq. (\ref{eq:chainrule}) we first compute the derivatives of the objective function with respect to the system propagators. This is done using two computations of the tensor network: a forward propagation, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:forwardprop}, and a back propagation, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:backprop}. In the forward propagation, we evaluate the network starting from the initial state and proceeding forward in time, as is done to compute the objective function itself. The only change is that we store the tensors obtained at each time step, shown in Figs.\ \ref{fig:forwardprop}b--e. Each stored tensor has two legs, one internal leg within the PT-MPO, known as a `bond' leg, and one external leg to the PT-MPO, which would normally have been connected to a system propagator, known as a `state' leg. The back propagation is shown in Fig.\ \ref{fig:backprop}. One evaluates this diagram starting from the top with the tensor $Z^i$ and proceeding backwards in time. One again retains the intermediate forms computed at each time step, shown in Figs.\ \ref{fig:backprop}b--e. We see that by joining the bond leg in Fig.\ \ref{fig:forwardprop}b with that in Fig.\ \ref{fig:backprop}e we obtain the derivative $\frac{\partial Z}{\partial U_1}$.  The other derivatives are obtained similarly from pairs of tensors stored during the forward and back propagation. These derivatives
are then combined with the factors $\frac{\partial U_n}{\partial c_a}$ to give the gradient. 

To connect these considerations to the special case considered in the main text, we note that there we wish to maximize the fidelity, $\mathcal{F}=(\mathrm{Tr} \sqrt{\sqrt{\rho_f}\sigma\sqrt{\rho_f}})^2$, between the density matrices describing the target state, $\sigma$, and the final system state, $\rho_f$. For a pure target state the density matrix is $\sigma=\ketbra{\sigma}{\sigma}$, and the fidelity simplifies to $\mathcal{F}=\langle\sigma|\rho_f|\sigma\rangle$. In Liouville space this is the scalar product of the vectorized forms of the final density matrix and the transposed target density matrix, $\mathcal{F}=(\sigma^T)^i \rho^i_f$. Thus, $Z^i=(\sigma^T)^i$, and the gradient of the fidelity is obtained by back propagation from the transposed target state as claimed. An additional simplification can be made when each control parameter only affects the propagator of a single time step (as in the presented example in the main text). In this case, for each of the control parameters only the corresponding time step $n$ in Eq.\ \ref{eq:chainrule} will contribute to the derivative of the objective function.

The purple circle at the top of each panel is the derivative of the objective function with respect to the final state. (e) shows how (a) is constructed by joining legs (contracting indices) among tensors corresponding to the factors in Eq. (\ref{eq:chainrule}).

\section{Quantum speed limits}

\label{sec:suppqsl}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{qslfigc.pdf}
    \caption{Quantum speed limits (right axis) for the optimal protocol, control A, as a function of process duration. Green/triangles: Campaioli et al. speed limit. Orange/circles: Deffner et al. speed limit. Black dashed line: process duration. The solid blue line shows, on the left axis, the infidelity.\label{sfig:qsl}}
    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}

Quantum speed limits (QSLs) are upper bounds on the speed of evolution between one quantum state and another, and therefore lower bounds on the time required for such a process. For unitary dynamics the unified Margolus-Levitin and Mandelstamm-Tamm bound is tight for certain states and, as discussed in the main text, gives the minimum time for the state transfer in the case of a closed system. Although various bounds have been obtained for open quantum systems, they are not expected to be tight for general evolutions~\cite{campaioli_tight_2019}. Nonetheless, it is interesting to consider the relation between the time of our optimal process and some QSLs for open systems. Fig.~\ref{sfig:qsl} shows the QSLs of Campaioli et al.~\cite{campaioli_tight_2019}, $T_{C}$, and Deffner et al.~\cite{deffner_quantum_2013}, $T_{D}$, for the evolutions obtained by our optimization, as a function of the process duration $T$. We also show the fidelity, as in the main text.  In the region of short process durations the tightest of the two bounds, $T_{C}$, reaches a significant fraction (around 80\%) of the process duration, but the limit is not reached. As we increase the process duration, the bounds increase more slowly than the process duration, and the state transfer is operating further and further from the open-system QSL. This is in line with our conclusion in the main text, that non-Markovian effects can lead to a trade-off between speed and fidelity.


\section{Supplemental results}
\label{sec:suppresults}

\subsection{Dynamics of information backflow}

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{supp_cum_backflow_fig.pdf}
  \caption{Cumulative information backflow as a function of time (left axis, thick lines) and Bloch vector lengths (right axis, thin lines), for the optimized control (control A, solid lines) and the unoptimized one (control B, dashed lines). Results are shown for the state transfer process of duration 4 ps.  }
  \label{fig:supp-backflow}
\end{figure}



In Fig.~\ref{fig:supp-backflow}, we explore how the information backflow evolves during the controls. The measure of non-Markovianity we use is defined by Eq. (1) in the main text; recall it is the cumulative increase in trace distance between trajectories starting from two states, calculated over the entire process, and maximized over all pairs of starting states. To explore how the information backflow varies with time for a given dynamics, we consider the pair of trajectories which maximize this measure over the entire process, and plot the cumulative increase in trace-distance up to a given time. The thick solid and dashed curves in Fig.~\ref{fig:supp-backflow} show this measure for the optimized control A and the unoptimized control B, as in the main text, for a process duration 4 ps. We also show, for comparison, the length of the Bloch vector under the two dynamics. It can be seen that, in the optimized process, information backflow is present for most of the process. This is excepting a small part at the beginning, when there would be in any case no information lost to the environment to recover, and at the end, when presumably all the information which could be restored from the environment has been.

\subsection{Optimization for alternate spectral densities}

\begin{figure}[ht]
\includegraphics{superohmic-doublecutoff-4ps-optimised.pdf}
\includegraphics{ohmicspectraldensity-4ps-optimised.pdf}
\caption{Optimized pulses and dynamics for different spectral densities. Both plots correspond to Fig. 3 of the main text, with a changed spectral density. For those on the left the cut-off is doubled to $6.08\,\text{ps}^{-1}$. For those on the right the super-Ohmic spectral density is changed to the corresponding Ohmic form, $J(\omega)=2\alpha\omega\exp\left[-\omega^2/\omega_c^2\right]$. The top panels show the driving fields $h_x(t)$ (green) and $h_z(t)$ (orange) for the optimal state transfer process, control A, of duration 4.0 ps. The lower panels show the dynamics of the components of the Bloch vector (left axis, green/solid: $\expval{\sigma_x}$ , blue/dot-dashed: $\expval{\sigma_y}$, orange/dashed: $\expval{\sigma_z}$), and length of the Bloch vector (right axis, black/solid). The length of the Bloch vector for control B is also shown (right axis, black/dashed).\label{supp:sdvaryfig}}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{superohmic-standardcutoff-4ps-hightemp-optimised.pdf}
\caption{Optimized pulse and dynamics at a temperature of 20 K. The plots correspond to Fig. 3 of the main text, and the parameters other than temperature are the same.\label{supp:hightfig}}
\end{figure}

In Figs.~\ref{supp:sdvaryfig} and \ref{supp:hightfig} we show how the optimal controls, and resulting dynamics, are affected by changing some aspects of the environment. These plots correspond to Fig.~3 of the main text, with different environment parameters. As discussed in the main text, we suggest that the optimized protocols act to partially undo the formation of the polaron, which occurs as different bath modes go out of phase with one another. This suggests that the oscillations in the control visible in Fig.~3 of the main text may correspond to the high-frequency cut-off of the spectral density,  $\omega_c$. The left plots in Fig.~\ref{supp:sdvaryfig} show the results of the optimization with twice the cut-off frequency, and it can be seen that the frequency of the oscillations in the control has indeed doubled. The right plots show results for an Ohmic spectral density (with the original cut-off), where we see that the optimal control is noticeably slower than the super-Ohmic case. This is consistent with the more significant role of low-frequency modes in Ohmic baths generally. The improvement produced by the optimization here is remarkable, given it otherwise has much stronger decoherence, as can be seen in the lengths of the Bloch vectors for the two cases. Finally, Fig.~\ref{supp:hightfig} shows the results at a higher temperature. This leads to stronger controls, and a lower final fidelity, than are obtained at lower temperatures. However, there is still a significant improvement after optimizing for the non-Markovian case.

\subsection{Description of supplementary results}

Fig. 3 of the main text showed the optimal controls and dynamics for a process duration of 4 ps. The file \verb|supplementary_results.pdf| shows the corresponding results for a range of process durations from 1 to 5 ps, with each page corresponding to a different duration. One can view this file in single-page mode and move between pages to generate an animation. The bottom left panel, which is repeated on every page, reproduces Fig. 2a of the main text. The infidelity of the optimal control (control A) is shown as a function of process duration as the blue curve. On each page one point on that curve is marked with a red cross. This indicates the process duration for which results are shown in the remaining panels. These are the computed optimal controls (top left), the time-dependence of the expectation values (top right) and the trajectory in the Bloch sphere (bottom right). The top right panel also shows the length of the Bloch vector for the unoptimized control (control B).

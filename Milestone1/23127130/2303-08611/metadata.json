    "abstract": "Fast and accurate auto-focus in adverse conditions remains an arduous task. The paper presents a polarity-based event camera auto-focus algorithm featuring high-speed, precise auto-focus in dark, dynamic scenes that conventional frame-based cameras cannot match. Specifically, the symmetrical relationship between the event polarities in focusing is investigated, and the event-based focus evaluation function is proposed based on the principles of the event cameras and the imaging model in the focusing process. Comprehensive experiments on the public EAD dataset show the robustness of the model. Furthermore, precise focus with less than one depth of focus is achieved within 0.004 seconds on our self-built high-speed focusing platform. The dataset and code will be made publicly available.",

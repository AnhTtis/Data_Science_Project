    "abstract": "In this paper, we use a class of finite state automata, called topology automaton, to study the metric classification of a special class of post-critically finite self-similar sets. As an application, we prove that the conformal dimension of post-critically finite self-similar dendrites and fractal gasket with connected component is 1.",

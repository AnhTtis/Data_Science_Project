This technique illustrates the relationship between changes in distributions of multiple antecedent feature values and the outcome distribution. We can also observe effects on the relative utilization of predictive rules. Our parallel histogram technique solves the over-plotting difficulty of parallel coordinate graphs and the difficulty of comparing distributions of brushed and original data. We demonstrate our technique's usefulness in understanding concept drifts in power demand and stock investment returns.},

abstract = {In recent years, many accurate decision support systems have been constructed as black boxes, that is as systems that hide their internal logic to the user. This lack of explanation constitutes both a practical and an ethical issue. The literature reports many approaches aimed at overcoming this crucial weakness, sometimes at the cost of sacrificing accuracy for interpretability. The applications in which black box decision systems can be used are various, and each approach is typically developed to provide a solution for a specific problem and, as a consequence, it explicitly or implicitly delineates its own definition of interpretability and explanation. The aim of this article is to provide a classification of the main problems addressed in the literature with respect to the notion of explanation and the type of black box system. Given a problem definition, a black box type, and a desired explanation, this survey should help the researcher to find the proposals more useful for his own work. The proposed classification of approaches to open black box models should also be useful for putting the many research open questions in perspective.},

Using consumer behavior data left on the Internet to predict repurchase behavior is of great significance for companies to achieve precision marketing. This paper proposes an improved deep forest model, and the interactive behavior characteristics of users and goods are added into the original feature model to predict the repurchase behavior of e-commerce consumers. Based on the Alibaba mobile e-commerce platform data set, first construct a feature engineering that includes user characteristics, product characteristics, and interactive behavior characteristics. And then use our proposed model to make predictions. Experiments show that the model’s overall performance with increased interactive behavior features is better and has higher accuracy. Compared with the existing prediction models, the improved deep forest model has certain advantages, which not only improves the prediction accuracy but also reduces the cost of training time.},

\section{ $\overline{B}$ inside the frozen window  \secl{Bfrozen}}
From \eqs{O-mn}{Bww} it follows that 
\beq
\overline{B}^b_{ln} = i\me{ u_l}{\Ham}{ \partial_b u_j\ww} U_{jn}
\eeq
And, if 
\beq
\Ham\ket{u_l} = \el \ket{u_l}
\eql{HuEu}
\eeq
then we may write 
\beq
\overline{B}^b_{ln} = \el \overline{A}_{ln}^{b}  \eql{B-frozen}
\eeq
However, in Wannier interpolation \eq{HuEu} is true only if the energy $\el$ is inside the frozen window. 
Otherwise, the wavefunctions $\ket{u_l}$ are not guaranteed to be eigenstates of the Hamiltonianm although the columns 
of $U$ are eigenvectors of $\Ham\ww$. Therefore, it is convenient, and computationally effective 
\stm{was it ever tested that such substitution actually improves interpolation?}
to evaluate $B^b_{ln}$ using \eq{B-frozen} when $\el$ lies in the frozen window, and use \eqs{O-mn}{Bww} otherwise.
However, such substitution becomes discontinuous at the points when a band crosses the borders of frozen window, 
which disables differentiation. 
So, we can intoroduce a smoothed version:
\begin{equation}
\wt{\overline{B}}{}^{b}_{ln}=f(\el)\el\overline{A}^b_{ln}+(1-f(\el))\overline{B}^{b}_{ln}
\end{equation}
Where $f(\varepsilon)$ is a smooth function, such that $f(\varepsilon)=1$ deep inside the frozen window, and $f(\varepsilon)=0$ far outside it.
The width of the transition region should be chosen rather narrow, but finite. Now, in order to be to use the rules 
of covariant derivative, let us write it in covariant form as
\begin{equation}
\wt{\overline{B}}{}^{b}_{ln}=f_{ll'}\Ham_{l'l''}\overline{A}^b_{l''n}+(1-f_{ll'})\overline{B}^{b}_{l'n}
\end{equation}
where  $f_{ll'}=\delta_{ll'}f(\el)$
%
To this equation we can directly apply the product rule \eqref{eq:gender-prod-rule}  
 and get
\xlm{Changed $V){ll'}^d$ to $\Ham_{l'l''}^{;d}$}
\begin{multline}
\wt{\overline{B}}{}^{b;d}_{ln}= 
    f_{ll'} \Ham_{l'l''}^{;d}\overline{A}^b_{l''n} +
 f^{;d}_{ll'} \Ham_{l'l''} \overline{A}^b_{l''n}-f^{;d}_{ll'}\overline{B}^{b}_{l'n} +\\
 + f_{ll'}\Ham_{l'l''}\overline{A}^{b;d}_{l''n} + \bigl(1-f_{ll'})\overline{B}^{b;d}_{l'n} 
\end{multline}
where $f_{ll'}$ is evaluated according to chainrule \eqref{eq:gender-chain-rule}.

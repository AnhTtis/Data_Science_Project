    "abstract": "We focus on heat kernel-based p-energy norms (1<p<\\infty) on bounded and unbounded metric measure spaces, in particular, weak-monotonicity properties for different types of energies. Such properties are key to related studies, under which we generalise the convergence result of Bourgain-Brezis-Mironescu (BBM) for p\\neq2. We establish the equivalence of various p-energy norms and weak-monotonicity properties when there admits a heat kernel satisfying the two-sided estimates. Using these equivalences, we verify various weak-monotonicity properties on nested fractals and their blowups. Immediate consequences are that, many classical results on p-energy norms hold for such bounded and unbounded fractals, including the BBM convergence and Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality.",

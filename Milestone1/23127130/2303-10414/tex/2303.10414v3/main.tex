\begin{abstract}
We investigate heat kernel-based and other $p$-energy norms ($1<p<\infty$) on bounded and
unbounded metric measure spaces, in particular, on nested fractals and their
blowups. With the weak-monotonicity properties for these norms,
we generalise the celebrated Bourgain-Brezis-Mironescu (BBM)
type characterization for $p\neq2$. When there admits a heat kernel
satisfying the two-sided estimates, we establish the equivalence of
various $p$-energy norms and weak-monotonicity properties, and show that
these weak-monotonicity properties hold when $p=2$ (in the case of Dirichlet
form). Our paper's key results concern the equivalence and verification of various weak-monotonicity
properties on fractals. Consequently, many classical results on $p$-energy norms
hold on nested fractals and their
blowups, including the BBM type characterization
and Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality.

%for different types of energies. Such properties are key to related studies,
%under which we generalise the convergence result of

%of various $p$-energy norms and weak-monotonicity properties when there
%admits a heat kernel satisfying the two-sided estimates.
%Using these equivalences, we verify various weak-monotonicity properties on nested fractals and their blowups.
%Immediate consequences are that, many classical

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Historical background and motivation}

Recently, there has been considerable development on the $p$-energy defined on
fractals and general metric measure spaces (initiated by
\cite{HermanPeironeStrichartz.2004.PA125}). For a smooth Euclidean domain $D$%
, the $p$-energy is simply defined as $\int_{D}|\nabla u(x)|^{p}dx$, but for many
fractals or metric measure spaces, it is not easy to define proper gradient
structures to characterize the smoothness of certain `core' functions arising
naturally from analysis. Previous constructions of $p$-energy ($1<p<\infty $%
) are based on the graph-approximation to the underlying space, including
p.c.f. self-similar sets by Cao, Gu and Qiu \cite{Caoqiugu2022adv}, the
Sierpi\'{n}ski carpet by Shimizu \cite{Shimuzu.2022} and more general
fractal spaces by Kigami \cite{Kigami2022penergy}.

In this paper, we consider another way to define $p$-energy norms by
equivalent Besov-type norms, which naturally generalises the energy of
Dirichlet forms when $p=2$, and the graph-approximation does not appear in
the definition. The heat kernel-based $p$-energy norms are introduced by
K.~Pietruska-Pa{\l }uba in \cite{Pietruska-Paluba.2010.}, and later heat
semigroup-based norms are studied by Alonso Ruiz, Baudoin et al. for $1\leq
p<\infty $ in \cite%
{AlonsoBaudoinchen2020JFA,AlonsoBaudoinchen2020CVPDE,AlonsoBaudoinchen2021CVPDE}%
, where they focus on generalising classical analysis results including
Sobolev embedding, isoperimetric inequalities and the class of bounded
variation functions. It is possible to use heat kernel-based $p$%
-energy norms to construct equivalent (or exactly the same) $p$-energy given
by the graph-approximation approach, to satisfy further restrictions like
convexity or self-similarity for self-similar sets, see for example \cite%
{Caoqiugu2022adv,GaoYuZhang2022PA}.

Recall the celebrated `Bourgain-Brezis-Mironescu (BBM) convergence' in \cite[%
Corollary 2]{BourgainBrezisMironescu.2001.439}:
\begin{equation}
\lim_{\sigma \uparrow 1}(1-\sigma )\int_{D}\int_{D}\frac{|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}}{%
|x-y|^{n+p\sigma }}dxdy=C_{n,p}\int_{D}|\nabla u(x)|^{p}dx \ \ \
(1<p<\infty),  \label{BBM}
\end{equation}%
where $D$ is a smooth domain in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, which states that
multiplying by a scaling factor $1-\sigma $, the fractional Gagliardo
semi-norms of a function converge to the first-order Sobolev semi-norm as $%
\sigma \rightarrow 1$. The BBM type characterization is the
convergence of Besov semi-norms $(\sigma ^{\ast }-\sigma )B_{p,p}^{\sigma }$
to $B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma ^{\ast }}$ on metric measure spaces, where $\sigma
^{\ast }$ is the critical exponent. Several papers have studied this, for
example, on fractals with `property (E)' \cite[Theorem 1.6]{GaoYuZhang2022PA}%
, and on spaces supporting a $p$-Poincar\'e inequality \cite{DS19,Munnier15}.%
%, for example Di Marino-Squassina and Munnier

We establish BBM type characterization on both bounded and
unbounded metric measure spaces under appropriate weak-monotonicity
properties (to replace property (E) on fractals). We utilize the concept of
property (KE) introduced in \cite[Definition 6.7]{AlonsoBaudoinchen2020JFA}
and (NE) defined in \cite[Definition 4.5]{BaudoinLecture2022} (all termed $%
P(p,\alpha )$ therein), and use (VE) for bounded and unbounded fractals
based on \cite[Definition 3.1]{GaoYuZhang2022PA}, where the letters `E'
stands for energy control and `K',`N',`V' represent (heat) kernel, (Besov)
norm, vertex respectively. Additionally, we explore their slightly weaker
variants by replacing `sup' with `limsup'.

These weak-monotonicity properties are certain energy-control conditions,
which is essentially required and important in all the studies related to $p$%
-energy (norms) mentioned above, to guarantee `some level of $L^p$
infinitesimal regularity and global controlled $L^p$ geometry' as \cite%
{BaudoinLecture2022} stated. In fractal analysis, weak-monotonicity appear
in the form of $p$-resistance estimate in \cite%
{Caoqiugu2022adv,Shimuzu.2022,Kigami2022penergy}, which is not easy to
obtain. Verifying the weak-monotonicity properties (KE), (NE) and (VE) is a
main contribution in our paper for certain fractal-type spaces, like nested
fractals and their blow-ups.

To do this, we establish the equivalence of (KE) and (NE) on metric measure
spaces, the equivalence of (NE) and (VE) on certain fractals (including
nested fractals), and then verify a relatively easier condition (VE) using
the arguments in a main theorem of \cite{Caoqiugu2022adv}. Such properties
are not easy to examine when $p\neq 2$ in general (but property (KE) holds
automatically when $p=2$). Alonso Ruiz, Baudoin et al. examined property
(KE) in the case $p=1$ using weak Bakry-Emery type hypothesis and $p\neq 2$
for spaces with the same critical exponent as Euclidean smooth manifolds
(see for example \cite[Lemma 4.13]{AlonsoBaudoinchen2021CVPDE}).
But for fractal-type spaces, different ideas are required, since the
critical exponents are different from manifolds (as in (\ref{BBM}), $%
\sigma^*=1$ for smooth manifolds; but even when $p=2$, $\sigma^*=\log15/%
\log9 $ on the Vicsek set \cite{BC23} and $\sigma^*=\log5/\log4$ on the
Sierpi\'nski gasket \cite{BP88}) and (bi-)linearity is missing.

%Alonso Ruiz,Kigami.2001.,
%Baudoin et al. established two analogues of classical analysis results under
%property (KE) or (NE) for $1<p<\infty $, that is, the Sobolev-type
%inequality in \cite[Theorem 1.1]{AlonsoBaudoinchen2020JFA} and the full
%scale of Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality introduced by \cite[Theorem 4.3 and
%Theorem 4.4]{BaudoinLecture2022}. The latter inequality only holds for
%unbounded spaces in \cite{BaudoinLecture2022}, and this motivates us to
%study unbounded fractals.  Recently,Yang in \cite[Theorem 2.8]{Yang23}, Murugan and Shimizu in \cite[Theorem 1.4]{MuruganShimizu23} prove (NE) respectively for generalized Sierpi\'nski carpets  in the case $p > \dim_{\text{ARC}}$ where $\dim_{\text{ARC}}$ is the Ahlfors regular conformal dimension. \underline{(INCORRECT)}

\subsection{Preliminaries}

\label{secPre}

\subsubsection{Basic definitions}

Let $(M,d,\mu )$ be a metric measure space,
that is, $(M,d)$\ is a locally
compact, separable metric space and $\mu $ is a Radon measure with full
support on $M$. Fix a value (which could be infinite)
\begin{equation*}
R_{0}\in (0,\mathrm{diam}(M)]
\end{equation*}
that will be used for localization throughout the paper, where
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{diam}(M):=\sup \{d(x,y):x,y\in M\}\in (0,\infty]
\end{equation*}
is infinite if $M$ is unbounded and is finite if $M$ is bounded.

The measure $\mu$ is assumed to be Borel regular with the following
positivity and \emph{volume doubling property}: there exists a constant $%
C_{d}>0$ such that for every $x\in M$, $0<r<\infty $,
\begin{equation}
0<\mu (B(x,2r))\leq C_{d}\mu (B(x,r))<\infty,  \label{VD1}
\end{equation}%
where $B(x,r):=\{y\in M:d(x,y)<r\}$ denotes the open metric ball centered at
$x\in M$ with radius $r>0$. Denote
\begin{equation*}
V(x,r):=\mu (B(x,r)).
\end{equation*}%
It is known from \cite[Proposition 5.1]{GrigoryanHu.2014.MMJ505} that if %
\eqref{VD1} holds, then there exists $\alpha _{1}>0$ such that
\begin{equation}
\frac{V(x,R)}{V(x,r)}\leq C_{d}\left( \frac{R}{r}\right) ^{\alpha _{1}},
\label{VD2}
\end{equation}%
for all $x\in M$, $0<r\leq R<\infty$.

For $\alpha>0$, we say that $\mu $ is \emph{$\alpha $-regular} if there exists a constant $%
C\geq 1$ such that for all $0<r<R_{0}$,
\begin{equation}
C^{-1}r^{\alpha }\leq V(x,r)\leq Cr^{\alpha }.  \label{alpha_r}
\end{equation}%
We remark that when $\mu $ is $\alpha $-regular, then (\ref{VD2}) holds with
$\alpha _{1}=\alpha $.

A family $\{p_{t}\}_{t>0}$ of non-negative measurable functions on $M \times
M$ is a \emph{heat kernel} if it satisfies: (\romannumeral 1) $p_t(x,y) =
p_t(y,x)$, (\romannumeral 2) $\int_M p_t(x,y)d\mu(y) \leq 1$, (\romannumeral %
3) $p_{s+t}(x,y)=\int_{M}p_{s}(x,z)p_{t}(z,y)d\mu (z)$, and (\romannumeral %
4) for any $f\in L^{2}(M,\mu )$, $\int_{M}p_{t}(x,y)f(y)d\mu (y)\rightarrow
f(x)$ \ as$~~t\downarrow 0$, strongly in$~~L^{2}(M,\mu )$ for $\mu $-almost
all $x,y\in M$ and $s,t>0$.

For some parameter $\beta ^{\ast }>1$, we consider the following two
conditions on the heat kernel.

We say that a heat kernel $\{p_{t}\}_{t>0}$ satisfies the upper estimate
(UHE), if for all $t\in (0,R_{0}^{\beta ^{\ast }}) $ and $\mu $-almost all $%
x,y\in M$,
\begin{equation}
p_{t}(x,y)\leq \frac{c_{3}}{V(x,t^{1/\beta ^{\ast }})}\exp \left(
-c_{4}\left( \frac{d(x,y)}{t^{1/\beta ^{\ast }}}\right) ^{\frac{\beta ^{\ast
}}{\beta ^{\ast }-1}}\right).  \label{UHE}
\end{equation}

We say that a heat kernel $\{p_{t}\}_{t>0}$ satisfies the lower estimate
(LHE), if for all $t\in (0,R_{0}^{\beta ^{\ast }}) $ and $\mu $-almost all $%
x,y\in M$,
\begin{equation}
p_{t}(x,y)\geq \frac{c_{1}}{V(x,t^{1/\beta ^{\ast }})}\exp \left(
-c_{2}\left( \frac{d(x,y)}{t^{1/\beta ^{\ast }}}\right) ^{\frac{\beta ^{\ast
}}{\beta ^{\ast }-1}}\right).  \label{LHE}
\end{equation}

%\textcolor{red}{It is easy to see that $(\mathrm{LHE})\Rightarrow (\mathrm{NLE})$. If the metric $d$ is furthermore assumed to satisfy the chain condition, then the conjunction
%	of $(\mathrm{LHE})$ and $(\mathrm{NLE})$ is equivalent to the two-sided estimates $(\mathrm{LHE})$ and $(\mathrm{UHE})$, see \cite[Section 6]{GrigoryanTelcs.2012.AoP1212}.}
%\textbf{[[delete]]}We say that a \emph{heat kernel} $\{p_{t}\}_{t>0}$
%satisfies the\emph{\ two-sided} heat kernel estimates, if for all $t\in
%(0,R_{0}^{\beta ^{\ast }}) $ and $\mu $-almost all $x,y\in M$ :
%\begin{equation}
%\frac{c_{1}}{V(x,t^{1/\beta ^{\ast }})}\exp \left( -c_{2}\left( \frac{d(x,y)%
%}{t^{1/\beta ^{\ast }}}\right) ^{\frac{\beta ^{\ast }}{\beta ^{\ast }-1}%
%}\right) \leq p_{t}(x,y)\leq \frac{c_{3}}{V(x,t^{1/\beta ^{\ast }})}\exp
%\left( -c_{4}\left( \frac{d(x,y)}{t^{1/\beta ^{\ast }}}\right) ^{\frac{\beta
%^{\ast }}{\beta ^{\ast }-1}}\right) ,  \label{hk}
%\end{equation}%
%where $\beta ^{\ast }>1$ is a fixed number. It is known that, when $R_0=%
%\mathrm{diam}(M)$, the two-sided estimates \eqref{hk} are equivalent to the
%conjunction of the chain condition (see \cite[Definition 3.4]%
%{GrigoryanHuLau.2003.TAMS2065}) the volume doubling property, the
%scale-invariant elliptic Harnack inequality and the mean exit time estimate
%on metric measure spaces (see \cite[Corollary 1.8]{Murugan.2020.JFA}, \cite[%
%Corollary 7.6]{GrigoryanTelcs.2012.AoP1212}).

Conditions (UHE) and (LHE) hold for many classical cases. The classical
Gauss-Weierstrass function
\begin{equation}
p_{t}(x,y)=\frac{1}{(4\pi t)^{n/2}}\exp \left( -\frac{|x-y|^{2}}{4t}\right) ,
\label{Gau-Wei}
\end{equation}%
is a heat kernel for the standard Brownian motion in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Li and Yau have shown in
\cite{LiYau.1986.AM153} that, for a complete Riemannian manifold with
non-negative Ricci curvature, two-sided estimates (UHE) and (LHE) hold with $%
\beta ^{\ast }=2$:
\begin{equation}
p_{t}(x,y)\asymp \frac{C}{V(x,\sqrt{t})}\exp \left( -\frac{d(x,y)^{2}}{ct}%
\right) ,  \label{LiYau}
\end{equation}%
where $d$ is the geodesic metric and $V(x,r)$ is the Riemannian volume. The
following two-sided heat kernel estimates
\begin{equation}
p_{t}(x,y)\asymp \frac{C}{t^{\alpha /\beta ^{\ast }}}\exp \left( -c\left(
\frac{d(x,y)}{t^{1/\beta ^{\ast }}}\right) ^{\frac{\beta ^{\ast }}{\beta
^{\ast }-1}}\right)  \label{hk_F}
\end{equation}%
also hold on many fractal spaces with different $\beta ^{\ast }$, such as the Sierpi\'{n}ski carpet and
nested fractals \cite%
{BarlowBass.1992.PTRF307,BarlowBass.1999.CJM673,FitzsimmonsmHamblyKumagai.1994.CMP595,Kumagai.1993.PTaRF205}%
.
%In fact, estimates \eqref{hk_F} imply that $\mu $ is $\alpha $-regular (see for example \cite[Theorem 3.2]{GrigoryanHuLau.2003.TAMS2065}). In addition, two-sided estimates \eqref{hk} and the volume doubling property hold on scale irregular Sierpi\'{n}ski gaskets (see \cite%{BarlowHambaly.1997.AIHS}, \cite[Theorem 5.1]{KajinoMurugan.2020On}).

\subsubsection{Besov and Korevaar-Schoen norms}
From now on we fix $p\in (1,\infty)$.
As in \cite{BaudoinLecture2022}, for $\sigma >0$, define semi-norms $%
[u]_{B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma }}$ for $u\in L^{p}(M,\mu )$ by
\begin{equation}
\lbrack u]_{B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma }}^{p}:=\sup_{r\in (0,R_{0})}r^{-p\sigma
}\int_{M}\frac{1}{V(x,r)}\int_{B(x,r)}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}d\mu (y)d\mu (x),
\label{pi}
\end{equation}%
and define
\begin{equation*}
B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma }:=B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma }(M)=\{u\in L^{p}(M,\mu
):[u]^p_{B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma }}<\infty \}.
\end{equation*}%
Naturally, define semi-norms $[u]_{B_{p,p}^{\sigma }}$ by
\begin{equation}
\lbrack u]_{B_{p,p}^{\sigma }}^{p}:=\int_{0}^{R_{0}}r^{-p\sigma }\left(
\int_{M}\frac{1}{V(x,r)}\int_{B(x,r)}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}d\mu (y)d\mu (x)\right)
\frac{dr}{r},  \label{pp}
\end{equation}%
and define
\begin{equation*}
B_{p,p}^{\sigma }:=B_{p,p}^{\sigma }(M)=\{u\in L^{p}(M,\mu
):[u]^p_{B_{p,p}^{\sigma }}<\infty \}.
\end{equation*}

The space $B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma }$ coincides with the Korevaar-Schoen space
$KS_{p,\infty }^{\sigma }$ in \cite[Section 4.2]{BaudoinLecture2022} with
the following different semi-norm (switch `sup' to `limsup')
\begin{equation}
\Vert u\Vert^p _{KS_{p,\infty }^{\sigma }}=\limsup_{r\rightarrow 0}\int_{M}%
\frac{1}{V(x,r)}\int_{B(x,r )}\frac{|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}}{r ^{p\sigma }}d\mu
(y)d\mu (x)<\infty.  \label{ks_energy1}
\end{equation}

In our paper, we define the \emph{critical exponent of $(M,d,\mu )$} by%
\begin{equation*}
\sigma _{p}^{\#}=\sup \{\sigma >0:B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma }\text{ contains
non-constant functions}\}.
\end{equation*}%
In many related studies the critical exponent is defined by
\begin{equation*}
\sigma _{p}^{\ast }=\sup \{\sigma >0:B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma }\text{ is dense
in }L^{p}(M,\mu )\}.
\end{equation*}

%and we will meet these two exponents in the last section.
Clearly, $\sigma _{p}^{\ast }\leq \sigma _{p}^{\#}$. Whenever the critical
exponents appear in our paper, we assume that they are finite. It is
known by \cite[Theorem 4.2]{BaudoinLecture2022} that when the chain
condition holds, then
\begin{equation*}
\sigma _{p}^{\#}\leq 1+\frac{\alpha_1}{p}<\infty .
\end{equation*}

\subsubsection{Heat kernel-based $p$-energy norm}

It is well-known that, a heat kernel $\{p_{t}\}_{t>0}$ can induce a
Dirichlet form on $L^{2}(M,\mu )$ given by
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{E}(u,u)& =\lim_{t\rightarrow 0^{+}}\mathcal{E}_{t}(u,u),\ u\in
L^{2}(M,\mu) \\
\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{E})& =\{u\in L^{2}(M,\mu ):\mathcal{E}(u,u)<\infty \}
\end{align*}%
(see \cite[Section 1.3]{FukushimaOshimaTakeda.2011.489}), where
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{E}_{t}(u,u):=\frac{1}{2t}\int_{M}\int_{M}|u(x)-u(y)|^{2}p_{t}(x,y)d%
\mu (y)d\mu (x).  \label{E_t}
\end{equation}%
The limit exists, since for any given $u\in L^{2}(M,\mu )$, $
\mathcal{E}_{t}(u,u)$ decreases in $t$ by using the spectral theorem.

In view of this, we adapt the heat kernel-based norms in \cite%
{AlonsoBaudoinchen2020JFA} and \cite{Pietruska-Paluba.2010.} to define the $p$%
-energy norm on $L^{p}(M,\mu )$ for a heat kernel $\{p_{t}\}_{t>0}$ as
\begin{equation*}
E_{p,\infty }^{\sigma }(u):=\sup_{t\in (0,R_{0}^{\beta ^{\ast }})}\frac{1}{%
t^{{p\sigma }/{\beta ^{\ast }}}}\int_{M}\int_{M}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}p_{t}(x,y)d%
\mu (y)d\mu (x),
\end{equation*}%
with its domain
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{D}(E_{p,\infty }^{\sigma }):=\{u\in L^{p}(M,\mu ):E_{p,\infty
}^{\sigma }(u)<\infty \}.
\end{equation*}%
This is a natural way to extend the Dirichlet form case for $p=2$ to $p\in
(1,\infty)$, and we will call them heat kernel-based $p$-energy norms. The
heat kernel-based $p$-energy norm $E_{p,\infty }^{\sigma_{p}^{\#}}$ is
equivalent to the $p$-energy on certain fractals (see Section \ref{sec5}).

To extend the BBM type characterization from $p=2$ to $%
1<p<\infty$, it is quite natural to define
\begin{equation*}
E_{p,p}^{\sigma }(u):=\int_{0}^{R_{0}^{\beta ^{\ast }}}\frac{1}{t^{{p\sigma }%
/{\beta ^{\ast }}}}\left( \int_{M}\int_{M}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}p_{t}(x,y)d\mu
(x)d\mu (y)\right) \frac{dt}{t},
\end{equation*}%
with domain
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{D}(E_{p,p}^{\sigma }):=\{u\in L^{p}(M,\mu ):E_{p,p}^{\sigma
}(u)<\infty \}.
\end{equation*}
It is known that (see for example \cite{Pietruska-Paluba.2008}), when the
two-sided heat kernel estimates hold, the proper scaling of $E_{2,2}^{\sigma
} $ converges to $E_{2,\infty }^{\sigma _{2}^{\#}}$ thanks to the fact that $%
E_{2,2}^{\sigma }$ is equivalent to the Dirichlet form defined by the
subordinated heat kernel. Additionally, we explore the convergence of heat
kernel-based $p$-energy norms $E_{p,p}^{\sigma }$ to $E_{p,\infty }^{\sigma
_{p}^{\#}}$. However, $E_{p,p}^{\sigma }$ does not seem to be the $p $%
-energy norm of the subordinated heat kernel, so we need weak-monotonicity
properties to replace the subordination technique for $p=2$ (see Theorem \ref{thm4.1}).

\subsection{Weak-monotonicity properties and main results}

We introduce some notions that will be used in defining weak-monotonicity properties and rewrite the above norms in the following way. For $u\in L^{p}(M,\mu )$ and $\sigma ,t>0$, denote
\begin{equation}
\Psi _{u}^{\sigma }(t)=\frac{1}{t^{{p\sigma }/{\beta ^{\ast }}}}%
\int_{M}\int_{M}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}p_{t}(x,y)d\mu (y)d\mu (x),  \label{psi_u}
\end{equation}%
then
\begin{equation}
E_{p,\infty }^{\sigma }(u)=\sup_{t\in (0,R_{0}^{\beta ^{\ast }})}\Psi
_{u}^{\sigma }(t),\ E_{p,p}^{\sigma }(u)=\int_{0}^{R_{0}^{\beta ^{\ast
}}}\Psi _{u}^{\sigma }(t)\frac{dt}{t}.  \label{EEE}
\end{equation}

Similarly, for Besov norms, denote
\begin{equation}
\Phi _{u}^{\sigma }(r)=r^{-p\sigma }\int_{M}\frac{1}{V(x,r)}%
\int_{B(x,r)}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}d\mu (y)d\mu (x),  \label{phi_u}
\end{equation}%
then
\begin{equation*}

\end{equation*}

\begin{definition}
We say that a metric measure space $(M,d,\mu )$ with heat kernel $%
\{p_{t}\}_{t>0}$ satisfies property ($\normalfont{KE}$) with $\sigma>0$, if
there exists a constant $C>0$ such that for all $u\in \mathcal{D}%
(E_{p,\infty }^{\sigma })$,
\begin{equation}  \label{KE}
\sup_{t\in (0,R_{0}^{\beta ^{\ast }})}\Psi _{u}^{\sigma }(t)\leq
C\liminf_{t\rightarrow 0}\Psi _{u}^{\sigma }(t),  \tag{\normalfont{KE}}
\end{equation}
where $\Psi _{u}^{\sigma }(t)$ is defined as in \eqref{psi_u}. We further
say that property ($\widetilde{KE}$) is satisfied with $\sigma >0$, if there
exists a constant $C>0$ such that for all $u\in \mathcal{D}(E_{p,\infty
}^{\sigma }) $,
\begin{equation}  \label{wKE}
\limsup_{t\rightarrow 0}\Psi _{u}^{\sigma }(t)\leq C\liminf_{t\rightarrow
0}\Psi _{u}^{\sigma }(t),  \tag{$\widetilde{KE}$}
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
\label{rk1}When $p=2$, property (KE) automatically holds
with $\sigma =\beta ^{\ast }/2$ as $\mathcal{E}_{t}(u,u)$ decrease in $t$.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}
We say that a metric measure space $(M,d,\mu )$ satisfies property ($%
\normalfont{NE}$) with $\sigma >0$ if there exists $C>0$ such that for all $%
u\in B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma }$,
\begin{equation}  \label{NE1}
\sup_{r\in (0,R_{0})}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma }(r)\leq C\liminf_{r\rightarrow
0}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma }(r).  \tag{\normalfont{NE}}
\end{equation}%
In addition, we say that property ($\widetilde{NE}$) is satisfied with $%
\sigma >0$, if there exists $C>0$ such that for all $u\in B_{p,\infty
}^{\sigma }$,
\begin{equation}  \label{wNE}
\limsup_{r\rightarrow 0}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma }(r)\leq C\liminf_{r\rightarrow
0}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma }(r).  \tag{$\widetilde{NE}$}
\end{equation}
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
It is known by Baudoin in \cite[Lemma 4.7]{BaudoinLecture2022} that property
(NE) is satisfied with some $\sigma >0$, then $\sigma \geq \sigma _{p}^{\#}$%
. So property (NE) is only interested when $\sigma=\sigma _{p}^{\#},$ and
whenever we say that property (NE) is satisfied, we automatically assume $%
\sigma=\sigma _{p}^{\#}$. Very recently, property (NE) is verified on nested fractals by Chang and the
authors \cite[Theorem 2.3]{CGYZ24} with the help of a lemma in this paper, on Sierpi\'nski carpets for $%
p>\dim_{ARC}(K, d)$ by Yang \cite[Theorem 2.8]{Yang23} and for all $p>1$ by
Murugan and Shimizu \cite[Theorem 1.4]{MuruganShimizu23}. Kajino and Shimizu
\cite[Section 5]{KS24} also show property (NE) under `$p$-contraction
property' based on Kigami's partition of metric spaces \cite{Kigami2022penergy}.\end{remark}

Our first result is that, two kinds of BBM type characterization under (KE) and (NE) are
established in Theorem \ref{thm4.1} and Theorem \ref{thm4.2}, without using
 heat kernel estimates.


Our second result is that, under the two-sided heat kernel estimates, we show the equivalence of the
heat kernel-based $p$-energy norms and Besov-Korevaar-Schoen norms on
bounded and unbounded metric measure spaces in Lemma \ref{thm1}, and the following weak-monotonicity equivalence.

\begin{theorem}
\label{thm4}If a metric measure space $(M,d,\mu )$ admits a heat kernel $%
\{p_{t}\}_{t>0}$ satisfying (UHE) and (LHE), then we have
the following equivalences:

\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)~] $(\widetilde{KE})\Longleftrightarrow (\widetilde{NE})$ with the
same $\sigma>0$,

\item[(ii)] $(KE)\Longleftrightarrow (NE)$ with the same $\sigma>0$.
\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

Our rest results focus on fractals. In what follows, we assume that $K$ is a connected homogeneous p.c.f. self-similar set.
Let $\alpha =\func{dim}_{H}(K)$ and denote the $\mathcal{H}%
^{\alpha }$-measure of $K$ by $\mu $. Let $K^{F}:=\bigcup_{f\in F}f(K)$ be
a fractal glue-up where $F$ is a proper set of functions (see details in
Subsection \ref{subsec5.1}) and we equip it with a natural glue-up measure $\mu ^{F}$ as in (\ref%
{muF}). This notion is used to unify bounded and unbounded fractals.
Following the definitions for $K$ in \cite{GaoYuZhang2022PA}, we define
\begin{equation}
E_{n}^{(p)}(u):=\sum_{x,y\in V_{w},|w|=n}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}\text{ \ \ and\ \ \ }%
\mathcal{E}_{n}^{\sigma }(u):=\rho ^{-n(p\sigma -\alpha )}E_{n}^{(p)}(u),
\label{EE}
\end{equation}%
then the local $p$-energy norm on $K^{F}$ is given by
\begin{equation}
E_{n}^{(p),F}(u):=\sum_{f\in F}\sum_{x,y\in V_{w},|w|=n}|u\circ f(x)-u\circ
f(y)|^{p}=\sum_{f\in F}E_{n}^{(p)}(u\circ f),  \label{p_energy}
\end{equation}%
and $\mathcal{E}_{n}^{\sigma ,F}(u)=\rho ^{-n(p\sigma -\alpha
)}E_{n}^{(p),F}(u)$.

\begin{definition}
\label{ve} We say that a fractal glue-up $K^{F}$ satisfies property ($%
\normalfont{VE}$) with $\sigma >0$, if there exists a constant $C>0$ such that for all $%
u \in L^p(K^{F},\mu^F)$,
\begin{equation}  \label{VE}
\sup_{n\geq 0}\mathcal{E}_{n}^{\sigma ,F}(u)\leq C\liminf_{n\rightarrow
\infty }\mathcal{E}_{n}^{\sigma ,F}(u).  \tag{\normalfont{VE}}
\end{equation}
We say that a fractal glue-up $K^{F}$ satisfies property ($\widetilde{VE}$)
with $\sigma >0$, if there exists $C>0$ such that for all $u \in
L^p(K^{F},\mu^F)$,
\begin{equation}  \label{wVE}
\limsup_{n\rightarrow \infty }\mathcal{E}_{n}^{\sigma ,F}(u)\leq
C\liminf_{n\rightarrow \infty }\mathcal{E}_{n}^{\sigma ,F}(u).
\tag{$\widetilde{VE}$}
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

The proof of the following equivalence is more delicate, which involves proper
truncation, an improvement of the $p$%
-energies equivalence in \cite{GaoYuZhang2022PA} with ring-splitting, and comparing the vertex-energies of different levels. Also, analysis on unbounded fractals requires more arguments than the bounded cases.
%The notion $C_H$ in the following theorem is.

\begin{theorem}
\label{thm5}Let $K^{F}$ be a fractal glue-up, where $K$ is a connected
homogeneous p.c.f. self-similar set, then we have the following equivalences:

\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)~] $(\widetilde{VE}) \Longleftrightarrow (\widetilde{NE})$ with the
same $\sigma>\alpha /p$;

\item[(ii)] $(VE) \Longleftrightarrow (NE)$ when $\sigma=\sigma
_{p}^{\#}>\alpha /p$ and $R_0=C_H$ (a positive number determined by $K^{F}$).
\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

%which  simply to divide integral in a ball into a summation of integrals over annuli see Lemma \ref{lem6.3}.

\begin{remark}
The equivalence of integral-type properties (KE, NE) and discrete-type (VE)
does not rely on the p.c.f. property, but it requires the
continuity of the functions in $B_{p,\infty}^{\sigma}$. The reason why we
consider p.c.f. fractals is to avoid complexity in defining (VE) properly,
and also verifying (VE) is relatively easier under the p.c.f. property (see
Proposition \ref{prop:critical}).
\end{remark}

Theorem \ref{thm4} and Theorem \ref{thm5} are very important in our paper
with many corollaries. In Section \ref{subsec5.4}, we will apply them to
obtain Corollary \ref{corol1.8}, and further deduce Theorem \ref{corol1.9} focusing
on nested fractals and their blowups. Moreover, they also deduce Corollary %
\ref{jjjj} and Corollary \ref{jjj} that are important to Dirichlet forms
when $p=2$.

\subsection{Structure of the paper}

The organization of the paper is as follows. In Section \ref{sec4}, we establish BBM type characterization
under appropriate weak-monotonicity properties (Theorem \ref{thm4.1} and Theorem \ref{thm4.2}). In Section \ref{sec2}, we demonstrate the equivalence between heat kernel-based and Besov-Korevaar-Schoen $p$-energy norms under two-sided estimates (Lemma \ref{thm1}), and the equivalence of the corresponding weak-monotonicity properties (Theorem \ref{thm4}). In Section \ref{sec5}, we study fractal glue-ups $K^F$. In
Subsection \ref{subsec5.1}, we introduce necessary geometric properties of $K^F$ and present some useful lemmas. In Subsection \ref{subsec5.2},
we verify (VE) for nested fractal glue-ups. In Subsection \ref{subsec5.3}, we prove Theorem \ref{thm5}. In Subsection \ref{subsec5.4}, we show that the BBM type characterization
and Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality hold true for nested fractal blow-ups (Theorem \ref{corol1.9}).

\textbf{Notation}: The letters $C$, $C^{\prime }$, $C_{i}$,$C_{i}^{\prime }$, 
$C_{i}^{\prime\prime }$, $c$ are universal positive constants depending only
on $M$ which may vary at each occurrence. The sign $\asymp $ means that both
$\leq $ and $\geq $ are true with uniform values of $C$ depending only on $M$%
. $a\wedge b:=\min \{a,b\}$, $a\vee b:=\max \{a,b\}$.

\section{Consequence of (KE) and (NE): BBM type characterization%
}

\label{sec4} In this section, we present our BBM type characterization
for heat kernel-based and Besov-Korevaar-Schoen $p$-energy norms. Under the settings in Section \ref%
{sec2}, these two BBM type characterization results will
coincide.

\subsection{BBM type characterization for heat kernel-based $p$%
-energy norms}

In our proof, we need the following embedding relation.

\begin{proposition}
\label{Prop32}For any $\delta \in (0,\sigma )$, we have
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{D}(E_{p,\infty }^{\sigma })\subseteq
\mathcal{D}(E_{p,p}^{\sigma -\delta }).   \label{306}
\end{equation}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
By the elementary inequality $|a-b|^{p}\leq 2^{p-1}(|a|^{p}+|b|^{p})$ and
symmetry, we have
\begin{align}
& \int_{M}\int_{M}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}p_{t}(x,y)d\mu (x)d\mu (y)  \notag \\
\leq & 2^{p-1}\int_{M}\int_{M}(|u(x)|^{p}+|u(y)|^{p})p_{t}(x,y)d\mu (x)d\mu
(y)  \notag \\
=& 2^{p}\int_{M}|u(x)|^{p}\left( \int_{M}p_{t}(x,y)d\mu (y)\right) d\mu
(x)\leq 2^{p}\Vert u\Vert _{p}^{p}.  \label{304}
\end{align}

Fix $\epsilon \in (0,R_{0}^{\beta ^{\ast }})$. By \eqref{304},%
\begin{eqnarray*}
E_{p,p}^{\sigma -\delta }(u) &=&\int_{0}^{R_{0}^{\beta ^{\ast }}}\frac{1}{t^{%
{p(\sigma -\delta )}/{\beta ^{\ast }}}}\left(
\int_{M}\int_{M}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}p_{t}(x,y)d\mu (x)d\mu (y)\right) \frac{dt}{t}
\\
&\leq &\int_{0}^{\epsilon }\frac{1}{t^{{p(\sigma -\delta )}/{\beta ^{\ast }}}%
}\left( \int_{M}\int_{M}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}p_{t}(x,y)d\mu (x)d\mu (y)\right)
\frac{dt}{t} \\
&&+\int_{\epsilon }^{\infty }\frac{1}{t^{{p(\sigma -\delta )}/{\beta ^{\ast }%
}}}\left( \int_{M}\int_{M}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}p_{t}(x,y)d\mu (x)d\mu (y)\right)
\frac{dt}{t} \\
&\leq &\int_{0}^{\epsilon }t^{-1+p\delta /{\beta ^{\ast }}}dt\sup_{t\in
(0,R_{0}^{\beta ^{\ast }})}\Psi _{u}^{\sigma }(t)+2^{p}\Vert u\Vert
_{p}^{p}\int_{\epsilon }^{\infty }\frac{dt}{t^{1+{p(\sigma -\delta )}/{\beta
^{\ast }}}} \\
&=&\frac{{\beta ^{\ast }}\epsilon ^{p\delta /{\beta ^{\ast }}}}{p\delta }%
\sup_{t\in (0,R_{0}^{\beta ^{\ast }})}\Psi _{u}^{\sigma }(t)+2^{p}\Vert
u\Vert _{p}^{p}\frac{{\beta ^{\ast }}\epsilon ^{-p(\sigma -\delta )/{\beta
^{\ast }}}}{p(\sigma -\delta )} \\
&=&\frac{{\beta ^{\ast }}\epsilon ^{p\delta /{\beta ^{\ast }}}}{p\delta }%
E_{p,\infty }^{\sigma }(u)+\frac{2^{p}{\beta ^{\ast }}\Vert u\Vert _{p}^{p}}{%
p(\sigma -\delta )}\epsilon ^{-p(\sigma -\delta )/{\beta ^{\ast }}}<\infty ,
\end{eqnarray*}%
thus showing \eqref{306}.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
\label{thm4.1} Suppose that $(M,d,\mu )$ satisfies property (KE) with $\tilde{\sigma}_{p}>0$ and heat kernel $\{p_{t}\}_{t>0}$
. Then there exists a
positive constant $C$ such that for all $u\in \mathcal{D}(B_{p,\infty }^{%
\tilde{\sigma}_{p}})$,
\begin{equation}
C^{-1}{E}_{p,\infty }^{\tilde{\sigma}_{p}}(u)\leq \liminf_{\sigma \uparrow
\tilde{\sigma}_{p}}(\tilde{\sigma}_{p}-\sigma ){E}_{p,p}^{\sigma }(u)\leq
\limsup_{\sigma \uparrow \tilde{\sigma}_{p}}(\tilde{\sigma}_{p}-\sigma ){E}%
_{p,p}^{\sigma }(u)\leq C{E}_{p,\infty }^{\tilde{\sigma}_{p}}(u).
\label{eq5.1}
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $u\in \mathcal{D}(E_{p,\infty }^{\tilde{\sigma _{p}}})$ and $\sigma \in
(0,\tilde{\sigma}_{p})$. By Proposition \ref{Prop32}, $u\in \mathcal{D}%
(E_{p,p}^{\sigma })$. Note that $\Psi _{u}^{\sigma }(t)=t^{p(\tilde{\sigma}%
_{p}-\sigma )/{\beta ^{\ast }}}\Psi _{u}^{\tilde{\sigma}_{p}}(t).$

For the left-hand side, by \eqref{EEE}, we have
\begin{align}
\liminf_{\sigma \uparrow \tilde{\sigma}_{p}}(\tilde{\sigma}_{p}-\sigma ){E}%
_{p,p}^{\sigma }(u)=& \liminf_{\sigma \uparrow \tilde{\sigma}_{p}}(\tilde{%
\sigma}_{p}-\sigma )\int_{0}^{R_{0}^{{\beta ^{\ast }}}}t^{p(\tilde{\sigma}%
_{p}-\sigma )/{\beta ^{\ast }}}\Psi _{u}^{\tilde{\sigma}_{p}}(t)\frac{dt}{t}
\notag \\
\geq & \liminf_{\sigma \uparrow \tilde{\sigma}_{p}}(\tilde{\sigma}%
_{p}-\sigma )\int_{0}^{\tilde{\sigma}_{p}-\sigma }t^{p(\tilde{\sigma}%
_{p}-\sigma )/{\beta ^{\ast }}}\Psi _{u}^{\tilde{\sigma}_{p}}(t)\frac{dt}{t}
\notag \\
\geq & \liminf_{\sigma \uparrow \tilde{\sigma}_{p}}(\tilde{\sigma}%
_{p}-\sigma )\int_{0}^{\tilde{\sigma}_{p}-\sigma }t^{p(\tilde{\sigma}%
_{p}-\sigma )/{\beta ^{\ast }}}\frac{dt}{t}\inf_{t\in (0,\tilde{\sigma}%
_{p}-\sigma )}\Psi _{u}^{\tilde{\sigma}_{p}}(t)  \notag \\
=& \frac{{\beta ^{\ast }}}{p}\liminf_{\sigma \uparrow \tilde{\sigma}_{p}}(%
\tilde{\sigma}_{p}-\sigma )^{p(\tilde{\sigma}_{p}-\sigma )/{\beta ^{\ast }}%
}\inf_{t\in (0,\tilde{\sigma}_{p}-\sigma )}\Psi _{u}^{\tilde{\sigma}_{p}}(t)
\notag \\
=& \frac{{\beta ^{\ast }}}{p}\liminf_{\sigma \uparrow \tilde{\sigma}%
_{p}}\inf_{t\in (0,\tilde{\sigma}_{p}-\sigma )}\Psi _{u}^{\tilde{\sigma}%
_{p}}(t)=\frac{{\beta ^{\ast }}}{p}\liminf_{t\rightarrow 0}\Psi _{u}^{\tilde{%
\sigma}_{p}}(t).  \notag
\end{align}%
It follows from property (KE) that
\begin{equation*}
\liminf_{\sigma \uparrow \tilde{\sigma}_{p}}(\tilde{\sigma}_{p}-\sigma ){E}%
_{p,p}^{\sigma }(u)\geq \frac{C{\beta ^{\ast }}}{p}E_{p,\infty }^{\tilde{%
\sigma}_{p}}(u).
\end{equation*}

For the right-hand side, let $A\in (0,R_{0})$ be a finite positive
number. By (\ref{304}), for any $\sigma \in (0,\tilde{\sigma _{p}})$,
\begin{eqnarray*}
{E}_{p,p}^{\sigma }(u) &=&\int_{0}^{R_{0}^{\beta ^{\ast }}}\frac{1}{t^{{%
p\sigma }/{\beta ^{\ast }}}}\left(
\int_{M}\int_{M}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}p_{t}(x,y)d\mu (x)d\mu (y)\right) \frac{dt}{t}
\\
&\leq &\int_{0}^{A^{\beta ^{\ast }}}\frac{1}{t^{{p\sigma }/{\beta ^{\ast }}}}%
\left( \int_{M}\int_{M}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}p_{t}(x,y)d\mu (x)d\mu (y)\right)
\frac{dt}{t}+\int_{A^{\beta ^{\ast }}}^{\infty }\frac{2^{p}\Vert u\Vert
_{p}^{p}}{t^{{p\sigma }/{\beta ^{\ast }}}}\frac{dt}{t} \\
&=&\int_{0}^{A^{\beta ^{\ast }}}t^{p(\tilde{\sigma}_{p}-\sigma )/{\beta
^{\ast }}}\Psi _{u}^{\tilde{\sigma}_{p}}(t)\frac{dt}{t}+\frac{2^{p}{\beta
^{\ast }}\Vert u\Vert _{p}^{p}}{p\sigma A^{{p\sigma }}}.
\end{eqnarray*}%
It follows that
\begin{align}
\limsup_{\sigma \uparrow \tilde{\sigma}_{p}}(\tilde{\sigma}_{p}-\sigma ){E}%
_{p,p}^{\sigma }(u)& \leq \limsup_{\sigma \uparrow \tilde{\sigma}_{p}}(%
\tilde{\sigma}_{p}-\sigma )\int_{0}^{A^{\beta ^{\ast }}}t^{p(\tilde{\sigma}%
_{p}-\sigma )/{\beta ^{\ast }}}\Psi _{u}^{\tilde{\sigma}_{p}}(t)\frac{dt}{t}%
+\limsup_{\sigma \uparrow \tilde{\sigma}_{p}}(\tilde{\sigma}_{p}-\sigma )%
\frac{2^{p}{\beta ^{\ast }}\Vert u\Vert _{p}^{p}}{p\sigma A^{{p\sigma }}}
\notag \\
& \leq \limsup_{\sigma \uparrow \tilde{\sigma}_{p}}(\tilde{\sigma}%
_{p}-\sigma )\int_{0}^{A^{\beta ^{\ast }}}t^{p(\tilde{\sigma}_{p}-\sigma )/{%
\beta ^{\ast }}}\frac{dt}{t}\sup_{t\in (0,A^{{\beta ^{\ast }}})}\Psi _{u}^{%
\tilde{\sigma}_{p}}(t)+0  \notag \\
& =\frac{{\beta ^{\ast }}}{p}\limsup_{\sigma \uparrow \tilde{\sigma}%
_{p}}A^{p(\tilde{\sigma}_{p}-\sigma )}\sup_{t\in (0,A^{{\beta ^{\ast }}%
})}\Psi _{u}^{\tilde{\sigma}_{p}}(t)  \notag \\
& =\frac{{\beta ^{\ast }}}{p}\sup_{t\in (0,A^{{\beta ^{\ast }}})}\Psi _{u}^{%
\tilde{\sigma}_{p}}(t)\leq \frac{{\beta ^{\ast }}}{p}E_{p,\infty }^{\tilde{%
\sigma}_{p}}(u).  \label{NE_right}
\end{align}%
The proof is complete.
\end{proof}

\subsection{BBM type characterization for Besov-Korevaar-Schoen
$p$-energy norms}

The proof of this version is similar to the previous one. {\color{blue}}
% {\color{red}Under a rather different assumption that the $(1, p)$-Poincar\'e inequality holds, G\'orny \cite{Gorny22.JGA} proved the convergence of the BBM difference quotient to the Cheeger energy. \textbf{[[put it here ?? This is not so good.-I also think this is bad.]]}}

\begin{proposition}
\label{Prop31}For any $\delta \in (0,\sigma )$, we have
\begin{equation}
 B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma }\subseteq B_{p,p}^{\sigma -\delta }.
\label{301}
\end{equation}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
By the elementary inequality $|a-b|^{p}\leq 2^{p-1}(|a|^{p}+|b|^{p})$, we
have
\begin{align}
& \int_{M}\frac{1}{V(x,r)}\int_{B(x,r)}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}d\mu (y)d\mu (x)
\notag \\
\leq & 2^{p-1}\int_{M}\frac{1}{V(x,r)}\int_{B(x,r)}(|u(x)|^{p}+|u(y)|^{p})d%
\mu (y)d\mu (x)  \notag \\
=& 2^{p-1}\left( \Vert u\Vert _{p}^{p}+\int_{M}\int_{M}\frac{\mathbf{1}%
_{\{d(y,x)<r\}}}{V(x,r)}|u(y)|^{p}d\mu (y)d\mu (x)\right)  \notag \\
=& 2^{p-1}\left( \Vert u\Vert _{p}^{p}+\int_{M}\left( \int_{B(y,r)}\frac{1}{%
V(x,r)}d\mu (x)\right) |u(y)|^{p}d\mu (y)\right)  \notag \\
\leq & 2^{p-1}\left( \Vert u\Vert _{p}^{p}+\sup_{x\in M}\frac{V(x,2r)}{V(x,r)%
}\int_{M}|u(y)|^{p}d\mu (y)\right) \leq C\Vert u\Vert _{p}^{p}.  \label{300}
\end{align}

Fix $\epsilon \in (0,R_{0})$. By \eqref{300},%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\lbrack u]_{B_{p,p}^{\sigma -\delta }}^{p} &=&\int_{0}^{R_{0}}r^{-(p\sigma
-p\delta )}\int_{M}\frac{1}{V(x,r)}\int_{B(x,r)}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}d\mu (y)d\mu
(x)\frac{dr}{r} \\
&\leq &\int_{0}^{\epsilon }r^{-(p\sigma -p\delta )}\int_{M}\frac{1}{V(x,r)}%
\int_{B(x,r)}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}d\mu (y)d\mu (x)\frac{dr}{r} \\
&&+\int_{\epsilon }^{\infty }r^{-(p\sigma -p\delta )}\int_{M}\frac{1}{V(x,r)}%
\int_{B(x,r)}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}d\mu (y)d\mu (x)\frac{dr}{r} \\
&\leq &\int_{0}^{\epsilon }r^{-1+p\delta }dr\sup_{r\in (0,R_{0})}\Phi
_{u}^{\sigma }(r)+C\Vert u\Vert _{p}^{p}\int_{\epsilon }^{\infty
}r^{-(p\sigma -p\delta )}\frac{dr}{r} \\
&=&\frac{\epsilon ^{p\delta }}{p\delta }\sup_{r\in (0,R_{0})}\Phi
_{u}^{\sigma }(r)+C\Vert u\Vert _{p}^{p}\frac{\epsilon ^{-p(\sigma -\delta )}%
}{p(\sigma -\delta )}=\frac{\epsilon ^{p\delta }}{p\delta }[u]_{B_{p,\infty
}^{\sigma }}^{p}+C^{\prime }\Vert u\Vert _{p}^{p}<\infty ,
\end{eqnarray*}%
thus showing \eqref{301}.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
\label{thm4.2} Suppose that $(M,d,\mu )$ satisfies property (NE), then there
exists a positive constant $C$ such that for all $u\in B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma
_{p}^{\#}}$,
\begin{equation}
C^{-1}[u]_{{B}_{p,\infty }^{\sigma _{p}^{\#}}}^{p}\leq \liminf_{\sigma
\uparrow \sigma _{p}^{\#}}(\sigma _{p}^{\#}-\sigma )[u]_{{B}_{p,p}^{\sigma
}}^{p}\leq \limsup_{\sigma \uparrow \sigma _{p}^{\#}}(\sigma
_{p}^{\#}-\sigma )[u]_{{B}_{p,p}^{\sigma }}^{p}\leq C[u]_{{B}_{p,\infty
}^{\sigma _{p}^{\#}}}^{p}.  \label{NE_conv}
\end{equation}%
Suppose that $(M,d,\mu )$ satisfies property $(\widetilde{NE})$ with $\sigma
_{p}>0$, then there exists a positive constant $C$ such that for all $u\in
B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma _{p}}$,
\begin{equation}
C^{-1}\Vert u\Vert _{{KS}_{p,\infty }^{\sigma _{p}}}^{p}\leq \liminf_{\sigma
\uparrow \sigma _{p}}(\sigma _{p}-\sigma )[u]_{{B}_{p,p}^{\sigma
}}^{p}\leq \limsup_{\sigma \uparrow \sigma _{p}}(\sigma _{p}-\sigma )[u]_{{B}%
_{p,p}^{\sigma }}^{p}\leq C\Vert u\Vert _{{KS}_{p,\infty }^{\sigma
_{p}}}^{p}.  \label{KS_conv}
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We show \eqref{NE_conv} first. For the left-hand side, similarly, we have
that for any $\sigma _{p}>0,$
\begin{align}
\liminf_{\sigma \uparrow \sigma _{p}}(\sigma _{p}-\sigma )[u]_{{B}%
_{p,p}^{\sigma }}^{p}=& \liminf_{\sigma \uparrow \sigma _{p}}(\sigma
_{p}-\sigma )\int_{0}^{R_{0}}r^{p(\sigma _{p}-\sigma )}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma
_{p}}(r)\frac{dr}{r}  \notag \\
\geq & \liminf_{\sigma \uparrow \sigma _{p}}(\sigma _{p}-\sigma
)\int_{0}^{\sigma _{p}-\sigma }r^{p(\sigma _{p}-\sigma )}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma
_{p}}(r)\frac{dr}{r}  \notag \\
\geq & \liminf_{\sigma \uparrow \sigma _{p}}(\sigma _{p}-\sigma
)\int_{0}^{\sigma _{p}-\sigma }r^{p(\sigma _{p}-\sigma )}\frac{dr}{r}%
\inf_{r\in (0,\sigma _{p}-\sigma )}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma _{p}}(r)  \notag \\
=& \frac{1}{p}\liminf_{\sigma \uparrow \sigma _{p}}\inf_{r\in (0,\sigma
_{p}-\sigma )}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma _{p}}(r)=\frac{1}{p}\liminf_{r\rightarrow
0}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma _{p}}(r).  \label{408}
\end{align}%
Therefore, by property (NE), we have for $\sigma _{p}=\sigma _{p}^{\#}$ that
\begin{equation}
\liminf_{\sigma \uparrow \sigma _{p}^{\#}}(\sigma _{p}^{\#}-\sigma )[u]_{{B}%
_{p,p}^{\sigma }}^{p}\geq \frac{C^{-1}}{p}[u]_{{B}_{p,\infty }^{\sigma
_{p}^{\#}}}^{p},  \label{NE_left}
\end{equation}%
where the constant $C$ is the same as in \eqref{NE1}.

For the other side, let $A\in (0,R_{0})$ be a finite positive number. We
have from \eqref{300} that
\begin{eqnarray}
\lbrack u]_{{B}_{p,p}^{\sigma }}^{p} &=&\int_{0}^{R_{0}}r^{-p\sigma }\left(
\int_{M}\frac{1}{V(x,r)}\int_{B(x,r)}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}d\mu (y)d\mu (x)\right)
\frac{dr}{r}  \notag \\
&\leq &\int_{0}^{A}r^{-p\sigma }\left( \int_{M}\frac{1}{V(x,r)}%
\int_{B(x,r)}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}d\mu (y)d\mu (x)\right) \frac{dr}{r}%
+C\int_{A}^{\infty }r^{-p\sigma }\Vert u\Vert _{p}^{p}\frac{dr}{r}  \notag \\
&=&\int_{0}^{A}r^{p(\sigma _{p}^{\#}-\sigma )}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma _{p}^{\#}}(r)%
\frac{dr}{r}+\frac{C\Vert u\Vert _{p}^{p}}{p\sigma A^{p\sigma }}.
\label{300-1}
\end{eqnarray}%
It follows that
\begin{align}
\limsup_{\sigma \uparrow \sigma _{p}^{\#}}(\sigma _{p}^{\#}-\sigma )[u]_{{B}%
_{p,p}^{\sigma }}^{p}& \leq \limsup_{\sigma \uparrow \sigma
_{p}^{\#}}(\sigma _{p}^{\#}-\sigma )\int_{0}^{A}r^{p(\sigma _{p}^{\#}-\sigma
)}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma _{p}^{\#}}(r)\frac{dr}{r}+\limsup_{\sigma \uparrow
\sigma _{p}^{\#}}(\sigma _{p}^{\#}-\sigma )\frac{C\Vert u\Vert _{p}^{p}}{%
p\sigma A^{p\sigma }}  \notag \\
& \leq \limsup_{\sigma \uparrow \sigma _{p}^{\#}}(\sigma _{p}^{\#}-\sigma
)\int_{0}^{A}r^{p(\sigma _{p}^{\#}-\sigma )}\frac{dr}{r}\sup_{r\in
(0,R_{0})}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma _{p}^{\#}}(r)+0  \notag \\
& =\frac{1}{p}\limsup_{\sigma \uparrow \sigma _{p}^{\#}}A^{p(\sigma
_{p}^{\#}-\sigma )}\sup_{r\in (0,R_{0})}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma _{p}^{\#}}(r)=%
\frac{1}{p}[u]_{B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma _{p}^{\#}}}^{p},  \label{42}
\end{align}%
thus showing \eqref{NE_conv}.

Next, we show \eqref{KS_conv}. By property $(\widetilde{NE})$ with $\sigma
_{p}$ and \eqref{408}, we have
\begin{equation}
\liminf_{\sigma \uparrow \sigma _{p}}(\sigma _{p}-\sigma )[u]_{{B}%
_{p,p}^{\sigma }}^{p}\geq C^{-1}\Vert u\Vert _{KS_{p,p}^{\sigma _{p}}}^{p}.
\label{KS_left}
\end{equation}%
Then for the other side of \eqref{KS_conv}, by the definition of $\limsup $,
there exists $\epsilon \in (0,R_{0})$ such that
\begin{equation*}
\sup_{r\in (0,\epsilon )}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma _{p}}(r)\leq
2\limsup_{r\rightarrow 0}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma _{p}}(r).
\end{equation*}%
It follows from replacing $\sigma _{p}^{\#}$ by $\sigma _{p}$
and taking $A=\epsilon $ in (\ref{300-1}) that,%
\begin{align}
\limsup_{\sigma \uparrow \sigma _{p}}(\sigma _{p}-\sigma )[u]_{{B}%
_{p,p}^{\sigma }}^{p}& \leq \limsup_{\sigma \uparrow \sigma _{p}}(\sigma
_{p}-\sigma )\int_{0}^{\epsilon }r^{p(\sigma _{p}-\sigma )}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma
_{p}}(r)\frac{dr}{r}+\limsup_{\sigma \uparrow \sigma _{p}}(\sigma
_{p}-\sigma )\frac{C\Vert u\Vert _{p}^{p}}{p\sigma \epsilon ^{p\sigma }}
\notag \\
& \leq \limsup_{\sigma \uparrow \sigma _{p}}(\sigma _{p}-\sigma
)\int_{0}^{\epsilon }r^{p(\sigma _{p}-\sigma )}\frac{dr}{r}\sup_{r\in
(0,\epsilon )}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma _{p}}(r)+0  \notag \\
& =\frac{1}{p}\sup_{r\in (0,\epsilon )}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma _{p}}(r)\leq \frac{2%
}{p}\limsup_{r\rightarrow 0}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma _{p}}(r)=\frac{2}{p}\Vert
u\Vert _{{KS}_{p,\infty }^{\sigma _{p}}}^{p}.  \label{KS_right}
\end{align}%
The proof is complete.
\end{proof}

\section{Equivalences on metric measure spaces}

\label{sec2} In this section, we assume that the metric
measure spaces admit a heat kernel satisfying (UHE) and (LHE).

%Once \eqref{hk} holds, we know that $\mu$ is $\alpha$-regular. For
%convenience, in this case, we as well rewrite (\ref{pi}) by
%\begin{equation*}
%\lbrack u]_{B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma }}^{p}:=\sup_{r\in
%(0,R_{0})}r^{-p\sigma-\alpha }\int_{M}\int_{B(x,r)}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}d\mu
%(y)d\mu (x),
%\end{equation*}
%and
%\begin{equation*}
%\lbrack u]_{B_{p,p}^{\sigma }}^{p}:=\int_{0}^{R_{0}}r^{-p\sigma-\alpha
%}\left( \int_{M}\int_{B(x,r)}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}d\mu (y)d\mu (x)\right) \frac{dr%
%}{r}
%\end{equation*}
%for (\ref{pp}).

\subsection{Equivalence of heat kernel-based and Besov norms}

 In this subsection, we fix $\sigma>0$. The main result of this subsection is the following.

\begin{lemma}
\label{thm1}If a metric measure space $(M,d,\mu )$ admits a heat kernel $%
\{p_{t}\}_{t>0}$ satisfying (UHE) and (LHE), then $\mathcal{D}(E_{p,\infty }^{\sigma })=B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma }$
and for all $u\in B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma }$,
\begin{equation}
E_{p,\infty }^{\sigma }(u)\asymp \lbrack u]_{B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma }}^{p}%
\text{\ and\ }\Vert u\Vert _{KS_{p,\infty }^{\sigma }}^{p}\asymp
\limsup_{t\rightarrow 0}\Psi _{u}^{\sigma }(t).  \label{eq1.7}
\end{equation}%
In addition, $\mathcal{D}(E_{p,p}^{\sigma })=B_{p,p}^{\sigma }$ and for all $%
u\in B_{p,p}^{\sigma }$,
\begin{equation}
E_{p,p}^{\sigma }(u)\asymp \lbrack u]_{B_{p,p}^{\sigma }}^{p}.  \label{eq1.8}
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}

We prove Lemma \ref{thm1} by pure elementary analysis (without
probability arguments) under slightly milder assumptions, and split the proof into Propositions %
\ref{lem3.1}-\ref{lem3.4}. Part of Lemma \ref{thm1} was also studied by
K.~Pietruska-Pa{\l }uba in \cite[Theorems 3.1 and 3.2]%
{Pietruska-Paluba.2010.} using probability arguments, and by Alonso Ruiz,
Baudoin et al. in \cite[Proposition 4.2]{AlonsoBaudoinchen2020CVPDE} which
considered the equivalence of heat semigroup-based Besov space {\textbf{B}}$%
^{p,\alpha/2}$ and Besov space $B_{p,\infty }^{\alpha }$ under the Gaussian
heat kernel estimate. Very recently, Cao and Qiu in \cite{Caoqiu23} prove
the equivalence of the Korevaar-Schoen norm and another type of Besov norm.

\begin{proposition}
\label{lem3.1} If $(M,d,\mu )$ admits a heat kernel $\{p_{t}\}_{t>0}$
satisfying (LHE), then there exists a positive constant $C$
such that for all $u\in \mathcal{D}(E_{p,p}^{\sigma })$,
\begin{equation}
\lbrack u]_{B_{p,p}^{\sigma }}^{p}\leq CE_{p,p}^{\sigma }(u).  \label{eq3.1}
\end{equation}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
By (LHE), we have from \eqref{VD2} that
\begin{align}
& \frac{1}{t^{{p\sigma }/{\beta ^{\ast }}}}\int_{M}\int_{B(x, t^{{1}/{\beta
^{\ast }}})}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}p_{t}(x,y)d\mu (y)d\mu (x)  \notag \\
\geq& \frac{c_{1}}{t^{p\sigma /\beta ^{\ast }}}\int_{M}\frac{1}{%
V(x,t^{1/\beta ^{\ast }})}\int_{B(x, t^{{1}/{\beta ^{\ast }}%
})}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p} \exp \left(-c_2\left(\frac{d(x,y)}{t^{1/\beta^*}}\right)^{%
\frac{\beta^*}{\beta^*-1}}\right)d\mu (y)d\mu (x)  \notag \\
\geq & c_{1}e^{-c_2} \Phi_u^{\sigma}( t^{1/\beta^*}) .  \label{eq3-2}
\end{align}
Therefore,
\begin{align*}
E_{p,p}^{\sigma }(u)&=\int_{0}^{R_{0}^{\beta ^{\ast }}}\frac{1}{t^{{p\sigma }%
/{\beta ^{\ast }}}}\left( \int_{M}\int_{M}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}p_{t}(x,y)d\mu
(x)d\mu (y)\right) \frac{dt}{t} \\
& \geq \beta ^{\ast }c_{1}e^{-c_2}\int_{0}^{R_{0}} \Phi_u^{\sigma}(r)\frac{dr%
}{r} =\beta ^{\ast}c_{1}e^{-c_2}\lbrack u]_{B_{p,p}^{\sigma }}^{p},
\end{align*}
which completes the proof.
\end{proof}

%Now we prove the opposite inequality of \eqref{eq3.1}.

\begin{proposition}
\label{lem3.2} If $(M,d,\mu )$ admits a heat kernel $\{p_{t}\}_{t>0}$
satisfying (UHE), then there exists a positive constant $C$
such that for all $u\in B_{p,p}^{\sigma }$,
\begin{equation*}
E_{p,p}^{\sigma }(u)\leq C[u]_{B_{p,p}^{\sigma }}^{p}.
\end{equation*}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
We split $M$ into union of rings $B(x,2^{n}t^{1/\beta ^{\ast }})\setminus
B(x,2^{n-1}t^{1/\beta ^{\ast }})$ for $x\in M$, where the integers $n\leq \log
_{2}(R_{0}t^{-1/\beta ^{\ast }})$, then by (\ref{UHE}),
\begin{align}
& \Psi_u^{\sigma}(t)=\frac{1}{t^{{p\sigma }/{\beta ^{\ast }}}}%
\int_{M}\int_{M}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}p_{t}(x,y)d\mu (y)d\mu (x)  \notag \\
& =\frac{1}{t^{{p\sigma }/{\beta ^{\ast }}}}\int_{M}\sum_{n\leq \log
_{2}(R_{0}t^{-1/\beta ^{\ast }})}\int_{B(x,2^{n}t^{1/\beta ^{\ast
}})\setminus B(x,2^{n-1}t^{1/\beta ^{\ast }})}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}p_{t}(x,y)d\mu
(y)d\mu (x)  \notag \\
&\leq \frac{1}{t^{{p\sigma }/{\beta ^{\ast }}}}\int_{M}\frac{c_{3}}{%
V(x,t^{1/\beta ^{\ast }})}\sum_{n\leq \log _{2}(R_{0}t^{-1/\beta ^{\ast
}})}\int_{B(x,2^{n}t^{1/\beta ^{\ast }})\setminus B(x,2^{n-1}t^{1/\beta
^{\ast }})}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}\exp \left( -c_{4}2^{\frac{(n-1)\beta ^{\ast }}{%
\beta ^{\ast }-1}}\right) d\mu (y)d\mu (x)  \notag \\
&\leq \sum_{n\leq \log _{2}(R_{0}t^{-1/\beta ^{\ast }})}\frac{1}{t^{{p\sigma
}/{\beta ^{\ast }}}}\int_{M}\frac{c_{3}}{V(x,t^{1/\beta ^{\ast }})}%
\int_{B(x,2^{n}t^{1/\beta ^{\ast }})}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}\exp \left( -c_{4}2^{%
\frac{(n-1)\beta ^{\ast }}{\beta ^{\ast }-1}}\right) d\mu (y)d\mu (x)  \notag
\\
&\leq \sum_{n\leq \log _{2}(R_{0}t^{-1/\beta ^{\ast }})}\exp \left( -c_{4}2^{%
\frac{(n-1)\beta ^{\ast }}{\beta ^{\ast }-1}}\right)\frac{2^{n p\sigma}}{%
(2^{n}t^{1/\beta ^{\ast }})^{p\sigma}} \int_{M}\frac{c_{3}C_{d}2^{n\alpha
_{1}}}{V(x,2^{n}t^{1/\beta ^{\ast }})}\int_{B(x,2^{n}t^{1/\beta ^{\ast
}})}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}d\mu (y)d\mu (x)  \notag \\
&=c_{3}C_{d}\sum_{n=-\infty }^{\infty }1_{\{n\leq \log _{2}(R_{0}t^{-1/\beta
^{\ast }})\}}\exp \left( -c_{4}2^{\frac{(n-1)\beta ^{\ast }}{\beta ^{\ast }-1%
}}\right)2^{(p\sigma +\alpha _{1})n}\Phi_u^{\sigma}(2^{n}t^{1/\beta ^{\ast
}}) ,  \label{eq3.3}
\end{align}
where we use the volume doubling property \eqref{VD2} in the fifth
line
\begin{equation}
\frac{V(x,2^{n}t^{1/\beta ^{\ast }})}{V(x,t^{1/\beta ^{\ast }})}\leq
C_{d}2^{n\alpha _{1}}.  \label{VD}
\end{equation}

Therefore,%
\begin{align*}
& E_{p,p}^{\sigma }(u)=\int_{0}^{R_{0}^{\beta ^{\ast }}}\frac{1}{t^{{p\sigma
}/{\beta ^{\ast }}}}\left( \int_{M}\int_{M}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}p_{t}(x,y)d\mu
(x)d\mu (y)\right) \frac{dt}{t} \\
& \leq c_{3}C_{d}\sum_{n=-\infty }^{\infty }\exp \left( -c_{4}2^{\frac{%
(n-1)\beta ^{\ast }}{\beta ^{\ast }-1}}\right) \int_{0}^{2^{-n\beta ^{\ast
}}R_{0}^{\beta ^{\ast }}}2^{(p\sigma +\alpha
_{1})n}\Phi_u^{\sigma}(2^{n}t^{1/\beta ^{\ast }}) \frac{dt}{t} \\
& =c_{3}C_{d}\beta ^{\ast }\sum_{n=-\infty }^{\infty }\exp \left( -c_{4}2^{%
\frac{(n-1)\beta ^{\ast }}{\beta ^{\ast }-1}}\right) 2^{(p\sigma +\alpha
_{1})n}\int_{0}^{R_{0}}\Phi_u^{\sigma}(r) \frac{dr}{r} =c_{3}C_{d}\beta
^{\ast }C_{0}[u]_{B_{p,p}^{\sigma }}^{p},
\end{align*}
where
\begin{eqnarray}
C_{0} &=&\sum_{n=-\infty }^{\infty }\exp \left( -c_{4}2^{\frac{(n-1)\beta
^{\ast }}{\beta ^{\ast }-1}}\right) 2^{(p\sigma +\alpha _{1})n}  \notag \\
&\leq &\sum_{n=-\infty }^{0}2^{(p\sigma +\alpha _{1})n}+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty
}\exp \left( -c_{4}2^{\frac{(n-1)\beta ^{\ast }}{\beta ^{\ast }-1}}\right)
2^{(p\sigma +\alpha _{1})n}<\infty ,  \label{c1}
\end{eqnarray}%
which completes the proof.
\end{proof}

%Next, we prove the second inclusion in Lemma \ref{thm1} by deriving the upper bound estimate of $[u]_{B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma }}^{p}$ in Lemma \ref%{lem3.3} and the lower bound estimate of $[u]_{B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma }}^{p}$in Lemma \ref{lem3.4}.
The following two propositions are easier to obtain.

\begin{proposition}
\label{lem3.3} If $(M,d,\mu )$ admits a heat kernel $\{p_{t}\}_{t>0}$
satisfying (LHE), then there exists a positive constant $C$
such that for all $u\in \mathcal{D}(E_{p,\infty }^{\sigma })$,
\begin{equation*}
\lbrack u]_{B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma }}^{p}\leq CE_{p,\infty }^{\sigma }(u).
\end{equation*}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
{By \eqref{eq3-2}, we have
\begin{align*}
& E_{p,\infty }^{\sigma }(u)=\sup_{t\in (0,R_{0}^{\beta ^{\ast }})}\frac{1}{%
t^{{p\sigma }/{\beta ^{\ast }}}} \int_{M}\int_{M}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}p_{t}(x,y)d%
\mu (x)d\mu (y) \\
&\geq c_{1}e^{-c_2}\sup_{t\in (0,R_{0}^{\beta ^{\ast }})}\Phi_u^{\sigma}(
t^{1/\beta^*}) =c_{1}e^{c_2}\sup_{r\in (0,R_{0})}\Phi_u^{\sigma}(r)
=c_{1}e^{c_2}[u]_{B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma }}^{p},
\end{align*}%
}which ends the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
\label{lem3.4} If $(M,d,\mu )$ admits a heat kernel $\{p_{t}\}_{t>0}$
satisfying (UHE), then there exists a positive constant $C$
such that for all $u\in B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma }$,
\begin{equation*}
E_{p,\infty }^{\sigma }(u)\leq C[u]_{B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma }}^{p}.
\end{equation*}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
By \eqref{eq3.3} and \eqref{VD}, we have
\begin{align}
& \Psi_u^{\sigma}(t) \leq c_{3}C_{d}\sum_{n=-\infty }^{\infty }1_{\{n\leq
\log _{2}(R_{0}t^{-1/\beta ^{\ast }})\}}\exp \left( -c_{4}2^{\frac{%
(n-1)\beta ^{\ast }}{\beta ^{\ast }-1}}\right)2^{(p\sigma +\alpha
_{1})n}\Phi_u^{\sigma}(2^{n}t^{1/\beta ^{\ast }})  \notag \\
=& c_{3}C_{d}\sum_{n=-\infty }^{\infty }\exp \left( -c_{4}2^{\frac{%
(n-1)\beta ^{\ast }}{\beta ^{\ast }-1}}\right) 2^{(p\sigma +\alpha
_{1})n}[u]_{B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma }}^{p}=c_{3}C_{d}C_{0}[u]_{B_{p,\infty
}^{\sigma }}^{p},  \label{eq3.14}
\end{align}%
where $C_{0}$ is finite by \eqref{c1}.

%\begin{proof}
%By \eqref{eq3.3} and \eqref{VD}, we have
%\begin{align}
%& E_{p,\infty }^{\sigma }(u) \frac{1}{t^{p\sigma /\beta ^{\ast }}}\int_{M}%
%\int_{M}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}p_{t}(x,y)d\mu (y)d\mu (x)  \notag \\
%\leq & c_{3}C_{d}\sum_{n=-\infty }^{\infty }\frac{1_{\{n\leq \log
%_{2}(R_{0}t^{-1/\beta ^{\ast }})\}}}{t^{p\sigma /\beta ^{\ast }}}\exp \left(
%-c_{4}2^{\frac{(n-1)\beta ^{\ast }}{\beta ^{\ast }-1}}\right) 2^{n\alpha
%_{1}}\left( \int_{M}\frac{1}{V(x,2^{n}t^{1/\beta ^{\ast }})}%
%\int_{B(x,2^{n}t^{1/\beta ^{\ast }})}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}d\mu (y)d\mu (x)\right)
%\label{eq3.14-1} \\
%\leq & c_{3}C_{d}\sum_{n=-\infty }^{\infty }\exp \left( -c_{4}2^{\frac{%
%(n-1)\beta ^{\ast }}{\beta ^{\ast }-1}}\right) 2^{(p\sigma +\alpha
%_{1})n}\sup_{r\in (0,R_{0})}\frac{1}{r^{p\sigma }}\int_{M}\frac{1}{V(x,r)}%
%\int_{B(x,r)}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}d\mu (y)d\mu (x)  \notag \\
%=& c_{3}C_{d}\sum_{n=-\infty }^{\infty }\exp \left( -c_{4}2^{\frac{%
%(n-1)\beta ^{\ast }}{\beta ^{\ast }-1}}\right) 2^{(p\sigma +\alpha
%_{1})n}[u]_{B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma }}^{p}=c_{3}C_{d}C_{0}[u]_{B_{p,\infty
%}^{\sigma }}^{p},  \label{eq3.14}
%\end{align}%
%where $C_{0}$ is finite by \eqref{c1}.

Finally, taking the supremum in $(0,R_{0}^{\beta ^{\ast }})$ on both sides
of \eqref{eq3.14}, we complete the proof.
\end{proof}

If $(M,d,\mu )$ admits a heat kernel $\{p_{t}\}_{t>0}$ satisfying %
(UHE) and (LHE), by Propositions \ref{lem3.1} and \ref%
{lem3.2}, we know that $\mathcal{D}(E_{p,p}^{\sigma })=B_{p,p}^{\sigma }$
and (\ref{eq1.8}) holds. We obtain $\mathcal{D}(E_{p,\infty }^{\sigma
})=B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma }$ and $E_{p,\infty }^{\sigma }(u)\asymp \lbrack
u]_{B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma }}^{p}$ from Propositions \ref{lem3.3} and \ref%
{lem3.4}. It remains to show $\Vert u\Vert _{KS_{p,\infty }^{\sigma
}}^{p}\asymp \limsup_{t\rightarrow 0}\Psi _{u}^{\sigma }(t)$ in (\ref{eq1.7}%
) for all $u\in B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma }$ when two-sided estimates %
(UHE) and (LHE) hold.

\begin{proposition}
\label{corol3.5} If $(M,d,\mu )$ admits a heat kernel $\{p_{t}\}_{t>0}$
satisfying (UHE) and (LHE), then for all $u\in B_{p,\infty
}^{\sigma }$,
\begin{equation}
\limsup_{t\rightarrow 0}\Psi _{u}^{\sigma }(t)\asymp \limsup_{r\rightarrow
0}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma }(r).  \label{limsup_psiphi}
\end{equation}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
By Proposition \ref{lem3.3}, we have%
\begin{equation}
\sup_{r\in (0,R_{0})}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma }(r)\leq C\sup_{t\in (0,R_{0}^{\beta
^{\ast }})}\Psi _{u}^{\sigma }(t),  \label{31}
\end{equation}%
for any $R_{0}\in (0,$\textrm{diam}$(M)]$. Therefore, if we pick $%
R_{0}=\epsilon $ in \eqref{31}, then
\begin{align*}
\limsup_{t\rightarrow 0}\Psi _{u}^{\sigma }(t)& =\lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow
0}\sup_{t\in (0,\epsilon )}\Psi _{u}^{\sigma }(t) \\
& \geq C_{1}\lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0}\sup_{r\in (0,\epsilon ^{1/\beta
^{\ast }})}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma }(r)=C_{1}\limsup_{r\rightarrow 0}\Phi
_{u}^{\sigma }(r).
\end{align*}

Next, we consider the other side of \eqref{limsup_psiphi}.
We have by \eqref{eq3.3} and the dominated convergence theorem
\begin{align*}
& \limsup_{t\rightarrow 0}\frac{1}{t^{p\sigma /\beta ^{\ast }}}%
\int_{M}\int_{M}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}p_{t}(x,y)d\mu (y)d\mu (x) \\
\leq & C_{1}\sum_{n=-\infty }^{\infty }\exp \left( -c_{4}2^{\frac{(n-1)\beta
^{\ast }}{\beta ^{\ast }-1}}\right) \limsup_{t\rightarrow 0}\frac{1_{\{n\leq
\log _{2}(R_{0}t^{-1/\beta ^{\ast }})\}}}{(2^{n}t^{1/\beta ^{\ast
}})^{p\sigma }}\int_{M}\frac{2^{(p\sigma +\alpha _{1})n}}{%
V(x,2^{n}t^{1/\beta ^{\ast }})}\int_{B(x,2^{n}t^{1/\beta ^{\ast
}})}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}d\mu (y)d\mu (x) \\
\leq & C_{1}\sum_{n=-\infty }^{\infty }\exp \left( -c_{4}2^{\frac{(n-1)\beta
^{\ast }}{\beta ^{\ast }-1}}\right) 2^{(p\sigma +\alpha
_{1})n}\limsup_{r\rightarrow 0}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma }(r)\leq
C_{1}C_{0}\limsup_{r\rightarrow 0}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma }(r),
\end{align*}%
where $C_{1}=c_{3}C_{d}$ and the constant $C_{0}$ is defined in \eqref{c1},
which ends the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Lemma \protect\ref{thm1}]
By Propositions \ref{lem3.1} and \ref{lem3.2}, we obtain \eqref{eq1.8}. By
Propositions \ref{lem3.3}-\ref{corol3.5}, we obtain \eqref{eq1.7}.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Equivalence of properties (KE) and (NE)}

We start by an easy side $(NE)\Rightarrow (KE)$ which holds automatically.

\begin{proposition}
\label{thm_2} Suppose that $(M,d,\mu )$ admits a heat kernel $%
\{p_{t}\}_{t>0} $ satisfying (LHE). Then there exists $C>0$
such that for all $u\in \mathcal{D}(E_{p,\infty }^{\sigma })$,
\begin{equation*}
\Psi _{u}^{\sigma }(t)\geq C\Phi _{u}^{\sigma }(t^{1/\beta ^{\ast }}).
\end{equation*}%
Consequently,
\begin{equation}
\liminf_{t\rightarrow 0}\Psi _{u}^{\sigma }(t)\geq C\liminf_{r\rightarrow
0}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma }(r),  \label{limpsi}
\end{equation}
where the constant $C$ depends only on $c_{1}$ in (LHE).
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
By \eqref{eq3-2}, we have
\begin{align*}
\Psi _{u}^{\sigma }(t)& \geq \frac{1}{t^{p\sigma /\beta ^{\ast }}}%
\int_{M}\int_{B(x,\delta t^{1/\beta ^{\ast }})}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}p_{t}(x,y)d\mu
(y)d\mu (x) \\
& \geq \frac{c_{1}C_{d}^{-1}\delta ^{\alpha _{1}}}{t^{p\sigma /\beta ^{\ast
}}}\int_{M}\frac{1}{V(x,\delta t^{1/\beta ^{\ast }})}\int_{B(x,\delta t^{{1}/%
{\beta ^{\ast }}})}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}d\mu (y)d\mu (x) \\
& =c_{1}C_{d}^{-1}\delta ^{p\sigma +\alpha _{1}}\Phi _{u}(\delta t^{1/\beta
^{\ast }}).
\end{align*}%
Taking the lower limit on both sides of the above inequality, we have
\begin{equation*}
\liminf_{t\rightarrow 0}\Psi _{u}^{\sigma }(t)\geq c_{1}C_{d}^{-1}\delta
^{p\sigma +\alpha _{1}}\liminf_{t\rightarrow 0}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma
}(t^{1/\beta ^{\ast }})=c_{1}C_{d}^{-1}\delta ^{p\sigma +\alpha
_{1}}\liminf_{r\rightarrow 0}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma }(r),
\end{equation*}%
which implies \eqref{limpsi}.
\end{proof}

We need to use the following proposition adapted from the proof of \cite[%
Lemma 4.13]{AlonsoBaudoinchen2021CVPDE} (without proof) and we present its
proof here for later use.

\begin{proposition}
\label{hk_ct} Suppose that $M$ admits a heat kernel satisfying %
(UHE) and (LHE), then there exist $C,c>1$ and $c^{\prime
}>0 $ such that for any $\delta >0$ and for $\mu$-almost all $x,y\in M$ with
$d(x,y)>\delta t^{1/\beta ^{\ast }}$,
\begin{equation*}
p_{t}(x,y)\leq C\exp \left( -c^{\prime }\delta ^{\frac{\beta ^{\ast }}{\beta
^{\ast }-1}}\right) p_{ct}(x,y).
\end{equation*}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
By (UHE) and volume doubling property \eqref{VD2}, we have
\begin{align*}
p_{t}(x,y)& \leq \frac{c_{3}}{V(x,t^{1/\beta ^{\ast }})}\exp \left(
-c_{4}\left( \frac{d(x,y)}{t^{1/\beta ^{\ast }}}\right) ^{\frac{\beta ^{\ast
}}{\beta ^{\ast }-1}}\right) \\
& \leq \frac{c_{3}C_{d}c^{\alpha _{1}/\beta ^{\ast }}}{V(x,(ct)^{1/\beta
^{\ast }})}\exp \left( -c_{4}\left( \frac{d(x,y)}{(ct)^{1/\beta ^{\ast }}}%
\right) ^{\frac{\beta ^{\ast }}{\beta ^{\ast }-1}}\cdot c^{\frac{1}{\beta
^{\ast }-1}}\right) \\
& =\frac{c_{3}C_{d}c^{\alpha _{1}/\beta ^{\ast }}}{c_{1}}\frac{c_{1}}{%
V(x,(ct)^{1/\beta ^{\ast }})}\exp \left( -c_{4}\left( \frac{d(x,y)}{%
(ct)^{1/\beta ^{\ast }}}\right) ^{\frac{\beta ^{\ast }}{\beta ^{\ast }-1}%
}\cdot c^{\frac{1}{\beta ^{\ast }-1}}\right) ,
\end{align*}%
for $\mu $-almost all $x,y\in M$. Taking $\tilde{c}=c_{4}c^{\frac{1}{\beta
^{\ast }-1}}-c_{2}$, then we use (LHE) to obtain
\begin{equation*}
p_{t}(x,y)\leq \frac{c_{3}C_{d}c^{\alpha _{1}/\beta ^{\ast }}}{c_{1}}\exp
\left( -\tilde{c}\left( \frac{d(x,y)}{(ct)^{1/\beta ^{\ast }}}\right) ^{%
\frac{\beta ^{\ast }}{\beta ^{\ast }-1}}\right) p_{ct}(x,y).
\end{equation*}%
We choose $c>1$ to ensure $c^{\frac{1}{\beta ^{\ast }-1}}c_{4}>c_{2}$ so
that $\tilde{c}>0$. Let $c^{\prime }={\tilde{c}}/{c^{\frac{1}{\beta ^{\ast
}-1}}}$, then for $d(x,y)>\delta t^{1/\beta ^{\ast }}$,
\begin{equation*}
p_{t}(x,y)\leq \frac{c_{3}C_{d}c^{\alpha _{1}/\beta ^{\ast }}}{c_{1}}\exp
\left( -c^{\prime }\left( \frac{d(x,y)}{t^{1/\beta ^{\ast }}}\right) ^{\frac{%
\beta ^{\ast }}{\beta ^{\ast }-1}}\right) p_{ct}(x,y)\leq C\exp \left(
-c^{\prime }\delta ^{\frac{\beta ^{\ast }}{\beta ^{\ast }-1}}\right)
p_{ct}(x,y),
\end{equation*}%
where $C=\frac{c_{3}C_{d}c^{\alpha _{1}/\beta ^{\ast }}}{c_{1}}$. The proof
is complete.
\end{proof}

The proof for the other side $(KE)\Rightarrow (NE)$ is inspired by \cite[%
Lemma 4.13]{AlonsoBaudoinchen2021CVPDE} where $p=1$ therein.

\begin{lemma}
\label{thm_1} Suppose that $(M,d,\mu )$ admits a heat kernel $%
\{p_{t}\}_{t>0} $ satisfying (UHE) and (LHE). Under the
property $(\widetilde{KE}) $ with $\sigma >0$, we have
\begin{equation}
\liminf_{t\rightarrow 0}\Psi _{u}^{\sigma }(t)\leq C\liminf_{r\rightarrow
0}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma }(r),  \label{limphiu}
\end{equation}
for all $u\in \mathcal{D}(E_{p,\infty }^{\sigma })$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Temporally fix $u\in \mathcal{D}(E_{p,\infty }^{\sigma })$. Without loss of
generality, assume that $\liminf_{t\rightarrow 0}\Psi _{u}^{\sigma }(t)>0$.
Fix $\delta >1$ to be determined by (\ref{dd}). For $t\in (0,R_{0}^{\beta
^{\ast }})$, decompose
\begin{equation*}
\Psi _{u}^{\sigma }(t)=\Psi _{1}(t)+\Psi _{2}(t),
\end{equation*}%
where
\begin{align*}
\Psi _{1}(t)& =\frac{1}{t^{{p\sigma }/{\beta ^{\ast }}}}\iint_{\{d(x,y)\leq
\delta t^{1/\beta ^{\ast }}\}}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}p_{t}(x,y)d\mu (y)d\mu (x), \\
\Psi _{2}(t)& =\frac{1}{t^{{p\sigma }/{\beta ^{\ast }}}}\iint_{\{d(x,y)>%
\delta t^{1/\beta ^{\ast }}\}}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}p_{t}(x,y)d\mu (y)d\mu (x).
\end{align*}

For $\Psi _{1}(t)$, when $d(x,y)\leq \delta t^{1/\beta ^{\ast }}$, we have
\begin{align*}
\frac{c_{1}}{V(x,t^{1/\beta ^{\ast }})}\exp \left( -c_{2}\delta ^{\frac{%
\beta ^{\ast }}{\beta ^{\ast }-1}}\right) \leq & \frac{c_{1}}{V(x,t^{1/\beta
^{\ast }})}\exp \left( -c_{2}\left( \frac{d(x,y)}{t^{1/\beta ^{\ast }}}%
\right) ^{\frac{\beta ^{\ast }}{\beta ^{\ast }-1}}\right) \\
\leq & p_{t}(x,y)\leq \frac{c_{3}}{V(x,t^{1/\beta ^{\ast }})}\exp \left(
-c_{4}\left( \frac{d(x,y)}{t^{1/\beta ^{\ast }}}\right) ^{\frac{\beta ^{\ast
}}{\beta ^{\ast }-1}}\right) \leq \frac{c_{5}}{V(x,t^{1/\beta ^{\ast }})}.
\end{align*}%
Therefore, noting that $\delta>1$, we have from \eqref{VD2} that
\begin{align}
\Psi _{1}(t)& \leq \frac{c_{3}}{t^{p\sigma /\beta ^{\ast }}}%
\iint_{\{d(x,y)\leq \delta t^{1/\beta ^{\ast }}\}}\frac{|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}}{%
V(x,t^{1/\beta ^{\ast }})}d\mu (y)d\mu (x)  \notag \\
& \leq \frac{c_{3}C_{d}\delta ^{\alpha _{1}}}{t^{p\sigma /\beta ^{\ast }}}%
\iint_{\{d(x,y)\leq \delta t^{1/\beta ^{\ast }}\}}\frac{|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}}{%
V(x,\delta t^{1/\beta ^{\ast }})}d\mu (y)d\mu (x)=C_{1}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma
}(\delta t^{1/\beta ^{\ast }}),  \label{psi1}
\end{align}%
where $C_{1}=c_{3}C_{d}\delta ^{p\sigma +\alpha _{1}}$.

For $\Psi _{2}(t)$, by Proposition \ref{hk_ct}, we have
\begin{equation}
\Psi _{2}(t)\leq A\Psi _{u}^{\sigma }(ct),  \label{psi2}
\end{equation}%
where $A=Cc^{p\sigma /\beta ^{\ast }}\exp \left( -c^{\prime }\delta ^{\frac{%
\beta ^{\ast }}{\beta ^{\ast }-1}}\right) $ can be made as small as we
desire by making $\delta $ large enough since $C,c,c^{\prime }$ are
independent constants. So from now on we choose $\delta $ large enough such
that
\begin{equation}
A=Cc^{p\sigma /\beta ^{\ast }}\exp \left( -c^{\prime }\delta ^{\frac{\beta
^{\ast }}{\beta ^{\ast }-1}}\right) <\frac{1}{2}.  \label{dd}
\end{equation}
Combining \eqref{psi1} and \eqref{psi2}, we have%
\begin{equation}
\Psi _{u}^{\sigma }(t)\leq C_{1}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma }(\delta t^{1/\beta ^{\ast
}})+A\Psi _{u}^{\sigma }(ct).  \label{41}
\end{equation}

%Let $t=c^{-(n+1)}$, then
%\begin{equation*}
%\Psi _{u}^{\sigma }(c^{-(n+1)})\leq C_{1}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma }(\delta
%c^{-(n+1)/\beta ^{\ast }})+A\Psi _{u}^{\sigma }(c^{-n}).
%\end{equation*}%
%Since $\limsup_{r\rightarrow 0}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma }(r)<\infty $ by
%Proposition \ref{corol3.5} and property $(\widetilde{KE})$, there exists $%
%M_{0}$ such that
%\begin{equation*}
%\sup_{n\geq 1}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma }(\delta c^{-n/\beta ^{\ast }})\leq
%M_{0}<\infty .
%\end{equation*}%
%Picking up $M_{1}=\max \{C_{1}M_{0},\Psi _{u}^{\sigma }(c^{-1})\}$, we have $%
%\Psi _{u}^{\sigma }(c^{-2})\leq (1+A)M_{1}$.
%
%By induction, we have
%\begin{equation*}
%\Psi _{u}^{\sigma }(c^{-n})\leq M_{1}\left( \frac{1-A^{n}}{1-A}\right) .
%\end{equation*}%
%Letting $n\rightarrow \infty $, we obtain
%\begin{equation*}
%\liminf_{t\rightarrow 0}\Psi _{u}^{\sigma }(t)<\infty .
%\end{equation*}

By property $(\widetilde{KE})$, there exists $t_{0}>0$ such that for all $%
t\in (0,t_{0})$,
\begin{equation*}
\Psi _{u}^{\sigma }(t)\leq \sup_{0<t<t_{0}}\Psi _{u}^{\sigma }(t)\leq
2\limsup_{t\rightarrow 0}\Psi _{u}^{\sigma }(t)\leq
C_{2}\liminf_{t\rightarrow 0}\Psi _{u}^{\sigma }(t),
\end{equation*}%
where $C_{2}$ comes from property $(\widetilde{KE})$. Therefore, we have
from \eqref{41} that, for all small enough $t\in (0,\frac{t_{0}}{c})$,
\begin{equation*}
\Psi _{u}^{\sigma }(t)\leq C_{1}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma }(\delta t^{1/\beta ^{\ast
}})+AC_{2}\liminf_{t\rightarrow 0}\Psi _{u}^{\sigma }(t).
\end{equation*}%
Fixing $\delta $ such that $AC_{2}<1$ with aforementioned requirement $A<%
\frac{1}{2}$, it follows that
\begin{equation*}
\liminf_{t\rightarrow 0}\Psi _{u}^{\sigma }(t)\leq
C_{1}\liminf_{t\rightarrow 0}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma
}(t)+AC_{2}\liminf_{t\rightarrow 0}\Psi _{u}^{\sigma }(t),
\end{equation*}%
which implies
\begin{equation*}
\liminf_{t\rightarrow 0}\Psi _{u}^{\sigma }(t)\leq
C_{3}\liminf_{t\rightarrow 0}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma }(t),
\end{equation*}%
where $C_{3}=\frac{C_{1}}{1-AC_{2}}$. The proof is complete.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \protect\ref{thm4}]
Since two-sided estimates (UHE) and (LHE) hold, using Lemma %
\ref{thm1}, we have that $\mathcal{D}(E_{p,\infty }^{\sigma })=B_{p,\infty
}^{\sigma }$ for any $\sigma >0$.

By \eqref{limsup_psiphi} and \eqref{limphiu}, $(\widetilde{KE})$ implies $(%
\widetilde{NE})$ since for all $u\in B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma }=\mathcal{D}%
(E_{p,\infty }^{\sigma })$,
\begin{equation}
\limsup_{r\rightarrow 0}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma }(r)\leq C\limsup_{t\rightarrow
0}\Psi _{u}^{\sigma }(t)\leq C^{\prime }\liminf_{t\rightarrow 0}\Psi
_{u}^{\sigma }(t)\leq C^{\prime \prime }\liminf_{r\rightarrow 0}\Phi
_{u}^{\sigma }(r).  \label{ke_ne1}
\end{equation}

By \eqref{limsup_psiphi} and \eqref{limpsi}, $(\widetilde{NE})$ implies $(%
\widetilde{KE})$ since
\begin{equation}
\limsup_{t\rightarrow 0}\Psi _{u}^{\sigma }(t)\leq
C_{1}\limsup_{r\rightarrow 0}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma }(r)\leq C_{1}^{\prime
}\liminf_{r\rightarrow 0}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma }(r)\leq C_{1}^{\prime \prime
}\liminf_{t\rightarrow 0}\Psi _{u}^{\sigma }(t).  \label{ne_ke1}
\end{equation}%
Therefore, by \eqref{ke_ne1} and \eqref{ne_ke1}, we show Theorem \ref{thm4}
(i).

By \eqref{limphiu} and Proposition \ref{lem3.3}, (KE) implies (NE) since
\begin{equation}
\sup_{r\in (0,R_{0})}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma }(r)\leq C_{2}\sup_{t\in
(0,R_{0}^{\beta ^{\ast }})}\Psi _{u}^{\sigma }(t)\leq C_{2}^{\prime
}\liminf_{t\rightarrow 0}\Psi _{u}^{\sigma }(t)\leq C_{2}^{\prime \prime
}\liminf_{r\rightarrow 0}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma }(r),  \label{ke_ne2}
\end{equation}%
where we use the simple fact (KE)$\Rightarrow (\widetilde{KE})$. Similarly,
by \eqref{limpsi} and Proposition \ref{lem3.4} adjoint with the fact (NE)$%
\Rightarrow (\widetilde{NE})$, we immediately derive (KE) since
\begin{equation}
\sup_{t\in (0,R_{0}^{\beta ^{\ast }})}\Psi _{u}^{\sigma }(t)\leq
C_{3}\sup_{r\in (0,R_{0})}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma }(r)\leq C_{3}^{\prime
}\liminf_{r\rightarrow 0}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma }(r)\leq C_{3}^{\prime \prime
}\liminf_{t\rightarrow 0}\Psi _{u}^{\sigma }(t).  \label{ne_ke2}
\end{equation}%
Thus, Theorem \ref{thm4} (ii) holds by \eqref{ke_ne2} and \eqref{ne_ke2}.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
We establish the equivalence of properties (KE) and (NE)
under the full two-sided heat kernel estimates (UHE) and (LHE).  We say that
a heat kernel $\{p_{t}\}_{t>0}$ satisfies near diagonal lower estimate
(NLE), if there exists $\delta \in (0,\infty)$ such that, for all $t\in
(0,R_{0}^{\beta ^{\ast}}) $ and $\mu $-almost all $x,y\in M$ :
\begin{equation}
p_{t}(x,y)\geq \frac{c_{1}}{V(x,t^{1/\beta ^{\ast }})}\ \ \ \text{whenever }
\ d(x,y)\leq \delta t^{1/\beta ^{\ast }}.  \label{NLE}
\end{equation}
We conjecture that Lemma \ref{thm1} and Lemma \ref{thm_1} cannot be derived
from (UHE) and (NLE) without further assumptions (like the chain condition).
\end{remark}

By Theorem \ref{thm4} and Remark \ref{rk1}, we have the following
interesting corollary for $p=2$, which is important for defining a local
Dirichlet form based on Besov norms.

\begin{corollary}
\label{jjjj} Suppose that $(M,d,\mu )$ admits a heat kernel $\{p_{t}\}_{t>0}$
satisfying (UHE) and (LHE), then (NE) holds when $p=2$.
\end{corollary}

\section{Connected homogeneous p.c.f self-similar sets and their glue-ups}

\label{sec5} In this section, we work with `fractal glue-ups' using
connected homogeneous p.c.f self-similar sets as `tiles', which can be both
bounded and unbounded. We first obtain their equivalent discrete semi-norms
(vertex energies). Then we introduce weak-monotonicity properties for vertex
energies, including property (E) in \cite[Definition 3.1]{GaoYuZhang2022PA},
properties (VE) and $(\widetilde{VE})$. We will verify property (E) on
nested fractals, and our main goal is to show the equivalence of (KE) and
(VE). Lastly, we show that aforementioned consequences hold for certain
`fractal glue-ups', for example, nested fractals and their fractal blow-ups.

\subsection{Equivalent discrete semi-norms of fractal glue-ups}

\label{subsec5.1} Let us first introduce connected homogeneous p.c.f.
self-similar sets in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$. Let $\{\phi _{i}\}_{i=1}^{N}$ be an
IFS which consists of $\rho $-similitudes on $\mathbb{R}^{d}$, i.e. for $%
i=1,...,N$, $N\geq 2$, each $\phi _{i}:\mathbb{R}^{d}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}%
^{d}$ is of the form
\begin{equation}
\phi _{i}(x)=\rho (x-b_{i})+b_{i},  \label{phi_i}
\end{equation}%
where $\rho \in (0,1)$, $b_{i}\in \mathbb{R}^{d}$. Suppose that $K$ is the
attractor of the IFS $\{\phi _{i}\}_{i=1}^{N}$, i.e. $K$ is the unique
non-empty compact set in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ satisfying
\begin{equation*}
K=\tbigcup_{i=1}^{N}\phi _{i}(K).
\end{equation*}%
To explain what `p.c.f' is, we introduce the natural symbolic space
associated with our IFS $\{\phi _{i}\}_{i=1}^{N}$. Let $W=\{1,2,...,N\}$, $%
W_{n}$ be the set of words with length $n$ over $W$, and $W^{\mathbb{N}}$ be
the set of all infinite words over $W$. Let $w=\mathrm{w_{1}w_{2}}...\in W^{%
\mathbb{N}}$ and let the canonical projection $\pi :$ $W^{\mathbb{N}%
}\rightarrow K$ be defined by $\pi (w):=\tbigcap\limits_{n\in \mathbb{N}%
^{\ast }}F_{\mathrm{w_{1}...w_{n}}}(K),$ where $F_{\mathrm{w_{1}...w_{n}}%
}:=F_{\mathrm{w_{1}}}\circ ...\circ F_{\mathrm{w_{n}}}$, and $K_w=F_w(K)$.
Then we can define the critical set $\Gamma $ and the post-critical set $%
\mathcal{P}$ by
\begin{equation*}
\Gamma =\pi ^{-1}\left( \tbigcup_{1\leq i<j\leq N}\left( \phi _{i}(K)\cap
\phi _{j}(K)\right) \right) ,\quad \mathcal{P}=\tbigcup_{m\geq 1}\tau
^{m}(\Gamma ),
\end{equation*}%
where $\tau $ is the left shift by one index on $W^{\mathbb{N}}$ (see \cite[%
Definition 1.3.13]{Kigami.2001.}). We say the IFS is \emph{post-critically
finite} (p.c.f.) if $\mathcal{P}$ is finite. Define
\begin{equation*}
V_{0}=\pi (\mathcal{P}),\quad V_{w}:=F_{w}\left( V_{0}\right), \quad V_{n}=\tbigcup_{w\in W_{n}}V_{w} ,\quad V_{\ast }=\tbigcup_{n\geq 1}V_{n},
\end{equation*}%
then $K$ is the closure of $V_{\ast }$ with respect to the Euclidean metric. For $w\in W_n$, $K_{w}:=F_{w}\left( K\right) $ is called a $n$-cell of $K$. Without loss of generality, we always assume that
\textrm{diam}$(K)=1$ by an affine transformation on $\{b_{i}\}_{i=1}^{N}$.
From now on, denote by $K$ a homogeneous p.c.f. self-similar set that is
connected. It is known that a homogeneous p.c.f. IFS in the form of (\ref%
{phi_i}) satisfies the \emph{open set condition} (OSC) (see, for example
\cite[Theorem 1.1]{Denglau.2008}). Hence the Hausdorff dimension of $K$ is $%
\alpha =\func{dim}_{H}(K)=-\log N/\log \rho$, and the $\mathcal{H}^{\alpha }$%
-measure of $K$, denoted by $\mu $, is \emph{$\alpha $-regular}.

It is proved in \cite[Proposition 2.5]{GuLau.2020.AASFM} that, \emph{%
Condition(H)} holds for connected homogeneous p.c.f. self-similar sets. That
is, there exists $c>0$ depending only on $K$ such that, for any two words $w$
and $w^{\prime }$ with the same length $m\geq 1$, $K_{w}\cap K_{w^{\prime
}}=\emptyset $ implies that $\func{dist}\left( K_{w},K_{w^{\prime }}\right)
\geq c\rho ^{m}$.

In order to unify the notation for bounded and unbounded fractals, we
introduce the concept of \emph{fractal glue-ups}. The definition is adapted
from the idea of fractafold in \cite{StrichartzTeplyaev2012} but not the
same. Given a compact set $K\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ and a set $F$ of
similitudes on $\mathbb{R}^d$, we can define
\begin{equation*}
K^F:=\bigcup_{f\in F}f(K)\subset \mathbb{R}^d.
\end{equation*}
For our study, we naturally need the following requirements.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Isometries: all similitudes in $F$ have contraction ratio 1, that is,
each similitude in $F$ is an isometry of $K$.

\item Just-touching property: for any $f\neq g\in F$,
\begin{equation*}
f(K)\tbigcap g(K)=f(V_0)\tbigcap g(V_0).
\end{equation*}

\item Condition (H): There exists a constant $C_{H}\in (0,1)$ such that, if $%
|x-y|<C_{H}\rho ^{m}$ with $x\in f_{1}(K_{w})$ and $y\in f_{2}(K_{\tilde{w}%
}) $ for two words $w$ and $\tilde{w}$ with the same length $m\geq0$, then $%
f_{1}(K_{w})$ intersects $f_{2}(K_{\tilde{w}})$.

\item Connectedness: $K^{F}$ is connected.
\end{enumerate}

%These conditions are natural settings in the study of homogeneous p.c.f. fractals. Condition (1) resembles the homogeneity on large scales; Condition (2) resembles the p.c.f. property;Condition (3) is satisfied for each tile $K$ and is widely used in previous studies.

From now on, whenever we mention a \emph{fractal glue-up} $K^{F}$, we
automatically assume that these four conditions are satisfied. We call each $%
f(K),f\in F$ a \emph{tile}, and we just simply glue these tiles up which
only overlap at boundaries by the `just-touching' property. Conditions (2)
and (3) imply the following \emph{uniform finitely-joint} property.

\begin{proposition}[Uniform finitely-joint property]
For any metric ball $B(x,R)$ of radius $R>0$ in $K^F$, the number of tiles
that intersect it is bounded by a constant $C_K(R)<\infty$, which depends
only on $C_H$ and the IFS. Thus for any tile $f(K)$, the number of tiles $%
\tilde{f}(K)$ that intersect it is bounded by $C_K(1)$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Denote all the tiles that intersect $B(x,R)$ by $f_{n}(K),\ 1\leq n\leq
N_{0} $ (here $N_{0}$ might be $\infty $). Denote by $t$ the smallest
integer satisfying
\begin{equation*}
N^t>|V_0|.
\end{equation*}
Choose an `interior' (away from boundaries) level-$t$ cell $\phi_{w}(K)$ ($%
|w|=t$) that does not intersect $V_{0}$, which exists by the pigeonhole
principle. Condition (H) implies that all $f_{n}(\phi _{w}(K))$ are
separated by distance $C_{H}\rho ^{t}$ for $1\leq n\leq N_{0}$, but they all
belong to the ball $B(x,R+1)$ since the diameter of the tiles are all 1.
This means that $N_{0}$ is uniformly bounded, since there are $N_{0}$
disjoint balls $B(f_{n}(\phi _{w}(v)),C_{H}\rho ^{t}/2)$ inside a ball with
diameter $R+1$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, that is, $C_K(R)$ is the maximal number of
disjoint balls of radii $C_{H}\rho ^{t}/2$ inside a ball with diameter $R+1$
in $\mathbb{R}^d$. The second inclusion directly follows by choosing $R=1$
and $x\in f(K)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
The concept of the fractal glue-up provides a quick way to unify the notions
of bounded and unbounded fractals. For example, $K=K^{F}$ when $F=\{Id\}$.
We are mainly interested in the following unbounded fractal by blowing up $K$
defined by Strichartz in \cite[Section 3]{Strichartz.1998.CJM}. However,
fractal glue-ups lack self-similarity on large scales in general.
\end{remark}

\begin{example}[Fractal blow-up]\label{ex1} Let $\{\phi _{i}\}_{i=1}^{N}$ be defined as in (\ref{phi_i}). Assume that
\textrm{diam}$(K)=1$ by an affine transformation on $\{b_{i}\}_{i=1}^{N}$ with $b_{1}=0$ and define
\begin{equation*}
K_{l}:=\underbrace{\phi _{1}^{-1}\circ \phi _{1}^{-1}\circ \cdots \circ \phi
_{1}^{-1}}_{l}K=\rho^{-l}K=\tbigcup _{f\in F_{l}}f(K),
\end{equation*}%
where $F_{l}=\left\{x+\sum_{j=1}^{l}\rho ^{-j}c_{j}: c_{j}\in \{(1-\rho)b_{i}\}_{i=1}^{N}\right\}$.

Clearly, $F_{l}$ and $K_{l}$ are increasing sequences, so that
$K=K_{0}\subseteq K_{1}\subseteq K_{2}\subseteq \cdots $.

The final fractal blow-up of $K$ is in the form $K^{F}$ with $F=\bigcup_{l=1}^{\infty }
F_{l}= \lim_{l\rightarrow\infty} F_l$, and denote it by
\begin{equation*}
K_{\infty }=\tbigcup _{l=1}^{\infty }K_{l}= \lim_{l\rightarrow\infty} K_l.
\end{equation*}\end{example}
%We illustrate the fractal blow-up of the Sierpi\'{n}ski gasket $K$ (the
%highlighted area) in Fig.1.
%\begin{figure}[tbph]
%\flushright
%\includegraphics[width=8cm]{fig2.jpg}\newline
%\caption{The blow-up of the Sierpi\'{n}ski gasket}
%\label{fig1}
%\end{figure}

From now on, we always assume that $K$ is a connected homogeneous p.c.f.
self-similar set when we say that $K^{F}$ is a fractal glue-up. In what follows, we use
the superscript $F$ to distinguish the underlying space $K$ and $K^{F}$ for
the energies and norms etc.

Define
\begin{equation}
\mu ^{F}:=\sum_{f\in F}\mu \circ f^{-1},  \label{muF}
\end{equation}%
i.e., just `glue' up the measures for each tile. Then $\mu
^{F}$ is $\alpha $-regular by our assumptions on $F$. Following the definition of Besov semi-norms on $%
K$, denote Besov semi-norms on $K^{F}$ by
\begin{equation}
\lbrack u]_{B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma ,F}}^{p}:=\sup_{n\geq 0}\Phi
_{u}^{\sigma ,F}(C_H\rho ^{n}),  \label{ct}
\end{equation}%
where $\Phi _{u}^{\sigma ,F}(r):=r^{-(p\sigma +\alpha
)}\int_{K^{F}}\int_{B(x,r)}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}d\mu ^{F}(y)d\mu ^{F}(x)$, and
define
\begin{equation*}
B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma ,F}:=\{u\in L^{p}(K^{F},\mu ^{F}):[u]_{B_{p,\infty
}^{\sigma ,F}}<\infty \}.
\end{equation*}%
It is easy to see that%
\begin{equation}
\sup_{n\geq 0}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma ,F}(C_H\rho ^{n})\asymp
\sup_{r\in (0,C_H)}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma ,F}(r),  \label{ns}
\end{equation}%
this means%
\begin{equation}
B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma ,F}=B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma }(K^{F})\text{ \ \ and\ \ \ }%
[u]_{B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma ,F}}\asymp \lbrack u]_{B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma
}(K^{F})}\text{ (with }R_{0}=C_H\text{ in (\ref{pi})).}
\label{BC}
\end{equation}
Also, we have%
\begin{equation}
\liminf_{n\rightarrow \infty }\Phi _{u}^{\sigma ,F}(\rho ^{n})\asymp
\liminf_{r\rightarrow 0}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma ,F}(r)\text{ \ \ and \ \ }%
\limsup_{n\rightarrow \infty }\Phi _{u}^{\sigma ,F}(\rho ^{n})\asymp
\limsup_{r\rightarrow 0}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma ,F}(r).  \label{ne}
\end{equation}

We need the following Morrey-Sobolev inequality to show that $B_{p,\infty
}^{\sigma }(K^F)$ essentially embeds into $C(K^F)$ when $\sigma >\alpha /p$.

\begin{lemma}
(\cite[Theorem 3.2]{BaudoinLecture2022}) \label{lemmaMR} Let $(M,d,\mu )$ be
a metric measure space with $\mu $ satisfying (\ref{alpha_r}). When $\sigma
>\alpha /p$, for any $u\in B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma }(M)$, there exists a
continuous version $\tilde{u}\in C^{(p\sigma -\alpha )/p}(M)$ satisfying $%
\tilde{u}=u$ $\mu $-almost everywhere in $M$ and
\begin{equation}
|\tilde{u}(x)-\tilde{u}(y)|\leq C|x-y|^{(p\sigma -\alpha )/p}\sup_{r\in

\end{equation}%
for all $x,$ $y\in M$ with $d(x,y)<R_{0}/3$, where $C$ is a positive
constant (Here $C^{\beta }(M)$ denotes the class of H\"{o}lder continuous
functions of order $\beta $ on $M$ ).

Next, we estimate%
\begin{equation*}
I_{\infty ,n}^{F}(u):=\int_{K^{F}}\int_{B(x,C_{H}\rho

By (\ref{ct}), for all $u\in B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma ,F}$,
\begin{equation}
\rho ^{-n(p\sigma +\alpha )}I_{\infty ,n}^{F}(u)=C_{H}^{p\sigma +\alpha
}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma ,F}(C_{H}\rho ^{n}).  \label{ct-1}

Denote the Borel measure $\mu _{m}$ on $V_{m}$ by
\begin{equation*}
\mu _{m}:=\frac{1}{|V_{m}|}\sum_{a\in V_{m}}\delta _{a},
\end{equation*}%
and define
\begin{equation}
\mu _{m}^{F}:=\sum_{f\in F}\mu_m\circ f^{-1}=\sum_{f\in F}\frac{1}{|V_{m}|}%
\sum_{a\in V_{m}}\delta _{f(a)},  \label{200}
\end{equation}%
where $\delta _{a}$ is the Dirac measure at point $a$ and $|A|$ denotes the
cardinality of a finite set $A$.

Let
\begin{equation}
I_{m,n}^{F}(u):=\int_{K^{F}}\int_{B(x,C_{H}\rho ^{n})}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}d\mu
_{m}^{F}(y)d\mu _{m}^{F}(x),  \label{201}
\end{equation}%
which can be regarded as the `ball-energy'. We will use these discrete sums
to estimate the integral norms. To do this, we need the following lemma.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem4.4}Let $K^{F}$ be a fractal glue-up. Then for all $u\in C(K^F)$,
\begin{equation}
\liminf_{m\rightarrow \infty }I_{m,n}^{F}(u)\geq I_{\infty ,n}^{F}(u).
\label{mu_m}
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}

The proof of this lemma is based on the proof of \cite[Lemma 3.2]%
{GuLau.2020.AASFM}, however, a formula used in \cite[Lemma 3.2]%
{GuLau.2020.AASFM} is not obvious. We add an argument for this formula to
ensure the validity of \cite[Lemma 3.2]{GuLau.2020.AASFM}. We may assume
that $K$ is not contained in any hyperplane $H\subset \mathbb{R}^{d}$,
otherwise we may reduce the IFS to $H$ by restricting each similitude $\phi
_{i}$ to $H$, and a simple affine transformation on $H$ to its dimension $%
d^{\prime }$ gives a scaled copy of $K$ to $\mathbb{R}^{d^{\prime }}$. Thus
we can apply \cite[Proposition 2.4]{GuLau.2020.AASFM}.

\begin{proposition}
Assume that $K$ is not contained in any hyperplane $H\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}$.
For any $r>0$, let $E(r):=\bigcup_{x\in K}\{x\}\times \partial B(x,r).$ Then
$\mu \times \mu (E(r))=0$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Define the closed annulus
\begin{equation*}
R_{x}(a,b):=\overline{B(x,a)}\setminus B(x,b).
\end{equation*}%
Fix $x_{w}\in K_{w}$ where $w\in W_n$. Then
\begin{equation*}
\bigcup_{x\in K_{w}}\partial B(x,r)\subset R_{x_{w}}(r-\rho ^{n},r+\rho
^{n}),
\end{equation*}%
since for any $y\in \partial B(x,r)$, $d(x,y)=r$ and $d(x,x_{w})\leq \rho
^{n}$, thus $d(y,x_{w})\in \lbrack r-\rho ^{n},r+\rho ^{n}].$ Note that
\begin{equation*}
E(r):=\bigcup_{x\in K}\{x\}\times \partial B(x,r)\subset \bigcup_{w\in
W_{n}}K_{w}\times R_{x_{w}}(r-\rho ^{n},r+\rho ^{n}),
\end{equation*}
thus
\begin{align*}
\mu \times \mu (E(r))& \leq \sum_{w\in W_{n}}\mu (K_{w})\mu
(R_{x_{w}}(r-\rho ^{n},r+\rho ^{n})) \\
&\leq \mu (K)\sup_{w\in W_{n}}\mu (R_{x_{w}}(r-\rho ^{n},r+\rho ^{n})) \\
&\leq \mu (K)\sup_{x\in K}\mu (R_{x}(r-\rho ^{n},r+\rho ^{n})).
\end{align*}

We claim that
\begin{equation*}
\sup_{x\in K}\mu (R_{x}(r-\rho ^{n},r+\rho ^{n}))\rightarrow 0\text{ as }%
n\rightarrow \infty .
\end{equation*}%
Otherwise, if $\mu (R_{x_{n}}(r-\rho ^{n},r+\rho ^{n}))\geq \delta >0$
for a subsequence $\{x_{n}\}_n\subset K$, we may choose a subsequence $%
\{x_{n_{i}}\}_i$ that converge to $x_{\infty }\in K$ due to the compactness
of $K$, and further require that $d(x_{n_{i}},x_{\infty })$ decrease in $i$.
Then
\begin{equation*}
A_{i}:=R_{x_{\infty }}(r-\rho ^{n_{i}}-d(x_{n_{i}},x_{\infty }),r+\rho
^{n_{i}}+d(x_{n_{i}},x_{\infty }))\supset R_{x_{n_{i}}}(r-\rho
^{n_{i}},r+\rho ^{n_{i}})
\end{equation*}%
and $A_{i}\downarrow \partial B(x_{\infty },r)$, thus
\begin{equation*}
\mu (\partial B(x_{\infty },r))=\lim_{i\rightarrow \infty }\mu (A_{i})\geq
\delta ,
\end{equation*}%
which contradicts \cite[Proposition 2.4]{GuLau.2020.AASFM} that $\mu
(\partial B(x,r))=0$ for any $x\in K$! The proof is done by this claim.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Lemma \protect\ref{lem4.4}]
Suppose $F=\{f_{i}\}_{i\geq 1}$ and denote $F_{k}=\{f_{i}\}_{1\leq i\leq k}$%
. As $\mu _{m}$ weak $\ast $-converges to $\mu $, we know by definition that
the finite glue-up measure $\mu _{m}^{F_{k}}$ weak $\ast $-converges to $\mu
^{F_{k}}$ on $K^{F_{k}}$ (the pieces $f_{i}(K)$ are mutually measure-disjoint),
and that $\mu ^{F_{k}}$ is exactly the restriction of $\mu ^{F}$ to $K^{F_{k}}$.
Using the same argument as \cite[Lemma 3.2]{GuLau.2020.AASFM}, for $u\in C(K^F)$, we have
\begin{eqnarray*}
&&\lim_{m\rightarrow \infty }I_{m,n}^{F_{k}}(u)=\lim_{m\rightarrow \infty
}\int_{K^{F_{k}}}\int_{B(x,C_{H}\rho ^{n})}|u(a)-u(b)|^{p}d\mu
_{m}^{F_{k}}(b)d\mu _{m}^{F_{k}}(a) \\
&=&\int_{K^{F_{k}}}\int_{B(x,C_{H}\rho ^{n})}|u(a)-u(b)|^{p}d\mu
^{F_{k}}(b)d\mu ^{F_{k}}(a):=I_{\infty ,n}^{F_{k}}(u).
\end{eqnarray*}

Note that the nonnegative sequence $a_{m,k}:=I_{m,n}^{F_{k}}(u)\uparrow
I_{m,n}^{F}(u):=a_{m,\infty }$ when $k\rightarrow \infty $, and we have just
shown that $\lim_{m\rightarrow \infty }a_{m,k}=I_{\infty ,n}^{F_{k}}(u)$.
Denote $a_{m,0}=I_{\infty ,n}^{F_{0}}(u)=0$, then
\begin{equation}
I_{m,n}^{F}(u)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty }(a_{m,k+1}-a_{m,k})  \label{4.8-1}
\end{equation}%
and by noting that
\begin{equation*}
\liminf_{m\rightarrow \infty }(a_{m,k+1}-a_{m,k})=I_{\infty
,n}^{F_{k+1}}(u)-I_{\infty ,n}^{F_{k}}(u),
\end{equation*}%
our conclusion directly follows from Fatou's Lemma.
\end{proof}

We are now in the position for the first estimate lemma.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem6.2} Let $K^{F}$ be a fractal glue-up. If $\sigma >\alpha /p$,
then for all $u\in B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma ,F}$,
\begin{equation}
I_{\infty ,n}^{F}(u)\leq C\rho ^{2n\alpha }\sum_{k=n}^{\infty
}E_{k}^{(p),F}(u)\leq C^{\prime }\rho ^{n(p\sigma +\alpha )}\sup_{k\geq n}%
\mathcal{E}_{k}^{\sigma ,F}(u).  \label{eq6.3}
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $I_{m,n}^{F}(u)$ be defined as in (\ref{201}) ($m>n)$. Since $K^{F}$ is
connected and satisfies the condition $(\mathrm{H})$, $|x-y|\leq C_{H}\rho
^{n}$ implies that\ $x,y$ lie in the same or the neighboring $n$-cells. For
every $w\in W_{n}$ and $x\in f(K_{w})$, if $y\in B(x,C_{H}\rho ^{n})$, then
there exists $(g,\tilde{w})\in F\times W_{n}$ such that $y\in g(K_{\tilde{w}%
})$ and
\begin{equation*}
g(K_{\tilde{w}})\cap f(K_{w})\neq \emptyset .
\end{equation*}%
Therefore,
\begin{align*}
I_{m,n}^{F}(u)\leq & \sum_{|w|=n}\sum_{f\in F}\int_{f(K_{w})}\left( \sum_{|%
\tilde{w}|=n}\sum_{g\in F}\int_{g(K_{\tilde{w}})}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}1_{\{g(K_{%
\tilde{w}})\cap f(K_{w})\neq \emptyset \}}d\mu _{m}^{F}(y)\right) d\mu
_{m}^{F}(x) \\
=& \sum_{|w|=n}\sum_{f\in F}\sum_{|\tilde{w}|=n}\sum_{g\in F}\sum_{x\in
f(K_{w}\cap V_{m})}\sum_{y\in g(K_{\tilde{w}}\cap V_{m})}\frac{1_{\{g(K_{%
\tilde{w}})\cap f(K_{w})\neq \emptyset \}}}{|V_{m}|^{2}}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}.
\end{align*}%
When $g(K_{\tilde{w}})\cap f(K_{w})\neq \emptyset $, we can find a common
vertex of these two cells and denote it by $z\in f(V_{w})\cap g(V_{\tilde{w}%
})$, due to the just-touching property when $f\neq g$ and the p.c.f.
structure when $f=g$. Furthermore, by the elementary inequality $%
|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}\leq 2^{p-1}\left( |u(x)-u(z)|^{p}+|u(z)-u(y)|^{p}\right) $,
\begin{equation*}
1_{\{g(K_{\tilde{w}})\cap f(K_{w})\neq \emptyset \}}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}\leq
2^{p-1}\sum_{z\in f(V_{w})\cap g(V_{\tilde{w}})}\left(
|u(x)-u(z)|^{p}+|u(z)-u(y)|^{p}\right) .
\end{equation*}%
It follows that
\begin{align}
I_{m,n}^{F}(u)\leq & 2^{p-1}\sum_{|w|=n}\sum_{f\in F}\sum_{|\tilde{w}%
|=n}\sum_{g\in F}\sum_{x\in f(K_{w}\cap V_{m})}\sum_{y\in g(K_{\tilde{w}%
}\cap V_{m})}\sum_{z\in f(V_{w})\cap g(V_{\tilde{w}})}\frac{1}{|V_{m}|^{2}}%
\left( |u(x)-u(z)|^{p}+|u(z)-u(y)|^{p}\right)  \notag \\
\leq & C_{1}N^{-2m}\sum_{|w|=n}\sum_{f\in F}\sum_{|\tilde{w}|=n}\sum_{g\in
F}\sum_{z\in f(V_{w})\cap g(V_{\tilde{w}})}\sum_{x\in f(K_{w}\cap
V_{m})}\sum_{y\in g(K_{\tilde{w}}\cap V_{m})}\left(
|u(x)-u(z)|^{p}+|u(z)-u(y)|^{p}\right)  \notag \\
\leq & C_{1}N^{-2m}\sum_{|w|=n}\sum_{f\in F}\sum_{z\in f(V_{w})}\sum_{x\in
f(K_{w}\cap V_{m})}|u(x)-u(z)|^{p}\left( \sum_{|\tilde{w}|=n}\sum_{g\in
F}1_{\{z\in f(V_{w})\cap g(V_{\tilde{w}})\}}|g(K_{\tilde{w}}\cap
V_{m})|\right)  \notag \\
& +C_{1}N^{-2m}\sum_{|\tilde{w}|=n}\sum_{g\in F}\sum_{z\in g(V_{\tilde{w}%
})}\sum_{y\in g(K_{\tilde{w}}\cap V_{m})}|u(z)-u(y)|^{p}\left(
\sum_{|w|=n}\sum_{f\in F}1_{\{z\in f(V_{w})\cap g(V_{\tilde{w}%
})\}}|f(K_{w}\cap V_{m})|\right)  \notag \\
\leq & C_{2}N^{-(m+n)}\left(\sum_{|w|=n}\sum_{f\in F}\sum_{z\in
f(V_{w})}\sum_{x\in f(K_{w}\cap V_{m})}|u(x)-u(z)|^{p} +\sum_{|\tilde{w}%
|=n}\sum_{g\in F}\sum_{z\in g(V_{\tilde{w}})}\sum_{y\in g(K_{\tilde{w}}\cap
V_{m})}|u(z)-u(y)|^{p} \right)  \notag \\
=& 2C_{2}N^{-(m+n)}\sum_{|w|=n}\sum_{f\in F}\sum_{x\in f(K_{w}\cap
V_{m})}\sum_{z\in f(V_{w})}|u(x)-u(z)|^{p},  \label{eq5.6}
\end{align}%
where we use the uniform finitely-joint property for each common vertex $%
z\in f(V_{w})\cap g(V_{\tilde{w}})$ in the last inequality, so that
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{|\tilde{w}|=n}\sum_{g\in F}1_{\{z\in f(V_{w})\cap g(V_{\tilde{w}})\}}
\end{equation*}%
is uniformly bounded for any $(f,w)\in F\times W_{n}$, and the elementary
estimates
\begin{eqnarray}
|V_{m}| &\asymp &N^{m}=\rho ^{-\alpha m},  \label{v1} \\
\text{\ }|K_{w}\cap V_{m}| &\asymp &N^{m-n}\text{ for every }w\in W_{n}.
\label{v2}
\end{eqnarray}%
Since $x,z$ belong to the same tile $f(K)$, we apply the same estimate for $%
|u(x)-u(z)|^{p}$ as \cite[(2.6)]{GaoYuZhang2022PA}, and for reader's
convenience we present it here. For such $x\in f(V_{m}),z\in f(V_{n})$, one
can naturally fix a decreasing sequence of cells $K_{w_{k}}$ with $|w_{k}|=k$
for $k=n,\cdots ,m$ and vertices $x_{k}(x,z)\in V_{w_{k}}$ such that, $%
z=x_{n}(x,z),\ x=x_{m}(x,z)$, so by H\"{o}lder's inequality we have
\begin{align}
|u(z)-u(x)|^{p}\leq & \left( \sum_{k=n}^{m-1}N^{(n-k)q/p}\right)
^{p/q}\left(
\sum_{k=n}^{m-1}N^{k-n}|u(x_{k}(x,z))-u(x_{k+1}(x,z))|^{p}\right)  \notag \\
\leq & C_{3}\sum_{k=n}^{m-1}N^{k-n}|u(x_{k}(x,z))-u(x_{k+1}(x,z))|^{p},
\label{u_xz}
\end{align}%
where $q=p/(p-1)$. Note that for every pair $(a,b)\in f(K_{w^{\prime }}\cap
V_{k})\times f(K_{w^{\prime }}\cap V_{k+1})$, the cardinality of $(x,z)\in
f(K_{w}\cap V_{m})\times f(V_{w})$ with $(x_{k}(x,z),x_{k+1}(x,z))=(a,b)$ is
no greater than $C^{\prime }N^{m-k}$ for some $C^{\prime }>0$, due to the
p.c.f. structure. Substituting \eqref{u_xz} into \eqref{eq5.6}, we obtain
\begin{align}
I_{m,n}^{F}(u)& \leq C_{4}N^{-(m+n)}\sum_{|w|=n}\sum_{f\in F}\sum_{(x,z)\in
f(K_{w}\cap V_{m})\times
f(V_{w})}\sum_{k=n}^{m-1}N^{k-n}|u(x_{k}(x,z))-u(x_{k+1}(x,z))|^{p}  \notag
\\
& \leq C_{4}N^{-(m+n)}\sum_{|w|=n}\sum_{k=n}^{m-1}\sum_{f\in F}\sum_{\QATOP{%
|w^{\prime }|=k}{f(K_{w^{\prime }})\subset f(K_{w})}}\sum_{\QATOP{(x,z)\in
f(K_{w}\cap V_{m})\times f(V_{w}),}{(a,b)\in f(K_{w^{\prime }}\cap
V_{k})\times f(K_{w^{\prime }}\cap V_{k+1})}}N^{k-n}|u(a)-u(b)|^{p}  \notag
\\
& \leq C_{5}N^{-(m+n)}\sum_{|w|=n}\sum_{k=n}^{m-1}\sum_{f\in F}\sum_{\QATOP{%
|w^{\prime }|=k}{f(K_{w^{\prime }})\subset f(K_{w})}}\sum_{a,b\in
f(K_{w^{\prime }}\cap V_{k+1})}N^{k-n}\cdot N^{m-k}|u(a)-u(b)|^{p}  \notag \\
& =C_{5}\rho ^{2n\alpha }\sum_{k=n}^{m-1}\sum_{|w|=n}\sum_{f\in F}\sum_{%
\QATOP{|w^{\prime }|=k}{f(K_{w^{\prime }})\subset f(K_{w})}}\sum_{a,b\in
f(K_{w^{\prime }}\cap V_{k+1})}|u(a)-u(b)|^{p}  \notag \\
& \leq C_{6}\rho ^{2n\alpha }\sum_{k=n}^{m-1}\sum_{f\in
F}E_{k+1}^{(p)}(u\circ f)\leq C_{6}\rho ^{2n\alpha
}\sum_{k=n}^{m}E_{k}^{(p),F}(u),  \label{I_mn}
\end{align}%
where we have used \eqref{p_energy} in the last line. It follows that
\begin{equation*}
I_{m,n}^{F}(u)\leq C_{6}\rho ^{2n\alpha }\rho ^{n(p\sigma -\alpha
)}\sum_{k=n}^{m}\rho ^{-n(p\sigma -\alpha )}E_{k}^{(p),F}(u)\leq C_{7}\rho
^{n(p\sigma +\alpha )}\sup_{k\geq n}\mathcal{E}_{k}^{\sigma ,F}(u),
\end{equation*}%
which ends the proof by letting $m\rightarrow \infty $ and using Lemma \ref{lem4.4}.
\end{proof}

The following simple proposition is required.

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:I}For all $u\in B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma ,F}$, we have
\begin{eqnarray}
\liminf_{n\rightarrow \infty }\rho ^{-n(p\sigma +\alpha )}I_{\infty
,n}^{F}(u) &\geq &\rho ^{p\sigma +\alpha }C_{H}^{p\sigma +\alpha
}\liminf_{n\rightarrow \infty }\Phi _{u}^{\sigma ,F}(\rho ^{n}),
\label{II-1} \\
\limsup_{n\rightarrow \infty }\rho ^{-n(p\sigma +\alpha )}I_{\infty
,n}^{F}(u) &\geq &\rho ^{p\sigma +\alpha }C_{H}^{p\sigma +\alpha
}\limsup_{n\rightarrow \infty }\Phi _{u}^{\sigma ,F}(\rho ^{n}).
\label{II-3}
\end{eqnarray}

\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Since $C_{H}\in (0,1)$, assume that $\rho ^{s+1}\leq C_{H}<\rho ^{s}$ for
some nonnegative integer $s$. Then, for any integer $n$,
\begin{eqnarray}
\rho ^{-n(p\sigma +\alpha )}I_{\infty ,n}^{F}(u) &=&\rho ^{-n(p\sigma
+\alpha )}\int_{K^{F}}\int_{B(x,C_{H}\rho ^{n})}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}d\mu
^{F}(y)d\mu ^{F}(x)  \notag \\
&\geq &\rho ^{-n(p\sigma +\alpha )}\int_{K^{F}}\int_{B(x,\rho
^{n+s+1})}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}d\mu ^{F}(y)d\mu ^{F}(x)  \label{II-2} \\
&=&\rho ^{(s+1)(p\sigma +\alpha )}\rho ^{-(n+s+1)(p\sigma +\alpha
)}\int_{K^{F}}\int_{B(x,\rho ^{n+s+1})}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}d\mu ^{F}(y)d\mu
^{F}(x)  \notag \\
&>&\rho ^{p\sigma +\alpha }C_{H}^{p\sigma +\alpha }\rho ^{-(n+s+1)(p\sigma
+\alpha )}\int_{K^{F}}\int_{B(x,\rho ^{n+s+1})}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}d\mu
^{F}(y)d\mu ^{F}(x).  \notag
\end{eqnarray}%
Taking $\liminf_{n\rightarrow \infty }$ and $\limsup_{n\rightarrow \infty }$
in both side, we obtain (\ref{II-1}) and (\ref{II-3}).
\end{proof}

Denote the `ring-energy' by
\begin{equation*}
I_{n}^{F}(u):=\int_{K^{F}}\int_{\{\rho ^{n+1}\leq d(x,y)<\rho
^{n}\}}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}d\mu ^{F}(y)d\mu ^{F}(x),
\end{equation*}%
which will be used later for the `truncation trick' instead of the
`ball-energy'.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem6.3} Let $K^{F}$ be a fractal glue-up. If $\sigma >\alpha /p$,
then for any $\delta \in (0,p\sigma -\alpha )$ and $u\in B_{p,\infty
}^{\sigma ,F}$,
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{E}_{n}^{\sigma ,F}(u)\leq C\sum_{k=0}^{\infty }\rho ^{(-2\alpha
-\delta )k}\rho ^{-(p\sigma +\alpha )n}I_{k+n}^{F}\leq C^{\prime
}\sup_{k\geq 0}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma ,F}(\rho ^{n+k}).  \label{eq6.4}
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
For $a,b\in f(K_{w})$, we have $|u(a)-u(b)|^{p}\leq
2^{p-1}(|u(a)-u(x)|^{p}+|u(x)-u(b)|^{p})$, where $x\in f(K_{w})$ and $f\in F$%
. Approximate $F$ with increasing finite sets $F_{j}$ so that $%
F=\lim_{j\rightarrow \infty }F_{j}$. Integrating with respect to $x$ and
dividing by $\mu ^{F}(f(K_{w}))$, we have
\begin{align}
E_{n}^{(p),F_{j}}(u)& =\sum_{f\in F_{j}}\sum_{a,b\in
f(V_{w}),|w|=n}|u(a)-u(b)|^{p}  \notag \\
& \leq 2^{p-1}\sum_{f\in F_{j}}\sum_{a,b\in f(V_{w}),a\neq b,|w|=n}\left(
\frac{1}{\mu ^{F}(f(K_{w}))}\int_{f(K_{w})}|u(a)-u(x)|^{p}+|u(x)-u(b)|^{p}d%
\mu ^{F}(x)\right)  \notag \\
& \leq 2^{p-1}|V_{0}|\sum_{f\in F_{j}}\sum_{a\in f(V_{w}),|w|=n}\frac{1}{\mu
^{F}(f(K_{w}))}\int_{f(K_{w})}|u(a)-u(x)|^{p}d\mu ^{F}(x).  \label{lem3.0}
\end{align}%
For every $a\in f(V_{w})$ with $|w|=n$, we can fix a decreasing sequence of
cells $\{f(K_{w_{k}})\}_{k=n}^{m}$ where $|w_{k}|=k$ for all large enough $%
m>n$, such that $a\in \cap _{k=n}^{m}f(K_{w_{k}})$ with $w_{n}=w$. We choose
$x_{k}\in f(K_{w_{k}})$ for $k=n,n+1,...m$. Let $\delta \in (0,p\sigma
-\alpha )$, by H\"{o}lder's inequality,
\begin{align}
& |u(a)-u(x_{n})|^{p}  \notag \\
\leq & 2^{p-1}|u(a)-u(x_{m})|^{p}+2^{p-1}\left( \sum_{k=n}^{m-1}\rho
^{\delta (k-n)q/p}\right) ^{p/q}\left( \sum_{k=n}^{m-1}\rho ^{\delta
(n-k)}|u(x_{k})-u(x_{k+1})|^{p}\right) ,  \label{203}
\end{align}%
where $q=p/(p-1)$. Integrating \eqref{203} with respect to $x_{k}\in
K_{w_{k}}$ and dividing by $\mu ^{F}(f(K_{w_{k}}))$,
\begin{align*}
E_{n}^{(p),F_{j}}(u)\leq & C_{1}\sum_{f\in F_{j}}\sum_{a\in f(V_{w}),|w|=n}%
\frac{2^{p-1}}{\mu ^{F}(f(K_{w_{m}}))}%
\int_{f(K_{w_{m}})}|u(a)-u(x_{m})|^{p}d\mu ^{F}(x_{m}) \\
& +C_{2}\sum_{f\in F_{j}}\sum_{k=n}^{m-1}\frac{\rho ^{\delta (n-k)}}{\mu
^{F}(f(K_{w_{k}}))\mu ^{F}(f(K_{w_{k+1}}))}\int_{f(K_{w_{k}})}%
\int_{f(K_{w_{k+1}})}|u(x_{k})-u(x_{k+1})|^{p}d\mu ^{F}(x_{k+1})d\mu
^{F}(x_{k}).
\end{align*}%
Using Lemma \ref{lemmaMR}, (\ref{BC}) and (\ref{v1}), the first term of the
right-hand side above vanishes as $m\rightarrow \infty $ since
\begin{align*}
& \sum_{a\in f(V_{w}),|w|=n}\frac{2^{p-1}}{\mu ^{F}(f(K_{w_{m}}))}%
\int_{f(K_{w_{m}})}|u(a)-u(x_{m})|^{p}d\mu ^{F}(x_{m}) \\
\leq & C|f(V_{n})|2^{p-1}\rho ^{(p\sigma -\alpha )m}[u]_{B_{p,\infty

-\alpha )m}[u]_{B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma ,F}}^{p} \\
\leq & C_{3}\rho ^{(p\sigma -\alpha )m-\alpha n}[u]_{B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma
,F}}^{p}\rightarrow 0.
\end{align*}%
Letting $m\rightarrow \infty $, we obtain
\begin{align}
E_{n}^{(p),F_{j}}(u)& \leq C_{4}\sum_{k=n}^{\infty }\rho ^{\delta (n-k)}\rho
^{-2\alpha k}\int_{K^{F}}\int_{B(x,\rho ^{k})}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}d\mu

& =C_{4}\sum_{k=n}^{\infty }\rho ^{\delta (n-k)}\rho ^{-2\alpha

k}\rho ^{-2\alpha (n+k)}\sum_{l=k}^{\infty }I_{l+n}^{F}(u)  \notag \\
& =C_{4}\sum_{l=0}^{\infty }\left( \sum_{k=0}^{l}\rho ^{-\delta k}\rho
^{-2\alpha (n+k)}\right) I_{l+n}^{F}(u)=C_{4}\sum_{l=0}^{\infty }\left(
\sum_{k=0}^{l}\rho ^{\delta (l-k)}\rho ^{2\alpha (l-k)}\right) \rho
^{-\delta l}\rho ^{-2\alpha (l+n)}I_{l+n}^{F}(u)  \notag \\
& \leq C_{5}\sum_{l=0}^{\infty }\rho ^{-\delta l}\rho ^{-2\alpha
(l+n)}I_{l+n}^{F}(u)=C_{5}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty }\rho ^{-\delta k}\rho
^{-2\alpha (k+n)}I_{k+n}^{F}(u).  \label{I_2}
\end{align}%
Letting $j\rightarrow \infty $, we have%

\mathcal{E}_{n}^{\sigma ,F}(u) &=&\rho ^{-(p\sigma -\alpha

&=&C_{5}\left( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty }\rho ^{(p\sigma -\alpha -\delta

1-\rho ^{p\sigma -\alpha -\delta }}\sup_{k\geq 0}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma ,F}(\rho
^{n+k}),
\end{eqnarray*}%
where the second inequality follows by enlarging each ring-energy $%
I_{k+n}^{F}$ to ball-energy.
\end{proof}

We need the following proposition to manage the transitions between
different levels of vertex energies.

\begin{proposition}
Let $K$ be a connected homogeneous p.c.f. self-similar set, then there
exists $C>0$ such that for all $u\in L^{p}(K,\mu )$ and nonnegative integer $n$,
\begin{equation*}
E_{n}^{(p)}(u)\leq CE_{n+1}^{(p)}(u).
\end{equation*}%
Moreover, there exists $C>0$ such that for all $u\in L^{p}(K^{F},\mu ^{F})$,
\begin{equation}
E_{n}^{(p),F}(u)\leq CE_{n+1}^{(p),F}(u).  \label{E-n}
\end{equation}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
We start with the basic case $n=0$. For any $x,y\in V_{0}$, we can fix a
vertex-disjoint path $x=z_{1}(x,y),z_{2}(x,y),\cdots ,z_{k}(x,y)=y$ such
that $z_{j}(x,y)$ and $z_{j+1}(x,y)$ ($1\leq j\leq k$) belong to the same $%
V_{w}$ for some $w\in W_{1}$, and $2\leq k\leq |V_{1}|$. Using Jensen's
inequality,
\begin{align*}
|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}& \leq
(k-1)^{p-1}\sum_{j=1}^{k-1}|u(z_{j}(x,y))-u(z_{j+1}(x,y))|^{p} \\
& \leq |V_{1}|^{p-1}\sum_{j=1}^{k-1}|u(z_{j}(x,y))-u(z_{j+1}(x,y))|^{p}.
\end{align*}%
It follows that
\begin{align*}
E_{0}^{(p)}(u)& \leq \sum_{x,y\in
V_{0}}|V_{1}|^{p-1}\sum_{j=1}^{k-1}|u(z_{j}(x,y))-u(z_{j+1}(x,y))|^{p} \\
& \leq |V_{0}|^{2}|V_{1}|^{p-1}\sum_{a,b\in V_{w},|w|=1}|u(a)-u(b)|^{p} \\
& =|V_{0}|^{2}|V_{1}|^{p-1}E_{1}^{(p)}(u),
\end{align*}%
since for each pair $(a,b)\in V_{w}$ with $|w|=1$, there exists at most one $%
j\in \{1,2,...k\}$ (depending on $(x,y)$) with $%
(z_{j}(x,y),z_{j+1}(x,y))=(a,b)$ for any $x,y\in V_{0}$. Thus, we show the
desired for $n=0$ with $C:=|V_{0}|^{2}|V_{1}|^{p-1}$ for any $u$. The rest
simply follows from that
\begin{align*}
E_{n}^{(p)}(u)& =\sum_{x,y\in
V_{w},|w|=n}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}=\sum_{|w|=n}E_{0}^{(p)}(u\circ \phi _{w}) \\
& \leq C\sum_{|w|=n}E_{1}^{(p)}(u\circ \phi _{w})=C\sum_{a,b\in
V_{wi},|w|=n,|i|=1}|u(a)-u(b)|^{p}=CE_{n+1}^{(p)}(u).
\end{align*}%
The second inclusion follows from the definition of $K^{F}$.
\end{proof}

In \cite[Theorem 1.4]{GaoYuZhang2022PA}, for a homogeneous p.c.f.
self-similar set $K$, we show the $p$-energy norm equivalence
\begin{equation}
\sup\limits_{n\geq 0}\rho ^{-n(p\sigma -\alpha )}E_{n}^{(p)}(u)\asymp
\lbrack u]_{B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma }(K)}^{p}\text{ \ (}p\sigma >\alpha \text{)%
},  \label{204}
\end{equation}%
where $E_{n}^{(p)}(u)$ is from (\ref{EE}).

Using Lemma \ref{lem6.2} and Lemma \ref{lem6.3}, we immediately derive such
equivalence for $K^{F}$. Define local $p$-energy norm for $K^{F}$ by
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{E}_{p,\infty }^{\sigma ,F}(u):=\sup\limits_{n\geq 0}\rho
^{-n(p\sigma -\alpha )}E_{n}^{(p),F}(u)=\sup_{n\geq 0}\mathcal{E}%
_{n}^{\sigma ,F}(u).
\end{equation*}

\begin{corollary}
\label{lem6.1} Let $K^{F}$ be a fractal glue-up. If $\sigma>\alpha /p$, then
for all $u\in B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma ,F}$,
\begin{equation}
\limsup_{n\rightarrow \infty }\mathcal{E}_{n}^{\sigma ,F}(u)\asymp
\limsup_{n\rightarrow \infty }\Phi _{u}^{\sigma ,F}(\rho ^{n}),\ \mathcal{E}%
_{p,\infty }^{\sigma ,F}(u)\asymp \lbrack u]_{B_{p,\infty}^{\sigma ,F}}^{p}.
\label{eq6.2}
\end{equation}
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
Taking limsup and sup (of $n$) on both sides of \eqref{eq6.3} and %
\eqref{eq6.4}, we have
\begin{eqnarray}
\limsup_{n\rightarrow \infty }\rho ^{-n(p\sigma +\alpha )}I_{\infty
,n}^{F}(u) &\leq &C\limsup_{n\rightarrow \infty }\mathcal{E}_{n}^{\sigma
,F}(u)\leq C^{\prime }\limsup_{n\rightarrow \infty }\Phi _{u}^{\sigma
,F}(\rho ^{n}),  \label{C6.1-1} \\
\sup\limits_{n\geq 0}\rho ^{-n(p\sigma +\alpha )}I_{\infty ,n}^{F}(u) &\leq
&C\sup\limits_{n\geq 0}\mathcal{E}_{n}^{\sigma ,F}(u).  \label{C6.1-2}
\end{eqnarray}

By (\ref{II-3}), we have%
\begin{equation*}
\limsup_{n\rightarrow \infty }\rho ^{-n(p\sigma +\alpha )}I_{\infty
,n}^{F}(u)\geq \rho ^{p\sigma +\alpha }C_{H}^{p\sigma +\alpha
}\limsup_{n\rightarrow \infty }\Phi _{u}^{\sigma ,F}(\rho ^{n}),
\end{equation*}%
thus showing
\begin{equation*}
\limsup_{n\rightarrow \infty }\mathcal{E}_{n}^{\sigma ,F}(u)\asymp
\limsup_{n\rightarrow \infty }\Phi _{u}^{\sigma ,F}(\rho ^{n})
\end{equation*}%
by (\ref{C6.1-1}). On the other hand, we have from (\ref{ct-1}) and (\ref{ct}%
) that
\begin{equation}
\sup\limits_{n\geq 0}\rho ^{-n(p\sigma +\alpha )}I_{\infty
,n}^{F}(u)=C_{H}^{p\sigma +\alpha }\sup\limits_{n\geq 0}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma
,F}(C_{H}\rho ^{n})=C_{H}^{p\sigma +\alpha }[u]_{B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma
,F}}^{p}  \label{C6.1-0}
\end{equation}

Since $C_{H}\in (0,1)$, assume that $\rho ^{s+1}\leq C_{H}<\rho ^{s}$ for
some nonnegative integer $s$. Replacing $n$ by $n+s+1$ in (\ref{eq6.4}), we
obtain%
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{E}_{n+s+1}^{\sigma ,F}(u)\leq C\sup_{k\geq 0}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma
,F}(\rho ^{n+s+1+k})\leq C^{\prime }\sup_{k\geq 0}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma
,F}(C_{H}\rho ^{n+k}).  \label{C6.1-3}
\end{equation}
By (\ref{E-n}),%
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{E}_{n+s+1}^{\sigma ,F}(u)=\rho ^{-(n+s+1)(p\sigma -\alpha
)}E_{n+s+1}^{(p),F}(u)\geq C^{-s-1}\rho ^{-(n+s+1)(p\sigma -\alpha
)}E_{n}^{(p),F}(u)=C^{-s-1}\rho ^{-(s+1)(p\sigma -\alpha )}\mathcal{E}%
_{n}^{\sigma ,F}(u),
\end{equation*}
thus by (\ref{C6.1-3}),
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{E}_{n}^{\sigma ,F}(u)\leq C^{\prime \prime }C_{H}^{p\sigma -\alpha
}\sup_{k\geq 0}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma ,F}(C_{H}\rho ^{n+k}).  \label{C6.1-4}
\end{equation}

We conclude from (\ref{C6.1-2}), (\ref{C6.1-0}) and (\ref{C6.1-4}) that%
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{E}_{p,\infty }^{\sigma ,F}(u)\asymp \lbrack u]_{B_{p,\infty
}^{\sigma ,F}}^{p}.
\end{equation*}

The proof is complete.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Property (E) holds for nested fractals}

\label{subsec5.2}For a set $V$, let $\ell (V)=\{u:$
$u$ maps $V$ into $\mathbb{R}\}$.

\begin{definition}
(\cite[Definition 3.1]{GaoYuZhang2022PA}) \label{dfE} We say that a
connected homogeneous p.c.f. self-similar set $K$ satisfies \textrm{property
(E)}, if there exist $\sigma>\alpha/p$ and a positive constant $C$ such that

\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)~] for any $u\in B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma}$ and for all $n\geq 0$, $%
\mathcal{E}_{0}^{\sigma}(u)\leq C\mathcal{E}_{n}^{\sigma}(u)$,

\item[(ii)] for any $u\in \ell (V_{0})$, there exists an extension $\tilde{u}%
\in B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma}$.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

In \cite[Remark 3.2]{GaoYuZhang2022PA} we know that under property (E), $%
\sigma=\sigma _{p}^{*}(K)$, and for all $n\geq m$, $\mathcal{E}_{m}^{\sigma
_{p}^{*}}(u)\leq C\mathcal{E}_{n}^{\sigma _{p}^{*}}(u)$.
The following proposition shows the importance of property (E).

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:critical} If a connected homogeneous p.c.f. self-similar set $K$
satisfies property (E), then
\begin{equation}
\sigma _{p}^{\ast }(K)=\sigma _{p}^{\#}(K)=\sigma _{p}^{\#}(K^{F}).
\label{qnmd}
\end{equation}%
Moreover, $K^{F}$ satisfies property (VE) with $\sigma _{p}^{\#}(K)$, and $%
B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma _{p}^{\#}(K),F}$ contains non-constant functions.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
The fact $\sigma _{p}^{\ast }(K)=\sigma _{p}^{\#}(K)$ follows from \cite[the
proof of Proposition 3.4]{GaoYuZhang2022PA}. It is also clear that $\sigma
_{p}^{\#}(K)\geq \sigma _{p}^{\#}(K^{F})$, since any non-constant function $%
u\in l(K^{F})$ in $B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma ,F}$ naturally gives a non-constant
function in $B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma }(K)$ for any $\sigma >0$: just restrict $%
u$ to a tile $f(K)$ where it is non-constant (for some $f\in F$).

For the reverse inclusion $\sigma _{p}^{\#}(K)\leq \sigma _{p}^{\#}(K^{F})$
to hold, we just need to use property (E)(ii) to find a non-constant
function in $B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma _{p}^{\#}(K),F}$. To see this, we pick a
contraction $f\in F$, and determine the values of $u$ on $f(V_{1})$ by $%
u(f(V_{0}))=0$ while $u(f(V_{1}\setminus V_{0}))=1$. We can then extend $u$
from $f(V_{1})$ to $f(K)$ and make sure that $u\circ f\in B_{p,\infty
}^{\sigma _{p}^{\#}(K)}$ by property (E)(ii), and simply define $u=0$
outside of $f(K)$ on $K^{F}$. Then $u$ is an extended non-trivial function
in $B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma _{p}^{\#}(K),F}$ since by (\ref{eq6.2}) and (\ref%
{204}),
\begin{equation*}
\lbrack u]_{B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma _{p}^{\#}(K),F}}^{p}\asymp \mathcal{E}%
_{p,\infty }^{\sigma _{p}^{\#}(K),F}(u)=\mathcal{E}_{p,\infty }^{\sigma
_{p}^{\#}(K)}(u\circ f)\asymp \lbrack u\circ f]_{B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma
_{p}^{\#}(K)}(K)}^{p}<\infty.
\end{equation*}
Thus we show \eqref{qnmd} and that $B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma _{p}^{\#}(K),F}$
contains non-constant functions.

Finally, since $K$ satisfies property (E), that is for all $n$,
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{E}_{n}^{\sigma _{p}^{\#}}(u)\leq C\liminf_{k\rightarrow \infty }%
\mathcal{E}_{k}^{\sigma _{p}^{\#}}(u),
\end{equation*}%
summing over $F$ gives that for all $n$,
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{E}_{n}^{\sigma _{p}^{\#},F}(u)\leq C\sum_{f\in
F}\liminf_{k\rightarrow \infty }\mathcal{E}_{k}^{\sigma _{p}^{\#}}(u\circ
f)\leq C\liminf_{k\rightarrow \infty }\sum_{f\in F}\mathcal{E}_{k}^{\sigma
_{p}^{\#}}(u\circ f)=C\liminf_{k\rightarrow \infty }\mathcal{E}_{k}^{\sigma
_{p}^{\#},F}(u),
\end{equation*}%
where we use Fatou's lemma to obtain the desired.
\end{proof}

When property (E) fails, $\sigma _{p}^{\#}=\sigma _{p}^{\ast }$ does not
always hold for connected homogeneous p.c.f. self-similar sets (see \cite%
{GuLau.2020.TAMS}). Moreover, we mention in passing that, the critical
domain $B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma _{p}^{\ast }}$ can be trivial for some metric
measure spaces (bounded or unbounded).

We present the following key lemma for {\em nested
fractals}, a class of connected homogeneous p.c.f. self-similar sets
defined in \cite{Kumagai.1993.PTaRF205} satisfying conditions $(A$-0$)\sim
(A $-3$)$ and $|V_{0}|\geq 2$ therein.

%\begin{definition}(\cite[Definition 4.1]{Caoqiugu2022adv})
%We say the condition $\left( \mathbf{A}\right)$ holds if There exists $E\in \mathcal{M}$ such that
%\begin{align}
%\inf_{n\geq0} \delta(\mathcal{T}^n E)=\frac{\min_{x\neq y}R(x,y)}{\max_{x\neq y}R(x,y)}>0
%\end{align}
%where $R(x,y)$ is the p-effective resistance
%(p-resistance for short) between $x, y$.
%\end{definition}
%
%
%
%\begin{lemma}(\cite[Theorem 4.2]{Caoqiugu2022adv})
%Let $1<p<\infty$ and $K$ be a p.c.f. self-similar set. Then there exists $E\in \mathcal{Q}$ and $\lambda> 0$ such that
%$\mathcal{T}E=\lambda E$ if and only if $\left( \mathbf{A}\right)$ holds. In particular, $\lambda$ is unique.
%
%In addition, if $K$ and $r$ are $\mathscr{G}$-symmetric, then we can also require that $E$ is $\mathscr{G}$-
%symmetric.
%\end{lemma}
%
%\begin{lemma}(\cite[(A')]{Caoqiugu2022adv})
%	We say the condition $\left( \mathbf{A^{\prime }}\right)$ holds if $\left( \mathbf{A}\right)$ holds and $r$ is properly chosen so that there is $E\in \mathcal{Q}$ such that $\mathcal{T}E=\lambda E$.
%\end{lemma}
%
%\begin{lemma}(\cite[lemma 5.4]{Caoqiugu2022adv})

%\end{lemma}
%
%
%
%\begin{lemma}(\cite[Theorem 6.3]{Caoqiugu2022adv})
%	Let $(K, {F_i}^N_{i=1})$ be an affine nested fractal. If the renormalization factor
%	$r$ is $\mathscr{G}$-symmetric, then condition $\left( \mathbf{A}\right)$ holds.
%\end{lemma}
%

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma:E}For a nested fractal, property (E) holds and $\sigma
_{p}^{\#}>\alpha/p$ for all $1<p<\infty$. \label{yyqx}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
In this proof we use the same terminology and notions as in \cite%
{Caoqiugu2022adv}. Let $K$ be a nested fractal. We fix the components $r_{i}$
of $\mathbf{r}$ in \cite[Theorem 6.3]{Caoqiugu2022adv} to be the same number
$r$, so it is `$\mathscr{G}$-symmetric' (see \cite[Section 3]%
{Caoqiugu2022adv} for definition). Then \cite[Theorem 6.3]{Caoqiugu2022adv}
states that, `condition $\left( \mathbf{A}\right) $' (see \cite[the
beginning of Section 4]{Caoqiugu2022adv} for definition) holds for affine
nested fractals (probably inhomogeneous), which includes $K$. By multiplying
$\mathbf{r}$ with a constant (still denoted by $\mathbf{r}$), \cite[Theorem
4.2]{Caoqiugu2022adv} guarantees that
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{T}E=E  \label{TE}
\end{equation}%
(see \cite[Definition 2.8, Definition 3.1]{Caoqiugu2022adv} for related
definitions), thus showing `condition $\left( \mathbf{A^{\prime }}\right) $'
(see \cite[the beginning of Section 5]{Caoqiugu2022adv}). So by \cite[Lemma
5.4]{Caoqiugu2022adv}, we can fix
\begin{equation}
r<1  \label{rp1}
\end{equation}%
to further satisfy condition $\left( \mathbf{A^{\prime }}\right) $ on $K$.

The equivalence of $E$ and $E_{0}^{(p)}$ (for functions $u\in l(V_{0})$, see
the statement of \cite[Theorem 5.1]{Caoqiugu2022adv}) is stated in the proof
of \cite[Proposition 5.3 (b)]{Caoqiugu2022adv}, which implies that
\begin{equation}
\Lambda ^{n}E(u)\asymp \Lambda ^{n}E_{0}^{(p)}(u)=r^{-n}E_{n}^{(p)}(u)
\label{205}
\end{equation}%
for all $n\geq 0$ and all functions $u\in l(V_{n})$ by the definition of $%
\Lambda $ in \cite[Definition 3.1]{Caoqiugu2022adv} and $E_{n}^{(p)}$ in our
paper.

Now fix
\begin{equation}
\sigma =\frac{\log _{\rho }r+\alpha }{p},  \label{s1}
\end{equation}%
so that $r=\rho ^{p\sigma -\alpha }$.

For property (E)(i), by the monotonicity property in \cite[Proposition
5.3 (a)]{Caoqiugu2022adv} and (\ref{205}),
\begin{equation}
E_{0}^{(p)}(u)\asymp E(u)\leq \Lambda E(u)\leq \cdots \leq \Lambda
^{n}E(u)\asymp r^{-n}E_{n}^{(p)}(u)=\rho ^{-n(p\sigma -\alpha
)}E_{n}^{(p)}(u)=\mathcal{E}_{n}^{\sigma}(u),  \label{EE-1}
\end{equation}%
so property (E)(i) holds with this $\sigma $.

Property (E)(ii) guarantees the existence of piecewise harmonic functions in
\cite[Section 5.1]{Caoqiugu2022adv}, which has a standard iterative
construction as in \cite{HermanPeironeStrichartz.2004.PA125} and Dirichlet
form theory. The iteration part is that, for any boundary value of a cell $%
u_{w}\in l(f_{w}(V_{0}))$, by (\ref{TE}), we can take its next-level
harmonic extension $\tilde{u}_{w}\in l(f_{w}(V_{1}))$ such that $\Lambda E(%
\tilde{u}_{w})=E(u_{w})$ and $\tilde{u}_{w}|_{f_{w}(V_{0})}=u_{w}$. The
iteration starts from $V_{0}$ to $V_{1}$, and from each level-1 cell to
level-2 cells in the above way, then finally to $V_{\ast }$. The p.c.f.
property is very crucial for the piecewise extension to be well-defined,
that is, to avoid different values for the same vertex (since the overlap of
same-level cells only occurs on the same-level scaling of $V_{0}$). Such an
extension satisfies the definition of piecewise harmonic functions in \cite[%
Section 5.1]{Caoqiugu2022adv}, so we know by \cite[Section 5.2]%
{Caoqiugu2022adv} that it naturally embeds into $C(K)$ and this gives an
extension to $K$ rather than $V_{\ast }$.

Therefore, we conclude from above that $K$ satisfies property (E) with $%
\sigma $ defined as in (\ref{s1}). By (\ref{qnmd}), we have $\sigma =\sigma
_{p}^{\#}$, thus
\begin{equation}
r=\rho ^{p\sigma -\alpha }=\rho ^{p\sigma _{p}^{\#}-\alpha }.  \label{rr}
\end{equation}
The inclusion $\sigma _{p}^{\#}>\alpha /p$ follows from \eqref{rp1}.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
This lemma also indicates the equivalence of heat kernel-based $p$-energy
norm $E_{p,\infty }^{\sigma _{p}^{\#}}(u)$, Besov norm $[u]_{B_{p,\infty
}^{\sigma _{p}^{\#}}}^{p}$ and the homogeneous discrete $p$-energy
constructed on a nested fractal $K$ by \cite[Theorem 5.1]{Caoqiugu2022adv}.
It is known by \cite[Theorem 8.18]{Barlow.1998.1} that $K$ admits a heat
kernel with estimates \eqref{hk_F}, so $p$-energy norm equivalence in Lemma %
\ref{thm1} holds. The critical exponents coincide $\sigma _{p}^{\#}(K)=\sigma
_{p}^{\ast }(K)$ due to property (E) using Proposition \ref{prop:critical}.
Using $\Lambda ^{n}E_{0}^{(p)}(u)\asymp \Lambda ^{n}E(u)$ in (\ref{205}),
the $p$-energy in \cite[Theorem 5.1]{Caoqiugu2022adv} with $r_{i}=r$ is
equivalent to $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty }\Lambda ^{n}E(u)$ (which exists by
\cite[Proposition 5.3]{Caoqiugu2022adv}), where $r=\rho ^{p\sigma
_{p}^{\#}(K)-\alpha }$ defined as in (\ref{rr}). By (\ref{204}) and (\ref{EE-1}),$$
[u]_{B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma _{p}^{\#}}}^{p}\asymp \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty }\Lambda ^{n}E(u).$$
This equivalence of the $p$-energy defined in \cite{HermanPeironeStrichartz.2004.PA125} on the Sierpi%
\'{n}ski gasket (a typical nested fractal) is already explained in \cite[Section 4]%
{GaoYuZhang2022PA}.

\subsection{Equivalence of properties (VE) and (NE)}

\label{subsec5.3} Our goal is to show the equivalence of properties (VE) and
(NE) on spaces $K^{F}$. For p.c.f. fractals, it is more direct to verify
property (VE) as Lemma \ref{yyqx} does, following the discretization routine of the $p$-energy
construction. Before we start our proofs, we mention
that it is quite different and more delicate to obtain the lower limit
equivalence, compared with the norm-equivalence (Lemma \ref{lem6.2} and
Corollary \ref{lem6.1}) using the upper limit. At a first glance, one needs
to be careful using the triangle inequality, since it is closely related to
`sup' rather than `inf'. In fact, we apply both Lemma \ref{lem6.2} and
Corollary \ref{lem6.1} to control each other in each single-side estimate
for the lower limit equivalence, with suitable truncation. The weak-monotonicity properties guarantee that one can truncate the infinite sums in the
two-sided estimates, so a lower bound can be obtained after we find the
relationship between finitely many terms after the
truncation.

\begin{lemma}
\label{thm_3} If a fractal glue-up $K^{F}$ satisfies $(\widetilde{VE})$ with
$\sigma >\alpha /p$, then there exists $C>0$ such that for all $u\in
B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma ,F}$,
\begin{equation}
\liminf_{n\rightarrow \infty }\mathcal{E}_{n}^{\sigma ,F}(u)\leq
C\liminf_{n\rightarrow \infty }\Phi _{u}^{\sigma ,F}(\rho ^{n}).
\label{limphi2}
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Since $C_{H}\in (0,1)$, assume that $\rho ^{s+1}\leq C_{H}<\rho ^{s}$ for
some $s\in \mathbb{N}$. For all $n>0$, we have by (\ref{II-2}) that%
\begin{equation}
I_{\infty ,n}^{F}(u)\geq \int_{K^{F}}\int_{B(x,\rho
^{n+s+1})}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p}d\mu ^{F}(y)d\mu ^{F}(x)\geq I_{n+s+1}^{F}(u).
\label{I-1}
\end{equation}

By the definition of $\limsup_{n\rightarrow \infty }\mathcal{E}_{k}^{\sigma
,F}(u)$, there exists a positive integer $n_{0}$ such that
\begin{equation*}
\sup_{k\geq n_{0}}\mathcal{E}_{k}^{\sigma ,F}(u)\leq 2\limsup_{n\rightarrow
\infty }\mathcal{E}_{n}^{\sigma ,F}(u).
\end{equation*}

Thus by (\ref{I-1}), we have for all $n\geq n_{0}+s+1$ that
\begin{eqnarray}
I_{n}^{F}(u) &\leq &I_{\infty ,n-s-1}^{F}(u)  \notag \\
&\leq &C\rho ^{(n-s-1)(p\sigma +\alpha )}\sup_{k\geq n-s-1}\mathcal{E}%
_{k}^{\sigma ,F}(u)\text{ \ \ (using \eqref{eq6.3})}  \notag \\
&\leq &CC_{H}^{-(p\sigma +\alpha )}\rho ^{n(p\sigma +\alpha )}\sup_{k\geq
n_{0}}\mathcal{E}_{k}^{\sigma ,F}(u)\leq 2CC_{H}^{-(p\sigma +\alpha )}\rho
^{n(p\sigma +\alpha )}\limsup_{n\rightarrow \infty }\mathcal{E}_{n}^{\sigma
,F}(u)  \notag \\
&\leq &C_{1}\rho ^{n(p\sigma +\alpha )}\liminf_{n\rightarrow \infty }%
\mathcal{E}_{n}^{\sigma ,F}(u)\text{ \ \ (by property }(\widetilde{VE})\text{%
)}.  \label{I_n}
\end{eqnarray}%
By Lemma \ref{lem6.3}, for any positive integer $L\geq
n_{0}+s+1 $ and $0<\delta <p\sigma -\alpha $,
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{E}_{n}^{\sigma ,F}(u)& \leq C_{2}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty }\rho
^{(-2\alpha -\delta )k}\rho ^{-(p\sigma +\alpha )n}I_{k+n}^{F}(u) \\
& = C_{2}\sum_{k=0}^{L}\rho ^{(-2\alpha -\delta )k}\rho ^{-(p\sigma +\alpha
)n}I_{k+n}^{F}(u)+C_{2}\sum_{k=L}^{\infty }\rho ^{(-2\alpha -\delta )k}\rho
^{-(p\sigma +\alpha )n}I_{k+n}^{F}(u) \\
& \leq C_{2}\sum_{k=0}^{L}\rho ^{(-2\alpha -\delta )k}\rho ^{-(p\sigma
+\alpha )n}I_{k+n}^{F}(u)+C_{1}C_{2}\sum_{k=L}^{\infty }\rho ^{(p\sigma
-\alpha -\delta )k}\liminf_{n\rightarrow \infty }\mathcal{E}_{n}^{\sigma
,F}(u), \\
& =C_{2}\left( \sum_{k=0}^{L}\rho ^{(-2\alpha -\delta )k}\rho ^{-(p\sigma
+\alpha )n}I_{k+n}^{F}(u)+\frac{C_{1}\rho ^{(p\sigma -\alpha -\delta )L}}{%
1-\rho ^{(p\sigma -\alpha -\delta )}}\liminf_{n\rightarrow \infty }\mathcal{E%
}_{n}^{\sigma ,F}(u)\right),
\end{align*}%
where we use \eqref{I_n} in the third line. Taking $\liminf_{n\rightarrow
\infty }$ in the right-hand side above, we have
\begin{equation*}
C_{3}\liminf_{n\rightarrow \infty }\mathcal{E}_{n}^{\sigma ,F}(u)\leq
\liminf_{n\rightarrow \infty }\sum_{k=0}^{L}\rho ^{-(2\alpha +\delta )k}\rho
^{-(p\sigma +\alpha )n}I_{k+n}^{F}(u),
\end{equation*}%
where $C_{3}:=\frac{1}{C_{2}}-\frac{C_{1}\rho ^{(p\sigma -\alpha -\delta )L}%
}{1-\rho ^{(p\sigma -\alpha -\delta )}}$.

Fix a large integer $L$ such that $C_{3}>0$, then
\begin{align*}
C_{3}\rho ^{(2\alpha +\delta )L}\liminf_{n\rightarrow \infty }\mathcal{E}%
_{n}^{\sigma ,F}(u)& \leq \rho ^{(2\alpha +\delta )L}\liminf_{n\rightarrow
\infty }\left( \sum_{k=0}^{L}\rho ^{-n(p\sigma +\alpha )}\rho ^{-(2\alpha
+\delta )k}I_{n+k}^{F}(u)\right) \\
& \leq \liminf_{n\rightarrow \infty }\rho ^{-n(p\sigma +\alpha
)}\sum_{k=0}^{L}I_{n+k}^{F}(u)\leq \liminf_{n\rightarrow \infty }\Phi
_{u}^{\sigma ,F}(\rho ^{n}),
\end{align*}%
thus showing \eqref{limphi2}.
\end{proof}

For the other side, we need certain control between different levels of
vertex-energies.

\begin{lemma}
\label{thm_4} If property $(\widetilde{NE})$ holds for a fractal glue-up $%
K^{F}$ with $\sigma >\alpha /p$, then there exists $C>0$ such that for all $%
u\in B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma ,F}$,
\begin{equation}
\liminf_{n\rightarrow \infty }\Phi _{u}^{\sigma ,F}(\rho ^{n})\leq
C\liminf_{n\rightarrow \infty }\mathcal{E}_{n}^{\sigma ,F}(u).
\label{limphi}
\end{equation}
% Moreover, we also have property $%(VE) $.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By \eqref{I_mn}, we have
\begin{align}
\rho ^{-n(p\sigma +\alpha )}I_{m,n}^{F}(u)\leq & C\rho ^{-n(p\sigma -\alpha
)}\sum_{k=n}^{m}\rho ^{k(p\sigma -\alpha )}\rho ^{-k(p\sigma -\alpha
)}E_{k}^{(p),F}(u)  \notag \\
\leq & C\sum_{k=n}^{m}\rho ^{(k-n)(p\sigma -\alpha )}\mathcal{E}_{k}^{\sigma
,F}(u)\leq C\sum_{k=0}^{\infty }\rho ^{k(p\sigma -\alpha )}\mathcal{E}%
_{k+n}^{\sigma ,F}(u).  \label{202}
\end{align}

By the definition of $\limsup_{n\rightarrow \infty }\mathcal{E}_{n}^{\sigma
,F}(u)$, there exists $n_{0}>0$ such that for all positive integer $L>n_{0}$%
,
\begin{eqnarray*}
\sup_{n\geq L}\mathcal{E}_{n}^{\sigma ,F}(u) &\leq &2\limsup_{n\rightarrow
\infty }\mathcal{E}_{n}^{\sigma ,F}(u) \\
&\asymp &\limsup_{n\rightarrow \infty }\Phi _{u}^{\sigma ,F}(\rho ^{n})\text{
\ (by Corollary \ref{lem6.1})} \\
&\leq &C\liminf_{n\rightarrow \infty }\Phi _{u}^{\sigma ,F}(\rho ^{n})\text{
\ \ (by property }(\widetilde{NE})\text{)}.
\end{eqnarray*}

It follows from (\ref{202}) that
\begin{eqnarray*}
\rho ^{-n(p\sigma +\alpha )}I_{m,n}^{F}(u) &\leq &C\sum_{k=0}^{\infty }\rho
^{k(p\sigma -\alpha )}\mathcal{E}_{k+n}^{\sigma ,F}(u) \\
&=&C\sum_{k=0}^{L}\rho ^{k(p\sigma -\alpha )}\mathcal{E}_{k+n}^{\sigma
,F}(u)+C\sum_{k=L+1}^{\infty }\rho ^{k(p\sigma -\alpha )}\mathcal{E}%
_{k+n}^{\sigma ,F}(u) \\
&\leq &C\sum_{k=0}^{L}\rho ^{k(p\sigma -\alpha )}\mathcal{E}_{k+n}^{\sigma
,F}(u)+C\sum_{k=L+1}^{\infty }\rho ^{k(p\sigma -\alpha )}\sup_{n\geq L}%
\mathcal{E}_{n}^{\sigma ,F}(u) \\
&\leq &C\sum_{k=0}^{L}\rho ^{k(p\sigma -\alpha )}\mathcal{E}_{k+n}^{\sigma
,F}(u)+C^{\prime }\sum_{k=L+1}^{\infty }\rho ^{k(p\sigma -\alpha
)}\liminf_{n\rightarrow \infty }\Phi _{u}^{\sigma ,F}(\rho ^{n}) \\
&=&C\sum_{k=0}^{L}\rho ^{k(p\sigma -\alpha )}\mathcal{E}_{k+n}^{\sigma
,F}(u)+C^{\prime }\frac{\rho ^{(p\sigma -\alpha )(L+1)}}{1-\rho ^{p\sigma
-\alpha }}\liminf_{n\rightarrow \infty }\Phi _{u}^{\sigma ,F}(\rho ^{n}).
\end{eqnarray*}

Using Lemma \ref{lem4.4}, we have
\begin{align*}
\rho ^{-n(p\sigma +\alpha )}I_{\infty ,n}^{F}(u)\leq & \rho ^{-n(p\sigma
+\alpha )}\liminf_{m\rightarrow \infty }I_{m,n}^{F}(u) \\
\leq & C\sum_{k=0}^{L}\rho ^{k(p\sigma -\alpha )}\mathcal{E}_{k+n}^{\sigma
,F}(u)+\frac{C^{\prime }\rho ^{(p\sigma -\alpha )(L+1)}}{1-\rho ^{p\sigma
-\alpha }}\liminf_{n\rightarrow \infty }\Phi _{u}^{\sigma ,F}(\rho ^{n}).
\end{align*}

Combining this and (\ref{II-1}), we have%
\begin{equation*}
\rho ^{p\sigma +\alpha }C_{H}^{p\sigma +\alpha }\liminf_{n\rightarrow \infty
}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma ,F}(\rho ^{n})\leq C\liminf_{n\rightarrow \infty
}\sum_{k=0}^{L}\rho ^{k(p\sigma -\alpha )}\mathcal{E}_{k+n}^{\sigma ,F}(u)+%
\frac{C^{\prime }\rho ^{(p\sigma -\alpha )(L+1)}}{1-\rho ^{p\sigma -\alpha }}%
\liminf_{n\rightarrow \infty }\Phi _{u}^{\sigma ,F}(\rho ^{n}).
\end{equation*}

For sufficiently large $L$ ($>n_{0}$), we have
\begin{equation*}
C^{\prime \prime }:=\frac{1}{C}\left( \rho ^{p\sigma +\alpha }C_{H}^{p\sigma
+\alpha }-\frac{C^{\prime }\rho ^{(p\sigma -\alpha )(L+1)}}{1-\rho ^{p\sigma
-\alpha }}\right) >0.
\end{equation*}

Then for this $L$, we obtain
\begin{align}
C^{\prime \prime }\liminf_{n\rightarrow \infty }\Phi _{u}^{\sigma ,F}(\rho
^{n})& \leq \liminf_{n\rightarrow \infty }\sum_{k=0}^{L}\rho ^{k(p\sigma
-\alpha )}\mathcal{E}_{k+n}^{\sigma ,F}(u)  \notag \\
& =\liminf_{n\rightarrow \infty }\sum_{k=0}^{L}\rho ^{k(p\sigma -\alpha
)}\rho ^{-(k+n)(p\sigma -\alpha )}E_{k+n}^{(p),F}(u)  \notag \\
& =\liminf_{n\rightarrow \infty }\sum_{k=0}^{L}\rho ^{-n(p\sigma -\alpha
)}E_{k+n}^{(p),F}(u).  \label{E_kn}
\end{align}

Using \eqref{E-n}, there exists $c>0$ such that for all positive integer $n$
and $u\in B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma ,F}$,%
\begin{equation*}
E_{n}^{(p),F}(u)\leq cE_{n+1}^{(p),F}(u).
\end{equation*}
Applying the above inequality to \eqref{E_kn}, we have
\begin{align*}
C^{\prime \prime }\liminf_{n\rightarrow \infty }\Phi _{u}^{\sigma ,F}(\rho
^{n})& \leq \liminf_{n\rightarrow \infty }C_{L}\ \rho ^{-(n+L)(p\sigma
-\alpha )}E_{n+L}^{(p),F}(u) \\
& =C_{L}\liminf_{n\rightarrow \infty }\mathcal{E}_{n+L}^{(p),F}(u)=C_{L}%
\liminf_{n\rightarrow \infty }\mathcal{E}_{n}^{(p),F}(u),
\end{align*}%
where $C_{L}=\frac{1-c^{L}}{1-c}\rho ^{L(p\sigma -\alpha )}$ does not depend
on $n$, which proves \eqref{limphi}.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \protect\ref{thm5}]
By \eqref{eq6.2}, \eqref{limphi2} and (\ref{ne}), $(\widetilde{VE})$ with $%
\sigma >\alpha /p$ implies $(\widetilde{NE})$ since
\begin{equation}
\limsup_{r\rightarrow 0}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma ,F}(r) \leq C\limsup_{n\rightarrow
\infty }\mathcal{E}_{n}^{\sigma ,F}(u)\leq C^{\prime }\liminf_{n\rightarrow
\infty }\mathcal{E}_{n}^{\sigma ,F}(u)\leq C^{\prime \prime
}\liminf_{r\rightarrow 0}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma ,F}(r).  \label{ve_ne1}
\end{equation}%
By \eqref{eq6.2}, (\ref{ne}) and \eqref{limphi}, $(\widetilde{NE})$ with $%
\sigma >\alpha /p$ implies $(\widetilde{VE})$ since
\begin{equation}
\limsup_{n\rightarrow \infty }\mathcal{E}_{n}^{\sigma ,F}(u)\leq
C_{1}\limsup_{r\rightarrow 0}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma ,F}(r)\leq C_{1}^{\prime
}\liminf_{r\rightarrow 0}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma ,F}(r)\leq C_{1}^{\prime \prime
}\liminf_{n\rightarrow \infty }\mathcal{E}_{n}^{\sigma ,F}(u).
\label{ne_ve1}
\end{equation}%
Thus, by \eqref{ve_ne1} and \eqref{ne_ve1}, we show Theorem \ref{thm5} (i).

By \eqref{eq6.2} and \eqref{limphi2} adjoint with $(VE)\Rightarrow (%
\widetilde{VE})$, we immediately have from (\ref{ns}), (\ref{ne}) that
\begin{equation}
\sup_{r\in (0,C_H)}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma ,F}(r)\leq C_{2}\sup_{n\geq 0 }\mathcal{%
E}_{n}^{\sigma ,F}(u)\leq C_{2}^{\prime }\liminf_{n\rightarrow \infty }%
\mathcal{E}_{n}^{\sigma ,F}(u)\leq C_{2}^{\prime \prime
}\liminf_{r\rightarrow 0}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma ,F}(r).  \label{ve_ne2}
\end{equation}%
Similarly, by \eqref{eq6.2} and \eqref{limphi} adjoint with the fact $%
(NE)\Rightarrow (\widetilde{NE})$, we immediately have
\begin{equation}
\sup_{n\geq 0}\mathcal{E}_{n}^{\sigma ,F}(u)\leq C_{3}\sup_{n\geq 0}\Phi
_{u}^{\sigma ,F}(C_H\rho ^{n})\leq C_{3}^{\prime }\liminf_{n\rightarrow
\infty }\Phi _{u}^{\sigma ,F}(\rho ^{n})\leq C_{3}^{\prime \prime
}\liminf_{n\rightarrow \infty }\mathcal{E}_{n}^{\sigma ,F}(u).
\label{ne_ve2}
\end{equation}%
Thus, by \eqref{ve_ne2} and \eqref{ne_ve2}, we show Theorem \ref{thm5} (ii).
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
The definition of discrete energies in \eqref{p_energy} uses point-wise values of functions as opposed to cell-averaged values considered in \cite{Kigami2022penergy,KS92}.
When $p\sigma >\alpha$, the domain of p-energy $\mathcal{E}_{p,\infty}^{\sigma,F}$ is a subset of $C(K^F)$, and both definitions are equivalent for a connected homogeneous p.c.f. self-similar set by modifying the arguments in \cite[Lemma 3.1]{HK06} and
\cite[Section 5]{Shimuzu.2022}. We will also study the relation between the weak-monotonicity of cell-averaged discrete norms and our weak-monotonicity properties in an upcoming work.
\end{remark}



\subsection{Consequences of (VE): BBM type characterization and
Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality}

\label{subsec5.4} Let us state the following embedding
inequality given by Baudoin, using our notions.

\begin{lemma}
\label{GNTM}(\cite[Theorem 4.3]{BaudoinLecture2022}) Suppose that property
(NE) holds with $R_0=\infty$ for the metric measure space $(M,d,\mu )$, and
there exists $R>0$ such that $\inf_{x\in M}\mu (B(x,R))>0$. When $p\sigma
_{p}^{\#}\neq \alpha_1 $, where $\alpha_1$ is from (\ref{VD2}), let $q=\frac{%
p\alpha_1 }{\alpha_1 -p\sigma_{p}^{\#}}$. For $r,s\in (0,\infty ]$, $\theta
\in (0,1]$ satisfying
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{r}=\frac{\theta }{q}+\frac{1-\theta }{s},
\end{equation*}%
there exists a constant $C>0$ such that for any $f\in B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma
_{p}^{\#}}$,
\begin{equation}
\Vert f\Vert _{r}\leq C(\Vert f\Vert _{p}+[f]_{B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma
_{p}^{\#}}})^{\theta }\Vert f\Vert _{s}^{1-\theta }.  \label{GNI}
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}

By Theorem \ref{thm4} and Theorem \ref{thm5}, we have the following
corollary.

\begin{corollary}
\label{corol1.8}Suppose that $K^{F}$ is a fractal glue-up that admits a heat
kernel satisfying \eqref{hk_F}, where $K$ is a connected homogeneous p.c.f.
self-similar set. Let $R_0=C_H$. Then properties $(\widetilde{KE}),(%
\widetilde{NE}),(\widetilde{VE})$ are equivalent with the same $%
\sigma>\alpha /p$, and properties $(KE),(NE),(VE)$ are equivalent when $%
\sigma_{p}^{\#}>\alpha /p$ on $K^{F}$.
\end{corollary}

The following theorem can be regarded as a summary of our paper in the context of fractal spaces.

\begin{theorem}
\label{corol1.9}Let $K^{F}$ be a fractal glue-up, where $K$ is a connected
homogeneous p.c.f. self-similar set satisfying property (E). Then $K^{F}$
satisfies (NE) with $R_{0}=C_H$ and $B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma
_{p}^{\#}(K^{F})}(K^{F}):=B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma _{p}^{\#}}(K^{F})$ contains
non-constant functions. Also, the BBM type characterization (%
\ref{NE_conv}) holds for $K^{F}$ with $R_{0}=C_H$, that is, for $R_{0}=C_H$,
there exists a positive constant $C$ such that for all $u\in B_{p,\infty
}^{\sigma _{p}^{\#}}(K^{F})$,
\begin{equation}
C^{-1}[u]_{{B}_{p,\infty }^{\sigma _{p}^{\#}}(K^{F})}^{p}\leq
\liminf_{\sigma \uparrow \sigma _{p}^{\#}(K^{F})}\left( \sigma
_{p}^{\#}(K^{F})-\sigma \right) [u]_{{B}_{p,p}^{\sigma }(K^{F})}^{p}\leq
\limsup_{\sigma \uparrow \sigma _{p}^{\#}(K^{F})}\left( \sigma
_{p}^{\#}(K^{F})-\sigma \right) [u]_{{B}_{p,p}^{\sigma }(K^{F})}^{p}\leq
C[u]_{{B}_{p,\infty }^{\sigma _{p}^{\#}}(K^{F})}^{p}.  \label{SS-2}
\end{equation}%
Furthermore, if $K$ is a nested fractal and $K^{F}=K_{\infty }$, where $%
K_{\infty }$ is defined in Example \ref{ex1}, then (NE) and (KE) are
satisfied with $R_{0}=\infty $, and the Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality (\ref%
{GNI}) holds true.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
By Proposition \ref{prop:critical}, $K^{F}$ satisfies (VE) and the critical domain $B_{p,\infty
}^{\sigma _{p}^{\#}}(K^{F})$ contains
non-constant functions, where $\sigma _{p}^{\#}=\sigma _{p}^{\#}(K)=\sigma
_{p}^{\#}(K^{F})$. Thus (NE) holds true for $K^{F}$
by Theorem \ref{thm5} with $R_{0}=C_H$, then (\ref{SS-2}) holds by Lemma \ref%
{thm4.2}.

Since a nested fractal $K$ satisfies property (E) by Lemma \ref%
{lemma:E}, these inclusions hold for nested fractals. Next, we state how to upgrade $R_0=C_H$
to $R_0=\infty $ for (NE) on $K_{\infty }$.

For any $n\in \mathbb{N}$, define the scaling function $g_{n}:K^{F}%
\rightarrow \rho ^{-n}K^{F}$ by $g_{n}(x)=\rho ^{-n}x.$ Due to the global
self-similarity of $K_{\infty }$, we have
\begin{equation}
g_{n}(K_{\infty })=K_{\infty }.  \label{ss}
\end{equation}
For any $u\in B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma ,F}$, clearly $u\circ g_{n}\in
B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma ,F}$. By definition, for all $r>0$ and all
$u\in B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma ,F}$,
\begin{eqnarray}
\Phi _{u\circ g_{n}}^{\sigma ,F}(\rho ^{n}r) &=&(\rho ^{n}r)^{-p\sigma
-\alpha }\int_{K_{\infty }}\int_{B(x,\rho
^{n}r)}|u(g_{n}(x))-u(g_{n}(y))|d\mu ^{F}(y)d\mu ^{F}(x)  \notag \\
&=&(\rho ^{n}r)^{-p\sigma -\alpha }\int_{K_{\infty
}}\int_{B(g_{n}(x),r)}|u(g_{n}(x))-u(y)|d(\mu ^{F}\circ g_{n}^{-1})(y)d\mu
^{F}(x)  \notag \\
&=&(\rho ^{n}r)^{-p\sigma -\alpha }\int_{g_{n}(K_{\infty
})}\int_{B(x,r)}|u(x)-u(y)|d\mu ^{F}(\rho ^{n}y)d\mu ^{F}(\rho ^{n}x)  \notag
\\
&\asymp &(\rho ^{n}r)^{-p\sigma -\alpha }\rho ^{2n\alpha }\int_{K_{\infty
}}\int_{B(x,r)}|u(x)-u(y)|d\mu ^{F}(y)d\mu ^{F}(x)\   \notag \\
&=&\rho ^{-n(p\sigma -\alpha )}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma ,F}(r),  \label{sp}
\end{eqnarray}%
where we use (\ref{ss}) and that $\mu ^{F}$ is $\alpha $-regular in the forth
line. For any $u\in B_{p,\infty }^{\sigma ,F}$, there exists $n<\infty $
such that
\begin{equation*}
\sup_{r\in (0,\infty )}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma ,F}(r)\leq 2\sup_{r\in (0,C_{H}\rho
^{-n})}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma ,F}(r).
\end{equation*}%
Combined with (\ref{sp}),
\begin{equation}
\sup_{r\in (0,\infty )}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma ,F}(r)\leq C\sup_{r^{\prime }\in
(0,C_{H})}\Phi _{u\circ g_{n}}^{\sigma ,F}(r^{\prime })\rho ^{n(p\sigma
-\alpha )}.  \label{sp-1}
\end{equation}%
As (NE) holds for $R_{0}=C_{H}$,
\begin{eqnarray*}
\sup_{r^{\prime }\in (0,C_{H})}\Phi _{u\circ g_{n}}^{\sigma
_{p}^{\#},F}(r^{\prime })\rho ^{n(p\sigma _{p}^{\#}-\alpha )} &\leq
&C\liminf_{r^{\prime }\rightarrow 0}\Phi _{u\circ g_{n}}^{\sigma
_{p}^{\#},F}(r^{\prime })\rho ^{n(p\sigma _{p}^{\#}-\alpha )} \\
&=&C\liminf_{r^{\prime }\rightarrow 0}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma _{p}^{\#},F}(\rho
^{-n}r^{\prime })\text{ \ (by (\ref{sp}))} \\
&=&C\liminf_{r\rightarrow 0}\Phi _{u}^{\sigma _{p}^{\#},F}(r),\text{ }
\end{eqnarray*}%
where the constant $C$ does not depend on $u,n$. Thus (NE) also
holds with $R_{0}=\infty $ by (\ref{sp-1}). Since $p\sigma _{p}^{\#}>\alpha $
and that $\mu ^{F}$ is $\alpha $-regular, we
know by Lemmas \ref{lemma:E} and \ref{GNTM} that (\ref{GNI}) holds true. Finally, for a nested fractal $K$, it is known by \cite{Kumagai.1993.PTaRF205} (see also \cite[%
Theorem 1.1]{FitzsimmonsmHamblyKumagai.1994.CMP595}) that $%
K_{\infty }$ admits a heat kernel satisfying \eqref{hk_F}, thus (KE) is verified by Theorem \ref{thm4}. The proof is complete.
\end{proof}

When $p=2$, we use heat kernel estimates to verify weak-monotonicity properties in the
following corollary, which is analytical (compared with the
algebraic resistance-estimate arguments for (VE)).

\begin{corollary}
\label{jjj} When $p=2$, if a fractal glue-up $K^{F}$ admits a heat kernel with two-sided
estimates \eqref{hk_F}, then (VE) and (NE) automatically hold for $K^F $.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
By Remark \ref{rk1}, property (KE) automatically holds for $K^F$ when $p=2$.
The conclusion then follows from Corollary \ref{corol1.8}.
\end{proof}

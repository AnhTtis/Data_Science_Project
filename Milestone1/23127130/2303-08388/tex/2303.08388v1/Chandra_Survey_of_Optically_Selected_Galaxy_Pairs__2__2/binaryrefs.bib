	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {We measure the bivariate luminosity function (BLF) of galaxy pairs and use it to probe and characterize the galaxy–galaxy interaction between pair members. The galaxy pair sample is selected from the main galaxy sample of Sloan Digital Sky Survey and supplied with a significant number of redshifts from the LAMOST spectral and GAMA surveys. We find the BLFs depend on the projected distance dp between pair members. At large separation dp > 150 h−1 kpc, the BLF degenerates into a luminosity function of single galaxies, indicating few interactions between pair members. At 100 h−1 kpc ≤ dp ≤ 150 h−1 kpc, the BLF starts to show a correlation between pair members, in the sense that the shape of the conditional luminosity function (CLF) of one member galaxy starts to depend on the luminosity of the other member galaxy. Specifically, the CLF with a brighter companion has a steeper faint-end slope, which becomes even more significant at 50 h−1 kpc ≤ dp ≤ 100 h−1 kpc. This behavior is consistent with the scenario—and also is the observational evidence—that dynamic friction drives massive major merger pairs to merge more quickly. At close distance dp ≤ 50 h−1 kpc, aside from the merging timescale effect, the BLF also shows an overall brightening of ΔMr ≥ 0.04 mag, which reveals the enhanced star formation of the close-pair phase. By combining this with the statistical conclusion that the star formation rate of late-type galaxies in close pairs is enhanced at a level of about 40%, we further conclude that the average starburst timescale of close pairs is as long as 0.4 Gyr.}

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {Galaxy–galaxy mergers and close interactions have long been regarded as a viable mechanism for channeling gas toward the central supermassive black holes (SMBHs) of galaxies which are triggered as active galactic nuclei (AGNs). AGN pairs, in which the central SMBHs of a galaxy merger are both active, are expected to be common from such events. We conduct a systematic study of 1286 AGN pairs at with line-of-sight velocity offsets Δv < 600 km s−1 and projected separations rp < 100 h−170 kpc, selected from the Seventh Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). This AGN pair sample was drawn from 138,070 AGNs optically identified based on diagnostic emission line ratios and/or line widths. The fraction of AGN pairs with 5 h−170 kpc ≲ rp < 100 h−170 kpc among all spectroscopically selected AGNs at 0.02 < z < 0.16 is 3.6% after correcting for SDSS spectroscopic incompleteness; ∼30% of these pairs show morphological tidal features in their SDSS images, and the fraction becomes ≳ 80% for pairs with the brightest nuclei. Our sample increases the number of known AGN pairs on these scales by more than an order of magnitude. We study their AGN and host-galaxy star formation properties in a companion paper.}

    "abstract": "We report crystal structure and magnetic behavior of the triangular antiferromagnet KYbO$_2$, the A-site substituted version of the quantum spin liquid candidate NaYbO$_2$. The replacement of Na by K introduces an anisotropic tensile strain with 1.6% in-plane and 12.1% out-of-plane lattice expansion. Compared to NaYbO$_2$, both Curie-Weiss temperature and saturation field are reduced by about 20% as the result of the increased Yb--O--Yb angles, whereas the $g$-tensor of Yb$^{3+}$ becomes isotropic with $g=3.08(3)$. Field-dependent magnetization shows the plateau at 1/2 of the saturated value and suggests the formation of the up-up-up-down field-induced order in the triangular AYbO$_2$ oxides (A = alkali metal), in contrast to the isostructural selenides that exhibit the 1/3 plateau and the up-up-down field-induced order.",

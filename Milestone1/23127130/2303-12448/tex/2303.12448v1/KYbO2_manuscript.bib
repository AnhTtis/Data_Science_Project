In this brief review, we juxtapose recent theoretical developments that trace the parameter regime of the spin-liquid phase, with experimental results for Co-based and Yb-based triangular antiferromagnets. Unconventional spin dynamics arising from both ordered and disordered ground states are discussed, and the notion of a geometrically perfect triangular system is scrutinized to demonstrate non-trivial imperfections that may assist magnetic frustration in stabilizing dynamic spin states with peculiar excitations.}

All of the KLnO2 compounds have the same hexagonal α-NaFeO2 structure with space group R3¯m. Magnetic susceptibility measurements for these compounds show paramagnetic behavior down to 1.8K. The specific heat measurements indicate that the Gd, Dy, Ho and Er compounds have a magnetic anomaly at 1.1, 1.8, 1.2 and 0.8K, respectively.

Very clear spectra with a well-resolved and large anisotropy could be observed down to the lowest accessible temperature of 2.7 K. In contrast to the ESR properties of other known spin-liquid candidate systems, the resonance seen in NaYbS2 is accessible at low fields (<1 T) and is narrow enough for accurate characterisation of the relaxation rate as well as the g factor of the Yb3+ spins.}

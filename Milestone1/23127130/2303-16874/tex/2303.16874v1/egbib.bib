% network to predict the 2D projections of the corners of the 3D bounding box around our objects.  The main insight was that YOLO was originally designed to regress 2D bounding boxes and to predict the projections of the 3D bounding box corners in the image, a few more 2D points had to be predicted for each object instance in the image.
% BB8 [26] takes a similar approach. However, they first find a 2D segmentation mask around the object and present a cropped image to a second network that predicts the eight 2D corners in the image. 
% The 3D output tensor from our network, which represents for each **cell** a vector consisting of the 2D corner locations, the class probabilities and a confidence value associated with the prediction.

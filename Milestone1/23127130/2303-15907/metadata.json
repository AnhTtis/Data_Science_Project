    "abstract": "We show that finitely generated fundamental groups of three-manifolds satisfy the Strong Atiyah Conjecture over the complex numbers. This implies that when the group is additionally torsion-free, then its complex group ring satisfies the Kaplansky Zero-divisor Conjecture.\n  As an application, we give a very short proof of a significant generalisation of a recent result of Shalen dealing with the minimal index of freedom of three-manifold groups.",

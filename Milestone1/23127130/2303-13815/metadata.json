    "abstract": "It is well known that the ring radical theory can be approached via language of modules. In this work, we present some generalizations of classical results from module theory, in the two-sided sense. We proved that if $\\mathsf{M}$ is a finitely generated $\\mathsf{G}$-graded $\\mathfrak{A}$-bimodule, where $\\mathsf{G}$ is an abelian group, $\\mathfrak{A}$ is a finite dimensional simple $\\mathsf{G}$-graded associative $\\mathbb{F}$-algebra, and $\\mathbb{F}$ is an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, then there exist nonzero homogeneous elements $w_1, w_2,\\dots,w_n\\in\\mathsf{M}$ such that\n  \\begin{equation}\\nonumber \\mathsf{M}=\\mathfrak{A} w_1\\oplus\\mathfrak{A} w_2\\oplus \\cdots \\oplus \\mathfrak{A} w_n \\ ,\n  \\end{equation} where $w_i \\mathfrak{A}=\\mathfrak{A} w_i\\neq0$ for all $i=1, 2,\\dots,n$, and each $\\mathfrak{A} w_i$ is irreducible. The elements $w_i$'s are associated to the irreducible characters of $\\mathsf{G}$. We also describe graded bimodules over graded semisimple algebras. And we finish by presenting a Pierce decomposition of the graded Jacobson radical of any finite dimensional $\\mathbb{F}$-algebra with a $\\mathsf{G}$-grading.",

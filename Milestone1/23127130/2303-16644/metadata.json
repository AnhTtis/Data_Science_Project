    "abstract": "We analyze the management of the Italian pandemic during the five identified waves. We considered the following problems: (i) The composition of the CTS (\"Scientific Technical Committee\"), which was composed entirely of doctors, mainly virologists, without mathematical epidemiologists, statisticians, physicists, etc. In fact, a pandemic has a behavior described by mathematical, stochastic and probabilistic criteria; (ii) Political interference in security measures and media propaganda; (iii) The initial stages of the vaccination campaign, ignoring the age factor, and (iv) The persistence of the pandemic due to the population unvaccinated (anti-vax or \"no-vax\"), which amounts to about six to seven million people, including 10% of anti-vax doctors.",

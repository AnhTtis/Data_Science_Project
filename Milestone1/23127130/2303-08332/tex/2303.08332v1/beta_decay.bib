abstract = {New ab initio calculations of the isotopic reactor antineutrino fluxes are provided with exact numerical calculations of the lepton wave functions, assuming all the decay branches are allowed GT transitions. We illustrate that the analytical Fermi function and finite size effect each could have the largest spectral deviation of O(10%), whereas the effect of their combination could result in spectral deviations at the level of 5%—10%. Meanwhile, we also find that several forms of the extended charge distributions have negligible effects on the spectral variation. Using the state-of-the-art nuclear databases, compared to usual ab initio calculations using the analytical single beta decay spectrum, our new calculation shows sizable but opposite spectral deviations at the level of 2%—4% for the cumulative antineutrino and electron energy spectra which may partially contribute to the observed spectral excess in the high energy antineutrino range. Finally we observe that the bias of analytical beta decay spectrum approximation is rather universal for all the four fissionable isotopes.}

	abstract = {A precise description of neutrino-nucleus reactions will play a key role in addressing fundamental questions such as the leptonic CP violation and the neutrino mass hierarchy through analyzing data from next-generation neutrino oscillation experiments. The neutrino energy relevant to the neutrino-nucleus reactions spans a broad range and, accordingly, the dominant reaction mechanism varies across the energy region from quasi-elastic scattering through nucleon resonance excitations to deep inelastic scattering. This corresponds to transitions of the effective degree of freedom for theoretical description from nucleons through meson-baryon to quarks. The main purpose of this review is to report our recent efforts towards a unified description of the neutrino-nucleus reactions over the wide energy range; recent overall progress in the field is also sketched. Starting with an overview of the current status of neutrino-nucleus scattering experiments, we formulate the cross section to be commonly used for the reactions over all the energy regions. A description of the neutrino-nucleon reactions follows and, in particular, a dynamical coupled-channels model for meson productions in and beyond the (1232) region is discussed in detail. We then discuss the neutrino-nucleus reactions, putting emphasis on our theoretical approaches. We start the discussion with electroweak processes in few-nucleon systems studied with the correlated Gaussian method. Then we describe quasi-elastic scattering with nuclear spectral functions, and meson productions with a -hole model. Nuclear modifications of the parton distribution functions determined through a global analysis are also discussed. Finally, we discuss issues to be addressed for future developments.}

The main purpose is to study the strong quenching of the unique (ΔJ = 2) decays, which results from the repulsive nature of the T = 1 particle-hole interaction, and the strong meson-exchange enhancement of the ΔJ = 0 decays. Procedures for calculating the relevant matrix elements and combining them to form the decay rate are described in detail. Varous approximations designed to display more clearly the dependence of the rates on the contributing matrix elements are presented and the associated errors assessed. The results are compared to experiment and conclusions are drawn regarding our present understanding of first-forbidden beta decays."

abstract = {Major astrophysical applications involve a huge number of exotic nuclei. Their beta-decay properties play a crucial role in stellar explosive events. An important effort has been developed in last decades to measure the masses and β-decay properties of very neutron-rich nuclei at radioactive nuclear beam facilities. However, most of them cannot be synthesized in terrestrial laboratories and only theoretical predictions can fill the gap. We will concentrate mainly on the β-decay rates needed for stellar r-process modeling and for performing the RNB experiments. An overview of the microscopic approaches to the β-decay strength function is given. The continuum QRPA approach based on the self-consistent ground state description in the framework of the density functional theory is outlined. For the first time, a systematic study of the total β-decay half-lives and delayed neutron emission probabilities takes into account the Gamow\UTF{2013}Teller and first-forbidden transitions. Due to the shell configuration effects, the first-forbidden decays have a strong impact on the β-decay characteristics of the r-process relevant nuclei at Z\UTF{2248}28, N>50; Z\UTF{2A7E}50, N>82 and Z=60\UTF{2013}70, N\UTF{2248}126. Suppression of the delayed neutron emission probability is found in nuclei with the neutron excess bigger than one major shell. The effect originates from the high-energy first-forbidden transitions to the states outside the (Qβ−Bn)-window in the daughter nuclei. The performance of existing global models for the nuclides near the r-process paths is critically analyzed and confronted with the recent RIB experiments in the regions of 78Ni, 132Sn and “east” of 208Pb.}

abstract = "We consider the Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov theory of nuclei in the coordinate representation and derive and solve the HFB equation for the Skyrme effective interaction. Ground-state wave functions and energies of the tin isotopes with 100 \UTF{2A7D} A \UTF{2A7D} 176 have been determined and the results have been compared with the predictions of the HF+BCS and macroscopic-microscopic models. The lightest tin isotope which is unstable with respect to a neutron emission is predicted by the HFB method to be 153Sn. In the region of nuclei where experimental data are not available the macroscopic-microscopic and self-consistent approximations give substantially different results."

In this paper, these forces are specifically adjusted to reproduce finite nuclei properties. Spin-orbit terms and center of mass correlations are analyzed. New Skyrme parametrizations are proposed and some of their spectroscopic properties are presented, e.g. S2n, S2p and r.m.s. radii for different isotopic and isotonic series."

abstract={Skin effect, experimentally discovered in one dimension, describes the physical phenomenon that on an open chain, an extensive number of eigenstates of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian are localized at the end(s) of the chain. Here in two and higher dimensions, we establish a theorem that the skin effect exists, if and only if periodic-boundary spectrum of the Hamiltonian covers a finite area on the complex plane. This theorem establishes the universality of the effect, because the above condition is satisfied in almost every generic non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, and, unlike in one dimension, is compatible with all point-group symmetries. We propose two new types of skin effect in two and higher dimensions: the corner-skin effect where all eigenstates are localized at corners of the system, and the geometry-dependent-skin effect where skin modes disappear for systems of a particular shape, but appear on generic polygons. An immediate corollary of our theorem is that any non-Hermitian system having exceptional points (lines) in two (three) dimensions exhibits skin effect, making this phenomenon accessible to experiments in photonic crystals, Weyl semimetals, and Kondo insulators.},

abstract={Topological phases are enriched in non-equilibrium open systems effectively described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. While several properties unique to non-Hermitian topological systems were uncovered, the fundamental role of symmetry in non-Hermitian physics has yet to be fully understood, and it has remained unclear how symmetry protects non-Hermitian topological phases. Here we show that two fundamental anti-unitary symmetries, time-reversal and particle-hole symmetries, are topologically equivalent in the complex energy plane and hence unified in non-Hermitian physics. A striking consequence of this symmetry unification is the emergence of unique non-equilibrium topological phases that have no counterparts in Hermitian systems. We illustrate this by presenting a non-Hermitian counterpart of the Majorana chain in an insulator with time-reversal symmetry and that of the quantum spin Hall insulator in a superconductor with particle-hole symmetry. Our work establishes a fundamental symmetry principle in non-Hermitian physics and paves the way towards a unified framework for non-equilibrium topological phases.},

	journal = {Journal of Physics Communications},
	abstract = {The bulk-boundary correspondence is crucial to topological insulators. It associates the existence of boundary states (with zero energy and possessing chiral or helical properties) with the topological numbers defined in bulk. In recent years, topology has been extended to non-hermitian systems, opening a new research area called non-hermitian topological insulator. In this paper, however, we will illustrate that the bulk-boundary correspondence does not hold in these new models. This is because a prerequisite condition: ‘the boundaries cannot alter most of the bulk states, so as to the topological numbers defined on them’ does not hold any longer. This cuts out the correspondence between the topological numbers and the boundary states. We will illustrate that, as approaching the open boundary condition by eliminating the strength of the hopping between the two ends of a chain, a new series of exceptional points must be passed through and the topological structure of the spectrum in the complex plane has been changed. This makes the spectrum topology different for the chains with and without boundaries. We also discuss that such exotic behavior does not emerge when the open boundary is replaced by a domain-wall. So the index theorem can be applied to the systems with domain-walls but cannot be further used to those with open boundaries.}

abstract = {A new formulation of the theory of nuclear reactions based on the properties of a generalized “optical” potential is presented. The real and imaginary part of this potential satisfy a dispersion type relation while its poles give rise to resonances in nuclear reactions. A new derivation of the Breit-Wigner formula is given in which the concept of channel radius is not employed. This derivation is extended to the case of overlapping resonances. These results can then be employed to obtain the complex potential well model for pure elastic scattering. This potential well is shown to become real as the average width of the resonances increases. Reactions as well as elastic scattering are treated. Considering the former process in an isolated resonance, we obtain a nonresonant term analogous to the familiar potential scattering term of elastic scattering. This is just the direct interaction term which thus appears automatically in this formalism. Upon performing the appropriate energy averages over resonances, the complex potential well model is generalized so as to include inelastic scattering. The effects of the identity of nucleons is investigated. It is shown that our formalism is valid as long as the exit channels can at most contain one nucleon.}

The principal device employed, as in part I, is the projection operator which selects the open channel components of the wave function. It is found that the formal structure of part I providing a unified description for direct and compound nuclear reactions including the coupled equation description for direct reactions remains valid in this wider context. A Kapur-Peierls expansion may also be readily obtained. The concept of channel radii is not needed nor is any decomposition of the wave function for the system into angular momentum eigenstates required, so that the expressions for transition amplitudes and widths are invariant with respect to the angular momentum coupling scheme. Since the open channels can only be defined in an asymptotic sense, the corresponding projection operators are not unique. As a consequence the projection operator method has a flexibility which in the first place is consonant with the wide range of phenomena which can occur in nuclear reactions and in the second place can effectively exploit an intuitive understanding of the phenomena. Example of projection operators are obtained including one which leads to the Wigner-Eisenbud formalism, another which is appropriate for the stripping reaction, and, finally, one which takes the Pauli exclusion principle into account. Note that explicit representations of the projection operators are not required for the development of general formal results but are necessary if, eventually, quantitative calculations are made.}

A standard axiom of quantum mechanics requires that H be Hermitian because Hermiticity guarantees that the energy spectrum is real and that time evolution is unitary (probability-preserving). This paper describes an alternative formulation of quantum mechanics in which the mathematical axiom of Hermiticity (transpose +complex conjugate) is replaced by the physically transparent condition of space–time reflection ( ) symmetry. If H has an unbroken symmetry, then the spectrum is real. Examples of -symmetric non-Hermitian quantum-mechanical Hamiltonians are and . Amazingly, the energy levels of these Hamiltonians are all real and positive!

Does a -symmetric Hamiltonian H specify a physical quantum theory in which the norms of states are positive and time evolution is unitary? The answer is that if H has an unbroken symmetry, then it has another symmetry represented by a linear operator . In terms of , one can construct a time-independent inner product with a positive-definite norm. Thus, -symmetric Hamiltonians describe a new class of complex quantum theories having positive probabilities and unitary time evolution.

The Lee model provides an excellent example of a -symmetric Hamiltonian. The renormalized Lee-model Hamiltonian has a negative-norm ‘ghost’ state because renormalization causes the Hamiltonian to become non-Hermitian. For the past 50 years there have been many attempts to find a physical interpretation for the ghost, but all such attempts failed. The correct interpretation of the ghost is simply that the non-Hermitian Lee-model Hamiltonian is -symmetric. The operator for the Lee model is calculated exactly and in closed form and the ghost is shown to be a physical state having a positive norm. The ideas of symmetry are illustrated by using many quantum-mechanical and quantum-field-theoretic models.}

abstract={Bulk--boundary correspondence, a guiding principle in topological matter, relates robust edge states to bulk topological invariants. Its validity, however, has so far been established only in closed systems. Recent theoretical studies indicate that this principle requires fundamental revisions for a wide range of open systems with effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. Therein, the intriguing localization of nominal bulk states at boundaries, known as the non-Hermitian skin effect, suggests a non-Bloch band theory in which non-Bloch topological invariants are defined in generalized Brillouin zones, leading to a general bulk--boundary correspondence beyond the conventional framework. Here, we experimentally observe this fundamental non-Hermitian bulk--boundary correspondence in discrete-time non-unitary quantum-walk dynamics of single photons. We demonstrate pronounced photon localizations near boundaries even in the absence of topological edge states, thus confirming the non-Hermitian skin effect. Facilitated by our experimental scheme of edge-state reconstruction, we directly measure topological edge states, which are in excellent agreement with the non-Bloch topological invariants. Our work unequivocally establishes the non-Hermitian bulk--boundary correspondence as a general principle underlying non-Hermitian topological systems and paves the way for a complete understanding of topological matter in open systems.},

Surprisingly, it turns out that, if such a Jordan curve is present, the spectra of all the principal submatrices have to be real. The latter claim is also proved for matrices given by a more general symbol. The special role of the Jordan curve is further demonstrated by a new formula for the limiting density of the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution for banded Toeplitz matrices from the studied class. Certain connections between the problem under investigation, Jacobi operators, and the Hamburger moment problem are also discussed. The main results are illustrated by several concrete examples; some of them allow an explicit analytic treatment, while some are only treated numerically.},

abstract = {Toeplitz matrices occur in many mathematical as well as scientific and engineering investigations. This paper considers the spectra of banded Toeplitz and quasi-Toeplitz matrices with emphasis on nonnormal matrices of arbitrarily large order and relatively small bandwidth. These are the type of matrices that appear in the investigation of stability and convergence of difference approximations to partial differential equations. Quasi-Toeplitz matrices are the result of non-Dirichlet boundary conditions for the difference approximations. The eigenvalue problem for a banded Toeplitz or quasi-Toeplitz matrix of large order is, in general, analytically intractable and (for nonnormal matrices) numerically unreliable. An asymptotic (matrix order tends to infinity) approach partitions the (asymptotic) spectrum of a quasi-Toeplitz matrix into two parts; namely, the analysis for the boundary condition independent spectrum and the analysis for the boundary condition dependent spectrum. The boundary condition independent spectrum is the same as the pure Toeplitz matrix spectrum. Algorithms for computing both parts of the asymptotic spectrum are presented. Examples are used to demonstrate the utility of the algorithms, to present some interesting spectra, and to point out some of the numerical difficulties encountered when conventional matrix eigenvalue routines are employed for nonnormal matrices of large order. The analysis for the Toeplitz spectrum also leads to a diagonal similarity transformation that improves conventional numerical eigenvalue computations. Finally, the algorithm for the asymptotic spectrum is extended to the Toeplitz generalized eigenvalue problem which occurs, for example, in the stability analysis of Padé type difference approximations to differential equations. }

    abstract = { A diagonalizable non-Hermitian Hamiltonian having a real spectrum may be used to define a unitary quantum system, if one modifies the inner product of the Hilbert space properly. We give a comprehensive and essentially self-contained review of the basic ideas and techniques responsible for the recent developments in this subject. We provide a critical assessment of the role of the geometry of the Hilbert space in conventional quantum mechanics to reveal the basic physical principle motivating our study. We then offer a survey of the necessary mathematical tools, present their utility in establishing a lucid and precise formulation of a unitary quantum theory based on a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, and elaborate on a number of relevant issues of fundamental importance. In particular, we discuss the role of the antilinear symmetries such as \${\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}}\$, the true meaning and significance of the so-called charge operators \$\mathcal{C}\$ and the \${\mathcal{C}\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}}\$-inner products, the nature of the physical observables, the equivalent description of such models using ordinary Hermitian quantum mechanics, the pertaining duality between local-non-Hermitian versus nonlocal-Hermitian descriptions of their dynamics, the corresponding classical systems, the pseudo-Hermitian canonical quantization scheme, various methods of calculating the (pseudo-) metric operators, subtleties of dealing with time-dependent quasi-Hermitian Hamiltonians and the path-integral formulation of the theory, and the structure of the state space and its ramifications for the quantum Brachistochrone problem. We also explore some concrete physical applications and manifestations of the abstract concepts and tools that have been developed in the course of this investigation. These include applications in nuclear physics, condensed matter physics, relativistic quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, quantum cosmology, electromagnetic wave propagation, open quantum systems, magnetohydrodynamics, quantum chaos and biophysics. }

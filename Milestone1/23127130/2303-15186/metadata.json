    "abstract": "In general, the energy spectrum of a non-Hermitian system turns out to be complex, which is not so satisfactory since the time evolution of eigenstates with complex eigenvalues is either exponentially growing or decaying. Here we provide a sufficient and necessary condition of the real spectrum under open boundary conditions for one-dimensional non-Hermitian tight-binding Hamiltonians. The necessity is directly related to the fact that the generalized Brillouin zone in one dimension is a closed loop with the origin in its interior. For some simple models, we demonstrate the sufficiency by analytically determining when the preimage of the characteristic polynomial contains a loop and showing that this loop is just the generalized Brillouin zone itself. For more complex models, the numerical results are shown. Our results indicate that real spectra are more common than one may have expected in non-Hermitian systems and are helpful for designing non-Hermitian models with real spectra.",

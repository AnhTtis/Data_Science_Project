Illustration of our desired GlueGen framework. With the proposed GlueNet model of the GlueGen framework, the pre-trained image generator (\ie UNet) can be bridged to off-the-shelf single- or multi-modal encoders to expand their functionalities, \ie, multilingual/sound-to-image generation, within a limited budget. GlueNet is trained offline and does not require back-propagation of UNet and image-text pairs for training. Therefore, GlueGen is flexible and efficient to achieve.

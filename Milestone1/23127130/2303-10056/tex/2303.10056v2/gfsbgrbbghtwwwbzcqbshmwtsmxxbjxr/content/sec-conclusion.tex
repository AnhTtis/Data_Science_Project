\section{Conclusion}
\vspace{-2mm}
Infusing the pre-trained conditional encoder into the existing T2I image generator is an exciting direction toward a more powerful AI system. However, the current encoder cannot be easily upgraded due to the tight match. This paper attempts to break such a strong constraint of the corresponding image-text models towards flexible modularization and efficient upgrading. To address the severe misalignment, we have proposed the GlueNet with both objectives for cross-model alignment and originality protection. Empirically, it is beneficial for the overall performance and enables versatile functionalities for X-to-image generation within a limited budget. We wish this work to be inspirable to the community in large-scale AI system design.

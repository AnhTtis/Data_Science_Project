\caption{Hybrid multilingual generation in resolution of 512 $\times$ 512. There are three-different-language texts in the input caption including  \textcolor{red}{Chinese}, \textcolor{blue}{Japanese} and \textcolor[RGB]{100,220,100}{English}. The caption of (a) is ``colorful, a cat painted by Picasso, sit on a table, is eating food'' and the caption of (b) is ``a white, sedan, crash into a building''. With our GlueNet infused ahead, the XLM-Roberta can guide SDM decoder to generate reasonable results where the original SDM fails to work.}\label{fig:hybrid}

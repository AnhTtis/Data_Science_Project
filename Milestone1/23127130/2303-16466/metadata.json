    "abstract": "We describe a setup of time-, spin-, and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (tr-SARPES) employing a 10.7-eV ($λ$=115.6 nm) pulse laser at 1-MHz repetition rate as a probe photon source. This equipment effectively combines technologies of a high-power Yb:fiber laser, ultraviolet-driven harmonic generation in Xe gas, and a SARPES apparatus equipped with very-low-energy-electron-diffraction (VLEED) spin detectors. A high repetition rate (1 MHz) of the probe laser allows experiments with the photoemission space-charge effects significantly reduced, despite a high flux of 10$^{13}$ photons/s on the sample. The relatively high photon energy (10.7 eV) also brings the capability of observing a wide momentum range that covers the entire Brillouin zone of many materials while ensuring high momentum resolution. The experimental setup overcomes a low efficiency of spin-resolved measurements, which gets even more severe for the pump-probed unoccupied states, and affords for investigating ultrafast electron and spin dynamics of modern quantum materials with energy and time resolutions of 25 meV and 360 fs, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Light-matter interaction not only plays an instrumental role in characterizing the material's properties via various spectroscopic techniques but also provides a general strategy to manipulate material properties via the design of novel nanostructures. This perspective summarizes recent theoretical advances in modeling light-matter interactions in chemistry, mainly focusing on plasmon chemistry and polariton chemistry. The former utilizes the highly localized photon, plasmonic hot electrons, and local heat to drive chemical reactions. In contrast, polariton chemistry tune chemistry by modifying the potential energy curvatures via polariton formation. The perspective starts with the basic background of light-matter interactions, molecular quantum electrodynamics theory, and the challenges of modeling light-matter interactions in chemistry. Then, the recent advances in modeling plasmon and polariton chemistry are described, and future directions toward multiscale simulations of light-matter interaction-mediated chemistry are discussed.",

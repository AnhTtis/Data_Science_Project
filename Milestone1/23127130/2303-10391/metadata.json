    "abstract": "The task of rendezvous (also called {\\em gathering}) calls for a meeting of two or more mobile entities, starting from different positions in some environment. Those entities are called mobile agents or robots, and the environment can be a network modeled as a graph or a terrain in the plane, possibly with obstacles. The rendezvous problem has been studied in many different scenarios. Two among many adopted assumptions particularly influence the methodology to be used to accomplish rendezvous. One of the assumptions specifies whether the agents in their navigation can see something apart from parts of the environment itself, for example other agents or marks left by them. The other assumption concerns the way in which the entities move: it can be either deterministic or randomized. In this paper we survey results on deterministic rendezvous of agents that cannot see the other agents prior to meeting them, and cannot leave any marks.",

    "abstract": "We revisit the ground state of the Hubbard model on 2-legged ladders in this work. We perform DMRG calculation on large system sizes with large kept states and perform extrapolation of DMRG results with truncation errors in the converged region. We find the superconducting correlation exponent $K_{sc}$ extracted from the pair-pair correlation is very sensitive to the position of the reference bond, reflecting a huge boundary effect on it. By systematically removing the effects from boundary conditions, finite sizes, and truncation errors in DMRG, we obtain the most accurate value of $K_{sc}$ and $K_ρ$ so far with DMRG. With these exponents, we confirm that the 2-legged Hubbard model is in the Luther-Emery liquid phase with $K_{sc} \\cdot K_ρ= 1$ from tiny doping near half-filling to $1/8$ hole doping. When the doping is increased to $δ\\gtrapprox 1/6$, the behaviors of charge, pairing, and spin correlations don't change qualitatively, but the relationship $K_{sc} \\cdot K_ρ= 1$ is likely to be violated. With the further increase of the doping to $δ= 1/3$, the quasi long-ranged charge correlation turns to a true long-ranged charge order and the spin gap is closed, while the pair-pair correlation still decays algebraically.",

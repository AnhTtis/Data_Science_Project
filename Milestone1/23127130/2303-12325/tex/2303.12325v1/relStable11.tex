\label{sec:RSM11}


\begin{cl}\label{cl:equvDefW}
\RWSM\ definition given in Definition~\ref{def:rwsm11} is a generalization of the \RSM\ definition given in Definition~\ref{def:rsmHRLQ}~\cite{krishnaa2023envy}.
\end{cl}
\begin{proof}
The proof follows from the proof of Claim~\ref{cl:equvDef}.
\end{proof}







\begin{cl}\label{cl:NPHard}
Computing a maximum size \CRWSM\ is NP-hard even for the stable marriage problem with 1-sided lower quotas and without ties~\cite{krishnaa2023envy}.
\end{cl}

The Alfvén, fast and slow magnetoacoustic, and entropy modes are analysed by phase speed and wave front diagrams and compared to their counterparts in magnetohydrodynamics ({MHD}) where collisions maintain an isotropic pressure. Two main classes of {CGL} waves are identified, pseudo-{MHD} and reverse-{MHD} where the latter has the slow wave speed greater than the Alfvén wave speed. Significant differences of the {CGL} hydromagnetic waves as compared to {MHD} waves are found which have special relevance for a study of infinitesimal and finite discontinuities in space plasmas.},

Introduction to Space Physics provides a broad, yet selective, treatment of the complex interactions of the ionized gases of the solar terrestrial environment. The book includes extensive discussion of the Sun and solar wind, the magnetized and unmagnetized planets, and the fundamental processes of space plasmas including shocks, plasma waves, {ULF} waves, wave particle interactions, and auroral processes. The text devotes particular attention to space plasma observations and integrates these with phenomenological and theoretical interpretations. Highly coordinated chapters, written by experts in their fields, combine to provide a comprehensive introduction to space physics. Based on an advanced undergraduate and graduate course presented in the Department of Earth and Space Sciences at the University of California, Los Angeles, the text will be valuable to both students and professionals in the field},

The Hall electric potential well created in the proton decoupling region results in bounce trajectories of the protons which appears as a characteristic variation of one of the in-plane off-diagonal components of the proton pressure tensor in this region. The event studied in this paper is found to be consistent with classical Hall field signatures with a possible 20\% guide field. Moreover, correlations between this pressure tensor component, magnetic field and bulk flow are proposed and validated, together with the expected counterstreaming proton distribution functions.},

The new results raise the question of whether the discontinuities with both small magnitude changes and small normal components are TDs with small magnitude changes or RDs with small normal components. Reexamination of an earlier study of discontinuities observed with the ISEE 3 spacecraft and consideration of the plasma jump conditions across some of the discontinuities observed by Cluster fail to give a clear answer. The pros and cons of the two interpretations are summarized.},

We examine the Alfvénicity of a set of 188 solar wind directional discontinuities (DDs) identified in the Cluster data from 2003 by Knetter (2005), with the objective of separating rotational discontinuities (RDs) from tangential ones (TDs). The DDs occurred over the full range of solar wind velocities and magnetic shear angles. By performing the Walén test in the de Hoffmann–Teller (HT) frame, we show that 77 of the 127 crossings for which a good HT frame was found had plasma flow speeds exceeding 80\% of the Alfvén speed at an average angular deviation of 7.7°; 33 cases had speeds exceeding 90\% of the Alfvén speed at an average angle of 6.4°. We show that the angular deviation between flow velocity (in the HT frame) and the Alfvén velocity can be obtained from a reduced form of the Walén correlation coefficient. The corresponding results from the Walén test expressed in terms of jumps in flow speed and corresponding jumps in Alfvén speed are similar: 66 of the same 127 cases had velocity jumps exceeding 80\% with average angular deviation of 5.8°, and 22 exceeding 90\% of the jump in Alfvén speed, with average angular deviation 6.2°. We conclude that a substantial fraction of the 127 events can be identified as RDs. We present further evidence for coupling across the DDs by showing that, for most of the 127 crossings, the HT frame velocities, evaluated separately on the two sides of the DD, are nearly the same – a result required for RDs but not for TDs. We also show that the degree of Alfvénicity is nearly the same for the DDs and fluctuations in which the DDs are embedded. Whatever process causes deviations from ideal Alfvénicity appears to operate equally for the DDs as for the surrounding fluctuations. Finally, our study has established a unique relation between the strahl electron pitch angle and the sign of the Walén slope, implying antisunward propagation in the plasma frame for all 127 cases.},

            One of the major questions about magnetic reconnection is how specific solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field conditions influence where reconnection occurs at the Earth’s magnetopause. There are two reconnection scenarios discussed in the literature: a) anti-parallel reconnection and b) component reconnection. Early spacecraft observations were limited to the detection of accelerated ion beams in the magnetopause boundary layer to determine the general direction of the reconnection X-line location with respect to the spacecraft. An improved view of the reconnection location at the magnetopause evolved from ionospheric emissions observed by polar-orbiting imagers. These observations and the observations of accelerated ion beams revealed that both scenarios occur at the magnetopause. Improved methodology using the time-of-flight effect of precipitating ions in the cusp regions and the cutoff velocity of the precipitating and mirroring ion populations was used to pinpoint magnetopause reconnection locations for a wide range of solar wind conditions. The results from these methodologies have been used to construct an empirical reconnection X-line model known as the Maximum Magnetic Shear model. Since this model’s inception, several tests have confirmed its validity and have resulted in modifications to the model for certain solar wind conditions. This review article summarizes the observational evidence for the location of magnetic reconnection at the Earth’s magnetopause, emphasizing the properties and efficacy of the Maximum Magnetic Shear Model.},

When the relative drift between the ions and electrons is of the order the Alfvén speed the large scale outflows from the X‐line necessary for fast reconnection cannot develop and the reconnection is suppressed.

            Ion observations from the Cluster spacecraft are used to investigate magnetopause reconnection for northward Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) conditions. When the spacecraft cross the magnetopause and enter the magnetosphere at low latitudes, equatorward of the magnetospheric cusps, multiple ion populations of magnetosheath origin are almost always observed. The bulk flow velocities of these separate populations are consistent with their entry at high northern and southern latitudes. Furthermore, characteristics of the pitch angle distributions provide a means to estimate the entry point of the magnetosheath ions and the relative timing of the reconnections in opposite hemispheres. In the example presented, these entry points are poleward of both magnetospheric cusps, and the reconnections are separated by minutes. In a survey of magnetopause crossing events, most ion observations and associated electron observations are consistent with this dual‐lobe reconnection process as long as the reconnections are separated in time by several minutes. A small percentage of events are not consistent with this reconnection model and may indicate reconnection at other locations, such as equatorward of the cusp.

              Magnetic reconnection at the Earth's magnetopause plays an important role in magnetospheric dynamics. Understanding the dynamics requires theory and observations. Previous theoretical work suggests that for no guide field, ions in the exhaust region on the magnetosheath side of the boundary counterstream with a velocity separation that is twice the upstream Alfvén speed (

              ) and that the counterstreaming velocity decreases with increasing guide field. These theoretical predictions are tested for reconnection at the Earth's magnetopause using observations from the Cluster spacecraft. The difference between the incident and reflected ion velocities (

              ) is predicted to approach 1 for reconnection with shear angles near 180° (no guide field) but is observed to reach a value of approximately 0.84 for the magnetopause crossings analyzed with shear angles near 180°. This value is consistent with previous observations of ion velocities from reconnection at the magnetopause investigated using the Walén relation. While magnetic shear angle can contribute to the disagreement between observations and the Walén relation, it does not play a large role, given the reduced ratio for the events near 180° in this study.

            The terrestrial magnetopause forms the boundary between the solar wind plasma with its embedded interplanetary magnetic field on one side, and the terrestrial magnetosphere, dominated by Earth's dipole field, on the other side. It is therefore a key region for the transfer of mass, momentum, and energy from the solar wind to the magnetosphere. The Cluster mission, comprising a constellation of four spacecraft flying in formation was launched more than 20 years ago to study boundaries in space. During its lifetime, Cluster has provided a wealth of new knowledge about the magnetopause. In this paper, we give an overview of Cluster‐based studies of this boundary, and highlight a selection of interesting results.

Accelerated plasma flows whose magnitude and direction were consistent with the predictions of reconnection theory were observed on each of several satellite encounters with the magnetopause and boundary layer during this 5‐hour period. Further, the field variations through the magnetopause layer suggest that the magnetopause had the structure of a rotational discontinuity as required by reconnection theory. These observations thus indicate that on occasion reconnection at the dayside magnetopause can be a quasi‐stationary process. Geomagnetic activity during this 5‐hour period, and for at least 9 hours thereafter, was extremely low. Thus dayside reconnection is certainly not a sufficient condition for enhanced geomagnetic activity.},

            This paper describes the generation and initial utilization of a database containing 80 vector and scalar quantities, for a total of 8,670 magnetopause and magnetosheath current sheet crossings by MMS1, using plasma and magnetic field data from the Fast Plasma Investigation, Fluxgate Magnetometer, and Hot Plasma Composition Analyzer instruments, augmented by solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field data from CDAWeb. Based on a determination of the current sheet width, measured and calculated vector and scalar quantities are stored for the two sides of the current sheet and for selected times within the current sheet. The only manual operations were the classification of the current sheets according to the type of boundary, the character of the magnetic field transition, and the quality of the current sheet fit. To characterize the database, histograms of selected key quantities are presented. We then give the statistics for the duration, motion, and thicknesses of the magnetopause current sheet, using single‐spacecraft techniques for the determination of the normal velocities, obtaining median results of 12.9 s, 38.5 km/s, and 705.4 km, respectively. When scaled to the ion inertial length, the median thickness became 12.6; there were no thicknesses less than one. Next, we apply the Walén relation to find crossings that are rotational discontinuities and thus may indicate ongoing magnetic reconnection. For crossings where the velocities in the outflow region exceed the velocity on the magnetosheath side by at least 250 km/s, 47\% meet our rotational discontinuity criteria. If we require the outflow to exceed 250 km/s along the L direction, then the percentage rises to 68\%.

The magnetopause was in a state of slow non-oscillatory motion during the observational period. Coherent structures of magnetosheath plasma, here typified as plasmoids, were seen on closed magnetic field lines on the inside of the magnetopause. Using simultaneous measurements on two spacecraft, the inward motion of the plasmoids is followed from one spacecraft to the next, and it is found to be in agreement with the measured ion velocity. The plasma characteristics and the direction of motion of the plasmoids show that they have penetrated the magnetopause, and the observations are consistent with the concept of impulsive penetration, as it is known from theory, simulations, and laboratory experiments. The mean flux across the magnetopause observed was 0.2\%–0.5\% of the solar wind flux at the time, and the peak values of the flux inside the plasmoids reached approximately 20\% of the solar wind flux.},

            Plain Language Summary
            We discuss methods for determining coordinate systems in order to study magnetic reconnection events at the magnetopause, the boundary between the ionized gas in the region of space dominated by the Earth's magnetic field and the ionized gas coming from the solar wind. We introduce a new method that combines results from multiple methods in order to determine the three coordinate directions in space. We demonstrate this method by applying it to an event observed by the Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft on 16 October 2015 and at other times.

              We present measurements from the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission taken during a reconnection event on the dayside magnetopause which includes a passage through an electron diffusion region (EDR). The four MMS satellites were separated by about 10 km such that estimates of gradients and divergences allow a reasonable estimate of terms in the generalized Ohm's law, which is key to investigating the energy dissipation during reconnection. The strength and character of dissipation mechanisms determines how magnetic energy is released. We show that both electron pressure gradients and electron inertial effects are important, but not the only participants in reconnection near EDRs, since there are residuals of a few mV/m ({\textasciitilde}30–50\%) of

            We present Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission measurements during a full magnetopause crossing associated with an enhanced southward ion flow. A quasi‐steady magnetospheric whistler mode wave emission propagating toward the reconnection region with quasi‐parallel and oblique wave angles is detected just before the opening of the magnetic field lines and the detection of escaping energetic electrons. Its source is likely the perpendicular temperature anisotropy of magnetospheric energetic electrons. In this region, perpendicular and parallel currents as well as the Hall electric field are calculated and found to be consistent with the decoupling of ions from the magnetic field and the crossing of a magnetospheric separatrix region. On the magnetosheath side, Hall electric fields are found smaller as the density is larger but still consistent with the decoupling of ions. Intense quasi‐parallel whistler wave emissions are detected propagating both toward and away from the reconnection region in association with a perpendicular anisotropy of the high‐energy part of the magnetosheath electron population and a strong perpendicular current, which suggests that in addition to the electron diffusion region, magnetosheath separatrices could be a source region for whistler waves.

	abstract = {A unified minimum‐residue approach is presented to the use of classical conservation laws for determination of the orientation and motion of a plasma discontinuity, using data from a single spacecraft that traverses the discontinuity and makes measurements, not only on its two sides but also within it. The method is a generalization of the minimum Faraday residue (MFR) analysis technique described by Khrabrov and Sonnerup (1998a). It includes not only the standard MHD conservation laws for mass, momentum, total energy, and (where applicable) entropy, but also magnetic flux conservation from Faraday's law, absence of magnetic poles from ∇ ·
              B
              = 0, and electric charge conservation from Ampère's law. A method, denoted by COM, for combining the results from more than one conservation law into a single optimal determination of the orientation and motion is presented, along with a general approach to the application of a certain class of constraints that can be placed on the vector normal to the discontinuity. The methodology, which is applicable to many types of discontinuity, including shocks, is illustrated by analysis of one magnetopause encounter by two of the four Cluster spacecraft (C1 and C3). The results from the various individual methods have considerable spread. However, in favorable circumstances and by exercising considerable care, the vector normal to the magnetopause from COM can be accurate to within a couple of degrees. For the C1 crossing, believed to be nearly a tangential discontinuity, albeit with signatures of incipient reconnection, the magnetopause speed (−56 km s
              −1
              ) from COM appears accurate to within a few km s
              −1
              . The plasma flow across the magnetopause and the normal field component are both very nearly zero, and the results are consistent with those obtained from timing of the layer as it crosses the four Cluster spacecraft (assuming a constant thickness of the layer). The results for the velocity of the magnetopause and for the plasma flow across the layer are less consistent for the C3 crossing, believed to be a rotational discontinuity. For this crossing the presence of a component of the magnetic field along the normal direction could not be established with certitude. It is likely that the lower quality of the results for this crossing is caused by local multidimensional structure of the magnetopause.},

In such asymmetric and non-coplanar systems, it is not yet understood what the orientation of the X-line will be. Studying how this orientation is determined locally by the reconnection process is important to understand systems such as the Earth magnetopause, where reconnection occurs in regions with large differences in upstream plasma and field properties. This study aims at determining what the local X-line orientation is for different upstream magnetic shear angles in an asymmetric set-up relevant to the Earth’s magnetopause. We use two-dimensional hybrid simulations and vary the simulation plane orientation with regard to the fixed magnetic field profile and search for the plane maximizing the reconnection rate. We find that the plane defined by the bisector of upstream fields maximizes the reconnection rate and this appears not to depend on the magnetic shear angle, domain size or upstream plasma and asymmetries.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The Grad-Shafranov (GS) reconstruction technique, a single-spacecraft based data analysis method for recovering approximately two-dimensional (2-D) magnetohydrostatic plasma/field structures in space, is improved to become a multi-spacecraft technique that produces a single field map by ingesting data from all four Cluster spacecraft into the calculation. The plasma pressure, required for the technique, is measured in high time resolution by only two of the spacecraft, C1 and C3, but, with the help of spacecraft potential measurements available from all four spacecraft, the pressure can be estimated at the other spacecraft as well via a relationship, established from C1 and C3 data, between the pressure and the electron density deduced from the potentials. Consequently, four independent field maps, one for each spacecraft, can be reconstructed and then merged into a single map. The resulting map appears more accurate than the individual single-spacecraft based ones, in the sense that agreement between magnetic field variations predicted from the map to occur at each of the four spacecraft and those actually measured is significantly better. Such a composite map does not satisfy the GS equation any more, but is optimal under the constraints that the structures are 2-D and time-independent. Based on the reconstruction results, we show that, even on a scale of a few thousand km, the magnetopause surface is usually not planar, but has significant curvature, often with intriguing meso-scale structures embedded in the current layer, and that the thickness of both the current layer and the boundary layer attached to its earthward side can occasionally be larger than 3000km.},

            We present an automatic classification method of the three near‐Earth regions, the magnetosphere, the magnetosheath and the solar wind from their in situ data measurement by multiple spacecraft. Based on gradient boosting classifier, this very simple and very fast method outperforms the detection routines based on manually set thresholds. The method is used to identify 15,062 magnetopause crossings and 17,227 bow shock crossings in the data of 11 different spacecraft of the THEMIS, ARTEMIS, Cluster, MMS, and Double Star missions and for a total of 83 cumulated years. These multi‐mission catalogs are easily reproducible, can be automatically enlarged with additional data and their elaboration paves the way for future massive statistical analysis of near‐Earth boundaries.

            Magnetic field draping occurs when the magnetic field lines frozen in a plasma flow wrap around a body or plasma environment. The draping of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) around the Earth’s magnetosphere has been confirmed in the early days of space exploration. However, its global and three‐dimensional structure is known from modeling only, mostly numerical. Here, this structure in the dayside of the Earth’s magnetosheath is determined as a function of the upstream IMF orientation purely from in‐situ spacecraft observations. We show the draping structure can be organized in three regimes depending on how radial the upstream IMF is. Quantitative analysis demonstrates how the draping pattern results from the magnetic field being frozen in the magnetosheath flow, deflected around the magnetopause. The role of the flow is emphasized by a comparison of the draping structure to that predicted to a magnetostatic draping.

Only a small fraction of the magnetopause crossings examined present a sufficiently coherent structure that they can be compared with theoretical predictions, and only a few of the hodograms of the magnetic field at the crossings show the ideal rotation expected for a rotational discontinuity structure. Observed senses of rotation are not consistent with the predictions of the electron whistler polarization theory. Rotations greater than 180° are very seldom observed; they usually occur across multiple crossings, either as 360° rotation about the minimum variance direction or, occasionally, in more complicated patterns associated with ‘S’‐shaped hodograms. These observations suggest that the sense of the magnetic field rotation through the magnetopause is controlled by the relative orientation of the magnetosheath and magnetospheric field and that the angular rotation is minimized when the magnetic field changes from one orientation to the other.},

            The magnetopause is a current sheet forming the boundary between the geomagnetic field on one side and the shocked solar wind on the other side. This paper discusses properties of the low‐latitude dawn and dusk flanks of the magnetopause. The reported results are based on a large number of measurements obtained by the Cluster satellites during magnetopause traversals. Using a combination of single‐spacecraft and multispacecraft techniques, we calculated macroscopic features such as thickness, location, and motion of the magnetopause. The results show that the typical flank magnetopause is significantly thicker than the dayside magnetopause and also possesses a pronounced and persistent dawn‐dusk asymmetry. Thicknesses vary from 150 to 5000 km, with an median thickness of around 1400 km at dawn and around 1150 km at dusk. Current densities are on average higher on dusk, suggesting that the total current at dawn and dusk are similar. Solar wind conditions and the interplanetary magnetic field cannot fully explain the observed dawn‐dusk asymmetry. For a number of crossings we were also able to derive detailed current density profiles. The profiles show that the magnetopause often consists of two or more adjacent current sheets, each current sheet typically several ion gyroradii thick and often with different current direction. This demonstrates that the flank magnetopause has a structure that is more complex than the thin, one‐dimensional current sheet described by a Chapman‐Ferraro layer.

            This paper describes the generation and initial utilization of a database containing 80 vector and scalar quantities, for a total of 8,670 magnetopause and magnetosheath current sheet crossings by MMS1, using plasma and magnetic field data from the Fast Plasma Investigation, Fluxgate Magnetometer, and Hot Plasma Composition Analyzer instruments, augmented by solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field data from CDAWeb. Based on a determination of the current sheet width, measured and calculated vector and scalar quantities are stored for the two sides of the current sheet and for selected times within the current sheet. The only manual operations were the classification of the current sheets according to the type of boundary, the character of the magnetic field transition, and the quality of the current sheet fit. To characterize the database, histograms of selected key quantities are presented. We then give the statistics for the duration, motion, and thicknesses of the magnetopause current sheet, using single‐spacecraft techniques for the determination of the normal velocities, obtaining median results of 12.9 s, 38.5 km/s, and 705.4 km, respectively. When scaled to the ion inertial length, the median thickness became 12.6; there were no thicknesses less than one. Next, we apply the Walén relation to find crossings that are rotational discontinuities and thus may indicate ongoing magnetic reconnection. For crossings where the velocities in the outflow region exceed the velocity on the magnetosheath side by at least 250 km/s, 47\% meet our rotational discontinuity criteria. If we require the outflow to exceed 250 km/s along the L direction, then the percentage rises to 68\%.

              We present measurements from the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission taken during a reconnection event on the dayside magnetopause which includes a passage through an electron diffusion region (EDR). The four MMS satellites were separated by about 10 km such that estimates of gradients and divergences allow a reasonable estimate of terms in the generalized Ohm's law, which is key to investigating the energy dissipation during reconnection. The strength and character of dissipation mechanisms determines how magnetic energy is released. We show that both electron pressure gradients and electron inertial effects are important, but not the only participants in reconnection near EDRs, since there are residuals of a few mV/m ({\textasciitilde}30–50\%) of

            Particle‐in‐cell simulations and analytical theory are employed to study the electron diffusion region in asymmetric reconnection, which is taking place in planar configurations without a guide field. The analysis presented here focuses on the nature of the local reconnection electric field and on differences from symmetric configurations. Further emphasis is on the complex structure of the electron distribution in the diffusion region, which is generated by the mixing of particles from different sources. We find that the electric field component that is directly responsible for flux transport is provided not by electron pressure‐based, “quasi‐viscous,” terms but by inertial terms. The quasi‐viscous component is shown to be critical in that it is necessary to sustain the required overall electric field pattern in the immediate neighborhood of the reconnection X line.

	abstract = {Interplanetary discontinuities have been investigated at heliocentric distances between 1 and 8.5 AU by using Pioneer 10 and 11 vector helium magnetometer observations. The principal purpose of the study was to investigate a possible dependence of the rate of occurrence and properties of the discontinuities on radial distance. This objective required a separation of spatial and temporal variations and used the simultaneous nearly continuous data from both spacecraft. Discontinuities were identified by using carefully developed criteria that were shown to be comparable to those used in earlier studies but which are still applicable in the weak magnetic fields that are typical of large radial distances. Special attention was given to the identification of relatively thick discontinuities in the expectation that discontinuities might grow progressively thicker with distance. The statistics associated with the rate of occurrence of discontinuities have been shown to be well approximated by a Poisson distribution. The rate of occurrence of discontinuities undergoes large variations, from day to day and from one solar rotation to another, which are well outside the deviations to be expected on the basis of statistical fluctuations alone. Temporal changes in the rate of occurrence averaged over Bartels solar rotations were well correlated at Pioneer 10 and 11, which were separated by a distance of ≃2 AU. The time variations consisted of a slow modulation of the rate of occurrence such that successive increases and decreases persisted for several months at a time, presumably as a result of changing solar conditions. The correlation over widely separated distances is most simply interpreted by a model in which the discontinuities originate inside 1 AU, probably near the sun, and are convected outward by the solar wind. Further support for this model is provided by the statistical properties of the discontinuities at 1 and 5 AU, which were found to be very similar. Clear evidence of a decrease in the rate of occurrence ρ with distance has been obtained. The simultaneous rates from the two spacecraft reveal that this decrease is well approximated on the average by the function ρ=50

              and imply a radial gradient of 25\% per astronomical unit. This gradient may be apparent and does not necessarily imply that discontinuities actually occur less frequently at large radial distances. The decreased rate of occurrence may be associated with an increasing thickness of the discontinuities such that they no longer satisfy the identification criteria. Possible evidence of a dependence of ρ on heliographic latitude was sought, but no statistically significant dependence was found. The results of this study are inconsistent with previous inferences of a very large radial or latitudinal gradient on the basis of Pioneer 8 data (Mariani et al., 1973). The reason for this earlier result was probably the influence of time variations which occurred on a scale of several months, as was found in our study, and masqueraded as spatial variations.},

	abstract = {A magnetospheric substorm is a transient process initiated on the night side of the earth, in which a significant amount of energy derived from the solar wind‐magnetosphere interaction is deposited in the auroral ionosphere and magnetosphere. Substorms are controlled by the interplanetary magnetic field, ceasing when it points northward for long intervals and reappearing when it turns southward. In the simplest case a substorm appears to have three phases: a growth phase in which energy is extracted from the solar wind and stored in the magnetotail; an expansion phase in which energy is explosively released; a recovery phase in which the magnetosphere relaxes to a quiet state. More commonly, however, weak auroral disturbances called pesudobreakups can occur during the growth phase, or more than one expansion phase may follow a single growth phase. Often multiple onsets are so close together that only one expansion phase is evident. At times the magnetosphere undergoes a “convection bay” in which quiet‐time processes are much enhanced but transient processes are not observed in the midnight sector. The processes responsible for onset of the expansion phase are not known although various mechanisms have been suggested such as sudden commencement pressure pulses, interplanetary magnetic field direction fluctuations, near earth plasma sheet thinning, onset of tail current instabilities and the tearing mode instability. The most commonly accepted explanation of substorms is based on a reconnection model in which interplanetary magnetic field lines merge with geomagnetic field lines and draw them back over the polar cap into a long tail. A sudden onset of reconnection at an x‐type neutral line in the near‐earth tail reconnects the earth's field lines, releasing a portion of the tail's magnetic flux and injecting particles into the night side magnetosphere. Many details of substorm morphology are subjects of considerable controversy and alternative explanations not involving reconnection also exist.},

The hodogram of the tangential magnetic field component of the simulated Alfvén shock is S‐shaped with a 180° angular rotation. This is the first simulation result to show the S‐shaped hodogram associated with Alfvén shocks. The S‐shaped hodograms have been observed at the magnetopause [Berchem and Russell, 1982]. On the basis of this result, we propose that the magnetopause is an Alfvén shock where and when the hodogram is S‐shaped and rotates 180°. The upstream portion of the hodogram is always right‐hand polarized; the downstream portion is always left‐handed. The thickness of the Alfvén shock transition layer is about a few ion inertial lengths, which tends to increase with decreasing shock normal angle θ

For those upstream conditions that give rise to a center point, no {RD} structure exists; when the fixed point examined is a saddle point, numerical integration of the one‐dimensional, steady state, nonlinear gyroviscous two‐fluid equations indicates that self‐consistent complete {RD} structures may sometimes (but not always) exist. These structures involve a rotation of the tangential magnetic field by an angle ϕ that is determined by the angle θ between the upstream (or downstream) magnetic field and the vector normal to the discontinuity, by the plasma beta value, β = 2μ

If ion‐polarized {RDs} exist, they would contain a minimum in {\textbar}B{\textbar}. However, no such structures have been found. Instead, ion polarization leads to what appears to be chaotic behavior in which a solution “trajectory” emerging from one fixed point (the upstream state, say) is extremely sensitive to initial conditions and integration step length. It does not connect to a second fixed point (the downstream state) but rather winds around indefinitely in solution space. {RD} structures in the limit of the ordinary two‐fluid model, i.e., including the electron inertia terms as well as the Hall term but excluding gyroviscous stresses, are examined in an appendix. Under certain, rather special conditions, a pulselike two‐fluid {RD} structure can be found, in which the tangential field rotates in the ion sense by a fixed but now very small angle ϕ. These solutions owe their existence to the electron inertia terms in the generalized Ohm's law; the ion inertia (Hall current) term alone leads to an {RD} of infinite thickness.},

              Pressure anisotropy may modify the characteristics of magnetohydrodynamic ({MHD}) waves, in particular, the slow mode wave and the corresponding shocks and discontinuities. In this study the formation of slow shocks ({SSs}) in anisotropic plasmas is examined by solving the gyrotropic {MHD} and Hall {MHD} equations numerically for one‐dimensional Riemann problem. The {MHD} shocks and discontinuities are generated by imposing a finite normal magnetic field on the Harris type current sheet with a guide magnetic

Moreover, for some parameter values {SSs} may exhibit upstream wave trains with right‐handed polarization in contrast with the earlier prediction that {SSs} shall possess downstream left‐hand polarized wave trains based on the isotropic Hall {MHD} theory.

              We describe methods for polynomial reconstruction of the magnetic field close to a cluster of spacecraft and apply that to reconstruction of the magnetic field observed during a magnetic reconnection event on 10 August 2017 by the Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft. Four different models are described, which vary in complexity between a 12‐parameter linear model, which has only linear variation with respect to the spatial coordinates, and a 27‐parameter quadratic model, which has the full quadratic expansion except that the second derivative with respect to the Minimum Directional Derivative minimum gradient coordinate
              
              has been neglected. In contrast to previous reconstruction techniques, these reconstructions can be found using only the magnetic field and current density measured at a single time by the cluster of spacecraft. The equations satisfying
              
              are satisfied exactly, while the equations specifying the model fields at the spacecraft locations are satisfied for most models in a best least squares sense. For this magnetotail event, the models have very small errors in magnetic field components (
              
              0.1 {nT}) at a distance from the nearest spacecraft on the order of the spacecraft separation,
              
              , here equal to 20.5 km. The magnetic structures found using the quadratic models are very time dependent, with a stretched field leading to plasmoid formation at one point in time.

    "abstract": "Up to November 2022, 267 pulsars have been discovered in 36 globular clusters (GCs). In this paper, we present our studies on the distribution of GC pulsar parameters and the detection efficiency. The power law relation between the average of dispersion measure ($\\overline{\\rm DM}$) and dispersion measure difference ($Δ{\\rm DM}$) of known pulsars in GCs is $\\lgΔ{\\rm DM} \\propto 1.52 \\lg \\overline{\\rm DM}$. The sensitivity could be the key to find more pulsars. As a result, several years after the construction of a radio telescope, the GC pulsar number will be increased accordingly. We suggest that currently GCs in the southern hemisphere could have higher possibilities to find new pulsars.",

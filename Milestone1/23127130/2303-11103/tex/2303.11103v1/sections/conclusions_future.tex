\section{Conclusions \& Future Directions}
Sionna RT is the world's first differentiable ray tracer for radio propagation modeling.
It enables many new avenues for research by integrating ray tracing, link-level simulations, and \gls{ML} into one open-source framework. One of our important ambitions is to make the creation of digital twin networks as simple as possible. We are confident that Sionna RT will enable the research to make this happen and are looking forward to contributions and feedback from the community.

The controls are flexible and customizable and implemented as part of an organization-wide process to manage risk. The controls address diverse requirements derived from mission and business needs, laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Finally, the consolidated control catalog addresses security and privacy from a functionality perspective (i.e., the strength of functions and mechanisms provided by the controls) and from an assurance perspective (i.e., the measure of confidence in the security or privacy capability provided by the controls). Addressing functionality and assurance helps to ensure that information technology products and the systems that rely on those products are sufficiently trustworthy.\\ \newline \textbf{Notes:}}

USAGE:

\bibliographystyle{mybstfile}
\bibliography{IEEEabrv,mybibfile}

where the IEEE titles in the .bib database entries use the strings
defined here. e.g.,


   journal = IEEE_J_AC,


to yield "{IEEE} Trans. Automat. Contr."


IEEE uses abbreviated journal titles in their bibliographies -
this file is suitable for work that is to be submitted to the IEEE.


For work that requires full-length titles, you should use the full
titles provided in the companion file, IEEEfull.bib.


** NOTES **

 1. Journals have been grouped according to subject in order to make it
    easier to locate and extract the definitions for related journals - 
    as most works use references that are confined to a single topic.
    Magazines are listed in straight alphabetical order.

 2. String names are closely based on IEEE's own internal acronyms.
 
 3. Abbreviations follow IEEE's style.

 4. Older, out-of-print IEEE titles are included (but not including titles
    dating prior to IEEE's formation from the IRE and AIEE in 1963).

 5. The following NEW/current journal definitions have been disabled because
    their abbreviations have not yet been verified:
    
    STRING{IEEE_J_CBB        = "{IEEE/ACM} Trans. Comput. Biology Bioinformatics"}
    STRING{IEEE_J_CJECE      = "Canadian J. Elect. Comput. Eng."}
    STRING{IEEE_J_DSC        = "{IEEE} Trans. Dependable Secure Comput."}
    STRING{IEEE_O_DSO        = "{IEEE} Distrib. Syst. Online"}
    
 6. The following OLD journal definitions have been disabled because
    their abbreviations have not yet been found/verified:

    STRING{IEEE_J_BCTV       = "{IEEE} Trans. Broadcast Television Receivers"}
    STRING{IEEE_J_EWS        = "{IEEE} Trans. Eng. Writing Speech"}

If you know what the proper abbreviation is for a string in #5 or #6 above,
email me and I will correct them in the next release.

It is now frequently mentioned in relation to many areas of nursing practice, including research. Given the increasing use of the term, it is timely to examine how resilience has been defined in empirical research. \item[Design.] An integrative review of the empirical literature (2000--2015). \item[Data sources.] Three health-related databases were searched: Medline, PsycINFO and the Cumulative Index for Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL). Reference and citation tracking was performed on all articles included in the review. \item[Review methods.] The methods described by Whittemore and Knafl were used to guide this review. Two reviewers were involved in screening articles for inclusion and in the data extraction process. Data were synthesized using the constant comparative method of analysis. \item[Results.] One hundred articles were included in the final data analysis. The most significant finding of the review was that there is no universal definition of resilience. There were, however, some common themes identified: rising above, adaptation and adjustment, dynamic process, `ordinary magic' and mental illness as a marker of resilience. \item[Conclusion.] Despite the increasing use of the term `resilience', this review has identified that there is no universal definition of resilience adopted in the research literature. Further research is required to explore this construct in the context of nursing. \end{description} \end{description}}

Structure with lightweight concrete should assure adequate performance of member under heavy loading. In this study, experimental investigations have been conducted to study the displacement ductility and torsional ductility of lightweight concrete element containing high volume of waste materials. Crushed oil palm shell (OPS) is used as coarse aggregate in different mixes and palm oil clinker (POC) as fine aggregate for sand replacement. In this experiment using those waste materials palm shell clinker (PSC) concrete has been produced. Furthermore modulus of elasticity, modulus of resilience, modulus of toughness, stress–strain and torsional behavior of PSC concrete are obtained and compared with normal weight concrete (NWC) and POC lightweight concrete. The study reveals that PSC concrete, in contrast to various types of structural lightweight concrete (LWC) and NWC, is a ductile material in structural element. Though the modulus of elasticity of PSC concrete is 30\% and 37\% of NWC and POC lightweight concrete respectively, its modulus of resilience and modulus of toughness are significantly higher. The displacement ductility index of PSC concrete element is 2.8 times higher than NWC and POC lightweight concrete. In contrast the torsional ductility index of PSC lightweight concrete element is obtained 3.3 times higher than corresponding concretes. This study found that the torsional ductility of PSC concrete is higher than displacement ductility because of good interlocking properties yet for NWC, displacement ductility is higher than torsional ductility. Furthermore the modulus of toughness of PSC concrete is higher, more energy required to completely break this concrete containing high volume of waste materials. Thus PSC lightweight concrete may be more suitable than NWC and POC lightweight concrete in the earthquake-resistance of concrete structures subjected to compressive and torsional loading structure.}

While substantial gains have been made in addressing security broadly, the complexity, size, malleability and rate of change of software and hardware systems have made achieving perfect security---at least for now---a practical impossibility. Exacerbating the situation are the ever-increasing zero-day attacks. This has led to a rethinking of efforts in countering malicious behavior that asks ``Can systems be designed such that they continue to function while compromised?'' This property, referred to as cyber-resilience, provides a means of operating in the face of malicious action. \textbf{Notes:} \begin{itemize} \item They mention several eschelons of resilience (\textit{e.g.} microscale, mesoscale, team resilience, group or community resilience, maroscale, and larger scales.) \item The also reference Goodhart's law.  ``When a measure a target, it ceases to be a good measure.'' \end{itemize}}

Methodologies for the systematic design and validation of resilience for such systems are thus highly necessary, and require contributions from several different fields. This paper contributes to current resilience research by providing a conceptual framework intended to serve as a common ground for the development of such methodologies. Its main points are: the identification of the main categories of changes a system should face; a clear definition of the different facets of resilience one could want to achieve, expressed in terms of the system dynamics; a mapping of each of these facets to design strategies that are better suited to achieve it; and the corresponding identification of possible metrics that can be used to assess its achievement. \item[Definition:] Littlewood and Strigini\cite{littlewood2000software} informally define \textit{dependability} as a set of system properties ``that allows us to rely on a system functioning as required.''

In recent years, advanced sensors, intelligent automation, communication networks, and information technologies (IT) have been integrated into the electric grid to enhance its performance and efficiency. Integrating these new technologies has resulted in more interconnections and interdependencies between the physical and cyber components of the grid. Natural disasters and man-made perturbations have begun to threaten grid integrity more often. Urban infrastructure networks are highly reliant on the electric grid and consequently, the vulnerability of infrastructure networks to electric grid outages is becoming a major global concern. In order to minimize the economic, social, and political impacts of power system outages, the grid must be resilient. The concept of a power system's cyber-physical resilience centers around maintaining system states at a stable level in the presence of disturbances. Resilience is a multidimensional property of the electric grid; it requires managing disturbances originating from physical component failures, cyber component malfunctions, and human attacks. In the electric grid community, there is not a clear and universally accepted definition of cyber-physical resilience. This paper focuses on the definition of resilience for the electric grid and reviews key concepts related to system resilience. This paper aims to advance the field not only by adding cyber-physical resilience concepts to power systems vocabulary, but also by proposing a new way of thinking about grid operation with unexpected disturbances and hazards and leveraging distributed energy resources. \item[Definitions:] \begin{itemize} \item The resilience of a system presented with an unexpected set of disturbances is the system's ability to reduce the magnitude and duration of the disruption. A resilient system downgrades its functionality and alters its structure in an agile way. \item Power system cyber-physical resilience is the system's ability to maintain continuous electricity flow to customers given a certain load prioritization scheme. A resilient power system responds to cyber-physical disturbances in real-time or semi real-time, avoiding service interruptions. A resilient power system alters its structure, loads, and resources in an agile way. \end{itemize} \item[Notes:] \begin{itemize} \item ``There is no clear and universally accepted definition of cyber-physical resilience for power systems.'' \end{itemize} \end{description}}

First it illustrates and discusses some of the challenges related to the measurement of resilience by reviewing some of the most recently published and grey literature on resilience in relation to food security. Second it proposes a new framework that addresses some of the concerns and limitations of resilience measurement identified in that literature. The main postulate of this framework is that the `costs of resilience' (that is, the different ex-ante and ex-post investments, losses, sacrifices, and costs that people have to undertake at individual and collective levels to `go through' a shock or an adverse event) provide an appropriate and independent metric to measure resilience across scales and dimensions. The paper shows how the independent nature of this metrics offers an explanatory power that can be used to infer, in a testable and rigorous manner potential, causalities between the metric and household and/or community characteristics. Empirical and theoretical examples are used throughout the paper to illustrate the arguments.\\ \newline \textbf{Notes:} In this paper B{\'e}n{\'e} postulates that the `cost of resilience' defined as resilience cost = anticipation costs + impact costs + recovery costs.\\ \newline He also points out the circular analysis that exists when one of the independent variables is used to computer the score. His example is using livelihood diversification to compute resiliency. If livelihood diversification is a term in the resilience equation, then raising it will certainly raise the resiliency score. This proves nothing.\\ \newline He provides the following definition,``any capacity and skills, and action, strategy, investment and anticipation, which helps individual, households and communities to anticipate, absorb, accommodate, or recover from the impacts of a particular adverse event (shock, stress, or (un)expected changes).''}

This framework incorporates a defnition of resilience, a resilience metric as well as a resilient control design methodology. The resilient control architecture utilizes a hybrid optimal control methodology combined with a dynamic regulation market mechanism (DRMM), and is evaluated in the context of frequency regulation at a transmission grid. The framework enables the evaluation of both the classical robust control properties and emerging resilient control properties under both cyber attacks and physical faults. The proposed framework is used to assess resilience of a Cyber- Physical Energy System (CPES) when subjected to both cyber and physical faults via DETERLab. DETERLab, a testbed capable of emulating high fidelity, cybersecure, networked systems, is used to construct critical scenarios with physical faults emulated in the form of generator outages and cyber faults emulated in the form of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Under these scenarios, the resilience and performance of a CPES that is comprised of 56 generators and 99 consumers is evaluated using the hybrid-DRMM control methodology.\\ \newline \textbf{Notes:} \begin{description} \item[Definition:] Resilience of a CPS with respect to a class of extreme and high impact disturbances, is the property that characterizes its ability to withstand and recover from this particular class of disturbances by being allowed to temporarily transit to a state where its performance is signifcantly degraded and returning within acceptable time to a state where certain minimal but critical performance criteria are met. \item[Measure:] \begin{equation} R(x\_k) = \int\_{k\_1}^{k\_2} [j^\textasteriskcentered\_k - J(x\_k)]dk, R \in R\_+. \end{equation} \end{description}}

While the focus of much of the work is resilience of weapons systems or other cyber-physical systems with respect to cyber-attack, the principal findings can be applied to operational resilience broadly defined. \\ \newline \textbf{Notes:} \begin{description} \item{Section 2.1} Provides the following definition of resilience, ``is a high-level property relating to the capacity of the systems to recover from unwanted loss of function.'' Stating: ``There are no commonly accepted definitions of how to measure this system property.'' \item{Section 2.2} Cites the definition of ``operational resilience'' from DODI 8500.01 Cybersecurity March 14, 2014. ``Operational resilience may be defined as the ability of systems to resist, absorb, and recover from or adapt to an adverse occurence during operation that may cause harm, destruction, or loss of ability to perform mission-related functions.'' \item{}

Campaigns are waged by the advanced persistent threat (APT), which has the capabilities, resources and persistence to breach even well patched and monitored IT infrastructures. Therefore, today's systems must be resilient against the APT.

The CREF consists of goals, objectives and techniques. In the context of the Risk Management Framework defined by NIST SP 800-37, cyber resiliency techniques can be applied to a system, set of shared services, or common infrastructure by selecting, tailoring, and implementing security controls.

The need for cyber resiliency - for information and communications systems and those who depend on them to be resilient in the face of persistent, stealthy, and sophisticated attacks focused on cyber resources - is increasingly recognized. While resilience is sometimes described as an emergent property, resilience in the face of cyber threats must be engineered. Cyber resiliency engineering is the sub-discipline of mission assurance engineering which considers i the ways in which an evolving set of resilience practices can be applied to improve cyber resiliency, and ii the trade-offs associated with different strategies for applying those practices. This paper presents an initial framework for cyber resiliency engineering. The framework identifies Cyber resiliency goals, objectives, and practices The threat model for cyber resiliency Architectural layers or domains to which cyber resiliency practices could be applied and Aspects of cost to consider as part of the trade-off analysis for alternative strategies and implementations. This framework provides a way to structure discussions and analyses of cyber resiliency goals, objectives, practices, and costs. It also serves to motivate and characterize cyber resiliency metrics. The framework is intended to evolve as the discipline of cyber resiliency engineering matures.\\ \newline \textbf{Notes:}}

These naturally involve a higher number of Electronic Control Units (ECUs) being connected using existing conventional in-network protocols such as Controller Area Network (CAN). In this context, security of systems in now becoming a major concern while industry's primary interest in the manufacturing of cars is reliability and safety. It is now in daily new that smart cars are being hacked due to weaknesses in their embedded electronics that provides ways of hardware attacks [1][2]. Hardware Trojan (HT) is the threat that has been recently recognized as one of the primary sources of backdoor access that enables hackers to attack systems. As trouble, HT remains silent until a rare function/event triggers it for activation. This paper contributes to the challenges of demonstration of distrution in CAN buses raised from hidden Hardware Trojan. In this regard, it is presented how just a small size Hardware Trojan dirupts the CAN bus communication without an adversary having physical access to the bus. The attack is neither detectable via frame analysis, nor can be prevented via network segmentation; additionally, a rare triggering mechanism activates HT to process untracable faults.\\ \newline \textbf{Notes:} This paper reiterates much of the information from the bozdal2018survey paper, then describes their implementation and testing of an HT.}

Although the rise in electronics and connectivity has improved comfort, functionality, and safe driving, it has also created new attack surfaces to penetrate the in-vehicle communication network, which was initially designed as a close loop system. For such applications, the Controller Area Network (CAN) is the most-widely used communication protocol, which still suffers from various security issues because of the lack of encryption and authentication. As a result, any malicious/hijacked node can cause catastrophic accidents and financial loss. This paper analyses the CAN bus comprehensively to provide an outlook on security concerns. It also presents the security vulnerabilities of the CAN and a state-of-the-art attack surface with cases of implemented attack scenarios and goes through different solutions that assist in attack prevention, mainly based on an intrusion detection system (IDS).}

This paper discusses ways of addressing systems resilience within SE methodologies. This paper starts by exploring the meaning of resilience, how it applies to the engineered system, and hot it relates to established SE viewpoints and activities. This paper identifies a key distinguishing characteristic of resilience; viz., resilience requirements are an expression of the delivery of capability under adverse conditions. As such, resilience requirements include aspects of functional, performance, and evironmental requirements, and do so with focus on the adverse conditions that fully define the acceptable delivery of capability. This results in resilience requirements having a unique structure of data that must be captured for them to to be properly specified. That required data drives a need for resilience-specific considerations to be added to traditional SE activities; these activities start early in the system life cycle to establish the resilience needs, priorities, and constraints. This paper discusses the activities that need to be added. Once resilience has been addressed in the system requirements, architecture, and design, we find the SE practices that are normally carried out during the remaineder of the SE lifecycle will handle resilience considerations without alteration.}

These disruptions can incur failure of system and thus bring a more extensive loss to the whole society. The concept of resilience was introduced into transportation system since it concerned about the performance of system under disruptions. Resilience has been initially described as the ability of system to become healthy and strong again after a disruptive event. On transportation resilience, a number of scholars have carried out exploratory researches from different perspectives. However, the definitions and the connotations within it they recommended were quite multifarious. This paper took a summative review of these definitions and connotations and tried to develop an integrated description about what a resilient transportation system is, and what aspects of characters it should have.

This definition captures the subtle differences between resilience and a resilient engineered system. We further examine the terminology associated with resilience to understand the various resilient time-frames and use the terminology to propose a resilience cycle, which differentiates mission resilience (short term) and platform resilience (long term). We then provide insight into various resilience evaluation methodologies and discuss how understanding the full scope of resilience enable designers to better incorporate resilience into system design, decision makers to consider resilient trade-offs in their assessment, and operators to better manage their systems. A resilient engineered system can lead to improved performance, reduced life-cycle costs, increased value, and extended service life for engineered systems.\\ \newline \textbf{Notes:}\\ \newline \begin{description} \item[\textbf{Definition}] a system that is able to successfully complete its planned mission(s) in the face of disruption(s) (environmental or adversarial), and has capabilities allowing it to successfully complete future missions with evolving threats. \item[\textbf{Time Frame}] distinguishes between \textit{mission resilience} and \textit{platform resilience}. \textit{Mission resilience} is concerned about the resilience during a particular mission. \textit{Platform resilience} is concerned about the resilience during the life of the system. \item[\textbf{Means vs. Objective}] They discuss the importance of distinguishing the means of obtaining resilience with the objectives of resilience. pg. 21. \end{description}}

For student nurses and novice researchers it is often seen as a difficult undertaking.  It demands a complex range of skills, such as learning how to define topics for exploration, acquiring skills of literature searching and retrieval, developing the ability to analyze and synthesize data as well as becoming adept at writing and reporting, often within a limited time scale. The purpose of this article is to present a step-by-step guide to facilitate understanding by presenting the critical elements of the literature review process. While reference is made to different types of literature reviews, the focus is on the traditional or narrative review that is undertaken, usally either as an academic assignment or part of the research process. \\ \newline \textbf{Notes:}}

Many cyber security experts and analysts are used to working with traditional information technology (IT) networks and are familiar with a set of technologies that may not be directly useful in the commercial vehicle sector. To help connect security researchers to heavy trucks, a remotely accessible testbed has been prototyped for experimentation with security methodologies and techniques to evaluate and improve on existing technologies, as well as developing domain-specific technologies. The testbed relies on embedded Linux-based node controllers that can simulate the sensor inputs to various heavy vehicle electronic control units (ECUs). The node controller also monitors and affects the flow of network information between the ECUs and the vehicle communications backbone. For example, a node controller acts as a clone that generates analog wheel speed sensor data while at the same time monitors or controls the network traffic on the J1939 and J1708 networks. The architecture and functions of the node controllers are detailed. Sample interaction with the testbed is illustrated, along with a discussion of the challenges of running remote experiments. Incorporating high fidelity hardware in the testbed enables security researchers to advance the state of the art in hardening heavy vehicle ECUs against cyber-attacks. How the testbed can be used for security research is presented along with an example of its use in evaluating seed/key exchange strength and in intrusion detection systems (IDSs).\\ \newline \textbf{Notes:} Besides documenting their approach for creating a cyber security testbed for heavy vehicles, the authors describe several intrustion detection methods that were implemented to test the testbed.}

The objection that, according to current ``species concepts,'' species are relational is rejected. These concepts are primarily concerned with what it is for a kind to be a species and throw little light on the essentialist issue of what it is for an organism to be a member of a particular kind.

Recent proclamations from the White House, Department of Defense, and elsewhere have called for increased resilience in our cyber capabilities. The growth of cyber threats extends well beyond the traditional areas of security managed by Information Technology software. The new cyber threats are introduced through vulnerabilities in infrastructures and industries supporting IT capital and operations. These vulnerabilities drive establishment of the area of cyber physical systems security. Cyber physical systems security integrates security into a wide range of interdependent computing systems and adjacent systems architectures. However, the concept of cyber physical system security is poorly understood, and the approach to manage vulnerabilities is fragmented. As cyber physical systems security is better understood, it will require a risk management framework that includes an integrated approach across physical, information, cognitive, and social domains to ensure resilience. The expanse of the threat environment will require a systems engineering approach to ensure wider, collaborative resiliency. Approaching cyber physical system security through the lens of resilience will enable the application of both integrated and targeted security measures and policies that ensure the continued functionality of critical services provided by our cyber infrastructure. \item[Definitions] \begin{itemize} \item The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) defines resilience as ``The ability to prepare and plan for, absorb, recover from, or more successfully adapt to actual or potential adverse events'' (NAS 2012). \end{itemize} \end{description}}

Popper's program of competitive testing and the development of unified theories are 2 common routes toward this end. This article proposes a third and complementary route: the integration of already existing theories. To provide a systematic framework, I propose a 2-step theory integration program. The first step is integration of phenomena, that is, the study of how apparently disparate robust observations are theoretically connected, not just empirically correlated. The second step is integration of theoretical concepts, that is, the study of how apparently different explanatory concepts are linked. Links between phenomena or concepts include identity, nesting, and functional equivalence.  Functional equivalence means that 2 or more psychologically distinct theoretical concepts can be shown to imply the same behavioral pattern by vicarious functioning.  The 2-step program requires formalization and close attention to operational and conceptual definitions. It should not be seen as an algorithm that can be automatically applied, but as a heuristic method requiring creativity for building a network between theories.\\ \linebreak \textbf{Notes:} \begin{itemize} \item ``Before investigating the relation between two phenonmena, it is necessary to specify clearly what these phenomena actually are.'' \item ``The practice of using the same label for logically and operationally different phenomena impedes progress in Step 2.'' \item ``Percise identification of a phenomenon and differentiation between phenomena are the sine qua non for replication, and these measures aid understanding what would otherwise be considered puzzling empirical inconsistencies or failures of replication (Pasher \& Harris 2021).'' \item ``Theoretical definition of a concept is an important as the operational definition of a phenomenon.'' \item ``First, the4 program requires more detailed analyses of the phenomena and formal definitions of the concepts than is currently the pracrice in some areas of the cognitive and behavioral sciences.'' \end{itemize}}

This paper develops a mathematical language for resilience, using the terms and concepts of differential topology. Central to this treatment is the division of the state space of a system into basins, each containing an attractor. The translation of Holling's concept into this language reads roughly as follows: a system is resilient if, after perturbation, it will still tend to the same attractor as before (or to an ``only slightly changed'' attractor). The reason for treating changes of state variables and changes of parameters separately is explained. All resilience measures conceived up to now, as defined within this language, are listed as well. The various definitions of resilience are then compared to the well-known concepts of structural stability and of Thorn's catastrophe theory. Finally, the author indicates some--in his opinion--important directions for further research into the general resilience concept. \item[Notes:] This paper concerned itself with the theoretical mathematics to describe resilience in terms of stability theory. \end{description}}

Plato's early dialogues portray Socrates raising questions about definitions (e.g., in the Euthyphro, ``What is piety?'')---questions that seem at once profound and elusive. The key step in Anselm's ``Ontological Proof'' for the existence of God is the definition of ``God,'' and the same holds of Descartes's version of the argument in his Meditation V. More recently, the Frege-Russell definition of number and Tarski's definition of truth have exercised a formative influence on a wide range of contemporary philosophical debates. In all these cases---and many others can be cited---not only have particular definitions been debated; the nature of, and demands on, definitions have also been debated. Some of these debates can be settled by making requisite distinctions, for definitions are not all of one kind: definitions serve a variety of functions, and their general character varies with function. Some other debates, however, are not so easily settled, as they involve contentious philosophical ideas such as essence, concept, and meaning.\\ \newline \textbf{Notes:}}

Yet an account of what that involves is absent from the psychology literature. This article explains what the standard (classical) account of scientific definition is, what it is not, the steps involved in developing a scientific definition, the distinction between definition and classification, and other key points. The article then turns to recent research in the philosophy of science which proposes an alternative to the standard account.  This alternative is said to provide scientific definitions that better accommodate the inherent variation of certain kinds of phenomena. Its implications are examined and they point to it not being an alternative to the standard account at all, but an approach that captures the early-to-mid stages of research towards genuine scientific definition. Attention then turns to psychology's conception of the operational definition, how it relates to scientific definition, and what else psychologists sometimes mean by ``operationism.'' Operational definitions are not scientific definitions and it is time that psychology give consideration to the latter.\\ \textbf{Notes:} \begin{itemize} \item ``However, operational definition is not scientific definition and psychology's ongoing attachment to the former has not helped to address the challenges that Gigerenzer and others have noted.'' \item The author assumes that researchers, ``operate against a backdrop of realism.'' \item The author asserts that each phenomona is a ``particular-instance-of-a-certain-general-sort or kind.'' \item Developing scietific definitions is not the lexical exercise of defining words, but the ontological question ``what is it?'' or ``what kind of thing is it?'' \item The author states that the standard account of scientific defintions was developed by Aristotle and upheld by Devitt 2008 and others.

        \textbf{Abstract:} Modeling and evaluating the resilience of systems, potentially complex and large-scale in nature, has recently raised significant interest among both practitioners and researchers. This recent interest has resulted in several definitions of the concept of resilience and several approaches to measuring this concept, across several application domains. As such, this paper presents a review of recent research articles related to defining and quantifying resilience in various disciplines, with a focus on engineering systems. We provide a classification scheme to the approaches in the literature, focusing on qualitative and quantitative approaches and their subcategories. Addressed in this review are: an extensive coverage of the literature, an exploration of current gaps and challenges, and several directions for future research.\\ \newline \textbf{Notes:} \begin{itemize} \item ``The word resilience has been originally originated from the Latin word ``resiliere'' which means to ``bounce back.'' The common use of resilience word implies the ability of an entity or system to return to normal condition after the occurrence of an event that disrupts its state.'' \item ``Several definitions of resilience have been offered. Many overlap with a number of already existing concepts such as \textit{robustness}, \textit{fault-tolerance}, \textit{flexibility}, \textit{survivability}, and \textit{agility}, among others.''

Heavy vehicles, unlike passenger cars, are constructed using ECUs manufactured by different OEM. For reasons of interoperability, the SAE mandates that all ECU should communicate using the standardized protocol that gives semantics to the signals transmitted on the network. Security concerns are lacking from the design of used protocols and standards. Consequently, an ECU having malicious code can spoof other ECUs, , a message can be injected through the OBD-II port or the telematics unit into the internal network to deceive the driver. IDS have been proposed and utilized to detect wide ranges of security attacks. However, such systems are only capable of detecting attacks and are unable to mitigate them. In a security incident, a compromised ECU may generate invalid data values; even if such invalid values are detected, there is still a need to counter their effects. Almost all prior works focus on detecting attacks. We demonstrate how to make the vehicle resilient to attacks. We analyze the log files of real driving scenarios and show ECU are significantly dependent on other ECU to operate. We demonstrate how the parameters of a compromised ECU can be reconstructed from those of other non-compromised ECUs. This increases the resiliency of vehicles against attacks and allows it to continue operation. We achieve this by fingerprinting the behavior of an ECU using the multivariate LSTM neural network. We then reconstruct compromised ECU values using information obtained from trustworthy ECU using our proposed fingerprinting model. In our evaluation phase, we assume that each ECU value may be compromised and demonstrate how it can be reconstructed. Despite some levels of errors, our model is able to reconstruct compromised ECUs values and generate trustworthy data values to be used by other existing ECU on the network. The error, for all compromised ECU values, is less than 6\% of the operating range for the ECU, which is significantly low and can be used for other ECU. Our proposed approach improves the security of the vehicle network without requiring changes to the internal architecture.\\ \textbf{Notes:}}

We exemplify our technique through the case study of simple cyber security device (i.e., network firewall).\\ \newline \textbf{Notes:} \begin{description} \item[Definitions:] \begin{itemize} \item ``the ability to provide and maintain an acceptable level of service when facing attacks and challenges to normal operation.''(trivedi2009resilience)

        \item ``the ability to avoid, resist and recover from cyber-attacks or failures.''(multiple)

        \item ``the ability of a system to resist against (or minimize) the potential damage in order to maintain system state within an accepted operational level in response to any external threat or attack.''(their own) \end{itemize} \item[Modes:] They present 3 modes pro-active, resistive, and reactive. \item[Measurement:] They use Algebraic Petri nets to measure resilience. \end{description}

In response, regulatory authorities call for focusing attention on enhancing infrastructure resilience. For example, in the USA, President Obama issued an Executive Order and policy directives focusing on improving the resilience and security of cyber infrastructure to a wide range of cyber threats. Despite the national and international importance, resilience metrics to inform management decisions are still in the early stages of development. We apply the resilience matrix framework developed by Linkov et al. (Environ Sci Technol 47:10108-10110, 2013) to develop and organize effective resilience metrics for cyber systems. These metrics link national policy goals to specific system measures, such that resource allocation decisions can be translated into actionable interventions and investments. In this paper, a number of metrics have been identified and assessed using quantitative and qualitative measures found in the literature. We have proposed a generic approach and could integrate actual data, technical judgment, and literature-based measures to assess system resilience across physical, information, cognitive, and social domains. \item[Quotes:] \begin{itemize} \item However, current concepts and methods discussed as ways to improve resilience often conflate resilience (i.e., ability to withstand and recover quickly from unknown and known threats) and risk (i.e., product of likelihood of an adverse event and the magnitude of the resulting damage (Kaplan and Garrick 1981)). \end{itemize} \end{description}}

The ultimate goal is the ability to quantitatively evaluate and trade off multiple software quality attributes to arrive at a better overall system. The purpose of this report is to take a small step in the direction of developing a unifying approach for reasoning about multiple software quality attributes. In this report, we define software quality, introduce a generic taxonomy of attributes, discuss the connections between the attributes, and discuss future work leading to an attribute-based methodology for evaluating software architectures. \item[Quotes:] \begin{itemize} \item Software quality is the degree to which software possesses a desired combination of attributes (e.g. reliability, interoprability) [IEEE 1061]. \end{itemize} \end{description}}

With the gneerally accepted process of scientfic research, researchers seek to study specific phenomena under a number of conditions and settings with the intention of testing hypotheses. Basic concepts must have a standardized definition so that results of experiments performed under varying settings and conditions can be compared and replicated. Only then can generalizations be formulated. It serves no useful scientific purpose for researchers to compare the results of studies which disagree on fundamental issues. Such ``apples versus oranges'' comparisons are useless in the area of scientific research. \item Juran provides the most detailed and probably most helpful definition of quality for our purposes. He states:\\ \newline Reaching agreement on what is meant by quality is not simple. (The dictionary lists about a dozen definitions.) For managers, no short definition is really precise, but one such definition has received wide acceptance: quality is fitness for use.\\ \newline This definition provides a short, comprehensive label, but it does not provide the depth needed to manager to choose courses of action. On closer examination we discover that fitnes for use branches out into two rather differ directions...(Juran, 1989, pp. 15-15)\\ \newline The two branches of quality Juran refers to are product features that meet customer needs and freedom from deficiencies. With this definition of quality the characteristics emphasized by Demming (designing a product which will meet of surpass customer requirements) and Crosby (avoiding nonconformance problems or deficiencies) are both included. \end{itemize} \end{description}}

Lack of such a definition is a constant source of numerous misunderstandings and a series of mostly fruitless debates. There is little hope that there ever will be agreement on a common definition of emotion, given the sacred traditions of the disciplines involved and the egos of the scholars working in these disciplines. Our aim here is more modest. We propose a list of elements for a working definition of emotion and discuss the justification for the inclusion of elements from our respective perspectives (philosophy and psychology). This working partial definition may at least serve as a litmus test to examine theories of emotion, old and new, across disciplinary boundaries.\\ \newline \textbf{Notes:}}

        In this paper we will review and discuss the terminology and definitions that have been proposed and used for describing the terms ``resilience'' and ``resiliency'' with respect to cyber and other systems. Ultimately, we address the deficiencies of these previous definitions by choosing a definition for resilience that equates to the inverse of ``mission risk'' that is adequately qualified by the context in which it applies. In selecting a measurement (or estimated measurement) based on risk as our resilience metric, we have chosen a resilience definition that is clearly defined, measurable, and has a sound theoretical grounding. Our computable metric makes it possible to perform like-to-like systems comparisons that allow us to measure the resiliency of a system, and to use this measurement to evaluate how resiliency methods are able to improve the resiliency of a system.

ICT is now integral to almost every aspect of our daily activities. The detrimental impact of these ICT dependencies, however, is that business operations become susceptible to possible impacts from cyber incidents.  Protecting ICT from cyber incident effects or reducing their impacts on operational activities has become a problem of national importance. Concomitantly, there is an escalating imperative to identify and minimize operational cyber risk. In almost all circumstances, we are interested in achieving operational resilience: the ability for systems to continue to fulfil their intended purpose in the face of actual or potential cyber incidents. Achieving such resilience almost always must be pursued in a resource limited environment, where there is a need to justify the costs and resources needed. Unfortunately most current definitions of resilience are qualitative ones. If resilience is defined in a qualitative rather than quantitative way there is little in the way of prescriptive advice that can be offered to increase resilience. To address this deficiency we use a quantitative definition of resilience and apply it in a game theory inspired approach that considers multiple cyber attacker moves ahead. This allows us to assess defender actions as a portfolio analysis to identify a prescriptive selection of the best employment of security and resilience methods to use.\\ \textbf{Notes:}}

The management of the railway operations through the use of distributed sensors and controllers and with programmable and remotely controllable railway signals and switches has led to gains in system efficiency as well as operational flexibility. However, the network connectivity has opened up the railway cyber communication networks to cyber-attacks. These are a class of cyber-physical systems (CPS) with interconnected physical, computational, and communication components. The cyber-attacks on these systems could potentially cascade through these interconnection and result into significant damage. These systems are safety-critical owing to their large-scale monetary and, more importantly, human life safety concerns. Therefore, it is better to incorporate security and resilience requirements right from the design time. In this paper, we describe a domain-specific framework for simulations in the railway domain. The framework allows analyzing the resilience of railway operations in the presence of cyber-attacks. In particular, our simulation framework allows modeling the railway network as well as the railway transportation. It provides an online graphical modeling environment that allows multiple users to collaborate, through a web-based interface, over the same model for the railway infrastructure as well as network attacks. The framework also allows the user to configure and run experiments through the web-interface and also to visualize the key operational metrics from the railway domain as the experiment is running. The framework also supports executing large simulations in the cloud. In addition, it supports hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation for incorporating physical effects and network attacks that can only be realized realistically in the hardware. A detailed case study is provided to demonstrate the framework's capabilities.\\ \newline \textbf{Notes:}}

Drawing upon literatures in several disciplines, we present a theory of resilience that encompasses contemporary understandings of stress, adaptation, wellness, and resource dynamics. Community resilience is a process linking a network of adaptive capacities (resources with dynamic attributes) to adaptation after a disturbance or adversity. Community adaptation is manifest in population wellness, defined as high and non-disparate levels of mental and behavioral health, functioning, and quality of life. Community resilience emerges from four primary sets of adaptive capacities---Economic Development, Social Capital, Information and Communication, and Community Competence---that together provide a strategy for disaster readiness. To build collective resilience, communities must reduce risk and resource inequities, engage local people in mitigation, create organizational linkages, boost and protect social supports, and plan for not having a plan, which requires flexibility, decision-making skills, and trusted sources of information that function in the face of unknowns. \item[Definition:] Resilience is ``a process linking a set of adaptive capacities to a positive trajectory of functioning and adaption after a disturbance.'' \item[Quotes:] \begin{itemize} \item ``Looking back, one wonders if perhapse the social and psychological sciences should have created their own language, free from inherited meanings, but the term is probably here to stay.'' \item ``Although there are exceptions, most discussions, if not the definitions themselves, distinquish resilience from ``resistance.'' In mathematics and technology, resistance refers to the force required to displace the system from equilibrium, whereas resilience refers to the time required for the system to return to equilibrium once displaced (Bodin and Wiman 2004).'' \end{itemize} \end{description}}

The advancement in modern vehicular systems provides many benefits such as reducing traffic congestion and improving safety and fuel economy via vehicular networks.

This paper provides in-depth explanation of CAN bus and feasible scenarios where a vehicle is no longer safe after its CAN bus is compromised. Furthermore, the inclusion of CAN bus attacking codes in a mobile malware is cost-effective for the malicious attackers but very challenging for vehicle engineers to mitigate the security risks. Based on a variety of security attacks, we analyze potential  attacks and their impact on the safety of the vehicle users. A number of vulnerabilities and attack scenarios are exposed which allows malicious attackers to hamper the vehicular control systems and cause harm to the vehicle even the passengers. In this paper, we do not report on our own implementation of attacks on real vehicles; our aim is to motivate further research to improve the security of the modern vehicular systems.\\ \newline \textbf{Notes:} \begin{itemize} \item Provides a list of attack approaches in table 1. \item Section 3.2 provides a list of attack scenarios. \item Table 2 provides a list of possible solutions. \end{itemize}}

In organizations, strategic planning is a constructive context for resilience. \item Resilience is not simple survival, bounce-back, or homeostasis. The resilient organization uses disturbance to learn and transform toward greater success. (Thus, entropic formulae can measure probably precursors of resilience, but not resilient behavior itself.) \item Foresight (preparedness) is an essential part of resilience. \item The resilient organization or community is skilled also at response, recovery, development, prevention, and mitigation, clearly delineating the tasks within each of these. \end{enumerate} \item[Notes:] This is a classic example of a persuasive definition. The authors lament the confusion about the definition of resilience in the literature, and then add a new definition focused on growth and learning which the lexical definition will not support. \end{description}}

First, we define what is meant by a concept, describe the functions served by concepts in scientific endeavors, and identify problems associated with a lack of conceptual clarity.  Then we explain why it is so difficult to adequately define concepts.  Next, we provide a series of recommendations for scholars in the organizational, behavioral, and social sciences who are either trying to define a new concept or revise the definition of one that already exists in the field. Following this, we provide some examples that generally meet the criteria for a good conceptual definition.  We conclude with a set of questions that authors, reviewers, and editors can use as a guide for evaluating concept definitions.\\ \newline \textbf{Notes:} The authors provide a process for creating a ``good'' definition, and a list 10 questions that can be used to evaluate a definition.}

Unfortunately, many state drought plans utilize operational drought definitions that are derived subjectively and therefore may not be appropriate for triggering drought responses. This paper presents an objective methodology for establishing operational drought definitions. The advantages of this methodology are demonstrated by calculating meteorological drought thresholds for the Palmer drought severity index, the standardized precipitation index, and percent of normal precipitation using both station and climate division data from Texas. Results indicate that using subjectively derived operational drought definitions may lead to over- or underestimating true drought severity. Therefore, it is more appropriate to use an objective location-specific method for defining operational drought thresholds.\\ \newline \textbf{Notes:}}

The key conclusion from this research is that the term is highly ambiguous, it is used for different purposes in different contexts and in some cases the understandings of the term are diametrically opposed.

At the conceptual level, there is the need to identify resilient actions, including those that may seem to violate established norms, such as rational behavior. At the operational level, it may be difficult to model individual, group, and community behavior in a single framework. At the empirical level, it is especially difficult to gather data on resilience to specify models. The purpose of this paper is to summarize progress on all three planes. First, defines several important dimensions of economic resilience to disasters. Second, shows how computable general equilibrium modeling represents a useful framework for analyzing the behavior of individuals, businesses, and markets. Third, summarizes recent progress in the conceptual and empirical modeling of resilience, including the incorporation of disequilibria and the recalibration of key behavioral parameters on the basis of empirical data. Fourth, uses the results of a case study to illustrate some important issues relating to the subject. \item[Quotes:] \begin{itemize} \item Economic resilience, as defined in this paper, refers to the inherent and adaptive responses to disasters that enable individuals and communities to avoid some potential losses. \item In general, static economic resilience refers to the ability or capacity of a system to absorb or cushion against damage or loss (see, for example, Holling, 1973; Perrings, 2001). A more general definition that incorporates dynamic considerations, including stability, is the ability of a system to recover from a severe shock. We distinguish two types of resilience:\\ (1) inherent -- ability under normal circumstances (e.g. the ability to substitute other inputs for those curtailed by an external shock, or the ability of markets to reallocate resources in response to price signals); and\\ (2) adaptive -- ability in crisis situations due to ingenuity or extra effort (e.g. increasing input substitution possibilities in individual business operations, or strengthening the market by providing information to match suppliers without customers to customers without suppliers). \end{itemize} \end{description}}

It can be viewed as a handbook for achieving the identified cyber resiliency outcomes based on a systems engineering perspective on system life cycle processes in conjunction with risk management processes, allowing the experience and expertise of the organization to help determine what is correct for its purpose. Organizations can select, adapt, and use some or all of the cyber resiliency constructs (i.e., objectives, techniques, approaches, and design principles) described in this publication and apply the constructs to the technical, operational, and threat environments for which systems need to be engineered. The system life cycle processes and cyber resiliency constructs can be used for new systems, system upgrades, or repurposed systems; can be employed at any stage of the system life cycle; and can take advantage of any system or software development methodology including, for example, waterfall, spiral, or agile. The processes and associated cyber resiliency constructs can also be applied recursively, iteratively, concurrently, sequentially, or in parallel and to any system regardless of its size, complexity, purpose, scope, environment of operation, or special nature. The full extent of the application of the content in this publication is guided and informed by stakeholder protection needs, mission assurance needs, and concerns with cost, schedule, and performance. The tailorable nature of the engineering activities and tasks and the system life cycle processes ensure that systems resulting from the application of the security and cyber resiliency design principles, among others, have the level of trustworthiness deemed sufficient to protect stakeholders from suffering unacceptable losses of their assets and associated consequences. Trustworthiness is made possible, in part, by the rigorous application of the security and cyber resiliency design principles, constructs, and concepts within a structured set of systems life cycle processes that provides the necessary traceability of requirements, transparency, and evidence to support risk-informed decision-making and trades.\\ \newline \textbf{Notes:} \textit{Cyber resilience} is defined as ``the ability to anticipate, withstand, recover from, and adapt to adverse conditions.''\\ \newline \textit{Focus:}\\ \begin{itemize} \item on the mission or business functions, \item on the effects of the Advanced Persistent Threat, \item assume the adversary will compromise or breach the system or organization, \item assume the adversary will maintain a presence in the system or ogranization. \end{itemize} \textit{Strategies:} anticipate, withstand, recover, adapt.\\ \newline \textit{Objectives:} prevent or avoid, prepare, continue, constrain, reconstitute, understand, transform, re-architect.\\ \newline \textit{Techniques:} adaptive response, analytic monitoring, contextual awareness, coordinated protection, deception, diversity, dynamic positioning, non-persistence, privilege restriction, realignment, redundancy, segmentation, substantiated integrity, unpredictability.}

The notion captures two intuitive aims of robustness: bounded disturbances have bounded effects and the consequences of a sporadic disturbance disappear over time. We present a design methodology for robust CPS which is based on an abstraction and refinement process. We suggest several novel notions of simulation relations to ensure the soundness of the approach. In addition, we show how such simulation relations can be constructed compositionally.

There are two groups of cyber metrics working-level metrics that aim to counter an adversarys cyber operations and institutional-level metrics that aim to capture any cyber-related organizational deficiencies.  The cyber environment is dynamic and complex, the threat is ubiquitous in peacetime and wartime, deployed and at home, and no set of underlying laws of nature govern the cyber realm. A fruitful approach is to define cyber metrics in the context of a two-player cyber game between Red the attacking side and Blue the side trying to ensure a mission.  Reds strategy and tactics will be shaped by its assessment of Blues posture and weaknesses.  Likewise, Blues posture will be shaped by an expectation of what threats Red poses.  Both will continually evolve.  No forethought by Blue, no matter how carefully done, will suffice in anticipating all of the possible moves Red might take in the future.  Blue will need to use static countermeasures based on known best practices cybersecurity, as well as adaptive, dynamic actions to respond to Red in real time cyber resiliency.  Both of these dimensions of cyber metrics need to span nearly the entire scope of the enterprise to capture the full range of concerns.  To measure how survivable and effective a mission or system can be in a cyber-contested environment, we must understand how well Red cyber operations are being countered.  Therefore, the focus of cyber metrics must be on Reds estimated success or failure, not on the specific countermeasures that Blue might try.  Blue countermeasures are important, of course, but their importance is as a means to an endthat of hindering or thwarting Red.\\ \newline \textbf{Notes:}}

The term is a ``boundary object'': it has multiple definitions which do not necessarily correspond. While this slippery state can serve to unite different actors, it can also be co-opted by government to twist transformative adaptation into maintaining the status quo. We compared the definitions of resilience between two datasets: the conclusions and responses to the Canadian government's recent inquiries into climate change and agriculture, and semistructured interviews with small-scale farmers in the Canadian Maritimes (n = 37). The differences between the two suggest that government institutions may be creating policy which perpetuates status quo industrial agriculture without acknowledging farmers' differing conceptions of climate resilience for the food system. The findings highlight the need for the definition of resilience in climate and agriculture policy to be problematized and diversified. It corroborates the calls in adaptation theory for resilience to be understood as a normative term rather than a politically neutral one; and for broader inclusion of concerned stakeholders in consultations. \item[Quotes:] \begin{itemize} \item ``It should not be controversial to suggest that the word `resilience' is overused to the point of confusion.'' \item ``Scott (2013) helpfully typologizes these two goals as `equilibrium resilience' and `evolutionary resilience'.''\cite{scott2013resilience} \item ``The tension between these two ways of imagining resilience, a term which itself comes from physics by way of the natural sciences (Scott, 2013)\cite{scott2013resilience}, is characteristic of the boundary object the term has become. A boundary object is a `term that facilitates communication across disciplinary borders by creating shared vocabulary although the understanding of the parties would differ regarding the precise meaning of the term in question.'''\cite{brand2007focusing} \item ``The persistence of some boundary objects has led some to characterize them as \textit{panchestrons}: an `explanation or theory [\ldots{}] made to fit all cases, being used in such a variety of ways as to become meaningless' (Lindenmayer and Fischer, 2007)\cite{lindenmayer2007tackling}. Brand and Jax (2007) point out that the specific meaning of the term `resilience' is increasingly unclear; that it is used ambiguously, with diverging definitions; that its original definition is about to vanish; and that resilience is increasingly considered as a perspective rather than a concept.'' \end{itemize} \end{description}}

Information collected had a significant bias towards HD vehicles (class 7/8), as opposed to MD vehicles. This was due to the discovery process yielding very limited data on MD vehicles (class 3 to 6). This directly correlates to the types of responses provided by industry experts and their cybersecurity concerns (mainly by heavy truck OEMs and suppliers). Much focus was centered around their higher electronic content products that typically occur on class 7/8 vehicle platforms. Often, stakeholder feedback indicated that MD trucks have similar vulnerabilities to either light-duty or heavy-duty trucks but not necessarily anything particularly unique to that segment. This generality likely originates from the similarities between MD truck architectures/designs and HD truck architectures. The objective is to develop a framework to understand common features and differences between passenger vehicle and heavy-duty vehicle cybersecurity in terms of lifecycle, threats and risks, electrical/electronic architectures, control applications, security countermeasures, and industry aspects. Considering recent public awareness of passenger vehicle cybersecurity vulnerabilities, NHTSA undertook this research to understand potential impacts in the heavy-truck vehicle domain. This task started with the investigation of heavy-vehicle cybersecurity practices by contrasting the passenger vehicle cybersecurity knowledge-base to that of heavy vehicles. The project next considered risks in a more generic manner, and identified possible mitigation mechanisms. The comparison framework developed in this document was leveraged to help indemnify the possible mitigation mechanisms. The investigation and data gathering concentrated efforts on issues that affect vehicle safety, but not necessarily asset protection.\\ \newline \textbf{Notes:}}

With the objective of developing a robustness theory for CPS, we introduce a notion of robustness for cyber systems inspired by existing notions of input-output stability in control theory. We show that the proposed notion of robustness captures two intuitive goals: bounded disturbances lead to bounded deviations from nominal behavior, and the effect of a sporadic disturbance disappears in finitely many steps. For cyber systems modeled as finite-state transducers, the proposed notion of robustness can be verified in pseudo-polynomial time. The synthesis problem, consisting of designing a controller enforcing robustness, can also be solved in pseudo-polynomial time.\\ \newline \textbf{Notes:}},

Cybersecurity frameworks and models formulated to mitigate these risks are typically framed from the organizational perspective of governments and the private sector. Further, they are traditionally techno-centric solutions framed from a cybersecurity perspective towards prevention of risks; only recently are they incorporating resilience perspectives towards anticipation of risks and positive adaptation during adverse cyber incidents. This research makes advances on human-centric cyber resilience - from the perspective of citizens and centered on citizens' multi-dimensional experience of adverse cyber incidents. It considers the goal of cyber resilience, from the capabilitarian perspective, as enhancing the cyber capabilities of individuals and achieving positive adaptation in the face of adverse cyber incidents. This paper presents an ontology that is formulated to formalize individuals' cyber resilience. The paper motivates the need for such an ontology and discusses the constitutive concepts. Finally, it shows how this ontology can support the realization of cyber resilience for individual citizens.},

        \textbf{Abstract:} This study develops the need for formal conceptual definitions (sometimes called nominal definitions) and how to develop better measurement instruments for theory-building. It develops the underlying theory for `good' formal conceptual definitions by defining terms, demonstrating that formal conceptual definitions are needed for all theory-building empirical research, explains how and why `good' formal conceptual definitions are used to develop properties and their measures, and last, it logically explains that good formal conceptual definitions are necessary conditions for construct validity (content validity, criterion validity, convergent validity, and discriminant validity) while statistical tests are sufficient conditions for validity. This theory development explains why formal conceptual definitions are necessary before any traditional statistical empirical validity tests are performed. This study suggests that any statistical validity tests are not meaningful if the concept is not formally defined.

        In short, the theory of formal conceptual definitions provides a structure to develop `good' measures of the formal theory that leads to `good' empirical theory-building.\\

        \newline \textbf{Notes:} He list the qualities of a ``good'' definition: inclusivity, exclusivity, differentiability, clarity, communicability, consistency, and parsimony.(Hemple 1970)\\ \newline ``Consequently, it is generally accepted in the academic community that dictionary or commonly used definitions are not sufficient for scientific study.'' (Bunge, 1967; Hunt, 1991; Teas and Palan 1997)\\ Lists 8 rules for ``good'' formal definitions: \begin{description} \item[Rule 1:] Definitions should be formally defined using primitive and derived terms. Formal conceptual definitions should differentiate between formal concepts and non-formal measurable terms. All definitions should follow the `rule of replacement' \item[Rule 2:] Each concept should be uniquely defined. It should exclude (as many as possible) shared terms with other definitions to reduce confusion with related concepts. This rule means that the formal conceptual definitions denotation matches as closely as possible match its connotation \item[Rule 3:] Definitions should include only unambiguous and clear terms. Put another way, do not use vague or ambiguous terms \item[Rule 4:] Definitions should have as few as possible terms in the conceptual definition to avoid violating the parsimony virtue of `good' theory \item[Rule 5:] Definitions should be consistent within the production/operations management field. That is, formal conceptual definitions should be the similar as possible between studies \item[Rule 6:] Definitions should not make any term broader. New definitions should not expand the concept to make it broader and less exclusive \item[Rule 7:] New hypotheses cannot be introduced in the definitions. In production/operations management, the definitions should not include instances where only `good' events happen \item[Rule 8:] Statistical tests for content validity must be performed after the terms are formally defined. These empirical tests are not tests of the conceptual validity of a concept but rather are used to test if the formally defined concepts sample the conceptual domain \end{description}

The report summarizes the current, accepted definitions of resiliency factors contributing to resiliency theories of resiliency empirical research findings on resiliency in protecting individuals from adverse outcomes associated with acute or chronic stress empirical research findings on resiliency in military personnel and other high-risk occupations and resiliency measures, their development and validation. Existing definitions implicate resiliency with the ability to adapt and successfully cope with adversity, life stressors, and traumatic events. However, findings from this review demonstrate the lack of a uniform or accepted definition of resiliency. Research to date has resulted in the identification of several individual traits and environmental situations that are contributing factors to resiliency, and this has led to recent efforts to develop and validate emerging interactive resiliency factor models. The theoretical bases of resiliency remain controversial and many existing theories have received modest empirical investigation. Furthermore, the methodologies used in many of these conceptually based studies are poor and results are limited in their generalizability. Empirical research on protective factors remains limited, and their inter-relationships to risk factors and exposure factors remains unclear. Relatively few studies have investigated resiliency in military populations. These studies have primarily investigated protective factors among resilient individuals who have experienced combat exposure e.g., prisoners of war. Yet, much more is to be learned about resiliency across the range of military personnel experiences e.g., peacekeepers. Lastly, the review identifies numerous measures of resiliency, and of related constructs, many of which lack sufficient validation. \end{description}}

The three basic patterns are (1) decompensation -- when the system exhausts its capacity to adapt as disturbances / challenges cascade; (2) working at cross-purposes -- when roles exhibit behaviour that is locally adaptive but globally mal-adaptive; and (3) getting stuck in outdated behaviours -- when the system over-relies on past successes.

The three basic patterns are (1) decompensation -- when the system exhausts its capacity to adapt as disturbances / challenges cascade; (2) working at cross-purposes -- when roles exhibit behaviour that is locally adaptive but globally mal-adaptive; and (3) getting stuck in outdated behaviours -- when the system over-relies on past successes.

Clarifying the technical meanings and foundations of the concept of resilience would appear to be necessary. Proposals for defining resilience are flourishing as well. This paper organizes the different technical approaches to the question of what is resilience and how to engineer it in complex adaptive systems. This paper groups the different uses of the label `resilience' around four basic concepts: (1) resilience as rebound from trauma and return to equilibrium; (2) resilience as a synonym for robustness; (3) resilience as the opposite of brittleness, i.e., as graceful extensibility when surprise challenges boundaries; (4) resilience as network architectures that can sustain the ability to adapt to future surprises as conditions evolve.\\ \newline \textbf{Notes:}}

Resilience is now an integral part of human society and has become a hot topic in different research domains. As an interdisciplinary discipline, resilience science is supported by multidisciplinary knowledge. Although research and practical work of resilience have been developed significantly, it is still unclear that how far resilience science has been progressed as a scientific discipline. In order to reveal the connotation and knowledge structure of resilience science, we systematically reviewed classic publications on resilience and compared its definitions and related research in different discipline domains. The evolution trend of resilience science was quantitatively analyzed to identify its knowledge foundation, geographic distribution, academic community, and collaboration structure. This analysis revealed the knowledge structure and development path of resilience science for future researchers. The results showed that the publications of resilience have been explosively increased since the 2000s. The developed countries made sound contributions to the research of resilience science, and China also presents a significant growth trend in this area. The collaborative relationship is becoming closer across research institutions and scholars. The research topics of resilience have been changing in the latest 30 years. The results reveal important highlights and future research directions of resilience science on academic domains including definition of resilience, measurement methods of network resilience, and mechanisms to forming resilient status. Moreover, this study will help researchers in resilience science for future collaboration and work. \item[Notes] \begin{itemize} \item ``The definitions of resilience in different categories are all derived from the ecology domain (Holling 1973; Hosseini et al. 2016). The core connotation is that resilience reflects the ability of system to maintain or rapidly return to desired functional status in the face of a disturbance, to adapt to change, and to quickly transform systems that limit current or future adaptive capacity (Lozupone et al. 2012; Meerow et al. 2016)'' \item ``The definition of resilience is still an important research area.'' \item ``Summarizing the definition of resilience in social and ecological domain, engineering and disaster domain, and economic and organziational behavior domain.'' \end{itemize} \end{description}}

Many definitions of resilience have been proposed in order to cover different contexts. However, they are mostly derived either from the ecological or the engineering definitions of resilience, which substantially differ between each other. Here, following the strategy for measuring the system perturbations by the return period of their impacts on production (or equivalently by the inverse frequency), I demonstrate the mathematical equivalence of the ecological and engineering definitions of resilience for a special class of production systems. These finding provides additional robustness to resilience assessments based on the recently proposed annual production resilience indicator. \end{description}}

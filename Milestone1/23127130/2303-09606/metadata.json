    "abstract": "Many Android applications collect data from users. When they do, they must protect this collected data according to the current legal frameworks. Such data protection has become even more important since the European Union rolled out the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). App developers have limited tool support to reason about data protection throughout their app development process. Although many Android applications state a privacy policy, privacy policy compliance checks are currently manual, expensive, and prone to error. One of the major challenges in privacy audits is the significant gap between legal privacy statements (in English text) and technical measures that Android apps use to protect their user's privacy. In this thesis, we will explore to what extent we can use static analysis to answer important questions regarding data protection. Our main goal is to design a tool based approach that aids app developers and auditors in ensuring data protection in Android applications, based on automated static program analysis.",

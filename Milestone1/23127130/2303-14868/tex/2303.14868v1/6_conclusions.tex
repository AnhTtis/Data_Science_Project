We discuss the fundamental perspective problem of prior work in developing privacy attacks against FL when secure aggregation is used. Attacking the aggregate update as a single large-batch leads to unnecessary resource overheads incurred by clients. By treating the aggregate update as an aggregation of individual client updates we can use parameter sparsity, decreasing the model size by $327\times$ and the computation time by $3.3\times$ compared to SOTA while maintaining the same leakage rate even through SA. We also show the challenge of maintaining sparsity through SA when the client sends the update back to the server and of scaling and leaking large input image sizes.

    "abstract": "Ultrafast nonlinear optical phenomena in solids have been attracting major interest as novel methodologies for femtosecond spectroscopy of electron dynamics and control of material properties. Here, we theoretically investigate strong-field nonlinear optical transitions in a prototypical two-dimensional material, hBN, and show that the k-resolved conduction band charge occupation patterns induced by an elliptically-polarized laser can be understood in a multi-photon resonant picture; but remarkably, only if using the Floquet light-dressed states instead of the undressed matter states. Consequently, our work establishes a direct measurable signature for band-dressing in nonlinear optical processes in solids, and opens new paths for ultrafast spectroscopy and valley manipulation.",

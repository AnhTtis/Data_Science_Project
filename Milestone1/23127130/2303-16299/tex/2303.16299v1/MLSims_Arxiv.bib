	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03529},
	abstract = {Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are increasingly prevalent in education research, and are often regarded as a gold standard of causal inference. Two main virtues of randomized experiments are that they (1) do not suffer from confounding, thereby allowing for an unbiased estimate of an intervention's causal impact, and (2) allow for design-based inference, meaning that the physical act of randomization largely justifies the statistical assumptions made. However, RCT sample sizes are often small, leading to low precision; in many cases RCT estimates may be too imprecise to guide policy or inform science. Observational studies, by contrast, have strengths and weaknesses complementary to those of RCTs. Observational studies typically offer much larger sample sizes, but may suffer confounding. In many contexts, experimental and observational data exist side by side, allowing the possibility of integrating "big observational data" with "small but high-quality experimental data" to get the best of both. Such approaches hold particular promise in the field of education, where RCT sample sizes are often small due to cost constraints, but automatic collection of observational data, such as in computerized educational technology applications, or in state longitudinal data systems (SLDS) with administrative data on hundreds of thousand of students, has made rich, high-dimensional observational data widely available. We outline an approach that allows one to employ machine learning algorithms to learn from the observational data, and use the resulting models to improve precision in randomized experiments. Importantly, there is no requirement that the machine learning models are "correct" in any sense, and the final experimental results are guaranteed to be exactly unbiased. Thus, there is no danger of confounding biases in the observational data leaking into the experiment.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09676},
	abstract = {There has been an increase in interest in experimental evaluations to estimate causal eﬀects, partly because their internal validity tends to be high. At the same time, as part of the big data revolution, large, detailed, and representative, administrative data sets have become more widely available. However, the credibility of estimates of causal eﬀects based on such data sets alone can be low. In this paper, we develop statistical methods for systematically combining experimental and observational data to obtain credible estimates of the causal eﬀect of a binary treatment on a primary outcome that we only observe in the observational sample. Both the observational and experimental samples contain data about a treatment, observable individual characteristics, and a secondary (often short term) outcome. To estimate the eﬀect of a treatment on the primary outcome while addressing the potential confounding in the observational sample, we propose a method that makes use of estimates of the relationship between the treatment and the secondary outcome from the experimental sample. If assignment to the treatment in the observational sample were unconfounded, we would expect the treatment eﬀects on the secondary outcome in the two samples to be similar. We interpret diﬀerences in the estimated causal eﬀects on the secondary outcome between the two samples as evidence of unobserved confounders in the observational sample, and develop control function methods for using those diﬀerences to adjust the estimates of the treatment eﬀects on the primary outcome. We illustrate these ideas by combining data on class size and third grade test scores from the Project STAR experiment with observational data on class size and both third and eighth grade test scores from the New York school system.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.15012},
	abstract = {Data from both a randomized trial and an observational study are sometimes simultaneously available for evaluating the eﬀect of an intervention. The randomized data typically allows for reliable estimation of average treatment eﬀects but may be limited in sample size and patient heterogeneity for estimating conditional average treatment eﬀects for a broad range of patients. Estimates from the observational study can potentially compensate for these limitations, but there may be concerns about whether confounding and treatment effect heterogeneity have been adequately addressed. We propose an approach for combining conditional treatment eﬀect estimators from each source such that it aggressively weights toward the randomized estimator when bias in the observational estimator is detected. This allows the combination to be consistent for a conditional causal eﬀect, regardless of whether assumptions required for consistent estimation in the observational study are satisﬁed. When the bias is negligible, the estimators from each source are combined for optimal eﬃciency. We show the problem can be formulated as a penalized least squares problem and consider its asymptotic properties. Simulations demonstrate the robustness and eﬃciency of the method in ﬁnite samples, in scenarios with bias or no bias in the observational estimator. We illustrate the method by estimating the eﬀects of hormone replacement therapy on the risk of developing coronary heart disease in data from the Women’s Health Initiative.},

	abstract = {With increasing data availability, causal treatment effects can be evaluated across different datasets, both randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies. RCTs isolate the effect of the treatment from that of unwanted (confounding) co-occurring effects. But they may struggle with inclusion biases, and thus lack external validity. On the other hand, large observational samples are often more representative of the target population but can conflate confounding effects with the treatment of interest. In this paper, we review the growing literature on methods for causal inference on combined RCTs and observational studies, striving for the best of both worlds. We first discuss identification and estimation methods that improve generalizability of RCTs using the representativeness of observational data. Classical estimators include weighting, difference between conditional outcome models, and doubly robust estimators. We then discuss methods that combine RCTs and observational data to improve (conditional) average treatment effect estimation, handling possible unmeasured confounding in the observational data. We also connect and contrast works developed in both the potential outcomes framework and the structural causal model framework. Finally, we compare the main methods using a simulation study and real world data to analyze the effect of tranexamic acid on the mortality rate in major trauma patients. Code to implement many of the methods is provided.},

They can also be extended to study comparative effectiveness, testing which of several alternative interventions is expected to have the strongest effect. This often requires network meta-analysis (NMA), which combines trials involving direct comparison of two interventions within the same trial and indirect comparisons across trials. In this paper, we extend existing network methods for main effects to examining moderator effects, allowing for tests of whether intervention effects vary for different populations or when employed in different contexts. In addition, we study how the use of individual participant data (IPD) may increase the sensitivity of NMA for detecting moderator effects, as compared to aggregate data NMA that employs study-level effect sizes in a meta-regression framework. A new network metaanalysis diagram is proposed. We also develop a generalized multilevel model for NMA that takes into account within- and between-trial heterogeneity, and can include participant-level covariates.},

	abstract = {Network meta-analysis (NMA) is a common approach to summarizing relative treatment effects from randomized trials with different treatment comparisons. Most NMAs are based on published aggregate data (AD) and have limited possibilities for investigating the extent of network consistency and between-study heterogeneity. Given that individual participant data (IPD) are considered the gold standard in evidence synthesis, we explored statistical methods for IPD-NMA and investigated their potential advantages and limitations, compared with AD-NMA. We discuss several one-stage random-effects NMA models that account for within-trial imbalances, treatment effect modifiers, missing response data and longitudinal responses. We illustrate all models in a case study of 18 antidepressant trials with a continuous endpoint (the Hamilton Depression Score). All trials suffered from drop-out; missingness of longitudinal responses ranged from 21 to 41\% after 6 weeks follow-up. Our results indicate that NMA based on IPD may lead to increased precision of estimated treatment effects. Furthermore, it can help to improve network consistency and explain between-study heterogeneity by adjusting for participant-level effect modifiers and adopting more advanced models for dealing with missing response data. We conclude that implementation of IPD-NMA should be considered when trials are affected by substantial drop-out rate, and when treatment effects are potentially influenced by participant-level covariates.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03529},
	abstract = {Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are increasingly prevalent in education research, and are often regarded as a gold standard of causal inference. Two main virtues of randomized experiments are that they (1) do not suffer from confounding, thereby allowing for an unbiased estimate of an intervention's causal impact, and (2) allow for design-based inference, meaning that the physical act of randomization largely justifies the statistical assumptions made. However, RCT sample sizes are often small, leading to low precision; in many cases RCT estimates may be too imprecise to guide policy or inform science. Observational studies, by contrast, have strengths and weaknesses complementary to those of RCTs. Observational studies typically offer much larger sample sizes, but may suffer confounding. In many contexts, experimental and observational data exist side by side, allowing the possibility of integrating "big observational data" with "small but high-quality experimental data" to get the best of both. Such approaches hold particular promise in the field of education, where RCT sample sizes are often small due to cost constraints, but automatic collection of observational data, such as in computerized educational technology applications, or in state longitudinal data systems (SLDS) with administrative data on hundreds of thousand of students, has made rich, high-dimensional observational data widely available. We outline an approach that allows one to employ machine learning algorithms to learn from the observational data, and use the resulting models to improve precision in randomized experiments. Importantly, there is no requirement that the machine learning models are "correct" in any sense, and the final experimental results are guaranteed to be exactly unbiased. Thus, there is no danger of confounding biases in the observational data leaking into the experiment.},

	abstract = {We propose a method for aggregating evidence from observational studies, which may be subject to internal selection bias, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which may be subject to site selection bias. We show that it is possible to nonparametrically debias both types of studies using an Instrumental Variables (IV) strategy, and thus uncover the true population distribution of treatment effects for complier studies. As we often have a small number of studies, imperfect instruments, and only observe study results with error, parametric hierarchical Bayesian models work well in practice. Our specific implementation uses the establishment of a facilitating organisation such as the Jameel Poverty Action Lab or Innovations for Poverty Action in a location using a novel Differences in Differences “Plausibly Exogenous” IV model. Unlike alternative approaches, our model is point-identifying and yields a Wald Estimator representation of the local average treatment effect (LATE) for compliers. Applying this strategy to applications in Conditional Cash Transfers (CCTs) and Microcredit shows substantial internal selection bias in observational studies of CCTs and much less bias for Microcredit; neither application shows evidence of RCT site selection bias, though credible intervals are wide.},

I outline three estimators (weighting, shrinkage, or GMM) for implementing this strategy, and show that my methods can reduce variance by up to 50\% in typical experimental designs; therefore, only half of the experimental sample is required to attain the same statistical precision. If researchers are allowed to design experiments diﬀerently, I show that they can further improve the precision by directly leveraging this correlation between characteristics and assignment. I apply my method to a search listing dataset from Expedia that studies the causal eﬀect of search rankings, and show that the method can substantially improve the precision.},

We develop a federated adaptive causal estimation (FACE) framework to incorporate heterogeneous data from multiple sites to provide treatment eﬀect estimation and inference for a target population of interest. Our strategy is communication-eﬃcient and privacy-preserving and allows for ﬂexibility in the speciﬁcation of the target population. Our method accounts for site-level heterogeneity in the distribution of covariates through density ratio weighting. To safely aggregate estimates from all sites and avoid negative transfer, we introduce an adaptive procedure of weighing the estimators constructed using data from the target and source populations through a penalized regression on the inﬂuence functions, which achieves 1) consistency and 2) optimal eﬃciency. We illustrate FACE by conducting a comparative eﬀectiveness study of BNT162b2 (Pﬁzer) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccines on COVID-19 outcomes in U.S. veterans using electronic health records from ﬁve VA sites.},

	abstract = {Objectives. Bayesian statistical methods are increasingly popular as a tool for meta-analysis of clinical trial data involving both direct and indirect treatment comparisons. However, appropriate selection of prior distributions for unknown model parameters and checking of consistency assumptions required for modeling remain particularly challenging. We compared Bayesian and traditional frequentist statistical methods for mixed treatment comparisons with multiple binary outcomes. Data. We searched major electronic bibliographic databases, Food and Drug Administration reviews, trial registries, and research grant databases up to December 2011 to find randomized studies published in English that examined drugs for female urgency urinary incontinence (UI) on continence, improvement in UI, and treatment discontinuation due to harm. Methods. We describe and fit fixed and random effects models in both Bayesian and frequentist statistical frameworks. In a hierarchical model of 8 treatments, we separately analyze 1 safety and 2 efficacy outcomes. We produce Bayesian and frequentist treatment ranks and odds ratios across all drug v placebo comparisons, as well as Bayesian probabilities that each drug is best overall through a weighted scoring rule that trades off efficacy and safety. Results. In our study, Bayesian and frequentist random effects models generally suggest the same drugs as most attractive, although neither suggests any significant differences between drugs. However, the Bayesian methods more consistently identify one drug (propiverine) as best overall, produce interval estimates that are generally better at capturing all sources of uncertainty in the data, and also permit attractive “rankograms” that visually capture the probability that each drug assumes each possible rank. Conclusions. Bayesian methods are more flexible and their results more clinically interpretable, but they require more careful development and specialized software.},

In this framework, the optimal weights, minimizing the quadratic loss, are entirely determined by the mean squared error matrix of the vector of initial estimators. The averaging estimator is built using an estimation of this matrix, which can be computed from the same dataset. A non-asymptotic error bound on the averaging estimator is derived, leading to asymptotic optimality under mild conditions on the estimated mean squared error matrix.

Unfortunately, evidence of real world effectiveness for new interventions is not available at the time of initial approval. To bridge this gap, statistical methods are available to extend the estimated treatment effect observed in a RCT to a target population. The generalization is done by weighting the subjects who participated in a RCT so that the weighted trial population resembles a target population. We evaluate a variety of alternative estimation and weight construction procedures using both simulations and a real world data example using two clinical trials of an investigational intervention for Alzheimer's disease. Our results suggest an optimal approach to estimation depends on the characteristics of source and target populations, including degree of selection bias and treatment effect heterogeneity.},

However, this task is statistically challenging and typically requires large amounts of data. Investigators may be interested in using the individual patient data from multiple studies to estimate these treatment effect models. Our data arise from a systematic review of observational studies contrasting different treatments for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, where multiple antimicrobial agents are taken concurrently to cure the infection. We propose a marginal structural model for effect modiﬁcation by different patient characteristics and co-medications in a meta-analysis of observational individual patient data. We develop, evaluate, and apply a targeted maximum likelihood estimator for the doubly robust estimation of the parameters of the proposed marginal structural model in this context.

First, we use observational time series data to estimate a mapping from covariates to unit-level eﬀects. These estimates are likely biased but under some conditions the bias preserves unit-level relative rank orderings. If these conditions hold, we only need suﬃcient experimental data to identify a monotonic, one-dimensional transformation from observationally predicted treatment eﬀects to real treatment eﬀects.

To derive combined estimators with desirable properties, we make use of results from the Stein Shrinkage literature. Our contributions are threefold. First, we propose a generic procedure for deriving shrinkage estimators in this setting, making use of a generalized unbiased risk estimate. Second, we develop two new estimators, prove finite sample conditions under which they have lower risk than an estimator using only experimental data, and show that each achieves a notion of asymptotic optimality.

However, it is unclear whether the aggregation of eﬀect estimates across heterogeneous populations will be consistent for a meaningful parameter when not all treatments are evaluated on each population. Drawing from counterfactual theory and the causal inference framework, we deﬁne the population of interest in a network meta-analysis and deﬁne the target parameter under a series of nonparametric structural assumptions. This allows us to determine the requirements for identiﬁability of this parameter, enabling a description of the conditions under which network meta-analysis is appropriate and when it might mislead decision making. We then adapt several modeling strategies from the causal inference literature to obtain consistent estimation of the intervention-speciﬁc mean outcome and model-independent contrasts between treatments. Finally, we perform a reanalysis of a systematic review to compare the eﬀicacy of antibiotics on suspected or conﬁrmed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in hospitalized patients.},

	abstract = {Meta-analysis of individual patient data (IPD) is increasingly used to synthesize data from multiple trials. IPD meta-analysis offers several advantages over meta-analyzing aggregate data, including the capacity to individualize treatment recommendations. Trials usually collect information on many patient characteristics. Some of these covariates may strongly interact with treatment (and thus be associated with treatment effect modification) while others may have little effect. It is currently unclear whether a systematic approach to the selection of treatment-covariate interactions in an IPD meta-analysis can lead to better estimates of patient-specific treatment effects. We aimed to answer this question by comparing in simulations the standard approach to IPD meta-analysis (no variable selection, all treatment-covariate interactions included in the model) with six alternative methods: stepwise regression, and five regression methods that perform shrinkage on treatment-covariate interactions, that is, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), ridge, adaptive LASSO, Bayesian LASSO, and stochastic search variable selection. Exploring a range of scenarios, we found that shrinkage methods performed well for both continuous and dichotomous outcomes, for a variety of settings. In most scenarios, these methods gave lower mean squared error of the patient-specific treatment effect as compared with the standard approach and stepwise regression. We illustrate the application of these methods in two datasets from cardiology and psychiatry. We recommend that future IPD meta-analysis that aim to estimate patient-specific treatment effects using multiple effect modifiers should use shrinkage methods, whereas stepwise regression should be avoided.},

	abstract = {Inferences from different data sources can often be fused together, a process referred to as “fusion learning,” to yield more powerful findings than those from individual data sources alone. Effective fusion learning approaches are in growing demand as increasing number of data sources have become easily available in this big data era. This article proposes a new fusion learning approach, called “iFusion,” for drawing efficient individualized inference by fusing learnings from relevant data sources. Specifically, iFusion (i) summarizes inferences from individual data sources as individual confidence distributions (CDs); (ii) forms a clique of individuals that bear relevance to the target individual and then combines the CDs from those relevant individuals; and, finally, (iii) draws inference for the target individual from the combined CD. In essence, iFusion strategically “borrows strength” from relevant individuals to enhance the efficiency of the target individual inference while preserving its validity. This article focuses on the setting where each individual study has a number of observations but its inference can be further improved by incorporating additional information from similar studies that is referred to as its clique. Under the setting, iFusion is shown to achieve oracle property under suitable conditions. It is also shown to be flexible and robust in handling heterogeneity arising from diverse data sources. The development is ideally suited for goaldirected applications. Computationally, iFusion is parallel in nature and scales up easily for big data. An efficient scalable algorithm is provided for implementation. Simulation studies and a real application in financial forecasting are presented. In effect, this article covers methodology, theory, computation, and application for individualized inference by iFusion.},

Drawing on a multi-hospital electronic health records network, we develop an eﬃcient and interpretable tree-based ensemble of personalized treatment eﬀect estimators to join results across hospital sites, while actively modeling for the heterogeneity in data sources through site partitioning. The eﬃciency of this approach is demonstrated by a study of causal eﬀects of oxygen saturation on hospital mortality and backed up by comprehensive numerical results.},

	abstract = {Background: Network meta-analysis (NMA) is a methodology for indirectly comparing, and strengthening direct comparisons of two or more treatments for the management of disease by combining evidence from multiple studies. It is sometimes not possible to perform treatment comparisons as evidence networks restricted to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) may be disconnected. We propose a Bayesian NMA model that allows to include single-arm, before-and-after, observational studies to complete these disconnected networks. We illustrate the method with an indirect comparison of treatments for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).
Methods: Our method uses a random effects model for placebo improvements to include single-arm observational studies into a general NMA. Building on recent research for binary outcomes, we develop a covariate-adjusted continuous-outcome NMA model that combines individual patient data (IPD) and aggregate data from two-arm RCTs with the single-arm observational studies. We apply this model to a complex comparison of therapies for PAH combining IPD from a phase-III RCT of imatinib as add-on therapy for PAH and aggregate data from RCTs and single-arm observational studies, both identified by a systematic review.
Results: Through the inclusion of observational studies, our method allowed the comparison of imatinib as add-on therapy for PAH with other treatments. This comparison had not been previously possible due to the limited RCT evidence available. However, the credible intervals of our posterior estimates were wide so the overall results were inconclusive. The comparison should be treated as exploratory and should not be used to guide clinical practice.
Conclusions: Our method for the inclusion of single-arm observational studies allows the performance of indirect comparisons that had previously not been possible due to incomplete networks composed solely of available RCTs. We also built on many recent innovations to enable researchers to use both aggregate data and IPD. This method could be used in similar situations where treatment comparisons have not been possible due to restrictions to RCT evidence and where a mixture of aggregate data and IPD are available.},

	abstract = {Background: Meta-analyses (MA) based on individual patient data (IPD) are regarded as the gold standard for meta-analyses and are becoming increasingly common, having several advantages over meta-analyses of summary statistics. These analyses are being undertaken in an increasing diversity of settings, often having a binary outcome. In a previous systematic review of articles published between 1999–2001, the statistical approach was seldom reported in sufficient detail, and the outcome was binary in 32\% of the studies considered. Here, we explore statistical methods used for IPD-MA of binary outcomes only, a decade later.
Methods: We selected 56 articles, published in 2011 that presented results from an individual patient data meta-analysis. Of these, 26 considered a binary outcome. Here, we review 26 IPD-MA published during 2011 to consider: the goal of the study and reason for conducting an IPD-MA, whether they obtained all the data they sought, the approach used in their analysis, for instance, a two-stage or a one stage model, and the assumption of fixed or random effects. We also investigated how heterogeneity across studies was described and how studies investigated the effects of covariates.
Results: 19 of the 26 IPD-MA used a one-stage approach. 9 IPD-MA used a one-stage random treatment-effect logistic regression model, allowing the treatment effect to vary across studies. Twelve IPD-MA presented some form of statistic to measure heterogeneity across studies, though these were usually calculated using two-stage approach. Subgroup analyses were undertaken in all IPD-MA that aimed to estimate a treatment effect or safety of a treatment,. Sixteen meta-analyses obtained 90\% or more of the patients sought.
Conclusion: Evidence from this systematic review shows that the use of binary outcomes in assessing the effects of health care problems has increased, with random effects logistic regression the most common method of analysis. Methods are still often not reported in enough detail. Results also show that heterogeneity of treatment effects is discussed in most applications.},

	url = {https://osf.io/myg6s},
	abstract = {Meta-analyses in psychology often lack the power to adequately account for between-studies heterogeneity. The number of studies on any topic is typically low, because research is cost- and time-intensive. At the same time, a host of potential moderators are introduced when similar research questions are examined in different labs, sampling from different populations, using idiosyncratic methods and instrumentation. Such between-studies heterogeneity presents a substantial challenge to data aggregation in classic meta-analysis. When the causes for heterogeneity are known a-priori, they can be accounted for using meta-regression. What is currently lacking, however, is an exploratory approach, to be used when heterogeneity is suspected, but it is not known which moderators most strongly influence the observed effect size. Recently, weighted regression trees have been used to explore heterogeneity in meta-analysis. Although this provides a promising first step, single trees have many limitations, which can be overcome by using random forests: A powerful learning algorithm, which is flexible, yet relatively robust to overfitting. The present paper introduces MetaForest: An adaptation of random forests for meta-analysis. We present two simulation studies, which illustrate that, in datasets as small as 20 cases, MetaForest outperforms single trees, in terms of three metrics: 1) Predictive performance; 2) power, as evidenced by the proportion of datasets in which the algorithm achieved a positive R2cv; and 3) the ability to distinguish relevant moderators from irrelevant moderators, using variable importance measures. We discuss how MetaForest can enhance the exploration of between-studies heterogeneity when conducting meta-analyses in diverse bodies of literature.},

	abstract = {Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) provide reliable evidence for approval of new treatments, informing clinical practice , and coverage decisions. The participants in RCTs are often not a representative sample of the larger at-risk population. Hence, it is argued that the average treatment effect from the trial is not generalizable to the larger at-risk population. An essential premise of this argument is that there is significant heterogeneity in the treatment effect (HTE). We present a new method to extrapolate the treatment effect from a trial to a target group that is inadequately represented in the trial, when HTE is present. Our method integrates trial and observational data (cross-design synthesis). The target group is assumed to be well-represented in the observational database such that the observational study essentially acts as an “evidentiary bridge”that allows evidence to be transported from the trial sample to the target population. An essential component of the methodology is the estimation of calibration adjustments for unmeasured confounding in the observational sample. The estimate of treatment effect, adjusted for unmeasured confounding, is projected onto the target sample using a weighted G-computation approach. We present simulation studies to demonstrate the methodology for estimating the marginal treatment effect in a target sample that differs from the trial sample to varying degrees. In a companion article, we demonstrate and validate the methodology in a clinical application.},

	abstract = {Background: Several indirect comparison methods, including network meta-analyses (NMAs), using individual patient data (IPD) have been developed to synthesize evidence from a network of trials. Although IPD indirect comparisons are published with increasing frequency in health care literature, there is no guidance on selecting the appropriate methodology and on reporting the methods and results.
Methods: In this paper we examine the methods and reporting of indirect comparison methods using IPD. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and CINAHL from inception until October 2014. We included published and unpublished studies reporting a method, application, or review of indirect comparisons using IPD and at least three interventions.
Results: We identified 37 papers, including a total of 33 empirical networks. Of these, only 9 (27 \%) IPD-NMAs reported the existence of a study protocol, whereas 3 (9 \%) studies mentioned that protocols existed without providing a reference. The 33 empirical networks included 24 (73 \%) IPD-NMAs and 9 (27 \%) matching adjusted indirect comparisons (MAICs). Of the 21 (64 \%) networks with at least one closed loop, 19 (90 \%) were IPD-NMAs, 13 (68 \%) of which evaluated the prerequisite consistency assumption, and only 5 (38 \%) of the 13 IPD-NMAs used statistical approaches. The median number of trials included per network was 10 (IQR 4–19) (IPD-NMA: 15 [IQR 8–20]; MAIC: 2 [IQR 3–5]), and the median number of IPD trials included in a network was 3 (IQR 1–9) (IPD-NMA: 6 [IQR 2–11]; MAIC: 2 [IQR 1–2]). Half of the networks (17; 52 \%) applied Bayesian hierarchical models (14 one-stage, 1 two-stage, 1 used IPD as an informative prior, 1 unclear-stage), including either IPD alone or with aggregated data (AD). Models for dichotomous and continuous outcomes were available (IPD alone or combined with AD), as were models for time-to-event data (IPD combined with AD).
Conclusions: One in three indirect comparison methods modeling IPD adjusted results from different trials to estimate effects as if they had come from the same, randomized, population. Key methodological and reporting elements (e.g., evaluation of consistency, existence of study protocol) were often missing from an indirect comparison paper.},

Till date, most insight into the causal inference requires data to be stored in a central repository. We present a novel framework for causal inference with federated data sources. We assess and integrate local causal eﬀects from diﬀerent private data sources without centralizing them. Then, the treatment eﬀects on subjects from observational data using a non-parametric reformulation of the classical potential outcomes framework is estimated. We model the potential outcomes as a random function distributed by Gaussian processes, whose deﬁning parameters can be eﬃciently learned from multiple data sources, respecting privacy constraints.

This access provides an unprecedented opportunity for data science technologies to derive data-driven insights and improve the quality of care delivery. Healthcare data, however, are usually fragmented and private making it difficult to generate robust results across populations. For example, different hospitals own the electronic health records (EHR) of different patient populations and these records are difficult to share across hospitals because of their sensitive nature. This creates a big barrier for developing effective analytical approaches that are generalizable, which need diverse, “big data.” Federated learning, a mechanism of training a shared global model with a central server while keeping all the sensitive data in local institutions where the data belong, provides great promise to connect the fragmented healthcare data sources with privacy-preservation. The goal of this survey is to provide a review for federated learning technologies, particularly within the biomedical space. In particular, we summarize the general solutions to the statistical challenges, system challenges, and privacy issues in federated learning, and point out the implications and potentials in healthcare.},

	abstract = {The heterogeneity of treatment eﬀect (HTE) lies at the heart of precision medicine. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are gold-standard to estimate the HTE but are typically underpowered. While real-world data (RWD) have large predictive power but are often confounded due to lack of randomization of treatment. In this article, we show that the RWD, even subject to hidden confounding, may be used to empower RCTs in estimating the HTE using the confounding function. The confounding function summarizes the impact of unmeasured confounders on the diﬀerence in the potential outcome between the treated and untreated groups, accounting for the observed covariates, which is unidentiﬁable based only on the RWD. Coupling the RCT and RWD, we show that the HTE and confounding function are identiﬁable. We then derive the semiparametric eﬃcient scores and integrative estimators of the HTE and confounding function. We clarify the conditions under which the integrative estimator of the HTE is strictly more eﬃcient than the RCT estimator. As a by-product, our framework can be used to generalize the average treatment eﬀects from the RCT to a target population without requiring an overlap covariate distribution assumption between the RCT and RWD. We illustrate the integrative estimators with a simulation study and an application.},

	abstract = {Network meta-analysis expands the scope of a conventional pairwise meta-analysis to simultaneously compare multiple treatments, synthesizing both direct and indirect information and thus strengthening inference. Since most of trials only compare two treatments, a typical data set in a network meta-analysis managed as a trial-by-treatment matrix is extremely sparse, like an incomplete block structure with significant missing data. Zhang et al. proposed an arm-based method accounting for correlations among different treatments within the same trial and assuming that absent arms are missing at random. However, in randomized controlled trials, nonignorable missingness or missingness not at random may occur due to deliberate choices of treatments at the design stage. In addition, those undertaking a network metaanalysis may selectively choose treatments to include in the analysis, which may also lead to missingness not at random. In this paper, we extend our previous work to incorporate missingness not at random using selection models. The proposed method is then applied to two network meta-analyses and evaluated through extensive simulation studies. We also provide comprehensive comparisons of a commonly used contrast-based method and the arm-based method via simulations in a technical appendix under missing completely at random and missing at random.},

	abstract = {Network meta-analysis (NMA) is a common approach to summarizing relative treatment effects from randomized trials with different treatment comparisons. Most NMAs are based on published aggregate data (AD) and have limited possibilities for investigating the extent of network consistency and between-study heterogeneity. Given that individual participant data (IPD) are considered the gold standard in evidence synthesis, we explored statistical methods for IPD-NMA and investigated their potential advantages and limitations, compared with AD-NMA. We discuss several one-stage random-effects NMA models that account for within-trial imbalances, treatment effect modifiers, missing response data and longitudinal responses. We illustrate all models in a case study of 18 antidepressant trials with a continuous endpoint (the Hamilton Depression Score). All trials suffered from drop-out; missingness of longitudinal responses ranged from 21 to 41\% after 6 weeks follow-up. Our results indicate that NMA based on IPD may lead to increased precision of estimated treatment effects. Furthermore, it can help to improve network consistency and explain between-study heterogeneity by adjusting for participant-level effect modifiers and adopting more advanced models for dealing with missing response data. We conclude that implementation of IPD-NMA should be considered when trials are affected by substantial drop-out rate, and when treatment effects are potentially influenced by participant-level covariates.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03529},
	abstract = {Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are increasingly prevalent in education research, and are often regarded as a gold standard of causal inference. Two main virtues of randomized experiments are that they (1) do not suffer from confounding, thereby allowing for an unbiased estimate of an intervention's causal impact, and (2) allow for design-based inference, meaning that the physical act of randomization largely justifies the statistical assumptions made. However, RCT sample sizes are often small, leading to low precision; in many cases RCT estimates may be too imprecise to guide policy or inform science. Observational studies, by contrast, have strengths and weaknesses complementary to those of RCTs. Observational studies typically offer much larger sample sizes, but may suffer confounding. In many contexts, experimental and observational data exist side by side, allowing the possibility of integrating "big observational data" with "small but high-quality experimental data" to get the best of both. Such approaches hold particular promise in the field of education, where RCT sample sizes are often small due to cost constraints, but automatic collection of observational data, such as in computerized educational technology applications, or in state longitudinal data systems (SLDS) with administrative data on hundreds of thousand of students, has made rich, high-dimensional observational data widely available. We outline an approach that allows one to employ machine learning algorithms to learn from the observational data, and use the resulting models to improve precision in randomized experiments. Importantly, there is no requirement that the machine learning models are "correct" in any sense, and the final experimental results are guaranteed to be exactly unbiased. Thus, there is no danger of confounding biases in the observational data leaking into the experiment.},

We show that it is possible to nonparametrically debias both types of studies using an Instrumental Variables (IV) strategy, and thus uncover the true population distribution of treatment effects for complier studies. As we often have a small number of studies, imperfect instruments, and only observe study results with error, parametric hierarchical Bayesian models work well in practice. Our specific implementation uses the establishment of a facilitating organisation such as the Jameel Poverty Action Lab or Innovations for Poverty Action in a location using a novel Differences in Differences “Plausibly Exogenous” IV model. Unlike alternative approaches, our model is point-identifying and yields a Wald Estimator representation of the local average treatment effect (LATE) for compliers. Applying this strategy to applications in Conditional Cash Transfers (CCTs) and Microcredit shows substantial internal selection bias in observational studies of CCTs and much less bias for Microcredit; neither application shows evidence of RCT site selection bias, though credible intervals are wide.},

I show that if these characteristics can partially explain treatment assignment in the observational data, they can be used to derive moment restrictions that, in combination with the experimental data, improve estimation eﬃciency. I outline three estimators (weighting, shrinkage, or GMM) for implementing this strategy, and show that my methods can reduce variance by up to 50\% in typical experimental designs; therefore, only half of the experimental sample is required to attain the same statistical precision. If researchers are allowed to design experiments diﬀerently, I show that they can further improve the precision by directly leveraging this correlation between characteristics and assignment. I apply my method to a search listing dataset from Expedia that studies the causal eﬀect of search rankings, and show that the method can substantially improve the precision.},

We develop a federated adaptive causal estimation (FACE) framework to incorporate heterogeneous data from multiple sites to provide treatment eﬀect estimation and inference for a target population of interest. Our strategy is communication-eﬃcient and privacy-preserving and allows for ﬂexibility in the speciﬁcation of the target population. Our method accounts for site-level heterogeneity in the distribution of covariates through density ratio weighting. To safely aggregate estimates from all sites and avoid negative transfer, we introduce an adaptive procedure of weighing the estimators constructed using data from the target and source populations through a penalized regression on the inﬂuence functions, which achieves 1) consistency and 2) optimal eﬃciency. We illustrate FACE by conducting a comparative eﬀectiveness study of BNT162b2 (Pﬁzer) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccines on COVID-19 outcomes in U.S. veterans using electronic health records from ﬁve VA sites.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03529},
	abstract = {Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are increasingly prevalent in education research, and are often regarded as a gold standard of causal inference. Two main virtues of randomized experiments are that they (1) do not suffer from confounding, thereby allowing for an unbiased estimate of an intervention's causal impact, and (2) allow for design-based inference, meaning that the physical act of randomization largely justifies the statistical assumptions made. However, RCT sample sizes are often small, leading to low precision; in many cases RCT estimates may be too imprecise to guide policy or inform science. Observational studies, by contrast, have strengths and weaknesses complementary to those of RCTs. Observational studies typically offer much larger sample sizes, but may suffer confounding. In many contexts, experimental and observational data exist side by side, allowing the possibility of integrating "big observational data" with "small but high-quality experimental data" to get the best of both. Such approaches hold particular promise in the field of education, where RCT sample sizes are often small due to cost constraints, but automatic collection of observational data, such as in computerized educational technology applications, or in state longitudinal data systems (SLDS) with administrative data on hundreds of thousand of students, has made rich, high-dimensional observational data widely available. We outline an approach that allows one to employ machine learning algorithms to learn from the observational data, and use the resulting models to improve precision in randomized experiments. Importantly, there is no requirement that the machine learning models are "correct" in any sense, and the final experimental results are guaranteed to be exactly unbiased. Thus, there is no danger of confounding biases in the observational data leaking into the experiment.},

We show that it is possible to nonparametrically debias both types of studies using an Instrumental Variables (IV) strategy, and thus uncover the true population distribution of treatment effects for complier studies. As we often have a small number of studies, imperfect instruments, and only observe study results with error, parametric hierarchical Bayesian models work well in practice. Our specific implementation uses the establishment of a facilitating organisation such as the Jameel Poverty Action Lab or Innovations for Poverty Action in a location using a novel Differences in Differences “Plausibly Exogenous” IV model. Unlike alternative approaches, our model is point-identifying and yields a Wald Estimator representation of the local average treatment effect (LATE) for compliers. Applying this strategy to applications in Conditional Cash Transfers (CCTs) and Microcredit shows substantial internal selection bias in observational studies of CCTs and much less bias for Microcredit; neither application shows evidence of RCT site selection bias, though credible intervals are wide.},

I outline three estimators (weighting, shrinkage, or GMM) for implementing this strategy, and show that my methods can reduce variance by up to 50\% in typical experimental designs; therefore, only half of the experimental sample is required to attain the same statistical precision. If researchers are allowed to design experiments diﬀerently, I show that they can further improve the precision by directly leveraging this correlation between characteristics and assignment. I apply my method to a search listing dataset from Expedia that studies the causal eﬀect of search rankings, and show that the method can substantially improve the precision.},

We develop a federated adaptive causal estimation (FACE) framework to incorporate heterogeneous data from multiple sites to provide treatment eﬀect estimation and inference for a target population of interest. Our strategy is communication-eﬃcient and privacy-preserving and allows for ﬂexibility in the speciﬁcation of the target population. Our method accounts for site-level heterogeneity in the distribution of covariates through density ratio weighting. To safely aggregate estimates from all sites and avoid negative transfer, we introduce an adaptive procedure of weighing the estimators constructed using data from the target and source populations through a penalized regression on the inﬂuence functions, which achieves 1) consistency and 2) optimal eﬃciency. We illustrate FACE by conducting a comparative eﬀectiveness study of BNT162b2 (Pﬁzer) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccines on COVID-19 outcomes in U.S. veterans using electronic health records from ﬁve VA sites.},

	abstract = {Objectives. Bayesian statistical methods are increasingly popular as a tool for meta-analysis of clinical trial data involving both direct and indirect treatment comparisons. However, appropriate selection of prior distributions for unknown model parameters and checking of consistency assumptions required for modeling remain particularly challenging. We compared Bayesian and traditional frequentist statistical methods for mixed treatment comparisons with multiple binary outcomes. Data. We searched major electronic bibliographic databases, Food and Drug Administration reviews, trial registries, and research grant databases up to December 2011 to find randomized studies published in English that examined drugs for female urgency urinary incontinence (UI) on continence, improvement in UI, and treatment discontinuation due to harm. Methods. We describe and fit fixed and random effects models in both Bayesian and frequentist statistical frameworks. In a hierarchical model of 8 treatments, we separately analyze 1 safety and 2 efficacy outcomes. We produce Bayesian and frequentist treatment ranks and odds ratios across all drug v placebo comparisons, as well as Bayesian probabilities that each drug is best overall through a weighted scoring rule that trades off efficacy and safety. Results. In our study, Bayesian and frequentist random effects models generally suggest the same drugs as most attractive, although neither suggests any significant differences between drugs. However, the Bayesian methods more consistently identify one drug (propiverine) as best overall, produce interval estimates that are generally better at capturing all sources of uncertainty in the data, and also permit attractive “rankograms” that visually capture the probability that each drug assumes each possible rank. Conclusions. Bayesian methods are more flexible and their results more clinically interpretable, but they require more careful development and specialized software.},

In this framework, the optimal weights, minimizing the quadratic loss, are entirely determined by the mean squared error matrix of the vector of initial estimators. The averaging estimator is built using an estimation of this matrix, which can be computed from the same dataset. A non-asymptotic error bound on the averaging estimator is derived, leading to asymptotic optimality under mild conditions on the estimated mean squared error matrix.

Unfortunately, evidence of real world effectiveness for new interventions is not available at the time of initial approval. To bridge this gap, statistical methods are available to extend the estimated treatment effect observed in a RCT to a target population. The generalization is done by weighting the subjects who participated in a RCT so that the weighted trial population resembles a target population. We evaluate a variety of alternative estimation and weight construction procedures using both simulations and a real world data example using two clinical trials of an investigational intervention for Alzheimer's disease. Our results suggest an optimal approach to estimation depends on the characteristics of source and target populations, including degree of selection bias and treatment effect heterogeneity.},

Investigators may be interested in using the individual patient data from multiple studies to estimate these treatment effect models. Our data arise from a systematic review of observational studies contrasting different treatments for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, where multiple antimicrobial agents are taken concurrently to cure the infection. We propose a marginal structural model for effect modiﬁcation by different patient characteristics and co-medications in a meta-analysis of observational individual patient data. We develop, evaluate, and apply a targeted maximum likelihood estimator for the doubly robust estimation of the parameters of the proposed marginal structural model in this context.

However, there are often observational data sets available that are orders of magnitude larger. We propose a method to combine these two data sources to estimate heterogeneous treatment eﬀects. First, we use observational time series data to estimate a mapping from covariates to unit-level eﬀects. These estimates are likely biased but under some conditions the bias preserves unit-level relative rank orderings. If these conditions hold, we only need suﬃcient experimental data to identify a monotonic, one-dimensional transformation from observationally predicted treatment eﬀects to real treatment eﬀects.

These data may be used to supplement experimental data, which is frequently expensive to obtain. In Rosenman et al. (2018), we considered this problem under the assumption that all confounders were measured. Here, we relax the assumption of unconfoundedness. To derive combined estimators with desirable properties, we make use of results from the Stein Shrinkage literature. Our contributions are threefold. First, we propose a generic procedure for deriving shrinkage estimators in this setting, making use of a generalized unbiased risk estimate. Second, we develop two new estimators, prove finite sample conditions under which they have lower risk than an estimator using only experimental data, and show that each achieves a notion of asymptotic optimality. Third, we draw connections between our approach and results in sensitivity analysis, including proposing a method for evaluating the feasibility of our estimators.},

	abstract = {While standard meta-analysis pools the results from randomized trials that compare two treatments, network meta-analysis aggregates the results of randomized trials comparing a wider variety of treatment options. However, it is unclear whether the aggregation of eﬀect estimates across heterogeneous populations will be consistent for a meaningful parameter when not all treatments are evaluated on each population. Drawing from counterfactual theory and the causal inference framework, we deﬁne the population of interest in a network meta-analysis and deﬁne the target parameter under a series of nonparametric structural assumptions. This allows us to determine the requirements for identiﬁability of this parameter, enabling a description of the conditions under which network meta-analysis is appropriate and when it might mislead decision making. We then adapt several modeling strategies from the causal inference literature to obtain consistent estimation of the intervention-speciﬁc mean outcome and model-independent contrasts between treatments. Finally, we perform a reanalysis of a systematic review to compare the eﬀicacy of antibiotics on suspected or conﬁrmed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in hospitalized patients.},

	abstract = {Meta-analysis of individual patient data (IPD) is increasingly used to synthesize data from multiple trials. IPD meta-analysis offers several advantages over meta-analyzing aggregate data, including the capacity to individualize treatment recommendations. Trials usually collect information on many patient characteristics. Some of these covariates may strongly interact with treatment (and thus be associated with treatment effect modification) while others may have little effect. It is currently unclear whether a systematic approach to the selection of treatment-covariate interactions in an IPD meta-analysis can lead to better estimates of patient-specific treatment effects. We aimed to answer this question by comparing in simulations the standard approach to IPD meta-analysis (no variable selection, all treatment-covariate interactions included in the model) with six alternative methods: stepwise regression, and five regression methods that perform shrinkage on treatment-covariate interactions, that is, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), ridge, adaptive LASSO, Bayesian LASSO, and stochastic search variable selection. Exploring a range of scenarios, we found that shrinkage methods performed well for both continuous and dichotomous outcomes, for a variety of settings. In most scenarios, these methods gave lower mean squared error of the patient-specific treatment effect as compared with the standard approach and stepwise regression. We illustrate the application of these methods in two datasets from cardiology and psychiatry. We recommend that future IPD meta-analysis that aim to estimate patient-specific treatment effects using multiple effect modifiers should use shrinkage methods, whereas stepwise regression should be avoided.},

	abstract = {Inferences from different data sources can often be fused together, a process referred to as “fusion learning,” to yield more powerful findings than those from individual data sources alone. Effective fusion learning approaches are in growing demand as increasing number of data sources have become easily available in this big data era. This article proposes a new fusion learning approach, called “iFusion,” for drawing efficient individualized inference by fusing learnings from relevant data sources. Specifically, iFusion (i) summarizes inferences from individual data sources as individual confidence distributions (CDs); (ii) forms a clique of individuals that bear relevance to the target individual and then combines the CDs from those relevant individuals; and, finally, (iii) draws inference for the target individual from the combined CD. In essence, iFusion strategically “borrows strength” from relevant individuals to enhance the efficiency of the target individual inference while preserving its validity. This article focuses on the setting where each individual study has a number of observations but its inference can be further improved by incorporating additional information from similar studies that is referred to as its clique. Under the setting, iFusion is shown to achieve oracle property under suitable conditions. It is also shown to be flexible and robust in handling heterogeneity arising from diverse data sources. The development is ideally suited for goaldirected applications. Computationally, iFusion is parallel in nature and scales up easily for big data. An efficient scalable algorithm is provided for implementation. Simulation studies and a real application in financial forecasting are presented. In effect, this article covers methodology, theory, computation, and application for individualized inference by iFusion.},

Drawing on a multi-hospital electronic health records network, we develop an eﬃcient and interpretable tree-based ensemble of personalized treatment eﬀect estimators to join results across hospital sites, while actively modeling for the heterogeneity in data sources through site partitioning.

	abstract = {Background: Network meta-analysis (NMA) is a methodology for indirectly comparing, and strengthening direct comparisons of two or more treatments for the management of disease by combining evidence from multiple studies. It is sometimes not possible to perform treatment comparisons as evidence networks restricted to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) may be disconnected. We propose a Bayesian NMA model that allows to include single-arm, before-and-after, observational studies to complete these disconnected networks. We illustrate the method with an indirect comparison of treatments for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).
Methods: Our method uses a random effects model for placebo improvements to include single-arm observational studies into a general NMA. Building on recent research for binary outcomes, we develop a covariate-adjusted continuous-outcome NMA model that combines individual patient data (IPD) and aggregate data from two-arm RCTs with the single-arm observational studies. We apply this model to a complex comparison of therapies for PAH combining IPD from a phase-III RCT of imatinib as add-on therapy for PAH and aggregate data from RCTs and single-arm observational studies, both identified by a systematic review.
Results: Through the inclusion of observational studies, our method allowed the comparison of imatinib as add-on therapy for PAH with other treatments. This comparison had not been previously possible due to the limited RCT evidence available. However, the credible intervals of our posterior estimates were wide so the overall results were inconclusive. The comparison should be treated as exploratory and should not be used to guide clinical practice.
Conclusions: Our method for the inclusion of single-arm observational studies allows the performance of indirect comparisons that had previously not been possible due to incomplete networks composed solely of available RCTs. We also built on many recent innovations to enable researchers to use both aggregate data and IPD. This method could be used in similar situations where treatment comparisons have not been possible due to restrictions to RCT evidence and where a mixture of aggregate data and IPD are available.},

	abstract = {Background: Meta-analyses (MA) based on individual patient data (IPD) are regarded as the gold standard for meta-analyses and are becoming increasingly common, having several advantages over meta-analyses of summary statistics. These analyses are being undertaken in an increasing diversity of settings, often having a binary outcome. In a previous systematic review of articles published between 1999–2001, the statistical approach was seldom reported in sufficient detail, and the outcome was binary in 32\% of the studies considered. Here, we explore statistical methods used for IPD-MA of binary outcomes only, a decade later.
Methods: We selected 56 articles, published in 2011 that presented results from an individual patient data meta-analysis. Of these, 26 considered a binary outcome. Here, we review 26 IPD-MA published during 2011 to consider: the goal of the study and reason for conducting an IPD-MA, whether they obtained all the data they sought, the approach used in their analysis, for instance, a two-stage or a one stage model, and the assumption of fixed or random effects. We also investigated how heterogeneity across studies was described and how studies investigated the effects of covariates.
Results: 19 of the 26 IPD-MA used a one-stage approach. 9 IPD-MA used a one-stage random treatment-effect logistic regression model, allowing the treatment effect to vary across studies. Twelve IPD-MA presented some form of statistic to measure heterogeneity across studies, though these were usually calculated using two-stage approach. Subgroup analyses were undertaken in all IPD-MA that aimed to estimate a treatment effect or safety of a treatment,. Sixteen meta-analyses obtained 90\% or more of the patients sought.
Conclusion: Evidence from this systematic review shows that the use of binary outcomes in assessing the effects of health care problems has increased, with random effects logistic regression the most common method of analysis. Methods are still often not reported in enough detail. Results also show that heterogeneity of treatment effects is discussed in most applications.},

	url = {https://osf.io/myg6s},
	abstract = {Meta-analyses in psychology often lack the power to adequately account for between-studies heterogeneity. The number of studies on any topic is typically low, because research is cost- and time-intensive. At the same time, a host of potential moderators are introduced when similar research questions are examined in different labs, sampling from different populations, using idiosyncratic methods and instrumentation. Such between-studies heterogeneity presents a substantial challenge to data aggregation in classic meta-analysis. When the causes for heterogeneity are known a-priori, they can be accounted for using meta-regression. What is currently lacking, however, is an exploratory approach, to be used when heterogeneity is suspected, but it is not known which moderators most strongly influence the observed effect size. Recently, weighted regression trees have been used to explore heterogeneity in meta-analysis. Although this provides a promising first step, single trees have many limitations, which can be overcome by using random forests: A powerful learning algorithm, which is flexible, yet relatively robust to overfitting. The present paper introduces MetaForest: An adaptation of random forests for meta-analysis. We present two simulation studies, which illustrate that, in datasets as small as 20 cases, MetaForest outperforms single trees, in terms of three metrics: 1) Predictive performance; 2) power, as evidenced by the proportion of datasets in which the algorithm achieved a positive R2cv; and 3) the ability to distinguish relevant moderators from irrelevant moderators, using variable importance measures. We discuss how MetaForest can enhance the exploration of between-studies heterogeneity when conducting meta-analyses in diverse bodies of literature.},

	abstract = {Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) provide reliable evidence for approval of new treatments, informing clinical practice , and coverage decisions. The participants in RCTs are often not a representative sample of the larger at-risk population. Hence, it is argued that the average treatment effect from the trial is not generalizable to the larger at-risk population. An essential premise of this argument is that there is significant heterogeneity in the treatment effect (HTE). We present a new method to extrapolate the treatment effect from a trial to a target group that is inadequately represented in the trial, when HTE is present. Our method integrates trial and observational data (cross-design synthesis). The target group is assumed to be well-represented in the observational database such that the observational study essentially acts as an “evidentiary bridge”that allows evidence to be transported from the trial sample to the target population. An essential component of the methodology is the estimation of calibration adjustments for unmeasured confounding in the observational sample. The estimate of treatment effect, adjusted for unmeasured confounding, is projected onto the target sample using a weighted G-computation approach. We present simulation studies to demonstrate the methodology for estimating the marginal treatment effect in a target sample that differs from the trial sample to varying degrees. In a companion article, we demonstrate and validate the methodology in a clinical application.},

Although IPD indirect comparisons are published with increasing frequency in health care literature, there is no guidance on selecting the appropriate methodology and on reporting the methods and results.
Methods: In this paper we examine the methods and reporting of indirect comparison methods using IPD. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and CINAHL from inception until October 2014. We included published and unpublished studies reporting a method, application, or review of indirect comparisons using IPD and at least three interventions.
Results: We identified 37 papers, including a total of 33 empirical networks. Of these, only 9 (27 \%) IPD-NMAs reported the existence of a study protocol, whereas 3 (9 \%) studies mentioned that protocols existed without providing a reference. The 33 empirical networks included 24 (73 \%) IPD-NMAs and 9 (27 \%) matching adjusted indirect comparisons (MAICs). Of the 21 (64 \%) networks with at least one closed loop, 19 (90 \%) were IPD-NMAs, 13 (68 \%) of which evaluated the prerequisite consistency assumption, and only 5 (38 \%) of the 13 IPD-NMAs used statistical approaches. The median number of trials included per network was 10 (IQR 4–19) (IPD-NMA: 15 [IQR 8–20]; MAIC: 2 [IQR 3–5]), and the median number of IPD trials included in a network was 3 (IQR 1–9) (IPD-NMA: 6 [IQR 2–11]; MAIC: 2 [IQR 1–2]). Half of the networks (17; 52 \%) applied Bayesian hierarchical models (14 one-stage, 1 two-stage, 1 used IPD as an informative prior, 1 unclear-stage), including either IPD alone or with aggregated data (AD). Models for dichotomous and continuous outcomes were available (IPD alone or combined with AD), as were models for time-to-event data (IPD combined with AD).
Conclusions: One in three indirect comparison methods modeling IPD adjusted results from different trials to estimate effects as if they had come from the same, randomized, population. Key methodological and reporting elements (e.g., evaluation of consistency, existence of study protocol) were often missing from an indirect comparison paper.},

Till date, most insight into the causal inference requires data to be stored in a central repository. We present a novel framework for causal inference with federated data sources. We assess and integrate local causal eﬀects from diﬀerent private data sources without centralizing them. Then, the treatment eﬀects on subjects from observational data using a non-parametric reformulation of the classical potential outcomes framework is estimated. We model the potential outcomes as a random function distributed by Gaussian processes, whose deﬁning parameters can be eﬃciently learned from multiple data sources, respecting privacy constraints. We demonstrate the promise and eﬃciency of the proposed approach through a set of simulated and real-world benchmark examples.},

This paper develops federated methods that only utilize summary-level information from heterogeneous data sets. Our federated methods provide doubly-robust point estimates of treatment eﬀects as well as variance estimates. We derive the asymptotic distributions of our federated estimators, which are shown to be asymptotically equivalent to the corresponding estimators from the combined, individual-level data. We show that to achieve these properties, federated methods should be adjusted based on conditions such as whether models are correctly speciﬁed and stable across heterogeneous data sets.},

This access provides an unprecedented opportunity for data science technologies to derive data-driven insights and improve the quality of care delivery. Healthcare data, however, are usually fragmented and private making it difficult to generate robust results across populations. For example, different hospitals own the electronic health records (EHR) of different patient populations and these records are difficult to share across hospitals because of their sensitive nature. This creates a big barrier for developing effective analytical approaches that are generalizable, which need diverse, “big data.” Federated learning, a mechanism of training a shared global model with a central server while keeping all the sensitive data in local institutions where the data belong, provides great promise to connect the fragmented healthcare data sources with privacy-preservation. The goal of this survey is to provide a review for federated learning technologies, particularly within the biomedical space. In particular, we summarize the general solutions to the statistical challenges, system challenges, and privacy issues in federated learning, and point out the implications and potentials in healthcare.},

	abstract = {The heterogeneity of treatment eﬀect (HTE) lies at the heart of precision medicine. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are gold-standard to estimate the HTE but are typically underpowered. While real-world data (RWD) have large predictive power but are often confounded due to lack of randomization of treatment. In this article, we show that the RWD, even subject to hidden confounding, may be used to empower RCTs in estimating the HTE using the confounding function. The confounding function summarizes the impact of unmeasured confounders on the diﬀerence in the potential outcome between the treated and untreated groups, accounting for the observed covariates, which is unidentiﬁable based only on the RWD. Coupling the RCT and RWD, we show that the HTE and confounding function are identiﬁable. We then derive the semiparametric eﬃcient scores and integrative estimators of the HTE and confounding function. We clarify the conditions under which the integrative estimator of the HTE is strictly more eﬃcient than the RCT estimator. As a by-product, our framework can be used to generalize the average treatment eﬀects from the RCT to a target population without requiring an overlap covariate distribution assumption between the RCT and RWD. We illustrate the integrative estimators with a simulation study and an application.},

	abstract = {Network meta-analysis expands the scope of a conventional pairwise meta-analysis to simultaneously compare multiple treatments, synthesizing both direct and indirect information and thus strengthening inference. Since most of trials only compare two treatments, a typical data set in a network meta-analysis managed as a trial-by-treatment matrix is extremely sparse, like an incomplete block structure with significant missing data. Zhang et al. proposed an arm-based method accounting for correlations among different treatments within the same trial and assuming that absent arms are missing at random. However, in randomized controlled trials, nonignorable missingness or missingness not at random may occur due to deliberate choices of treatments at the design stage. In addition, those undertaking a network metaanalysis may selectively choose treatments to include in the analysis, which may also lead to missingness not at random. In this paper, we extend our previous work to incorporate missingness not at random using selection models. The proposed method is then applied to two network meta-analyses and evaluated through extensive simulation studies. We also provide comprehensive comparisons of a commonly used contrast-based method and the arm-based method via simulations in a technical appendix under missing completely at random and missing at random.},

Methods. First-year students completed a ﬁve-minute SJT in lieu of a multiple mini interview (MMI) during the end-of-year capstone. For each SJT item, students selected the two most appropriate response options from a list of ﬁve. Various strategies to score the SJT were compared to evaluate the psychometric properties of the test. Student performance on the SJT was examined in relationship to performance on other measures, (eg, MMI stations, personality assessments, and admissions data).
Results. A total of 135 ﬁrst-year pharmacy students completed an average of 9.5 items. Scoring keys based on subject matter experts’ and student responses demonstrated high reliability. There was a positive, weak relationship between student performance on the SJT and performance on the adaptability station used in the capstone, and an inverse, weak relationship with students’ agreeableness scores.
Conclusion. This study suggests that the SJT may be a feasible and efﬁcient assessment strategy in pharmacy education. Additional research is needed to inform SJT design, implementation, and interpretation.},

These models revealed that weekly percentages of mental distress were higher in counties with higher unemployment rates, populations, and education levels; higher percentages of females, young adults, individuals with a medical condition, and individuals very worried about their finances and COVID-19; and lower percentages of individuals who were working outside the home, living with children, without health insurance, and Black. Anxiety peaked in April 2020, depression in October 2020, and isolation in December 2020.

Findings. In the 145 IPE studies included in the review, the authors represented 13 different disciplines (3.2±1.5 disciplines per study). Pharmacy authors most commonly published with co-authors from nursing, medicine, and health management and support and most frequently served as first author or last author. The IPE activities involved 4.0 student disciplines (SD = 1.9) and 211.8 students (SD = 280.1), and most commonly included nursing (n = 104, 71.7\%), medicine (n = 102, 70.3\%), and health management and support students (n = 50, 34.5\%). Most studies did not include an author from each student discipline involved in the IPE (n = 88, 60.7\%). Further, a majority of studies used nonrandomized groupings (n = 103, 71.0\%) with quantitative data (n = 74, 51.0\%) and most were published in an interprofessional journal (n = 65, 44.8\%) or pharmacy-specific journal (n = 45, 31.0\%).
Summary. Pharmacists have increased their engagement in IPE research as demonstrated by the number of articles published and authorship order position. However, mismatches between student disciplines and author disciplines on published papers elucidate opportunities to foster collaborations that position students for success within a collaborative healthcare environment.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Treatments may be more effective in some patients than others, and individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis of randomized trials provides perhaps the best method of investigating treatment-covariate interactions. Various methods are used; we provide a comprehensive critique and develop guidance on method selection.
STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We searched MEDLINE to identify all frequentist methods and appraised them for simplicity, risk of bias, and power. IPD data sets were reanalyzed.
RESULTS: Four methodological categories were identified: PWT: pooling of within-trial covariate interactions; OSM: "one-stage" model with a treatment-covariate interaction term; TDCS: testing for difference between covariate subgroups in their pooled treatment effects; and CWA: combining PWT with meta-regression. Distinguishing across- and within-trial information is important, as the former may be subject to ecological bias. A strategy is proposed for method selection in different circumstances; PWT or CWA are natural first steps. The OSM method allows for more complex analyses; TDCS should be avoided. Our reanalysis shows that different methods can lead to substantively different findings.
CONCLUSION: The choice of method for investigating interactions in IPD meta-analysis is driven mainly by whether across-trial information is considered for inclusion, a decision, which depends on balancing possible improvement in power with an increased risk of bias.},

	abstract = {Differences across studies in terms of design features and methodology, clinical procedures, and patient characteristics, are factors that can contribute to variability in the treatment effect between studies in a meta-analysis (statistical heterogeneity). Regression modelling can be used to examine relationships between treatment effect and covariates with the aim of explaining the variability in terms of clinical, methodological, or other factors. Such an investigation can be undertaken using aggregate data or individual patient data. An aggregate data approach can be problematic as sufficient data are rarely available and translating aggregate effects to individual patients can often be misleading. An individual patient data approach, although usually more resource demanding, allows a more thorough investigation of potential sources of heterogeneity and enables a fuller analysis of time to event outcomes in meta-analysis. Hierarchical Cox regression models are used to identify and explore the evidence for heterogeneity in meta-analysis and examine the relationship between covariates and censored failure time data in this context. Alternative formulations of the model are possible and illustrated using individual patient data from a meta-analysis of five randomized controlled trials which compare two drugs for the treatment of epilepsy. The models are further applied to simulated data examples in which the degree of heterogeneity and magnitude of treatment effect are varied. The behaviour of each model in each situation is explored and compared.},

	abstract = {Meta-analyses using individual patient data are becoming increasingly common and have several advantages over meta-analyses of summary statistics. We explore the use of multilevel or hierarchical models for the meta-analysis of continuous individual patient outcome data from clinical trials. A general framework is developed which encompasses traditional meta-analysis, as well as meta-regression and the inclusion of patient-level covariates for investigation of heterogeneity. Unexplained variation in treatment differences between trials is considered as random. We focus on models with fixed trial effects, although an extension to a random effect for trial is described. The methods are illustrated on an example in Alzheimer's disease in a classical framework using SAS PROC MIXED and MLwiN, and in a Bayesian framework using BUGS. Relative merits of the three software packages for such meta-analyses are discussed, as are the assessment of model assumptions and extensions to incorporate more than two treatments.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Meta-analyses based on individual patient data (IPD) are regarded as the gold standard for systematic reviews. However, the methods used for analysing and presenting results from IPD meta-analyses have received little discussion.
METHODS: We review 44 IPD meta-analyses published during the years 1999-2001. We summarize whether they obtained all the data they sought, what types of approaches were used in the analysis, including assumptions of common or random effects, and how they examined the effects of covariates.
RESULTS: Twenty-four out of 44 analyses focused on time-to-event outcomes, and most analyses (28) estimated treatment effects within each trial and then combined the results assuming a common treatment effect across trials. Three analyses failed to stratify by trial, analysing the data is if they came from a single mega-trial. Only nine analyses used random effects methods. Covariate-treatment interactions were generally investigated by subgrouping patients. Seven of the meta-analyses included data from less than 80\% of the randomized patients sought, but did not address the resulting potential biases.
CONCLUSIONS: Although IPD meta-analyses have many advantages in assessing the effects of health care, there are several aspects that could be further developed to make fuller use of the potential of these time-consuming projects. In particular, IPD could be used to more fully investigate the influence of covariates on heterogeneity of treatment effects, both within and between trials. The impact of heterogeneity, or use of random effects, are seldom discussed. There is thus considerable scope for enhancing the methods of analysis and presentation of IPD meta-analysis.},

	abstract = {Summary. Systematic review and synthesis (meta-analysis) methods are now increasingly used in many areas of health care research. We investigate the potential usefulness of these methods for combining human and animal data in human health risk assessment of exposure to environmental chemicals. Currently, risk assessments are often based on narrative review and expert judgment, but systematic review and formal synthesis methods offer a more transparent and rigorous approach. The method is illustrated by using the example of trihalomethane exposure and its possible association with low birth weight. A systematic literature review identified 13 relevant studies (five epidemiological and eight toxicological). Study-specific dose–response slope estimates were obtained for each of the studies and synthesized by using Bayesian meta-analysis models. Sensitivity analyses of the results obtained to the assumptions made suggest that some assumptions are critical. It is concluded that systematic review methods should be used in the synthesis of evidence for environmental standard setting, that meta-analysis will often be a valuable approach in these contexts and that sensitivity analyses are an important component of the approach whether or not formal synthesis methods (such as systematic review and meta-analysis) are used.},

The plan contained many action steps that were aimed at improving the racial representativeness of clinical trials and enhancing the reporting of new drug side effects and benefits across diverse populations. Yet, relying on the FDA’s Drug Trials Snapshots website, we failed to find evidence that the action plan improved representation of Black trial participants. Black patients remained inadequately represented in clinical trials for drugs, with a median of one-third the enrollment that would be required, whether the trials were started before, during, or after the action plan. Fewer than 20 percent of drugs had data regarding treatment benefits or side effects reported for Black patients; neither measure improved during the action plan period.},

	abstract = {Background: In the last decade, network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials has been introduced as an extension of pairwise meta-analysis. The advantage of network meta-analysis over standard pairwise meta-analysis is that it facilitates indirect comparisons of multiple interventions that have not been studied in a head-to-head fashion. Although assumptions underlying pairwise meta-analyses are well understood, those concerning network meta-analyses are perceived to be more complex and prone to misinterpretation. Discussion: In this paper, we aim to provide a basic explanation when network meta-analysis is as valid as pairwise meta-analysis. We focus on the primary role of effect modifiers, which are study and patient characteristics associated with treatment effects. Because network meta-analysis includes different trials comparing different interventions, the distribution of effect modifiers cannot only vary across studies for a particular comparison (as with standard pairwise meta-analysis, causing heterogeneity), but also between comparisons (causing inconsistency). If there is an imbalance in the distribution of effect modifiers between different types of direct comparisons, the related indirect comparisons will be biased. If it can be assumed that this is not the case, network meta-analysis is as valid as pairwise meta-analysis. Summary: The validity of network meta-analysis is based on the underlying assumption that there is no imbalance in the distribution of effect modifiers across the different types of direct treatment comparisons, regardless of the structure of the evidence network.},

Meta-analysis plays an important role in the evaluation of the safety of medical products and has advantage over analyzing a single RCT when estimating the rate of adverse events.
Methods: In this article, we compare 15 widely used meta-analysis models under both Bayesian and frequentist frameworks when outcomes are extremely infrequent or rare. We present extensive simulation study results and then apply these methods to a real meta-analysis that considers RCTs investigating the effect of rosiglitazone on the risks of myocardial infarction and of death from cardiovascular causes.
Results: Our simulation studies suggest that the beta hyperprior method modeling treatment group-specific parameters and accounting for heterogeneity performs the best. Most models ignoring between-study heterogeneity give poor coverage probability when such heterogeneity exists. In the data analysis, different methods provide a wide range of log odds ratio estimates between rosiglitazone and control treatments with a mixed conclusion on their statistical significance based on 95\% confidence (or credible) intervals.
Conclusion: In the rare event setting, treatment effect estimates obtained from traditional meta-analytic methods may be biased and provide poor coverage probability. This trend worsens when the data have large between-study heterogeneity. In general, we recommend methods that first estimate the summaries of treatment-specific risks across studies and then relative treatment effects based on the summaries when appropriate.

We incorporate individual covariate-by-treatment interactions to facilitate personalized decision making. Furthermore, we can find subpopulations performing well with a certain drug in terms of predictive outcomes. We also impute missing individual covariates via an MCMC algorithm.

	abstract = {Objective: Two investigations evaluate Bayesian meta-regression for detecting treatment interactions. Study Design and Setting: The ﬁrst compares analyses of aggregate and individual patient data on 1,860 subjects from 11 trials testing angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for nondiabetic kidney disease. The second explores meta-regression for detecting treatment interaction on 671 covariates, including the baseline risk, from 232 meta-analyses of binary outcomes compiled from the Cochrane Collaboration and the medical literature.
Results: In the ACE inhibitor study, treatment effects were homogeneous so meta-regression identiﬁed no interactions. Analysis of individual patient data using a multilevel model, however, discovered that treatment reduced glomerular ﬁltration rate (GFR) more among patients with higher baseline proteinuria. The second investigation found meta-regression most effective for detecting treatment interactions with study-level factors in meta-analyses with Ͼ10 studies, heterogeneous treatment effects, or signiﬁcant overall treatment effects. Under all three conditions, 46\% of meta-regressions produced strong interactions (posterior probability Ͼ0.995) compared with 6\% otherwise. Baseline risk was associated with the odds ratio in 6\% of meta-analyses, half the rate found using maximum likelihood.
Conclusion: Meta-regression can detect interactions of treatment with study-level factors when treatment effects are heterogeneous. Individual patient data are needed for patient-level factors and homogeneous effects. Ć 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To compare meta-analysis of summary study level data with the equivalent individual patient data (IPD) analysis when interest lies in identification of binary patient characteristics related to treatment efficacy. Design: A simulation study comparing meta-regression with IPD analyses of randomized controlled trials. Methods: Twenty-seven different meta-analysis situations were simulated with 1000 repetitions in each case. The following parameters were varied: (1) the treatment effect magnitude for different patient risk groups; (2) sample sizes of individual studies; and (3) number of studies. The meta-regression and IPD results were then compared for each situation. Results: The statistical power of meta-regression was dramatically and consistently lower than that of IPD analysis, with little agreement between the parameter estimates obtained from the two methods. Only in meta-analyses of large numbers of large trials, did meta-regression detect differential treatment effects between risk groups with any consistency. Conclusions: Meta-analysis of summary data may be adequate when estimating a single pooled treatment effect or investigating study level characteristics. However, when interest lies in investigating whether patient characteristics are related to treatment, IPD analysis will generally be necessary to discover any such relationships. In these situations practitioners should try to obtain individual-level data. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Data from both a randomized trial and an observational study are sometimes simultaneously available for evaluating the eﬀect of an intervention. The randomized data typically allows for reliable estimation of average treatment eﬀects but may be limited in sample size and patient heterogeneity for estimating conditional average treatment eﬀects for a broad range of patients. Estimates from the observational study can potentially compensate for these limitations, but there may be concerns about whether confounding and treatment effect heterogeneity have been adequately addressed. We propose an approach for combining conditional treatment eﬀect estimators from each source such that it aggressively weights toward the randomized estimator when bias in the observational estimator is detected. This allows the combination to be consistent for a conditional causal eﬀect, regardless of whether assumptions required for consistent estimation in the observational study are satisﬁed. When the bias is negligible, the estimators from each source are combined for optimal eﬃciency. We show the problem can be formulated as a penalized least squares problem and consider its asymptotic properties. Simulations demonstrate the robustness and eﬃciency of the method in ﬁnite samples, in scenarios with bias or no bias in the observational estimator. We illustrate the method by estimating the eﬀects of hormone replacement therapy on the risk of developing coronary heart disease in data from the Women’s Health Initiative.},

	abstract = {With increasing data availability, causal treatment effects can be evaluated across different datasets, both randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies. RCTs isolate the effect of the treatment from that of unwanted (confounding) co-occurring effects. But they may struggle with inclusion biases, and thus lack external validity. On the other hand, large observational samples are often more representative of the target population but can conflate confounding effects with the treatment of interest. In this paper, we review the growing literature on methods for causal inference on combined RCTs and observational studies, striving for the best of both worlds. We first discuss identification and estimation methods that improve generalizability of RCTs using the representativeness of observational data. Classical estimators include weighting, difference between conditional outcome models, and doubly robust estimators. We then discuss methods that combine RCTs and observational data to improve (conditional) average treatment effect estimation, handling possible unmeasured confounding in the observational data. We also connect and contrast works developed in both the potential outcomes framework and the structural causal model framework. Finally, we compare the main methods using a simulation study and real world data to analyze the effect of tranexamic acid on the mortality rate in major trauma patients. Code to implement many of the methods is provided.},

This often requires network meta-analysis (NMA), which combines trials involving direct comparison of two interventions within the same trial and indirect comparisons across trials. In this paper, we extend existing network methods for main effects to examining moderator effects, allowing for tests of whether intervention effects vary for different populations or when employed in different contexts. In addition, we study how the use of individual participant data (IPD) may increase the sensitivity of NMA for detecting moderator effects, as compared to aggregate data NMA that employs study-level effect sizes in a meta-regression framework. A new network metaanalysis diagram is proposed. We also develop a generalized multilevel model for NMA that takes into account within- and between-trial heterogeneity, and can include participant-level covariates.},

	abstract = {Network meta-analysis (NMA) is a common approach to summarizing relative treatment effects from randomized trials with different treatment comparisons. Most NMAs are based on published aggregate data (AD) and have limited possibilities for investigating the extent of network consistency and between-study heterogeneity. Given that individual participant data (IPD) are considered the gold standard in evidence synthesis, we explored statistical methods for IPD-NMA and investigated their potential advantages and limitations, compared with AD-NMA. We discuss several one-stage random-effects NMA models that account for within-trial imbalances, treatment effect modifiers, missing response data and longitudinal responses. We illustrate all models in a case study of 18 antidepressant trials with a continuous endpoint (the Hamilton Depression Score). All trials suffered from drop-out; missingness of longitudinal responses ranged from 21 to 41\% after 6 weeks follow-up. Our results indicate that NMA based on IPD may lead to increased precision of estimated treatment effects. Furthermore, it can help to improve network consistency and explain between-study heterogeneity by adjusting for participant-level effect modifiers and adopting more advanced models for dealing with missing response data. We conclude that implementation of IPD-NMA should be considered when trials are affected by substantial drop-out rate, and when treatment effects are potentially influenced by participant-level covariates.},

We introduce a novel method of using limited experimental data to correct the hidden confounding in causal effect models trained on larger observational data, even if the observational data does not fully overlap with the experimental data. Our method makes strictly weaker assumptions than existing approaches, and we prove conditions under which it yields a consistent estimator.

	abstract = {Meta-analysis of individual patient data (IPD) is increasingly used to synthesize data from multiple trials. IPD meta-analysis offers several advantages over meta-analyzing aggregate data, including the capacity to individualize treatment recommendations. Trials usually collect information on many patient characteristics. Some of these covariates may strongly interact with treatment (and thus be associated with treatment effect modification) while others may have little effect. It is currently unclear whether a systematic approach to the selection of treatment-covariate interactions in an IPD meta-analysis can lead to better estimates of patient-specific treatment effects. We aimed to answer this question by comparing in simulations the standard approach to IPD meta-analysis (no variable selection, all treatment-covariate interactions included in the model) with six alternative methods: stepwise regression, and five regression methods that perform shrinkage on treatment-covariate interactions, that is, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), ridge, adaptive LASSO, Bayesian LASSO, and stochastic search variable selection. Exploring a range of scenarios, we found that shrinkage methods performed well for both continuous and dichotomous outcomes, for a variety of settings. In most scenarios, these methods gave lower mean squared error of the patient-specific treatment effect as compared with the standard approach and stepwise regression. We illustrate the application of these methods in two datasets from cardiology and psychiatry. We recommend that future IPD meta-analysis that aim to estimate patient-specific treatment effects using multiple effect modifiers should use shrinkage methods, whereas stepwise regression should be avoided.},

	abstract = {Background: Network meta-analysis (NMA) is a methodology for indirectly comparing, and strengthening direct comparisons of two or more treatments for the management of disease by combining evidence from multiple studies. It is sometimes not possible to perform treatment comparisons as evidence networks restricted to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) may be disconnected. We propose a Bayesian NMA model that allows to include single-arm, before-and-after, observational studies to complete these disconnected networks. We illustrate the method with an indirect comparison of treatments for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).
Methods: Our method uses a random effects model for placebo improvements to include single-arm observational studies into a general NMA. Building on recent research for binary outcomes, we develop a covariate-adjusted continuous-outcome NMA model that combines individual patient data (IPD) and aggregate data from two-arm RCTs with the single-arm observational studies. We apply this model to a complex comparison of therapies for PAH combining IPD from a phase-III RCT of imatinib as add-on therapy for PAH and aggregate data from RCTs and single-arm observational studies, both identified by a systematic review.
Results: Through the inclusion of observational studies, our method allowed the comparison of imatinib as add-on therapy for PAH with other treatments. This comparison had not been previously possible due to the limited RCT evidence available. However, the credible intervals of our posterior estimates were wide so the overall results were inconclusive. The comparison should be treated as exploratory and should not be used to guide clinical practice.
Conclusions: Our method for the inclusion of single-arm observational studies allows the performance of indirect comparisons that had previously not been possible due to incomplete networks composed solely of available RCTs. We also built on many recent innovations to enable researchers to use both aggregate data and IPD. This method could be used in similar situations where treatment comparisons have not been possible due to restrictions to RCT evidence and where a mixture of aggregate data and IPD are available.},

In a previous systematic review of articles published between 1999–2001, the statistical approach was seldom reported in sufficient detail, and the outcome was binary in 32\% of the studies considered. Here, we explore statistical methods used for IPD-MA of binary outcomes only, a decade later.
Methods: We selected 56 articles, published in 2011 that presented results from an individual patient data meta-analysis. Of these, 26 considered a binary outcome. Here, we review 26 IPD-MA published during 2011 to consider: the goal of the study and reason for conducting an IPD-MA, whether they obtained all the data they sought, the approach used in their analysis, for instance, a two-stage or a one stage model, and the assumption of fixed or random effects. We also investigated how heterogeneity across studies was described and how studies investigated the effects of covariates.
Results: 19 of the 26 IPD-MA used a one-stage approach. 9 IPD-MA used a one-stage random treatment-effect logistic regression model, allowing the treatment effect to vary across studies. Twelve IPD-MA presented some form of statistic to measure heterogeneity across studies, though these were usually calculated using two-stage approach. Subgroup analyses were undertaken in all IPD-MA that aimed to estimate a treatment effect or safety of a treatment,. Sixteen meta-analyses obtained 90\% or more of the patients sought.
Conclusion: Evidence from this systematic review shows that the use of binary outcomes in assessing the effects of health care problems has increased, with random effects logistic regression the most common method of analysis. Methods are still often not reported in enough detail. Results also show that heterogeneity of treatment effects is discussed in most applications.},

This paper develops federated methods that only utilize summary-level information from heterogeneous data sets. Our federated methods provide doubly-robust point estimates of treatment eﬀects as well as variance estimates. We derive the asymptotic distributions of our federated estimators, which are shown to be asymptotically equivalent to the corresponding estimators from the combined, individual-level data. We show that to achieve these properties, federated methods should be adjusted based on conditions such as whether models are correctly speciﬁed and stable across heterogeneous data sets.},

	abstract = {Parallel randomized trial (RT) and real-world (RW) data are becoming increasingly available for treatment evaluation. Given the complementary features of the RT and RW data, we propose a test-based elastic integrative analysis of the RT and RW data for accurate and robust estimation of the heterogeneity of treatment eﬀect (HTE), which lies at the heart of precision medicine. When the RW data are not subject to bias, e.g., due to unmeasured confounding, our approach combines the RT and RW data for optimal estimation by exploiting semiparametric eﬃciency theory. Utilizing the design advantage of RTs, we construct a built-in test procedure to gauge the reliability of the RW data and decide whether or not to use RW data in an integrative analysis. We characterize the asymptotic distribution of the test-based elastic integrative estimator under local alternatives, which provides a better approximation of the ﬁnite-sample behaviors of the test and estimator when the idealistic assumption required for the RW data is weakly violated. We provide a data-adaptive procedure to select the threshold of the test statistic that promises the smallest mean square error of the proposed estimator of the HTE. Lastly, we construct an elastic conﬁdence interval that has a good ﬁnitesample coverage property. We apply the proposed method to characterize who can beneﬁt from adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with stage IB non-small cell lung cancer.},

	abstract = {The heterogeneity of treatment eﬀect (HTE) lies at the heart of precision medicine. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are gold-standard to estimate the HTE but are typically underpowered. While real-world data (RWD) have large predictive power but are often confounded due to lack of randomization of treatment. In this article, we show that the RWD, even subject to hidden confounding, may be used to empower RCTs in estimating the HTE using the confounding function. The confounding function summarizes the impact of unmeasured confounders on the diﬀerence in the potential outcome between the treated and untreated groups, accounting for the observed covariates, which is unidentiﬁable based only on the RWD. Coupling the RCT and RWD, we show that the HTE and confounding function are identiﬁable. We then derive the semiparametric eﬃcient scores and integrative estimators of the HTE and confounding function. We clarify the conditions under which the integrative estimator of the HTE is strictly more eﬃcient than the RCT estimator. As a by-product, our framework can be used to generalize the average treatment eﬀects from the RCT to a target population without requiring an overlap covariate distribution assumption between the RCT and RWD. We illustrate the integrative estimators with a simulation study and an application.},

	abstract = {Network meta-analysis expands the scope of a conventional pairwise meta-analysis to simultaneously compare multiple treatments, synthesizing both direct and indirect information and thus strengthening inference. Since most of trials only compare two treatments, a typical data set in a network meta-analysis managed as a trial-by-treatment matrix is extremely sparse, like an incomplete block structure with significant missing data. Zhang et al. proposed an arm-based method accounting for correlations among different treatments within the same trial and assuming that absent arms are missing at random. However, in randomized controlled trials, nonignorable missingness or missingness not at random may occur due to deliberate choices of treatments at the design stage. In addition, those undertaking a network metaanalysis may selectively choose treatments to include in the analysis, which may also lead to missingness not at random. In this paper, we extend our previous work to incorporate missingness not at random using selection models. The proposed method is then applied to two network meta-analyses and evaluated through extensive simulation studies. We also provide comprehensive comparisons of a commonly used contrast-based method and the arm-based method via simulations in a technical appendix under missing completely at random and missing at random.},

The key idea is to consider, for each of the treatments under investigation, the subject’s potential outcome in each study or setting were he to receive that treatment. We consider four sources of heterogeneity: (1) response inconsistency, whereby a subject’s response to a given treatment would vary across different studies or settings, (2) the grouping of nonequivalent treatments, where two or more treatments are grouped and treated as a single treatment under the incorrect assumption that a subject’s responses to the different treatments would be identical, (3) nonignorable treatment assignment, and (4) response-related variability in the composition of subjects in different studies or settings. We then examine how these sources affect heterogeneity/homogeneity of conditional and unconditional treatment effects. To illustrate the utility of our approach, we re-analyze individual participant data from 29 randomized placebocontrolled studies on the cardiovascular risk of Vioxx, a Cox-2 selective nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drug approved by the FDA in 1999 for the management of pain and withdrawn from the market in 2004.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used to treat depression, but the rates, timing, and baseline predictors of remission in "real world" patients are not established. The authors' primary objectives in this study were to evaluate the effectiveness of citalopram, an SSRI, using measurement-based care in actual practice, and to identify predictors of symptom remission in outpatients with major depressive disorder.
METHOD: This clinical study included outpatients with major depressive disorder who were treated in 23 psychiatric and 18 primary care "real world" settings. The patients received flexible doses of citalopram prescribed by clinicians for up to 14 weeks. The clinicians were assisted by a clinical research coordinator in the application of measurement-based care, which included the routine measurement of symptoms and side effects at each treatment visit and the use of a treatment manual that described when and how to modify medication doses based on these measures. Remission was defined as an exit score of {\textless}or=7 on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) (primary outcome) or a score of {\textless}or=5 on the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, Self-Report (QIDS-SR) (secondary outcome). Response was defined as a reduction of {\textgreater}or=50\% in baseline QIDS-SR score.
RESULTS: Nearly 80\% of the 2,876 outpatients in the analyzed sample had chronic or recurrent major depression; most also had a number of comorbid general medical and psychiatric conditions. The mean exit citalopram dose was 41.8 mg/day. Remission rates were 28\% (HAM-D) and 33\% (QIDS-SR). The response rate was 47\% (QIDS-SR). Patients in primary and psychiatric care settings did not differ in remission or response rates. A substantial portion of participants who achieved either response or remission at study exit did so at or after 8 weeks of treatment. Participants who were Caucasian, female, employed, or had higher levels of education or income had higher HAM-D remission rates; longer index episodes, more concurrent psychiatric disorders (especially anxiety disorders or drug abuse), more general medical disorders, and lower baseline function and quality of life were associated with lower HAM-D remission rates.
CONCLUSIONS: The response and remission rates in this highly generalizable sample with substantial axis I and axis III comorbidity closely resemble those seen in 8-week efficacy trials. The systematic use of easily implemented measurement-based care procedures may have assisted in achieving these results.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: An important clinical question is how many patients with acute schizophrenia do not respond to antipsychotics despite being treated for adequate time and with an effective dose. However, up to date, the exact extent of the phenomenon remains unclear.
METHODS: We calculated the nonresponse and nonremission percentages using individual patient data from 16 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Six thousand two hundred twenty-one patients were assigned to one antipsychotic (amisulpride, flupenthixol, haloperidol, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, or ziprasidone) at an adequate dose; the response was assessed at 4-6 weeks. As various definitions of nonresponse have been used in the literature, we applied 4 different cut-offs covering the whole range of percent Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)/Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) reduction (≤0\%, {\textless}25\%, {\textless}50\%, {\textless}75\%).For symptomatic remission, we used the definition proposed by Andreasen without employing the time criterion.
RESULTS: The overall nonresponse for the cut-off of ≤0\% PANSS/BPRS reduction was 19.8\% (18.8\%-20.8\%); for the cut-off of {\textless}25\% reduction it was 43\% (41.7\%-44.3\%); for the cut-off of {\textless}50\% reduction it was 66.5\% (65.3\%-67.8\%); and for the cut-off of {\textless}75\% reduction it was 87\% (86\%-87.9\%). The overall percentage of no symptomatic remission was 66.9\% (65.7\%-68.1\%). Earlier onset of illness, lower baseline severity and the antipsychotic used were significantly associated with higher nonresponse percentages.
CONCLUSIONS: Nonresponse and nonremission percentages were notably high. Nevertheless, the patients in our analysis could represent a negative selection since they came from short-term RCTs and could have been treated before study inclusion; thus, further response may not have been observed. Observational studies on this important question are needed.},

Black patients remained inadequately represented in clinical trials for drugs, with a median of one-third the enrollment that would be required, whether the trials were started before, during, or after the action plan.

Such exploratory analyses are frequently undertaken with published, study-level data, using techniques of meta-analytic regression. Our goal was to explore a real-world example for which both published, group-level and individual patient-level data were available, and to compare the substantive conclusions reached by both methods. We studied the benefits of anti-lymphocyte antibody induction therapy among renal transplant patients in five randomized trials, focusing on whether there are subgroups of patients in whom therapy might prove particularly beneficial. Allograft failure within 5 years was the endpoint studied. We used a variety of analytic approaches to the group-level data, including weighted least-squares regression (N=5 studies), logistic regression (N=628, the total number of subjects), and a hierarchical Bayesian approach. We fit logistic regression models to the patient-level data. In the patient-level analysis, we found that treatment was significantly more effective among patients with elevated (20 per cent or more) panel reactive antibodies (PRA) than among patients without elevated PRA. These patients comprise a small (about 15 per cent of patients) subgroup of patients that benefited from therapy. The group-level analyses failed to detect this interaction. We recommend using individual patient data, when feasible, to study patient characteristics, in order to avoid the potential for ecological bias introduced by group-level analyses.},

	abstract = {Mounting evidence suggests that there is frequently considerable variation in the risk of the outcome of interest in clinical trial populations. These differences in risk will often cause clinically important heterogeneity in treatment effects (HTE) across the trial population, such that the balance between treatment risks and benefits may differ substantially between large identifiable patient subgroups; the "average" benefit observed in the summary result may even be non-representative of the treatment effect for a typical patient in the trial. Conventional subgroup analyses, which examine whether specific patient characteristics modify the effects of treatment, are usually unable to detect even large variations in treatment benefit (and harm) across risk groups because they do not account for the fact that patients have multiple characteristics simultaneously that affect the likelihood of treatment benefit. Based upon recent evidence on optimal statistical approaches to assessing HTE, we propose a framework that prioritizes the analysis and reporting of multivariate risk-based HTE and suggests that other subgroup analyses should be explicitly labeled either as primary subgroup analyses (well-motivated by prior evidence and intended to produce clinically actionable results) or secondary (exploratory) subgroup analyses (performed to inform future research). A standardized and transparent approach to HTE assessment and reporting could substantially improve clinical trial utility and interpretability.},

DESIGN: A simulation study comparing meta-regression with IPD analyses of randomized controlled trials.
METHODS: Twenty-seven different meta-analysis situations were simulated with 1000 repetitions in each case. The following parameters were varied: (1) the treatment effect magnitude for different patient risk groups; (2) sample sizes of individual studies; and (3) number of studies. The meta-regression and IPD results were then compared for each situation.
RESULTS: The statistical power of meta-regression was dramatically and consistently lower than that of IPD analysis, with little agreement between the parameter estimates obtained from the two methods. Only in meta-analyses of large numbers of large trials, did meta-regression detect differential treatment effects between risk groups with any consistency.
CONCLUSIONS: Meta-analysis of summary data may be adequate when estimating a single pooled treatment effect or investigating study level characteristics. However, when interest lies in investigating whether patient characteristics are related to treatment, IPD analysis will generally be necessary to discover any such relationships. In these situations practitioners should try to obtain individual-level data.},

We develop a federated adaptive causal estimation (FACE) framework to incorporate heterogeneous data from multiple sites to provide treatment eﬀect estimation and inference for a target population of interest. Our strategy is communication-eﬃcient and privacy-preserving and allows for ﬂexibility in the speciﬁcation of the target population. Our method accounts for site-level heterogeneity in the distribution of covariates through density ratio weighting. To safely aggregate estimates from all sites and avoid negative transfer, we introduce an adaptive procedure of weighing the estimators constructed using data from the target and source populations through a penalized regression on the inﬂuence functions, which achieves 1) consistency and 2) optimal eﬃciency. We illustrate FACE by conducting a comparative eﬀectiveness study of BNT162b2 (Pﬁzer) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccines on COVID-19 outcomes in U.S. veterans using electronic health records from ﬁve VA sites.},

Meta-regression can be used to estimate such interactions using published data, but it is known to lack statistical power, and is prone to bias. The use of individual patient data can improve estimation of such interactions, among other benefits, but it can be difficult and time-consuming to collect and analyse. This paper derives, under certain conditions, the power of meta-regression and IPD methods to detect treatment–covariate interactions. These power formulae are shown to depend on heterogeneity in the covariate distributions across studies.

	abstract = {Stratified medicine utilizes individual-level covariates that are associated with a differential treatment effect, also known as treatment-covariate interactions. When multiple trials are available, meta-analysis is used to help detect true treatment-covariate interactions by combining their data. Meta-regression of trial-level information is prone to low power and ecological bias, and therefore, individual participant data (IPD) meta-analyses are preferable to examine interactions utilizing individual-level information. However, one-stage IPD models are often wrongly specified, such that interactions are based on amalgamating within- and across-trial information. We compare, through simulations and an applied example, fixed-effect and random-effects models for a one-stage IPD meta-analysis of time-to-event data where the goal is to estimate a treatment-covariate interaction. We show that it is crucial to centre patient-level covariates by their mean value in each trial, in order to separate out within-trial and across-trial information. Otherwise, bias and coverage of interaction estimates may be adversely affected, leading to potentially erroneous conclusions driven by ecological bias. We revisit an IPD meta-analysis of five epilepsy trials and examine age as a treatment effect modifier. The interaction is -0.011 (95\% CI: -0.019 to -0.003; p = 0.004), and thus highly significant, when amalgamating within-trial and across-trial information. However, when separating within-trial from across-trial information, the interaction is -0.007 (95\% CI: -0.019 to 0.005; p = 0.22), and thus its magnitude and statistical significance are greatly reduced. We recommend that meta-analysts should only use within-trial information to examine individual predictors of treatment effect and that one-stage IPD models should separate within-trial from across-trial information to avoid ecological bias. © 2016 The Authors.

Treatment by covariate interactions can be included in MTC models to explore how the covariate modifies the treatment effects. If interactions exist, the assumptions underlying MTCs may be invalidated. For conventional pair-wise meta-analysis, important benefits regarding the investigation of such interactions, gained from using individual patient data (IPD) rather than aggregate data (AD), have been described. We aim to compare IPD MTC models including patient-level covariates with AD MTC models including study-level covariates. IPD and AD random-effects MTC models for dichotomous outcomes are specified. Three assumptions are made regarding the interactions (i.e. independent, exchangeable and common interactions). The models are applied to a dataset to compare four drugs for treating malaria (i.e. amodiaquine-artesunate, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHAPQ), artemether-lumefantrine and chlorproguanil-dapsone plus artesunate) using the outcome unadjusted treatment success at day 28. The treatment effects and regression coefficients for interactions from the IPD models were more precise than those from AD models. Using IPD, assuming independent or exchangeable interactions, the regression coefficient for chlorproguanil-dapsone plus artesunate versus DHAPQ was statistically significant and assuming common interactions, the common coefficient was significant; whereas using AD, no coefficients were significant. Using IPD, DHAPQ was the best drug; whereas using AD, the best drug varied. Using AD models, there was no evidence that the consistency assumption was invalid; whereas, the assumption was questionable based on the IPD models. The AD analyses were misleading.

Methods: We systematically searched for methodologies pertaining to the implementation of a causally explicit framework for meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and discussed the interpretation and scientific relevance of such causal estimands. We performed a systematic search in four databases to identify relevant methodologies, supplemented with hand-search. We included methodologies that described causality under counterfactuals and potential outcomes framework.
Results: We only identified three efforts explicitly describing a causal framework on meta-analysis of RCTs. Two approaches required individual participant data, while for the last one, only summary data were required. All three approaches presented a sufficient framework under which a meta-analytical estimate is identifiable and estimable. However, several conceptual limitations remain, mainly in regard to the data generation process under which the selected RCTs rise.
Conclusions: We undertook a review of methodologies on causal inference methods in meta-analyses. Although all identified methodologies provide valid causal estimates, there are limitations in the assumptions regarding the data generation process and sampling of the potential RCTs to be included in the meta-analysis which pose challenges to the interpretation and scientific relevance of the identified causal effects. Despite both causal inference and meta-analysis being extensively studied in the literature, limited effort exists of combining those two frameworks.},

However, it is unclear whether the aggregation of effect estimates across heterogeneous populations will be consistent for a meaningful parameter when not all treatments are evaluated on each population. Drawing from counterfactual theory and the causal inference framework, we define the population of interest in a network meta-analysis and define the target parameter under a series of nonparametric structural assumptions. This allows us to determine the requirements for identifiability of this parameter, enabling a description of the conditions under which network meta-analysis is appropriate and when it might mislead decision making. We then adapt several modeling strategies from the causal inference literature to obtain consistent estimation of the intervention-specific mean outcome and model-independent contrasts between treatments. Finally, we perform a reanalysis of a systematic review to compare the efficacy of antibiotics on suspected or confirmed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in hospitalized patients.},

They are the main source of evidence on the intended effects of some types of interventions and often provide the only evidence about the effects of interventions on long-term outcomes, rare events or adverse effects. Therefore, systematic reviews on the effects of interventions may include various types of non-randomized studies. In this second paper in a series, we address how review authors might articulate the particular non-randomized study designs they will include and how they might evaluate, in general terms, the extent to which a particular non-randomized study is at risk of important biases. We offer guidance for describing and classifying different non-randomized designs based on specific features of the studies in place of using non-informative study design labels. We also suggest criteria to consider when deciding whether to include non-randomized studies. We conclude that a taxonomy of study designs based on study design features is needed. Review authors need new tools specifically to assess the risk of bias for some non-randomized designs that involve a different inferential logic compared with parallel group trials.

In this article we develop a general class of two-step algorithms for heterogeneous treatment effect estimation in observational studies. First, we estimate marginal effects and treatment propensities to form an objective function that isolates the causal component of the signal. Then, we optimize this data-adaptive objective function. The proposed approach has several advantages over existing methods. From a practical perspective, our method is ﬂexible and easy to use: in both steps, any loss-minimization method can be employed, such as penalized regression, deep neural networks, or boosting; moreover, these methods can be ﬁne-tuned by cross-validation. Meanwhile, in the case of penalized kernel regression, we show that our method has a quasi-oracle property. Even when the pilot estimates for marginal effects and treatment propensities are not particularly accurate, we achieve the same error bounds as an oracle with prior knowledge of these two nuisance components. We implement variants of our approach based on penalized regression, kernel ridge regression, and boosting in a variety of simulation set-ups, and observe promising performance relative to existing baselines.},

	abstract = {Heterogeneous effect estimation plays a crucial role in causal inference, with applications across medicine and social science. Many methods for estimating conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) have been proposed in recent years, but there are important theoretical gaps in understanding if and when such methods are optimal. This is especially true when the CATE has nontrivial structure (e.g., smoothness or sparsity). Our work contributes in several main ways. First, we study a two-stage doubly robust CATE estimator and give a generic model-free error bound, which, despite its generality, yields sharper results than those in the current literature. We apply the bound to derive error rates in nonparametric models with smoothness or sparsity, and give sufficient conditions for oracle efficiency. Underlying our error bound is a general oracle inequality for regression with estimated or imputed outcomes, which is of independent interest; this is the second main contribution. The third contribution is aimed at understanding the fundamental statistical limits of CATE estimation. To that end, we propose and study a local polynomial adaptation of double-residual regression. We show that this estimator can be oracle efficient under even weaker conditions, if used with a specialized form of sample splitting and careful choices of tuning parameters. These are the weakest conditions currently found in the literature, and we conjecture that they are minimal in a minimax sense. We go on to give error bounds in the non-trivial regime where oracle rates cannot be achieved. Some finite-sample properties are explored with simulations.},

Such exploratory analyses are frequently undertaken with published, study-level data, using techniques of meta-analytic regression. Our goal was to explore a real-world example for which both published, group-level and individual patient-level data were available, and to compare the substantive conclusions reached by both methods. We studied the benefits of anti-lymphocyte antibody induction therapy among renal transplant patients in five randomized trials, focusing on whether there are subgroups of patients in whom therapy might prove particularly beneficial. Allograft failure within 5 years was the endpoint studied. We used a variety of analytic approaches to the group-level data, including weighted least-squares regression (N=5 studies), logistic regression (N=628, the total number of subjects), and a hierarchical Bayesian approach. We fit logistic regression models to the patient-level data. In the patient-level analysis, we found that treatment was significantly more effective among patients with elevated (20 per cent or more) panel reactive antibodies (PRA) than among patients without elevated PRA. These patients comprise a small (about 15 per cent of patients) subgroup of patients that benefited from therapy. The group-level analyses failed to detect this interaction. We recommend using individual patient data, when feasible, to study patient characteristics, in order to avoid the potential for ecological bias introduced by group-level analyses.

	abstract = {Background: In meta-analyses of clinical trials, clinicians are often interested in examining subset effects. Meta-regression of aggregated data is a usual approach for relating sources of variation in treatment effects to specific study characteristics. However, it is known that study-level analyses can lead to biased assessments and have some limitations in explaining the heterogeneity. An individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis offers several advantages for this purpose.
Methods: We compared some regression analyses of IPD with meta-regression analyses of the summarized data using a real-world example in order to investigate whether a binary patient characteristic is related to treatment effect. We used data from 10 randomized trials for non-small-cell lung cancer (n = 1355).
Results: For treatment · stage interaction in IPD regression analysis, none of the tests of interactions was statistically significant. The meta-regression analysis gave a greater P-value than the IPD analysis. When excluding two studies, which had only stage I patients, the interaction was also not statistically significant in IPD analysis. On the other hand, the result of meta-regression analysis, though also showing no significant relationship, revealed a clear reversal in the direction of effect.
Conclusion: We suggest that the results of meta-regression analyses would not be as robust as those of regression analyses using IPD in examining potential modifiers of treatment effects. To investigate whether patient characteristics are related to treatment effects, we suggest that interaction tests and sensitivity analyses using IPD should be employed whenever possible.},

Design: A simulation study comparing meta-regression with IPD analyses of randomized controlled trials.

The following parameters were varied: (1) the treatment effect magnitude for different patient risk groups; (2) sample sizes of individual studies; and (3) number of studies. The meta-regression and IPD results were then compared for each situation. Results: The statistical power of meta-regression was dramatically and consistently lower than that of IPD analysis, with little agreement between the parameter estimates obtained from the two methods. Only in meta-analyses of large numbers of large trials, did meta-regression detect differential treatment effects between risk groups with any consistency. Conclusions: Meta-analysis of summary data may be adequate when estimating a single pooled treatment effect or investigating study level characteristics.

        Neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES), beyond individual SES, has been associated with health behaviors and outcomes. We constructed a neighborhood SES index using readily available US Census variables and studied associations of the index with self-reported education, formal education, and neighborhood residential characteristics among adult enrollees of a managed care organization (MCO).
        Methods: 
        A neighborhood SES index was constructed for MCO enrollees using a principal components analysis of 7 Census measures of their residential tracts or block groups. Quartiles of resulting neighborhood SES scores were matched with self-reported education, household income, and neighborhood residential characteristics obtained on 3 surveys of MCO adults ranging in age from 18 to 99. Cross-tabulations of neighborhood SES with self-reported measures were used to assess concordance.
        Results: 
        Consistent with other non-MCO populations, distributions of the neighborhood SES index and self-reported education, household income, and other neighborhood residential characteristics were concordant. The presence of high SES MCO enrollees in low SES neighborhoods and low SES MCO enrollees in high SES neighborhoods was, however, common. MCO enrollees living in low SES neighborhoods also reported neighborhood problems (crime, unattended dogs) known to affect walkability more frequently than those living in high SES neighborhoods.
        Conclusions: 
        A simple, valid neighborhood SES index can be constructed for MCO populations using readily available US Census variables. Although individual and neighborhood SES are on average concordant, discrepancies between individual and neighborhood SES suggest that other factors may influence how area-based SES contributes to health behaviors and outcomes in an MCO population.},

	abstract = {Background and Objectives
Frailty is highly prevalent in later life and associated with early mortality and adverse health outcomes. The neighborhood has been identified as an important contributor to individual health, and neighborhood characteristics may contribute to frailty development. A scoping review was conducted of the peer-reviewed literature to better understand how physical and social neighborhood characteristics contribute to frailty.

Research Design and Methods
Following an established scoping review methodology, we searched four peer-reviewed databases for relevant studies published from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2018. Data extracted from studies included study characteristics, operationalization of neighborhood, the conceptual model of the neighborhood–frailty relationship, operationalization of frailty, and study findings for associations among neighborhood variables and frailty indicators.

Results
A total of 522 articles were identified and 13 articles were included in the final data charting. Existing studies suggest that neighborhood characteristics are associated with frailty in later life. Few studies articulated a conceptual model identifying exact mechanisms through which neighborhood factors affected frailty. Studies designs were mostly cross-sectional. Longitudinal studies did not measure neighborhood characteristics over time. Studies varied considerably in how they operationalized the neighborhood. Frailty was most commonly assessed using a 5-point phenotype or a frailty index approach.

Discussion and Implications
Findings indicate that research on the relationship between neighborhood characteristics and frailty is an emerging area of inquiry. Additional studies are needed to more definitely explicate mechanisms through which neighborhoods contribute to, or protect older adults from, frailty.},

The sample consisted of African American adults ages 21-85 with complete, geocoded data on CBR biomarkers and behavioral covariates (n=4,410). Neighborhood disadvantage was measured using a composite score of socioeconomic indicators from the 2000 US Census. Eight biomarkers representing cardiovascular, metabolic, inflammatory, and neuroendocrine systems were used to create a CBR score. We fit two-level linear regression models with random intercepts and included cross-level interaction terms between neighborhood disadvantage and individual SES.

Results
Living in a disadvantaged neighborhood was associated with greater CBR after covariate adjustment (B=0.18, SE: 0.07, p{\textless}0.05). Interactions showed a weaker association for individuals with ≤ high school education, but were not statistically significant.

Conclusion
Disadvantaged neighborhoods contribute to poor health among African American adults via cumulative biological risk. Policies directly addressing the socioeconomic conditions of these environments should be considered as viable options to reduce disease risk in this group and mitigate racial/ethnic health inequities.},

	abstract = {Objective
Little is known about the nature of the frailty syndrome in older Hispanics who are projected to be the largest minority older population by 2050. We examined prospectively the relationship between medical, psychosocial and neighborhood factors and increasing frailty in a community-dwelling sample of Mexican Americans over the age of 75.

Method
Based on a modified version of the Cardiovascular Health Study frailty index, we examined two-year follow up data from the Hispanic Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (H-EPESE) to ascertain the rates and determinants of increasing frailty among 2,069 Mexican American adults 75+ years of age at baseline.

Results
Respondents at risk of increasing frailty lived in a less ethnically dense Mexican-American neighborhood, were older, did not have private insurance or Medicare, had higher levels of medical conditions, had lower levels of cognitive functioning, and reported less positive affect.

Discussion
Personal as well as neighborhood characteristics confer protective effects on individual health in this representative, well characterized sample of older Mexican Americans. Potential mechanisms that may be implicated in the protective effect of ethnically homogenous communities are discussed.},

	abstract = {Objectives
Frailty, an aggregate expression of risk resulting from age- or disease-associated physiologic accumulation, is responsible for large economic and societal costs. Little is known about how the context in which older adult’s live may contribute to differences in frailty. This study clarifies the role of neighborhood structural characteristics and social processes for understanding declines in health status.

Method
Data from two waves of the National Social Life, Health and Aging Project were linked to tract-level information from the 2000 Census (n = 1,925). Frailty was measured with in-home assessments and self-report. Ordered logistic regressions were employed to estimate the role of tract-level structural and social process indicators at baseline on frailty at follow-up.

Results
Living in a neighborhood characterized with a higher density of African Americans and with more residential instability was associated with higher odds of frailty. Adults in neighborhoods with increasing levels of physical disorder had higher odds of frailty (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 1.20, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03, 1.39), while those exposed to more social cohesion had lower odds (AOR: 0.87, CI: 0.78, 0.97).

Discussion
For older adults, both neighborhood structural and social process characteristics appear to be independently associated with frailty.},

In this article, we develop a nonparametric causal forest for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects that extends Breiman’s widely used random forest algorithm. In the potential outcomes framework with unconfoundedness, we show that causal forests are pointwise consistent for the true treatment effect and have an asymptotically Gaussian and centered sampling distribution. We also discuss a practical method for constructing asymptotic confidence intervals for the true treatment effect that are centered at the causal forest estimates. Our theoretical results rely on a generic Gaussian theory for a large family of random forest algorithms. To our knowledge, this is the first set of results that allows any type of random forest, including classification and regression forests, to be used for provably valid statistical inference. In experiments, we find causal forests to be substantially more powerful than classical methods based on nearest-neighbor matching, especially in the presence of irrelevant covariates.},

We identify problems with current practice and highlight that semi-synthetic benchmark datasets, which (unlike real-world benchmarks used elsewhere in ML) do not necessarily reﬂect properties of real data, can systematically favor some algorithms over others – a fact that is rarely acknowledged but of immense relevance for interpretation of empirical results. Further, we argue that current evaluation metrics evaluate performance only for a small subset of possible use cases of CATE estimators, and discuss alternative metrics relevant for applications in personalized medicine. Additionally, we discuss alternatives for current benchmark datasets, and implications of our ﬁndings for benchmarking in CATE estimation.},

With few exceptions, these experiments have addressed the overall causal eﬀect of an intervention across the entire population, known as the average treatment eﬀect (ATE). A much broader set of questions can often be addressed by allowing for heterogeneous treatment eﬀects. We discuss methods for estimating such eﬀects developed in other disciplines and introduce key concepts, especially the conditional average treatment eﬀect (CATE), to the analysis of randomized experiments in political science. We expand on this literature by proposing an application of generalized additive models (GAMs) to estimate non-linear heterogeneous treatment eﬀects. We demonstrate the practical importance of these techniques by re-analyzing a major experimental study on voter mobilization and social pressure and a recent randomized experiment on voter registration and text messaging from the 2008 US election.},

Drawing on the statistical learning literature, we discuss Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART), method for analyzing treatment effect heterogeneity. BART automates the detection of nonlinear relationships and interactions, thereby reducing researchers' discretion when analyzing experimental data. These feature make BART an appealing "off-the-shelf' tool for survey experimenters who want to model systematic treatment effect heterogeneity in a flexible and robust manner.

	abstract = {Recent years have seen increasing interest in and attention to evidence-based practices, where the “evidence” generally comes from well-conducted randomized trials. However, while those trials yield accurate estimates of the effect of the intervention for the participants in the trial (known as “internal validity”), they do not always yield relevant information about the effects in a particular target population (known as “external validity”). This may be due to a lack of specification of a target population when designing the trial, difficulties recruiting a sample that is representative of a prespecified target population, or to interest in considering a target population somewhat different from the population directly targeted by the trial. This paper first provides an overview of existing design and analysis methods for assessing and enhancing the ability of a randomized trial to estimate treatment effects in a target population. It then provides a case study using one particular method, which weights the subjects in a randomized trial to match the population on a set of observed characteristics. The case study uses data from a randomized trial of school-wide positive behavioral interventions and supports (PBIS); our interest is in generalizing the results to the state of Maryland. In the case of PBIS, after weighting, estimated effects in the target population were similar to those observed in the randomized trial. The paper illustrates that statistical methods can be used to assess and enhance the external validity of randomized trials, making the results more applicable to policy and clinical questions. However, there are also many open research questions; future research should focus on questions of treatment effect heterogeneity and further developing these methods for enhancing external validity. Researchers should think carefully about the external validity of randomized trials and be cautious about extrapolating results to specific populations unless they are confident of the similarity between the trial sample and that target population.},

	abstract = {Inferences from different data sources can often be fused together, a process referred to as “fusion learning,” to yield more powerful findings than those from individual data sources alone. Effective fusion learning approaches are in growing demand as increasing number of data sources have become easily available in this big data era. This article proposes a new fusion learning approach, called “iFusion,” for drawing efficient individualized inference by fusing learnings from relevant data sources. Specifically, iFusion (i) summarizes inferences from individual data sources as individual confidence distributions (CDs); (ii) forms a clique of individuals that bear relevance to the target individual and then combines the CDs from those relevant individuals; and, finally, (iii) draws inference for the target individual from the combined CD. In essence, iFusion strategically “borrows strength” from relevant individuals to enhance the efficiency of the target individual inference while preserving its validity. This article focuses on the setting where each individual study has a number of observations but its inference can be further improved by incorporating additional information from similar studies that is referred to as its clique. Under the setting, iFusion is shown to achieve oracle property under suitable conditions. It is also shown to be flexible and robust in handling heterogeneity arising from diverse data sources. The development is ideally suited for goaldirected applications. Computationally, iFusion is parallel in nature and scales up easily for big data. An efficient scalable algorithm is provided for implementation. Simulation studies and a real application in financial forecasting are presented. In effect, this article covers methodology, theory, computation, and application for individualized inference by iFusion.},

	abstract = {As data sets of related studies become more easily accessible, combining data sets of similar studies is often undertaken in practice to achieve a larger sample size and higher power. A major challenge arising from data integration pertains to data heterogeneity in terms of study population, study design, or study coordination. Ignoring such heterogeneity in data analysis may result in biased estimation and misleading inference. Traditional techniques of remedy to data heterogeneity include the use of interactions and random eﬀects, which are inferior to achieving desirable statistical power or providing a meaningful interpretation, especially when a large number of smaller data sets are combined. In this paper, we propose a regularized fusion method that allows us to identify and merge inter-study homogeneous parameter clusters in regression analysis, without the use of hypothesis testing approach. Using the fused lasso, we establish a computationally eﬃcient procedure to deal with large-scale integrated data. Incorporating the estimated parameter ordering in the fused lasso facilitates computing speed with no loss of statistical power. We conduct extensive simulation studies and provide an application example to demonstrate the performance of the new method with a comparison to the conventional methods.},

	abstract = {Objective: Vortioxetine (Lu AA21004) is an investigational antidepressant. In vitro studies indicate that vortioxetine is a 5-HT3, 5-HT7, and 5-HT1D receptor antagonist, 5-HT1B receptor partial agonist, 5-HT1A receptor agonist and inhibitor of the 5-HT transporter. This trial assessed the efficacy and tolerability of 2.5 and 5 mg vortioxetine for the treatment of MDD. Research design and methods: Adults (N ¼ 611) with MDD were randomized to 8 weeks of double-blind treatment with placebo, vortioxetine (2.5 or 5 mg) or active reference (duloxetine 60 mg). The primary measure was change from baseline in the 24-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D24). Secondary endpoints included responder rate, Clinical Global Impression Scale-Global Improvement scale (CGI-I), and remission rate. Participants were monitored for adverse events (AEs), and treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction using the Arizona Sexual Experiences (ASEX) scale.
Results: Both doses of vortioxetine were associated with declines in HAM-D24 total scores compared to placebo but were not statistically significant. At 8 weeks, changes from baseline were [mean (SE)]: À10.50 (0.76) placebo, À12.04 (0.74) 2.5 mg vortioxetine, and À11.08 (0.74) 5 mg vortioxetine. Secondary outcome measures in the vortioxetine groups, including responder rate, CGI-I, and remission rate, were also not significantly different from placebo. Duloxetine treatment was associated with declines in HAM-D24 total score [À13.47(0.75); p ¼ 0.005] as well as significant improvements in secondary outcome measures versus placebo (p 0.05). The most common AEs for vortioxetine were nausea, dry mouth, and headache. Rates of sexual dysfunction (ASEX) were 51.0\%, 37.5\%, 46.9\%, and 33.3\% in the vortioxetine 2.5 mg, vortioxetine 5 mg, duloxetine, and placebo groups, respectively.
Conclusions: In this study of adults with MDD treated for 8 weeks with vortioxetine 2.5 mg or 5 mg per day, reductions in depression symptoms were not statistically significant compared with placebo. Study limitations are discussed, including patient characteristics, MDD severity, drug dosing, and aspects of trial design. Both doses of vortioxetine were well tolerated.},

    "abstract": "A set $S\\subseteq V$ of vertices of a graph $G$ is a \\emph{$c$-clustered set} if it induces a subgraph with components of order at most $c$ each, and $α_c(G)$ denotes the size of a largest $c$-clustered set. For any graph $G$ on $n$ vertices and treewidth $k$, we show that $α_c(G) \\geq \\frac{c}{c+k+1}n$, which improves a result of Wood [arXiv:2208.10074, August 2022], while we construct $n$-vertex graphs $G$ of treewidth~$k$ with $α_c(G)\\leq \\frac{c}{c+k}n$. In the case $c\\leq 2$ or $k=1$ we prove the better lower bound $α_c(G) \\geq \\frac{c}{c+k}n$, which settles a conjecture of Chappell and Pelsmajer [Electron.\\ J.\\ Comb., 2013] and is best-possible. Finally, in the case $c=3$ and $k=2$, we show $α_c(G) \\geq \\frac{5}{9}n$ and which is best-possible.",

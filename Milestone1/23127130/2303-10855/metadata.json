    "abstract": "The wave spin of an electron can be fully characterized by the current density calculated from the exact four-spinor solution of the Dirac equation. In the excited states of the electron in a magnetic field-free quantum well, the current density has a multiple vortex topology. The interaction of the current with a magnetic potential produces a finer structure of anomalous Zeeman splitting. When the magnetic potential is comparable to the size of the individual vortices, fractional or zero spin effects can be observed.",

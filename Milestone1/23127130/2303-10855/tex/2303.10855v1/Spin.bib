ABSTRACT = {Herein, we have discussed three major methods which have been generally employed for the generation of optical beams with orbital angular momentum (OAM). These methods include the practice of diffractive optics elements (DOEs), metasurfaces (MSs), and photonic integrated circuits (PICs) for the production of in-plane and out-of-plane OAM. This topic has been significantly evolved as a result; these three methods have been further implemented efficiently by different novel approaches which are discussed as well. Furthermore, development in the OAM detection techniques has also been presented. We have tried our best to bring novel and up-to-date information to the readers on this interesting and widely investigated topic.},

abstract="Life is characterized by broken mirror symmetry (P{\'a}lyi et al., 1999). On the molecular level, proteins are composed almost exclusively of L-amino acids while nucleic acids only contain D-sugars. Without this chiral asymmetry, prebiotic molecular complexity leading to the formation of biologically active polymers could probably not have evolved (Joyce et al., 1984; Avetisov and Goldanskii, 1991). Nevertheless, more than 1{\textonehalf} century after Pasteur's discovery, the origin of biomolecular chiral asymmetry is still a mystery. Meanwhile, it is accepted that homochirality has already appeared early during chemical evolution and that a homochiral molecular environment was rather a pre-condition than a consequence of life (Keszthelyi, 1995; Avalos et al., 2000). Parity violation (MacDermott, 1993) and other chiral factors such as circularly polarized light are omnipresent and can lead under favorable conditions to enantio-meric enrichment. However, this enhancement usually remains tiny and can be annihilated by long-term racemization processes.",

    "abstract": "The study of interaction between electromagnetism and elementary particles is a long-standing topic in physics. Likewise, the connection between particle physics and emergent phenomena in condensed matter physics is a recurring theme and condensed matter physics has often provided a platform for investigating the interplay between particles and fields in cases that have not been observed in high-energy physics, so far. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we provide a new example of this by visualizing the electronic structure of a noncentrosymmetric magnetic Weyl semimetal candidate NdAlSi in both the paramagnetic and ferrimagnetic states. We observe surface Fermi arcs and bulk Weyl fermion dispersion as well as the regulation of Weyl fermions by ferrimagnetism. Our results establish NdAlSi as a magnetic Weyl semimetal and provide the first experimental observation of ferrimagnetic regulation of Weyl fermions in condensed matter.",

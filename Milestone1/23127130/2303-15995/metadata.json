    "abstract": "With the increasing complexity of time-delayed systems, the diversification of boundary types of chemical reaction systems poses a challenge for persistence analysis. This paper focuses on delayed complex balanced mass action systems (DeCBMAS) and derives that some boundaries of a DeCBMAS can not contain an $ω$-limit point of some trajectory with positive initial point by using the method of semilocking set decomposition and the property of the facet, further expanding the range of persistence of delayed complex balanced systems. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of semilocking set decomposition to address the complex boundaries and offer insights into the persistence analysis of delayed chemical reaction network systems.",

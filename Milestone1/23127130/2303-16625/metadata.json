    "abstract": "In this paper, we examine the energy consumption of a user equipment (UE) when it transmits a finite-sized data packet. The receiving base station (BS) controls a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) that can be utilized to improve the channel conditions, if additional pilot signals are transmitted to configure the RIS. We derive a formula for the energy consumption taking both the pilot and data transmission powers into account. By dividing the RIS into subarrays consisting of multiple RIS elements using the same reflection coefficient, the pilot overhead can be tuned to minimize the energy consumption while maintaining parts of the aperture gain. Our analytical results show that there exists an energy-minimizing subarray size. For small data blocks and when the channel conditions between the BS and UE are favorable compared to the path to the RIS, the energy consumption is minimized using large subarrays. When the channel conditions to the RIS are better and the data blocks are large, it is preferable to use fewer elements per subarray and potentially configure the elements individually.",

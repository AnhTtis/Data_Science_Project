    "abstract": "Monitored quantum circuits allow for unprecedented dynamical control of many-body entanglement. Here we show that random, measurement-only circuits, implementing the competition of bond and plaquette couplings of the Kitaev honeycomb model, give rise to a structured volume-law entangled phase with subleading $L \\ln L$ liquid scaling behavior. This interacting Majorana liquid takes up a highly-symmetric, spherical parameter space within the entanglement phase diagram obtained when varying the relative coupling probabilities. The sphere itself is a critical boundary with quantum Lifshitz scaling separating the volume-law phase from proximate area-law phases, a color code or a toric code. An exception is a set of tricritical, self-dual points exhibiting effective (1+1)d conformal scaling at which the volume-law phase and both area-law phases meet. From a quantum information perspective, our results define error thresholds for the color code in the presence of projective error and stochastic syndrome measurements. We show that an alternative realization of our model circuit can be implemented using unitary gates plus ancillary single-qubit measurements only.",

    "abstract": "We propose a counter-example guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS) scheme for the design of control Lyapunov functions and associated state-feedback controllers for linear systems affected by parametric uncertainty with arbitrary shape. In the CEGIS framework, a learner iteratively proposes a candidate control Lyapunov function and a tailored controller by solving a linear matrix inequality (LMI) feasibility problem, while a verifier either falsifies the current candidate by producing a counter-example to be considered at the next iteration, or it certifies that the tentative control Lyapunov function actually enjoys such feature. We investigate the Lipschitz continuity property of the global optimization problem solved by the verifier, which is key to establish the convergence of our method in a finite number of iterations. Numerical simulations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

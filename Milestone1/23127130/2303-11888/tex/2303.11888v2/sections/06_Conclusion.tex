\section{Conclusion}
The key points for the performance of end-to-end autonomous driving are improving fusion technologies and policy learning methods. These two points turn into two important questions. How to efficiently extract and integrate the features from different modalities? How to effectively use these features to learn a stable and well-performing policy approaching or even surpassing the human level. In this paper,  we contribute to the abovementioned aspects and achieve state-of-the-art performance. Compared to modular autonomous driving technologies, end-to-end autonomous driving has lower hardware costs and less expensive maintenance. It is also adaptable to different scenarios simply by feeding data. We believe end-to-end autonomous driving can be deployed in actual vehicles in the near future.

    "abstract": "In recent times, there has been a growing focus on end-to-end autonomous driving technologies. This technology involves the replacement of the entire driving pipeline with a single neural network, which has a simpler structure and faster inference time. However, while this approach reduces the number of components in the driving pipeline, it also presents challenges related to interpretability and safety. For instance, the trained policy may not always comply with traffic rules, and it is difficult to determine the reason for such misbehavior due to the lack of intermediate outputs. Additionally, the successful implementation of autonomous driving technology heavily depends on the reliable and expedient processing of sensory data to accurately perceive the surrounding environment. In this paper, we provide penalty-based imitation learning approach combined with cross semantics generation sensor fusion technologies (P-CSG) to efficiently integrate multiple modalities of information and enable the autonomous agent to effectively adhere to traffic regulations. Our model undergoes evaluation within the Town 05 Long benchmark, where we observe a remarkable increase in the driving score by more than 12% when compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) model, InterFuser. Notably, our model achieves this performance enhancement while achieving a 7-fold increase in inference speed and reducing the model size by approximately 30%.

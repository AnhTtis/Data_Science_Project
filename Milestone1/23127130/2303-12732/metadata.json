    "abstract": "Unfinished buildings are a constant throughout the history of architecture and have given rise to intense debates on the opportuneness of their completion, in addition to offering alibis for theorizing about the compositional possibilities in coherence with the finished parts. The development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) opens new avenues for the proposal of possibilities for the completion of unfinished architectures. Specifically, with the recent appearance of tools such as DALL-E, capable of completing images guided by a textual description, it is possible to count on the help of AI for architectural design tasks. In this article we explore the use of these new AI tools for the completion of unfinished facades of historical temples and analyse the still germinal stadium in the field of architectural graphic composition.",

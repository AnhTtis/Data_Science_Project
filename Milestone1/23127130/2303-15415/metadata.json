    "abstract": "Mainstream food delivery platforms, like DoorDash and Uber Eats, have been the locus of fierce policy debates about their unfair business and labor practices. At the same time, hundreds of independent food delivery services provide alternative opportunities to many communities across the U.S. We surveyed operators of independent food delivery platforms to learn about their perception of the role of public policy. We found conflicting opinions on whether and how policy should interact with their businesses, ranging from not wanting policymakers to interfere to articulating specific policies that would curtail mainstream platforms' business practices. We provide insights for technologists and policymakers interested in the sociotechnical challenges of local marketplaces.",

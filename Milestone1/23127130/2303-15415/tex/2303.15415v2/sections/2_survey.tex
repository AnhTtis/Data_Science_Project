\section{Survey and results}
We launched a survey in collaboration with the RMDA (Restaurant Marketing Delivery Association), a nonprofit organization of independent food delivery services. We distributed our survey through the RMDA's member mailing list. In the survey, we asked multiple-choice, and open-ended questions about the challenges indie platforms are facing and what kind of support they need to tackle the challenges from the public policy perspective. In this workshop paper, we share the results of two of the questions that concern public policy:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item  Which of the following challenges is [name of their platform] facing? Select all that apply.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Shortage of restaurants
            \item Too many restaurants want to sign up
            \item Shortage of couriers, e.g., drivers
            \item Oversupply of couriers, e.g., drivers
            \item Shortage of employees
            \item Too many delivery services and not enough customers
            \item Low volume of orders
            \item Shortage of customers
            \item Lack of funding
            \item Others (please specify)
        \end{itemize}
    \item (Open-ended question) How could policymakers help [the name of their platform] tackle the challenges it faces, if at all?
\end{enumerate}

Twenty-four platform operators responded. We conducted a thematic analysis of their responses to the open-ended questions, and we report on the results in the following section.

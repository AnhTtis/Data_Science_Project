\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we shared the survey results for the challenges indie platforms face and their opinions and needs toward public policy. We observed divided opinions about whether to involve policymakers in the food delivery market: interest to change the status quo with public policy and the belief that public policy should make no invention to the market.
In addition, we discussed the limitation of our paper and raise the question to the HCI community about how to integrate two-sided opinions into the design of public technology. Lastly, we proposed design implications about easily-adapted technologies to reflect diverse opinions.

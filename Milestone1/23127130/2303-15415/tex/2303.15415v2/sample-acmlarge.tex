\begin{abstract}
%Recent studies have shown that independent food delivery services are a widespread fixture of the food delivery landscape in the United States but are under-studied and under-supported. 
Mainstream food delivery platforms, like DoorDash and Uber Eats, have been the locus of fierce policy debates about their unfair business and labor practices. At the same time, hundreds of independent food delivery services provide alternative opportunities to many communities across the U.S. We surveyed operators of independent food delivery platforms to learn about their perception of the role of public policy. We found conflicting opinions on whether and how policy should interact with their businesses, ranging from not wanting policymakers to interfere to articulating specific policies that would curtail mainstream platforms' business practices. 
%We hope our research on the food delivery industry could bring awareness of the conflicted arguments from stakeholders in the food delivery industry and could be generalized to other marketplace areas. 
We provide insights for technologists and policymakers interested in the sociotechnical challenges of local marketplaces.

RoConE incorporates the learning of potential KG relation patterns into the existing query embedding model for solving logical queries. We provide initial proof of the efficiency of relation patterns to complex reasoning via both theoretical explanations and experiments. One limitation of RoConE is that the relational rotating projection can not be generalized to other geometric query embedding methods, except for cone embedding, due to the restriction of natural geometry properties. For future work, we will propose more general and effective strategies to enhance the learning of relation patterns in the complex query reasoning task.

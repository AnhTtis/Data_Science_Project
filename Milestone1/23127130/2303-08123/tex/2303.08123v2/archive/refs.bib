abstract = {Several combinatorial methods have been developed to create focused or diverse chemical libraries with a wide range of linear or macrocyclic chemical molecules: peptides, non-peptide oligomers, peptidomimetics, small-molecules, and natural product-like organic molecules. Each combinatorial approach has its own unique high-throughput screening and encoding strategy. In this article, we provide a brief overview of combinatorial chemistry in drug discovery with emphasis on recently developed new technologies for design, synthesis, screening and decoding of combinatorial library. Examples of successful application of combinatorial chemistry in hit discovery and lead optimization are given. The limitations and strengths of combinatorial chemistry are also briefly discussed. We are now in a better position to truly leverage the power of combinatorial technologies for the discovery and development of next-generation drugs.},

abstract = {There has been an exponential growth in the performance and output of sequencing technologies (omics data) with full genome sequencing now producing gigabases of reads on a daily basis. These data may hold the promise of personalized medicine, leading to routinely available sequencing tests that can guide patient treatment decisions. In the era of high-throughput sequencing (HTS), computational considerations, data governance and clinical translation are the greatest rate-limiting steps. To ensure that the analysis, management and interpretation of such extensive omics data is exploited to its full potential, key factors, including sample sourcing, technology selection and computational expertise and resources, need to be considered, leading to an integrated set of high-performance tools and systems. This article provides an up-to-date overview of the evolution of HTS and the accompanying tools, infrastructure and data management approaches that are emerging in this space, which, if used within in a multidisciplinary context, may ultimately facilitate the development of personalized medicine.},

	optimization is a problem in IMRT. In a previous publication we showed

	Recently the so-called direct aperture optimization method has been

	present paper is to present in detail the integration of the inverse
	kernel method into direct aperture optimization. It can be shown
	that this integration leads to a system with high performance with
	regard to time, while Monte Carlo precision is maintained. The integrated
	simulated annealing optimization algorithm allows easy adaptation
	to any multi-leaf collimator and it is open to any complex objective
	function. Investigations of simulated annealing control parameters
	are performed to improve the performance. The system denoted by direct
	Monte Carlo optimization (DMCO) is demonstrated on the Carpet phantom
	and a clinical prostate case as well. Results are compared to inverse
	kernel optimizations, showing a remarkable time reduction and simultaneously
	an improvement in plan quality for the Carpet phantom.},

	repair rates following low or high linear energy transfer (LET) irradiations
	and to assess the amount of unrepairable damage produced by such

	designed to test if low-LET radiation repair processes could be quantified
	in terms of second-order kinetics. The newer version allows calculation
	of both the repair rate of the proportion of DNA damages that repair
	according to second-order kinetics and the proportion of DNA damages
	that do not repair.The original and present models are intercompared
	in terms of their goodness-of-fit to a number of data sets obtained
	from different ion beams. The analysis demonstrates that the present
	model provides a better fit to the data in all cases studied.The
	proportions of unrepairable damage created by radiations of different
	LET predicted by the new model correspond well with previous studies
	on the increased effectiveness of high-LET radiations in inducing
	reproductive cell death. The results show that the original model
	may underestimate the proportion of unrepaired damage at any given
	time after its creation as well as failing to predict very slow or
	unrepairable damage components, which may result from high-LET irradiation.It
	is suggested that the second-order model presented here offers a
	more realistic view of the patterns of repair in cell lines or tissues
	exposed to high-LET radiation.},

	In order to use MR imaging alone for treatment planning the effect
	of residual MR distortions on external patient contour determination,

	must be investigated and corrected. In this work, we performed phantom
	measurements to quantify MR system related residual geometric distortions

	with larger lateral dimensions (>36 cm), the differences in patient
	external contours between distortion-free CT images and GDC-corrected
	MR images were 1-2 cm because of the combination of greater gradient
	distortion and loss of field homogeneity away from the isocentre
	and the uncertainties in patient setup during CT and MRI scans. The
	measured distortion maps were used to perform point-by-point corrections
	for patients with large dimensions inside the effective FOV. Using
	the point-by-point method, the geometrical distortion after the GDC

	were treated to 3000 rads (cGy) in 3 weeks but others received 4000
	in 5 or 6000 in 6 weeks. When I asked why, there were no convincing
	answers given, except 'this is what we usually do'. It wasn't until
	I went to a course on 'Radiobiology for Radiotherapy' in Cambridge
	that I learnt about the basic theories of Douglas Lea and the very
	considerable history of research into radiobiology and clinical radiotherapy.
	And there were still some questions outstanding, such as the relative
	importance of intracellular repair between 'daily' fractions, whether
	a 2 day gap each week was a good or a bad idea, and the role of proliferation,
	if any, during irradiation. I thought that a few simple animal experiments
	might help to give answers! That led me to a continuing interest
	in these questions and answers, which has taken me more than 50 years
	to pursue. This is the very personal story of what I saw happening
	in the subject, decade by decade. I was happy to experience all this
	together with scientists in many other countries, and our own, along
	the way.},

	in high-dose-per-fraction radiotherapy in comparison with the linear-quadratic
	(LQ) model. Cell survival data of V79 and EMT6 single cells receiving
	single doses of 2-12 Gy or 2 or 3 fractions of 4 or 5 Gy each, and
	that of V79 spheroids receiving single doses of 5-26 Gy or 2-5 fractions
	of 5-12 Gy, were analyzed. Single and fractionated doses to actually
	reduce cell survival to the same level were determined by a colony
	assay. Single doses used in the experiments and surviving fractions
	at the doses were substituted into equations of the RCR, MT and LQ
	models in the calculation software Mathematica, and each parameter
	coefficient was computed. Thereafter, using the coefficients and
	the three models, equivalent single doses for the hypofractionated
	doses were calculated. They were then compared with actually-determined
	equivalent single doses for the hypofractionated doses. The equivalent
	single doses calculated using the RCR, MT and LQ models tended to
	be lower than the actually determined equivalent single doses. The
	LQ model seemed to fit relatively well at doses of 5 Gy or less.
	At 6 Gy or higher doses, the RCR and MT models seemed to be more
	reliable than the LQ model. In hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy,
	the LQ model should not be used, and conversion models incorporating
	the concept of the RCR or MT models, such as the generalized linear-quadratic
	models, appear to be more suitable.},

	(IMRT) planning. In AGA, the best individual of the current population
	is found at first, and the rest of the normal individuals approach
	the current best one according to some specially designed rules.
	In the course of approaching, some better individuals may be obtained.
	Then, the current best individual is updated to try to approach the
	real best one. The approaching and updating operations of AGA replace
	the selection, crossover and mutation operations of the genetic algorithm
	(GA) completely. Using the specially designed updating strategies,
	AGA can recover the varieties of the population to a certain extent
	and retain the powerful ability of evolution, compared to GA. The
	beam angles are selected using AGA, followed by a beam intensity
	map optimization using conjugate gradient (CG). A simulated case
	and a clinical case with nasopharynx cancer are employed to demonstrate
	the feasibility of AGA. For the case investigated, AGA was feasible
	for the beam angle optimization (BAO) problem in IMRT planning and
	converged faster than GA.},

  abstract = {We present a novel framework that enables very large scale intensity-modulated
	radiation therapy (IMRT) planning in limited computation resources
	with improvements in cost, plan quality and planning throughput.
	Current IMRT optimization uses a voxel-based beamlet superposition
	(VBS) framework that requires pre-calculation and storage of a large
	amount of beamlet data, resulting in large temporal and spatial complexity.
	We developed a non-voxel-based broad-beam (NVBB) framework for IMRT
	capable of direct treatment parameter optimization (DTPO). In this
	framework, both objective function and derivative are evaluated based
	on the continuous viewpoint, abandoning 'voxel' and 'beamlet' representations.
	Thus pre-calculation and storage of beamlets are no longer needed.
	The NVBB framework has linear complexities (O(N(3))) in both space
	and time. The low memory, full computation and data parallelization
	nature of the framework render its efficient implementation on the
	graphic processing unit (GPU). We implemented the NVBB framework
	and incorporated it with the TomoTherapy treatment planning system
	(TPS). The new TPS runs on a single workstation with one GPU card
	(NVBB-GPU). Extensive verification/validation tests were performed
	in house and via third parties. Benchmarks on dose accuracy, plan
	quality and throughput were compared with the commercial TomoTherapy
	TPS that is based on the VBS framework and uses a computer cluster
	with 14 nodes (VBS-cluster). For all tests, the dose accuracy of
	these two TPSs is comparable (within 1\%). Plan qualities were comparable
	with no clinically significant difference for most cases except that
	superior target uniformity was seen in the NVBB-GPU for some cases.
	However, the planning time using the NVBB-GPU was reduced many folds
	over the VBS-cluster. In conclusion, we developed a novel NVBB framework
	for IMRT optimization. The continuous viewpoint and DTPO nature of
	the algorithm eliminate the need for beamlets and lead to better
	plan quality. The computation parallelization on a GPU instead of
	a computer cluster significantly reduces hardware and service costs.
	Compared with using the current VBS framework on a computer cluster,
	the planning time is significantly reduced using the NVBB framework
	on a single workstation with a GPU card.},

  abstract = {Inherently, IMRT treatment planning involves compromising between
	different planning goals. Multi-criteria IMRT planning directly addresses
	this compromising and thus makes it more systematic. Usually, several
	plans are computed from which the planner selects the most promising
	following a certain procedure. Applying Pareto navigation for this
	selection step simultaneously increases the variety of planning options
	and eases the identification of the most promising plan. Pareto navigation
	is an interactive multi-criteria optimization method that consists
	of the two navigation mechanisms 'selection' and 'restriction'. The
	former allows the formulation of wishes whereas the latter allows
	the exclusion of unwanted plans. They are realized as optimization
	problems on the so-called plan bundle -- a set constructed from pre-computed
	plans. They can be approximately reformulated so that their solution
	time is a small fraction of a second. Thus, the user can be provided
	with immediate feedback regarding his or her decisions. Pareto navigation
	was implemented in the MIRA navigator software and allows real-time
	manipulation of the current plan and the set of considered plans.
	The changes are triggered by simple mouse operations on the so-called
	navigation star and lead to real-time updates of the navigation star
	and the dose visualizations. Since any Pareto-optimal plan in the
	plan bundle can be found with just a few navigation operations the
	MIRA navigator allows a fast and directed plan determination. Besides,
	the concept allows for a refinement of the plan bundle, thus offering
	a middle course between single plan computation and multi-criteria
	optimization. Pareto navigation offers so far unmatched real-time
	interactions, ease of use and plan variety, setting it apart from
	the multi-criteria IMRT planning methods proposed so far.},

	The purpose of the present study was to determine how different the
	dose delivered with such intermissions is from that delivered continuously
	and to estimate dose-modifying factors.Murine EMT6 and SCCVII cells
	in culture were used. First, two doses of 4 Gy were given with an
	interruption of 15 min to 6 h or 1-10 min, or without interruption.
	Next, five fractions of 1.6 Gy were given with interfraction intervals
	of 1 to 5 min each. Doses of 6.5-8 Gy were also given without interruption
	to estimate dose-modifying factors. Cell survival was determined
	by a colony assay. Furthermore, a total dose of 2 Gy was given in
	5 or 10 even fractions at intervals of 1-5 min or 30 s-3 min each,
	respectively, and the results were compared with those obtained after
	1.6-2 Gy delivered continuously by using a cytokinesis-block micronucleus
	assay.In the two-fraction experiments, a significant increase in
	cell survival resulting from recovery from sublethal damage (SLDR)
	was observed when the interruption time was 2 min or longer in EMT6
	cells and 3 min or longer in SCCVII. With a 5-min interval, cell
	survival increased by 13\% in EMT6 and by 18\% in SCCVII. In the
	five-fraction experiments, SLDR was evident when the interfraction
	interval was 2 min or longer in both 8-Gy and 2-Gy dose experiments.
	In the 10-fraction experiment using a dose of 2 Gy, SLDR was evident
	when the interfraction interval was 1 min or longer. In the 5-fraction
	and 10-fraction experiments, the dose-modifying factors were between
	1.08 and 1.16 when the total time for irradiation was between 20
	and 30 min.The effects of stereotactic radiosurgery and IMRT that
	require considerably long beam interruption (e.g., 8 min or longer
	in total) may be less than those of the same dose administered continuously.
	In treatments that take 20 min or longer, dose modification appears
	necessary based on biologically estimated dose-modifying factors.},

	of radiation may be reduced during intermittent exposures owing to
	recovery from sublethal damage in tumor cells. After our previous
	in vitro study suggesting this phenomenon, we investigated the issue
	in murine tumors.We used EMT6 and SCCVII tumors approximately 1 cm
	in diameter growing in the hind legs of syngeneic mice. Three schedules
	of intermittent radiation were investigated. First, 2 fractions of
	10 Gy were given at an interval of 15-360 min to investigate the
	pattern of recovery from sublethal damage. Second, 5 fractions of
	4 Gy were given with interfraction intervals of 2.5-15 min each.
	Third, 10 fractions of 2 Gy were given with interfraction intervals
	of 1-7 min each. Doses of 15-20 Gy were also given without interruption
	to estimate the dose-modifying factors. Tumors were excised 20 h
	later, and tumor cell survival was determined by an in vivo-in vitro
	assay.In the 2-fraction experiment, the increase in cell survival
	with elongation of the interval was much less than that observed
	in our previous in vitro study. In the 5- and 10-fraction experiments,
	no significant increase in cell survival was observed after the intermittent
	exposures. Moreover, cell survival decreased at most points of the
	5-fraction experiments by interruption of radiation in both EMT6
	and SCCVII tumors. In the 10-fraction experiment, cell survival also
	decreased when the interruption was 3 or 7 min in EMT6 tumors.The
	results of the present in vivo studies were different from those
	of our in vitro studies in which cell survival increased significantly
	when a few minutes or longer intervals were posed between fractions.
	This suggests that recovery from sublethal damage in vivo may be
	counterbalanced by other phenomena such as reoxygenation that sensitizes
	tumor cells to subsequent irradiation.},

	cell carcinoma (head and neck), breast and prostate. The linear quadratic
	model of radiation effect, logarithmic tumour growth (coupled with
	delay times where relevant) and the Poisson model for tumour control
	probability (TCP) are used to calculate the change in TCP for delays
	between diagnosis and treatment. Within the limitations of radiobiological
	modelling, these data can be used to tentatively assess the interactions
	between delays, dose fractionation and TCP. The results show that
	delays in the start of radiotherapy treatment do have an adverse
	effect on tumour control for fast-growing tumours. For example, calculations
	predict a reduction in local tumour control of up to 1.5\% per week's
	delay for head and neck cancers treated following surgery. In addition,
	there may be a variety of fractionation regimes that will yield very
	similar clinical results for each tumour type. It is shown theoretically
	that, for the tumour types considered here, it is possible to increase
	the dose per fraction and decrease the number of fractions while
	maintaining or increasing TCP relative to standard 2 Gy fractionation
	regimes, although there may be some advantage to using hyperfractionated
	regimes for head and neck cancers in order to reduce normal tissue
	effects.},

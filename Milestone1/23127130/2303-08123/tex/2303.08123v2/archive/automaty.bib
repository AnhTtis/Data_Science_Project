  abstract = {Objectives: Integration of multiscale experimental cancer biology
	through the development of computer simulation models seems to be
	a necessary step towards the better understanding of cancer and patient-individualized
	treatment optimization. The integration of a four-dimensional patient-specific
	model of in vivo tumor response to radiotherapy developed by our
	group with a model of slowly responding normal tissue based on W.
	Duechting's approach is presented in this paper. The case of glioblastoma
	multiforme and its surrounding neural tissue is addressed as a modeling
	paradigm.Methods: A cubic discretizing mesh is superimposed upon
	the anatomic region of interest as is reconstructed from pertinent
	imaging (e.g. MRI) data. On each geometrical cell of the mesh the
	most crucial biological "laws" e.g. metabolism, cell cycling, tumor
	geometry changes, cell kill following irradiation etc. are applied.
	Slowly responding normal neural tissue is modeled by a functional
	compartment containing indivisible cells and a divisible compartment
	containing glial cells.Results. The model code has been executed
	for a simulated period normally covering the radiotherapy course
	duration and extending a few days after its completion. The following
	schemes have been simulated: standard fractionation, hyperfractionation,
	accelerated fractionation, accelerated hyperfractionation and hypofractionation.
	The predictions are in agreement with the outcome of the RTOG 83-02
	phase I/II trial, the retrospective study conducted by Sugawara et
	al. and the theoretical predictions of Duechting et al.Conclusions.
	The presented model, although oversimplified, may serve as a basis
	for a refined simulation of the biological mechanisms involved in
	tumor and normal tissue response to radiotherapy.},

  abstract = {In this paper we compare two alternative theoretical approaches for
	simulating the growth of cell aggregates in vitro: individual cell
	(agent)-based models and continuum models. We show by a quantitative
	analysis of both a biophysical agent-based and a continuum mechanical
	model that for densely packed aggregates the expansion of the cell
	population is dominated by cell proliferation controlled by mechanical
	stress. The biophysical agent-based model introduced earlier (Drasdo
	and Hoehme in Phys Biol 2:133-147, 2005) approximates each cell as
	an isotropic, homogeneous, elastic, spherical object parameterised
	by measurable biophysical and cell-biological quantities and has
	been shown by comparison to experimental findings to explain the
	growth patterns of dense monolayers and multicellular spheroids.
	Both models exhibit the same growth kinetics, with initial exponential
	growth of the population size and aggregate diameter followed by
	linear growth of the diameter and power-law growth of the cell population
	size. Very sparse monolayers can be explained by a very small or
	absent cell-cell adhesion and large random cell migration. In this
	case the expansion speed is not controlled by mechanical stress but
	by random cell migration and can be modelled by the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piskounov
	(FKPP) reaction-diffusion equation. The growth kinetics differs from
	that of densely packed aggregates in that the initial spread, as
	quantified by the radius of gyration, is diffusive. Since simulations
	of the lattice-free agent-based model in the case of very large random
	migration are too long to be practical, lattice-based cellular automaton
	(CA) models have to be used for a quantitative analysis of sparse
	monolayers. Analysis of these dense monolayers leads to the identification
	of a critical parameter of the CA model so that eventually a hierarchy
	of three model types (a detailed biophysical lattice-free model,
	a rule-based cellular automaton and a continuum approach) emerge
	which yield the same growth pattern for dense and sparse cell aggregates.},

	The basis for all of the models is deriving the continuum PDE using

	we examine the potential role pre-pattern theory (diffusion-driven

	In the model for the immune response to cancer, working from an initial
	"microscale" cell interaction scheme, we derive a system of PDEs
	which are used to predict the capacity of the immune system to eradicate
	cancer (or not). In the final model of cancer invasion, once again
	we initially focus on "microscale" activity of matrix degrading enzymes
	and their binding to cell-surface receptors to derive a PDE model
	of the process of cancer invasion of the local tissue. For each system,

  number = {3},
  abstract = {Tumor cells at low oxygen tension are relatively radioresistant. The
	hypoxic fraction of individual tumors before, during and after radiotherapy
	is likely to have prognostic value but its diagnosis still awaits
	an accurate and acceptable assay. The recent indications that hypoxia
	can also induce the expression of specific genes and promote a more
	aggressive tumor phenotype makes its diagnosis even more important.
	Over 15 years ago, misonidazole, an azomycin-based hypoxic cell radiosensitizer,
	was found to link covalently to cellular molecules at rates inversely
	proportional to intracellular oxygen concentration. The use of bioreducible
	markers to positively label zones of viable hypoxic cells within
	solid tumors and to predict for tumor radioresistance was proposed.
	Several hypoxic markers have now been identified and their selective
	binding within tumors has been measured by both invasive and non-invasive
	assays. Research from our laboratory has emphasized both mechanistic
	and preclinical studies associated with nuclear medicine procedures
	for measuring tumor hypoxia and predicting tumor radioresistance.
	This report updates radiation oncologists about the status of nuclear
	medicine hypoxic marker research and development as of mid-1997.
	While several potential imaging agents have been identified, their
	testing and validation in appropriate human tumors will require focused
	research efforts by individual academic departments and, possibly,
	by clinical trials performed through cooperative groups. Since the
	prediction of hypoxia in individual tumors could strongly impact
	radiotherapy treatment planning, the radiation oncology research
	community is best positioned to execute the validation studies associated
	with these markers.},

	Mesoscopic models (e.g. as based on the Local Interaction Simulation
	Approach [Delsanto, P.P., Mignogna, R., Scalerandi, M., Schechter,
	R., 1998. In: Delsanto, P.P. Saenz, A.W. (Eds.), New Perspectives
	on Problems in Classical and Quantum Physics, vol. 2. Gordon {\&}

	of cell clusters and their interactions, may be used instead of the
	microscopic ones, in order to study the properties of cancer biology
	that strongly depend on the interactions of small groups of cells
	at intermediate spatial and temporal scales. All these approaches
	have been developed independently, which limits their usefulness,
	since they all include relevant features and information that should
	be cross-correlated for a deeper understanding of the mechanisms
	involved.In this contribution we consider multicellular tumor spheroids
	as biological reference systems and propose an intermediate model
	to bridge the gap between a macroscopic formulation of tumor growth
	and a mesoscopic one. Thus we are able to establish, as an important
	result of our formalism, a direct correspondence between parameters
	characterizing processes occurring at different scales. In particular,
	we analyze their dependence on an important limiting factor to tumor
	growth, i.e. the extra-cellular matrix pressure. Since the macro
	and meso-models stem from totally different roots (energy conservation
	and clinical observations vs. cell groups dynamics), their consistency
	may be used to validate both approaches. It may also be interesting
	to note that the proposed formalism fits well into a recently proposed
	conjecture of growth laws universality. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All

  abstract = {To what extent the growth dynamics of tumors is controlled by nutrients,
	biomechanical forces and other factors at different stages and in
	different environments is still largely unknown. Here we present
	a biophysical model to study the spatio-temporal growth dynamics
	of two-dimensional tumor monolayers and three-dimensional tumor spheroids
	as a complementary tool to in vitro experiments. Within our model
	each cell is represented as an individual object and parametrized
	by cell-biophysical and cell-kinetic parameters that can all be experimentally
	determined. Hence our modeling strategy allows us to study which
	mechanisms on the microscopic level of individual cells may affect
	the macroscopic properties of a growing tumor. We find the qualitative
	growth kinetics and patterns at early growth stages to be remarkably
	robust. Quantitative comparisons between computer simulations using
	our model and published experimental observations on monolayer cultures
	suggest a biomechanically-mediated form of growth inhibition during
	the experimentally observed transition from exponential to sub-exponential
	growth at sufficiently large tumor sizes. Our simulations show that
	the same transition during the growth of avascular tumor spheroids

	is the main goal of the system. The document refers to the technology
	of the system and the clinical requirements and the types of medical
	data needed for exploitation in the case of nephroblastoma. The outcome
	of an initial step towards the clinical adaptation and validation
	of the system is presented and discussed. Use of anonymized real

	the SIOP 2001/GPOH nephroblastoma clinical trial constitutes the
	basis of the clinical adaptation and validation process. By using
	real medical data concerning nephroblastoma for a single patient
	in conjunction with plausible values for the model parameters (based
	on available literature) a reasonable prediction of the actual tumour
	volume shrinkage has been made possible. Obviously as more and more
	sets of medical data are exploited the reliability of the model "tuning"
	is expected to increase. The successful performance of the initial
	combined ACGT Oncosimulator platform, although usable Lip to now
	only as a test of principle, has been a particularly encouraging

	model for avascular tumor growth and development that spans three
	distinct scales. At the cellular level, a lattice Monte Carlo model
	describes cellular dynamics (proliferation, adhesion, and viability).
	At the subcellular level, a Boolean network regulates the expression
	of proteins that control the cell cycle. At the extracellular level,
	reaction-diffusion equations describe the chemical dynamics (nutrient,
	waste, growth promoter, and inhibitor concentrations). Data from
	experiments with multicellular spheroids were used to determine the
	parameters of the simulations. Starting with a single tumor cell,
	this model produces an avascular tumor that quantitatively mimics
	experimental measurements in multicellular spheroids. Based on the
	simulations, we predict: 1), the microenvironmental conditions required
	for tumor cell survival; and 2), growth promoters and inhibitors
	have diffusion coefficients in the range between 10(-6) and 10(-7)
	cm(2)/ h, corresponding to molecules of size 80-90 kDa. Using the
	same parameters, the model also accurately predicts spheroid growth
	curves under different external nutrient supply conditions.},

	tumours was studied using the 125IUdR loss technique. Administration
	of 125IUdR preceded localized tumour irradiation by 2 days. Loss
	of tumour radioactivity was measured for 6--8 days after irradiation.
	the blood flow to some tumours was occluded during, and for 30 min
	following, injection of the label to measure the amount of radioactivity
	entering the tumour as a result of reutilization of label from the
	gut epithelia and influx of labelled host cells. Irradiation did
	not significantly alter the amount of radioactivity entering these
	clamped tumours during the 8--10 days after injection of 125IUdR.
	This permitted comparison of irradiated and control groups based
	on the loss of radioactivity from the non-occluded tumours. Irradiation
	of RIF-1, EMT6, KHJJ or B16 tumours with doses of 600, 1400, 2400
	or 4400 rads produced no significant increase in the rate of loss
	of tumour radioactivity. This suggested that, in the population of
	labelled cells, cell lysis following irradiation proceeded slowly.
	In contrast, KHT tumours showed a significant increase in loss rate
	following each radiation dose, although the increase was dose-independent.
	In all tumour systems, the constant rate of cell loss after radiation
	appeared to coincide with published reports of tumour growth responses
	after irradiation. the present data suggest that the manner of expression
	of radiation-induced cell killing results from the cellular proliferative
	status, i.e. whether a cell is cycling or non-cycling.},

	The techniques of two-step acridine orange staining followed by flow

	that one of these subpopulations predominantly consisted of proliferating
	G1 cells, while the other contained about four times more quiescent
	G0/G1 cells. These two subpopulations had similar median cell volumes
	and DNA contents, but the cell volume distributions were different.
	The clonogenicity was greater in the 'proliferating' subpopulation
	than the 'quiescent' subpopulation. When cell number seeded was corrected
	for viability, regrowth studies showed that there was a longer time
	(25 h) for the 'quiescent' subpopulation than the 'proliferating'
	subpopulation (10 h) before any increase in cell number was observed.
	In addition, relative to the 'proliferating' cells, the 'quiescent'
	cells were more sensitive when exposed to 137Cs gamma-ray radiation.
	The D0's were similar between the two subpopulations (D0 = 1.6 Gy
	and 1.8 Gy for the 'proliferating' G1 and 'quiescent' G0/G1 subpopulation,
	respectively), but the width of the shoulder of the radiation survival

	Compared to spheroids grown in normal glucose concentration (5.5

	no difference in initial volume doubling time, clonogenicity, number

	nutrient concentrations. Proliferation of viable cells is contact-inhibited
	if the total cellular density locally exceeds volume carrying capacity.
	The model is discussed under the assumption of spherical symmetry.
	Unknown model parameters are determined by simultaneously fitting
	the cell number to several experimental growth curves for different

	with an analogous off-lattice agent-based model for tumour growth.
	It turns out that the numerically more efficient PDE model suffices

  abstract = {The growth kinetics of a cancer cell population as a function of the
	total number of cells and the proportion of proliferating and resting
	cells at the beginning of the growth has been analysed by a mathematical
	model. The model takes into account the processes of cell division,
	death and transition from proliferation to rest and backwards. It
	is shown that a single cell population growing under the same environmental
	conditions has an extremely broad spectrum of growth patterns. The
	whole multiplicity of possible growth patterns has been determined
	by the inherent cellular growth characteristics of the population,
	while the growth pattern actually realized of the variety of growth
	curves depends on the total number of cells and the proportion of
	proliferating and resting cells at the initial moment of growth.
	The model is shown to provide a good prediction of experimentally
	measured kinetics of regrowth of tumour cells subcultured after various
	times of the growth in unfed cultures, and the kinetics of tumour
	cell growth after severe hypoxia. The role of cell transitions between
	proliferating and resting stages in the problem of growth control
	is discussed.},

  abstract = {Tumours behave as complex, self-organizing, opportunistic dynamic
	systems. In an attempt to better understand and describe the highly
	complicated tumour behaviour, a novel four-dimensional simulation
	model of in vivo tumour growth and response to radiotherapy has been
	developed. This paper presents the latest improvements to the model
	as well as a parametric validation of it. Improvements include an
	advanced algorithm leading to conformal tumour shrinkage, a quantitative
	consideration of the influence of oxygenation on radiosensitivity
	and a more realistic, imaging based description of the neovasculature
	distribution. The tumours selected for the validation of the model
	are a wild type and a mutated p53 gene glioblastomas multiforme.
	According to the model predictions, a whole tumour with larger cell
	cycle duration tends to repopulate more slowly. A lower oxygen enhancement
	ratio value leads to a more radiosensitive whole tumour. Higher clonogenic
	cell density (CCD) produces a higher number of proliferating tumour
	cells and, therefore, a more difficult tumour to treat. Simulation
	predictions agree at least semi-quantitatively with clinical experience,
	and particularly with the outcome of the Radiation Therapy Oncology
	Group (RTOG) Study 83-02. It is stressed that the model allows a
	quantitative study of the interrelationship between the competing
	influences in a complex, dynamic tumour environment. Therefore, the
	model can already be useful as an educational tool with which to
	study, understand and demonstrate the role of various parameters
	in tumour growth and response to irradiation. A long term quantitative
	clinical adaptation and validation of the model aiming at its integration
	into the treatment planning procedure is in progress.},

	The main processes taken into account by the model are the transitions

	and the cell survival probabilities following irradiation. Specific

	High-performance computing systems in conjunction with Web technologies
	have coped with the particularly high computer memory and processing
	demands. A visualization system based on the MATLAB software package
	and the virtual-reality modeling language has been employed. Its
	utilization has led to a spectacular representation of both the external

	model has been applied to the special case of small cell lung carcinoma

	in essential nutrients and contain a large number of quiescent and
	dying cells. Chemotherapeutic compounds are not effective against
	quiescent cells and therefore have reduced efficacy against tumors
	with extensive quiescence. We have formulated a mathematical model
	that predicts the extent and location of quiescence in multicellular
	spheroids. Multicellular spheroids are in vitro models of in vivo
	tumor growth that have proven to be useful experimental systems for
	studying radiation therapy, drug penetration, and novel chemotherapeutic
	strategies. Our model incorporates a realistic description of primary
	energy metabolism within reaction-diffusion equations to predict
	local glucose, oxygen, and lactate concentrations and an overall
	spheroid growth rate. The model development is based on the assumption
	that local cellular growth and death rates are determined by local
	ATP production generated by intracellular energy metabolism. Dynamic
	simulation and parametric sensitivity studies are used to evaluate
	model behavior, including the spatial distribution of proliferating,
	quiescent, and dead cells for different cellular characteristics.
	Using this model we have determined the critical cell survival parameters
	that have the greatest impact on overall spheroid physiology, and
	we have found that oxygen transport has a greater effect than glucose
	transport on the distribution of quiescent cells. By predicting the
	extent of quiescence based on individual cellular characteristic
	alone this model has the potential to predict therapeutic efficiency
	and can be used to design effective chemotherapeutic strategies.

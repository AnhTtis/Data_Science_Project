abstract = {Tumour hypoxia plays a pivotal role in cancer therapy for most therapeutic approaches from radiotherapy to immunotherapy. The detailed and accurate knowledge of the oxygen distribution in a tumour is necessary in order to determine the right treatment strategy. Still, due to the limited spatial and temporal resolution of imaging methods as well as lacking fundamental understanding of internal oxygenation dynamics in tumours, the precise oxygen distribution map is rarely available for treatment planing. We employ an agent-based in silico tumour spheroid model in order to study the complex, localized and fast oxygen dynamics in tumour micro-regions which are induced by radiotherapy. A lattice-free, 3D, agent-based approach for cell representation is coupled with a high-resolution diffusion solver that includes a tissue density-dependent diffusion coefficient. This allows us to assess the space- and time-resolved reoxygenation response of a small subvolume of tumour tissue in response to radiotherapy. In response to irradiation the tumour nodule exhibits characteristic reoxygenation and re-depletion dynamics which we resolve with high spatio-temporal resolution. The reoxygenation follows specific timings, which should be respected in treatment in order to maximise the use of the oxygen enhancement effects. Oxygen dynamics within the tumour create windows of opportunity for the use of adjuvant chemotherapeutica and hypoxia-activated drugs. Overall, we show that by using modelling it is possible to follow the oxygenation dynamics beyond common resolution limits and predict beneficial strategies for therapy and in vitro verification. Models of cell cycle and oxygen dynamics in tumours should in the future be combined with imaging techniques, to allow for a systematic experimental study of possible improved schedules and to ultimately extend the reach of oxygenation monitoring available in clinical treatment.},

@article{Montaseri2020,
abstract = {Recent evidence indicates the ability of radiotherapy to induce local and systemic tumor-specific immune responses as a result of immunogenic cell death. However, fractionation regimes routinely used in clinical practice typically ignore the synergy between radiation and the immune system, and instead attempt to completely eradicate tumors by the direct lethal effect of radiation on cancer cells. This paradigm is expected to change in the near future due to the potential benefits of considering radiation-induced antitumor immunity during treatment planning. Towards this goal, we propose a minimal modeling framework based on key aspects of the tumor-immune system interplay to simulate the effects of radiation on tumors and the immunological consequences of radiotherapy. The impacts of tumor-associated vasculature and intratumoral oxygen-mediated heterogeneity on treatment outcomes are ininvestigated. The model provides estimates of the minimum radiation doses required for tumor eradication given a certain number of treatment fractions. Moreover, estimates of treatment duration for disease control given predetermined fractional radiation doses can be also obtained. Although theoretical in nature, this study motivates the development and establishment of immune-based decision-support tools in radiotherapy planning.},

@article{Alfonso2020,
abstract = {Emerging evidence demonstrates that radiotherapy induces immunogenic death on tumor cells that emit immunostimulating signals resulting in tumor-specific immune responses. However, the impact of tumor features and microenvironmental factors on the efficacy of radiation-induced immunity remains to be elucidated. Herein, we use a calibrated model of tumor-effector cell interactions to investigate the potential benefits and immunological consequences of radiotherapy. Simulations analysis suggests that radiotherapy success depends on the functional tumor vascularity extent and reveals that the pre-treatment tumor size is not a consistent determinant of treatment outcomes. The one-size-fits-all approach of conventionally fractionated radiotherapy is predicted to result in some overtreated patients. In addition, model simulations also suggest that an arbitrary increase in treatment duration does not necessarily result in better tumor control. This study highlights the potential benefits of tumor-immune ecosystem profiling during treatment planning to better harness the immunogenic potential of radiotherapy.},

@article{Wang2018,
abstract = {Since the approval of anti-CTLA4 therapy (ipilimumab) for late-stage melanoma in 2011, the development of anticancer immunotherapy agents has thrived. The success of many immune-checkpoint inhibitors has drastically changed the landscape of cancer treatment. For some types of cancer, monotherapy for targeting immune checkpoint pathways has proven more effective than traditional therapies, and combining immunotherapy with current treatment strategies may yield even better outcomes. Numerous preclinical studies have suggested that combining immunotherapy with radiotherapy could be a promising strategy for synergistic enhancement of treatment efficacy. Radiation delivered to the tumor site affects both tumor cells and surrounding stromal cells. Radiation-induced cancer cell damage exposes tumor-specific antigens that make them visible to immune surveillance and promotes the priming and activation of cytotoxic T cells. Radiation-induced modulation of the tumor microenvironment may also facilitate the recruitment and infiltration of immune cells. This unique relationship is the rationale for combining radiation with immune checkpoint blockade. Enhanced tumor recognition and immune cell targeting with checkpoint blockade may unleash the immune system to eliminate the cancer cells. However, challenges remain to be addressed to maximize the efficacy of this promising combination. Here we summarize the mechanisms of radiation and immune system interaction, and we discuss current challenges in radiation and immune checkpoint blockade therapy and possible future approaches to boost this combination.},

abstract = {As we mark 150 years since the birth of Marie Curie, we reflect on the global advances made in radiation oncology and the current status of radiation therapy (RT) research. Large-scale international RT clinical trials have been fundamental in driving evidence-based change and have served to improve cancer management and to reduce side effects. Radiation therapy trials have also improved practice by increasing quality assurance and consistency in treatment protocols across multiple centres. This review summarises some of the key RT practice-changing clinical trials over the last two decades, in four common cancer sites for which RT is a crucial component of curative treatment: breast, lung, urological and lower gastro-intestinal cancer. We highlight the global inequality in access to RT, and the work of international organisations, such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the European SocieTy for Radiotherapy and Oncology (ESTRO), and the United Kingdom National Cancer Research Institute Clinical and Translational Radiotherapy Research Working Group (CTRad), that aim to improve access to RT and facilitate radiation research. We discuss some emerging RT technologies including proton beam therapy and magnetic resonance linear accelerators and predict likely future directions in clinical RT research.},

@article{Bentzen2008,
abstract = {Background: The international standard radiotherapy schedule for early breast cancer delivers 50 Gy in 25 fractions of 2{\textperiodcentered}0 Gy over 5 weeks, but there is a long history of non-standard regimens delivering a lower total dose using fewer, larger fractions (hypofractionation). We aimed to test the benefits of radiotherapy schedules using fraction sizes larger than 2{\textperiodcentered}0 Gy in terms of local-regional tumour control, normal tissue responses, quality of life, and economic consequences in women prescribed post-operative radiotherapy. Methods: Between 1999 and 2001, 2215 women with early breast cancer (pT1-3a pN0-1 M0) at 23 centres in the UK were randomly assigned after primary surgery to receive 50 Gy in 25 fractions of 2{\textperiodcentered}0 Gy over 5 weeks or 40 Gy in 15 fractions of 2{\textperiodcentered}67 Gy over 3 weeks. Women were eligible for the trial if they were aged over 18 years, did not have an immediate reconstruction, and were available for follow-up. Randomisation method was computer generated and was not blinded. The protocol-specified principal endpoints were local-regional tumour relapse, defined as reappearance of cancer at irradiated sites, late normal tissue effects, and quality of life. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN59368779. Findings: 1105 women were assigned to the 50 Gy group and 1110 to the 40 Gy group. After a median follow up of 6{\textperiodcentered}0 years (IQR 5{\textperiodcentered}0-6{\textperiodcentered}2) the rate of local-regional tumour relapse at 5 years was 2{\textperiodcentered}2\% (95\% CI 1{\textperiodcentered}3-3{\textperiodcentered}1) in the 40 Gy group and 3{\textperiodcentered}3\% (95\% CI 2{\textperiodcentered}2 to 4{\textperiodcentered}5) in the 50 Gy group, representing an absolute difference of -0{\textperiodcentered}7\% (95\% CI -1{\textperiodcentered}7\% to 0{\textperiodcentered}9\%)-ie, the absolute difference in local-regional relapse could be up to 1{\textperiodcentered}7\% better and at most 1\% worse after 40 Gy than after 50 Gy. Photographic and patient self-assessments indicated lower rates of late adverse effects after 40 Gy than after 50 Gy. Interpretation: A radiation schedule delivering 40 Gy in 15 fractions seems to offer rates of local-regional tumour relapse and late adverse effects at least as favourable as the standard schedule of 50 Gy in 25 fractions. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Background: Breast irradiation after lumpectomy is an integral component of breast-conserving therapy that reduces the local recurrence of breast cancer. Because an optimal fractionation schedule (radiation dose given in a specified number of fractions or treatment sessions over a defined time) for breast irradiation has not been uniformly accepted, we examined whether a 22-day fractionation schedule was as effective as the more traditional 35-day schedule in reducing recurrence. Methods: Women with invasive breast cancer who were treated by lumpectomy and had pathologically clear resection margins and negative axillary lymph nodes were randomly assigned to receive whole breast irradiation of 42.5 Gy in 16 fractions over 22 days (short arm) or whole breast irradiation of 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 35 days (long arm). The primary outcome was local recurrence of invasive breast cancer in the treated breast. Secondary outcomes included cosmetic outcome, assessed with the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Cosmetic Rating System. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: From April 1993 through September 1996, 1234 women were randomly assigned to treatment, 622 to the short arm and 612 to the long arm. Median follow-up was 69 months. Five-year local recurrence-free survival was 97.2\% in the short arm and 96.8\% in the long arm (absolute difference = 0.4\%, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = -1.5\% to 2.4\%). No difference in disease-free or overall survival rates was detected between study arms. The percentage of patients with an excellent or good global cosmetic outcome at 3 years was 76.8\% in the short arm and 77.0\% in the long arm; the corresponding data at 5 years were 76.8\% and 77.4\%, respectively (absolute difference = -0.6\%, 95\% CI = -6.5\% to 5.5\%). Conclusion: The more convenient 22-day fractionation schedule appears to be an acceptable alternative to the 35-day schedule.},

METHODS We conducted a study to determine whether a hypofractionated 3-week schedule of whole-breast irradiation is as effective as a 5-week schedule. Women with invasive breast cancer who had undergone breast-conserving surgery and in whom resection margins were clear and axillary lymph nodes were negative were randomly assigned to receive whole-breast irradiation either at a standard dose of 50.0 Gy in 25 fractions over a period of 35 days (the control group) or at a dose of 42.5 Gy in 16 fractions over a period of 22 days (the hypofractionated-radiation group). RESULTS The risk of local recurrence at 10 years was 6.7\% among the 612 women assigned to standard irradiation as compared with 6.2\% among the 622 women assigned to the hypofractionated regimen (absolute difference, 0.5 percentage points; 95\% confidence interval [CI], -2.5 to 3.5). At 10 years, 71.3\% of women in the control group as compared with 69.8\% of the women in the hypofractionated-radiation group had a good or excellent cosmetic outcome (absolute difference, 1.5 percentage points; 95\% CI, -6.9 to 9.8).

abstract = {Background: 5-year results of the UK Standardisation of Breast Radiotherapy (START) trials suggested that lower total doses of radiotherapy delivered in fewer, larger doses (fractions) are at least as safe and effective as the historical standard regimen (50 Gy in 25 fractions) for women after primary surgery for early breast cancer. In this prespecified analysis, we report the 10-year follow-up of the START trials testing 13 fraction and 15 fraction regimens. Methods: From 1999 to 2002, women with completely excised invasive breast cancer (pT1-3a, pN0-1, M0) were enrolled from 35 UK radiotherapy centres. Patients were randomly assigned to a treatment regimen after primary surgery followed by chemotherapy and endocrine treatment (where prescribed). Randomisation was computer-generated and stratified by centre, type of primary surgery (breast-conservation surgery or mastectomy), and tumour bed boost radiotherapy. In START-A, a regimen of 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks was compared with 41{\textperiodcentered}6 Gy or 39 Gy in 13 fractions over 5 weeks. In START-B, a regimen of 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks was compared with 40 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks. Eligibility criteria included age older than 18 years and no immediate surgical reconstruction. Primary endpoints were local-regional tumour relapse and late normal tissue effects. Analysis was by intention to treat. Follow-up data are still being collected. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN59368779. Findings: START-A enrolled 2236 women. Median follow-up was 9{\textperiodcentered}3 years (IQR 8{\textperiodcentered}0-10{\textperiodcentered}0), after which 139 local-regional relapses had occurred. 10-year rates of local-regional relapse did not differ significantly between the 41{\textperiodcentered}6 Gy and 50 Gy regimen groups (6{\textperiodcentered}3\%, 95\% CI 4{\textperiodcentered}7-8{\textperiodcentered}5 vs 7{\textperiodcentered}4\%, 5{\textperiodcentered}5-10{\textperiodcentered}0; hazard ratio [HR] 0{\textperiodcentered}91, 95\% CI 0{\textperiodcentered}59-1{\textperiodcentered}38; p=0{\textperiodcentered}65) or the 39 Gy (8{\textperiodcentered}8\%, 95\% CI 6{\textperiodcentered}7-11{\textperiodcentered}4) and 50 Gy regimen groups (HR 1{\textperiodcentered}18, 95\% CI 0{\textperiodcentered}79-1{\textperiodcentered}76; p=0{\textperiodcentered}41). In START-A, moderate or marked breast induration, telangiectasia, and breast oedema were significantly less common normal tissue effects in the 39 Gy group than in the 50 Gy group. Normal tissue effects did not differ significantly between 41{\textperiodcentered}6 Gy and 50 Gy groups. START-B enrolled 2215 women. Median follow-up was 9{\textperiodcentered}9 years (IQR 7{\textperiodcentered}5-10{\textperiodcentered}1), after which 95 local-regional relapses had occurred. The proportion of patients with local-regional relapse at 10 years did not differ significantly between the 40 Gy group (4{\textperiodcentered}3\%, 95\% CI 3{\textperiodcentered}2-5{\textperiodcentered}9) and the 50 Gy group (5{\textperiodcentered}5\%, 95\% CI 4{\textperiodcentered}2-7{\textperiodcentered}2; HR 0{\textperiodcentered}77, 95\% CI 0{\textperiodcentered}51-1{\textperiodcentered}16; p=0{\textperiodcentered}21). In START-B, breast shrinkage, telangiectasia, and breast oedema were significantly less common normal tissue effects in the 40 Gy group than in the 50 Gy group. Interpretation: Long-term follow-up confirms that appropriately dosed hypofractionated radiotherapy is safe and effective for patients with early breast cancer. The results support the continued use of 40 Gy in 15 fractions, which has already been adopted by most UK centres as the standard of care for women requiring adjuvant radiotherapy for invasive early breast cancer.

abstract = {Several combinatorial methods have been developed to create focused or diverse chemical libraries with a wide range of linear or macrocyclic chemical molecules: peptides, non-peptide oligomers, peptidomimetics, small-molecules, and natural product-like organic molecules. Each combinatorial approach has its own unique high-throughput screening and encoding strategy. In this article, we provide a brief overview of combinatorial chemistry in drug discovery with emphasis on recently developed new technologies for design, synthesis, screening and decoding of combinatorial library. Examples of successful application of combinatorial chemistry in hit discovery and lead optimization are given. The limitations and strengths of combinatorial chemistry are also briefly discussed. We are now in a better position to truly leverage the power of combinatorial technologies for the discovery and development of next-generation drugs.},

abstract = {There has been an exponential growth in the performance and output of sequencing technologies (omics data) with full genome sequencing now producing gigabases of reads on a daily basis. These data may hold the promise of personalized medicine, leading to routinely available sequencing tests that can guide patient treatment decisions. In the era of high-throughput sequencing (HTS), computational considerations, data governance and clinical translation are the greatest rate-limiting steps. To ensure that the analysis, management and interpretation of such extensive omics data is exploited to its full potential, key factors, including sample sourcing, technology selection and computational expertise and resources, need to be considered, leading to an integrated set of high-performance tools and systems. This article provides an up-to-date overview of the evolution of HTS and the accompanying tools, infrastructure and data management approaches that are emerging in this space, which, if used within in a multidisciplinary context, may ultimately facilitate the development of personalized medicine.},

	optimization is a problem in IMRT. In a previous publication we showed

	Recently the so-called direct aperture optimization method has been

	present paper is to present in detail the integration of the inverse
	kernel method into direct aperture optimization. It can be shown
	that this integration leads to a system with high performance with
	regard to time, while Monte Carlo precision is maintained. The integrated
	simulated annealing optimization algorithm allows easy adaptation
	to any multi-leaf collimator and it is open to any complex objective
	function. Investigations of simulated annealing control parameters
	are performed to improve the performance. The system denoted by direct
	Monte Carlo optimization (DMCO) is demonstrated on the Carpet phantom
	and a clinical prostate case as well. Results are compared to inverse
	kernel optimizations, showing a remarkable time reduction and simultaneously
	an improvement in plan quality for the Carpet phantom.},

	designed to test if low-LET radiation repair processes could be quantified
	in terms of second-order kinetics. The newer version allows calculation
	of both the repair rate of the proportion of DNA damages that repair
	according to second-order kinetics and the proportion of DNA damages
	that do not repair.The original and present models are intercompared
	in terms of their goodness-of-fit to a number of data sets obtained
	from different ion beams. The analysis demonstrates that the present
	model provides a better fit to the data in all cases studied.The
	proportions of unrepairable damage created by radiations of different
	LET predicted by the new model correspond well with previous studies
	on the increased effectiveness of high-LET radiations in inducing
	reproductive cell death. The results show that the original model
	may underestimate the proportion of unrepaired damage at any given
	time after its creation as well as failing to predict very slow or
	unrepairable damage components, which may result from high-LET irradiation.It
	is suggested that the second-order model presented here offers a
	more realistic view of the patterns of repair in cell lines or tissues
	exposed to high-LET radiation.},

	In order to use MR imaging alone for treatment planning the effect

	with larger lateral dimensions (>36 cm), the differences in patient
	external contours between distortion-free CT images and GDC-corrected
	MR images were 1-2 cm because of the combination of greater gradient
	distortion and loss of field homogeneity away from the isocentre
	and the uncertainties in patient setup during CT and MRI scans. The
	measured distortion maps were used to perform point-by-point corrections
	for patients with large dimensions inside the effective FOV. Using
	the point-by-point method, the geometrical distortion after the GDC

	were treated to 3000 rads (cGy) in 3 weeks but others received 4000
	in 5 or 6000 in 6 weeks. When I asked why, there were no convincing
	answers given, except 'this is what we usually do'. It wasn't until
	I went to a course on 'Radiobiology for Radiotherapy' in Cambridge
	that I learnt about the basic theories of Douglas Lea and the very
	considerable history of research into radiobiology and clinical radiotherapy.
	And there were still some questions outstanding, such as the relative
	importance of intracellular repair between 'daily' fractions, whether
	a 2 day gap each week was a good or a bad idea, and the role of proliferation,
	if any, during irradiation. I thought that a few simple animal experiments
	might help to give answers! That led me to a continuing interest
	in these questions and answers, which has taken me more than 50 years
	to pursue. This is the very personal story of what I saw happening
	in the subject, decade by decade. I was happy to experience all this
	together with scientists in many other countries, and our own, along
	the way.},

	in high-dose-per-fraction radiotherapy in comparison with the linear-quadratic
	(LQ) model. Cell survival data of V79 and EMT6 single cells receiving
	single doses of 2-12 Gy or 2 or 3 fractions of 4 or 5 Gy each, and
	that of V79 spheroids receiving single doses of 5-26 Gy or 2-5 fractions
	of 5-12 Gy, were analyzed. Single and fractionated doses to actually
	reduce cell survival to the same level were determined by a colony
	assay. Single doses used in the experiments and surviving fractions
	at the doses were substituted into equations of the RCR, MT and LQ
	models in the calculation software Mathematica, and each parameter
	coefficient was computed. Thereafter, using the coefficients and
	the three models, equivalent single doses for the hypofractionated
	doses were calculated. They were then compared with actually-determined
	equivalent single doses for the hypofractionated doses. The equivalent
	single doses calculated using the RCR, MT and LQ models tended to
	be lower than the actually determined equivalent single doses. The
	LQ model seemed to fit relatively well at doses of 5 Gy or less.
	At 6 Gy or higher doses, the RCR and MT models seemed to be more
	reliable than the LQ model. In hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy,
	the LQ model should not be used, and conversion models incorporating
	the concept of the RCR or MT models, such as the generalized linear-quadratic
	models, appear to be more suitable.},

  abstract = {A method named approaching genetic algorithm (AGA) is introduced to
	automatically select the beam angles for intensity-modulated radiotherapy
	(IMRT) planning. In AGA, the best individual of the current population
	is found at first, and the rest of the normal individuals approach
	the current best one according to some specially designed rules.
	In the course of approaching, some better individuals may be obtained.
	Then, the current best individual is updated to try to approach the
	real best one. The approaching and updating operations of AGA replace
	the selection, crossover and mutation operations of the genetic algorithm
	(GA) completely. Using the specially designed updating strategies,
	AGA can recover the varieties of the population to a certain extent
	and retain the powerful ability of evolution, compared to GA. The
	beam angles are selected using AGA, followed by a beam intensity
	map optimization using conjugate gradient (CG). A simulated case
	and a clinical case with nasopharynx cancer are employed to demonstrate
	the feasibility of AGA. For the case investigated, AGA was feasible
	for the beam angle optimization (BAO) problem in IMRT planning and
	converged faster than GA.},

  abstract = {We present a novel framework that enables very large scale intensity-modulated
	radiation therapy (IMRT) planning in limited computation resources
	with improvements in cost, plan quality and planning throughput.
	Current IMRT optimization uses a voxel-based beamlet superposition
	(VBS) framework that requires pre-calculation and storage of a large
	amount of beamlet data, resulting in large temporal and spatial complexity.
	We developed a non-voxel-based broad-beam (NVBB) framework for IMRT
	capable of direct treatment parameter optimization (DTPO). In this
	framework, both objective function and derivative are evaluated based
	on the continuous viewpoint, abandoning 'voxel' and 'beamlet' representations.
	Thus pre-calculation and storage of beamlets are no longer needed.
	The NVBB framework has linear complexities (O(N(3))) in both space
	and time. The low memory, full computation and data parallelization
	nature of the framework render its efficient implementation on the
	graphic processing unit (GPU). We implemented the NVBB framework
	and incorporated it with the TomoTherapy treatment planning system
	(TPS). The new TPS runs on a single workstation with one GPU card
	(NVBB-GPU). Extensive verification/validation tests were performed
	in house and via third parties. Benchmarks on dose accuracy, plan
	quality and throughput were compared with the commercial TomoTherapy
	TPS that is based on the VBS framework and uses a computer cluster
	with 14 nodes (VBS-cluster). For all tests, the dose accuracy of
	these two TPSs is comparable (within 1\%). Plan qualities were comparable
	with no clinically significant difference for most cases except that
	superior target uniformity was seen in the NVBB-GPU for some cases.
	However, the planning time using the NVBB-GPU was reduced many folds
	over the VBS-cluster. In conclusion, we developed a novel NVBB framework
	for IMRT optimization. The continuous viewpoint and DTPO nature of
	the algorithm eliminate the need for beamlets and lead to better
	plan quality. The computation parallelization on a GPU instead of
	a computer cluster significantly reduces hardware and service costs.
	Compared with using the current VBS framework on a computer cluster,
	the planning time is significantly reduced using the NVBB framework
	on a single workstation with a GPU card.},

  abstract = {Inherently, IMRT treatment planning involves compromising between
	different planning goals. Multi-criteria IMRT planning directly addresses
	this compromising and thus makes it more systematic. Usually, several
	plans are computed from which the planner selects the most promising
	following a certain procedure. Applying Pareto navigation for this
	selection step simultaneously increases the variety of planning options
	and eases the identification of the most promising plan. Pareto navigation
	is an interactive multi-criteria optimization method that consists
	of the two navigation mechanisms 'selection' and 'restriction'. The
	former allows the formulation of wishes whereas the latter allows
	the exclusion of unwanted plans. They are realized as optimization
	problems on the so-called plan bundle -- a set constructed from pre-computed
	plans. They can be approximately reformulated so that their solution
	time is a small fraction of a second. Thus, the user can be provided
	with immediate feedback regarding his or her decisions. Pareto navigation
	was implemented in the MIRA navigator software and allows real-time
	manipulation of the current plan and the set of considered plans.
	The changes are triggered by simple mouse operations on the so-called
	navigation star and lead to real-time updates of the navigation star
	and the dose visualizations. Since any Pareto-optimal plan in the
	plan bundle can be found with just a few navigation operations the
	MIRA navigator allows a fast and directed plan determination. Besides,
	the concept allows for a refinement of the plan bundle, thus offering
	a middle course between single plan computation and multi-criteria
	optimization. Pareto navigation offers so far unmatched real-time
	interactions, ease of use and plan variety, setting it apart from
	the multi-criteria IMRT planning methods proposed so far.},

  abstract = {In stereotactic irradiation using a linear accelerator and intensity-modulated
	radiation therapy (IMRT), radiation is administered intermittently,
	and 30 min or longer is often required in one treatment session.
	The purpose of the present study was to determine how different the
	dose delivered with such intermissions is from that delivered continuously
	and to estimate dose-modifying factors.Murine EMT6 and SCCVII cells
	in culture were used. First, two doses of 4 Gy were given with an
	interruption of 15 min to 6 h or 1-10 min, or without interruption.
	Next, five fractions of 1.6 Gy were given with interfraction intervals
	of 1 to 5 min each. Doses of 6.5-8 Gy were also given without interruption
	to estimate dose-modifying factors. Cell survival was determined
	by a colony assay. Furthermore, a total dose of 2 Gy was given in
	5 or 10 even fractions at intervals of 1-5 min or 30 s-3 min each,
	respectively, and the results were compared with those obtained after
	1.6-2 Gy delivered continuously by using a cytokinesis-block micronucleus
	assay.In the two-fraction experiments, a significant increase in
	cell survival resulting from recovery from sublethal damage (SLDR)
	was observed when the interruption time was 2 min or longer in EMT6
	cells and 3 min or longer in SCCVII. With a 5-min interval, cell
	survival increased by 13\% in EMT6 and by 18\% in SCCVII. In the
	five-fraction experiments, SLDR was evident when the interfraction
	interval was 2 min or longer in both 8-Gy and 2-Gy dose experiments.
	In the 10-fraction experiment using a dose of 2 Gy, SLDR was evident
	when the interfraction interval was 1 min or longer. In the 5-fraction
	and 10-fraction experiments, the dose-modifying factors were between
	1.08 and 1.16 when the total time for irradiation was between 20
	and 30 min.The effects of stereotactic radiosurgery and IMRT that
	require considerably long beam interruption (e.g., 8 min or longer
	in total) may be less than those of the same dose administered continuously.
	In treatments that take 20 min or longer, dose modification appears
	necessary based on biologically estimated dose-modifying factors.},

  abstract = {In stereotactic irradiation using a linear accelerator, the effect
	of radiation may be reduced during intermittent exposures owing to
	recovery from sublethal damage in tumor cells. After our previous
	in vitro study suggesting this phenomenon, we investigated the issue
	in murine tumors.We used EMT6 and SCCVII tumors approximately 1 cm
	in diameter growing in the hind legs of syngeneic mice. Three schedules
	of intermittent radiation were investigated. First, 2 fractions of
	10 Gy were given at an interval of 15-360 min to investigate the
	pattern of recovery from sublethal damage. Second, 5 fractions of
	4 Gy were given with interfraction intervals of 2.5-15 min each.
	Third, 10 fractions of 2 Gy were given with interfraction intervals
	of 1-7 min each. Doses of 15-20 Gy were also given without interruption
	to estimate the dose-modifying factors. Tumors were excised 20 h
	later, and tumor cell survival was determined by an in vivo-in vitro
	assay.In the 2-fraction experiment, the increase in cell survival
	with elongation of the interval was much less than that observed
	in our previous in vitro study. In the 5- and 10-fraction experiments,
	no significant increase in cell survival was observed after the intermittent
	exposures. Moreover, cell survival decreased at most points of the
	5-fraction experiments by interruption of radiation in both EMT6
	and SCCVII tumors. In the 10-fraction experiment, cell survival also
	decreased when the interruption was 3 or 7 min in EMT6 tumors.The
	results of the present in vivo studies were different from those
	of our in vitro studies in which cell survival increased significantly
	when a few minutes or longer intervals were posed between fractions.
	This suggests that recovery from sublethal damage in vivo may be
	counterbalanced by other phenomena such as reoxygenation that sensitizes
	tumor cells to subsequent irradiation.},

  abstract = {There is often a considerable delay from initial tumour diagnosis
	to the start of radiotherapy treatment. This paper extends the calculations
	of a previous paper on the effects of delays before the initiation
	of radiotherapy treatment to include results from a variety of practical
	fractionation regimes for three different types of tumour: squamous
	cell carcinoma (head and neck), breast and prostate. The linear quadratic
	model of radiation effect, logarithmic tumour growth (coupled with
	delay times where relevant) and the Poisson model for tumour control
	probability (TCP) are used to calculate the change in TCP for delays
	between diagnosis and treatment. Within the limitations of radiobiological
	modelling, these data can be used to tentatively assess the interactions
	between delays, dose fractionation and TCP. The results show that
	delays in the start of radiotherapy treatment do have an adverse
	effect on tumour control for fast-growing tumours. For example, calculations
	predict a reduction in local tumour control of up to 1.5\% per week's
	delay for head and neck cancers treated following surgery. In addition,
	there may be a variety of fractionation regimes that will yield very
	similar clinical results for each tumour type. It is shown theoretically
	that, for the tumour types considered here, it is possible to increase
	the dose per fraction and decrease the number of fractions while
	maintaining or increasing TCP relative to standard 2 Gy fractionation
	regimes, although there may be some advantage to using hyperfractionated
	regimes for head and neck cancers in order to reduce normal tissue
	effects.},

	through the development of computer simulation models seems to be
	a necessary step towards the better understanding of cancer and patient-individualized
	treatment optimization. The integration of a four-dimensional patient-specific
	model of in vivo tumor response to radiotherapy developed by our
	group with a model of slowly responding normal tissue based on W.
	Duechting's approach is presented in this paper. The case of glioblastoma
	multiforme and its surrounding neural tissue is addressed as a modeling
	paradigm.Methods: A cubic discretizing mesh is superimposed upon
	the anatomic region of interest as is reconstructed from pertinent
	imaging (e.g. MRI) data. On each geometrical cell of the mesh the
	most crucial biological "laws" e.g. metabolism, cell cycling, tumor
	geometry changes, cell kill following irradiation etc. are applied.
	Slowly responding normal neural tissue is modeled by a functional
	compartment containing indivisible cells and a divisible compartment
	containing glial cells.Results. The model code has been executed
	for a simulated period normally covering the radiotherapy course
	duration and extending a few days after its completion. The following
	schemes have been simulated: standard fractionation, hyperfractionation,
	accelerated fractionation, accelerated hyperfractionation and hypofractionation.
	The predictions are in agreement with the outcome of the RTOG 83-02
	phase I/II trial, the retrospective study conducted by Sugawara et
	al. and the theoretical predictions of Duechting et al.Conclusions.
	The presented model, although oversimplified, may serve as a basis
	for a refined simulation of the biological mechanisms involved in
	tumor and normal tissue response to radiotherapy.},

  abstract = {In this paper we compare two alternative theoretical approaches for
	simulating the growth of cell aggregates in vitro: individual cell
	(agent)-based models and continuum models. We show by a quantitative
	analysis of both a biophysical agent-based and a continuum mechanical
	model that for densely packed aggregates the expansion of the cell
	population is dominated by cell proliferation controlled by mechanical
	stress. The biophysical agent-based model introduced earlier (Drasdo
	and Hoehme in Phys Biol 2:133-147, 2005) approximates each cell as
	an isotropic, homogeneous, elastic, spherical object parameterised
	by measurable biophysical and cell-biological quantities and has
	been shown by comparison to experimental findings to explain the
	growth patterns of dense monolayers and multicellular spheroids.
	Both models exhibit the same growth kinetics, with initial exponential
	growth of the population size and aggregate diameter followed by
	linear growth of the diameter and power-law growth of the cell population
	size. Very sparse monolayers can be explained by a very small or
	absent cell-cell adhesion and large random cell migration. In this
	case the expansion speed is not controlled by mechanical stress but
	by random cell migration and can be modelled by the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piskounov
	(FKPP) reaction-diffusion equation. The growth kinetics differs from
	that of densely packed aggregates in that the initial spread, as
	quantified by the radius of gyration, is diffusive. Since simulations
	of the lattice-free agent-based model in the case of very large random
	migration are too long to be practical, lattice-based cellular automaton
	(CA) models have to be used for a quantitative analysis of sparse
	monolayers. Analysis of these dense monolayers leads to the identification
	of a critical parameter of the CA model so that eventually a hierarchy
	of three model types (a detailed biophysical lattice-free model,
	a rule-based cellular automaton and a continuum approach) emerge
	which yield the same growth pattern for dense and sparse cell aggregates.},

	The basis for all of the models is deriving the continuum PDE using

	In the model for the immune response to cancer, working from an initial

	which are used to predict the capacity of the immune system to eradicate
	cancer (or not). In the final model of cancer invasion, once again
	we initially focus on "microscale" activity of matrix degrading enzymes

	is likely to have prognostic value but its diagnosis still awaits
	an accurate and acceptable assay. The recent indications that hypoxia
	can also induce the expression of specific genes and promote a more
	aggressive tumor phenotype makes its diagnosis even more important.
	Over 15 years ago, misonidazole, an azomycin-based hypoxic cell radiosensitizer,
	was found to link covalently to cellular molecules at rates inversely
	proportional to intracellular oxygen concentration. The use of bioreducible
	markers to positively label zones of viable hypoxic cells within
	solid tumors and to predict for tumor radioresistance was proposed.
	Several hypoxic markers have now been identified and their selective
	binding within tumors has been measured by both invasive and non-invasive
	assays. Research from our laboratory has emphasized both mechanistic
	and preclinical studies associated with nuclear medicine procedures
	for measuring tumor hypoxia and predicting tumor radioresistance.
	This report updates radiation oncologists about the status of nuclear
	medicine hypoxic marker research and development as of mid-1997.
	While several potential imaging agents have been identified, their
	testing and validation in appropriate human tumors will require focused
	research efforts by individual academic departments and, possibly,
	by clinical trials performed through cooperative groups. Since the
	prediction of hypoxia in individual tumors could strongly impact
	radiotherapy treatment planning, the radiation oncology research
	community is best positioned to execute the validation studies associated

	to bridge the gap between a macroscopic formulation of tumor growth
	and a mesoscopic one. Thus we are able to establish, as an important
	result of our formalism, a direct correspondence between parameters
	characterizing processes occurring at different scales. In particular,
	we analyze their dependence on an important limiting factor to tumor
	growth, i.e. the extra-cellular matrix pressure. Since the macro
	and meso-models stem from totally different roots (energy conservation
	and clinical observations vs. cell groups dynamics), their consistency
	may be used to validate both approaches. It may also be interesting
	to note that the proposed formalism fits well into a recently proposed
	conjecture of growth laws universality. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All

  abstract = {To what extent the growth dynamics of tumors is controlled by nutrients,
	biomechanical forces and other factors at different stages and in
	different environments is still largely unknown. Here we present
	a biophysical model to study the spatio-temporal growth dynamics
	of two-dimensional tumor monolayers and three-dimensional tumor spheroids
	as a complementary tool to in vitro experiments. Within our model
	each cell is represented as an individual object and parametrized
	by cell-biophysical and cell-kinetic parameters that can all be experimentally
	determined. Hence our modeling strategy allows us to study which
	mechanisms on the microscopic level of individual cells may affect
	the macroscopic properties of a growing tumor. We find the qualitative
	growth kinetics and patterns at early growth stages to be remarkably
	robust. Quantitative comparisons between computer simulations using
	our model and published experimental observations on monolayer cultures
	suggest a biomechanically-mediated form of growth inhibition during
	the experimentally observed transition from exponential to sub-exponential
	growth at sufficiently large tumor sizes. Our simulations show that
	the same transition during the growth of avascular tumor spheroids
	can be explained largely by the same mechanism. Glucose ( or oxygen)
	depletion seems to determine mainly the size of the necrotic core
	but not the size of the tumor. We explore the consequences of the
	suggested biomechanical form of contact inhibition, in order to permit
	an experimental test of our model. Based on our findings we propose
	a phenomenological growth law in early expansion phases in which
	specific biological small-scale processes are subsumed in a small
	number of effective parameters.},

	describes cellular dynamics (proliferation, adhesion, and viability).
	At the subcellular level, a Boolean network regulates the expression

	reaction-diffusion equations describe the chemical dynamics (nutrient,
	waste, growth promoter, and inhibitor concentrations). Data from
	experiments with multicellular spheroids were used to determine the
	parameters of the simulations. Starting with a single tumor cell,
	this model produces an avascular tumor that quantitatively mimics
	experimental measurements in multicellular spheroids. Based on the
	simulations, we predict: 1), the microenvironmental conditions required
	for tumor cell survival; and 2), growth promoters and inhibitors
	have diffusion coefficients in the range between 10(-6) and 10(-7)
	cm(2)/ h, corresponding to molecules of size 80-90 kDa. Using the

  abstract = {The rate of cell loss in irradiated RIF-1, EMT6, KHJJ, B16 and KHT
	tumours was studied using the 125IUdR loss technique. Administration
	of 125IUdR preceded localized tumour irradiation by 2 days. Loss
	of tumour radioactivity was measured for 6--8 days after irradiation.
	the blood flow to some tumours was occluded during, and for 30 min
	following, injection of the label to measure the amount of radioactivity
	entering the tumour as a result of reutilization of label from the
	gut epithelia and influx of labelled host cells. Irradiation did
	not significantly alter the amount of radioactivity entering these
	clamped tumours during the 8--10 days after injection of 125IUdR.
	This permitted comparison of irradiated and control groups based
	on the loss of radioactivity from the non-occluded tumours. Irradiation
	of RIF-1, EMT6, KHJJ or B16 tumours with doses of 600, 1400, 2400
	or 4400 rads produced no significant increase in the rate of loss
	of tumour radioactivity. This suggested that, in the population of
	labelled cells, cell lysis following irradiation proceeded slowly.
	In contrast, KHT tumours showed a significant increase in loss rate
	following each radiation dose, although the increase was dose-independent.
	In all tumour systems, the constant rate of cell loss after radiation
	appeared to coincide with published reports of tumour growth responses
	after irradiation. the present data suggest that the manner of expression
	of radiation-induced cell killing results from the cellular proliferative
	status, i.e. whether a cell is cycling or non-cycling.},

	for viability, regrowth studies showed that there was a longer time
	(25 h) for the 'quiescent' subpopulation than the 'proliferating'
	subpopulation (10 h) before any increase in cell number was observed.
	In addition, relative to the 'proliferating' cells, the 'quiescent'
	cells were more sensitive when exposed to 137Cs gamma-ray radiation.

	Viable cells consume nutrients and become necrotic below critical
	nutrient concentrations. Proliferation of viable cells is contact-inhibited
	if the total cellular density locally exceeds volume carrying capacity.
	The model is discussed under the assumption of spherical symmetry.
	Unknown model parameters are determined by simultaneously fitting
	the cell number to several experimental growth curves for different

	with an analogous off-lattice agent-based model for tumour growth.
	It turns out that the numerically more efficient PDE model suffices
	to explain the macroscopic growth data. As in the agent-based model,
	we find that the experimental growth curves are only reproduced when
	a necrotic core develops. However, evaluation of morphometric properties

  abstract = {Tumours behave as complex, self-organizing, opportunistic dynamic
	systems. In an attempt to better understand and describe the highly
	complicated tumour behaviour, a novel four-dimensional simulation
	model of in vivo tumour growth and response to radiotherapy has been
	developed. This paper presents the latest improvements to the model
	as well as a parametric validation of it. Improvements include an
	advanced algorithm leading to conformal tumour shrinkage, a quantitative
	consideration of the influence of oxygenation on radiosensitivity
	and a more realistic, imaging based description of the neovasculature
	distribution. The tumours selected for the validation of the model
	are a wild type and a mutated p53 gene glioblastomas multiforme.
	According to the model predictions, a whole tumour with larger cell
	cycle duration tends to repopulate more slowly. A lower oxygen enhancement
	ratio value leads to a more radiosensitive whole tumour. Higher clonogenic
	cell density (CCD) produces a higher number of proliferating tumour
	cells and, therefore, a more difficult tumour to treat. Simulation
	predictions agree at least semi-quantitatively with clinical experience,
	and particularly with the outcome of the Radiation Therapy Oncology
	Group (RTOG) Study 83-02. It is stressed that the model allows a
	quantitative study of the interrelationship between the competing
	influences in a complex, dynamic tumour environment. Therefore, the
	model can already be useful as an educational tool with which to
	study, understand and demonstrate the role of various parameters
	in tumour growth and response to irradiation. A long term quantitative
	clinical adaptation and validation of the model aiming at its integration
	into the treatment planning procedure is in progress.},

	The main processes taken into account by the model are the transitions

	and the cell survival probabilities following irradiation. Specific
	algorithms satisfactorily describing tumor expansion and shrinkage

	High-performance computing systems in conjunction with Web technologies
	have coped with the particularly high computer memory and processing
	demands. A visualization system based on the MATLAB software package
	and the virtual-reality modeling language has been employed. Its
	utilization has led to a spectacular representation of both the external

	model has been applied to the special case of small cell lung carcinoma

  abstract = {Diffusion limitations in tumors create regions that are deficient
	in essential nutrients and contain a large number of quiescent and
	dying cells. Chemotherapeutic compounds are not effective against
	quiescent cells and therefore have reduced efficacy against tumors
	with extensive quiescence. We have formulated a mathematical model
	that predicts the extent and location of quiescence in multicellular
	spheroids. Multicellular spheroids are in vitro models of in vivo
	tumor growth that have proven to be useful experimental systems for
	studying radiation therapy, drug penetration, and novel chemotherapeutic
	strategies. Our model incorporates a realistic description of primary
	energy metabolism within reaction-diffusion equations to predict
	local glucose, oxygen, and lactate concentrations and an overall
	spheroid growth rate. The model development is based on the assumption
	that local cellular growth and death rates are determined by local
	ATP production generated by intracellular energy metabolism. Dynamic
	simulation and parametric sensitivity studies are used to evaluate
	model behavior, including the spatial distribution of proliferating,
	quiescent, and dead cells for different cellular characteristics.
	Using this model we have determined the critical cell survival parameters
	that have the greatest impact on overall spheroid physiology, and
	we have found that oxygen transport has a greater effect than glucose
	transport on the distribution of quiescent cells. By predicting the
	extent of quiescence based on individual cellular characteristic
	alone this model has the potential to predict therapeutic efficiency
	and can be used to design effective chemotherapeutic strategies.

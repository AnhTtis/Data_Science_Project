    "abstract": "Around half of all cancer patients, world-wide, will receive some form of radiotherapy (RT) as part of their treatment. And yet, despite the rapid advance of high-throughput screening to identify successful chemotherapy drug candidates, there is no current analogue for RT protocol screening or discovery at any scale. Here we introduce and demonstrate the application of a high-throughput/high-fidelity coupled tumour-irradiation simulation approach, we call \"GPU-GA\", and apply it to human breast cancer analogue - EMT6/Ro spheroids. By analysing over 9.5 million candidate protocols, GPU-GA yields significant gains in tumour suppression versus prior state-of-the-art high-fidelity/-low-throughput computational search under two clinically relevant benchmarks. By extending the search space to hypofractionated areas (> 2 Gy/day) yet within total dose limits, further tumour suppression of up to 33.7% compared to state-of-the-art is obtained. GPU-GA could be applied to any cell line with sufficient empirical data, and to many clinically relevant RT considerations.",

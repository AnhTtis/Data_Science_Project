    "abstract": "We create freely-jointed active polymers using self-propelled droplets as monomeric units, and show that self-shaping chemo-hydrodynamic interactions within the polymer result in novel dissipative structures and steady-states. Our experiments reveal that the interactions between the monomeric droplets give rise to ballistic propulsion of the active polymers and is associated with rigidity and stereotypical shapes of the polymers. These traits, quantified by the curvatures and speeds of the active polymers, vary systematically with the chain length. Using simulations of a minimal model, we establish that the emergent propulsion and rigidity are a generic consequence of quasi two-dimensional confinement and auto-repulsive chemical interactions between the freely jointed active droplets. Finally, we tune the interplay between the chemical and hydrodynamic fields to experimentally demonstrate oscillatory dynamics of the rigid polymer propulsion. Altogether, our work highlights the possible first steps towards synthetic self-morphic active matter.",

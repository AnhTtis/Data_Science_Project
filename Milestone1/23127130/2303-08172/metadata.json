    "abstract": "We prove that the cut-and-paste K-theory of polyhedra, also called scissors congruence K-theory, is a homotopy orbit spectrum. More generally, we show that a broad class of algebraic K-theory constructions, based on covering families, all commute with the formation of homotopy orbits. In other words, \"K-theory of coverings\" always has a Farrell-Jones type isomorphism. Finally, we introduce a trace map for K-theory of coverings, and use it to prove the existence of some classes in the higher K-theory of polyhedra.",

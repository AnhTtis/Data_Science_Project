    "abstract": "Numerical evidence suggests that the Random Field Ising Model loses Parisi-Sourlas SUSY and the dimensional reduction property somewhere between 4 and 5 dimensions, while a related model of branched polymers retains these features in any $d$. These notes give a leisurely introduction to a recent theory, developed jointly with A. Kaviraj and E. Trevisani, which aims to explain these facts. Based on the lectures given in Cortona and at the IHES in 2022.",

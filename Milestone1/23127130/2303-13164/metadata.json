    "abstract": "In this work, we study the parameterized black hole solution by applying the Newman-Janis approach and also examine the Hawking temperature. We consider a Lagrangian field equation associated with the generalized uncertainty principle to study the motion of boson particles. By using semi-classical phenomenon, we analyze the modified Hawking temperature and graphically check the effects of deformation, rotation and correction parameter on black hole geometry. Furthermore, we investigate the logarithmic corrected entropy and also analyze the graphical behavior of deformation and quantum gravity parameter on the logarithmic corrected entropy of black hole.",

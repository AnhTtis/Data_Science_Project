    "abstract": "An orthomorphism of a finite group $G$ is a bijection $φ\\colon G\\to G$ such that $g\\mapsto g^{-1}φ(g)$ is also a bijection. In 1981, Friedlander, Gordon, and Tannenbaum conjectured that when $G$ is abelian, for any $k\\geq 2$ dividing $|G|-1$, there exists an orthomorphism of $G$ fixing the identity and permuting the remaining elements as products of disjoint $k$-cycles. We prove this conjecture for all sufficiently large groups.",

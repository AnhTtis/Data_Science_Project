    "abstract": "The efficiency of particle acceleration at shock waves in relativistic, magnetized astrophysical outflows is a debated topic with far-reaching implications. Here, for the first time, we study the impact of turbulence in the pre-shock plasma. Our simulations demonstrate that, for a mildly relativistic, magnetized pair shock (Lorentz factor $γ_{\\rm sh} \\simeq 2.7$, magnetization level $σ\\simeq 0.01$), strong turbulence can revive particle acceleration in a superluminal configuration that otherwise prohibits it. Depending on the initial plasma temperature and magnetization, stochastic-shock-drift or diffusive-type acceleration governs particle energization, producing powerlaw spectra $\\mathrm{d}N/\\mathrm{d}γ\\propto γ^{-s}$ with $s \\sim 2.5-3.5$. At larger magnetization levels, stochastic acceleration within the pre-shock turbulence becomes competitive and can even take over shock acceleration.",

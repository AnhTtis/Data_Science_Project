    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is a futuristic technology that promises to connect tons of devices via the internet. As more individuals connect to the internet, it is believed that communication will generate mountains of data. IoT is currently leveraging Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) to collect, monitor, and transmit data and sensitive data across wireless networks using sensor nodes. WSNs encounter a variety of threats posed by attackers, including unauthorized access and data security. Especially in the context of the Internet of Things, where small embedded devices with limited computational capabilities, such as sensor nodes, are expected to connect to a larger network. As a result, WSNs are vulnerable to a variety of attacks. Furthermore, implementing security is time-consuming and selective, as traditional security algorithms degrade network performance due to their computational complexity and inherent delays. This paper describes an encryption algorithm that combines the Secure IoT (SIT) algorithm with the Security Protocols for Sensor Networks (SPINS) security protocol to create the Lightweight Security Algorithm (LSA), which addresses data security concerns while reducing power consumption in WSNs without sacrificing performance.",

In this section, $M$ is a fixed submonoid of $T_n$. We explain how to combinatorially compute the characters of three interesting modules: 
$\kbf J$ for a $\jc$-class $J$, $\kbf M$ as $\kbf M-\module-\kbf M$ and $\kbf \lc(e)$ for an $\lc$-class containing an idempotent $e$ as a $\kbf M-\module-\kbf G_e$. For clarity, we will designate these characters as \emph{bicharacters}.

We begin by discussing the computational hypotheses we make before presenting the algorithms themselves.
In a third subsection, we detail how to compute the radical of $\kbf \lc(e)$ to apply our formula from Proposition \ref{prop:formula_char} to compute the character table of a monoid. This latter case is not as tidy as the former ones, as we don't have a purely combinatorial way of computing the radical.

   abstract = {The interaction of quantum systems with mechanical resonators is of practical interest for applications in quantum information and sensing and also of fundamental interest as hybrid quantum systems. Achieving a large and tunable interaction strength is of great importance in this field as it enables controlled access to the quantum limit of motion and coherent interactions between different quantum systems. This has been challenging with solid state spins, where typically the coupling is weak and cannot be tuned. Here we use pairs of coupled quantum dots embedded within cantilevers to achieve a high coupling strength of the singlet−triplet spin system to mechanical motion through strain. Two methods of achieving strong, tunable coupling are demonstrated. The first is through different strain-induced energy shifts for the two QDs when the cantilever vibrates, resulting in changes to the exchange interaction. The second is through a laser-driven AC Stark shift that is sensitive to strain-induced shifts of the optical transitions. Both of these mechanisms can be tuned to zero with electrical bias or laser power, respectively, and give large spin-mechanical coupling strengths. KEYWORDS: Double quantum dots, hybrid quantum systems, spin, optomechanics, cantilever, strain S pin is typically the most coherent degree of freedom of any quantum system due to its weak coupling to the environment. While this makes spin a good choice for storing quantum information, it is often difficult to controllably couple a spin quantum bit (qubit) to other degrees of freedom and other qubits, which poses a problem for applications in quantum sensing and computation. In recent years, there has been significant effort to couple solid state quantum systems to mechanical resonators, 1−10 as mechanical motion is seen as a universal transducer between disparate quantum systems. 11−15 While this area of hybrid quantum systems has seen dramatic progress in achieving strong coupling to mechanical motion and cooling to the quantum ground state of the mechanical resonator, 2,5,15−17 most of this work has not taken advantage of spin, due to relatively weak spin-mechanical coupling. Some early efforts to couple spin to motion have focused on magnetic coupling by placing the spin in a strong magnetic field gradient, such that displacement changes the field at the position of the spin. The coupling strength tends to be limited by the strength of the magnetic field gradient, and so far relatively small single phonon couplings have been achieved. 1,3 More recent efforts have made use of intrinsic strain coupling, in which strain produced within the mechanical structure modifies the electronic states. 4,6−8,10,15,18−27 This coupling is typically quite weak for electron spins, but recent results on hole spins in InGaAs quantum dots (QDs) and the silicon vacancy in diamond have shown significantly better couplings , 10,25 due to the stronger spin−orbit interaction. The use of surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices that operate at high mechanical frequencies is also promising for improving single phonon coupling to spin. 14,23,27 In all of these cases, the spin-mechanical coupling strength is difficult to control in situ and obtaining strong coupling is quite challenging. Here we present results on pairs of interacting InGaAs QDs embedded in cantilevers, in which two new spin-mechanical coupling mechanisms are demonstrated, which are much stronger than other mechanisms and are tunable to zero coupling. Each QD is charged with a single electron, using a built-in diode, and tunnel coupling between QDs results in a singlet−triplet ground state spin system. These quantum dot molecules (QDMs) have the advantage of a large exchange splitting even at zero magnetic field, 28−30 tunable interactions and optical transitions, 31−33 and a weaker hyperfine interaction. 34 The first physical mechanism is due to the time-dependent strain gradient within the vibrating cantilever, where the strain},

   abstract = {We demonstrate experimentally the possibility to manipulate the coupling strength in an asymmetric pair of electronically coupled InGaAs quantum dots by using externally induced strain fields. The coupling strength of holes confined in the dots increases linearly with increasing tensile strain. A model based on k· p theory explains the effect in terms of modified weight of the light hole component mediating the coupling in the barrier. Our results are relevant to the creation and control of entangled states in optically active quantum dots. A quantum dot molecule (QDM)-two semiconductor QDs separated by a thin barrier-represents a striking example of the analogy between artificial and natural atomic combinations. Similar to the energy levels in a hydrogen molecule, bonding and antibonding states are formed via coherent tunneling [1] of charges in a QDM, giving rise to anticrossing (AC) patterns in the electric-field dependent photoluminescence (PL) spectra [2-5]. This artificial quantum system has a potential application as a quantum gate in quantum information processing [6-8], mainly due to the possibility to initialize and control entanglement between solid-state qubits [9-13]. Although the fine structure of the optical spectra and the spin properties of QDMs made of two vertically stacked InGaAs QDs in a GaAs matrix are now well understood [11,14-16], active control of the coupling strength between the two QDs-the key parameter determining the operation rate of quantum gates [9,10]-still needs to be demonstrated. In particular, the probability of a Landau-Zener transition [17] (the transition from one AC branch to the other), important in qubit manipulation [10], increases exponentially as the coupling strength is decreased. Some qubit proposals [1] also require comparable electron and hole tunneling rates [13]. Contrary to (optically inactive) electrostatically defined QDMs [18,19], the spacer thickness in vertical QDMs is frozen and there is no growth protocol [20] allowing an active control over the spin qubit. A postgrowth tuning of the coherent tunneling would overcome this shortcoming. Longitudinal or transverse magnetic fields were predicted to affect the coupling strength in vertical QDMs [21-24], but more recent experiments and refined theoretical treatments have shown no significant changes for fields up to 6 T [25]. Therefore, it remains unclear if and how the tunneling rate of carriers in a vertical QDM can be tuned. In this Rapid Communication, we demonstrate active tuning of the coupling strength of holes confined in individual InGaAs/GaAs QDMs by externally induced strains. Eight-band k· p calculations reveal that the origin of the observed effect is a strain-induced modification of the heavy hole (HH) * e.zallo@ifw-dresden.de and light hole (LH) effective confinement potentials, which in turn change the probability density for the hole states and thus the coupling strength between the dots. The device design employed in this work [26,27] allows large stress and electric fields to be applied to single QDMs. The QDMs consist of two vertically stacked InGaAs QDs [28] embedded in the intrinsic region of n-i-p nanomem-branes integrated onto piezoelectric actuators made of lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate (PMN-PT); see Fig. 1(a). The QDs are grown on a semi-insulating GaAs (001) substrate by molecular beam epitaxy at the center of a 10 nm thick GaAs/Al 0.4 Ga 0.6 As quantum well, in order to reduce carrier escape at high electric fields (F d) across the diode [29]. The QD height, which has a major influence on the confinement energy, was controlled by means of the indium flush method [30]. The different confined energy levels in the two dots are tuned into resonance by applying a voltage (V d) across the nanomembranes. Simultaneously, in-plane (compressive or tensile) biaxial stress is transferred to the QD layers [31] by applying a voltage (V p) across the PMN-PT. While piezoelectric-induced strains have been used previously to control several properties of semiconductor structures [32-36], their potential in the field of QDMs still needs to be explored. The micro-PL (μPL) measurements were performed at 6 K in a helium flow cryostat with a 50× microscope objective (numerical aperture = 0.42). The device was excited with a 532 nm continuous-wave laser and the signal was collected by the same microscope objective used for the excitation and analyzed by a single (double) spectrometer featuring ∼30 μeV (∼15 μeV) spectral resolution. The degree of linear polarization of the PL signal was analyzed by combining a rotatable achromatic half-wave plate and a fixed linear polarizer. For more details see the Supplemental Material [37]. Figure 1(b) shows the simultaneous effect of electric and strain fields on a representative InGaAs QDM. By sweeping the electric field across the diode (F d in [−14.4,−6.5] kV/cm), the X-shaped pattern of the positively charged exciton (X +) [4] can be clearly observed. The magnitude of AC energy gaps (E AC) [20], defined as the minimum energy splitting between bonding and antibonding states, and polarized cross-correlation measurements between X + and X 0 [38] confirm},

Strain reduces the tunneling and hence the critical interdot distance required for the ground state to change from bonding to antibonding. The reduced spin-orbit interaction in the GaAs matrix, which we account for using position-dependent Luttinger parameters, has the opposite effect. This compensation results in the critical distance being little affected. The possibility to induce the bonding-to-antibonding transition using longitudinal magnetic fields is also investigated. Luttinger-Kohn Hamiltonian predicts a magnetic enhancement of the heavy hole-light hole coupling which, in turn, leads to such transition. No such effect is, however, observed in magnetophotoluminescence experiments.

   abstract = {We perform full time-resolved tomographic measurements of the polarization state of pairs of photons emitted during the radiative cascade of the confined biexciton in a semiconductor quantum dot. The biexciton was deterministically initiated using a π-area pulse into the biexciton two-photon absorption resonance. Our measurements demonstrate that the polarization states of the emitted photon pair are maximally entangled. We show that the measured degree of entanglement depends solely on the temporal resolution by which the time difference between the emissions of the photon pair is determined. A route for fabricating an on-demand source of maximally polarization entangled photon pairs is thereby provided. The ability to generate entangled photons on demand is crucial for many future applications in quantum information processing. Devices based on the biexciton-exciton radiative cascade in a single semiconductor quantum dot (QD) are considered to be one of the best candidates for these applications [1-3]. The ability to deterministically excite the biexciton using its two-photon absorption resonance [4,5] makes this avenue even more promising. A remaining challenge, however, is the excitonic fine structure, which splits the two exciton eigenstates, thus providing spectral "which-path" information on the radiative cascade and preventing the pairs of emitted photons from being polarization entangled [2]. Various strategies were tried in an attempt to reduce the influence of the fine structure splitting, such as spectral [2] and temporal filtering [2,6], which introduced nondesired, nondeterministic post-selection, and enhancement of the radiative rate using the Purcell effect [3], thereby reducing but not limiting the effect of exciton precession. Attempts to reduce the fine-structure splitting using heat treatment [7] or growth along the [111] crystalographic direction [8] were reported as well as applications of external stress [9] and electric [10] and magnetic field tuning [11,12]. These efforts often result in unwanted loss of emission quantum efficiency [10] and increase in the exciton spin decoherence [6]. We present here a study of a single semiconductor quantum dot, optically depleted [13] and then resonantly excited on demand by a π-area pulse to the biexciton two-photon absorption resonance [5]. The resulting pairs of biexciton and exciton photons are detected by two superconducting detectors synchronized to the exciting laser pulse. By performing synchronized time-resolved polarization tomography of the two emitted photons, we unambiguously show that the photons remain maximally polarization entangled during the whole radiative decay, and that the measured degree of entanglement does not depend on the QD source, but rather depends on the temporal resolution by which the time difference between * dg@physics.technion.ac.il the two photon emissions can be determined. Since during the radiative decay the exciton does not lose coherence, there is no need to eliminate the excitonic fine structure splitting. A relatively simple arrangement [14,15] should therefore provide a reliable source of on-demand pairs of maximally entangled photons from a single quantum dot, regardless of its nonvanishing excitonic fine structure splitting. I. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND The biexciton-exciton radiative cascade is schematically described in Fig. 1(a). In the figure, resonant excitation of the biexciton using a π-area pulse to the virtual two-photon excitation (TPE) resonance [5,16-18] is described by an upward green arrow. The power required to achieve the TPE π pulse (2.53 μW) is about an order of magnitude larger than that required for the exciton (0.25 μW), in agreement with Ref. [17]. At this power level, no residual absorption off the TPE resonance was observed, indicating negligible free carrier photogeneration. The 12 ps long resonant TPE pulse follows a few nanosecond long optical depletion pulse [13] which empties the QD of charges and long-lived dark excitons. The π-area pulse therefore deterministically photogenerates a confined ground state biexciton (|XX 0) in the QD [5,16]. The biexciton spontaneously radiatively decays, leaving in the QD an exciton in a coherent superposition of its two eigenstates: the |X 0 H and the |X 0 V states [19,20]. The optical selection rules for the biexciton radiative recombination and the lack of information by "which path" the recombination proceeds result in entanglement between the exciton state and the polarization state of the emitted photon [21-23]. Their mutual wave function is given by ψ P 1 X 0 = 1 √ 2 H 1 X 0 H + V 1 X 0 V , (1) where |H 1 and |V 1 are the two rectilinear polarization states of the first (biexciton) photon. Since the two exciton eigenstates are not degenerate, the relative phase between these eigenstates precesses in time with a period of T P = h//, where h is the Planck constant and is the exciton fine 2469-9950/2017/95(23)/235435(7) 235435-1},

Symmetry of the dot structures as well as its breaking cause characteristic features in the optical spectra, which are determined by the electron-hole exchange and the Zeeman interaction of the carriers. The symmetry breaking is either inherent to the dot due to geometry asymmetries, or it can be obtained by applying a magnetic field with an orientation different from the dot symmetry axis. From data on spin splitting and on polarization of the emission we can identify neutral as well as charged exciton complexes. For dots with weakly broken symmetry, the angular momentum of the neutral exciton is no longer a good quantum number and the exchange interaction lifts degeneracies within the fine-structure manifold. The symmetry can be restored by a magnetic field due to the comparatively strong Zeeman interactions of electron and hole. For dots with a strongly broken symmetry, bright and dark excitons undergo a strong hybridization, as evidenced by pronounced anticrossings when states within the manifold are brought into resonance. The fine structure can no longer be described within the frame developed for structures of higher dimensionality. In particular, the hybridization cannot be broken magnetically.

   abstract = {The interaction between two quantum bits enables the creation of entanglement, the two-particle correlations that are at the heart of quantum information science. In semiconductor quantum dots, much work has focused on demonstrating control over single spin qubits using optical techniques. However, optical control of two spin qubits remains a major challenge for scaling to a fully fledged quantum-information platform. Here, we combine advances in vertically stacked quantum dots with ultrafast laser techniques to achieve optical control of the entangled state of two electron spins. Each electron is in a separate InAs quantum dot, and the spins interact through tunnelling, where the tunnelling rate determines how rapidly entangling operations can be carried out. We achieve two-qubit gates with an interaction rate of 30 GHz, more than an order of magnitude faster than demonstrated in any other system so far. These results demonstrate the viability and advantages of optically controlled quantum-dot spins for multi-qubit systems. Optical control over electron spins embedded in semiconductor structures is an efficient way of manipulating quantum information. But a fully fledged quantum information processor will require control over two-spin states. This has now been demonstrated, including the implementation of ‘ultrafast’ two-qubit gate operations that take less than a nanosecond.},

This is accomplished using two variably polarized and independently tuned picosecond laser pulses. The first "writes" the spin state of the resonantly excited exciton. The second is tuned to biexcitonic resonances, and its absorption is used to "read" the exciton spin state. The absorption of the second pulse depends on its polarization relative to the exciton spin direction. Changes in the exciton spin result in corresponding changes in the intensity of the photoluminescence from the biexciton lines which we monitor, obtaining thus a one-to-one mapping between any point on the Poincaré sphere of the light polarization to a point on the Bloch sphere of the exciton spin. © 2011 American Physical Society.},

We discuss the simplest model Hamiltonians that realize topological protection and their implementation in superconducting arrays. We focus on two dual realizations: in one the protected state is stored in the parity of the Cooper pair number, in the other, in the parity of the flux number. In both cases the superconducting arrays allow a number of fault-tolerant operations that should make the universal quantum computation possible. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Here, an electric field tunable QDM that can be optically charged with one (1h) or two holes (2h) on demand is presented. A four-phase optical and electric field control sequence facilitates the sequential preparation of the 2h charge state and subsequently allows flexible control of the inter-dot coupling. Charges are loaded via optical pumping and electron tunnel ionization. One- and two-hole charging efficiencies of (93.5 ± 0.8)% and (80.5 ± 1.3)% are achieved, respectively. Combining efficient charge state preparation and precise setting of inter-dot coupling allows for the control of few-spin qubits, as would be required for the on-demand generation of 2D photonic cluster states or quantum transduction between microwaves and photons.},

Symmetry of the dot structures as well as its breaking cause characteristic features in the optical spectra, which are determined by the electron-hole exchange and the Zeeman interaction of the carriers. The symmetry breaking is either inherent to the dot due to geometry asymmetries, or it can be obtained by applying a magnetic field with an orientation different from the dot symmetry axis.

abstract = {A survey is carried out for both electron and heavy-hole effective masses in InAs, InSb, GaAs, GaSb and some of their ternary compounds. Our computations are based on the pseudopotential method. To make allowance for the chemical disorder, the virtual crystal approximation is used, including a correction to the alloy potential. The agreement between our theoretical results and the experiment is very satisfying. A non-linearity dependence of the electron effective mass on the molar fraction has been shown for the ternary alloys under consideration, which indicates the alloying effect. This non-linearity disappears in the case of the heavy-hole effective mass for GaInSb.}

abstract = {A survey is carried out for both electron and heavy-hole effective masses in InAs, InSb, GaAs, GaSb and some of their ternary compounds. Our computations are based on the pseudopotential method. To make allowance for the chemical disorder, the virtual crystal approximation is used, including a correction to the alloy potential. The agreement between our theoretical results and the experiment is very satisfying. A non-linearity dependence of the electron effective mass on the molar fraction has been shown for the ternary alloys under consideration, which indicates the alloying effect. This non-linearity disappears in the case of the heavy-hole effective mass for GaInSb.}

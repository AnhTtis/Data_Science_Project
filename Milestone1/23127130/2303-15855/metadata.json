    "abstract": "We introduce and study a new class of complex manifolds, Oka-1 manifolds, characterized by the property that holomorphic maps from any open Riemann surface to the manifold satisfy the Runge approximation and the Weierstrass interpolation conditions. We prove that every complex manifold which is dominable at most points by spanning tubes of complex lines in affine spaces is an Oka-1 manifold. In particular, a manifold dominable by $\\mathbb C^n$ at most points is an Oka-1 manifold. We provide many examples of Oka-1 manifolds among compact complex surfaces, including all Kummer surfaces and all elliptic K3 surfaces. The class of Oka-1 manifolds is invariant under Oka maps inducing a surjective homomorphism of fundamental groups; this includes holomorphic fibre bundles with connected Oka fibres. In another direction, we prove that every bordered Riemann surface admits a holomorphic map with dense image in any connected complex manifold. The analogous result holds for holomorphic Legendrian immersions in an arbitrary connected complex contact manifold.",

    "abstract": "Heat conduction equation on a lattice composed of nodes and bonds is formulated assuming the Fourier law and the energy conservation law. Based on this equation, we propose a higher-order topological heat conduction model on the breathing kagome lattice. We show that the temperature measurement at a conner node can detect the corner state which causes rapid heat conduction toward the heat bath, and that several-nodes measurement can determine the precise energy of the corner states.",

\section{Conclusion}
We have introduced \textsf{AIOZ-GDANCE}, the largest dataset for audio-driven group dance generation. Our dataset contains in-the-wild videos and covers different dance styles and music genres. We then propose a strong baseline along with evaluation protocols for group dance generation task. We hope that the release of our dataset will foster more research on audio-driven group choreography.

    "abstract": "Words in a natural language not only transmit information but also evolve with the development of civilization and human migration. The same is true for music. To understand the complex structure behind the music, we introduced an algorithm called the Essential Element Network (EEN) to encode the audio into text. The network is obtained by calculating the correlations between scales, time, and volume. Optimizing EEN to generate Zipfs law for the frequency and rank of the clustering coefficient enables us to generate and regard the semantic relationships as words. We map these encoded words into the scale-temporal space, which helps us organize systematically the syntax in the deep structure of music. Our algorithm provides precise descriptions of the complex network behind the music, as opposed to the black-box nature of other deep learning approaches. As a result, the experience and properties accumulated through these processes can offer not only a new approach to the applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP) but also an easier and more objective way to analyze the evolution and development of music.",

    \caption{Complementary indexing of multiple LUTs. With the proposed novel indexing patterns, MuLUT involves more pixels than a single SR-LUT. For example, With MuLUT-S, MuLUT-D, and MuLUT-Y, the $5 \times 5$ area around $I_0$ is fully covered. The covered pixels with the rotation ensemble trick are marked with dashed boxes.}

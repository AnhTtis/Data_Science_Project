    \caption{Recap of SR-LUT \cite{DBLP:conf/cvpr/JoK21}. Firstly, a deep super-resolution network is trained. Next, a look-up table (LUT) is obtained by caching the output values of the learned deep super-resolution network by traversing all possible inputs. Finally, the prediction results are retrieved by locating query indexes to the minimum grid and interpolating the pre-computed grid values from the LUT. The indexing entries and corresponding HR values of a 4D LUT for $2\times$ super-resolution are marked in \colorbox{myblue}{blue} and \colorbox{mygreen}{green}, respectively. The actual receptive area with the rotation ensemble trick are depicted with dashed lines.}

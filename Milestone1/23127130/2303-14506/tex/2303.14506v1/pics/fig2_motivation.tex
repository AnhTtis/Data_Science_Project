    \caption{(a) For a single LUT, its storage size grows exponentially as the number of covered pixels increases. Our method provides a simple but effective solution to avoid this exponential growth. (b) By enabling cooperation of multiple LUTs, we enlarge the RF from $3 \times 3$ to $9 \times 9$, resulting in a significant performance improvement over SR-LUT while preserving its efficiency. The PSNR values are evaluated on Manga109 for $4\times$ super-resolution.}

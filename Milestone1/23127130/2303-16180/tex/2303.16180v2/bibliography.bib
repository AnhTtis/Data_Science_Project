    abstract = {Single-stranded DNA robots can move over the surface of a DNA origami sheet and sort molecular cargoes. Thubagere et al. developed a simple algorithm for recognizing two types of molecular cargoes and their drop-off destinations on the surface (see the Perspective by Reif). The DNA robot, which has three modular functional domains, repeatedly picks up the two types of molecules and then places them at their target destinations. No additional power is required because the DNA robot does this by random walking across the origami surface. Science, this issue p. eaan6558; see also p. 1095 A single-stranded DNA with modular function domains undergoes a random walk and sorts two molecular cargoes. Two critical challenges in the design and synthesis of molecular robots are modularity and algorithm simplicity. We demonstrate three modular building blocks for a DNA robot that performs cargo sorting at the molecular level. A simple algorithm encoding recognition between cargos and their destinations allows for a simple robot design: a single-stranded DNA with one leg and two foot domains for walking, and one arm and one hand domain for picking up and dropping off cargos. The robot explores a two-dimensional testing ground on the surface of DNA origami, picks up multiple cargos of two types that are initially at unordered locations, and delivers them to specified destinations until all molecules are sorted into two distinct piles. The robot is designed to perform a random walk without any energy supply. Exploiting this feature, a single robot can repeatedly sort multiple cargos. Localization on DNA origami allows for distinct cargo-sorting tasks to take place simultaneously in one test tube or for multiple robots to collectively perform the same task.}}

    abstract = {Cooperation is a strategy that has been adopted by groups of organisms to execute complex tasks more efficiently than single entities. Cooperation increases the robustness and flexibility of the working groups and permits sharing of the workload among individuals. However, the utilization of this strategy in artificial systems at the molecular level, which could enable substantial advances in microrobotics and nanotechnology, remains highly challenging. Here, we demonstrate molecular transportation through the cooperative action of a large number of artificial molecular machines, photoresponsive DNA-conjugated microtubules driven by kinesin motor proteins. Mechanical communication via conjugated photoresponsive DNA enables these microtubules to organize into groups upon photoirradiation. The groups of transporters load and transport cargo, and cargo unloading is achieved by dissociating the groups into single microtubules. The group formation permits the loading and transport of cargoes with larger sizes and in larger numbers over long distances compared with single transporters. We also demonstrate that cargo can be collected at user-determined locations defined by ultraviolet light exposure. This work demonstrates cooperative task performance by molecular machines, which will help to construct molecular robots with advanced functionalities in the future. Swarms of molecular machines derived from DNA-conjugated microtubules can carry and deliver cargo to a target destination.}}

    abstract = {The term programmable matter refers to matter which has the ability to change its physical properties (shape, density, moduli, conductivity, optical properties, etc.) in a programmable fashion, based upon user input or autonomous sensing. This has many applications like smart materials, autonomous monitoring and repair, and minimal invasive surgery, so there is a high relevance of this topic to industry and society in general. While programmable matter has just been science fiction more than two decades ago, a large amount of research activities can now be seen in this field in the recent years. Often programmable matter is envisioned, as a very large number of small locally interacting computational emph{particles}. We propose the Amoebot model, a new model which builds upon this vision of programmable matter. Inspired by the behavior of amoeba, the Amoebot model offers a versatile framework to model self-organizing particles and facilitates rigorous algorithmic research in the area of programmable matter.},

There are two possibilities to change the morphology of such a robot. The first one, self-reconfiguration, moves each module to the right place, whereas the second one, self-assembly docks the modules at the right place. Self-assembly is composed of two steps, (1) identifying the free positions that are available for docking and (2) docking the modules to these positions. This work focuses on the first step. This paper presents a distributed planning algorithm that can decide which positions can be filled and can create any 3D shape, including shapes with internal holes and concavities. Our algorithm consider kinematic constraints and prevents positions from being blocked. Each module embeds the same algorithm and coordinates with the others by means of neighbor-to-neighbor communication.},

    abstract = {Robots programmed with simple construction rules can work independently but collectively to build a complex structure. [Also see Perspective by Korb] Complex systems are characterized by many independent components whose low-level actions produce collective high-level results. Predicting high-level results given low-level rules is a key open challenge; the inverse problem, finding low-level rules that give specific outcomes, is in general still less understood. We present a multi-agent construction system inspired by mound-building termites, solving such an inverse problem. A user specifies a desired structure, and the system automatically generates low-level rules for independent climbing robots that guarantee production of that structure. Robots use only local sensing and coordinate their activity via the shared environment. We demonstrate the approach via a physical realization with three autonomous climbing robots limited to onboard sensing. This work advances the aim of engineering complex systems that achieve specific human-designed goals. In the case of mound-building termites, colonies comprising thousands of independently behaving insects build intricate structures, orders of magnitude larger than themselves, using indirect communication methods. In this process, known as stigmergy, local cues in the structure itself help to direct the workers. Werfel et al. (p. 754; see the Perspective by Korb) wanted to construct complex predetermined structures using autonomous robots. A successful system was designed so that for a given final structure, the robots followed basic rules or “structpaths” in order to complete the task.}}

Motivated by the problem of sealing an object using minimal resources, we show how a particle system can self-organize to form an object's convex hull. We give a distributed, local algorithm for convex hull formation and prove that it runs in O(B) asynchronous rounds, where B is the length of the object's boundary. Within the same asymptotic runtime, this algorithm can be extended to also form the object's (weak) O-hull, which uses the same number of particles but minimizes the area enclosed by the hull. Our algorithms are the first to compute convex hulls with distributed entities that have strictly local sensing, constant-size memory, and no shared sense of orientation or coordinates. Ours is also the first distributed approach to computing restricted-orientation convex hulls. This approach involves coordinating particles as distributed memory; thus, as a supporting but independent result, we present and analyze an algorithm for organizing particles with constant-size memory as distributed binary counters that efficiently support increments, decrements, and zero-tests --- even as the particles move.},

In this paper, we present a universal shape formation algorithm which takes an arbitrary shape composed of a constant number of equilateral triangles of unit size and lets the particles build that shape at a scale depending on the number of particles in the system. Our algorithm runs in O(√n) asynchronous execution rounds, where $n$ is the number of particles in the system, provided we start from a well-initialized configuration of the particles. This is optimal in a sense that for any shape deviating from the initial configuration, any movement strategy would require Ω(√n) rounds in the worst case (over all asynchronous activations of the particles). Our algorithm relies only on local information (e.g., particles do not have ids, nor do they know n, or have any sort of global coordinate system), and requires only a constant-size memory per particle.},

abstract="A finite automaton, simply referred to as a robot, has to explore a graph whose nodes are unlabeled and whose edge ports are locally labeled at each node. The robot has no a priori knowledge of the topology of the graph or of its size. Its task is to traverse all the edges of the graph. We first show that, for any K-state robot and any d≥ 3, there exists a planar graph of maximum degree d with at most K+1 nodes that the robot cannot explore. This bound improves all previous bounds in the literature. More interestingly, we show that, in order to explore all graphs of diameter D and maximum degree d, a robot needs $\Omega$(Dlogd) memory bits, even if we restrict the exploration to planar graphs. This latter bound is tight. Indeed, a simple DFS at depth D+1 enables a robot to explore any graph of diameter D and maximum degree d using a memory of size O(Dlogd) bits. We thus prove that the worst case space complexity of graph exploration is $\Theta$(Dlogd) bits.",

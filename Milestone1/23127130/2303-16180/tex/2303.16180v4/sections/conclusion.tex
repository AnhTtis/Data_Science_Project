\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We provided an algorithm that solves the coating problem in the 3D hybrid model in worst-case optimal $\O(n^2)$ steps given that the initial configuration w.r.t. the surface graph fulfills the property of coatability as specified in \cref{def:coatability}.
While the algorithm solves the problem directly in the class of smooth objects, there are certainly surface graphs that violate coatability.
We bypassed this problem by emulating our algorithm on a subdivision of these surface graphs using $2^{2\Delta}$ types of tiles.
A natural question for future work is whether solving the problem with a single tile type is in fact impossible, and if so, then what is the lowest number of tile types required to solve it.
Another open question is how far our worst-case optimal solution is off from the best case solution.

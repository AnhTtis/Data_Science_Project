\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We provided a generalized algorithm that solves the coating problem in worst-case optimal $\O(n^2)$ steps given that the initial configuration w.r.t. the surface graph fulfills the property of coatability. % as specified in \cref{def:coatability}.
While the algorithm solves the problem directly for any object of the class of smooth objects, % as \cref{fig:triangulation} shows, 
there are objects whose surface graphs violate coatability.
We bypassed this problem by emulating our algorithm on a subdivision of these surface graphs using $2^{2\Delta}$ distinguishable tile types.
An interesting question for future work is whether solving the problem with a single tile type is in fact impossible, and if so, then what is the lowest number of tile types required to solve it.
Another natural open question is how far our worst-case optimal solution is off from the best case solution.

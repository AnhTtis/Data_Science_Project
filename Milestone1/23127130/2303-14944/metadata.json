    "abstract": "Formal specification is a basis for rigorous software implementation. VDM-SL is a formal specification language with an extensive executable subset. Successful cases of VDM-family including VDM-SL have shown that producing a well-tested executable specification can reduce the cost of the implementation phase. This paper introduces and discusses the reversed order of specification and implementation. The development of a multi-agent simulation language called \\remobidyc is described and examined as a case study of defining a formal specification after initial implementation and reflecting the specification into the implementation code.",

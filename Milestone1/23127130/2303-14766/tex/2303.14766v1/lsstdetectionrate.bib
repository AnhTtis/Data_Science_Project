	abstract = {Using the most recent prototypes, design, and as-built system information, we test and quantify the capability of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) to discover Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs) and Near-Earth Objects (NEOs). We empirically estimate an expected upper limit to the false detection rate in LSST image differencing, using measurements on DECam data and prototype LSST software and find it to be about 450 deg−2. We show that this rate is already tractable with current prototype of the LSST Moving Object Processing System (MOPS) by processing a 30-day simulation consistent with measured false detection rates. We proceed to evaluate the performance of the LSST baseline survey strategy for PHAs and NEOs using a high-fidelity simulated survey pointing history. We find that LSST alone, using its baseline survey strategy, will detect 66\% of the PHA and 61\% of the NEO population objects brighter than H=22, with the uncertainty in the estimate of  ± 5 percentage points. By generating and examining variations on the baseline survey strategy, we show it is possible to further improve the discovery yields. In particular, we find that extending the LSST survey by two additional years and doubling the MOPS search window increases the completeness for PHAs to 86\% (including those discovered by contemporaneous surveys) without jeopardizing other LSST science goals (77\% for NEOs). This equates to reducing the undiscovered population of PHAs by additional 26\% (15\% for NEOs), relative to the baseline survey.},

	abstract = {The first interstellar meteor larger than dust was detected by US government sensors in 2014, identified as an interstellar object candidate in 2019, and confirmed by the Department of Defense in 2022. Here, we describe an additional interstellar object candidate in the CNEOS fireball catalog, and compare the implied material strength of the two objects, referred to here as IM1 and IM2, respectively. IM1 and IM2 are ranked 1 and 3 in terms of material strength out of all 273 fireballs in the CNEOS catalog. Fitting a log-normal distribution to material strengths of objects in the CNEOS catalog, IM1 and IM2 are outliers at the levels of \$3.5 {\textbackslash}sigma\$ and \$2.6 {\textbackslash}sigma\$, respectively. The random sampling and Gaussian probabilities, respectively, of picking two objects with such high material strength from the CNEOS catalog, are \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{-6\}\$. If IM2 is confirmed, this implies that interstellar meteors come from a population with material strength characteristically higher than meteors originating from within the solar system. Additionally, we find that if the two objects are representative of a background population on random trajectories, their combined detections imply that \${\textbackslash}sim 40{\textbackslash}\%\$ of all refractory elements are locked in meter-scale interstellar objects. Such a high abundance seemingly defies a planetary system origin.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07224},
	abstract = {The earliest confirmed interstellar object, `Oumuamua, was discovered in the Solar System by Pan-STARRS in 2017, allowing for a calibration of the abundance of interstellar objects of its size \${\textbackslash}sim 100{\textbackslash};\$ m. This was followed by the discovery of Borisov, which allowed for a similar calibration of its size \${\textbackslash}sim 0.4 - 1 {\textbackslash}mathrm\{{\textbackslash}; km\}\$. One would expect a much higher abundance of significantly smaller interstellar objects, with some of them colliding with Earth frequently enough to be noticeable. Based on the CNEOS catalog of bolide events, we identify the \${\textbackslash}sim 0.45\$m meteor detected at 2014-01-08 17:05:34 UTC as originating from an unbound hyperbolic orbit with 99.999{\textbackslash}\% confidence. The U.S. Department of Defense has since verified that "the velocity estimate reported to NASA is sufficiently accurate to indicate an interstellar trajectory." We infer that the meteor had an asymptotic speed of \$v\_\{{\textbackslash}infty\} {\textbackslash}sim 42.1 {\textbackslash}pm 5.5{\textbackslash}; {\textbackslash}mathrm\{km {\textbackslash}; s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$ outside of the solar system. Its origin is approximately towards R.A. \$49.4 {\textbackslash}pm 4.1{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$ and declination \$11.2 {\textbackslash}pm 1.8{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$, implying that its initial velocity vector was \$58{\textbackslash}pm6{\textbackslash}; {\textbackslash}mathrm\{km{\textbackslash};s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$ away from the velocity of the Local Standard of Rest (LSR). Its high LSR speed implies a possible origin from the deep interior of a planetary system or a star in the thick disk of the Milky Way galaxy. The local number density of its population is \$10{\textasciicircum}\{6\{{\textasciicircum}\{+0.75\}\_\{-1.5\}\}\} {\textbackslash}; {\textbackslash}mathrm\{AU{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\}\$ or \$9 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{21\{{\textasciicircum}\{+0.75\}\_\{-1.5\}\}\} {\textbackslash}; {\textbackslash}mathrm\{pc{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\}\$ (necessitating 0.2 -- 20 Earth masses of material to be ejected per local star). We show that the detections of CNEOS 2014-01-08, `Oumuamua, and Borisov collectively imply that the differential size distribution in good agreement with a collisional distribution, with a power-law slope is \$q {\textbackslash}sim 3.6 {\textbackslash}pm 0.5\$, where the quoted uncertainty corresponds to \$2 {\textbackslash}sigma\$.},

The goal of the S3M is to provide a valuable tool in the design and testing of the MOPS software, and will be used in the monitoring of the upcoming Pan-STARRS 1 all-sky survey, which started science operations during late spring of 2010. The model is composed of synthetic populations of near-Earth objects (NEOs with a subpopulation of Earth impactors), the main-belt asteroids (MBAs), Jovian Trojans, Centaurs, trans-Neptunian objects (classical, resonant, and scattered trans-Neptunian objects [TNOs]), Jupiter-family comets (JFCs), long-period comets (LPCs), and interstellar comets. The model reasonably reproduces the true populations to a minimum of V = 24.5, corresponding to approximately the expected limiting magnitude for Pan-STARRS’s ability to detect moving objects. The NEO synthetic population has been extended to H {\textless} 25 (corresponding to objects of about 50 m in diameter), allowing for close flybys of the Earth to be modeled.},

It will be capable of identifying detections of moving objects in our solar system and linking those detections within and between nights, attributing those detections to known objects, calculating initial and differentially corrected orbits for linked detections, precovering detections when they exist, and orbit identification. Here we describe new kd-tree and variable-tree algorithms that allow fast, efficient, scalable linking of intra and inter-night detections. Using a pseudo-realistic simulation of the Pan-STARRS survey strategy incorporating weather, astrometric accuracy and false detections we have achieved nearly 100\% efficiency and accuracy for intra-night linking and nearly 100\% efficiency for inter-night linking within a lunation. At realistic sky-plane densities for both real and false detections the intra-night linking of detections into ‘tracks’ currently has an accuracy of 0.3\%. Successful tests of the MOPS on real source detections from the Spacewatch asteroid survey indicate that the MOPS is capable of identifying asteroids in real data.},

The key elements of the study were a high-fidelity detection model and the presence of false detections in the form of both statistical noise and difference image artifacts. We employed the Moving Object Processing System (MOPS) to generate tracklets, tracks, and orbits with a realistic detection density for one month of the LSST survey. The main goals of the study were to understand whether (a) the linking of near-Earth objects (NEOs) into orbits can succeed in a realistic survey, (b) the number of false tracks and orbits will be manageable, and (c) the accuracy of linked orbits would be sufficient for automated processing of discoveries and attributions. We found that the overall density of asteroids was more than 5000 per LSST field near opposition on the ecliptic, plus up to 3000 false detections per field in good seeing. We achieved 93.6\% NEO linking efficiency for on tracks composed of tracklets from at least three distinct nights within a 12 day interval. The derived NEO catalog was comprised of 96\% correct linkages. Less than 0.1\% of orbits included false detections, and the remainder of false linkages stemmed from main belt confusion, which was an artifact of the short time span of the simulation. The MOPS linking efficiency can be improved by refined attribution of detections to known objects and by improved tuning of the internal kd-tree linking algorithms.},

The albedos of 428 near Earth asteroids (NEAs) observed by WISE during its fully cryogenic mission can be fit quite well by a three parameter function that is the sum of two Rayleigh distributions. The Rayleigh distribution is zero for negative values, and follows for positive x. The peak value is at x = σ, so the position and width are tied together. The three parameters are the fraction of the objects in the dark population, the position of the dark peak, and the position of the brighter peak. We find that 25.3\% of the NEAs observed by WISE are in a very dark population peaking at pV = 0.030, while the other 74.7\% of the NEAs seen by WISE are in a moderately dark population peaking at pV = 0.168. A consequence of this bimodal distribution is that the congressional mandate to find 90\% of all NEAs larger than 140 m diameter cannot be satisfied by surveying to H = 22 mag, since a 140 m diameter asteroid at the very dark peak has H = 23.7 mag, and more than 10\% of NEAs are darker than pV = 0.03.},

Additionally, using a nonphysical grid population, we demonstrate that MOPS can detect populations of currently unknown objects such as interstellar asteroids. MOPS has been adapted successfully to the prototype Pan-STARRS1 telescope despite differences in expected false detection rates, fill-factor loss, and relatively sparse observing cadence compared to a hypothetical Pan-STARRS4 telescope and survey. MOPS remains highly efficient at detecting objects but drops to 80\% efficiency at producing orbits. This loss is primarily due to configurable MOPS processing limits that are not yet tuned for the Pan-STARRS1 mission. The core MOPS software package is the product of more than 15 person-years of software development and incorporates countless additional years of effort in third-party software to perform lower-level functions such as spatial searching or orbit determination. We describe the high-level design of MOPS and essential subcomponents, the suitability of MOPS for other survey programs, and suggest a road map for future MOPS development.},

The survey shows that if the project is able to reliably generate linked sets of positions and times (a so-called “tracklet”) using two detections of a given object per night and can link these tracklets into a track with a minimum of three tracklets covering more than a ∼12 day length-of-arc, then they would be able to discover 62\% of the potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs) larger than 140 m in its projected 10 year survey lifetime. This completeness would be reduced to 58\% if the project is unable to implement a pipeline using the two detection cadence and has to adopt the four detection cadence more commonly used by existing NEO surveys. When including the estimated performance from the current operating surveys, assuming these would continue running until the start of LSST and perhaps beyond, the completeness fraction for PHAs larger than 140 m would be 73\% for the baseline cadence and 71\% for the four detection cadence. This result is a lower completeness than the estimate of Ivezic et al.; however, the result is quite close to that of Jones et al., who show ∼70\% completeness using the identical survey cadence as used here. We show that the traditional method of using absolute magnitude mag as a proxy for the population with diameters larger than 140 m results in completeness values that are too high by ∼5\%. Our simulation makes use of the most recent models of the physical and orbital properties of the NEO and PHA populations, as well as simulated cadences and telescope performance estimates provided by the LSST project. The consistency of the results presented here when compared to those of Jones et al. demonstrates the robustness of these survey modeling approaches. We also show that while neither LSST nor a space-based IR platform like NEOCam individually can complete the survey for 140 m diameter NEOs, the combination of these systems can achieve that goal after a decade of observation.},

	abstract = {(Abridged) The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) is currently by far the most ambitious proposed ground-based optical survey. Solar System mapping is one of the four key scientific design drivers, with emphasis on efficient Near-Earth Object (NEO) and Potentially Hazardous Asteroid (PHA) detection, orbit determination, and characterization. In a continuous observing campaign of pairs of 15 second exposures of its 3,200 megapixel camera, LSST will cover the entire available sky every three nights in two photometric bands to a depth of V=25 per visit (two exposures), with exquisitely accurate astrometry and photometry. Over the proposed survey lifetime of 10 years, each sky location would be visited about 1000 times. The baseline design satisfies strong constraints on the cadence of observations mandated by PHAs such as closely spaced pairs of observations to link different detections and short exposures to avoid trailing losses. Equally important, due to frequent repeat visits LSST will effectively provide its own follow-up to derive orbits for detected moving objects. Detailed modeling of LSST operations, incorporating real historical weather and seeing data from LSST site at Cerro Pachon, shows that LSST using its baseline design cadence could find 90\% of the PHAs with diameters larger than 250 m, and 75\% of those greater than 140 m within ten years. However, by optimizing sky coverage, the ongoing simulations suggest that the LSST system, with its first light in 2013, can reach the Congressional mandate of cataloging 90\% of PHAs larger than 140m by 2020.},

	abstract = {The earliest confirmed interstellar object, `Oumuamua, was discovered in the Solar System by Pan-STARRS in 2017, allowing for a calibration of the abundance of interstellar objects of its size \${\textbackslash}sim 100{\textbackslash};\$ m. This was followed by the discovery of Borisov, which allowed for a similar calibration of its size \${\textbackslash}sim 0.4 - 1 {\textbackslash}mathrm\{{\textbackslash}; km\}\$. One would expect a much higher abundance of significantly smaller interstellar objects, with some of them colliding with Earth frequently enough to be noticeable. Based on the CNEOS catalog of bolide events, we identify the \${\textbackslash}sim 0.45\$m meteor detected at 2014-01-08 17:05:34 UTC as originating from an unbound hyperbolic orbit with 99.999{\textbackslash}\% confidence. The U.S. Department of Defense has since verified that "the velocity estimate reported to NASA is sufficiently accurate to indicate an interstellar trajectory." We infer that the meteor had an asymptotic speed of \$v\_\{{\textbackslash}infty\} {\textbackslash}sim 42.1 {\textbackslash}pm 5.5{\textbackslash}; {\textbackslash}mathrm\{km {\textbackslash}; s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$ outside of the solar system. Its origin is approximately towards R.A. \$49.4 {\textbackslash}pm 4.1{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$ and declination \$11.2 {\textbackslash}pm 1.8{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$, implying that its initial velocity vector was \$58{\textbackslash}pm6{\textbackslash}; {\textbackslash}mathrm\{km{\textbackslash};s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$ away from the velocity of the Local Standard of Rest (LSR). Its high LSR speed implies a possible origin from the deep interior of a planetary system or a star in the thick disk of the Milky Way galaxy. The local number density of its population is \$10{\textasciicircum}\{6\{{\textasciicircum}\{+0.75\}\_\{-1.5\}\}\} {\textbackslash}; {\textbackslash}mathrm\{AU{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\}\$ or \$9 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{21\{{\textasciicircum}\{+0.75\}\_\{-1.5\}\}\} {\textbackslash}; {\textbackslash}mathrm\{pc{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\}\$ (necessitating 0.2 -- 20 Earth masses of material to be ejected per local star). We show that the detections of CNEOS 2014-01-08, `Oumuamua, and Borisov collectively imply that the differential size distribution in good agreement with a collisional distribution, with a power-law slope is \$q {\textbackslash}sim 3.6 {\textbackslash}pm 0.5\$, where the quoted uncertainty corresponds to \$2 {\textbackslash}sigma\$.},

	abstract = {The first interstellar meteor larger than dust was detected by US government sensors in 2014, identified as an interstellar object candidate in 2019, and confirmed by the Department of Defense in 2022. Here, we describe an additional interstellar object candidate in the CNEOS fireball catalog, and compare the implied material strength of the two objects, referred to here as IM1 and IM2, respectively. IM1 and IM2 are ranked 1 and 3 in terms of material strength out of all 273 fireballs in the CNEOS catalog. Fitting a log-normal distribution to material strengths of objects in the CNEOS catalog, IM1 and IM2 are outliers at the levels of \$3.5 {\textbackslash}sigma\$ and \$2.6 {\textbackslash}sigma\$, respectively. The random sampling and Gaussian probabilities, respectively, of picking two objects with such high material strength from the CNEOS catalog, are \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{-6\}\$. If IM2 is confirmed, this implies that interstellar meteors come from a population with material strength characteristically higher than meteors originating from within the solar system. Additionally, we find that if the two objects are representative of a background population on random trajectories, their combined detections imply that \${\textbackslash}sim 40{\textbackslash}\%\$ of all refractory elements are locked in meter-scale interstellar objects. Such a high abundance seemingly defies a planetary system origin.},

Each piece of sky has ∼20 runs contributing and thus reaches ∼2 mag fainter than the SDSS single pass data, i.e., to r ∼ 23.5 for galaxies. We discuss the image processing of the coaddition, the modeling of the point-spread function (PSF), the calibration, and the production of standard SDSS catalogs. The data have an r-band median seeing of 1.″1 and are calibrated to ⩽1\%. Star color–color, number counts, and PSF size versus modeled size plots show that the modeling of the PSF is good enough for precision five-band photometry. Structure in the PSF model versus magnitude plot indicates minor PSF modeling errors, leading to misclassification of stars as galaxies, as verified using VVDS spectroscopy. There are a variety of uses for this wide-angle deep imaging data, including galactic structure, photometric redshift computation, cluster finding and cross wavelength measurements, weak lensing cluster mass calibrations, and cosmic shear measurements.},

	abstract = {During the planet formation process, billions of comets are created and ejected into interstellar space. The detection and characterization of such interstellar comets (ICs) (also known as extra-solar planetesimals or extra-solar comets) would give us in situ information about the efficiency and properties of planet formation throughout the galaxy. However, no ICs have ever been detected, despite the fact that their hyperbolic orbits would make them readily identifiable as unrelated to the solar system. Moro-Martín et al. have made a detailed and reasonable estimate of the properties of the IC population. We extend their estimates of detectability with a numerical model that allows us to consider “close” ICs, e.g., those that come within the orbit of Jupiter. We include several constraints on a “detectable” object that allow for realistic estimates of the frequency of detections expected from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and other surveys. The influence of several of the assumed model parameters on the frequency of detections is explored in detail. Based on the expectation from Moro-Martín et al., we expect that LSST will detect 0.001–10 ICs during its nominal 10 year lifetime, with most of the uncertainty from the unknown number density of small (nuclei of ∼0.1–1 km) ICs. Both asteroid and comet cases are considered, where the latter includes various empirical prescriptions of brightening. Using simulated LSST-like astrometric data, we study the problem of orbit determination for these bodies, finding that LSST could identify their orbits as hyperbolic and determine an ephemeris sufficiently accurate for follow-up in about 4–7 days. We give the hyperbolic orbital parameters of the most detectable ICs. Taking the results into consideration, we give recommendations to future searches for ICs.},

We then simulated the detection of the synthetic ISOs using pointing data for each image and average detection efficiencies for each of three contemporary solar system surveys—Pan-STARRS1, the Mt. Lemmon Survey, and the Catalina Sky Survey. These simulations allowed us to determine the surveys’ combined ISO detection efficiency under several different but realistic modes of identifying ISOs in the survey data. Some of the synthetic detected ISOs had eccentricities as small as 1.01, which is in the range of the largest eccentricities of several known comets. Our best CL of implies that the expectation that extra-solar systems form like our solar system, eject planetesimals in the same way, and then distribute them throughout the Galaxy, is too simplistic, or that the SFD or behavior of ISOs as they pass through our solar system is far from expectation.},

Its hyperbolic orbit (eccentricity greater than unity) strongly suggests that it originated outside our solar system; its red color is consistent with substantial space weathering experienced over a long interstellar journey. We carry out a simple calculation of the probability of detecting such an object. We find that the observed detection rate of 1I-like objects can be satisfied if the average mass of ejected material from nearby stars during the process of planetary formation is ∼20 Earth masses, similar to the expected value for our solar system. The current detection rate of such interstellar interlopers is estimated to be 0.2 yr−1, and the expected number of detections over the past few years is almost exactly one. When the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope begins its wide, fast, deep all-sky survey, the detection rate will increase to 1 yr−1. Those expected detections will provide further constraints on nearby planetary system formation through a better estimate of the number and properties of interstellar objects.},

We briefly outline the consequences that this first detection of an interstellar asteroid implies for the planet-forming process, and we assess the near-term prospects for detecting and observing (both remotely and in situ) future solar system visitors of this type. Drawing on detailed heat-transfer calculations that take both ‘Oumuamua’s unusual shape and its chaotic tumbling into account, we affirm that the lack of a detectable coma in deep images of the object very likely arises from the presence of a radiation-modified coating of high molecular weight material (rather than a refractory bulk composition). Assuming that ‘Oumuamua is a typical representative of a larger population with a kinematic distribution similar to Population I stars in the local galactic neighborhood, we calculate expected arrival rates, impact parameters, and velocities of similar objects and assess their prospects for detection using operational and forthcoming facilities. Using ‘Oumuamua as a proof of concept, we assess the prospects for missions that intercept interstellar objects using conventional chemical propulsion. Using a “launch on detection” paradigm, we estimate wait times of order of 10 years between favorable mission opportunities with the detection capabilities of the Large-scale Synoptic Survey Telescope, a figure that will be refined as the population of interstellar asteroids becomes observationally better constrained.},

Furthermore, the physical properties of the ‘first scout’ turned out to be impossible to reconcile with Solar System objects4–6, challenging our view of interstellar minor bodies7,8. Here, we report the identification and early characterization of a new interstellar object, which has an evidently cometary appearance. The body was discovered by Gennady Borisov on 30 August 2019 ut and subsequently identified as hyperbolic by our data mining code in publicly available astrometric data. The initial orbital solution implies a very high hyperbolic excess speed of {\textasciitilde}32 km s−1, consistent with ‘Oumuamua9 and theoretical predictions2,7. Images taken on 10 and 13 September 2019 ut with the William Herschel Telescope and Gemini North Telescope show an extended coma and a faint, broad tail. We measure a slightly reddish colour with a g′–r′ colour index of 0.66 ± 0.01 mag, compatible with Solar System comets. The observed morphology is also unremarkable and best explained by dust with a power-law size-distribution index of –3.7 ± 1.8 and a low ejection speed (44 ± 14 m s−1 for β = 1 particles, where β is the ratio of the solar gravitational attraction to the solar radiation pressure). The nucleus is probably {\textasciitilde}1 km in radius, again a common value among Solar System comets, and has a negligible chance of experiencing rotational disruption. Based on these early characteristics, and putting its hyperbolic orbit aside, 2I/Borisov appears indistinguishable from the native Solar System comets.},

LSST will be a large, wide-field ground-based system designed to obtain repeated images covering the sky visible from Cerro Pachón in northern Chile. The telescope will have an 8.4 m (6.5 m effective) primary mirror, a 9.6 deg2 field of view, a 3.2-gigapixel camera, and six filters (ugrizy) covering the wavelength range 320-1050 nm. The project is in the construction phase and will begin regular survey operations by 2022. About 90\% of the observing time will be devoted to a deep-wide-fast survey mode that will uniformly observe a 18,000 deg2 region about 800 times (summed over all six bands) during the anticipated 10 yr of operations and will yield a co-added map to r ∼ 27.5. These data will result in databases including about 32 trillion observations of 20 billion galaxies and a similar number of stars, and they will serve the majority of the primary science programs. The remaining 10\% of the observing time will be allocated to special projects such as Very Deep and Very Fast time domain surveys, whose details are currently under discussion. We illustrate how the LSST science drivers led to these choices of system parameters, and we describe the expected data products and their characteristics.},

	abstract = {The way an asteroid or other atmosphereless solar system body varies in brightness in response to changing illumination and viewing geometry depends in a very complicated way on the physical and optical properties of its surface and on its overall shape. This paper summarizes the formulation and application of recent photometric models by Hapke (1981, 1984, 1986) and by Lumme and Bowell (1981). In both models, the brightness of a rough and porous surface is parameterized in terms of the optical properties of individual particles, by shadowing between particles, and by the way in which light is scattered among collections of particles. Both models succeed in their goal of fitting the observed photometric behavior of a wide variety of bodies, but neither has led to a very complete understanding of the properties of asteroid regoliths, primarily because, in most cases, the parameters in the present models cannot be adequately constrained by observations of integral brightness alone over a restricted range of phase angles.},

	abstract = {A rapid accumulation of observations and interpretation has followed in the wake of 1I ‘Oumuamua’s passage through the inner solar system. We briefly outline the consequences that this first detection of an interstellar asteroid implies for the planet-forming process, and we assess the near-term prospects for detecting and observing (both remotely and in situ) future solar system visitors of this type. Drawing on detailed heat-transfer calculations that take both ‘Oumuamua’s unusual shape and its chaotic tumbling into account, we affirm that the lack of a detectable coma in deep images of the object very likely arises from the presence of a radiation-modified coating of high molecular weight material (rather than a refractory bulk composition). Assuming that ‘Oumuamua is a typical representative of a larger population with a kinematic distribution similar to Population I stars in the local galactic neighborhood, we calculate expected arrival rates, impact parameters, and velocities of similar objects and assess their prospects for detection using operational and forthcoming facilities. Using ‘Oumuamua as a proof of concept, we assess the prospects for missions that intercept interstellar objects using conventional chemical propulsion. Using a “launch on detection” paradigm, we estimate wait times of order of 10 years between favorable mission opportunities with the detection capabilities of the Large-scale Synoptic Survey Telescope, a figure that will be refined as the population of interstellar asteroids becomes observationally better constrained.},

We provide a rigorous derivation of this quantity to first order in the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit. We also discuss the effect of the precession of the equinoxes, which has hitherto received little explicit discussion. Comparing with other expressions in the literature, we confirm that the expression of Lee, Lisanti and Safdi is correct, while the expression of Lewin and Smith, the de facto standard expression, contains an error. For calculations of the absolute event rate, the leading order expression is sufficient while for modulation searches, an expression with the eccentricity is required for accurate predictions of the modulation phase.},

Rubin Observatory is a ground-based astronomical facility under construction, a joint project of the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Energy, designed to conduct a multipurpose 10 yr optical survey of the Southern Hemisphere sky: the Legacy Survey of Space and Time. Significant flexibility in survey strategy remains within the constraints imposed by the core science goals of probing dark energy and dark matter, cataloging the solar system, exploring the transient optical sky, and mapping the Milky Way. The survey’s massive data throughput will be transformational for many other astrophysics domains and Rubin’s data access policy sets the stage for a huge community of potential users. To ensure that the survey science potential is maximized while serving as broad a community as possible, Rubin Observatory has involved the scientific community at large in the process of setting and refining the details of the observing strategy. The motivation, history, and decision-making process of this strategy optimization are detailed in this paper, giving context to the science-driven proposals and recommendations for the survey strategy included in this Focus Issue.},

    "abstract": "The previous decade saw the discovery of the first four known interstellar objects due to advances in astronomical viewing equipment. Future sky surveys with greater sensitivity will allow for more frequent detections of such objects, including increasingly small objects. We consider the capabilities of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory to detect interstellar objects of small sizes during its period of operation over the next decade. We use LSST's detection capabilities and simulate populations of interstellar objects in the range of 1-50m in diameter to calculate the expected number of small interstellar objects that will be detected. We use previous detections of interstellar objects to calibrate our object density estimates. We also consider the impact of the population's albedo on detection rates by considering populations with two separate albedo distributions: a constant albedo of 0.06 and an albedo distribution that resembles near earth asteroids. We find that the number of detections increases with the diameter over the range of diameters we consider. We estimate a detection rate of up to a small ISO every two years of LSST's operation with an increase by a factor of ten for future surveys that extend a magnitude deeper.",

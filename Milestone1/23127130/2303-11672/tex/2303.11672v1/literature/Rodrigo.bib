	abstract = {The study of carbon and oxygen abundances yields information on the time evolution and nucleosynthetic origins of these elements, yet they remain relatively unexplored. At low metallicities, (12+log(O/H) {\textless} 8.0), nebular carbon measurements are limited to rest-frame UV collisionally excited emission lines. Therefore, we present the UV spectrophotometry of 12 nearby low-metallicity high-ionization H II regions in dwarf galaxies obtained using the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope. We present the ﬁrst analysis of the C/O ratio in local galaxies based solely on simultaneous signiﬁcant detections of the UV O+2 and C+2 collisionally excited lines in seven of our targets and ﬁve objects from the literatureto create a ﬁnal sample of 12 signiﬁcant detections. Our sample is complemented by optical SDSS spectra, from which we measured the nebular physical conditions and oxygen abundances using the direct method. At low metallicity, (12+log(O/H) {\textless} 8.0), no clear trend is evident in C/O versus O/H for the present sample given the large dispersion observed. When combined with recombination line observations at higher values of O/H, a general trend of increasing C/O with increasing O/H is also viable but with some signiﬁcant outliers. Additionally, we ﬁnd the C/N ratio appears to be constant (but with signiﬁcant scatter) over a large range in oxygen abundance, indicating thatcarbon is predominantly produced by similar nucleosynthetic mechanisms as nitrogen. If true, and our current understanding of nitrogen production is correct, this would indicate that primary production of carbon (a ﬂat trend) dominates at low metallicity, but quasisecondary production (an increasing trend) becomes prominent at higher metallicities. A larger sample will be needed to determine the true nature and dispersion of the relation.},

	abstract = {Methods. We combine frequency-dependent 2D dust continuum radiative transfer, kinetic gas-phase and UV photo-chemistry, ice formation, and detailed non-LTE heating \& cooling with the consistent calculation of the hydrostatic disk structure. We include Fe ii and CO ro-vibrational line heating/cooling relevant to the high-density gas close to the star, and apply a modiﬁed escapeprobability treatment. The models are characterised by a high degree of consistency between the various physical, chemical, and radiative processes, where the mutual feedbacks are solved iteratively.
Results. In application to a T Tauri disk extending from 0.5 AU to 500 AU, the models show that the dense, shielded and cold midplane (z/r {\textless}∼ 0.1, Tg ≈ Td) is surrounded by a layer of hot (Tg ≈ 5000 K) and thin (n H ≈ 10 7 to 10 8 cm−3) atomic gas that extends radially to about 10 AU and vertically up to z/r ≈ 0.5. This layer is predominantly heated by the stellar UV (e.g. PAH-heating) and cools via Fe ii semi-forbidden and Oi 630 nm optical line emission. The dust grains in this “halo” scatter the starlight back onto the disk, which aﬀects the photochemistry. The more distant regions are characterised by a cooler ﬂaring structure. Beyond r {\textgreater}∼ 100 AU, Tg decouples from Td even in the midplane and reaches values of about Tg ≈ 2Td.
Conclusions. Our models show that the gas energy balance is the key to understanding the vertical disk structure. Models calculated with the assumption Tg = Td show a much ﬂatter disk structure. The conditions in the close regions ({\textless}10 AU) with densities n H ≈ 10 8 to 10 15 cm−3 resemble those of cool stellar atmospheres and, thus, the heating and cooling is more like in stellar atmospheres. The application of heating and cooling rates known from PDR and interstellar cloud research alone can be misleading here, so more work needs to be invested to identify the leading heating and cooling processes.},

	abstract = {Methods. We use the recently developed disk code ProDiMo to calculate the physico-chemical structure of protoplanetary disks and apply the Monte-Carlo line radiative transfer code Ratran to predict observable line proﬁles and ﬂuxes. We consider a series of Herbig Ae type disk models ranging from 10−6 M to 2.2 × 10−2 M (between 0.5 and 700 AU) to discuss the dependency of the line ﬂuxes and ratios on disk mass for otherwise ﬁxed disk parameters. This paper prepares for a more thorough multi-parameter analysis related to the Herschel open time key program Gasps.
Results. We ﬁnd the [Cii] 157.7 μm line to originate in LTE from the surface layers of the disk, where Tg Td. The total emission is dominated by surface area and hence depends strongly on disk outer radius. The [Oi] lines can be very bright ({\textgreater}10−16 W/m2) and form in slightly deeper and closer regions under non-LTE conditions. For low-mass models, the [Oi] lines come preferentially from the central regions of the disk, and the peak separation widens. The high-excitation [Oi] 145.5 μm line, which has a larger critical density, decreases more rapidly with disk mass than the 63.2 μm line. Therefore, the [Oi] 63.2 μm/145.5 μm ratio is a promising disk mass indicator, especially as it is independent of disk outer radius for Rout {\textgreater} 200 AU. CO is abundant only in deeper layers AV {\textgreater}∼ 0.05. For too low disk masses (Mdisk {\textless}∼ 10−4 M ) the dust starts to become transparent, and CO is almost completely photo-dissociated. For masses larger than that the lines are an excellent independent tracer of disk outer radius and can break the outer radius degeneracy in the [Oi] 63.2 μm/[C ii]157.7 μm line ratio.
Conclusions. The far-IR ﬁne-structure lines of [Cii] and [Oi] observable with Herschel provide a promising tool to measure the disk gas mass, although they are mainly generated in the atomic surface layers. In spatially unresolved observations, none of these lines carry much information about the inner, possibly hot regions {\textless}30 AU.},

	abstract = {We study the hydrostatic density structure of the inner disc rim around Herbig Ae stars using the thermo-chemical hydrostatic code PRODIMO. We compare the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and images from our hydrostatic disc models to that from prescribed density structure discs. The 2D continuum radiative transfer in PRODIMO includes isotropic scattering. The dust temperature is set by the condition of radiative equilibrium. In the thermal-decoupled case, the gas temperature is governed by the balance between various heating and cooling processes. The gas and dust interact thermally via photoelectrons, radiatively, and via gas accommodation on grain surfaces. As a result, the gas is much hotter than in the thermo-coupled case, where the gas and dust temperatures are equal, reaching a few thousands K in the upper disc layers and making the inner rim higher. A physically motivated density drop at the inner radius (‘soft-edge’) results in rounded inner rims, which appear ring-like in near-infrared images. The combination of lower gravity pull and hot gas beyond ∼1 au results in a disc atmosphere that reaches a height over radius ratio z/r of 0.2, while this ratio is 0.1 only in the thermocoupled case. This puffed-up disc atmosphere intercepts larger amount of stellar radiation, which translates into enhanced continuum emission in the 3–30 μm wavelength region from hotter grains at ∼500 K. We also consider the effect of disc mass and grain size distribution on the SEDs self-consistently feeding those quantities back into the gas temperature, chemistry and hydrostatic equilibrium computation.},

	abstract = {The early evolution of protostellar disks with metallicities in the \$Z=1.0-0.01{\textasciitilde}Z\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ range was studied with a particular emphasis on the strength of gravitational instability and the nature of protostellar accretion in low-metallicity systems. Numerical hydrodynamics simulations in the thin-disk limit were employed that feature separate gas and dust temperatures, and disk mass-loading from the infalling parental cloud cores. Models with cloud cores of similar initial mass and rotation pattern, but distinct metallicity were considered to distinguish the effect of metallicity from that of initial conditions. The early stages of disk evolution in low-metallicity models are characterized by vigorous gravitational instability and fragmentation. Disk instability is sustained by continual mass-loading from the collapsing core. The time period that is covered by this unstable stage is much shorter in the \$Z=0.01{\textasciitilde}Z\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ models as compared to their higher metallicity counterparts thanks to the higher mass infall rates caused by higher gas temperatures (that decouple from lower dust temperatures) in the inner parts of collapsing cores. Protostellar accretion rates are highly variable in the low-metallicity models reflecting a highly dynamical nature of the corresponding protostellar disks. The low-metallicity systems feature short, but energetic episodes of mass accretion caused by infall of inward-migrating gaseous clumps that form via gravitational fragmentation of protostellar disks. These bursts seem to be more numerous and last longer in the \$Z=0.1{\textasciitilde}Z\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ models in comparison to the \$Z=0.01{\textasciitilde}Z\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ case. Variable protostellar accretion with episodic bursts is not a particular feature of solar metallicity disks. It is also inherent to gravitationally unstable disks with metallicities up to 100 times lower than solar.},

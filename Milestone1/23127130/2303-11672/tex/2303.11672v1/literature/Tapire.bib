title = {MAGNETO-THERMAL DISK WINDS FROM PROTOPLANETARY DISKS},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {The global evolution and dispersal of protoplanetary disks (PPDs) are governed by disk angular-momentum transport and mass-loss processes. Recent numerical studies suggest that angular-momentum transport in the inner region of PPDs is largely driven by magnetized disk wind, yet the wind mass-loss rate remains unconstrained. On the other hand, disk mass loss has conventionally been attributed to photoevaporation, where external heating on the disk surface drives a thermal wind. We unify the two scenarios by developing a one-dimensional model of magnetized disk winds with a simple treatment of thermodynamics as a proxy for external heating. The wind properties largely depend on (1) the magnetic field strength at the wind base, characterized by the poloidal Alfvén speed vAp, (2) the sound speed cs near the wind base, and (3) how rapidly poloidal field lines diverge (achieve  scaling). When , corotation is enforced near the wind base, resulting in centrifugal acceleration. Otherwise, the wind is accelerated mainly by the pressure of the toroidal magnetic field. In both cases, the dominant role played by magnetic forces likely yields wind outflow rates that exceed purely hydrodynamical mechanisms. For typical PPD accretion-rate and wind-launching conditions, we expect vAp to be comparable to cs at the wind base. The resulting wind is heavily loaded, with a total wind mass-loss rate likely reaching a considerable fraction of the wind-driven accretion rate. Implications for modeling global disk evolution and planet formation are also discussed.}

journal = {The Astrophysical Journal Letters},
abstract = {Understanding the origin of accretion and dispersal of protoplanetary disks is fundamental for investigating planet formation. Recent numerical simulations show that launching winds are unavoidable when disks undergo magnetically driven accretion and/or are exposed to external UV radiation. Observations also hint that disk winds are common. We explore how the resulting wind mass loss rate can be used as a probe of both disk accretion and dispersal. As a proof-of-concept study, we focus on magnetocentrifugal winds, magnetorotational instability turbulence, and external photoevapotaion. By developing a simple yet physically motivated disk model and coupling it with simulation results available in the literature, we compute the wind mass loss rate as a function of external UV flux for each mechanism. We find that different mechanisms lead to different levels of mass loss rate, indicating that the origin of disk accretion and dispersal can be determined, by observing the wind mass loss rate resulting from each mechanism. This determination provides important implications for planet formation. This work thus shows that the ongoing and future observations of the wind mass loss rate for protoplanetary disks are paramount to reliably constrain how protoplanetary disks evolve with time and how planet formation takes place in the disks.}

journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {It is still unclear whether the evolution of protoplanetary disks, a key ingredient in the theory of planet formation, is driven by viscous turbulence or magnetic disk winds. As viscously evolving disks expand outward over time, the evolution of disk sizes is a discriminant test for studying disk evolution. However, it is unclear how the observed disk size changes over time if disk evolution is driven by magnetic disk winds. Combining the thermo-chemical code DALI with the analytical wind-driven disk-evolution model presented in Tabone et al., we study the time evolution of the observed gas outer radius as measured from CO rotational emission (R CO,90\%). The evolution of R CO,90\% is driven by the evolution of the disk mass, as the physical radius stays constant over time. For a constant α  DW , an extension of the α Shakura–Sunyaev parameter to wind-driven accretion, R CO,90\% decreases linearly with time. Its initial size is set by the disk mass and the characteristic radius R c,0, but only R c,0 affects the evolution of R CO,90\%, with a larger R c,0 resulting in a steeper decrease of R CO,90\%. For a time-dependent α  DW , R CO,90\% stays approximately constant during most of the disk lifetime until R CO,90\% rapidly shrinks as the disk dissipates. The constant α  DW  models are able to reproduce the observed gas disk sizes in the ∼1–3 Myr old Lupus and ∼5–11 Myr old Upper Sco star-forming regions. However, they likely overpredict the gas disk size of younger (⪅0.7 Myr) disks.}

This observational result opened an avenue to test theoretical models and constrain the initial conditions of disk formation, fundamental in the understanding of the emergence of planetary systems. However, it is becoming clear that planet formation starts even before the Class II stage, in disks around Class 0 and I protostars. We show for the first time evidence for a correlation between the mass accretion rate and the disk mass for a large sample of Class I young stars located in nearby (&lt;500 pc) star-forming regions. We fit our sample, finding that the Class I object relation has a slope flatter than Class II stars, and the former have higher mass accretion rates and disk masses. The results are put in context of disk evolution models.}

The asteroseismic data of each star are taken by the Kepler or CoRoT space mission. It is found that the difference between the surface rotation rate and the average rotation rate (excluding the convective core) of most of stars is small enough to suggest that an efficient process of angular momentum transport operates during and/or before the main-sequence stage of stars. If each of the surface convective zone and the underlying radiative zone, for individual stars, is assumed to rotate uniformly, the difference in the rotation rate between the two zones turns out to be no more than a factor of 2 in most of the stars independently of their ages.}",

	abstract = {We present a large-scale study of stellar rotation for T Tauri stars in the Orion star-forming complex. We use the projected rotational velocity () estimations reported by the APOGEE-2 collaboration as well as individual masses and ages derived from the position of the stars in the HR diagram, considering Gaia-EDR3 parallaxes and photometry plus diverse evolutionary models. We find an empirical trend for decreasing with age for low-mass stars (0.4M ⊙ < M * < 1.2M ⊙). Our results support the existence of a mechanism linking to the presence of accreting protoplanetary disks, responsible for regulating stellar rotation on timescales of about 6 Myr, which is the timescale in which most of the T Tauri stars lose their inner disk. Our results provide important constraints to models of rotation in the early phases of evolution of young stars and their disks.}

	abstract = {We present a model for the rotational evolution of a young, solar-mass star interacting magnetically with an accretion disk. As in a previous paper (Paper I), the model includes changes in the star's mass and radius as it descends the Hayashi track, a decreasing accretion rate, and a prescription for the angular momentum transfer between the star and disk. Paper I concluded that, for the relatively strong magnetic coupling expected in real systems, additional processes are necessary to explain the existence of slowly rotating pre-main-sequence stars. In the present paper, we extend the stellar spin model to include the effect of a spin-down torque that arises from an accretion-powered stellar wind (APSW). For a range of magnetic field strengths, accretion rates, initial spin rates, and mass outflow rates, the modeled stars exhibit rotation periods within the range of 1–10 days in the age range of 1–3 Myr. This range coincides with the bulk of the observed rotation periods, with the slow rotators corresponding to stars with the lowest accretion rates, strongest magnetic fields, and/or highest stellar wind mass outflow rates. We also make a direct, quantitative comparison between the APSW scenario and the two types of disk-locking models (namely, the X-wind and Ghosh & Lamb type models) and identify some remaining theoretical issues for understanding young star spins.}

journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {We revisit the problem of low-mass pre-main-sequence stellar evolution and its observational consequences for where stars fall on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram (HRD). In contrast to most previous work, our models follow stars as they grow from small masses via accretion, and we perform a systematic study of how the stars’ HRD evolution is influenced by their initial radius, by the radiative properties of the accretion flow, and by the accretion history, using both simple idealized accretion histories and histories taken from numerical simulations of star cluster formation. We compare our numerical results to both non-accreting isochrones and to the positions of observed stars in the HRD, with a goal of determining whether both the absolute ages and the age dispersions inferred from non-accreting isochrones are reliable. We show that non-accreting isochrones can sometimes overestimate stellar ages for more massive stars (those with effective temperatures above ∼3500 K), thereby explaining why non-accreting isochrones often suggest a systematic age difference between more and less massive stars in the same cluster. However, we also find the only way to produce a similar overestimate for the ages of cooler stars is if these stars grow from ∼0.01 M☉ seed protostars that are an order of magnitude smaller than predicted by current theoretical models, and if the size of the seed protostar correlates systematically with the final stellar mass at the end of accretion. We therefore conclude that, unless both of these conditions are met, inferred ages and age spreads for cool stars are reliable, at least to the extent that the observed bolometric luminosities and temperatures are accurate. Finally, we note that the time dependence of the mass accretion rate has remarkably little effect on low-mass stars’ evolution on the HRD, and that such time dependence may be neglected for all stars except those with effective temperatures above ∼4000 K.}

I also find that photoevaporative clearing leaves a signature on the distribution of circumbinary disk lifetimes, with a sharp increase in disk lifetimes for binary separations a ≲ 0.3–1 AU. Observations of young binary stars can therefore be used to test models of disk evolution, and I show that current data set a strong upper limit to the rate of on-going photoevaporation (&lt;10−9 M☉ yr−1). Finally I discuss the implications of these results for planet formation and suggest that circumbinary planets around close (a ≲ 1 AU) binaries should be relatively common.}

journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {Disk winds are thought to play a critical role in star birth. As winds extract excess angular momentum from accretion disks, matter in the disk can be transported inward to the star to fuel mass growth. However, observational evidence of wind carrying angular momentum has been very limited. We present Submillimeter Array (SMA) observations of the young star MWC 349A in the H26α and H30α recombination lines. The high signal-to-noise ratios made possible by the maser emission process allow us to constrain the relative astrometry of the maser spots to milli-arcsecond precision. Previous observations of the H30α line with the SMA and the Plateau de Bure interferometer (PdBI) showed that masers are distributed in the disk and wind. Our new high-resolution observations of the H26α line reveal differences in spatial distribution from that of the H30α line. H26α line masers in the disk are excited in a thin annulus with a radius of about 25 au, while the H30α line masers are formed in a slightly larger annulus with a radius of 30 au. This is consistent with expectations for maser excitation in the presence of an electron density variation of approximately R−4. In addition, the H30α and H26α line masers arise from different parts in the wind. This difference is also expected from maser theory. The wind component of both masers exhibits line-of-sight velocities that closely follow a Keplerian law. This result provides strong evidence that the disk wind extracts significant angular momentum, thereby facilitating mass accretion in the young star.}

journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {The gas dissipation from a protoplanetary disk is one of the key processes affecting planet formation, and it is widely accepted that it happens on timescales of a few million years for disks around single stars. In recent years, several protoplanetary disks have been discovered in multiple-star systems, and despite the complex environment in which they find themselves, some of them seem to be quite old, a situation that may favor planet formation. A clear example of this is the disk around HD 98800 B, a binary in a hierarchical quadruple stellar system, which at an ∼10 Myr age seems to still be holding significant amounts of gas. Here we present a 1D+1D model to compute the vertical structure and gas evolution of circumbinary disks in hierarchical triple-star systems considering different stellar and disk parameters. We show that tidal torques due to the inner binary, together with the truncation of the disk due to the external companion, strongly reduce the viscous accretion and expansion of the disk. Even allowing viscous accretion by tidal streams, disks in these kind of environments can survive for more than 10 Myr, depending on their properties, with photoevaporation being the main gas dissipation mechanism. We particularly apply our model to the circumbinary disk around HD 98800 B and confirm that its longevity, along with the current nonexistence of a disk around the companion binary HD 98800 A, can be explained with our model and by this mechanism.}

abstract = {The past decade has seen a revolution in our understanding of protoplanetary disk evolution and planet formation in single-star systems. However, the majority of solar-type stars form in binary systems, so the impact of binary companions on protoplanetary disks is an important element in our understanding of planet formation. We have compiled a combined multiplicity/disk census of Taurus–Auriga, plus a restricted sample of close binaries in other regions, in order to explore the role of multiplicity in disk evolution. Our results imply that the tidal influence of a close (≲40 AU) binary companion significantly hastens the process of protoplanetary disk dispersal, as ∼2/3 of all close binaries promptly disperse their disks within ≲1 Myr after formation. However, prompt disk dispersal only occurs for a small fraction of wide binaries and single stars, with ∼80\%–90\% retaining their disks for at least ∼2–3 Myr (but rarely for more than ∼5 Myr). Our new constraints on the disk clearing timescale have significant implications for giant planet formation; most single stars have 3–5 Myr within which to form giant planets, whereas most close binary systems would have to form giant planets within ≲1 Myr. If core accretion is the primary mode for giant planet formation, then gas giants in close binaries should be rare. Conversely, since almost all single stars have a similar period of time within which to form gas giants, their relative rarity in radial velocity (RV) surveys indicates either that the giant planet formation timescale is very well matched to the disk dispersal timescale or that features beyond the disk lifetime set the likelihood of giant planet formation.}

    abstract = "{Most stars form and spend their early life in regions of enhanced stellar density. Therefore, the evolution of protoplanetary discs (PPDs) hosted by such stars are subject to the influence of other members of the cluster. Physically, PPDs might be truncated either by photoevaporation due to ultraviolet flux from massive stars, or tidal truncation due to close stellar encounters. Here we aim to compare the two effects in real cluster environments. In this vein we first review the properties of well-studied stellar clusters with a focus on stellar number density, which largely dictates the degree of tidal truncation, and far-ultraviolet (FUV) flux, which is indicative of the rate of external photoevaporation. We then review the theoretical PPD truncation radius due to an arbitrary encounter, additionally taking into account the role of eccentric encounters that play a role in hot clusters with a 1D velocity dispersion σv ≳ 2 km s−1. Our treatment is then applied statistically to varying local environments to establish a canonical threshold for the local stellar density (nc ≳ 104 pc−3) for which encounters can play a significant role in shaping the distribution of PPD radii over a time-scale ∼3 Myr. By combining theoretical mass-loss rates due to FUV flux with viscous spreading in a PPD, we establish a similar threshold for which a massive disc is completely destroyed by external photoevaporation. Comparing these thresholds in local clusters, we find that if either mechanism has a significant impact on the PPD population then photoevaporation is always the dominating influence.}",

journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {A protoplanetary disk (PPD) typically forms a dead zone near its midplane at a distance of a few astronomical units from the central protostar. Accretion through such a magnetically layered disk can be intrinsically unstable and has been associated with episodic outbursts in young stellar objects. We present the first investigation into the effects of a low-metallicity environment on the structure of the dead zone, as well as the resulting outbursting behavior of the PPD. We conducted global numerical hydrodynamic simulations of PPD formation and evolution in the thin-disk limit. The consequences of metallicity were considered via its effects on the gas and dust opacity of the disk, the thickness of the magnetically active surface layer, and the temperature of the prestellar cloud core. We show that the metal-poor disks accumulate much more mass in the innermost regions as compared to the solar-metallicity counterparts. The duration of the outbursting phase also varies with metallicity; the low-metallicity disks showed more powerful luminosity eruptions with a shorter burst phase, which was confined mostly to the early, embedded stages of the disk evolution. The lowest-metallicity disks with the higher cloud core temperature showed the most significant differences. The occurrence of outbursts was relatively rare in the disks around low-mass stars, and this was especially true at the lowest metallicities. We conclude that the metal content of the disk environment can have profound effects on both the disk structure and evolution in terms of episodic accretion.}

journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {Episodic accretion has been used to explain the wide range of protostellar luminosities, but its origin and influence on the star-forming process are not yet fully understood. We present an ALMA survey of N2H+ (1−0) and HCO+ (3−2) toward 39 Class 0 and Class I sources in the Perseus molecular cloud. N2H+ and HCO+ are destroyed via gas-phase reactions with CO and H2O, respectively, thus tracing the CO and H2O snowline locations. A snowline location at a much larger radius than that expected from the current luminosity suggests that an accretion burst has occurred in the past that has shifted the snowline outward. We identified 18/18 Class 0 and 9/10 Class I post-burst sources from N2H+ and 7/17 Class 0 and 1/8 Class I post-burst sources from HCO+. The accretion luminosities during the past bursts are found to be ∼10–100 L⊙. This result can be interpreted as either evolution of burst frequency or disk evolution. In the former case, assuming that refreeze-out timescales are 1000 yr for H2O and 10,000 yr for CO, we found that the intervals between bursts increase from 2400 yr in the Class 0 stage to 8000 yr in the Class I stage. This decrease in the burst frequency may reflect that fragmentation is more likely to occur at an earlier evolutionary stage when the young stellar object is more prone to instability.}

	abstract = {Early observations of T Tauri stars suggested that stars with evidence of circumstellar accretion disks rotated slower than stars without such evidence, but more recent results are not as clear. Near-IR circumstellar disk indicators, although the most widely available, are subject to uncertainties that can result from inner disk holes and/or the system inclination. Mid-infrared observations are less sensitive to such effects, but until now, these observations have been difficult to obtain. The Spitzer Space Telescope now easily enables mid-infrared measurements of large samples of PMS stars covering a broad mass range in nearby star-forming regions. Megeath and collaborators surveyed the Orion Molecular Clouds (~1 Myr) with the IRAC instrument (3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8 μm) as part of a joint IRAC and MIPS GTO program. We examine the relationship between rotation and Spitzer mid-IR fluxes for ~900 stars in Orion for stars between 3 and 0.1 M☉. We find in these Spitzer data the clearest indication to date that stars with longer periods are more likely than those with short periods to have IR excesses suggestive of disks.}

We have carried out I-band photometric monitoring within two fields, encompassing 153 confirmed or candidate members of the low-mass cluster population, from 0.02 to 0.5 M☉. We are sensitive to brightness changes on timescales from 10 minutes to two weeks with amplitudes as low as 0.004 mag, and find variability on these timescales in nearly 70~\% of cluster members. We identify both periodic and aperiodic modes of variability, as well as semi-periodic rapid fading events that are not accounted for by the standard explanations of rotational modulation of surface features or accretion. We have incorporated both optical and infrared color data to uncover trends in variability with mass and circumstellar disks. While the data confirm that the lowest-mass objects (M < 0.2 M☉) rotate more rapidly than the 0.2–0.5 M☉ members, they do not support a direct connection between rotation rate and the presence of a disk. Finally, we speculate on the origin of irregular variability in cluster members with no evidence for disks or accretion.}

Both thermal and X-ray ionization are considered. Previous investigations of layered discs used radial power-law models with isothermal vertical structure. But α models are used to model accretion, and the present work is a step towards a self-consistent treatment. The extent of the magnetically uncoupled (‘dead’) zone depends sensitively on α, on the assumed accretion rate and on the critical magnetic Reynolds number, below which magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence cannot be self-sustained. Its extent is extremely model-dependent. It is also shown that a tiny fraction of the cosmic abundance of metal atoms can dramatically affect the ionization balance. Gravitational instabilities are an unpromising source of transport, except in the early stages of disc formation.}",

abstract = {ALMA observations of protoplanetary disks acquired by the Disk Substructure at High Angular Resolution Project (DSHARP) resolve the dust and gas emission on angular scales as small as 3 astronomical units, offering an unprecedented detailed view of the environment where planets form. In this article, we present and discuss observations of the HD 163296 protoplanetary disk that imaged the 1.25 mm dust continuum and {\$}{\^{}}{\{}12{\}}{\$}CO J=2-1 rotational line emission at a spatial resolution of 4 and 10 au, respectively. The continuum observations resolve and allow us to characterize the previously discovered dust rings at radii of 67 and 100 au. They also reveal new small scale structures, such as a dark gap at 10 au, a bright ring at 15 au, a dust crescent at a radius of 55 au, and several fainter azimuthal asymmetries. The observations of the CO and dust emission inform about the vertical structure of the disk and allow us to directly constrain the dust extinction optical depth at the dust rings. Furthermore, the observed asymmetries in the dust continuum emission corroborate to the hypothesis that the complex structure of the HD 163296 disk is the result of the gravitational interaction with yet unseen planets.},

abstract = {The strength and structure of the large-scale magnetic field in protoplanetary discs are still unknown, although they could have important consequences for the dynamics and evolution of the disc. Using a mean-field approach in which we model the effects of turbulence through enhanced diffusion coefficients, we study the time-evolution of the large-scale poloidal magnetic field in a global model of a thin accretion disc, with particular attention to protoplanetary discs. With the transport coefficients usually assumed, the magnetic field strength does not significantly increase radially inwards, leading to a relatively weak magnetic field in the inner part of the disc. We show that with more realistic transport coefficients that take into account the vertical structure of the disc and the back-reaction of the magnetic field on the flow as obtained by Guilet {\&} Ogilvie (2012), the magnetic field can significantly increase radially inwards. The magnetic-field profile adjusts to reach an equilibrium value of the plasma {\$}\backslashbeta{\$} parameter (the ratio of midplane thermal pressure to magnetic pressure) in the inner part of the disc. This value of {\$}\backslashbeta{\$} depends strongly on the aspect ratio of the disc and on the turbulent magnetic Prandtl number, and lies in the range {\$}10{\^{}}4-10{\^{}}7{\$} for protoplanetary discs. Such a magnetic field is expected to affect significantly the dynamics of protoplanetary discs by increasing the strength of MHD turbulence and launching an outflow. We discuss the implications of our results for the evolution of protoplanetary discs and for the formation of powerful jets as observed in T-Tauri star systems.},

We show that viscosities parameterized in the usual way with {\$}\backslashalpha \backslashgtrsim 10{\^{}}{\{}-4{\}}{\$}, comparable to values suggested for hydrodynamic turbulence, can explain the observed accretion rates and lifetimes with plausible inner disc surface densities. Our models are also in better agreement with surface density estimates of the minimum mass solar nebula than models with rapid transport for a given mass accretion rate, such as recent models of accretion driven by magnetic winds. The required surface densities are a natural result of the protostellar infall phase, as long as non-gravitational transport is limited. We argue that, in addition to possible non-ideal magnetic transport due to disc winds possibly modified by the Hall effect, the effects of low-viscosity hydrodynamic accretion deserve more consideration.},

@article{Bai2014,
abstract = {The gas dynamics of protoplanetary disks (PPDs) is largely controlled by non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects including Ohmic resistivity, the Hall effect and ambipolar diffusion. Among these the role of the Hall effect is the least explored and most poorly understood. We have included all three non-ideal MHD effects in a self-consistent manner to investigate the role of the Hall effect on PPD gas dynamics using local shearing-box simulations. In this first paper, we focus on the inner region of PPDs, where previous studies excluding the Hall effect have revealed that the inner disk up to {\~{}}10 AU is largely laminar, with accretion driven by a magnetocentrifugal wind. We confirm this basic picture and show that the Hall effect introduces modest modifications to the wind solutions, depending on the polarity of the large-scale poloidal magnetic field B{\_}0 threading the disk. When B{\_}0.Omega{\textgreater}0, the horizontal magnetic field is strongly amplified toward the disk interior, leading to a stronger disk wind (by {\~{}}50{\%} or less in terms of the wind-driven accretion rate). The enhanced horizontal field also leads to much stronger large-scale Maxwell stress (magnetic braking) that contributes to a considerable fraction of the wind-driven accretion rate. When B{\_}0.Omega{\textless}0, the horizontal magnetic field is reduced, leading to a weaker disk wind (by {\~{}}20{\%}) and negligible magnetic braking. Moreover, we find that when B{\_}0.Omega{\textgreater}0, the laminar region extends farther to {\~{}}15 AU before the magneto-rotational instability sets in, while for B{\_}0.Omega{\textless}0, the laminar region extends only to {\~{}}3-5 AU for a typical PPD accretion rates. Scaling relations for the wind properties, especially the wind-driven accretion rate, are provided for aligned and anti-aligned field geometries. Issues with the symmetry of the wind solutions and grain abundance are also discussed.},

abstract = {A rotating star has initially a purely poloidal magnetic field. Meridional circulation of matter causes non-uniform rotation, which in turn generates a toroidal component of field and so a toroidal magnetic force. The possible steady states are studied; it is shown that if the circulation speed is less than the local Alfv{\'{e}}n speed (defined by the poloidal field), then flow along a field line parallel to the surface will cause a steady increase of angular velocity towards the equator. Consider a rotating star, with a poloidal magnetic field symmetrical about the axis of rotation. In a steady state, without meridional circulation of matter, the angular velocity is very nearly uniform along a line of force (1). Now let there be a maintained meridional circulation of matter. The convection of angular momentum causes a strong variation of angular velocity along a line of force, and so generates a toroidal field. The resulting toroidal force changes the angular momentum of circulating elements. Further, the change in the toroidal field at any point depends not only on the non-uniform rotation along the poloidal field, but also on the convection of the toroidal field by the circulation. We now suppose that a steady state has been reached, and look for the distribution of angular velocity and toroidal field strength. We write the magnetic and velocity fields H = H p + H {\'{i}} , (i) V = V 3{\textgreater} + V ¿ = V J3 + c{\'{o}}{\'{i}}{\'{i}}t, (2) where the suffices p and t refer respectively to poloidal and toroidal components, the unit vector t is in the positive toroidal direction, Q is the angular velocity, and ci) is the perpendicular distance from the axis.

We present a strong conservation form for the equations of radiation hydrodynamics for studying nonlinear pulsations of stars. However, the modification we propose is of general mathematical nature. We study a differential geometrically consistent artificial viscosity analytically and visualize a comparison of our approach to previous implementations by applying it to a simple self-similar velocity field which has a direct application in stars as the fundamental mode of pulsation is radial. We first give a general introduction to artificial viscosity and motivate its application in numerical computations. We then show how a tensor of artificial viscosity has to be designed when going beyond common static Eulerian or Lagrangian comoving rectangular grids. We derive and state the modified equations which include metrical terms that adjust the isotropic (pressure) part of the tensor of artificial viscosity.},

abstract = {We introduce the Disk Substructures at High Angular Resolution Project (DSHARP), one of the initial Large Programs conducted with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The primary goal of DSHARP is to find and characterize substructures in the spatial distributions of solid particles for a sample of 20 nearby protoplanetary disks, using very high resolution (0.035 arcsec, or 5 au FWHM) observations of their 240 GHz (1.25 mm) continuum emission. These data provide a first homogeneous look at the small-scale features in disks that are directly relevant to the planet formation process, quantifying their prevalence, morphologies, spatial scales, spacings, symmetry, and amplitudes, for targets with a variety of disk and stellar host properties. We find that these substructures are ubiquitous in this sample of large, bright disks. They are most frequently manifested as concentric, narrow emission rings and depleted gaps, although large-scale spiral patterns and small arc-shaped azimuthal asymmetries are also present in some cases. These substructures are found at a wide range of disk radii (from a few au to more than 100 au), are usually compact ({\$}{\textless}{\$}10 au), and show a wide range of amplitudes (brightness contrasts). Here we discuss the motivation for the project, describe the survey design and the sample properties, detail the observations and data calibration, highlight some basic results, and provide a general overview of the key conclusions that are presented in more detail in a series of accompanying articles. The DSHARP data -- including visibilities, images, calibration scripts, and more -- are released for community use at https://almascience.org/alma-data/lp/DSHARP.},

abstract = {Equilibrium models of accretion discs containing magnetic fields are constructed. The model system consists of a perfectly conducting, non-self-gravitating fluid in differential rotation about a massive central object. The fluid contains a purely poloidal magnetic field which bends as it passes through the disc, enforcing isorotation on magnetic surfaces. The general problem of constructing an equilibrium is first defined. Two methods are then used to obtain special solutions which require only the solution of ordinary differential equations. First, the asymptotic solutions for thin discs are derived. Two families of solutions are found: 'weakly magnetized' discs, in which gravitational, pressure and magnetic forces all contribute to the vertical equilibrium, and 'strongly magnetized' discs, in which the dominant vertical balance is between pressure and magnetic forces only. In the former case, the angular velocity deviates from the Keplerian value by an asymptotically small quantity, while the deviation is of order unity in the latter. Secondly, solutions are found by assuming self-similarity in the spherical radial coordinate, but without requiring the equilibria to be thin. Finally, the possibility of converting an equilibrium into a model of a self-consistent, wind-driven accretion disc is investigated, by including Ohmic resistivity, a meridional accretion flow and a toroidal magnetic field. In addition to being of intrinsic interest, the equilibria constructed here may be used as models for more realistic stability analyses than have been made previously. {\textcopyright} 1997 RAS.},

abstract = {Context. Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence plays a crucial role in the dust dynamics of protoplanetary discs. It affects planet formation, vertical settling, and is one possible origin of the large scale axisymmetric structures, such as rings, recently imaged by ALMA and SPHERE. Among the variety of MHD processes in discs, the magnetorotational instability (MRI) has raised particular interest since it provides a source of turbulence and potentially organizes the flow into large scale structures. However, the weak ionization of discs prevents the MRI from being excited beyond 1 AU. Moreover, the low velocity dispersion observed in CO and strong sedimentation of millimetre dust measured in T-Tauri discs are in contradiction with predictions based on ideal MRI turbulence. Aims. In this paper, we study the effects of non-ideal MHD and magnetized winds on the dynamics and sedimentation of dust grains. We consider a weakly ionized plasma subject to ambipolar diffusion characterizing the disc outer regions (1 AU). Methods. To compute the dust and gas motions, we performed numerical MHD simulations in the stratified shearing box, using a modified version of the PLUTO code. We explored different grain sizes from micrometre to few centimetres and different disc vertical magnetizations with plasma beta ranging from 10 3 to 10 5. Results. Our simulations show that the mm-cm dust is contained vertically in a very thin layer, with typical heightscale 0.4 AU at R = 30 AU, compatible with recent ALMA observations. Horizontally, the grains are trapped within the pressure maxima (or zonal flows) induced by ambipolar diffusion, leading to the formation of dust rings. For micrometre grains and strong magnetization, we find that the dust layer has a size comparable to the disc heightscale H. In this regime, dust settling cannot be explained by a simple 1D diffusion theory but results from a large scale 2D circulation induced by both MHD winds and zonal flows. Conclusions. Our results suggest that non-ideal MHD effects and MHD winds associated with zonal flows play a major role in shaping the radial and vertical distribution of dust in protoplanetary discs. Leading to effective accretion efficiency $\alpha$ 10 −3-10 −1 , non-ideal MHD models are also a promising avenue to reconcile the low turbulent activity measured in discs with their relatively high accretion rates.},

abstract = {We perform local, vertically stratified shearing-box MHD simulations of protoplanetary disks (PPDs) at a fiducial radius of 1 AU that take into account the effects of both Ohmic resistivity and ambipolar diffusion (AD). The magnetic diffusion coefficients are evaluated self-consistently from a look-up table based on equilibrium chemistry. We first show that the inclusion of AD dramatically changes the conventional picture of layered accretion. Without net vertical magnetic field, the system evolves into a toroidal field dominated configuration with extremely weak turbulence in the far-UV ionization layer that is far too inefficient to drive rapid accretion. In the presence of a weak net vertical field (plasma beta{\~{}}10{\^{}}5 at midplane), we find that the MRI is completely suppressed, resulting in a fully laminar flow throughout the vertical extent of the disk. A strong magnetocentrifugal wind is launched that efficiently carries away disk angular momentum and easily accounts for the observed accretion rate in PPDs. Moreover, under a physical disk wind geometry, all the accretion flow proceeds through a strong current layer with thickness of {\~{}}0.3H that is offset from disk midplane with radial velocity of up to 0.4 times the sound speed. Both Ohmic resistivity and AD are essential for the suppression of the MRI and wind launching. The efficiency of wind transport increases with increasing net vertical magnetic flux and the penetration depth of the FUV ionization. Our laminar wind solution has important implications on planet formation and global evolution of PPDs.},

abstract = {Accretion disks are likely threaded by external vertical magnetic flux, which enhances the level of turbulence via the magnetorotational instability (MRI). Using shearing-box simulations, we find that such external magnetic flux also strongly enhances the amplitude of banded radial density variations known as zonal flows. Moreover, we report that vertical magnetic flux is strongly concentrated toward low-density regions of the zonal flow. Mean vertical magnetic field can be more than doubled in low-density regions, and reduced to nearly zero in high density regions in some cases. In ideal MHD, the scale on which magnetic flux concentrates can reach a few disk scale heights. In the non-ideal MHD regime with strong ambipolar diffusion, magnetic flux is concentrated into thin axisymmetric shells at some enhanced level, whose size is typically less than half a scale height. We show that magnetic flux concentration is closely related to the fact that the magnetic diffusivity of the MRI turbulence is anisotropic. In addition to a conventional Ohmic-like turbulent resistivity, we find that there is a correlation between the vertical velocity and horizontal magnetic field fluctuations that produces a mean electric field that acts to anti-diffuse the vertical magnetic flux. The anisotropic turbulent diffusivity has analogies to the Hall effect, and may have important implications for magnetic flux transport in accretion disks. The physical origin of magnetic flux concentration may be related to the development of channel flows followed by magnetic reconnection, which acts to decrease the mass-to-flux ratio in localized regions. The association of enhanced zonal flows with magnetic flux concentration may lead to global pressure bumps in protoplanetary disks that helps trap dust particles and facilitates planet formation.},

abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of new ALMA observations of the disk around the T-Tauri star HD 143006, which at 46 mas (7.6 au) resolution reveal new substructures in the 1.25 mm continuum emission. The disk resolves into a series of concentric rings and gaps together with a bright arc exterior to the rings that resembles hydrodynamics simulations of a vortex, and a bridge-like feature connecting the two innermost rings. Although our {\$}{\^{}}{\{}12{\}}{\$}CO observations at similar spatial resolution do not show obvious substructure, they reveal an inner disk depleted of CO emission. From the continuum emission and the CO velocity field we find that the innermost ring has a higher inclination than the outermost rings and the arc.

We compare the observed substructures in the ALMA observations with recent scattered light data from VLT/SPHERE of this object. In particular, the location of narrow shadow lanes in the SPHERE image combined with pressure scale height estimates, favor a large misalignment of about {\$}41{\^{}}{\{}\backslashcirc{\}}{\$}.

abstract = {Global evolution and dispersal of protoplanetary disks (PPDs) is governed by disk angular momentum transport and mass-loss processes. Recent numerical studies suggest that angular momentum transport in the inner region of PPDs is largely driven by magnetized disk wind, yet the wind mass-loss rate remains unconstrained. On the other hand, disk mass loss has conventionally been attributed to photoevaporation, where external heating on the disk surface drives a thermal wind. We unify the two scenarios by developing a 1D model of magnetized disk winds with a simple treatment of thermodynamics as a proxy for external heating. The wind properties largely depend on 1) the magnetic field strength at the wind base, characterized by the poloidal Alfv$\backslash$'en speed {\$}v{\_}{\{}Ap{\}}{\$}, 2) the sound speed {\$}c{\_}s{\$} near the wind base, and 3) how rapidly poloidal field lines diverge (achieve {\$}R{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}{\$} scaling). When {\$}v{\_}{\{}Ap{\}}\backslashgg c{\_}s{\$}, corotation is enforced near the wind base, resulting in centrifugal acceleration. Otherwise, the wind is accelerated mainly by the pressure of the toroidal magnetic field. In both cases, the dominant role played by magnetic forces likely yields wind outflow rates that well exceed purely hydrodynamical mechanisms. For typical PPD accretion-rate and wind-launching conditions, we expect {\$}v{\_}{\{}Ap{\}}{\$} to be comparable to {\$}c{\_}s{\$} at the wind base. The resulting wind is heavily loaded, with total wind mass loss rate likely reaching a considerable fraction of wind-driven accretion rate. Implications for modeling global disk evolution and planet formation are also discussed.},

abstract = {The evolution of a large-scale poloidal magnetic field in accretion discs is an important problem because of its role in the launching of jets and winds and in determining the intensity of turbulence. In this paper, we develop a formalism to calculate the transport magnetic flux in a thin accretion disc, thus determining its evolution on a viscous/resistive timescale. The governing equations are derived by performing an asymptotic expansion in the limit of a thin disc, in the regime where the magnetic field is dominated by its vertical component. Turbulent viscosity and resistivity are included, with an arbitrary vertical profile that can be adjusted to mimic the vertical structure of the turbulence. At a given radius and time, the rates of transport of mass and magnetic flux are determined by a one-dimensional problem in the vertical direction, in which the radial gradients of various quantities appear as source terms. We solve this problem to obtain the transport rates and the vertical structure of the disc. The present paper is then restricted to the idealised case of uniform diffusion coefficients, while a companion paper will study more realistic vertical profiles of these coefficients. We show the advection of weak magnetic fields to be significantly faster than the advection of mass, contrary to what a crude vertical averaging might suggest. This results from the larger radial velocities away from the mid-plane, which barely affect the mass accretion owing to the low density in these regions but do affect the advection of magnetic flux. Possible consequences of this larger accretion velocity include a potentially interesting time-dependence with the magnetic flux distribution evolving faster than the mass distribution. If the disc is not too thin, this fast advection may also partially solve the long-standing problem of too efficient diffusion of an inclined magnetic field.},

    abstract = { Protoplanetary disks are quasi-steady structures whose evolution and dispersal determine the environment for planet formation. I review the theory of protoplanetary disk evolution and its connection to observations. Substantial progress has been made in elucidating the physics of potential angular momentum transport processes—including self-gravity, magnetorotational instability, baroclinic instabilities, and magnetic braking—and in developing testable models for disk dispersal via photoevaporation. The relative importance of these processes depends upon the initial mass, size, and magnetization of the disk, and subsequently on its opacity, ionization state, and external irradiation. Disk dynamics is therefore coupled to star formation, pre-main-sequence stellar evolution, and dust coagulation during the early stages of planet formation and may vary dramatically from star to star. The importance of validating theoretical models is emphasized, with the key observations being those that probe disk structure on the scales between 1 AU and 10 AU, where theory is most uncertain. }

	abstract = {We calculate the abundances of electrons and ions in the hot (≳500 K), dusty parts of protoplanetary disks, treating for the first time the effects of thermionic and ion emission from the dust grains. High-temperature ionization modeling has involved simply assuming that alkali elements such as potassium occur as gas-phase atoms and are collisionally ionized following the Saha equation. We show that the Saha equation often does not hold, because free charges are produced by thermionic and ion emission and destroyed when they stick to grain surfaces. This means the ionization state depends not on the first ionization potential of the alkali atoms, but rather on the grains’ work functions. The charged species’ abundances typically rise abruptly above about 800 K, with little qualitative dependence on the work function, gas density, or dust-to-gas mass ratio. Applying our results, we find that protoplanetary disks’ dead zone, where high diffusivities stifle magnetorotational turbulence, has its inner edge located where the temperature exceeds a threshold value ≈1000 K. The threshold is set by ambipolar diffusion except at the highest densities, where it is set by Ohmic resistivity. We find that the disk gas can be diffusively loaded onto the stellar magnetosphere at temperatures below a similar threshold. We investigate whether the “short-circuit” instability of current sheets can operate in disks and find that it cannot, or works only in a narrow range of conditions; it appears not to be the chondrule formation mechanism. We also suggest that thermionic emission is important for determining the rate of Ohmic heating in hot Jupiters.}

    abstract = { ▪ Abstract We summarize the properties of FU Orionis variables, and show how accretion disk models simply explain many peculiarities of these objects. FU Ori systems demonstrate that disk accretion in early stellar evolution is highly episodic, varying from ∼ 10−7 yr−1 in the low (T Tauri) state to 10−4 yr−1 in the high (FU Ori) state. This variability in mass accretion is matched by a corresponding variability in mass ejection, with mass loss rates reaching ∼ 10−1 of the mass accretion rates in outburst. It appears that the FU Ori phenomenon is restricted to early phases of stellar evolution, probably with infall still occuring to the disk, which may help drive repetitive outbursts. Thermal instabilities are a promising way to produce FU Ori disk outbursts, although many uncertainties remain in the theory; triggering by interactions with companion stars on eccentric orbits may also play a role. }

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {We have conducted a long-term, wide-field, high-cadence photometric monitoring survey of ∼50,000 stars in the Lagoon Nebula H ii region. This first paper presents rotation periods for 290 low-mass stars in NGC 6530, the young cluster illuminating the nebula, and for which we assemble a catalog of infrared and spectroscopic disk indicators, estimated masses and ages, and X-ray luminosities. The distribution of rotation periods we measure is broadly uniform for 0.5 days < P < 10 days; the short-period cutoff corresponds to breakup. We observe no obvious bimodality in the period distribution, but we do find that stars with disk signatures rotate more slowly on average. The stars' X-ray luminosities are roughly flat with rotation period, at the saturation level (log LX/Lbol ≈ −3.3). However, we find a significant positive correlation between LX/Lbol and corotation radius, suggesting that the observed X-ray luminosities are regulated by centrifugal stripping of the stellar coronae. The period–mass relationship in NGC 6530 is broadly similar to that of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), but the slope of the relationship among the slowest rotators differs from that in the ONC and other young clusters. We show that the slope of the period–mass relationship for the slowest rotators can be used as a proxy for the age of a young cluster, and we argue that NGC 6530 may be slightly younger than the ONC, making it a particularly important touchstone for models of angular momentum evolution in young, low-mass stars.}

The accretion in these trapped states can be steady or cyclic; we explore these states over a wide range of parameter space. We find two distinct regions of instability: one related to the buildup and release of mass in the disc outside corotation, and the other to mass storage within the transition region near corotation. With a set of calculations over long time-scales, we show how trapped states evolve from both non-accreting and fully accreting initial conditions, and also calculate the effects of cyclic accretion on the spin evolution of the star. Observations of cycles such as found here would provide important clues on the physics of magnetospheric accretion. Recent observations of cyclic and other unusual variability in T Tauri stars (EXors) and X-ray binaries are discussed in this context.}",

  title="{The Burst Mode of Accretion and Disk Fragmentation in the Early Embedded Stages of Star Formation}",

  abstract={We revisit our original papers on the burst mode of accretion by incorporating a detailed energy balance equation into a thin-disk model for the formation and evolution of circumstellar disks around low-mass protostars. Our model includes the effect of radiative cooling, viscous and shock heating, and heating due to stellar and background irradiation. Following the collapse from the prestellar phase allows us to model the early embedded phase of disk formation and evolution. During this time, the disk is susceptible to fragmentation, depending upon the properties of the initial prestellar core. Globally, we find that higher initial core angular momentum and mass content favors more fragmentation, but higher levels of background radiation can moderate the tendency to fragment. A higher rate of mass infall onto the disk than that onto the star is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for disk fragmentation. More locally, both the Toomre Q -parameter needs to be below a critical value and the local cooling time needs to be shorter than a few times the local dynamical time. Fragments that form during the early embedded phase tend to be driven into the inner disk regions and likely trigger mass accretion and luminosity bursts that are similar in magnitude to FU-Orionis-type or EX-Lupi-like events. Disk accretion is shown to be an intrinsically variable process, thanks to disk fragmentation, nonaxisymmetric structure, and the effect of gravitational torques. The additional effect of a generic α-type viscosity acts to reduce burst frequency and accretion variability, and is likely to not be viable for values of α significantly greater than 0.01.}

Important changes in the dynamos operating in these stars may result from this evolution, which should be observable in their surface magnetic fields. Here we present a study aimed at observing the evolution of these magnetic fields through this critical time period. We observed stars in open clusters and stellar associations of known ages, and used Zeeman Doppler imaging to characterize their complex magnetic large-scale fields. Presented here are results for 15 stars, from five associations, with ages from 20 to 250 Myr, masses from 0.7 to 1.2 M⊙, and rotation periods from 0.4 to 6 d. We find complex large-scale magnetic field geometries, with global average strengths from 14 to 140 G. There is a clear trend towards decreasing average large-scale magnetic field strength with age, and a tight correlation between magnetic field strength and Rossby number. Comparing the magnetic properties of our zero-age main-sequence sample to those of both younger and older stars, it appears that the magnetic evolution of solar-type stars during the pre-main sequence is primarily driven by structural changes, while it closely follows the stars’ rotational evolution on the main sequence.}",

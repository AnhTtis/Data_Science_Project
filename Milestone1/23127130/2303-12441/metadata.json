    "abstract": "We present a path loss model that accurately predicts the path loss with low computational complexity considering environmental factors. In the proposed model, the entire area under consideration is recognized and divided into regions from a raster map, and each type of region is assigned with a path loss exponent (PLE) value. We then extract the model parameters via measurement in a suburban area to verify the proposed model. The results show that the root mean square error (RMSE) of the proposed model is 1.4 dB smaller than the widely used log-distance model.",

We have presented NOPE, an approach to estimate the pose of novel objects from a single image. Our experiments have shown that direct inference of view embeddings from a single view allows for accurate object pose estimation, even for objects from unseen categories, while requiring neither retraining nor a 3D model. Furthermore, we have evidenced that the template matching approach we follow lets us estimate the pose ambiguities that arise for many objects.

\caption{\nguyen{{\bf View Synthesis vs Pose Estimation.} While there is a connection between view synthesis and 3D pose estimation, there is no direct correlation between them. In fact, despite 3DiM \cite{3dim} producing better overall view synthesis in pixel level, it demonstrates lower performance in 3D object pose estimation compared to our method when used for this task. }
\vincentrmk{I dont understand what are the images and what you want to show here.  
What I understand is that the images for our method are generated using stable diffusion from our predicted embeddings, but what does it show?
}
}\nguyenrmk{Sorry, let's remove this figure, it's not helpful. What I want to show with this figure is that there is no correlation between view synthesis in pixel space and  3D pose estimation template matching. Indeed, through our experiments, we found that 3DiM always have good results on view synthesis in pixel space but not very good in pose estimation. This observation motivates us to skip view synthesis in pixel space but focus on feature space since we can use discriminate features which is proven in \cite{nguyen_templates_2022} more helpful for 3d object pose estimation}

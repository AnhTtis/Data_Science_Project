Our experiments have shown that direct inference of average view embeddings from a single view, as in NOPE, leads to accurate object pose estimation. This is true even for objects from unseen categories, while requiring neither retraining nor a 3D model. NOPE also lets us estimate the pose ambiguities that arise for many objects.

%Another very interesting property of the template matching approach we follow is that we can estimate the pose ambiguities that arise for many objects.

    "abstract": "In 2003, Klainerman and Nicolò \\cite{Kl-Ni} proved the stability of Minkowski in the case of the exterior of an outgoing null cone. Relying on the method used in \\cite{Kl-Ni}, Caciotta and Nicolò \\cite{Ca-Ni} proved the stability of Kerr spacetime in external regions, i.e. outside an outgoing null cone far away from the Kerr event horizon. In this paper, we give a new proof of \\cite{Ca-Ni}. Compared to \\cite{Ca-Ni}, we reduce the number of derivatives needed in the proof, simplify the treatment of the last slice, and provide a unified treatment of the decay of initial data which contains in particular the initial data considered by Klainerman and Szeftel in \\cite{KS:main}. Also, concerning the treatment of curvature estimates, similar to \\cite{ShenMink}, we replace the vectorfield method used in \\cite{Kl-Ni,Ca-Ni} by $r^p$-weighted estimates introduced by Dafermos and Rodnianski in \\cite{Da-Ro}.",

    "abstract": "We present predictions for the cross sections of the coherent and incoherent $J/ψ$ photoproduction in ultra-peripheral collisions at RHIC and at the LHC calculated for different classes of events depending on the presence of neutrons emitted by colliding nuclei. Since strong nucleus-nucleus interactions in UPCs are suppressed, it is usually assumed that neutrons at forward rapidities originate mainly from the electromagnetic dissociation of colliding nuclei caused by additional photon exchanges. This is a reasonable assumption for the coherent photoproduction where the state of the target nucleus remains intact. We consider additional sources of neutrons in the incoherent quasielastic and nucleon dissociative $J/ψ$ photoproduction and show that these processes significantly change probabilities of neutron emission compared to calculations when only neutrons from electromagnetic dissociation of nuclei are considered. Such studies should allow one to explore the dynamics of nuclear shadowing in the incoherent $J/ψ$ photoproduction down to $x \\sim 10^{-5}$.",

    "abstract": "Reducing energy consumption - and especially carbon emissions - is one of the most important challenges facing humankind. ICT (Information and Communication Technology) is a powerful tool to reduce emissions as it offers alternatives to activities that are costly in energy: video streaming saves energy vs driving to a movie theater, for instance. Still, the carbon footprint of ICT in general and networking in particular have been growing, despite better energy efficiency per transmitted bit, due to the sheer growth in Internet usage and traffic.\n  The information and communication technology (ICT) sector is currently estimated to create 2.7% of all global CO2 emissions and expected to continue to increase. Hence, monitoring and reducing the CO2 emissions from ICT is increasingly important. Networks are responsible for around 13% of ICT energy consumption, a third of which in turn is attributable to backbone (core) networks. As such, it is important to offer new mechanisms to reduce the energy footprint of networks.\n  In this paper, we present a framework to include energy considerations (as a proxy for carbon footprint) into the management plane of a network. We apply this framework to optimize the network topology so as to minimize the energy spending while at the same time providing a satisfactory Quality of Experience (QoE) to the end users. We present this framework along high-level considerations, as its deployment and evaluation is left for future work.",

  abstract = {Bayesian quadrature optimization (BQO) maximizes the expectation of an expensive black-box integrand taken over a known probability distribution. In this work, we study BQO under distributional uncertainty in which the underlying probability distribution is unknown except for a limited set of its i.i.d samples. A standard BQO approach maximizes the Monte Carlo estimate of the true expected objective given the fixed sample set. Though Monte Carlo estimate is unbiased, it has high variance given a small set of samples; thus can result in a spurious objective function. We adopt the distributionally robust optimization perspective to this problem by maximizing the expected objective under the most adversarial distribution. In particular, we propose a novel posterior sampling based algorithm, namely distributionally robust BQO (DRBQO) for this purpose. We demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of our proposed framework in synthetic and real-world problems, and characterize its theoretical convergence via Bayesian regret.},

@phdthesis{VariationalBasedGlobalNoii2021,
  abstract = {Fracture mechanics is generally aimed at investigating material failure by describing the nucleation and propagation of the cracks in a solid body due to the deformation process. An example of these approaches is the variational-based model of fracture by Francfort and Marigo as well as the related regularised formulation, commonly referred to as variational phase-field formulation of brittle fracture. This formulation leads to novel simulation tool for efficiently describing the complicated fracture phenomena for industrial applications. This work is aimed at investigating the adoption of Global-Local approaches while modelling fracture using the phase-field framework. The proposed framework for the Global-Local approach is first used to address small deformation. Two different types of the Global-Local formulation are proposed: one equipped with DirichletNeumann-type boundary conditions (g/l − 1), and one using Robin-type boundary conditions (g/l − 2). The first type is strongly non-intrusive, which enables computations performed with legacy codes with less implementation effort. We investigate the convergence performance when the native Global-Local algorithm is used, and show that the obtained results are identical to the reference phase-field solution. We also equip the Global-Local solution update procedure with relaxation/acceleration techniques, such as Aitken's ∆2-method, the Symmetric Rank One and Broyden's methods and show that the iterative convergence can be improved significantly. The second type, namely g/l − 2, has the advantage of computational efficiency. In contrast to the Dirichlet boundary conditions being used in g/l − 1 within the local level, this does not lead to a stiff local response, particularly in a softening regime, and thus does not require any ''extra efforts'' such as relaxation/acceleration procedures. The efficient Global-Local formulation is further extended towards large deformations. Finally, to cope with different finite element discretization at the interface between the global and local domains, the Global-Local formulation is further extended to non-conformal discretizations. The main advantage is to achieve more regularity at the interface. For this purpose, the mortar method, the dual mortar method, and localized mortar method are adopted. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed model, several numerical examples are performed.},

The main differences and similarities of these approaches are then highlighted from an algorithmic standpoint. The comparison is carried out via the study of a set of numerical benchmark cases using industrial-like fine-discretization meshes (around 1 million finite elements), and Matlab as the common computational platform, to ensure fair comparisons. Then, the results obtained for every benchmark case with the different methods are compared in terms of computational cost, topology quality, achieved minimum value of the objective function, and robustness of the computations (convergence in objective function and topology). Finally, some quantitative and qualitative results are presented, from which, an attempt of qualification of the methods, in terms of their relative performance, is done.</jats:p>},

For purposes of comparison, we specifically consider the standard test case of a center-crack panel loaded in biaxial tension and assess the convergence of the energy error as the length scale parameter and mesh size tend to zero simultaneously. The panel is discretized by means of a regular mesh consisting of standard bilinear or Q1 elements. The exact stresses from the known analytical linear elastic solution are applied to the boundary. All element integrals over the interior and the boundary of the domain are evaluated exactly using the symbolic computation program Mathematica. When the EE inelastic energy is enhanced by means of Richardson extrapolation, EE is found to converge at twice the rate of PF and to exhibit much better accuracy. In addition, EE affords a one-order-of-magnitude computational speed-up over PF.},

@article{SpaceTimeTopoWang2020,
  abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The design of optimal structures and the planning of (additive manufacturing) fabrication sequences have been considered typically as two separate tasks that are performed consecutively. In the light of recent advances in robot-assisted (wire-arc) additive manufacturing which enable addition of material along curved surfaces, we present a novel topology optimization formulation which concurrently optimizes the structure and the fabrication sequence. For this, two sets of design variables, i.e., a density field for defining the structural layout, and a time field which determines the fabrication process order, are simultaneously optimized. These two fields allow to generate a sequence of intermediate structures, upon which manufacturing constraints (e.g., fabrication continuity and speed) are imposed. The proposed space-time formulation is general, and is demonstrated on three fabrication settings, considering self-weight of the intermediate structures, process-dependent critical loads, and time-dependent material properties.</jats:p>},

  abstract = {Dynamic fracture of heterogeneous materials is investigated by measuring displacement fields as a rupture propagates through a periodic array of obstacles of controlled toughness. We provide direct evidence of crack speed jumps at the boundary of obstacles. Our experiments reveal that such a discontinuous dynamics emerges from rate-dependent fracture energy, which combined with inertia, allows the crack to cross a toughness discontinuity at constant energy release rate. The rate-dependency, a direct consequence of the out-of-equilibrium nature of fracture phenomenon that is often neglected, plays a central role in setting up homogenized toughness, leading ultimately to increased resistance to failure.},

  abstract = {<jats:p> Mesoscale modeling and simulation approaches provide a bridge from atomic-scale methods to the macroscale. The phase field (PF) method has emerged as a powerful and popular tool for mesoscale simulation of microstructure evolution, and its use is growing at an ever-increasing rate. While initial research using the PF method focused on model development, as it has matured it has been used more and more for material discovery. In this review we focus on applying the PF method for material discovery. We start with a brief summary of the method, including numerical approaches for solving the PF equations. We then give seven examples of the application of the PF method for material discovery. We also discuss four barriers to its use for material discovery and provide approaches for how these barriers can be overcome. Finally, we detail four lessons that can be learned from the examples on how best to apply the PF method for material discovery. </jats:p>},

  abstract = {We present a new approach and an algorithm for optimizing the material configuration and behaviour of a fluid saturated porous medium in a two-scale setting. The state problem is governed by the Biot model describing the fluid-structure interaction in homogenized poroelastic structures. However, the approach is widely applicable to multiphysics problems involving several macroscopic fields where homogenization provides the relationship between the microconfigurations and the macroscopic mathematical model. The optimization variables describe the local microstructure design by virtue of the pore shape which determines the effective medium properties - the material coefficients - computed by the homogenization method. The main idea of the numerical optimization strategy consists in a) employing a precomputed database of the material coefficients associated to the geometric parameters and b) applying the sequential global programming (SGP) method for solving the problem of macroscopically optimized distribution of material coefficients. Although there are similarities with the free material optimization (FMO) approach, only effective material coefficients are considered admissible, for which a well-defined set of corresponding configurable microstructures exist. Due to the flexibility of the SGP approach, different types of microstructures with fully independent parametrizations can easily be handled. The efficiency of the concept is demonstrated by a series of numerical experiments. We show that the SGP method can handle simultaneously multiple types of microstructures with nontrivial parametrizations using a considerably low and stable number of state problems to be solved.},

@article{PhaseFieldModellingAnalysisDammass2022,
  abstract = {Fracture of materials with rate-dependent mechanical behaviour, e.g. polymers, is a highly complex process. For an adequate modelling, the coupling between rate-dependent stiffness, dissipative mechanisms present in the bulk material and crack driving force has to be accounted for in an appropriate manner. In addition, the fracture toughness, i.e. the resistance against crack propagation, can depend on rate of deformation. In this contribution, an energetic phase-field model of rate-dependent fracture at finite deformation is presented. For the deformation of the bulk material, a formulation of finite viscoelasticity is adopted with strain energy densities of Ogden type assumed. The unified formulation allows to study different expressions for the fracture driving force. Furthermore, a possibly rate-dependent toughness is incorporated. The model is calibrated using experimental results from the literature for an elastomer and predictions are qualitatively and quantitatively validated against experimental data. Predictive capabilities of the model are studied for monotonic loads as well as creep fracture. Symmetrical and asymmetrical crack patterns are discussed and the influence of a dissipative fracture driving force contribution is analysed. It is shown that, different from ductile fracture of metals, such a driving force is not required for an adequate simulation of experimentally observable crack paths and is not favourable for the description of failure in viscoelastic rubbery polymers. Furthermore, the influence of a rate-dependent toughness is discussed by means of a numerical study. From a phenomenological point of view, it is demonstrated that rate-dependency of resistance against crack propagation can be an essential ingredient for the model when specific effects such as rate-dependent brittle-to-ductile transitions shall be described.},

@article{AComputationalKeLu2022,
  abstract = {<jats:p xml:lang="en">Computational homogenization allows to let the macroscopic constitutive behavior of materials emerge from microscale simulations without loss of generality with respect to microstructure and microscale constitutive response. Although computationally demanding, computational homogenization works very well for the hardening response of materials where the macroscopic stress and strain fields are smooth. However, in case of softening materials, when localization of deformation takes place, special care is needed to ensure objectivity of the method. In this paper, a generic multiscale computational homogenization approach for modeling onset and propagation of cracks in heterogeneous materials that is capable of considering various microscale mechanisms is presented. The common acoustic tensor bifurcation criterion is reinforced by an additional condition to help detect the localization mode more robustly. After the onset of macroscale localization, a key scale transition parameter is needed to translate the macroscopic displacement jump to an averaged strain over the micromodel domain. Then the macroscale crack is governed by a homogenized traction-separation relation evaluated from the underlying micromodel in which micro-failure accumulates. The scale transition parameter is studied for a range of different scenarios and endowed with a geometrical interpretation. Various numerical tests have been performed to confirm the objectivity and validity of the framework. The framework is generic in the sense that no assumptions on the microscale constitutive or kinematic representation of material failure are made in the scale transition. The framework is also highly compatible with the first order computational homogenization, which minimizes the additional complexity of adding macroscopic crack growth to the computational implementation.</jats:p>},

@phdthesis{RobustMonteCaVeach1998,
  abstract = {Light transport algorithms generate realistic images by simulating
the emission and scattering of light in an artificial environment.
Applications include lighting design, architecture, and computer
animation, while related engineering disciplines include neutron
transport and radiative heat transfer. The main challenge with
these algorithms is the high complexity of the geometric,
scattering, and illumination models used. In this dissertation, we
develop new Monte Carlo techniques that greatly extend the range of
input models for which light transport simulations are practical.
We start by developing a rigorous theoretical basis for
bidirectional light transport algorithms (those that combine direct
and adjoint techniques). We propose a new formulation based on
linear operators, such that for any physically valid input scene,
the transport operators are symmetric. We also show how light
transport can be formulated as an integral over a space of paths.
This framework allows new sampling and integration techniques to be
applied, such as the Metropolis sampling method.Our statistical
contributions include multiple importance sampling, a new variance
reduction technique that can greatly increase the robustness of
Monte Carlo integration. It uses more than one sampling technique
to evaluate an integral, and combines these samples in a way that
is provably close to optimal.Finally, we propose new Monte Carlo
light transport algorithms. Bidirectional path tracing uses a
family of different path sampling techniques that generate some
path vertices starting from a light source, and some starting from
a sensor. We show that when these techniques are combined using
multiple importance sampling, a large range of difficult lighting
effects can be handled efficiently.The second algorithm we describe
is Metropolis light transport, inspired by the Metropolis sampling
method from computational physics. Paths are generated by following
a random walk through path space, such that the probability density
of visiting each path is proportional the contribution it makes to
the ideal image. The resulting algorithm is unbiased, handles
arbitrary geometry and materials, and can be orders of magnitude
more efficient than previous unbiased approaches for difficult
lighting problems. To our knowledge, this is the first application
of the Metropolis method to transport problems of any kind.},

Here, we study the peeling response of thin films with nonuniform thickness profile attached to a rigid substrate through a planar homogeneous interface. We show both analytically and using finite element analysis that patterning the film thickness may lead to direction-dependent adhesion such that the force required to peel the film in one direction is different from the force required in the other direction, without any change to the film material, the substrate interfacial geometry, or the adhesive material properties. Furthermore, we show that this asymmetry is tunable through modifying the geometric characteristics of the thin film to obtain higher asymmetry ratios than reported previously in the literature. We discuss our findings in the broader context of enhancing interfacial response by modulating the bulk geometric or compositional properties.</jats:p>},

We investigate the structure of such relaxations by means of measure theory and Fourier analysis, enabling us to shed light on the success of many associated stochastic optimization methods. The main structural traits we derive and that allow fast and reliable optimization of relaxations are the consistency of optimal values of f, Lipschitzness of gradients, and convexity. We emphasize settings where f itself is not differentiable or convex, e.g., in the presence of (stochastic) disturbance.},

This tutorial covers the algorithm and its application, illustrating concepts through a range of examples, including Bernoulli bandit problems, shortest path problems, product recommendation, assortment, active learning with neural networks, and reinforcement learning in Markov decision processes. Most of these problems involve complex information structures, where information revealed by taking an action informs beliefs about other actions.

@article{BayesOptDeepHebbal2019,
  abstract = {Bayesian Optimization using Gaussian Processes is a popular approach to deal with the optimization of expensive black-box functions. However, because of the a priori on the stationarity of the covariance matrix of classic Gaussian Processes, this method may not be adapted for non-stationary functions involved in the optimization problem. To overcome this issue, a new Bayesian Optimization approach is proposed. It is based on Deep Gaussian Processes as surrogate models instead of classic Gaussian Processes. This modeling technique increases the power of representation to capture the non-stationarity by simply considering a functional composition of stationary Gaussian Processes, providing a multiple layer structure. This paper proposes a new algorithm for Global Optimization by coupling Deep Gaussian Processes and Bayesian Optimization. The specificities of this optimization method are discussed and highlighted with academic test cases. The performance of the proposed algorithm is assessed on analytical test cases and an aerospace design optimization problem and compared to the state-of-the-art stationary and non-stationary Bayesian Optimization approaches.},

  abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The prediction of crack initiation and propagation in ductile failure processes are challenging tasks for the design and fabrication of metallic materials and structures on a large scale. Numerical aspects of ductile failure dictate a sub-optimal calibration of plasticity- and fracture-related parameters for a large number of material properties. These parameters enter the system of partial differential equations as a forward model. Thus, an accurate estimation of the material parameters enables the precise determination of the material response in different stages, particularly for the post-yielding regime, where crack initiation and propagation take place. In this work, we develop a Bayesian inversion framework for ductile fracture to provide accurate knowledge regarding the <jats:italic>effective</jats:italic> mechanical parameters. To this end, synthetic and experimental observations are used to estimate the posterior density of the unknowns. To model the ductile failure behavior of solid materials, we rely on the phase-field approach to fracture, for which we present a <jats:italic>unified</jats:italic> formulation that allows recovering different models on a variational basis. In the variational framework, incremental minimization principles for a class of gradient-type dissipative materials are used to derive the governing equations. The overall formulation is revisited and extended to the case of anisotropic ductile fracture. Three different models are subsequently recovered by certain choices of parameters and constitutive functions, which are later assessed through Bayesian inversion techniques. A <jats:italic>step-wise</jats:italic> Bayesian inversion method is proposed to determine the posterior density of the material unknowns for a ductile phase-field fracture process. To estimate the posterior density function of ductile material parameters, three common Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques are employed: (i) the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm, (ii) delayed-rejection adaptive Metropolis, and (iii) ensemble Kalman filter combined with MCMC. To examine the computational efficiency of the MCMC methods, we employ the <jats:inline-formula><jats:alternatives><jats:tex-math>$$\hat{R}{-}convergence$$</jats:tex-math><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">

  abstract = {While most Gaussian processes (GP) work focus on learning single-output functions, many applications, such as physical simulations and gene expressions prediction, require estimations of functions with many outputs. The number of outputs can be much larger than or comparable to the size of training samples. Existing multi-output GP models either are limited to low-dimensional outputs and restricted kernel choices,  or assume oversimplified low-rank structures within the outputs. To address these issues, we propose HOGPR, a High-Order Gaussian Process Regression model, which can flexibly capture complex correlations among the outputs and scale up to a large number of outputs. Specifically, we tensorize the high-dimensional outputs, introducing latent coordinate features to index each tensor element (i.e., output) and to capture their correlations. We then generalize a multilinear model to a hybrid of a GP and latent GP model. The model is endowed with a Kronecker product structure over the inputs and the latent features. Using the Kronecker product properties and tensor algebra, we are able to perform exact inference over millions of outputs. We show the advantage of the proposed model on several real-world applications.},

               <jats:p>The task is undertaken of determining the bearing pressures, and the stresses and deformations created by them, in some cases that differ from those considered by Hertz in his classical study of contact. Thus two solids are examined which, before loading, are in contact along a row of evenly spaced lines in a horizontal plane, as indicated in Fig. 1(a). Between these lines the surfaces have a separation defined by a nearly flat cosine wave. A uniform pressure on top of the upper solid creates contact over an area consisting of a row of strips, reduces the separation of the solids between the strips, as suggested in Fig. 1(b), and creates contact pressures distributed as indicated in Fig. 1(c), with vertical rises in the diagram of pressure at the edges of the strips. At a greater load the width of the strip becomes equal to the wave length, and the contact is complete. At still greater loads the stresses increase as if the two solids were one. The procedure by which this problem is solved is demonstrated first by showing its easy application to some well-known cases, especially Hertz’s problem of circular cylinders in contact.</jats:p>
               <jats:p>Further applications are to a noncircular cylinder resting on a solid with a flat top, with an initial separation of the surfaces varying as the fourth power of the distance from the initial line of contact; to partial contact of two surfaces which are initially plane, except that one of them has a ridge or several parallel ridges; and to some related problems in which two parts of the same body are partially separated by the forming of one or more cracks.</jats:p>},

  abstract = {<jats:p>Based on the theory of peridynamics, the least squares and the moving least squares method are proposed to fit the physical information at nondiscrete points. It makes up for the shortcomings of the peridynamic method that only solves the discrete nodes and cannot obtain the physical information of other blank areas. The extended method is used to fit the one-way vibration problem of the rod, and the curve of the displacement of a nondiscrete node in the rod is extracted with time. The fitted displacement results are compared with the theoretical results to verify the feasibility of the fitting method. At the same time, the parameters in the fitting of the moving least squares method are optimized, and the effects of different tight weight functions and influence ranges on the results are analyzed. The results show that when the weight function is a power exponential function, the fitting effect increases with the decrease in the coefficient. When the weight function is a cubic spline weight function, a better fitting effect is obtained. And in the case of ensuring the fitting result, the affected area should be reduced as much as possible, and the calculation efficiency and precision can be improved.</jats:p>},

The methodology developed in our previous works, combining evolutionary topology optimization and phase field method to fracture embedding interfacial damage, is applied and extended to periodic composites and multiple objectives. On one hand, we constrain the periodicity of unit cells geometry and conduct their topology optimization for one given load prescribed over the whole structure. On the other hand, we consider a single unit cell whose topology is optimized with respect to the fracture energy criterion when subjected to multiple loads. Size effects are investigated. We show that significant enhancement of the fracture resistance can be achieved for the studied composite structures by the present method. In addition, a first attempt to fracture resistance enhancement of a unit cell associated with a material is investigated for multiple loads, exhibiting a complex optimized microstructure.</jats:p>},

The problem is important to the micromechanics of crack advance in brittle, locally heterogeneous solids. The formulation is based on a linear perturbation result for the stress intensity factor distribution along the front of a half-plane crack when the location of that front differs moderately from a straight line. The trapping solutions for a periodic array of blocking rectangular obstacles are given using an analogy to the plane stress Dugdale/BCS elastic-plastic crack model. For a periodic array of obstacles with a given spacing and size in the direction parallel to the crack front, the obstacle shape may affect the limit load at which the crack breaks through the array. When such effects are examined within the range of validity of the linear perturbation theory, it is found that obstacles whose cross-sections fully envelop a critical reference area give the maximum limit load while others are broken through at lower load levels. We also formulate a numerical procedure using the FFT technique and adopting a “viscoplastic” crack growth model which, in an appropriate limit, simulates crack growth at a critical stress intensity factor. This is applied to show how a crack front begins to surround and penetrate into various arrays of round obstacles (with a toughness ratio of 2) as the applied load is gradually increased. The limitations of the first-order analysis restrict its validity to obstacles only slightly tougher than the surrounding elastic medium. Recently, Fares (1988) analyzed the crack trapping problem by a Boundary Element Method (BEM) with results indicating that the first-order linear analysis is acceptable when the fracture of toughness of the obstacles differs by a moderate amount from that of their surroundings (e.g., the toughness ratio can be as large as 2 for circular obstacles spaced by 2 diameters). However, the first-order theory is not only quantitatively inaccurate, but can make qualitatively wrong predictions when applied to very tough obstacles.</jats:p>},

Despite the rapid progress in the field, there is still a need for efficient strategies to optimize metamaterial design for a variety of functions. We present a computational method for the automatic design of mechanical metamaterial actuators that combines a reinforced Monte Carlo method with discrete element simulations. 3D printing of selected mechanical metamaterial actuators shows that the machine-generated structures can reach high efficiency, exceeding human-designed structures. We also show that it is possible to design efficient actuators by training a deep neural network which is then able to predict the efficiency from the image of a structure and to identify its functional regions. The elementary actuators devised here can be combined to produce metamaterial machines of arbitrary complexity for countless engineering applications.</jats:p>},

@article{OptimizationOfGuGr2016,
  abstract = {<jats:p>A paradigm in nature is to architect composites with excellent material properties compared to its constituents, which themselves often have contrasting mechanical behavior. Most engineering materials sacrifice strength for toughness, whereas natural materials do not face this tradeoff. However, biology's designs, adapted for organism survival, may have features not needed for some engineering applications. Here, we postulate that mimicking nature's elegant use of multimaterial phases can lead to better optimization of engineered materials. We employ an optimization algorithm to explore and design composites using soft and stiff building blocks to study the underlying mechanisms of nature's tough materials. For different applications, optimization parameters may vary. Validation of the algorithm is carried out using a test suite of cases without cracks to optimize for stiffness and compliance individually. A test case with a crack is also performed to optimize for toughness. The validation shows excellent agreement between geometries obtained from the optimization algorithm and the brute force method. This study uses different objective functions to optimize toughness, stiffness and toughness, and compliance and toughness. The algorithm presented here can provide researchers a way to tune material properties for a vast number of engineering problems by adjusting the distribution of soft and stiff materials.</jats:p>},

  abstract = {<jats:p>The phase field paradigm, in combination with a suitable variational structure, has opened a path for using Griffith’s energy balance to predict the fracture of solids. These so-called phase field fracture methods have gained significant popularity over the past decade, and are now part of commercial finite element packages and engineering fitness- for-service assessments. Crack paths can be predicted, in arbitrary geometries and dimensions, based on a global energy minimization—without the need for ad hoc criteria. In this work, we review the fundamentals of phase field fracture methods and examine their capabilities in delivering predictions in agreement with the classical fracture mechanics theory pioneered by Griffith. The two most widely used phase field fracture models are implemented in the context of the finite element method, and several paradigmatic boundary value problems are addressed to gain insight into their predictive abilities across all cracking stages; both the initiation of growth and stable crack propagation are investigated. In addition, we examine the effectiveness of phase field models with an internal material length scale in capturing size effects and the transition flaw size concept. Our results show that phase field fracture methods satisfactorily approximate classical fracture mechanics predictions and can also reconcile stress and toughness criteria for fracture. The accuracy of the approximation is however dependent on modelling and constitutive choices; we provide a rationale for these differences and identify suitable approaches for delivering phase field fracture predictions that are in good agreement with well-established fracture mechanics paradigms.</jats:p>

@article{ProbabilisticFailureNoii2022,
  abstract = {A probabilistic approach to phase-field brittle and ductile fracture with random material and geometric properties is proposed within this work. In the macroscopic failure mechanics, materials properties and spatial quantities (of different phases in the geometrical domain) are assumed to be homogeneous and deterministic. This is unlike the lower scale with strong fluctuation in the material and geometrical properties. Such a response is approximated through some uncertainty in the model problem. The presented contribution is devoted to providing a mathematical framework for modeling uncertainty through stochastic analysis of a microstructure undergoing brittle/ductile failure. Hereby, the proposed model employs various representative volume elements with random distribution of stiff inclusions and voids within the composite structure. We develop an allocating strategy to allocate the heterogeneities and generate the corresponding meshes in two- and three-dimensional cases. Then the Monte Carlo Finite Element Method (MC-FEM) is employed for solving the stochastic PDE-based model and approximate the expectation and the variance of the solution field of brittle/ductile failure by evaluating a large number of samples. For the prediction of failure mechanisms, we rely on the phase-field approach which is a widely adopted framework for modeling and computing the fracture phenomena in solids. Incremental perturbed minimization principles for a class of gradient-type dissipative materials are used to derive the perturbed governing equations. This analysis enables us to study the highly heterogeneous microstructure and monitor the uncertainty in failure mechanics. Several numerical examples are given to examine the efficiency of the proposed method.},

@article{PhaseFieldModHansen2021,
  abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In this contribution, a variational diffuse modeling framework for cracks in heterogeneous media is presented. A static order parameter smoothly bridges the discontinuity at material interfaces, while an evolving phase-field captures the regularized crack. The key novelty is the combination of a strain energy split with a partial rank-I relaxation in the vicinity of the diffuse interface. The former is necessary to account for physically meaningful crack kinematics like crack closure, the latter ensures the mechanical jump conditions throughout the diffuse region. The model is verified by a convergence study, where a circular bi-material disc with and without a crack is subjected to radial loads. For the uncracked case, analytical solutions are taken as reference. In a second step, the model is applied to crack propagation, where a meaningful influence on crack branching is observed, that underlines the necessity of a reasonable homogenization scheme. The presented model is particularly relevant for the combination of any variational strain energy split in the fracture phase-field model with a diffuse modeling approach for material heterogeneities.</jats:p>},

  abstract = {We consider optimization of composite objective functions, i.e., of the form $f(x)=g(h(x))$, where $h$ is a black-box derivative-free expensive-to-evaluate function with vector-valued outputs, and $g$ is a cheap-to-evaluate real-valued function. While these problems can be solved with standard Bayesian optimization, we propose a novel approach that exploits the composite structure of the objective function to substantially improve sampling efficiency. Our approach models $h$ using a multi-output Gaussian process and chooses where to sample using the expected improvement evaluated on the implied non-Gaussian posterior on $f$, which we call expected improvement for composite functions (\ei). Although \ei\ cannot be computed in closed form, we provide a novel stochastic gradient estimator that allows its efficient maximization. We also show that our approach is asymptotically consistent, i.e., that it recovers a globally optimal solution as sampling effort grows to infinity, generalizing previous convergence results for classical expected improvement. Numerical experiments show that our approach dramatically outperforms standard Bayesian optimization benchmarks, reducing simple regret by several orders of magnitude.},

  abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This paper presents a Python wrapper and extended functionality of the parallel topology optimization framework introduced by Aage et al. (Topology optimization using PETSc: an easy-to-use, fully parallel, open source topology optimization framework. Struct Multidiscip Optim 51(3):565–572, 2015). The Python interface, which simplifies the problem definition, is intended to expand the potential user base and to ease the use of large-scale topology optimization for educational purposes. The functionality of the topology optimization framework is extended to include passive domains and local volume constraints among others, which contributes to its usability to real-world design applications. The functionality is demonstrated via the cantilever beam, bracket and torsion ball examples. Several tests are provided which can be used to verify the proper installation and for evaluating the performance of the user’s system setup.

  abstract = {Kernel regression is a well-established method for nonlinear regression in which the target value for a test point is estimated using a weighted average of the surrounding training samples. The weights are typically obtained by applying a distance-based kernel function to each of the samples, which presumes the existence of a well-defined distance metric. In this paper, we construct a novel algorithm for supervised metric learning, which learns a distance function by directly minimizing the leave-one-out regression error. We show that our algorithm makes kernel regression comparable with the state of the art on several benchmark datasets, and we provide efficient implementation details enabling application to datasets with &nbsp;O(10k) instances. Further, we show that our algorithm can be viewed as a supervised variation of PCA and can be used for dimensionality reduction and high dimensional data visualization.},

@article{CrashworthinessPatel2009,
  abstract = {<jats:p>Crashworthiness design is an evolving discipline that combines vehicle crash simulation and design synthesis. The goal is to increase passenger safety subject to manufacturing cost constraints. The crashworthiness design process requires modeling of the complex interactions involved in a crash event. Current approaches utilize a parametrized optimization approach that requires response surface approximations of the design space. This is due to the expensive nature of numerical crash simulations and the high nonlinearity and noisiness in the design space. These methodologies usually require a significant effort to determine an initial design concept. In this paper, a heuristic approach to continuum-based topology optimization is developed for crashworthiness design. The methodology utilizes the cellular automata paradigm to generate three-dimensional design concepts. Furthermore, a constraint on maximum displacement is implemented to maintain a desired performance of the structures synthesized. Example design problems are used to demonstrate that the proposed methodology converges to a final topology in an efficient manner.</jats:p>},

A boundary value problem simulating a periodic array of rigid spherical inclusions in an isotropically hardening elastic-viscoplastic matrix is analyzed. Dimensional considerations introduce a characteristic length into the formulation and, depending on the ratio of this characteristic length to the inclusion radius, decohesion occurs either in a “ductile” or “brittle” manner. The effect of the triaxiality of the imposed stress state on nucleation is studied and the numerical results are related to the description of void nucleation within a phenomenological constitutive framework for progressively cavitating solids.</jats:p>},

@article{10.1162/106365601750190398,
  abstract = {{This paper puts forward two useful methods for self-adaptation of the mutation distribution - the concepts of derandomization and cumulation. Principle shortcomings of the concept of mutative strategy parameter control and two levels of derandomization are reviewed. Basic demands on the self-adaptation of arbitrary (normal) mutation distributions are developed. Applying arbitrary, normal mutation distributions is equiv-alent to applying a general, linear problem encoding.The underlying objective of mutative strategy parameter control is roughly to favor previously selected mutation steps in the future. If this objective is pursued rigor-ously, a completely derandomized self-adaptation scheme results, which adapts arbitrary normal mutation distributions. This scheme, called covariance matrix adaptation (CMA), meets the previously stated demands. It can still be considerably improved by cumulation - utilizing an evolution path rather than single search steps.Simulations on various test functions reveal local and global search properties of the evolution strategy with and without covariance matrix adaptation. Their performances are comparable only on perfectly scaled functions. On badly scaled, non-separable functions usually a speed up factor of several orders of magnitude is ob-served. On moderately mis-scaled functions a speed up factor of three to ten can be expected.}},

@article{ThinkingInsideAstudillo2022,
  abstract = {Bayesian optimization (BO) is a framework for global optimization of expensive-to-evaluate objective functions. Classical BO methods assume that the objective function is a black box. However, internal information about objective function computation is often available. For example, when optimizing a manufacturing line's throughput with simulation, we observe the number of parts waiting at each workstation, in addition to the overall throughput. Recent BO methods leverage such internal information to dramatically improve performance. We call these "grey-box" BO methods because they treat objective computation as partially observable and even modifiable, blending the black-box approach with so-called "white-box" first-principles knowledge of objective function computation. This tutorial describes these methods, focusing on BO of composite objective functions, where one can observe and selectively evaluate individual constituents that feed into the overall objective; and multi-fidelity BO, where one can evaluate cheaper approximations of the objective function by varying parameters of the evaluation oracle.},

@article{BoTorch2019,
  abstract = {Bayesian optimization provides sample-efficient global optimization for a broad range of applications, including automatic machine learning, engineering, physics, and experimental design. We introduce BoTorch, a modern programming framework for Bayesian optimization that combines Monte-Carlo (MC) acquisition functions, a novel sample average approximation optimization approach, auto-differentiation, and variance reduction techniques. BoTorch's modular design facilitates flexible specification and optimization of probabilistic models written in PyTorch, simplifying implementation of new acquisition functions. Our approach is backed by novel theoretical convergence results and made practical by a distinctive algorithmic foundation that leverages fast predictive distributions, hardware acceleration, and deterministic optimization. We also propose a novel "one-shot" formulation of the Knowledge Gradient, enabled by a combination of our theoretical and software contributions. In experiments, we demonstrate the improved sample efficiency of BoTorch relative to other popular libraries.},

  abstract = {Advances in the computational modeling of fracture of solids have opened up new possibilities for structural design optimization to enhance fracture properties. Here, we investigate material optimization and design to improve fracture behavior of composite structures under quasi-static conditions. The rate-independent structural problem considering cohesive fracture is ill-posed in its original form due to the non-unique nature of the solution. This renders the use of gradient-based optimization algorithms problematic. To overcome this issue, we introduce viscous regularization and a local approximation of the cohesive law into the governing state equations, and study the impact with the help of interfacial fracture of composite structures consisting of two or more materials. The fracture problem is then integrated into a material optimization framework. We study the effect of viscous regularization on the global landscape of the proposed objective function using a 2-dimensional delamination example with one design parameter and discuss difficulties resulting from the stabilization of inherently unstable crack states. In view of these issues, we finally propose considering multiple state problems, each limited to a single crack, with different predefined crack paths. In the end, we optimize the orientations of orthotropic inclusions embedded in a double-cantilever beam for the worst case of the potential crack paths.},

  abstract = {We consider Bayesian optimization of objective functions of the form $\rho[ F(x, W) ]$, where $F$ is a black-box expensive-to-evaluate function and $\rho$ denotes either the VaR or CVaR risk measure, computed with respect to the randomness induced by the environmental random variable $W$. Such problems arise in decision making under uncertainty, such as in portfolio optimization and robust systems design. We propose a family of novel Bayesian optimization algorithms that exploit the structure of the objective function to substantially improve sampling efficiency. Instead of modeling the objective function directly as is typical in Bayesian optimization, these algorithms model $F$ as a Gaussian process, and use the implied posterior on the objective function to decide which points to evaluate. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a variety of numerical experiments.},

The manifold is represented as a set of overlapping neighborhoods, and extended by an added neighborhood of a boundary point. The boundary point is found using an expression for the boundary in terms of the vertices of a set of finite, convex polyhedra. The resulting algorithm is quite simple, allows adaptive spacing of the computed points, and deals with the problems of local and global overlap in a natural way. The algorithm is robust (the new points need only be near the boundary), and is well suited to problems with large embedding dimension, and small to moderate dimension. </jats:p>},

  abstract = {Many applications in machine learning require optimizing a function whose true gradient is unknown or computationally expensive, but where surrogate gradient information, directions that may be correlated with the true gradient, is cheaply available. For example, this occurs when an approximate gradient is easier to compute than the full gradient (e.g. in meta-learning or unrolled optimization), or when a true gradient is intractable and is replaced with a surrogate (e.g. in reinforcement learning or training networks with discrete variables). We propose Guided Evolutionary Strategies (GES), a method for optimally using surrogate gradient directions to accelerate random search. GES defines a search distribution for evolutionary strategies that is elongated along a subspace spanned by the surrogate gradients and estimates a descent direction which can then be passed to a first-order optimizer. We analytically and numerically characterize the tradeoffs that result from tuning how strongly the search distribution is stretched along the guiding subspace and use this to derive a setting of the hyperparameters that works well across problems. We evaluate GES on several example problems, demonstrating an improvement over both standard evolutionary strategies and first-order methods that directly follow the surrogate gradient.},

This computational expense may be particularly burdensome in many-query applications, such as optimization. We develop a stress-constrained topology optimization method for lattice-like structures that uses component-wise reduced order models as a cheap surrogate, providing accurate computation of stress fields while greatly reducing run time relative to a full order model. We demonstrate the ability of our method to produce large reductions in mass while respecting a constraint on the maximum stress in a pair of test problems. The ROM methodology provides a speedup of about 150x in forward solves compared to full order static condensation and provides a relative error of less than 5% in the relaxed stress.},

@inproceedings{OnTheSurprisiAggarw2001,
  abstract = {In recent years, the effect of the curse of high dimensionality
has been studied in great detail on several problems such as
clustering, nearest neighbor search, and indexing. In high
dimensional space the data becomes sparse, and traditional indexing
and algorithmic techniques fail from a efficiency and/or
effectiveness perspective. Recent research results show that in
high dimensional space, the concept of proximity, distance or
nearest neighbor may not even be qualitatively meaningful. In this
paper, we view the dimensionality curse from the point of view of
the distance metrics which are used to measure the similarity
between objects. We specifically examine the behavior of the
commonly used Lk norm and show that the problem of meaningfulness
in high dimensionality is sensitive to the value of k. For example,
this means that the Manhattan distance metric (L1 norm) is
consistently more preferable than the Euclidean distance metric (L2
norm) for high dimensional data mining applications. Using the
intuition derived from our analysis, we introduce and examine a
natural extension of the Lk norm to fractional distance metrics. We
show that the fractional distance metric provides more meaningful
results both from the theoretical and empirical perspective. The
results show that fractional distance metrics can significantly
improve the effectiveness of standard clustering algorithms such as
the k-means algorithm.},

  abstract = {<jats:p>In many optimization problems arising from scientific, engineering and artificial intelligence applications, objective and constraint functions are available only as the output of a black-box or simulation oracle that does not provide derivative information. Such settings necessitate the use of methods for derivative-free, or zeroth-order, optimization. We provide a review and perspectives on developments in these methods, with an emphasis on highlighting recent developments and on unifying treatment of such problems in the non-linear optimization and machine learning literature. We categorize methods based on assumed properties of the black-box functions, as well as features of the methods. We first overview the primary setting of deterministic methods applied to unconstrained, non-convex optimization problems where the objective function is defined by a deterministic black-box oracle. We then discuss developments in randomized methods, methods that assume some additional structure about the objective (including convexity, separability and general non-smooth compositions), methods for problems where the output of the black-box oracle is stochastic, and methods for handling different types of constraints.</jats:p>},

  abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Multi-fidelity optimization schemes enriching expensive high-fidelity functions with cheap-to-evaluate low-fidelity functions have gained popularity in recent years. In the present work, an optimization scheme based on a hierarchical kriging is proposed for large-scale and highly non-linear crashworthiness problems. After comparison to other multi-fidelity techniques an infill criterion called variable-fidelity expected improvement is applied and evaluated. This is complemented by two innovative techniques, a new approach regarding initial sampling and a novel way to generate the low-fidelity model for crash problems are suggested. For the former, a modified Latin hypercube sampling, pushing samples more towards design space boundaries, increases the quality of sampling selection. For the latter, a projection-based non-intrusive model order reduction technique accelerates and simplifies the low-fidelity model evaluation. The proposed techniques are investigated with two application problems from the field of automotive crashworthiness—a size optimization problem for lateral impact and a shape optimization problem for frontal impact. The use of a multi-fidelity scheme compared to baseline single-fidelity optimization saves computational effort while keeping an acceptable level of accuracy. Both suggested modifications, independently and especially combined, increase computational performance and result quality in the presented examples.</jats:p>},

<jats:p>The problem of toughening heterogeneous materials with a stiff matrix and compliant inclusions is investigated through numerical simulations and experiments. Specifically, the problem of optimizing a combination of effective toughness and effective elastic modulus in the context of a square array of compliant inclusions in a stiff matrix is explored. Crack propagation in the heterogeneous material is simulated using a variational phase-field approach. It is found that the crack can meander between or get attracted to and trapped in the inclusions. Composite specimens with a stiff matrix and compliant circular inclusions were 3D printed, and their fracture toughness was measured using a specially designed loading fixture. The experimental results show agreement with the numerical predictions by demonstrating the attraction and trapping of cracks in the inclusions. This study demonstrates the potential for significant enhancement of toughness through elastic compliance contrast between the matrix and the inclusion without notably compromising the effective elastic modulus of the composite material.</jats:p>},

TP-AIS iteratively builds a proposal distribution parameterized by a tree pyramid, where each tree leaf spans a subspace that represents its importance density. After each new sample operation, a set of tree leaves are subdivided for improving the approximation of the proposal distribution to the target density. Unlike the rest of the methods in the literature, TP-AIS is parameter free and requires no tuning to achieve its best performance. We evaluate TP-AIS with different complexity randomized target probability density functions (PDF) and also analyze its application to different dimensions. The results are compared to state-of-the-art iterative importance sampling approaches and other baseline MCMC approaches using Normalized Effective Sample Size (N-ESS), Jensen-Shannon Divergence, and time complexity.},

In this work, we address the challenge to couple density-based topology optimization and node-based shape optimization into a single optimization problem by using an embedding domain discretization technique. In our approach, a variable shape is explicitly represented by the boundary of an embedded body. Furthermore, the embedding domain in form of a structured mesh allows us to introduce a variable, pseudo-density field. In this way, we attempt to bring the advantages of both topology and shape optimization methods together and to provide an efficient way to design fine-tuned structures without predefined topological features.</jats:p>},

  abstract = {Fracture involves interaction across large and small length scales. With the application of enough stress or strain to a brittle material, atomistic scale bonds will break, leading to fracture of the macroscopic specimen. From the perspective of mechanics fracture should appear as an emergent phenomena generated by a continuum field theory eliminating the need for a supplemental kinetic relation describing crack growth. We develop a new fast method for modeling quasi-static fracture using peridynamics. We apply fixed point theory and model stable crack evolution for hard and soft loading. For soft loading we recover unstable fracture. For hard loading we recover stable crack growth. We show existence of quasistatic fracture solutions in the neighborhood of stable critical points for appropriately defined energies. The numerical method uses an analytic stiffness matrix for fast numerical implementation. A rigorous mathematical analysis shows that the method converges for load paths associated with soft and hard loading. For soft loading the crack becomes unstable shortly after the stress at the tip of the pre-crack reaches the material strength.},

  abstract = {<jats:p>Abstract. This paper describes a new parallel, scalable and robust finite element based solver for the first-order Stokes momentum balance equations for ice flow. The solver, known as Albany/FELIX, is constructed using the component-based approach to building application codes, in which mature, modular libraries developed as a part of the Trilinos project are combined using abstract interfaces and template-based generic programming, resulting in a final code with access to dozens of algorithmic and advanced analysis capabilities. Following an overview of the relevant partial differential equations and boundary conditions, the numerical methods chosen to discretize the ice flow equations are described, along with their implementation. The results of several verification studies of the model accuracy are presented using (1) new test cases for simplified two-dimensional (2-D) versions of the governing equations derived using the method of manufactured solutions, and (2) canonical ice sheet modeling benchmarks. Model accuracy and convergence with respect to mesh resolution are then studied on problems involving a realistic Greenland ice sheet geometry discretized using hexahedral and tetrahedral meshes. Also explored as a part of this study is the effect of vertical mesh resolution on the solution accuracy and solver performance. The robustness and scalability of our solver on these problems is demonstrated. Lastly, we show that good scalability can be achieved by preconditioning the iterative linear solver using a new algebraic multilevel preconditioner, constructed based on the idea of semi-coarsening.

  abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In this work, we develop a mixed-mode phase-field fracture model employing a parallel-adaptive quasi-monolithic framework. In nature, failure of rocks and rock-like materials is usually accompanied by the propagation of mixed-mode fractures. To address this aspect, some recent studies have incorporated mixed-mode fracture propagation criteria to classical phase-field fracture models, and new energy splitting methods were proposed to split the total crack driving energy into mode-I and mode-II parts. As extension in this work, a splitting method for masonry-like materials is modified and incorporated into the mixed-mode phase-field fracture model. A robust, accurate and efficient parallel-adaptive quasi-monolithic framework serves as basis for the implementation of our new model. Three numerical tests are carried out, and the results of the new model are compared to those of existing models, demonstrating the numerical robustness and physical soundness of the new model. In total, six models are computationally analyzed and compared.</jats:p>},

We present a blue noise sampling method with good quality and performance across different dimensions. The method, spoke-dart sampling, shoots rays from prior samples and selects samples from these rays. It combines the advantages of two major high-dimensional sampling methods: the locality of advancing front with the dimensionality-reduction of hyperplanes, specifically line sampling. We prove that the output sampling is saturated with high probability, with bounds on distances between pairs of samples and between any domain point and its nearest sample. We demonstrate spoke-dart applications for approximate Delaunay graph construction, global optimization, and robotic motion planning. Both the blue-noise quality of the output distribution and the adaptability of the intermediate processes of our method are useful in these applications.</jats:p>},

The cohesive element governs the separation of the crack flanks in accordance with an irreversible cohesive law, eventually leading to the formation of free surfaces, and is compatible with a conventional finite element discretization of the bulk material. The versatility and predictive ability of the method is demonstrated through the simulation of a drop-weight dynamic fracture test similar to those reported by Zehnder and Rosakis. The ability of the method to approximate the experimentally observed crack-tip trajectory is particularly noteworthy. © 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {<jats:p> We analyze a rate-independent model for damage evolution in elastic bodies. The central quantities are a stored energy functional and a dissipation functional, which is assumed to be positively homogeneous of degree one. Since the energy is not simultaneously (strictly) convex in the damage variable and the displacements, solutions may have jumps as a function of time. The latter circumstance makes it necessary to recur to suitable notions of weak solution. However, the by-now classical concept of global energetic solution fails to describe accurately the behavior of the system at jumps. </jats:p><jats:p> Hence, we consider rate-independent damage models as limits of systems driven by viscous, rate-dependent dissipation. We use a technique for taking the vanishing viscosity limit, which is based on arclength reparametrization. In this way, in the limit we obtain a novel formulation for the rate-independent damage model, which highlights the interplay of viscous and rate-independent effects in the jump regime, and provides a better description of the energetic behavior of the system at jumps. </jats:p>},

Deep Gaussian processes (DGPs) are multi-layer generalisations of GPs, but inference in these models has proved challenging. Existing approaches to inference in DGP models assume approximate posteriors that force independence between the layers, and do not work well in practice. We present a doubly stochastic variational inference algorithm, which does not force independence between layers. With our method of inference we demonstrate that a DGP model can be used effectively on data ranging in size from hundreds to a billion points. We provide strong empirical evidence that our inference scheme for DGPs works well in practice in both classification and regression.},

Several open-source libraries, such as the Sensitivity Analysis Library (SALib), have been published in the recent past aimed at simplifying the application of sensitivity analyses. Still, there remain issues in software usability and accessibility, as well as a lack of guidance in the interpretation of sensitivity analysis results. This paper describes the changes made and planned to SALib to advance the ease with which modelers may conduct sensitivity analysis and interpret results. We further offer our perspectives from the past 7 years of maintaining SALib for the consideration of those aspiring to launch their own software for sensitivity analysis, develop methodology, or those otherwise interested in becoming involved in a project like SALib. These include the value of a community of practice to foster best practices for sensitivity analysis, the potential for collaboration across different software (for sensitivity analysis) platforms, and the need to specifically support the software development that underpins computational science.</jats:p>},

@article{AHybridMultisAlQud2022,
  abstract = {<jats:p>Contact mechanics models based on linearity assumptions, often using the viscoelastic half space theory and numerically implemented with the boundary element method, are known to provide accurate results for small mean square slope of the surface roughness. For large mean square slope, models accounting for finite deformations, often implemented with the non-linear finite element method, are more accurate but lead to a prohibitive computational cost. We propose a new hybrid multiscale approach able to account for the finite deformations arising due to large mean square slope, while keeping a computational cost similar to that associated to linear approaches. The basic strategy is a decomposition of the surface roughness power spectrum into a discrete number of waves, whose spectral range is partitioned into a high mean square slope range and a low mean square slope range. The contact mechanics in the former is accurately solved with the kinematically non-linear model and the results averaged out at the larger wavelength scale in terms of an effective interface interaction law. This law is then applied in the linear simulation involving the scales within the low mean square slope range. The proposed approach is a more accurate alternative to fully linear and a computationally faster alternative to fully non-linear contact mechanics approaches.</jats:p>},

Although Gaussian processes provide a flexible prior over functions which can be queried efficiently, there are various classes of functions that remain difficult to model. One of the most frequently occurring of these is the class of non-stationary functions. The optimization of the hyperparameters of machine learning algorithms is a problem domain in which parameters are often manually transformed a priori, for example by optimizing in "log-space," to mitigate the effects of spatially-varying length scale. We develop a methodology for automatically learning a wide family of bijective transformations or warpings of the input space using the Beta cumulative distribution function. We further extend the warping framework to multi-task Bayesian optimization so that multiple tasks can be warped into a jointly stationary space. On a set of challenging benchmark optimization tasks, we observe that the inclusion of warping greatly improves on the state-of-the-art, producing better results faster and more reliably.},

  abstract = {<jats:p>Optimization of material microstructure is strongly tied with the performance of composite materials at the macroscale and can be used to control desired macroscopic properties. In this paper, we study the optimal location of carbon black (CB) particle inclusions in a natural rubber (NR) matrix with the objective to maximize the rupture resistance of such polymer composites. Hyperelasticity is used to model the rubber matrix and stiff inclusions, and the phase field method is used to model the fracture accounting for large deformation kinematics. A genetic algorithm is employed to solve the inverse problem in which three parameters are proposed as optimization objective, including maximum peak force, maximum deformation at failure-point, and maximum fracture energy at failure-point. Two kinds of optimization variables, continuous and discrete variables, are adopted to describe the location of particles, and several numerical examples are carried out to provide insight into the optimal locations for different objectives.</jats:p>},

  abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
               <jats:p>The recently conceived gap test and its simulation revealed that the fracture energy Gf (or Kc, Jcr) of concrete, plastic-hardening metals, composites, and probably most materials can change by ±100%, depending on the crack-parallel stresses σxx, σzz, and their history. Therefore, one must consider not only a finite length but also a finite width of the fracture process zone, along with its tensorial damage behavior. The data from this test, along with ten other classical tests important for fracture problems (nine on concrete, one on sandstone), are optimally fitted to evaluate the performance of the state-of-art phase-field, peridynamic, and crack band models. Thanks to its realistic boundary and crack-face conditions as well as its tensorial nature, the crack band model, combined with the microplane damage constitutive law in its latest version M7, is found to fit all data well. On the contrary, the phase-field models perform poorly. Peridynamic models (both bond based and state based) perform even worse. The recent correction in the bond-associated deformation gradient helps to improve the predictions in some experiments, but not all. This confirms the previous strictly theoretical critique (JAM 2016), which showed that peridynamics of all kinds suffers from several conceptual faults: (1) It implies a lattice microstructure; (2) its particle–skipping interactions are a fiction; (4) it ignores shear-resisted particle rotations (which are what lends the lattice discrete particle model (LDPM) its superior performance); (3) its representation of the boundaries, especially the crack and fracture process zone faces, is physically unrealistic; and (5) it cannot reproduce the transitional size effect—a quintessential characteristic of quasibrittleness. The misleading practice of “verifying” a model with only one or two simple tests matchable by many different models, or showcasing an ad hoc improvement for one type of test while ignoring misfits of others, is pointed out. In closing, the ubiquity of crack-parallel stresses in practical problems of concrete, shale, fiber composites, plastic-hardening metals, and materials on submicrometer scale is emphasized.</jats:p>},

@article{OnTheCrackExErdoga1963,
  abstract = {<jats:p>The crack extension in a large plate subjected to general plane loading is examined theoretically and experimentally. It is found that under skew-symmetric plane loading of brittle materials the “sliding” or the crack extension in its own plane does not take place, instead crack grows in the direction approximately 70 deg from the plane of the crack. This is very nearly the direction perpendicular to the maximum tangential stress at the crack tip, which is 70.5 deg. The hypothesis that the crack will grow in the direction perpendicular to the largest tension at the crack tip seems to be verified also by cracked plates under combined tension and shear. In spite of the fact that “sliding” and “tearing” modes of crack extension do not take place in brittle materials it is shown that one can still talk about critical stress intensity factors in plane shear and transverse bending of plates. It is also shown that, in general plane loading, the fracture criterion in terms of stress intensity factors is an ellipse.</jats:p>},

  abstract = {<jats:p>The J-integral that determines the driving force on a crack tip is a central concept of fracture mechanics. It is particularly useful since it is path independent in homogeneous materials. However, most materials are heterogeneous at a microscopic scale, and the J-integral is not necessarily path independent in heterogeneous media. In this paper, we prove the existence of an effective J-integral in heterogeneous media, show that it can be computed from the knowledge of the macroscopic or homogenized displacement fields and that it is path independent in macroscopically homogeneous media as long as the contours are large compared to the length scale of the heterogeneities. This result justifies the common engineering use of the J-integral.</jats:p>},

The discrete formulation derives from the Hellinger-Reissner variational principle with the addition of stabilization terms analogous to those previously considered by others for the Navier-Stokes equations and a scalar Poisson equation. For our formulation, we first obtain convergence in a mesh-dependent norm and in the natural mesh-independent BD norm. We then prove a generalization of Korn's second inequality which allows us to strengthen our results to an optimal, mesh-independent BV estimate for the error. }},

@article{ARobustErrorXuSh2014,
  abstract = {<jats:p>Surrogate models are widely used in simulation-based engineering design and optimization to save the computing cost. The choice of sampling approach has a great impact on the metamodel accuracy. This article presents a robust error-pursuing sequential sampling approach called cross-validation (CV)-Voronoi for global metamodeling. During the sampling process, CV-Voronoi uses Voronoi diagram to partition the design space into a set of Voronoi cells according to existing points. The error behavior of each cell is estimated by leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation approach. Large prediction error indicates that the constructed metamodel in this Voronoi cell has not been fitted well and, thus, new points should be sampled in this cell. In order to rapidly improve the metamodel accuracy, the proposed approach samples a Voronoi cell with the largest error value, which is marked as a sensitive region. The sampling approach exploits locally by the identification of sensitive region and explores globally with the shift of sensitive region. Comparative results with several sequential sampling approaches have demonstrated that the proposed approach is simple, robust, and achieves the desired metamodel accuracy with fewer samples, that is needed in simulation-based engineering design problems.</jats:p>},

@article{CrackPathSelectionAndrews2022,
  abstract = {This work presents a critical overview of the effects of different aspects of model formulation on crack path selection in quasi-static phase field fracture. We consider different evolution methods, mechanics formulations, fracture dissipation energy formulations, and forms of the irreversibility condition. The different model variants are implemented with common numerical methods based on staggered solution of the phase-field and mechanics sub-problems via FFT-based solvers. These methods mix standard approaches with novel elements, such as the use of bound-constrained conjugate gradients for the phase field sub-problem and a heuristic method for near-equilibrium evolution. We examine differences in crack paths between model variants in simple model systems and microstructures with randomly heterogeneous Young's modulus. Our results indicate that near-equilibrium evolution methods are preferable for quasi-static fracture of heterogeneous microstructures compared to minimization and time-dependent methods. In examining mechanics formulations, we find distinct effects of crack driving force and the model for contact implicit in phase field fracture. Our results favor the use of a strain-spectral decomposition for the crack driving force but not the contact model. Irreversibility condition and fracture dissipation energy formulation were also found to affect crack path selection, but systematic effects were difficult to deduce due to the overall sensitivity of crack selection within the heterogeneous microstructures. Our findings support the use of the AT1 model over the AT2 model and irreversibility of the phase field within a crack set rather than the entire domain. Sensitivity to these differences in formulation was reduced but not eliminated by reducing the crack width parameter $\ell$ relative to the size scale of the random microstructures.},

  abstract = {<jats:p> In its numerical implementation, the variational approach to brittle fracture approximates the crack evolution in an elastic solid through the use of gradient damage models. In this article, we first formulate the quasi-static evolution problem for a general class of such damage models. Then, we introduce a stability criterion in terms of the positivity of the second derivative of the total energy under the unilateral constraint induced by the irreversibility of damage. These concepts are applied in the particular setting of a one-dimensional traction test. We construct homogeneous as well as localized damage solutions in a closed form and illustrate the concepts of loss of stability, of scale effects, of damage localization, and of structural failure. Considering several specific constitutive models, stress—displacement curves, stability diagrams, and energy dissipation provide identification criteria for the relevant material parameters, such as limit stress and internal length. Finally, the 1D analytical results are compared with the numerical solution of the evolution problem in a 2D setting. </jats:p>},

               <jats:p>A substantial fraction of the mysteries associated with crack extension might be eliminated if the description of fracture experiments could include some reasonable estimate of the stress conditions near the leading edge of a crack particularly at points of onset of rapid fracture and at points of fracture arrest. It is pointed out that for somewhat brittle tensile fractures in situations such that a generalized plane-stress or a plane-strain analysis is appropriate, the influence of the test configuration, loads, and crack length upon the stresses near an end of the crack may be expressed in terms of two parameters. One of these is an adjustable uniform stress parallel to the direction of a crack extension. It is shown that the other parameter, called the stress-intensity factor, is proportional to the square root of the force tending to cause crack extension. Both factors have a clear interpretation and field of usefulness in investigations of brittle-fracture mechanics.</jats:p>},

  abstract = {Importance sampling is widely used in machine learning and statistics, but its power is limited by the restriction of using simple proposals for which the importance weights can be tractably calculated. We address this problem by studying black-box importance sampling methods that calculate importance weights for samples generated from any unknown proposal or black-box mechanism. Our method allows us to use better and richer proposals to solve difficult problems, and (somewhat counter-intuitively) also has the additional benefit of improving the estimation accuracy beyond typical importance sampling. Both theoretical and empirical analyses are provided.},

@article{ApplicationOfMayer1996,
  abstract = {Abstract The topological optimization of components to maximize crash energy absorption for a given volume is considered. The crash analysis is performed using a DYNA3D finite element analysis. The original solid elements are replaced by ones with holes, the hole size being characterized by a so-called density (measure of the reduced volume). A homogenization method is used to find elastic moduli as a function of this density. Simpler approximations were developed to find plastic moduli and yield stress as functions of density. Optimality criteria were derived from an optimization statement using densities as the design variables. A resizing algorithm was constructed so that the optimality criteria are approximately satisfied. A novel feature is the introduction of an objective function based on strain energies weighted at specified times. Each different choice of weighting factors leads to a different structure, allowing a range of design possibilities to be explored. The method was applied to an automotive body rear rail. The original design and a new design of equal volume with holes were compared for energy absorption.},

@article{APathIndependRice1968,
  abstract = {<jats:p>A line integral is exhibited which has the same value for all paths surrounding the tip of a notch in the two-dimensional strain field of an elastic or deformation-type elastic-plastic material. Appropriate integration path choices serve both to relate the integral to the near tip deformations and, in many cases, to permit its direct evaluation. This averaged measure of the near tip field leads to approximate solutions for several strain-concentration problems. Contained perfectly plastic deformation near a crack tip is analyzed for the plane-strain case with the aid of the slip-line theory. Near tip stresses are shown to be significantly elevated by hydrostatic tension, and a strain singularity results varying inversely with distance from the tip in centered fan regions above and below the tip. Approximate estimates are given for the strain intensity, plastic zone size, and crack tip opening displacement, and the important role of large geometry changes in crack blunting is noted. Another application leads to a general solution for crack tip separations in the Barenblatt-Dugdale crack model. A proof follows on the equivalence of the Griffith energy balance and cohesive force theories of elastic brittle fracture, and hardening behavior is included in a model for plane-stress yielding. A final application leads to approximate estimates of strain concentrations at smooth-ended notch tips in elastic and elastic-plastic materials.</jats:p>},

The inadequacy of the standard first-order computational homogenization scheme, by virtue of lack of the requisite length scale to model such size effects, necessitates enhancements to the standard scheme. In this work, a thorough assessment of one such extension based on the idea of <jats:italic>interface energetics</jats:italic> is conducted. Systematic numerical experimentation and analysis demonstrate the limitation of the aforementioned approach in modeling mechanical behavior of composite materials where the filler material is much stiffer than the matrix. An alternative approach based on the idea of <jats:italic>continuously graded interphases</jats:italic> is introduced. Comprehensive evaluation of this technique by means of representative numerical examples reveals it to be the appropriate one for modeling nano-composite materials with different filler-matrix stiffness combinations.</jats:p>},

Our approach is based on the abstract theory of generalized gradient flows in metric spaces, and comparison with other notions of solutions is given.},

@article{TheReparamTrickWilson2017,
  abstract = {Bayesian optimization is a sample-efficient approach to solving global optimization problems. Along with a surrogate model, this approach relies on theoretically motivated value heuristics (acquisition functions) to guide the search process. Maximizing acquisition functions yields the best performance; unfortunately, this ideal is difficult to achieve since optimizing acquisition functions per se is frequently non-trivial. This statement is especially true in the parallel setting, where acquisition functions are routinely non-convex, high-dimensional, and intractable. Here, we demonstrate how many popular acquisition functions can be formulated as Gaussian integrals amenable to the reparameterization trick and, ensuingly, gradient-based optimization. Further, we use this reparameterized representation to derive an efficient Monte Carlo estimator for the upper confidence bound acquisition function in the context of parallel selection.},

@article{BayesianOptHighDimWesley2021,
  abstract = {Bayesian Optimization is a sample-efficient black-box optimization procedure that is typically applied to problems with a small number of independent objectives. However, in practice we often wish to optimize objectives defined over many correlated outcomes (or "tasks"). For example, scientists may want to optimize the coverage of a cell tower network across a dense grid of locations. Similarly, engineers may seek to balance the performance of a robot across dozens of different environments via constrained or robust optimization. However, the Gaussian Process (GP) models typically used as probabilistic surrogates for multi-task Bayesian Optimization scale poorly with the number of outcomes, greatly limiting applicability. We devise an efficient technique for exact multi-task GP sampling that combines exploiting Kronecker structure in the covariance matrices with Matheron's identity, allowing us to perform Bayesian Optimization using exact multi-task GP models with tens of thousands of correlated outputs. In doing so, we achieve substantial improvements in sample efficiency compared to existing approaches that only model aggregate functions of the outcomes. We demonstrate how this unlocks a new class of applications for Bayesian Optimization across a range of tasks in science and engineering, including optimizing interference patterns of an optical interferometer with more than 65,000 outputs.},

  abstract = {In this work we present the design of a new test geometry inspired by the Tapered Double Cantilever Beam (TDCB) specimen that is shown to provide an improved characterization of the fracture properties of brittle solids. First, we show that our new design results in an exponential increase of the specimen compliance with crack length, leading to an extremely stable crack growth during the test. We determine an analytical description of this behavior, which provides a simple procedure to extract the fracture energy without depending on finite element calculations. Validation tests are done on polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) specimens. We use both finite element simulations and our analytical model to interpret the data. We find a very good agreement between the toughness determined by both methods. The stable nature of crack growth in our improved TDCB specimens results in a precise control of the crack speed. This feature is employed to go one step further and characterize the variations of toughness with crack speed. We propose an original optimization procedure for the determination of the material parameters characterizing the kinetic law describing the toughness rate dependency. Overall, the approach proposed together with the newly designed test geometry offer unprecedented possibilities for the full and accurate characterization of the fracture behavior of brittle materials such as rocks, sandstone, mortar etc.},

  abstract = {Abstract We introduce an extension of current technologies for topology optimization of continuum structures which allows for treating local stress criteria. We first consider relevant stress criteria for porous composite materials, initially by studying the stress states of the so-called rank 2 layered materials. Then, on the basis of the theoretical study of the rank 2 microstructures, we propose an empirical model that extends the power penalized stiffness model (also called SIMP for Solid Isotropic Microstructure with Penalization for inter-mediate densities). In a second part, solution aspects of topology problems are considered. To deal with the so-called ‘singularity’ phenomenon of stress constraints in topology design, an ϵ-constraint relaxation of the stress constraints is used. We describe the mathematical programming approach that is used to solve the numerical optimization problems, and show results for a number of example applications. © 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>We develop a novel unfitted finite element solver for composite materials with quasi-1D fibrous reinforcements. The method belongs to the class of mixed-dimensional non-conforming finite element solvers. The fibres are treated as 1D structural elements that may intersect the mesh of the embedding structure in an arbitrary manner. No meshing of the unidimensional elements is required. Instead, fibre solution fields are described using the trace of the background mesh. A regularised “cut” finite element formulation is carefully designed to ensure that analyses using such non-conforming finite element descriptions are stable. We also design a dedicated primal/dual operator splitting scheme to resolve the coupling between structure and fibrous reinforcements efficiently. The novel computational strategy is applied to the solution of stiff computational models whereby fibrous reinforcements may lose their bond to the embedding material above a certain level of stress. It is shown that the primal-dual 1D/3D CutFEM scheme is convergent and well-behaved in variety of scenarios involving such highly nonlinear structural computations.</jats:p>},

  abstract = {<jats:p>This paper evaluates a Successive Response Surface Method (SRSM) specifically developed for simulation‐based design optimization, e.g. that of explicit nonlinear dynamics in crashworthiness design. Linear response surfaces are constructed in a subregion of the design space using a design of experiments approach with a <jats:italic>D</jats:italic>‐optimal experimental design. To converge to an optimum, a domain reduction scheme is utilized. The scheme requires only one user‐defined parameter, namely the size of the initial subregion. During optimization, the size of this region is adapted using a move reversal criterion to counter oscillation and a move distance criterion to gauge accuracy. To test its robustness, the results using the method are compared to SQP results of a selection of the well‐known Hock and Schittkowski problems. Although convergence to a small tolerance is slow when compared to SQP, the SRSM method does remarkably well for these sometimes pathological analytical problems. The second test concerns three engineering problems sampled from the nonlinear structural dynamics field to investigate the method's handling of numerical noise and non‐linearity. It is shown that, despite its simplicity, the SRSM method converges stably and is relatively insensitive to its only user‐required input parameter.</jats:p>},

  abstract = {Forametal reinforced by short, brittle fibres the development of damage by fibre cracking or decohesion is studied, taking into account the interaction between these two types of damage. The metal matrix composite, containing a periodic array of aligned fibres, is represented in terms of a cell model, and solutions for the stress and strain fields are determined numerically. Failure at the interface is modelled in terms of a cohesive zone model that accounts for decohesion by normal separation as well as by tangential separation, whereas fibre fracture is simply represented by a critical value of the average tensile stress on a cross-section. The effect of various material parameters and of the macroscopic stress state on the two types of damage is investigated , together with the subsequent mode of void growth.},

@article{CompositeLaminTabiei2018,
  abstract = {<jats:p>Composite laminate has extensive usage in the aerospace and automotive industries. Thus delamination, one of its most prevalent and challenging failure modes, has attracted substantial research efforts, and lead to the rapid development of both simulation and experiment method. Although reviews exist about simulation and experiment methods, there are not many that cover the development in the last five years. This paper is targeted to fill that gap. We covered a broad range of topic in delamination, from the basic delamination onset and propagation theories to complex loading scenarios, like impact and fatigue loading. From a simulation point of view, virtual crack closure technique (VCCT) and cohesive zone model (CZM), the two most famous methods of delamination modeling, are compared and elaborated. Their implementation techniques are described, and their merits and drawbacks are discussed. We also covered the failure mode of combined delamination and matrix cracking, which is prevalent in impact loading scenarios. Simulation techniques, along with the failure mechanisms, are presented. From experiment point of view, the discussed topics range from delamination fracture toughness (DFT) tests under static, dynamic, or cyclic loading conditions, to impact tests that aim to obtain the impact resistance and residual strength after impact. Moreover, a collection of recent experiment data is provided.</jats:p>},

@inproceedings{BayesianOptGardner2014,
  abstract = {Bayesian optimization is a powerful framework for minimizing expensive objective functions while using very few function evaluations. It has been successfully applied to a variety of problems, including hyperparameter tuning and experimental design. However, this framework has not been extended to the inequality-constrained optimization setting, particularly the setting in which evaluating feasibility is just as expensive as evaluating the objective. Here we present constrained Bayesian optimization, which places a prior distribution on both the objective and the constraint functions. We evaluate our method on simulated and real data, demonstrating that constrained Bayesian optimization can quickly find optimal and feasible points, even when small feasible regions cause standard methods to fail.},

@article{TheParallelKGFrazier2016,
  abstract = {In many applications of black-box optimization, one can evaluate multiple points simultaneously, e.g. when evaluating the performances of several different neural network architectures in a parallel computing environment. In this paper, we develop a novel batch Bayesian optimization algorithm --- the parallel knowledge gradient method. By construction, this method provides the one-step Bayes-optimal batch of points to sample. We provide an efficient strategy for computing this Bayes-optimal batch of points, and we demonstrate that the parallel knowledge gradient method finds global optima significantly faster than previous batch Bayesian optimization algorithms on both synthetic test functions and when tuning hyperparameters of practical machine learning algorithms, especially when function evaluations are noisy.},

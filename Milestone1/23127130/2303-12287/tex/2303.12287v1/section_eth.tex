Recall that Corollary \ref{cor:markov-formal-ppad} states that if $\PPAD \neq \PP$, then there is no constant $C> 4$ and $\poly(|\MG|)$-time algorithm which solves the $(|\MG|^C, |\MG|^{-1/C})$-\MarkCCE problem for any 2-player Markov game $\MG$. 
Using a stronger complexity-theoretic assumption, the Exponential Time Hypothesis for \PPAD \cite{rubinstein2016settling}, we can obtain a hardness result which rules out efficient algorithms even when 1)  the accuracy $\eps$ is constant, as opposed to being $|\MG|^{-1/C}$, and 2) $T$ is quasipolynomially large, as opposed to only being of polynomial size, i.e., $|\MG|^C$. 
\begin{corollary}[ETH-hardness of \MarkCCE]
  \label{cor:eth-hardness}
There is a constant $\ep_0 > 0$ such that if there exists an algorithm that solves the $(|\MG|^{o(\log |\MG|)}, \ep_0)$-\MarkCCE problem in $|\MG|^{o(\log |\MG|)}$ time, then the Exponential Time Hypothesis for \PPAD fails to hold.
\end{corollary}
Corollary \ref{cor:eth-hardness}  is an immediate consequence of \cref{thm:markov-formal} and the fact that for some absolute constant $\ep_0 > 0$, there are no polynomial-time algorithms for computing $\ep_0$-Nash equilibria in 2-player normal-form games under the Exponential Time Hypothesis for \PPAD (as shown in \cite{rubinstein2016settling}).

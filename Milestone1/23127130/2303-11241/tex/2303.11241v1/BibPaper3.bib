These new transition data are combined with those previously derived for 12C14N, and applied to the determination of CNO abundances in the solar photosphere and in four red giant stars: Arcturus, the bright, very low-metallicity star HD 122563, and the carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars HD 196944 and HD 201626. When both red and violet system lines are detectable in a star, their derived N abundances are in good agreement. The mean N abundances determined in this work are also generally in accord with published values.}

        atmospheres constitutes a challenging astrophysical problem.
        This paper is intended to deepen our understanding of how atomic
        diffusion affects the atmospheric structure of magnetic ApBp
        stars, and in particular how time-dependent calculations may be
        compared to the alternative method of estimating equilibrium
        stratifications. Our numerical calculations - with the stellar
        atmosphere adjusted self-consistently to the abundance profiles
        - show that final stationary solutions of the time-dependent
        diffusion problem (constant particle flux throughout the stellar
        atmosphere) are seemingly at variance with equilibrium
        stratifications (zero particle flux). In this work, we will
        provide some understanding of the origin of these differences
        and try to elucidate the as yet little explored behaviour of
        time-dependent atomic diffusion. To this purpose, we assess the
        influence of the boundary condition at the bottom of the
        atmosphere, we investigate how the stratifications depend on
        magnetic field angle and strength, and we have a look at
        possible interactions between different chemical elements. Based
        on a grid of atmospheric models and stratifications reflecting
        dipolar magnetic geometries, we also present predicted line
        profiles for different oblique rotator models. Finally, we
        shortly discuss the consequences of our findings for the
        interpretation of abundance maps of magnetic ApBp stars.}",

    abstract = "{High-resolution spectropolarimetric observations of the strongly magnetic, superslowly rotating rapidly oscillating Ap star HD 166473 are used to investigate the implications of the presence of a variable strong magnetic field on the vertical and surface horizontal distribution of various chemical elements. The analysis of the calculated least-squares deconvolution Stokes I and V profiles confirms the previously reported detection of non-uniform horizontal surface distribution of several chemical elements. To test the vertical abundance stratification of iron peak and rare earth elements, magnetic field measurements were carried out using spectral lines of these elements belonging to neutral and ionized stages. We find clear indication of the existence of a relation between the magnetic field strength and its orientation and vertical element stratification: magnetic field values obtained for elements in different stages close to the magnetic equator are rather similar, whereas the dispersion in field strengths is remarkably large in the regions close to magnetic field poles. At the phases of negative and positive extrema the mean longitudinal field strength determined from the analysis of the rare-earth element lines is usually stronger than when using Fe and Cr. The strongest mean longitudinal magnetic field, up to −4160 ± 226 G, is detected using the La ii line list at the negative extremum, followed by the measurements using the Pr iii lines with 〈Bz〉=−3740 ± 343 G and the Ce ii lines with 〈Bz〉 = −3372 ± 247 G. The strongest mean longitudinal magnetic field of positive polarity, up to 3584 ± 354 G is detected using the Pr iii lines, followed by the measurement 〈Bz〉 = 2517 ± 249 G using the Ce ii lines.}",

        spectroscopic data are concentrated at infrared and visible
        wavelengths, ultraviolet transitions are being increasingly

        the database comes from the ExoMol project which primarily uses
        theoretical methods, albeit usually fine-tuned to reproduce
        laboratory spectra, to generate very extensive line lists for
        studies of hot bodies. The data have recently been supplemented
        by line lists derived from direct laboratory observations,

     abstract = "{Context. The discovery of Proxima b marked one of the most important
        milestones in exoplanetary science in recent years. Yet the
        limited precision of the available radial velocity data and the
        difficulty in modelling the stellar activity calls for a
        confirmation of the Earth-mass planet. \textbackslash Aims: We
        aim to confirm the presence of Proxima b using independent
        measurements obtained with the new ESPRESSO spectrograph, and
        refine the planetary parameters taking advantage of its improved
        precision. \textbackslash Methods: We analysed 63 spectroscopic
        ESPRESSO observations of Proxima (Gl 551) taken during 2019. We
        obtained radial velocity measurements with a typical radial
        velocity photon noise of 26 cm s$^{-1}$. We combined these data
        with archival spectroscopic observations and newly obtained
        photometric measurements to model the stellar activity signals
        and disentangle them from planetary signals in the radial
        velocity (RV) data. We ran a joint Markov chain Monte Carlo
        analysis on the time series of the RV and full width half
        maximum of the cross-correlation function to model the planetary
        and stellar signals present in the data, applying Gaussian
        process regression to deal with the stellar activity signals.
        \textbackslash Results: We confirm the presence of Proxima b
        independently in the ESPRESSO data and in the combined ESPRESSO+
        HARPS+UVES dataset. The ESPRESSO data on its own shows Proxima b
        at a period of 11.218 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.029 days, with a
        minimum mass of 1.29 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.13
        M$_{{\ensuremath{\oplus}}}$. In the combined dataset we measure
        a period of 11.18427 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.00070 days with a
        minimum mass of 1.173 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.086
        M$_{{\ensuremath{\oplus}}}$. We get a clear measurement of the
        stellar rotation period (87 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 12 d) and its
        induced RV signal, but no evidence of stellar activity as a
        potential cause for the 11.2 days signal. We find some evidence
        for the presence of a second short-period signal, at 5.15 days
        with a semi-amplitude of only 40 cm s$^{-1}$. If caused by a
        planetary companion, it would correspond to a minimum mass of
        0.29 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.08 M$_{{\ensuremath{\oplus}}}$. We
        find that forthe case of Proxima, the full width half maximum of
        the cross-correlation function can be used as a proxy for the
        brightness changes and that its gradient with time can be used
        to successfully detrend the RV data from part of the influence
        of stellar activity. The activity-induced RV signal in the
        ESPRESSO data shows a trend in amplitude towards redder
        wavelengths. Velocities measured using the red end of the
        spectrograph are less affected by activity, suggesting that the
        stellar activity is spot dominated. This could be used to create
        differential RVs that are activity dominated and can be used to
        disentangle activity-induced and planetary-induced signals. The
        data collected excludes the presence of extra companions with
        masses above 0.6 M$_{{\ensuremath{\oplus}}}$ at periods shorter
        than 50 days. \textbackslash\textbackslashThe data used in this

        873 (EV Lac). High-resolution (R = 120,000), low-noise
        (\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde0.5\%) spectra show clear
        Zeeman-shifted sigma components from which we infer field
        strengths of 2--4 kG, independent of uncertainties in model
        atmospheres. Similar observations of a sequence (M0 V--M5 V) of
        low-activity M dwarfs demonstrate that the wing components in
        the 8468.40 A line are not due to the ubiquitous TiO lines in
        the vicinity. This strongly suggests that discrepancies in the
        shape of the magnetically sensitive iron line are due to
        magnetic fields rather than differences in photospheric
        temperature. By fitting the ratio of active to inactive line
        profiles with simple one-component models, we estimate that 50
        +/- 13\% of the photosphere of EV Lac is covered by 3.8 +/- 0.5
        kG magnetic fields, while 50 +/- 13\% of Gliese 729 is covered
        by 2.6 +/- 0.3 kG fields. This confirms earlier reports of large
        magnetic fields on M dwarf flare stars. We see evidence for a
        distribution of magnetic field strength, spatially across the
        surface and/or with depth. The twofold increase in field
        strength relative to G and K dwarfs is predicted by flux tube
        equilibrium arguments, but the 1 kG difference in the measured
        field strengths for these two stars suggests that field
        strengths may also grow with activity as the photospheric
        filling factor approaches unity.}",

        absorption lines in the 4400-4600 per cm region have been
        modeled, and it is inferred that 73 percent + or - 6 percent of
        the surface of AD Leo is covered by active regions outside of
        dark spots containing a mean field strength of 3800 + or - 260
        G. If these active regions are brighter than the quiet
        photosphere, the surface filling factor will be somewhat
        smaller. Since simultaneous H-alpha observations exhibited no
        evidence of flares, the observations probably represent the
        quiescent magnetic flux level. The inferred field strength is
        consistent with equipartition of magnetic and thermal pressures
        in the photosphere and is similar to values derived using the

        September 18 to November 14. Our radial velocity (RV) time-
        series exhibits activity-induced fluctuations of 45 m s$^{-1}$
        rms, {\ensuremath{\sim}}3 times smaller than those measured in
        the optical domain, that we filter using Gaussian Process
        Regression. We report a 3.9{\ensuremath{\sigma}} detection of
        the recently discovered 8.46 -d transiting planet AU Mic b, with
        an estimated mass of 17.1 $^{+4.7}_{-4.5}$
        M$_{{\ensuremath{\oplus}}}$ and a bulk density of 1.3
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.4 g cm$^{-3}$, inducing an RV signature of
        semi-amplitude K = 8.5 $^{+2.3}_{-2.2}$ m s$^{-1}$ in the
        spectrum of its host star. A consistent detection is
        independently obtained when we simultaneously image stellar
        surface inhomogeneities and estimate the planet parameters with
        Zeeman-Doppler imaging (ZDI). Using ZDI, we invert the time-
        series of unpolarized and circularly polarized spectra into
        surface brightness and large-scale magnetic maps. We find a
        mainly poloidal and axisymmetric field of 475 G, featuring, in
        particular, a dipole of 450 G tilted at 19{\textdegree} to the
        rotation axis. Moreover, we detect a strong differential
        rotation of d{\ensuremath{\Omega}} = 0.167 {\ensuremath{\pm}}
        0.009 rad d$^{-1}$ shearing the large-scale field, about twice
        stronger than that shearing the brightness distribution,
        suggesting that both observables probe different layers of the
        convective zone. Even though we caution that more RV
        measurements are needed to accurately pin down the planet mass,
        AU Mic b already appears as a prime target for constraining
        planet formation models, studying the interactions with the
        surrounding debris disc, and characterizing its atmosphere with
        upcoming space- and ground-based missions.}",

        ZDI) can be used to characterize stellar activity and magnetic
        field topologies, ultimately allowing us to filter out the
        radial velocity (RV) activity jitter of M dwarf moderate
        rotators. This work is based on spectropolarimetric observations
        of a sample of five weakly active early-M dwarfs (GJ 205, GJ
        358, GJ 410, GJ 479, GJ 846) with HARPS-Pol and NARVAL. These
        stars have v sin I and RV jitters in the range 1-2 km s$^{-1}$
        and 2.7-10.0 m s$^{-1}$ rms, respectively. Using a modified
        version of ZDI applied to sets of phase-resolved least-squares
        deconvolved profiles of unpolarized spectral lines, we are able
        to characterize the distribution of active regions at the
        stellar surfaces. We find that dark spots cover less than 2 per
        cent of the total surface of the stars of our sample. Our
        technique is efficient at modelling the rotationally modulated
        component of the activity jitter, and succeeds at decreasing the
        amplitude of this component by typical factors of 2-3 and up to
        6 in optimal cases. From the rotationally modulated time series
        of circularly polarized spectra and with ZDI, we also
        reconstruct the large-scale magnetic field topology. These
        fields suggest that bistability of dynamo processes observed in
        active M dwarfs may also be at work for moderately active M
        dwarfs. Comparing spot distributions with field topologies
        suggest that dark spots causing activity jitter concentrate at
        the magnetic pole and/or equator, to be confirmed with future
        data on a larger sample.}",

	Abstract = {{The surface rotation rates of young solar-type stars vary rapidly with
        age from the end of the pre-main sequence through the early main
        sequence. Important changes in the dynamos operating in these
        stars may result from this evolution, which should be observable
        in their surface magnetic fields. Here we present a study aimed
        at observing the evolution of these magnetic fields through this
        critical time period. We observed stars in open clusters and
        stellar associations of known ages, and used Zeeman Doppler
        imaging to characterize their complex magnetic large-scale
        fields. Presented here are results for 15 stars, from five
        associations, with ages from 20 to 250 Myr, masses from 0.7 to
        1.2 M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$, and rotation periods from 0.4 to
        6 d. We find complex large-scale magnetic field geometries, with
        global average strengths from 14 to 140 G. There is a clear
        trend towards decreasing average large-scale magnetic field
        strength with age, and a tight correlation between magnetic
        field strength and Rossby number. Comparing the magnetic
        properties of our zero-age main-sequence sample to those of both
        younger and older stars, it appears that the magnetic evolution
        of solar-type stars during the pre-main sequence is primarily
        driven by structural changes, while it closely follows the
        stars' rotational evolution on the main sequence.}},

        sample. The three nearest systems that had no previous
        trigonometric parallaxes (other than perhaps rough preliminary
        efforts) are SO 0253+1652 (3.84+/-0.04 pc, the 23rd nearest
        system), SCR 1845-6357 AB (3.85+/-0.02 pc, 24th nearest), and
        LHS 1723 (5.32+/-0.04 pc, 56th nearest). In total, seven of the
        systems reported here rank among the nearest 100 stellar
        systems. Supporting photometric and spectroscopic observations
        have been made to provide full characterization of the systems,
        including complete VRIJHK$_{s}$ photometry and spectral types. A
        study of the variability of 27 targets reveals six obvious
        variable stars, including GJ 1207, for which we observed a flare
        event in the V band that caused it to brighten by 1.7 mag.
        Improved parallaxes for GJ 54 AB and GJ 1061, both important

        have been reported to be within 10 pc, indicate that they are
        beyond 10 pc. From the analysis of systems with (previously)
        high trigonometric parallax errors, we conclude that parallaxes
        with errors in excess of 10 mas are insufficiently reliable for
        inclusion in the RECONS sample. The cumulative total of new
        additions to the 10 pc sample since 2000 is now 34 systems: 28

     abstract = "{Context. Magnetic fields in cool stars can be investigated by measuring
        Zeeman line broadening and polarization in atomic and molecular
        lines. Similar to the Sun, these fields are complex and height-
        dependent. Many molecular lines dominating M-dwarf spectra
        (e.g., FeH, CaH, MgH, and TiO) are temperature- and Zeeman-
        sensitive and form at different atmospheric heights, which makes
        them excellent probes of magnetic fields on M dwarfs.
        \textbackslash Aims: Our goal is to analyze the complexity of
        magnetic fields in M dwarfs. We investigate how magnetic fields
        vary with the stellar temperature and how ``surface''
        inhomogeneities are distributed in height - the dimension that
        is usually neglected in stellar magnetic studies. \textbackslash
        Methods: We have determined effective temperatures of the
        photosphere and of magnetic features, magnetic field strengths
        and filling factors for nine M dwarfs (M1-M7). Our
        {\ensuremath{\chi}}$^{2}$ analysis is based on a comparison of
        observed and synthetic intensity and circular polarization
        profiles. Stokes profiles were calculated by solving polarized
        radiative transfer equations. \textbackslash Results: Properties
        of magnetic structures depend on the analyzed atomic or
        molecular species and their formation heights. Two types of
        magnetic features similar to those on the Sun have been found: a
        cooler (starspots) and a hotter (network) one. The magnetic
        field strength in both starspots and network is within 3-6 kG,
        on average it is 5 kG. These fields occupy a large fraction of M
        dwarf atmospheres at all heights, up to 100\%. The plasma
        {\ensuremath{\beta}} is less than one, implying highly
        magnetized stars. \textbackslash Conclusions: A combination of
        molecular and atomic species and a simultaneous analysis of
        intensity and circular polarization spectra have allowed us to
        better decipher the complexity of magnetic fields on M dwarfs,
        including their dependence on the atmospheric height. This work
        provides an opportunity to investigate a larger sample of M
        dwarfs and L-type brown dwarfs. \textbackslash\textbackslashThe

        for. \textbackslash Aims: The goals of this manuscript are to
        (i) present a new data reduction software for HARPS-N, (ii)
        demonstrate the improvement brought by this new software during
        the first three years of the HARPS-N solar data set, and (iii)
        release all the obtained solar products, from extracted spectra
        to precise radial velocities. \textbackslash Methods: To correct
        for the instrumental systematics observed in the data reduced
        with the current version of the HARPS-N data reduction software
        (DRS version 3.7), we adapted the newly available ESPRESSO DRS
        (version 2.2.3) to HARPS-N and developed new optimised recipes
        for the spectrograph. We then compared the first three years of
        HARPS-N solar data reduced with the current and new DRS.
        \textbackslash Results: The most significant improvement brought
        by the new DRS is a strong decrease in the day-to-day radial-
        velocity scatter, from 1.27 to 1.07 m s$^{{\ensuremath{-}}1}$;
        this is thanks to a more robust method to derive wavelength
        solutions, but also to the use of calibrations closer in time.
        The newly derived solar radial-velocities are also better
        correlated with the chromospheric activity level of the Sun in
        the long term, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.93
        compared to 0.77 before, which is expected from our
        understanding of stellar signals. Finally, we also discuss how
        HARPS-N spectral ghosts contaminate the measurement of the
        calcium activity index, and we present an efficient technique to
        derive an index free of instrumental systematics. \textbackslash
        Conclusions: This paper presents a new data reduction software
        for HARPS-N and demonstrates its improvements, mainly in terms
        of radial-velocity precision, when applied to the first three
        years of the HARPS-N solar data set. Those newly reduced solar
        data, representing an unprecedented time series of 34 550 high-
        resolution spectra and precise radial velocities, are released
        alongside this paper. Those data are crucial to understand
        stellar activity signals in solar-type stars further and develop
        the mitigating techniques that will allow us to detect other
        Earths. \textbackslash\textbackslashThe thorium line list

	Abstract = {{Context. Stellar activity limits the radial velocity (RV) search and
        characterisation of exoplanets, as it introduces spurious noise
        (called jitter) in the data sets and prevents the correct
        retrieval of a planetary signal. This is key for M dwarfs,
        considering that they manifest high activity levels and are
        primary targets for present and future searches of habitable
        Earth-like planets. To perform precise RV measurements, multi-
        line numerical techniques like cross-correlation and least-
        squares deconvolution (LSD) are typically employed.
        \textbackslash Aims: Effective filtering of activity is crucial
        to achieving the sensitivity required for small planet
        detections. Here we analyse the impact of selecting different
        line lists for LSD on the dispersion in our RV data sets, to
        identify the line list that most effectively reduces the jitter.
        \textbackslash Methods: We employ optical spectropolarimetric
        observations of the active M dwarf EV Lac collected with
        ESPaDOnS and NARVAL, and study two line down-selection
        approaches: a parametric method based on line properties (depth,
        wavelength, magnetic sensitivity) and a randomised algorithm
        that samples the line combination space. We test the latter
        further to find the line list that singles out the activity
        signal from other sources of noise, and on AD Leo and DS Leo to
        examine its consistency at mitigating jitter for different
        activity levels. The analysis is complemented with planetary
        injection tests. \textbackslash Results: The parametric
        selection yields a RV RMS reduction of less than 10\%, while the
        randomised selection yields a systematic improvement (>50\%)
        regardless of the activity level of the star examined.
        Furthermore, if activity is the dominant source of noise, this
        approach allows the construction of lists containing mainly
        activity-sensitive lines, which could be used to enhance the
        rotational modulation of the resulting data sets and determine
        the stellar rotation period more robustly. Finally, the output
        line lists allow the recovery of a synthetic planet (0.3-0.6
        M$_{Jup}$ on a 10 d orbit) in the presence of both moderate (20
        m s$^{{\ensuremath{-}}1}$ semi-amplitude) and high (200 m
        s$^{{\ensuremath{-}}1}$) activity levels, without substantially
        affecting the planet signal (between 60 and 120 m
        s$^{{\ensuremath{-}}1}$).}},

@article{maldonado_2020,
	Abstract = {{Context. Most of our current knowledge on planet formation is still
        based on the analysis of main sequence, solar-type stars.
        Conversely, detailed chemical studies of large samples of M
        dwarfs hosting planets are still missing. \textbackslash Aims:
        Correlations exist between the presence of different types of
        planets around FGK stars and metallicity, individual chemical
        abundance, and stellar mass. We aim to test whether or not these
        correlations still hold for the less-massive M dwarf stars.
        Methods to determine stellar abundances of M dwarfs from high-
        resolution optical spectra in a consistent way are still
        missing. The present work is a first attempt to fill this gap.
        \textbackslash Methods: We analyse a large sample of M dwarfs
        with and without known planetary companions in a coherent and
        homogeneous way. We develop for the first time a methodology to
        determine stellar abundances of elements other than iron for M
        dwarf stars from high-resolution optical spectra. Our
        methodology is based on the use of a principal component
        analysis and sparse Bayesian methods. We made use of a set of M
        dwarfs orbiting around an FGK primary with known abundances to
        train our methods. We applied our methods to derive stellar
        metalliticies and abundances of a large sample of M dwarfs
        observed within the framework of current radial-velocity
        surveys. We then used a sample of nearby FGK stars to cross-
        validate our technique by comparing the derived abundance trends
        in the M dwarf sample with those found on the FGK stars.
        \textbackslash Results: The metallicity distribution of the
        different subsamples reveals a correlation between the
        metallicities of M dwarfs and their probability of hosting giant
        planets. We also find a correlation between this latter
        probability and stellar mass. M dwarfs hosting low-mass planets
        do not seem to follow the so-called planet-metallicity
        correlation. We also find that the frequency of low-mass planets
        does not depend on the mass of the stellar host. These results
        appear to be in agreement with those of previous works. However,
        we note that for giant-planet hosts our metallicities predict a
        weaker planet-host metallicity correlation but a stronger mass-
        dependency than corresponding values derived from photometric
        results. We show for the first time that there seems to be no
        differences between M dwarfs with and without known planets in
        terms of their abundance distributions of elements different
        from iron. \textbackslash Conclusions: Our data show that low-
        mass stars with planets follow the same metallicity, mass, and
        abundance trends as their FGK counterparts, which are usually
        explained within the framework of core-accretion models.

        guaranteed time observations (GTO) Catalog identifies the best
        target stars for a blind search for the radial velocity (RV)
        signals caused by Earth-class exoplanets. \textbackslash
        Methods: Using the most complete stellar catalogs available, we
        screened for the most suitable G, K, and M dwarf stars for the
        detection of Earth-class exoplanets with ESPRESSO. For most of
        the stars, we then gathered high-resolution spectra from new
        observations or from archival data. We used these spectra to
        spectroscopically investigate the existence of any stellar
        binaries, both bound or background stars. We derived the
        activity level using chromospheric activity indexes using log
        (R'$_{HK}$), as well as the projected rotational velocity v sin
        i. For the cases where planet companions are already known, we
        also looked at the possibility that additional planets may exist
        in the host's habitable zone using dynamical arguments.

        contamination level, v sin i, activity, stellar parameters and
        chemical abundances for 249 of the most promising targets. Using
        these data, we selected 45 stars that match our criteria for
        detectability of a planet like Earth. The stars presented and

        fields were measured for the first time. Our measurements are
        consistent with the magnetic field saturation in stars with
        rotation periods P < 4 d. The analysis of the magnetic filling
        factors reveal two different patterns of either very smooth
        distribution or a more patchy one, which can be connected to the
        dynamo state of the stars and/or stellar mass. \textbackslash
        Conclusions: Our measurements extend the list of M dwarfs with
        strong surface magnetic fields. They also allow us to better
        constrain the interplay between the magnetic energy, stellar
        rotation, and underlying dynamo action. The high spectral
        resolution and observations at near-infrared wavelengths are the
        beneficial capabilities of the CARMENES instrument that allow us
        to address important questions about the stellar magnetism.}},

	Abstract = {{Context: A challenge with radial-velocity (RV) data is disentangling the
        origin of signals either due to a planetary companion or to
        stellar activity. In fact, the existence of a planetary
        companion has been proposed, as well as contested, around the
        relatively bright, nearby M3.0V star AD Leo at the same period
        as the stellar rotation of 2.23d. Aims: We further investigate
        the nature of this signal. We introduce new CARMENES optical and
        near-IR RV data and an analysis in combination with archival
        data taken by HIRES and HARPS, along with more recent data from
        HARPS-N, GIANO-B, and HPF. Also, we address the confusion
        concerning the binarity of AD Leo. Methods: We consider possible
        correlations between the RVs and various stellar activity
        indicators accessible with CARMENES. We applied models within a
        Bayesian framework to determine whether a Keplerian model, a
        red-noise quasi-periodic model using a Gaussian process, or a
        mixed model would explain the observed data best. We also
        exclusively focus on spectral lines potentially associated with
        stellar activity. Results: The CARMENES RV data agree with the
        previously reported periodicity of 2.23d, correlate with some
        activity indicators, and exhibit chromaticity. However, when
        considering the entire RV data set, we find that a mixed model
        composed of a stable and a variable component performs best.
        Moreover, when recomputing the RVs using only spectral lines
        insensitive to activity, there appears to be some residual power
        at the period of interest. We therefore conclude that it is not
        possible to determinedly prove that there is no planet orbiting
        in synchronization with the stellar rotation given our data,
        current tools, machinery, and knowledge of how stellar activity
        affects RVs. We do rule out planets more massive than 27M\_E
        (=0.084M\_J). We also exclude any binary companion around AD Leo
        with Msini > 3-6M\_J on orbital periods <14yr.}},

        and rapid rotation. We compare our MIPS observations to
        empirically derived K$_{s}$ -[24] colors as a function of the
        stellar effective temperature to identify 24 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m
        and 70 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m excesses. We place constraints or
        upper limits on dust temperatures and fractional infrared
        luminosities with a simple blackbody dust model. We confirm the
        previously published 70 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m excesses for HD

        measurements for these sources. We present the discovery of 70

        HD 59967, HD 73350, and HD 135599. HD 135599 is also a known
        Spitzer IRS (InfraRed Spectrograph) excess source, and we
        confirm the excess at 24 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m. We also present
        the detection of 24 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m excesses for 10 stars:
        HD 10008, GJ 3400A, HD 73350, HD 112429, HD 123998, HD 175742,
        AT Mic, BO Mic, HD 358623 and Gl 907.1. We find that large 70
        {\ensuremath{\mu}}m excesses are less common around stars with
        effective temperatures of less than 5000 K (3.7$^{+7.6}$
        $_{-1.1}$\%) than around stars with effective temperatures
        between 5000 K and 6000 K (21.4$^{+9.5}$ $_{-5.7}$\%), despite
        the cooler stars having a younger median age in our sample (12
        Myr vs. 340 Myr). We find that the previously reported excess
        for TWA 13A at 70 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m is due to a nearby
        background galaxy, and the previously reported excess for HD
        177724 is due to saturation of the near-infrared photometry used
        to predict the mid-infrared stellar flux contribution. In the

        timescales due to grain-grain collisions and radiation pressure,
        Poynting-Robertson (P-R) drag, stellar wind drag, and planet-
        dust dynamical interaction. We find that drag forces can be
        important for disk dynamics relative to grain-grain collisions
        for L $_{IR}$/L $_{*}$ < 10$^{-4}$, and that stellar wind drag
        is more important than P-R drag for K and M dwarfs, and possibly

        debris disk and one recently discovered planet on an 8d orbit.
        Large-scale structures within the disk were also discovered and
        are moving outward at high velocity. We aim at studying this
        system with the highest spatial resolution in order to probe the
        innermost regions and to search for additional low-mass
        companion or set detection limits. The star was observed with
        two different techniques probing complementary spatial scales.
        We obtained new SAM observations with SPHERE, which we combined
        with data from NACO, PIONIER and GRAVITY. We did not detect
        additional companions within 0.02-7au from the star. We
        determined magnitude upper limits for companions of
        H\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde9.8mag within 0.02-0.5au,
        Ks\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde11.2mag within 0.4-2.4au and
        L'\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde10.7mag within 0.7-7au. Using
        theoretical isochrones, we converted into mass upper limits of
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde17Mjup,
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde12Mjup and
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde9jup, respectively. The PIONIER
        observations allowed us to determine the angular diameter of AU
        Mic, 0.825+/-0.050mas, which converts to R = 0.862+/-0.052Rsun.
        We did not detect the newly discovered planets, but we derived
        upper limit masses for the innermost region of AU Mic. We do not
        have any detection with a significance beyond 3sigma, the most
        significant signal with PIONIER being 2.9sigma and with SPHERE
        being 1.6\textbackslashsigma. We applied the pyMESS2 code to
        estimate the detection probability of companions by combining
        radial velocities, SPHERE imaging and our interferometric
        detection maps. We show that 99\% of the companions down to
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde0.5Mjup can be detected within
        0.02au or 1Mjup down to 0.2au. The low-mass planets orbiting at
        <0.11au will not be directly detectable with the current AO and
        interferometric instruments due to its close orbit and very high
        contrast (\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde10e-10 in K). It will

	Abstract = {{We present the first direct magnetic field measurements on M dwarfs
        cooler than spectral class M4.5. Utilizing a new method based on
        the FeH band near 1 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m, we categorize the
        integrated surface magnetic flux as low (well under 1 kG),
        intermediate (between 1 and about 2.5 kG), or strong (greater
        than about 3 kG) for a set of more than 20 stars ranging from M2
        down to M9. Along with the field, we also measure the rotational
        broadening (vsini) and H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emission strength.
        Our goal is to advance the understanding of how dynamo field
        production varies with stellar parameters for very low mass
        stars, how the field and emission activity are related, and
        whether there is a connection between the rotation and magnetic
        flux. We find that fields are produced throughout the M dwarfs.
        In the mid-M stars, there is a clear connection between slow
        rotation and weak fields. In the late-M stars, rotation is
        always measurable, and the strongest fields are associated with
        with the most rapid rotators. Interestingly, these very cool
        rapid rotators appear to have the largest magnetic flux in the
        whole sample (greater than in the classical dMe stars).
        H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emission is found to be a good proxy for
        magnetic fields, although the relation between the fractional
        emission and the magnetic flux varies with effective
        temperature. The drop-off in this fractional emission near the
        bottom of the main sequence is not accompanied by a drop-off in
        magnetic flux. It is clear that the methodology we have
        developed can be further applied to discover more about the
        behavior of magnetic dynamos and activity in cool and fully
        convective objects.}},

	Abstract = {{We present a spectroscopic analysis of a 1-yr intensive monitoring
        campaign of the 22-Myr old planet-hosting M dwarf AU Mic using
        the HARPS spectrograph. In a companion paper, we reported
        detections of the planet radial velocity (RV) signatures of the
        two close-in transiting planets of the system, with respective
        semi-amplitudes of 5.8 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 2.5 and 8.5
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 2.5 m s$^{-1}$ for AU Mic b and AU Mic c.
        Here, we perform an independent measurement of the RV semi-
        amplitude of AU Mic c using Doppler imaging to simultaneously
        model the activity-induced distortions and the planet-induced
        shifts in the line profiles. The resulting semi-amplitude of
        13.3 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 4.1 m s$^{-1}$ for AU Mic c reinforces
        the idea that the planet features a surprisingly large inner
        density, in tension with current standard models of core
        accretion. Our brightness maps feature significantly higher spot
        coverage and lower level of differential rotation than the
        brightness maps obtained in late 2019 with the SPIRou
        spectropolarimeter, suggesting that the stellar magnetic
        activity has evolved dramatically over a
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde1-yr time span. Additionally, we
        report a 3{\ensuremath{\sigma}} detection of a modulation at
        8.33 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.04 d of the He I D3 (5875.62 {\r{A}})
        emission flux, close to the 8.46-d orbital period of AU Mic b.
        The power of this emission (a few {}10$^{17}$ W) is consistent
        with 3D magnetohydrodynamical simulations of the interaction
        between stellar wind and the close-in planet if the latter hosts
        a magnetic field of \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde10 G.
        Spectropolarimetric observations of the star are needed to
        firmly elucidate the origin of the observed chromospheric

	Abstract = {{AU Microscopii (AU Mic) is a young, active star whose transiting planet
        was recently detected. Here, we report our analysis of its TESS
        light curve, where we modeled the BY Draconis type quasi-
        periodic rotational modulation by starspots simultaneously to
        the flaring activity and planetary transits. We measured a flare
        occurrence rate in AU Mic of 6.35 flares per day for flares with
        amplitudes in the range of 0.06\% < f$_{max}$ < 1.5\% of the
        star flux. We employed a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo
        analysis to model the five transits of AU Mic b observed by
        TESS, improving the constraints on the planetary parameters. The
        measured planet-to-star effective radius ratio of
        R$_{p}${\ensuremath{/}}R$_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ = 0.0496
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.0007 implies a physical radius of 4.07
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.17 R$_{{\ensuremath{\oplus}}}$ and a planet
        density of 1.4 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.4 g
        cm$^{{\ensuremath{-}}3}$, confirming that AU Mic b is a Neptune-
        size moderately inflated planet. While a single feature possibly
        due to a second planet was previously reported in the former
        TESS data, we report the detection of two additional transit-
        like events in the new TESS observations of July 2020. This
        represents substantial evidence for a second planet (AU Mic c)
        in the system. We analyzed its three available transits and
        obtained an orbital period of 18.859019 {\ensuremath{\pm}}
        0.000016 d and a planetary radius of 3.24 {\ensuremath{\pm}}
        0.16 R$_{{\ensuremath{\oplus}}}$, which defines AU Mic c as a
        warm Neptune-size planet with an expected mass in the range of
        2.2 M$_{{\ensuremath{\oplus}}}$ < M$_{c}$ < 25.0
        M$_{{\ensuremath{\oplus}}}$, estimated from the population of
        exoplanets of similar sizes. The two planets in the AU Mic
        system are in near 9:4 mean-motion resonance. We show that this
        configuration is dynamically stable and should produce transit-
        timing variations (TTV). Our non-detection of significant TTV in
        AU Mic b suggests an upper limit for the mass of AU Mic c of <7
        M$_{{\ensuremath{\oplus}}}$, indicating that this planet is also
        likely to be inflated. As a young multi-planet system with at
        least two transiting planets, AU Mic becomes a key system for
        the study of atmospheres of infant planets and of planet-planet
        and planet-disk dynamics at the early stages of planetary
        evolution.}},

	Abstract = {{Context. The nearby and young M star AU Mic is surrounded by a debris
        disk in which we previously identified a series of large-scale
        arch-like structures that have never been seen before in any
        other debris disk and that move outward at high velocities.
        \textbackslash Aims: We initiated a monitoring program with the
        following objectives: (1) track the location of the structures
        and better constrain their projected speeds, (2) search for new
        features emerging closer in, and ultimately (3) understand the
        mechanism responsible for the motion and production of the disk
        features. \textbackslash Methods: AU Mic was observed at 11
        different epochs between August 2014 and October 2017 with the
        IR camera and spectrograph of SPHERE. These high-contrast
        imaging data were processed with a variety of angular, spectral,
        and polarimetric differential imaging techniques to reveal the
        faintest structures in the disk. We measured the projected
        separations of the features in a systematic way for all epochs.
        We also applied the very same measurements to older observations
        from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) with the visible cameras
        STIS and ACS. \textbackslash Results: The main outcomes of this
        work are (1) the recovery of the five southeastern broad arch-
        like structures we identified in our first study, and
        confirmation of their fast motion (projected speed in the range
        4-12 km s$^{-1}$); (2) the confirmation that the very first
        structures observed in 2004 with ACS are indeed connected to
        those observed later with STIS and now SPHERE; (3) the discovery
        of two new very compact structures at the northwest side of the
        disk (at 0.40`` and 0.55'' in May 2015) that move to the
        southeast at low speed; and (4) the identification of a new
        arch-like structure that might be emerging at the southeast side
        at about 0.4`` from the star (as of May 2016). \textbackslash
        Conclusions: Although the exquisite sensitivity of SPHERE allows
        one to follow the evolution not only of the projected
        separation, but also of the specific morphology of each
        individual feature, it remains difficult to distinguish between
        possible dynamical scenarios that may explain the observations.
        Understanding the exact origin of these features, the way they
        are generated, and their evolution over time is certainly a
        significant challenge in the context of planetary system
        formation around M stars. \textbackslash\textbackslashBased on

	Abstract = {{Based on optical high-resolution spectra obtained with CFHT/ESPaDOnS, we
        present new measurements of activity and magnetic field proxies
        of 442 low-mass K5-M7 dwarfs. The objects were analysed as
        potential targets to search for planetary-mass companions with
        the new spectropolarimeter and high-precision velocimeter,
        SPIRou. We have analysed their high-resolution spectra in an
        homogeneous way: circular polarization, chromospheric features
        and Zeeman broadening of the FeH infrared line. The complex
        relationship between these activity indicators is analysed;
        while no strong connection is found between the large-scale and
        small-scale magnetic fields, the latter relates with the non-
        thermal flux originating in the chromosphere. We then examine
        the relationship between various activity diagnostics and the
        optical radial-velocity (RV) jitter available in the literature,
        especially for planet host stars. We use this to derive for all
        stars an activity merit function (higher for quieter stars) with
        the goal of identifying the most favourable stars, where the RV
        jitter is low enough for planet searches. We find that the main
        contributors to the RV jitter are the large-scale magnetic field
        and the chromospheric non-thermal emission. In addition, three
        stars (GJ 1289, GJ 793 and GJ 251) have been followed along
        their rotation using the spectropolarimetric mode, and we derive
        their magnetic topology. These very slow rotators are good
        representatives of future SPIRou targets. They are compared to
        other stars, where the magnetic topology is also known. The
        poloidal component of the magnetic field is predominent in all
        three stars.}},

	Abstract = {{There is a large change in surface rotation rates of sun-like stars on
        the pre-main sequence and early main sequence. Since these stars
        have dynamo-driven magnetic fields, this implies a strong
        evolution of their magnetic properties over this time period.
        The spin-down of these stars is controlled by interactions
        between stellar and magnetic fields, thus magnetic evolution in
        turn plays an important role in rotational evolution. We present
        here the second part of a study investigating the evolution of
        large-scale surface magnetic fields in this critical time
        period. We observed stars in open clusters and stellar
        associations with known ages between 120 and 650 Myr, and used
        spectropolarimetry and Zeeman Doppler Imaging to characterize
        their large-scale magnetic field strength and geometry. We
        report 15 stars with magnetic detections here. These stars have
        masses from 0.8 to 0.95 M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$, rotation
        periods from 0.326 to 10.6 d, and we find large-scale magnetic
        field strengths from 8.5 to 195 G with a wide range of
        geometries. We find a clear trend towards decreasing magnetic
        field strength with age, and a power law decrease in magnetic
        field strength with Rossby number. There is some tentative
        evidence for saturation of the large-scale magnetic field
        strength at Rossby numbers below 0.1, although the saturation
        point is not yet well defined. Comparing to younger classical T
        Tauri stars, we support the hypothesis that differences in

	Abstract = {{Context. Few exoplanets around hot stars with radiative envelopes have
        been discovered, although new observations from the TESS mission
        are improving this. Stars with radiative envelopes have little
        mixing at their surface, and thus their surface abundances
        provide a sensitive test case for a variety of processes,
        including potentially star-planet interactions. Atomic diffusion
        is particularly important in these envelopes, producing
        chemically peculiar objects such as Am and HgMn stars.
        \textbackslash Aims: An exoplanet candidate around the B6 star
        HD 235349 was identified by TESS. Here we determine the nature
        of this transiting object and identify possible chemical
        peculiarities in the star. \textbackslash Methods: HD 235349 was
        observed using the long-slit spectrograph at Tartu Observatory,
        as well as photometrically by the TESS mission. The spectra were
        modeled to determine stellar parameters and chemical abundances.
        The photometric light curve was then analyzed in the context of
        the stellar parameters to determine properties of the transiting
        object. \textbackslash Results: We find the transiting object is
        a low-mass stellar companion, not a planet. However, the primary
        of this eclipsing binary is a rare type of chemically peculiar
        star. A strong overabundance of P is found with overabundances
        of Ne and Nd and mild overabundances of Ti and Mn, while He is
        mildly underabundant. There is also clear evidence for vertical
        stratification of P in the atmosphere of the star. The lack of
        Hg and the weak Mn overabundance suggests that this is not a
        typical HgMn star. It may be in the class of helium-weak
        phosphorus-gallium (He-weak PGa) stars or an intermediate
        between these two classes. \textbackslash Conclusions: We show
        that HD 235349 is a rare type of chemically peculiar star (He-
        weak PGa) in an eclipsing binary system with a low-mass stellar
        companion. This appears to be the first He-weak PGa star

        short orbital separation and host star brightness, 55 Cnc e
        provides one of the best opportunities for studying star-planet
        interactions (SPIs). We aim to understand possible SPIs in this
        system, which requires a detailed understanding of the stellar
        magnetic field and wind impinging on the planet. \textbackslash
        Methods: Using spectropolarimetric observations and Zeeman
        Doppler Imaging, we derived a map of the large-scale stellar
        magnetic field. We then simulated the stellar wind starting from
        the magnetic field map, using a 3D magneto-hydrodynamic model.
        \textbackslash Results: The map of the large-scale stellar
        magnetic field we derive has an average strength of 3.4 G. The
        field has a mostly dipolar geometry; the dipole is tilted by
        90{\textdegree} with respect to the rotation axis and the
        dipolar strength is 5.8 G at the magnetic pole. The wind
        simulations based on this magnetic geometry lead us to conclude
        that 55 Cnc e orbits inside the Alfv{\'e}n surface of the
        stellar wind, implying that effects from the planet on the wind
        can propagate back to the stellar surface and result in SPI.

	Abstract = {{We present an in-depth investigation of the increase in equivalent width
        of saturated lines under the influence of strong magnetic
        fields, aptly called ``magnetic intensification''. Assuming 20
        different Zeeman patterns (with the number of components ranging
        from 3 to 45) for a fictitious Fe II line at 4500 {\r{A}} in a
        10 000 K, log g = 4.0 Kurucz atmosphere, we calculate equivalent
        widths as a function of magnetic field strength, field angle and
        line strength (abundance). The increase over the zero field
        equivalent width is found to always fall below the n/2 relation
        suggested by Babcock (\textbackslashcite\{bab49\}), where n is
        the number of Zeeman components. After a discussion of the
        behaviour of various Zeeman patterns we turn to the influence of
        anomalous dispersion on magnetic intensification. Changes in
        line blanketing due to magnetic desaturation appear to be of
        negligible size. Finally we show that magnetic intensification
        leads to apparent enhanced abundances and to virtual abundance
        variations in magnetic stars with dipolar surface magnetic field
        configurations.}},

	Abstract = {{Context. Observations of the solar atmosphere of ever increasing spatial
        resolution reveal steep gradients in the magnetic field and in
        thermal states. Likewise, numerical simulations of the solar
        atmosphere show contact discontinuities and shock fronts. This
        asks for the development of robust methods for computing the
        radiative transfer of polarized light in discontinuous media.
        \textbackslash Aims: Here, we propose a new concept for dealing
        with discontinuities in the radiative transfer of polarized
        light and carry out a few basic test calculations. While in the
        past, the focus was on interpolating the source function with
        ever-increasing accuracy and smoothness, we propose to take the
        opposite approach by reconstructing it with piecewise continuous
        functions, taking discontinuities on purpose into account. This
        concept is known from computational fluid dynamics.
        \textbackslash Methods: Test calculations were carried out for
        (I) a Milne-Eddington atmosphere; (II) an atmosphere featuring a
        single discontinuity that is shifted across one grid cell; and
        (III) a two-layered atmosphere with discontinuities in the
        source function, the velocity, and the magnetic field.
        \textbackslash Results: It is shown that the method of piecewise
        continuous reconstruction is a viable approach to solving the
        radiative transfer equation for polarized light. In the special
        case where a discontinuity coincides with a computational cell
        interface, the method is capable of producing the exact
        solution. Overall, the assessment of the piecewise continuous
        reconstruction method turns out to be cautiously positive, but
        it does not lead to an order-of-magnitude improvement in
        accuracy over conventional methods for the examples considered
        here. More realistic model atmospheres need to be considered for
        judging practical applicability.}},

        {\ensuremath{\mu}}m) spectropolarimeter SPIRou from 2019
        September 18 to November 14. Our radial velocity (RV) time-
        series exhibits activity-induced fluctuations of 45 m s$^{-1}$
        rms, {\ensuremath{\sim}}3 times smaller than those measured in
        the optical domain, that we filter using Gaussian Process
        Regression. We report a 3.9{\ensuremath{\sigma}} detection of
        the recently discovered 8.46 -d transiting planet AU Mic b, with
        an estimated mass of 17.1 $^{+4.7}_{-4.5}$
        M$_{{\ensuremath{\oplus}}}$ and a bulk density of 1.3
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.4 g cm$^{-3}$, inducing an RV signature of
        semi-amplitude K = 8.5 $^{+2.3}_{-2.2}$ m s$^{-1}$ in the
        spectrum of its host star. A consistent detection is
        independently obtained when we simultaneously image stellar
        surface inhomogeneities and estimate the planet parameters with
        Zeeman-Doppler imaging (ZDI). Using ZDI, we invert the time-
        series of unpolarized and circularly polarized spectra into
        surface brightness and large-scale magnetic maps. We find a
        mainly poloidal and axisymmetric field of 475 G, featuring, in
        particular, a dipole of 450 G tilted at 19{\textdegree} to the
        rotation axis. Moreover, we detect a strong differential
        rotation of d{\ensuremath{\Omega}} = 0.167 {\ensuremath{\pm}}
        0.009 rad d$^{-1}$ shearing the large-scale field, about twice
        stronger than that shearing the brightness distribution,
        suggesting that both observables probe different layers of the
        convective zone. Even though we caution that more RV
        measurements are needed to accurately pin down the planet mass,
        AU Mic b already appears as a prime target for constraining
        planet formation models, studying the interactions with the
        surrounding debris disc, and characterizing its atmosphere with
        upcoming space- and ground-based missions.}},

	Abstract = {{We report the discovery of a medium-strength
        (\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde0.5 kG) magnetic field on the
        young, massive star {\ensuremath{\tau}} Sco (B0.2V), which
        becomes the third-hottest magnetic star known. Circularly
        polarized Zeeman signatures are clearly detected in observations
        collected mostly with the ESPaDOnS spectropolarimeter, recently
        installed on the 3.6-m Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope; temporal
        variability is also clearly established in the polarimetry, and
        can be unambiguously attributed to rotational modulation with a
        period close to 41 d. Archival ultraviolet (UV) spectra confirm
        that this modulation repeats over time-scales of decades, and
        refine the rotation period to 41.033 +/- 0.002 d.
        \textbackslash\textbackslashDespite the slow rotation rate of
        {\ensuremath{\tau}} Sco, we none the less succeed in
        reconstructing the large-scale structure of its magnetic
        topology. We find that the magnetic structure is unusually
        complex for a hot star, with significant power in spherical-
        harmonic modes of degree up to 5. The surface topology is
        dominated by a potential field, although a moderate toroidal
        component is probably present. We fail to detect intrinsic
        temporal variability of the magnetic structure over the 1.5-yr
        period of our spectropolarimetric observations (in agreement
        with the stable temporal variations of the UV spectra), and
        infer that any differential surface rotation must be very small.
        \textbackslash\textbackslashThe topology of the extended
        magnetic field that we derive from the photospheric magnetic
        maps is also more complex than a global dipole, and features in
        particular a significantly warped torus of closed magnetic loops
        encircling the star (tilted at about 90{\textdegree} to the
        rotation axis), with additional, smaller, networks of closed-
        field lines. This topology appears to be consistent with the
        exceptional X-ray properties of {\ensuremath{\tau}} Sco and also
        provides a natural explanation of the variability observed in
        wind-formed UV lines. Although we cannot completely rule out the
        possibility that the field is produced through dynamo processes
        of an exotic kind, we conclude that its magnetic field is most
        probably a fossil remnant from the star formation stage.

Our two previous studies were focused on early and mid M dwarfs. The present paper examines 11 fully convective late M dwarfs (spectral types M5–M8). Tomographic imaging techniques were applied to time-series of circularly polarized profiles of six stars, in order to infer their large-scale magnetic topologies. For three other stars we could not produce such magnetic maps, because of low variability of the Stokes V signatures, but were able to derive some properties of the magnetic fields.We find two distinct categories of magnetic topologies: on the one hand strong axisymmetric dipolar fields (similar to mid M dwarfs), and on the other hand weak fields generally featuring a significant non-axisymmetric component, and sometimes a significant toroidal one. Comparison with unsigned magnetic fluxes demonstrates that the second category of magnetic fields shows less organization (less energy in the large scales), similarly to partly convective early M dwarfs. Stars in both categories have similar stellar parameters, our data do not evidence a separation between these two categories in the mass–rotation plane.We also report marginal detection of a large-scale magnetic field on the M8 star VB 10 featuring a significant toroidal axisymmetric component, whereas no field is detectable on VB 8 (M7).}",

        at investigating observationally how dynamo processes operate in
        stars on both sides of the full convection threshold (spectral
        type M4). \textbackslash\textbackslashThe present paper focuses
        on early M stars (M0-M3), that is above the full convection
        threshold. Applying tomographic imaging techniques to time
        series of rotationally modulated circularly polarized profiles
        collected with the NARVAL spectropolarimeter, we determine the
        rotation period and reconstruct the large-scale magnetic
        topologies of six early M dwarfs. We find that early-M stars
        preferentially host large-scale fields with dominantly toroidal
        and non-axisymmetric poloidal configurations, along with
        significant differential rotation (and long-term variability);
        only the lowest-mass star of our subsample is found to host an
        almost fully poloidal, mainly axisymmetric large-scale field
        resembling those found in mid-M dwarfs.
        \textbackslash\textbackslashThis abrupt change in the large-
        scale magnetic topologies of M dwarfs (occurring at spectral
        type M3) has no related signature on X-ray luminosities
        (measuring the total amount of magnetic flux); it thus suggests
        that underlying dynamo processes become more efficient at
        producing large-scale fields (despite producing the same flux)
        at spectral types later than M3. We suspect that this change
        relates to the rapid decrease in the radiative cores of low-mass
        stars and to the simultaneous sharp increase of the convective
        turnover times (with decreasing stellar mass) that models
        predict to occur at M3; it may also be (at least partly)
        responsible for the reduced magnetic braking reported for fully
        convective stars. \textbackslash\textbackslashBased on

        periods of the M-type dwarf stars being observed by the CARMENES
        exoplanet survey to help distinguish radial-velocity signals
        produced by magnetic activity from those produced by exoplanets.
        Rotation periods are also fundamental for a detailed study of
        the relation between activity and rotation in late-type stars.
        \textbackslash Methods: We look for significant periodic signals
        in 622 photometric time series of 337 bright, nearby M dwarfs
        obtained by long-time baseline, automated surveys (MEarth, ASAS,
        SuperWASP, NSVS, Catalina, ASAS-SN, K2, and HATNet) and for 20
        stars which we obtained with four 0.2-0.8 m telescopes at high
        geographical latitudes. \textbackslash Results: We present 142
        rotation periods (73 new) from 0.12 d to 133 d and ten long-term
        activity cycles (six new) from 3.0 a to 11.5 a. We compare our
        determinations with those in the existing literature; we
        investigate the distribution of P$_{rot}$ in the CARMENES input
        catalogue, the amplitude of photometric variability, and their
        relation to v sini and pEW(H{\ensuremath{\alpha}}); and we

        spectrograph/spectropolarimeter, for general community use at
        the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. This instrument will
        provide: (1) a complete optical spectrum from 370 to 1,000 nm in
        a single exposure, with a variable resolution between 50,000 and
        75,000, (2) all polarization components of the stellar light,
        and (3) 20\% peak total throughput. The wide spectral coverage
        will maximize the multiplex gain associated wtih multi-line
        techniques. The high resolution will give sufficient spatial
        resolution for Doppler and Zeeman-Doppler imaging of rapid
        rotators, increasing the sensitivity of the observations to
        small-scale structures. It will also allow accurate brightness,
        abundance and magnetic field mapping of moderate rotators, and
        help study stellar pulsations, abundances, and extrasolar
        planets. The possibility of recording two interleaved spectra
        will be very useful in polarimetric mode, and very convenient
        for faint object spectroscopy in non-polarimetric mode, where
        the spectrum of the adjacent sky will be recorded along with
        that of the target. The spectrographic is bench-mounted and fed
        by low-OH H-treated Ceram-Optec optical fibers from a Cassegran
        module containing all calibration and polarimetric facilities,
        making it possible to have extremely good wavelength stability
        and minimal instrumental polarization. The achromatic
        polarimeter includes one quarter-wave and two half-wave Fresnel
        rhombs coupled to a removable Wollaston prism. ESPaDOnS will be
        a unqiue instrument worldwide in polarimetric mode, competitive
        wiht similar instruments on 8-m class telescopes in non-
        polarimetric mode. Astronomers will be able to address with

	Abstract = {{Since 1st light in 2002, HARPS has been setting the standard in the exo-
        planet detection by radial velocity (RV) measurements[1]. Based
        on this experience, our consortium is developing a high accuracy
        near-infrared RV spectrograph covering YJH bands to detect and
        characterize low-mass planets in the habitable zone of M dwarfs.
        It will allow RV measurements at the 1-m/s level and will look
        for habitable planets around M- type stars by following up the
        candidates found by the upcoming space missions TESS, CHEOPS and
        later PLATO. NIRPS and HARPS, working simultaneously on the ESO
        3.6m are bound to become a single powerful high-resolution,
        high-fidelity spectrograph covering from 0.4 to 1.8 micron.
        NIRPS will complement HARPS in validating earth-like planets
        found around G and K-type stars whose signal is at the same
        order of magnitude than the stellar noise. Because at equal
        resolving power the overall dimensions of a spectrograph vary
        linearly with the input beam {\'e}tendue, spectrograph designed
        for seeing-limited observations are large and expensive. NIRPS
        will use a high order adaptive optics system to couple the
        starlight into a fiber corresponding to 0.4`` on the sky as
        efficiently or better than HARPS or ESPRESSO couple the light
        0.9'' fiber. This allows the spectrograph to be very compact,
        more thermally stable and less costly. Using a custom
        tan({\ensuremath{\theta}})=4 dispersion grating in combination
        with a start-of-the-art Hawaii4RG detector makes NIRPS very
        efficient with complete coverage of the YJH bands at 110'000
        resolution. NIRPS works in a regime that is in-between the usual
        multi-mode (MM) where 1000's of modes propagates in the fiber
        and the single mode well suited for perfect optical systems.
        This regime called few-modes regime is prone to modal noise-
        Results from a significant R and D effort made to characterize
        and circumvent the modal noise show that this contribution to
        the performance budget shall not preclude the RV performance to
        be achieved.}},

	Abstract = {{Since 2012, thanks to the installation of the high-resolution echelle
        spectrograph in the optical range HARPS-N, the Italian telescope
        TNG (La Palma) became one of the key facilities for the study of
        the extrasolar planets. In 2014 TNG also offered GIANO to the
        scientific community, providing a near-infrared (NIR) cross-
        dispersed echelle spectroscopy covering
        0.97-2.45{\ensuremath{\mu}}m at a resolution of 50000. GIANO,
        although designed for direct light-feed from the telescope at
        the Nasmyth-B focus, was provisionally mounted on the rotating
        building and connected via fibers to only available interface at
        the Nasmyth-A focal plane. The synergy between these two
        instruments is particularly appealing for a wide range of
        science cases, especially for the search of exoplanets around
        young and active stars and the characterisation of their
        atmosphere. Through the funding scheme ``WOW'' (a Way to Others
        Worlds), the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF)
        proposed to position GIANO at the focal station for which it was
        originally designed and the simultaneous use of these
        spectrographs with the aim to achieve high-resolution
        spectroscopy in a wide wavelength range
        (0.383-2.45{\ensuremath{\mu}}m) obtained in a single exposure,
        giving rise to the project called GIARPS (GIANO-B \& HARPS-N).
        Because of its characteristics, GIARPS can be considered the
        first and unique worldwide instrument providing not only high
        resolution in a large wavelength band, but also a high-precision
        radial velocity measurement both in the visible and in the NIR

	Abstract = {{The absorption-line spectra of early B-type supergiants show significant
        broadening that implies that an additional broadening mechanism
        (characterized here as `macroturbulence') is present in addition
        to rotational broadening. Using high-resolution spectra with
        signal-to-noise ratios of typically 500, we have attempted to
        quantify the relative contributions of rotation and
        macroturbulence, but even with data of this quality significant
        problems were encountered. However, for all our targets, a model
        where macroturbulence dominates and rotation is negligible is
        acceptable; the reverse scenario leads to poor agreement between
        theory and observation. Additionally, there is marginal evidence
        for the degree of broadening increasing with line strength,
        possibly a result of the stronger lines being formed higher in
        the atmosphere. Acceptable values of the projected rotational
        velocity are normally less than or equal to 50 km s$^{-1}$,
        which may also be a typical upper limit for the rotational
        velocity. Our best estimates for the projected rotational
        velocity are typically 10-20 km s$^{-1}$ and hence compatible
        with this limit. These values are compared with those predicted
        by single star evolutionary models, which are initially rapidly
        rotating. It is concluded that either these models underestimate
        the rate of rotational breaking or some of the targets may be
        evolving through a blue loop or are binaries.}},

        models incorporating these processes are in substantially better
        agreement with the inferred solar sound speed than are models
        that neglect them. The remaining discrepancy between the models
        and the Sun has been taken as evidence for mixing in the region

        This perhaps demonstrates the danger of complacency when dealing
        with so complex a thing as a star. Hydrodynamical instabilities
        are likely to play a more important role than acknowledged in
        standard stellar modelling. An interesting example, if not
        relevant to modelling up to the present solar age, is the

	Abstract = {{In previous work, we have shown that recent updated standard solar
        models cannot reproduce the radial profile of the sound speed at
        the base of the convective zone and fail to predict the
        photospheric lithium abundance. In parallel, helioseismology has
        shown that the transition from differential rotation in the
        convective zone to almost uniform rotation in the radiative
        solar interior occurs in a shallow layer called the tachocline.
        This layer is presumably the seat of a large-scale circulation
        and of turbulent motions. Here we introduce a macroscopic
        transport term in the structure equations that is based on a
        hydrodynamical description of the tachocline proposed by Spiegel
        \& Zahn, and we calculate the mixing induced within this layer.
        We discuss the influence of different parameters that represent
        the tachocline thickness, the Brunt-V{\"a}is{\"a}l{\"a}
        frequency at the base of the convective zone, and the time
        dependence of this mixing process along the Sun's evolution. We
        show that the introduction of such a process inhibits the
        microscopic diffusion by about 25\%. Starting from models
        including a pre-main-sequence evolution, we obtain (1) a good
        agreement with observed photospheric chemical abundance of light
        elements such as $^{3}$He, $^{4}$He, $^{7}$Li, and $^{9}$Be; (2)
        a smooth composition gradient at the base of the convective
        zone; and (3) a significant improvement of the sound-speed
        square difference between the seismic Sun and the models in this
        transition region when we allow the photospheric heavy-element
        abundance to adjust, within the observational incertitude, as a
        result of the action of this mixing process. The impact on

	Abstract = {{If the origin of life and the evolution of observers on a planet is
        favored by atypical properties of a planet's host star, we would
        expect our Sun to be atypical with respect to such properties.
        The Sun has been described by previous studies as both typical
        and atypical. In an effort to reduce this ambiguity and quantify
        how typical the Sun is, we identify 11 maximally independent
        properties that have plausible correlations with habitability
        and that have been observed by, or can be derived from,
        sufficiently large, currently available, and representative
        stellar surveys. By comparing solar values for the 11 properties
        to the resultant stellar distributions, we make the most
        comprehensive comparison of the Sun to other stars. The two most
        atypical properties of the Sun are its mass and orbit. The Sun
        is more massive than 95\% +/- 2\% of nearby stars, and its orbit
        around the Galaxy is less eccentric than 93\% +/- 1\% of FGK
        stars within 40 pc. Despite these apparently atypical
        properties, a {\ensuremath{\chi}}$^{2}$ analysis of the Sun's
        values for 11 properties, taken together, yields a solar
        {\ensuremath{\chi}}$^{2}$$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ = 8.39 +/-
        0.96. If a star is chosen at random, the probability that it
        will have a lower value (i.e., be more typical) than the Sun,
        with respect to the 11 properties analyzed here, is only 29\%
        +/- 11\% . These values quantify, and are consistent with, the
        idea that the Sun is a typical star. If we have sampled all
        reasonable properties associated with habitability, our result
        suggests that there are no special requirements for a star to
        host a planet with life.}},

	Abstract = {{Context. Earth's atmosphere imprints a large number of telluric
        absorption and emission lines on astronomical spectra,
        especially in the near infrared, that need to be removed before
        analysing the affected wavelength regions. \textbackslash Aims:
        These lines are typically removed by comparison to A- or B-type
        stars used as telluric standards that themselves have strong
        hydrogen lines, which complicates the removal of telluric lines.
        We have developed a method to circumvent that problem.
        \textbackslash Methods: For our IDL software package tellrem we
        used a recent approach to model telluric absorption features
        with the line-by-line radiative transfer model (LBLRTM). The
        broad wavelength coverage of the X-Shooter at VLT allows us to
        expand their technique by determining the abundances of the most
        important telluric molecules H$_{2}$O, O$_{2}$, CO$_{2}$, and
        CH$_{4}$ from sufficiently isolated line groups. For individual
        observations we construct a telluric absorption model for most
        of the spectral range that is used to remove the telluric
        absorption from the object spectrum. \textbackslash Results: We
        remove telluric absorption from both continuum regions and
        emission lines without systematic residuals for most of the
        processable spectral range; however, our method increases the
        statistical errors. The errors of the corrected spectrum
        typically increase by 10\% for S/N
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 10 and by a factor of two for
        high-quality data (S/N \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 100),
        I.e. the method is accurate on the percent level. \textbackslash
        Conclusions: Modelling telluric absorption can be an alternative
        to the observation of standard stars for removing telluric
        contamination. \textbackslash\textbackslashBased on observations

        effects of the Earth's atmosphere. Oxygen, water vapour and a

        discrete frequencies, shaping observing bands in the near- and
        mid-infrared and leaving their fingerprints - telluric
        absorption and emission lines - in astronomical spectra. The
        standard approach of removing the absorption lines is to observe
        a telluric standard star: a time-consuming and often imperfect
        solution. Alternatively, the spectral features of the Earth's
        atmosphere can be modelled using a radiative transfer code,
        often delivering a satisfying solution that removes these
        features without additional observations. In addition the model
        also provides a precise wavelength solution and an instrumental

	Abstract = {{A spectroscopic data base has been used together with an appropriate
        forward model to build synthetic transmission spectra of the
        Earth atmosphere around 589.5 nm. The aim is the modeling of the
        telluric H2O absorption lines imprinted in the astronomical
        spectra recorded at different altitudes. After convolution of
        these theoretical spectra by the relevant spectrometer
        instrumental function, and adjustment of the H$_{2}$O content,
        the division of the recorded spectrum by the calculated
        transmission removes the telluric lines, making clearer the
        other features. Results of such a procedure are shown in the
        case of high resolution spectra (R = 110000), in a 1.5 nm
        interval region around the sodium doublet for two different
        sites. An extreme case is shown, where the detection of a small
        interstellar line (0.5 - 10$^{-14}$ nm equivalent width) has
        been possible with the Aur{\'e}lie spectrometer of the
        Observatoire de Haute-Provence (France), in spite of its
        location on the flanks of H2O lines which are 20 times stronger.
        The adequacy of the method, which in principle can be extended
        to any wavelength range and relevant molecules, is discussed
        depending on the type of the observations. These spectra can
        also be simply used for visual comparisons pr to calculate in
        advance the optimum date of observation of a particular feature.}},

	Abstract = {{The precision of radial velocity (RV) measurements depends on the
        precision attained on the wavelength calibration. One of the
        available options is to use atmospheric lines as a natural,
        freely available wavelength reference. Figueira et al. measured
        the RV of O$_{2}$ lines using High Accuracy Radial velocity
        Planet Searcher (HARPS) and showed that the scatter was only of
        {\ensuremath{\sim}}10 m s$^{-1}$ over a time-scale of 6 yr.
        Using a simple but physically motivated empirical model, they
        demonstrated a precision of 2 m s$^{-1}$, roughly twice the
        average photon noise contribution. In this paper, we take
        advantage of a unique opportunity to confirm the sensitivity of
        the telluric absorption lines' RV to different atmospheric and
        observing conditions by means of contemporaneous in situ wind
        measurements. This opportunity is a result of the work done
        during site testing and characterization for the European
        Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT). The HARPS spectrograph was
        used to monitor telluric standards while contemporaneous
        atmospheric data were collected using radiosondes. We
        quantitatively compare the information recovered by the two
        independent approaches. \textbackslash\textbackslashThe RV model
        fitting yielded results similar to that of Figueira et al., with
        lower wind magnitude values and varied wind direction. The
        probes confirmed the average low wind magnitude and suggested
        that the average wind direction is a function of time as well.
        However, these results are affected by large uncertainty bars
        that probably result from a complex wind structure as a function
        of height. The two approaches deliver the same results in what
        concerns wind magnitude and agree on wind direction when fitting
        is done in segments of a couple of hours. Statistical tests show
        that the model provides a good description of the data on all
        time-scales, being always preferable to not fitting any
        atmospheric variation. The smaller the time-scale on which the
        fitting can be performed (down to a couple of hours), the better
        the description of the real physical parameters is. We then
        conclude that the two methods deliver compatible results, down
        to better than 5 m s$^{-1}$ and less than twice the estimated
        photon noise contribution on O$_{2}$ lines' RV measurement.
        However, we cannot rule out that parameters
        {\ensuremath{\alpha}} and {\ensuremath{\gamma}} (dependence on
        airmass and zero-point, respectively) have a dependence on time
        or exhibit some cross-talk with other parameters, an issue
        suggested by some of the results.}},

	Abstract = {{Classification of stars, by comparing their optical spectra to a few
        dozen spectral standards, has been a workhorse of observational
        astronomy for more than a century. Here, we extend this
        technique by compiling a library of optical spectra of 404
        touchstone stars observed with Keck/HIRES by the California
        Planet Search. The spectra have high resolution (R
        {\ensuremath{\approx}} 60,000), high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N
        {\ensuremath{\approx}} 150/pixel), and are registered onto a
        common wavelength scale. The library stars have properties
        derived from interferometry, asteroseismology, LTE spectral
        synthesis, and spectrophotometry. To address a lack of well-
        characterized late-K dwarfs in the literature, we measure
        stellar radii and temperatures for 23 nearby K dwarfs, using
        modeling of the spectral energy distribution and Gaia
        parallaxes. This library represents a uniform data set spanning
        the spectral types {\ensuremath{\sim}}M5-F1 (T $_{eff}$

        accuracies of 100 K in effective temperature (T $_{eff}$), 15\%
        in stellar radius (R $_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$), and 0.09 dex in
        metallicity ([Fe/H]). Because the code relies on empirical
        spectra it performs particularly well for stars
        {\ensuremath{\sim}}K4 and later, which are challenging to model
        with existing spectral synthesizers, reaching accuracies of 70 K
        in T $_{eff}$, 10\% in R $_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$, and 0.12 dex
        in [Fe/H]. We also validate the performance of SpecMatch-Emp,
        finding it to be robust at lower spectral resolution and S/N,
        enabling the characterization of faint late-type stars. Both the
        library and stellar characterization code are publicly

        p < 0.01 {\ensuremath{\rho}}{\ensuremath{\geq}}g cm$^{-3}$.
        \textbackslash\textbackslashWe present radiative Rosseland mean
        opacities for envelopes obtained using atomic data calculated in
        an international collaboration referred to as the Opacity
        Project, or OP. Equations of state are calculated using an
        occupation-probability formalism. To a good approximation,
        ionization equilibria and level populations in envelopes depend
        only on the temperature T and electron density N$_{e}$ and are
        insensitive to chemical mixtures. Monochromatic opacities for
        all abundant chemical elements are therefore calculated on a
        grid of (T, N$_{e}$) values and are archived. Rosseland mean
        opacities are then readily calculated for any chemical mixture.
        Tables of Rosseland means, for any required mixtures and as
        functions of {\ensuremath{\rho}} and T, are available on request
        in computer-readable form. \textbackslash\textbackslashThe
        present, op, results are compared with those from another recent
        study, referred to as OPAL, by C. A. Iglesias and F. A. Rogers
        at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The agreement
        between the OP and OPAL calculations is generally good, although
        there are some differences. Both calculations give results
        larger than those obtained in earlier work, by factors of up to
        3 or more.}},

	Abstract = {{\textbackslash Aims: We present the Stagger-grid, a comprehensive grid
        of time-dependent, three-dimensional (3D), hydrodynamic model
        atmospheres for late-type stars with realistic treatment of
        radiative transfer, covering a wide range in stellar parameters.
        This grid of 3D models is intended for various applications
        besides studies of stellar convection and atmospheres per se,
        including stellar parameter determination, stellar spectroscopy
        and abundance analysis, asteroseismology, calibration of stellar
        evolution models, interferometry, and extrasolar planet search.
        In this introductory paper, we describe the methods we applied
        for the computation of the grid and discuss the general
        properties of the 3D models as well as of their temporal and
        spatial averages (here denoted ⟨3D⟩ models). \textbackslash
        Methods: All our models were generated with the Stagger-code,
        using realistic input physics for the equation of state (EOS)
        and for continuous and line opacities. Our
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 220 grid models range in
        effective temperature, T$_{eff}$, from 4000 to 7000 K in steps
        of 500 K, in surface gravity, log g, from 1.5 to 5.0 in steps of
        0.5 dex, and metallicity, [Fe/H], from - 4.0 to + 0.5 in steps
        of 0.5 and 1.0 dex. \textbackslash Results: We find a tight
        scaling relation between the vertical velocity and the surface
        entropy jump, which itself correlates with the constant entropy
        value of the adiabatic convection zone. The range in intensity
        contrast is enhanced at lower metallicity. The granule size
        correlates closely with the pressure scale height sampled at the
        depth of maximum velocity. We compare the ⟨3D⟩ models with
        currently widely applied one-dimensional (1D) atmosphere models,
        as well as with theoretical 1D hydrostatic models generated with
        the same EOS and opacity tables as the 3D models, in order to
        isolate the effects of using self-consistent and hydrodynamic
        modeling of convection, rather than the classical mixing length
        theory approach. For the first time, we are able to quantify
        systematically over a broad range of stellar parameters the
        uncertainties of 1D models arising from the simplified treatment
        of physics, in particular convective energy transport. In
        agreement with previous findings, we find that the differences
        can be rather significant, especially for metal-poor stars.

@article{narain_1996,
	Abstract = {{We review the mechanisms which are thought to provide steady heating of
        chromospheres and coronae. It appears now fairly well
        established that nonmagnetic chromospheric regions of latetype
        stars are heated by shock dissipation of acoustic waves which
        are generated in the stellar surface convection zones. In the
        case of late-type giants there is additional heating by shocks
        from pulsational waves. For slowly rotating stars, which have
        weak or no magnetic fields, these two are the dominant
        chromospheric heating mechanisms. Except for F-stars, the
        chromospheric heating of rapidly rotating late-type stars is
        dominated by magnetic heating either through MHD wave
        dissipation (AC mechanisms) or through magnetic field
        dissipation (DC mechanisms). The MHD wave and magnetic field
        energy comes from fluid motions in the stellar convection zones.
        Waves are also generated by reconnective events at chromospheric
        and coronal heights. The high-frequency part of the motion
        spectrum leads to AC heating, the low frequency part to DC
        heating. The coronae are almost exclusively heated by magnetic
        mechanisms. It is not possible to say at the moment whether AC
        or DC mechanisms are dominant, although presently the DC
        mechanisms (e.g., nanoflares) appear to be the more important.
        Only a more detailed study of the formation of and the
        dissipation in small-scale structures can answer this question.
        The X-ray emission in early-type stars shows the presence of
        coronal structures which are very different from those in late-
        type stars. This emission apparently arises in the hot post-
        shock regions of gas blobs which are accelerated in the stellar
        wind by the intense radiation field of these stars.}},

	Abstract = {{Magnetic fields play a fundamental role for interior and atmospheric
        properties of M dwarfs and greatly influence terrestrial planets
        orbiting in the habitable zones of these low-mass stars.
        Determination of the strength and topology of magnetic fields,
        both on stellar surfaces and throughout the extended stellar
        magnetospheres, is a key ingredient for advancing stellar and
        planetary science. Here, modern methods of magnetic field
        measurements applied to M-dwarf stars are reviewed, with an
        emphasis on direct diagnostics based on interpretation of the
        Zeeman effect signatures in high-resolution intensity and
        polarisation spectra. Results of the mean field strength
        measurements derived from Zeeman broadening analyses as well as
        information on the global magnetic geometries inferred by
        applying tomographic mapping methods to spectropolarimetric
        observations are summarised and critically evaluated. The
        emerging understanding of the complex, multi-scale nature of
        M-dwarf magnetic fields is discussed in the context of
        theoretical models of hydromagnetic dynamos and stellar interior
        structure altered by magnetic fields.}},

	Abstract = {{Rotation is a directly observable stellar property, and it drives
        magnetic field generation and activity through a magnetic
        dynamo. Main-sequence stars with masses below approximately 0.35
        \{M\}$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}} }$ (mid-to-late M dwarfs) are fully
        convective, and are expected to have a different type of dynamo
        mechanism than solar-type stars. Measurements of their rotation
        rates provide insight into these mechanisms, but few rotation
        periods are available for these stars at field ages. Using
        photometry from the MEarth Project, we measure rotation periods
        for 387 nearby, mid-to-late M dwarfs in the northern hemisphere,
        finding periods from 0.1 to 140 days. The typical rotator has
        stable, sinusoidal photometric modulations at a semi-amplitude
        of 0.5\%-1\%. We find no period-amplitude relation for stars
        below 0.25 \{M\}$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}} }$ and an
        anticorrelation between period and amplitude for higher-mass M
        dwarfs. We highlight the existence of older, slowly rotating
        stars without H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emission that nevertheless
        have strong photometric variability. We use parallaxes, proper
        motions, radial velocities, photometry, and near-infrared
        metallicity estimates to further characterize the population of
        rotators. The Galactic kinematics of our sample is consistent
        with the local population of G and K dwarfs, and rotators have
        metallicities characteristic of the solar neighborhood. We use
        the W space velocities and established age-velocity relations to
        estimate that stars with P < 10 days have ages of on average <2
        Gyr, and that those with P > 70 days have ages of about 5 Gyr.
        The period distribution is dependent on mass: as the mass
        decreases, the slowest rotators at a given mass have longer
        periods, and the fastest rotators have shorter periods. We find
        a lack of stars with intermediate rotation periods, and the gap
        between the fast and slow rotators is larger for lower masses.
        Our data are consistent with a scenario in which these stars
        maintain rapid rotation for several gigayears, then spin down
        quickly, reaching periods of around 100 days by a typical age of
        5 Gyr.}},

        by magnetic reconnection, shock fronts (such as those formed by
        coronal mass ejections (CMEs)), and magnetospheric currents, in
        some cases offering the only window into these processes in
        stellar atmospheres. We conducted a 58 hr ultra-wideband survey
        for coherent radio bursts on five active M dwarfs. We used the
        Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array to observe simultaneously in
        three frequency bands covering a subset of 224-482 MHz and 1-6
        GHz, achieving the widest fractional bandwidth to date for any
        observations of stellar radio bursts. We detected 22 bursts
        across 13 epochs, providing the first large sample of wideband
        dynamic spectra of stellar coherent radio bursts. The observed
        bursts have diverse morphology, with durations ranging from
        seconds to hours, but all share strong (40\%-100\%) circular
        polarization. No events resemble solar Type II bursts (often

        radio-quiet stellar CMEs. The hours-long bursts are all
        polarized in the sense of the x-mode of the

        that they are cyclotron maser emission from electrons

        processes on ultracool dwarfs. The duty cycle of luminous
        coherent bursts peaks at 25\% at 1-1.4 GHz, declining at lower

        are believed to operate an interface dynamo, it is poorly
        unconstrained in fully convective stars that lack the necessary
        shear layer between radiative core and the convective envelope.
        We present new X-ray observations of 19 slowly rotating fully

        We use these to calculate X-ray luminosities (or upper limits

        magnetically active (H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} in emission) stars.
        The active stars are of mid-M spectral type, have numerous
        flares, and have well-defined rotational modulation due to
        starspots. The inactive stars are of early M type, exhibit less
        starspot signature, and have fewer flares. A Kepler to U-band
        energy scaling allows comparison of the Kepler flare frequency
        distributions with previous ground-based data. M dwarfs span a
        large range of flare frequency and energy, blurring the
        distinction between active and inactive stars designated solely
        by the presence of H{\ensuremath{\alpha}}. We analyzed classical
        and complex (multiple peak) flares on GJ 1243, finding strong
        correlations between flare energy, amplitude, duration, and
        decay time, with only a weak dependence on rise time. Complex
        flares last longer and have higher energy at the same amplitude,
        and higher energy flares are more likely to be complex. A power
        law fits the energy distribution for flares with log E$_{K\_p}$
        31 erg, but the predicted number of low-energy flares far
        exceeds the number observed, at energies where flares are still
        easily detectable, indicating that the power-law distribution
        may flatten at low energy. There is no correlation of flare
        occurrence or energy with starspot phase, the flare waiting time
        distribution is consistent with flares occurring randomly in
        time, and the energies of consecutive flares are uncorrelated.

	Abstract = {{The most abundant stars in the Galaxy, M dwarfs, are very commonly hosts
        to diverse systems of low-mass planets. Their abundancy implies
        that the general occurrence rate of planets is dominated by
        their occurrence rate around such M dwarfs. In this article, we
        combine the M dwarf surveys conducted with the HIRES/Keck,
        PFS/Magellan, HARPS/ESO, and UVES/VLT instruments supported with
        data from several other instruments. We analyse the radial
        velocities of an approximately volume- and brightness-limited
        sample of 426 nearby M dwarfs in order to search for Doppler
        signals of cadidate planets. In addition, we analyse
        spectroscopic activity indicators and ASAS photometry to rule
        out radial velocity signals corresponding to stellar activity as
        Doppler signals of planets. We calculate estimates for the
        occurrence rate of planets around the sample stars and study the
        properties of this occurrence rate as a function of stellar
        properties. Our analyses reveal a total of 118 candidate planets
        orbiting nearby M dwarfs. Based on our results accounting for
        selection effects and sample detection threshold, we estimate
        that M dwarfs have on average at least 2.39$^{+4.58}_{-1.36}$
        planets per star orbiting them. Accounting for the different
        sensitivities of radial velocity surveys and Kepler transit
        photometry implies that there are at least 3.0 planets per star
        orbiting M dwarfs. We also present evidence for a population of
        cool mini-Neptunes and Neptunes with indications that they are
        found an order of magnitude more frequently orbiting the least
        massive M dwarfs in our sample.}},

	Abstract = {{When exoplanets are observed to transit their parent stars, we are
        granted direct estimates of their masses and radii, and we can
        undertake studies of their atmospheres. As a result, such
        systems have profoundly impacted our understanding of the
        physics of exoplanets, yet to date only large exoplanets (akin
        to Jupiter or Neptune) are known to transit their parent stars.
        By targeting nearby M-dwarf stars, a transit search using modest
        equipment is capable of discovering planets as small as 2 Earth
        radii in the habitable zones of their host stars. The discovery
        of such planets is important for two reasons: First, they
        provide fundamental constraints on the physical structure of
        planets that are primarily rock and ice in composition. Second,
        by differencing spectra gathered when the planet is in view from
        those when it is occulted by the star, we can study the
        atmospheric chemistry of potentially habitable worlds. The
        MEarth Project will consist of 8 identical, automated 16-inch
        telescopes in a single enclosure at Mt Hopkins, AZ. Five of
        these telescopes are currently in operation. We will describe
        the target sample, survey design, and the current photometric
        precision, with the goal of demonstrating the feasibility of the
        ground-based detection of habitable exoplanets. We acknowledge

@article{chabrier_2003,
	Abstract = {{We review recent determinations of the present-day mass function (PDMF)
        and initial mass function (IMF) in various components of the
        Galaxy-disk, spheroid, young, and globular clusters-and in
        conditions characteristic of early star formation. As a general
        feature, the IMF is found to depend weakly on the environment
        and to be well described by a power-law form for
        m>\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde1 M$_{solar}$ and a lognormal
        form below, except possibly for early star formation conditions.
        The disk IMF for single objects has a characteristic mass around
        m$_{c}$\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde0.08 M$_{solar}$ and a
        variance in logarithmic mass
        {\ensuremath{\sigma}}\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde0.7,
        whereas the IMF for multiple systems has
        m$_{c}$\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde0.2 M$_{solar}$ and
        {\ensuremath{\sigma}}\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde0.6. The
        extension of the single MF into the brown dwarf regime is in
        good agreement with present estimates of L- and T-dwarf
        densities and yields a disk brown dwarf number density
        comparable to the stellar one, n$_{BD}$\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasc
        iitilden$_{*}$\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde0.1 pc$^{-3}$. The
        IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk
        field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved
        binaries, confirming the fact that young star clusters and disk
        field stars represent the same stellar population. Dynamical
        effects, yielding depletion of the lowest mass objects, are
        found to become consequential for ages
        >\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde130 Myr. The spheroid IMF
        relies on much less robust grounds. The large metallicity spread
        in the local subdwarf photometric sample, in particular, remains
        puzzling. Recent observations suggest that there is a continuous
        kinematic shear between the thick-disk population, present in
        local samples, and the genuine spheroid one. This enables us to
        derive only an upper limit for the spheroid mass density and
        IMF. Within all the uncertainties, the latter is found to be
        similar to the one derived for globular clusters and is well
        represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass
        slightly larger than for the disk,
        m$_{c}$\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde0.2-0.3 M$_{solar}$,
        excluding a significant population of brown dwarfs in globular
        clusters and in the spheroid. The IMF characteristic of early
        star formation at large redshift remains undetermined, but
        different observational constraints suggest that it does not
        extend below \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde1 M$_{solar}$.
        These results suggest a characteristic mass for star formation
        that decreases with time, from conditions prevailing at large
        redshift to conditions characteristic of the spheroid (or thick
        disk) to present-day conditions. These conclusions, however,
        remain speculative, given the large uncertainties in the
        spheroid and early star IMF determinations.
        \textbackslash\textbackslashThese IMFs allow a reasonably robust
        determination of the Galactic present-day and initial stellar
        and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic
        implications beyond the Milky Way in yielding more accurate
        mass-to-light ratio determinations. The mass-to-light ratios
        obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8-1.4
        times smaller than for a Salpeter IMF, respectively, in
        agreement with various recent dynamical determinations. This
        general IMF determination is examined in the context of star
        formation theory. None of the theories based on a Jeans-type
        mechanism, where fragmentation is due only to gravity, can
        fulfill all the observational constraints on star formation and
        predict a large number of substellar objects. On the other hand,
        recent numerical simulations of compressible turbulence, in
        particular in super-Alfv{\'e}nic conditions, seem to reproduce
        both qualitatively and quantitatively the stellar and substellar
        IMF and thus provide an appealing theoretical foundation. In
        this picture, star formation is induced by the dissipation of
        large-scale turbulence to smaller scales through radiative MHD
        shocks, producing filamentary structures. These shocks produce
        local nonequilibrium structures with large density contrasts,
        which collapse eventually in gravitationally bound objects under
        the combined influence of turbulence and gravity. The concept of
        a single Jeans mass is replaced by a distribution of local Jeans
        masses, representative of the lognormal probability density
        function of the turbulent gas. Objects below the mean thermal
        Jeans mass still have a possibility to collapse, although with a
        decreasing probability. \textbackslash\textbackslashThe page

@article{passegger_2022,
	Abstract = {{Deriving metallicities for solar-like stars follows well-established
        methods, but for cooler stars such as M dwarfs, the
        determination is much more complicated due to forests of
        molecular lines that are present. Several methods have been
        developed in recent years to determine accurate stellar
        parameters for these cool stars (T$_{eff}$
        {\ensuremath{\lesssim}} 4000 K). However, significant
        differences can be found at times when comparing metallicities
        for the same star derived using different methods. In this work,
        we determine the effective temperatures, surface gravities, and
        metallicities of 18 well-studied M dwarfs observed with the
        CARMENES high-resolution spectrograph following different
        approaches, including synthetic spectral fitting, analysis of
        pseudo-equivalent widths, and machine learning. We analyzed the
        discrepancies in the derived stellar parameters, including
        metallicity, in several analysis runs. Our goal is to minimize
        these discrepancies and find stellar parameters that are more
        consistent with the literature values. We attempted to achieve
        this consistency by standardizing the most commonly used
        components, such as wavelength ranges, synthetic model spectra,
        continuum normalization methods, and stellar parameters. We
        conclude that although such modifications work quite well for
        hotter main-sequence stars, they do not improve the consistency
        in stellar parameters for M dwarfs, leading to mean deviations
        of around 50-200 K in temperature and 0.1-0.3 dex in
        metallicity. In particular, M dwarfs are much more complex and a
        standardization of the aforementioned components cannot be
        considered as a straightforward recipe for bringing consistency
        to the derived parameters. Further in-depth investigations of
        the employed methods would be necessary in order to identify and
        correct for the discrepancies that remain.

	Abstract = {{\textbackslash Aims: We provide an open-source code allowing an easy,
        intuitive, and robust normalisation of spectra. \textbackslash
        Methods: We developed RASSINE, a Python code for normalising
        merged 1D spectra through the concepts of convex hulls. The code
        uses six parameters that can be easily fine-tuned. The code also
        provides a complete user-friendly interactive interface,
        including graphical feedback, that helps the user to choose the
        parameters as easily as possible. To facilitate the
        normalisation even further, RASSINE can provide a first guess
        for the parameters that are derived directly from the merged 1D
        spectrum based on previously performed calibrations.
        \textbackslash Results: For HARPS spectra of the Sun that were
        obtained with the HELIOS solar telescope, a continuum accuracy
        of 0.20\% on line depth can be reached after normalisation with
        RASSINE. This is three times better than with the commonly used
        method of polynomial fitting. For HARPS spectra of
        {\ensuremath{\alpha}} Cen B, a continuum accuracy of 2.0\% is
        reached. This rather poor accuracy is mainly due to molecular
        band absorption and the high density of spectral lines in the
        bluest part of the merged 1D spectrum. When wavelengths shorter
        than 4500 {\r{A}} are excluded, the continuum accuracy improves
        by up to 1.2\%. The line-depth precision on individual spectrum
        normalisation is estimated to be {\ensuremath{\sim}}0.15\%,
        which can be reduced to the photon-noise limit (0.10\%) when a
        time series of spectra is given as input for RASSINE.
        \textbackslash Conclusions: With a continuum accuracy higher
        than the polynomial fitting method and a line-depth precision
        compatible with photon noise, RASSINE is a tool that can find
        applications in numerous cases, for example stellar parameter
        determination, transmission spectroscopy of exoplanet
        atmospheres, or activity-sensitive line detection.}},

	Abstract = {{The ``Vienna Atomic Line Data Base'' (VALD) consists of a set of
        critically evaluated lists of astrophysically important atomic
        transition parameters and supporting extraction software. VALD
        contains about 600000 entries and is one of the largest
        collections of accurate and homogeneous data for atomic
        transitions presently available. It also includes specific tools
        for extracting data for spectrum synthesis and model atmosphere
        calculations. The different accuracies of data available in the
        literature made it necessary to introduce a ranking system and
        to provide a flexible method for extracting the best possible
        set of atomic line parameters for a given transition from all
        the available sources. The data base is presently restricted to
        spectral lines which are relevant for stars in which the LTE
        approximation is sufficient and molecular lines do not have to
        be taken into account. The provision was made that these
        requirements should not restrict the general design of VALD and
        the possibility of future expansion. In this paper we describe
        the structure of VALD, the available data sets and specific
        retrieval tools. The electronic-mail interface (VALD-EMS)

        from optical interferometry and with those for 14 stars in
        eclipsing binary systems. We compare all directly measured M
        dwarf radii to model predictions and find that current models
        underestimate the true stellar radii by up to 15\%-20\%. The
        differences are small among the metal-poor stars but become
        significantly larger with increasing metallicity. This suggests
        that theoretical models for low-mass stars may be missing some
        opacity source that alters the computed stellar radii.}},

	Abstract = {{Determining the effective temperatures (T$_{eff}$) of red supergiants
        (RSGs) observationally is important in many fields of stellar
        physics and galactic astronomy, yet some significant
        difficulties remain as a result of the model uncertainty, which
        originates mainly in the extended atmospheres of RSGs. Here we
        propose a line-depth ratio (LDR) method in which we use only Fe
        I lines. As opposed to the conventional LDR method, in which
        lines of multiple species are involved, this LDR method is
        insensitive to surface gravity effects and is expected to
        circumvent the uncertainty originating in the upper atmosphere
        of RSGs. Therefore, the LDR-T$_{eff}$ relationships that we
        calibrated empirically with red giants can be directly applied
        to RSGs, although various differences between the two groups of
        objects, for example caused by 3D non-local thermodynamic
        equilibrium (non-LTE) effects, need to be kept in mind. Using
        the near-infrared YJ-band spectra of nine well-known solar-
        metallicity red giants observed with the WINERED high-resolution
        spectrograph, we selected 12 pairs of Fe I lines that were the
        least contaminated with other lines. After applying their
        LDR-T$_{eff}$ relation to 10 nearby RSGs, the resulting
        T$_{eff}$ with an internal precision of $30\!-\!70\, \mathrm{K}$
        shows good agreement with previous observational results
        assuming 1D LTE and with the Geneva stellar evolution model. We
        found no evidence of significant systematic bias caused by
        various differences, including those in the size of the non-LTE
        effects, between red giants and RSGs, except for one line pair
        that we rejected because the non-LTE effects may be as large as
        $\sim \! 250\, \mathrm{K}$ . Nevertheless, it is difficult to
        evaluate the systematic bias, and further study is required, for
        example including the 3D non-LTE calculations of all the lines
        involved.}},

	Abstract = {{High-resolution, near-infrared spectra will be the primary tool for
        finding and characterizing Earth-like planets around low-mass
        stars. Yet, the properties of exoplanets cannot be precisely
        determined without accurate and precise measurements of the host
        star. Spectra obtained with the Immersion Grating Infrared
        Spectrometer simultaneously provide diagnostics for most stellar
        parameters, but the first step in any analysis is the
        determination of the effective temperature. Here we report the
        calibration of high-resolution H-band spectra to accurately
        determine the effective temperature for stars between 4000 and
        3000 K ({\ensuremath{\sim}}K8-M5) using absorption line-depths
        of Fe I, OH, and Al I. The field star sample used here contains
        254 K and M stars with temperatures derived using BT-Settl
        synthetic spectra. We use 106 stars with precise temperatures in
        the literature to calibrate our method, with typical errors of
        about 140 K, and systematic uncertainties less than
        {\ensuremath{\sim}}120 K. For the broadest applicability, we
        present T $_{eff}$-line-depth-ratio relationships, which we test
        on 12 members of the TW Hydrae Association and at spectral
        resolving powers between {\ensuremath{\sim}}10,000 and 120,000.
        These ratios offer a simple but accurate measure of effective

        which to determine precise stellar parameters. Some of these
        methods are highly dependent on correct spectroscopic
        calibrations. \textbackslash Aims: The goal of this work is to
        obtain a new spectroscopic calibration for a fast estimate of
        T$_{eff}$ and [Fe/H] for a wide range of stellar spectral types.
        \textbackslash Methods: We used spectra from a joint sample of
        708 stars, compiled from 451 FGK dwarfs and 257 GK-giant stars.
        We used homogeneously determined spectroscopic stellar
        parameters to derive temperature calibrations using a set of
        selected EW line-ratios, and [Fe/H] calibrations using a set of
        selected Fe I lines. \textbackslash Results: We have derived 322
        EW line-ratios and 100 Fe I lines that can be used to compute
        T$_{eff}$ and [Fe/H], respectively. We show that these
        calibrations are effective for FGK dwarfs and GK-giant stars in
        the following ranges: 4500 K <T$_{eff}$< 6500 K, 2.5 < log g<
        4.9 dex, and -0.8 < [Fe/H] < 0.5 dex. The new calibration has a
        standard deviation of 74 K for T$_{eff}$ and 0.07 dex for
        [Fe/H]. We use four independent samples of stars to test and
        verify the new calibration, a sample of 56 giant stars, a sample
        composed of Gaia FGK benchmark stars, a sample of 36 GK-giant
        stars of the DR1 of the Gaia-ESO survey, and a sample of 582
        FGK-dwarf stars. We also provide a new computer code, GeTCal,

        Methods: We use a new method that takes advantage of the HARPS
        high-resolution spectra to increase the precision of
        metallicity, using previous photometric calibrations of [Fe/H]
        and effective temperature as starting values. \textbackslash
        Results: In this work we use our new calibration (rms = 0.08
        dex) to study the planet-metallicity relation of our sample. The
        well-known correlation for giant planet FGKM hosts with
        metallicity is present. Regarding Neptunians and smaller hosts
        no correlation is found but there is a hint that an anti-
        correlation with [Fe/H] may exist. We combined our sample with
        the California Planet Survey late-K and M-type dwarf sample to
        increase our statistics but found no new trends. We fitted a
        power law to the frequency histogram of the Jovian hosts for our
        sample and for the combined sample, f$_{p}$ =
        C10$^{{\ensuremath{\alpha}} [Fe/H] }$, using two different
        approaches: a direct bin fitting and a Bayesian fitting
        procedure. We obtained a value for C between 0.02 and 0.04 and
        for {\ensuremath{\alpha}} between 1.26 and 2.94. Regarding
        stellar mass, an hypothetical correlation with planets was
        discovered, but was found to be the result of a detection bias.

	Abstract = {{Context. Gaia Data Release 1 allows the recalibration of standard
        candles such as the red clump stars. To use those stars, they
        first need to be accurately characterised. In particular,
        colours are needed to derive interstellar extinction. As no
        filter is available for the first Gaia data release and to avoid
        the atmosphere model mismatch, an empirical calibration is
        unavoidable. \textbackslash Aims: The purpose of this work is to
        provide the first complete and robust photometric empirical
        calibration of the Gaia red clump stars of the solar
        neighbourhood through colour-colour, effective temperature-
        colour, and absolute magnitude-colour relations from the Gaia,
        Johnson, 2MASS, HIPPARCOS, Tycho-2, APASS-SLOAN, and WISE
        photometric systems, and the APOGEE DR13 spectroscopic
        temperatures. \textbackslash Methods: We used a 3D extinction
        map to select low reddening red giants. To calibrate the colour-
        colour and the effective temperature-colour relations, we
        developed a MCMC method that accounts for all variable
        uncertainties and selects the best model for each photometric
        relation. We estimated the red clump absolute magnitude through
        the mode of a kernel-based distribution function. \textbackslash
        Results: We provide 20 colour versus G-K$_{s}$ relations and the
        first T$_{eff}$ versus G-K$_{s}$ calibration. We obtained the
        red clump absolute magnitudes for 15 photometric bands with, in
        particular, M$_{K<SUB>s}$</SUB> = (-1.606 {\ensuremath{\pm}}

@article{mac_low_2004,
	Abstract = {{Understanding the formation of stars in galaxies is central to much of
        modern astrophysics. However, a quantitative prediction of the
        star formation rate and the initial distribution of stellar
        masses remains elusive. For several decades it has been thought
        that the star formation process is primarily controlled by the
        interplay between gravity and magnetostatic support, modulated
        by neutral-ion drift (known as ambipolar diffusion in
        astrophysics). Recently, however, both observational and
        numerical work has begun to suggest that supersonic turbulent
        flows rather than static magnetic fields control star formation.
        To some extent, this represents a return to ideas popular before
        the importance of magnetic fields to the interstellar gas was
        fully appreciated. This review gives a historical overview of
        the successes and problems of both the classical dynamical
        theory and the standard theory of magnetostatic support, from
        both observational and theoretical perspectives. The outline of
        a new theory relying on control by driven supersonic turbulence
        is then presented. Numerical models demonstrate that, although
        supersonic turbulence can provide global support, it
        nevertheless produces density enhancements that allow local
        collapse. Inefficient, isolated star formation is a hallmark of
        turbulent support, while efficient, clustered star formation
        occurs in its absence. The consequences of this theory are then
        explored for both local star formation and galactic-scale star
        formation. It suggests that individual star-forming cores are
        likely not quasistatic objects, but dynamically collapsing.
        Accretion onto these objects varies depending on the properties
        of the surrounding turbulent flow; numerical models agree with
        observations showing decreasing rates. The initial mass
        distribution of stars may also be determined by the turbulent
        flow. Molecular clouds appear to be transient objects forming
        and dissolving in the larger-scale turbulent flow, or else
        quickly collapsing into regions of violent star formation.
        Global star formation in galaxies appears to be controlled by
        the same balance between gravity and turbulence as small-scale
        star formation, although modulated by cooling and differential
        rotation. The dominant driving mechanism in star-forming regions
        of galaxies appears to be supernovae, while elsewhere coupling
        of rotation to the gas through magnetic fields or gravity may be
        important.}},

	Abstract = {{Context. The origin of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) is one of
        the most debated issues in astrophysics. \textbackslash Aims:
        Here we explore the possible link between the quasi-universal
        filamentary structure of star-forming molecular clouds and the
        origin of the IMF. \textbackslash Methods: Based on our recent
        comprehensive study of filament properties from Herschel Gould
        Belt survey observations, we derive, for the first time, a good
        estimate of the filament mass function (FMF) and filament line
        mass function (FLMF) in nearby molecular clouds. We use the
        observed FLMF to propose a simple toy model for the origin of
        the prestellar core mass function (CMF), relying on
        gravitational fragmentation of thermally supercritical but
        virialized filaments. \textbackslash Results: We find that the
        FMF and the FLMF have very similar shapes and are both
        consistent with a Salpeter-like power-law function (dN/dlog
        M$_{line}$ {\ensuremath{\propto}}
        M$_{line}$$^{-1.5{\ensuremath{\pm}}0.1}$) in the regime of
        thermally supercritical filaments (M$_{line}$ > 16
        M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ pc$^{-1}$). This is a remarkable
        result since, in contrast, the mass distribution of molecular
        clouds and clumps is known to be significantly shallower than
        the Salpeter power-law IMF, with dN/dlog M$_{cl}$
        {\ensuremath{\propto}} M$_{cl}$$^{-0.7}$. \textbackslash
        Conclusions: Since the vast majority of prestellar cores appear
        to form in thermally transcritical or supercritical filaments,
        we suggest that the prestellar CMF and by extension the stellar
        IMF are at least partly inherited from the FLMF through
        gravitational fragmentation of individual filaments.}},

        boundary conditions of the star-formation process. The Herschel
        results emphasize the role of interstellar filaments in the
        star-formation process and connect remarkably well with nearly a
        decade{\textquoteright}s worth of numerical simulations and
        theory that have consistently shown that the interstellar medium

        formation is intimately related to self-gravitating filaments.
        In this review, we trace how the apparent complexity of cloud

        earths with Near-infrared and optical Echelle Spectrographs
        (CARMENES) survey is searching for Earth-like planets orbiting M
        dwarfs using the radial velocity method. Studying the stellar
        activity of the target stars is important to avoid false planet
        detections and to improve our understanding of the atmospheres
        of late-type stars. \textbackslash Aims: In this work we present
        measurements of activity indicators at visible and near-infrared
        wavelengths for 331 M dwarfs observed with CARMENES. Our aim is
        to identify the activity indicators that are most sensitive and
        easiest to measure, and the correlations among these indicators.
        We also wish to characterise their variability. \textbackslash
        Methods: Using a spectral subtraction technique, we measured
        pseudo-equivalent widths of the He I D$_{3}$,
        H{\ensuremath{\alpha}}, He I {\ensuremath{\lambda}}10833
        {\r{A}}, and Pa {\ensuremath{\beta}} lines, the Na I D doublet,
        and the Ca II infrared triplet, which have a chromospheric
        component in active M dwarfs. In addition, we measured an index
        of the strength of two TiO and two VO bands, which are formed in
        the photosphere. We also searched for periodicities in these
        activity indicators for all sample stars using generalised Lomb-
        Scargle periodograms. \textbackslash Results: We find that the
        most slowly rotating stars of each spectral subtype have the
        strongest H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} absorption.
        H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} is correlated most strongly with He I
        D$_{3}$, whereas Na I D and the Ca II infrared triplet are also
        correlated with H{\ensuremath{\alpha}}. He I
        {\ensuremath{\lambda}}10833 {\r{A}} and Pa{\ensuremath{\beta}}
        show no clear correlations with the other indicators. The TiO
        bands show an activity effect that does not appear in the VO
        bands. We find that the relative variations of
        H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} and He I D$_{3}$ are smaller for stars
        with higher activity levels, while this anti-correlation is
        weaker for Na I D and the Ca II infrared triplet, and is absent
        for He I {\ensuremath{\lambda}}10833 {\r{A}} and
        Pa{\ensuremath{\beta}}. Periodic variation with the rotation
        period most commonly appears in the TiO bands,

	Abstract = {{We have performed an abundance analysis for F- and G- dwarfs of the
        Galactic thick-disc component. A sample of 176 nearby (d<=
        150pc) thick-disc candidate stars was chosen from the Hipparcos
        catalogue and subjected to a high-resolution spectroscopic
        analysis. Using accurate radial velocities combined with the
        Hipparcos astrometry, kinematics (U, V and W) and Galactic
        orbital parameters were computed. We estimate the probability
        for a star to belong to the thin disc, the thick disc or the
        halo. With a probability P>= 70 per cent taken as certain
        membership, we assigned 95 stars to the thick disc, 13 to the
        thin disc, and 20 to the halo. The remaining 48 stars in the
        sample cannot be assigned with reasonable certainty to one of
        the three components. \textbackslash\textbackslashAbundances of
        C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn,
        Y, Ba, Ce, Nd and Eu have been obtained. The abundances for the
        thick-disc stars are compared with those for the thin-disc
        members from Reddy et al. The ratios of
        {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-elements (O, Mg, Si, Ca and Ti) to iron
        for thick-disc stars show a clear enhancement compared to thin-
        disc members in the range -0.3 < [Fe/H] < -1.2. There are also
        other elements - Al, Sc, V, Co, and possibly Zn - which show
        enhanced ratios to iron in the thick disc relative to the thin
        disc. The abundances of Na, Cr, Mn, Ni and Cu (relative to Fe)
        are very similar for thin- and thick-disc stars. The dispersion
        in abundance ratios [X/Fe] at given [Fe/H] for thick-disc stars
        is consistent with the expected scatter due to measurement
        errors, suggesting a lack of `cosmic' scatter.
        \textbackslash\textbackslashA few stars classified as members of
        the thick disc by our kinematic criteria show thin-disc
        abundances. These stars, which appear older than most thin-disc
        stars, are also, on average, younger than the thick-disc
        population. They may have originated early in the thin-disc
        history, and been subsequently scattered to hotter orbits by
        collisions. The thick disc may not include stars with [Fe/H] >
        -0.3. The observed compositions of the thin and thick discs seem
        to be consistent with the models of galaxy formation by
        hierarchical clustering in a Lambda cold dark matter
        ({\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM) universe.}},

	Abstract = {{It is well established that the chemical structure of the Milky Way
        exhibits a bimodality with respect to the
        {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-enhancement of stars at a given [Fe/H].
        This has been studied largely based on a bulk
        {\ensuremath{\alpha}} abundance, computed as a summary of
        several individual {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-elements. Inspired by
        the expected subtle differences in their nucleosynthetic
        origins, here we probe the higher level of granularity encoded
        in the inter-family [Mg/Si] abundance ratio. Using a large
        sample of stars with APOGEE abundance measurements, we first
        demonstrate that there is additional information in this ratio
        beyond what is already apparent in [{\ensuremath{\alpha}}/Fe]
        and [Fe/H] alone. We then consider Gaia astrometry and stellar
        age estimates to empirically characterize the relationships
        between [Mg/Si] and various stellar properties. We find small
        but significant trends between this ratio and
        {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-enhancement, age, [Fe/H], location in the
        Galaxy, and orbital actions. To connect these observed [Mg/Si]
        variations to a physical origin, we attempt to predict the Mg
        and Si abundances of stars with the galactic chemical evolution
        model Chempy. We find that we are unable to reproduce abundances
        for the stars that we fit, which highlights tensions between the
        yield tables, the chemical evolution model, and the data. We
        conclude that a more data-driven approach to nucleosynthetic
        yield tables and chemical evolution modeling is necessary to
        maximize insights from large spectroscopic surveys.}},

        observations of stellar populations increase the need for
        theoretical models in regions of age-composition parameter space
        that are largely unexplored at present. Stellar evolution models
        that employ the most advanced physics and cover a wide range of
        compositions are needed to extract the most information from
        current observations of both resolved and unresolved stellar
        populations. The Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Database is a
        collection of stellar evolution tracks and isochrones that spans
        a range of [Fe/H] from -2.5 to +0.5, [{\ensuremath{\alpha}}/Fe]
        from -0.2 to +0.8 (for [Fe/H] <= 0) or +0.2 (for [Fe/H] > 0),
        and initial He mass fractions from Y = 0.245 to 0.40. Stellar
        evolution tracks were computed for masses between 0.1 and 4
        M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$, allowing isochrones to be generated
        for ages as young as 250 Myr. For the range in masses where the
        core He flash occurs, separate He-burning tracks were computed
        starting from the zero age horizontal branch. The tracks and
        isochrones have been transformed to the observational plane in a

        Way. The population synthesis approach is a useful tool to
        interpret such data sets and to test scenarios of evolution of
        the Galaxy. We present here new constraints on evolution
        parameters obtained from the Besan{\c{c}}on model of population
        synthesis and analysis of optical and near-infrared star counts.
        The Galactic potential is computed self-consistently, in
        agreement with Hipparcos results and the observed rotation
        curve. Constraints are posed on the outer bulge structure, the
        warped and flared disc, the thick disc and the spheroid
        populations. The model is tuned to produce reliable predictions
        in the visible and the near-infrared in wide photometric bands

        parameters of M dwarfs from spectra secured with SPIRou, the
        near-infrared high-resolution spectropolarimeter installed at
        the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), in the framework of
        the SPIRou Legacy Survey (SLS). Our study relies on comparing
        observed spectra with two grids of synthetic spectra,
        respectively, computed from PHOENIX and MARCS model atmospheres,
        with the ultimate goal of optimizing the precision at which
        fundamental parameters can be determined. In this first step, we
        applied our technique to 12 inactive M dwarfs with effective
        temperatures (T$_{eff}$) ranging from 3000 to 4000 K. We
        implemented a benchmark to carry out a comparison of the two
        models used in this study. We report that the choice of model
        has a significant impact on the results and may lead to
        discrepancies in the derived parameters of 30 K in T$_{eff}$ and
        0.05 dex to 0.10 dex in surface gravity (log g) and metallicity
        ($\rm {[M/H]}$), as well as systematic shifts of up to 50 K in
        T$_{eff}$ and 0.4 dex log g and $\rm {[M/H]}$. The analysis is
        performed on high signal-to-noise ratio template SPIRou spectra,

	Abstract = {{We present fundamental parameters for 110 canonical K- and M-type
        (1.3-0.13 M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$) Taurus-Auriga young
        stellar objects (YSOs). The analysis produces a simultaneous
        determination of effective temperature (T$_{eff}$), surface
        gravity (log g), magnetic-field strength (B), and projected
        rotational velocity ( $v\sin i$ ). Our method employed synthetic
        spectra and high-resolution (R \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde
        45,000) near-infrared spectra taken with the Immersion GRating
        INfrared Spectrometer (IGRINS) to fit specific K-band spectral
        regions most sensitive to those parameters. The use of these
        high-resolution spectra reduces the influence of distance
        uncertainties, reddening, and non-photospheric continuum
        emission on the parameter determinations. The median total (fit
        + systematic) uncertainties were 170 K, 0.28 dex, 0.60 kG, 2.5
        km s$^{-1}$ for T$_{eff}$, log g, B, and $v\sin i$ ,
        respectively. We determined B for 41 Taurus YSOs (upper limits
        for the remainder) and find systematic offsets (lower T$_{eff}$,
        higher log g and $v\sin i$ ) in parameters when B is measurable
        but not considered in the fit. The average log g for the Class
        II and Class III objects differs by 0.23 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.05
        dex, which is consistent with Class III objects being the more
        evolved members of the star-forming region. However, the
        dispersion in log g is greater than the uncertainties, which
        highlights how the YSO classification correlates with age (log
        g), yet there are exceptionally young (lower log g) Class III
        YSOs and relatively old (higher log g) Class II YSOs with
        unexplained evolutionary histories. The spectra from this work
        are provided in an online repository along with TW Hydrae
        Association comparison objects and the model grid used in our
        analysis.}},

@article{shulyak_2014,
	Abstract = {{Context. Magnetic fields play a pivotal role in the formation and
        evolution of low-mass stars, but the dynamo mechanisms
        generating these fields are poorly understood. Measuring cool
        star magnetism is a complicated task because of the complexity
        of cool star spectra and the subtle signatures of magnetic
        fields. \textbackslash Aims: Based on detailed spectral
        synthesis, we carry out quantitative measurements of the
        strength and complexity of surface magnetic fields in the four
        well-known M dwarfs <ASTROBJ>GJ 388</ASTROBJ>, <ASTROBJ>GJ
        729</ASTROBJ>, <ASTROBJ>GJ 285</ASTROBJ>, and <ASTROBJ>GJ
        406</ASTROBJ> that populate the mass regime around the boundary
        between partially and fully convective stars. Very high-
        resolution (R = 100 000), high signal-to-noise (up to 400),
        near-infrared Stokes I spectra were obtained with CRIRES at
        ESO's Very Large Telescope covering regions of the FeH Wing-Ford
        transitions at 1{\ensuremath{\mu}}m and Na i lines at
        2.2{\ensuremath{\mu}}m. \textbackslash Methods: A modified
        version of the Molecular Zeeman Library (MZL) was used to
        compute Land{\'e} g-factors for FeH lines. We determined the
        distribution of magnetic fields by magnetic spectral synthesis
        performed with the Synmast code. We tested two different
        magnetic geometries to probe the influence of field orientation
        effects. \textbackslash Results: Our analysis confirms that FeH
        lines are excellent indicators of surface magnetic fields in
        low-mass stars of type M, particularly in comparison to profiles
        of Na i lines that are heavily affected by water lines and that
        suffer problems with continuum normalization. The field
        distributions in all four stars are characterized by three
        distinct groups of field components, and the data are consistent
        neither with a smooth distribution of different field strengths
        nor with one average field strength covering the full star. We
        find evidence of a subtle difference in the field distribution
        of GJ 285 compared to the other three targets. GJ 285 also has
        the highest average field of 3.5 kG and the strongest maximum
        field component of 7-7.5 kG. The maximum local field strengths
        in our sample seem to be correlated with rotation rate. While
        the average field strength is saturated, the maximum local field
        strengths in our sample show no evidence of saturation.
        \textbackslash Conclusions: We find no difference between the
        field distributions of partially and fully convective stars. The
        one star with evidence of field distribution different from the
        other three is the most active star (i.e. with X-ray luminosity
        and mean surface magnetic field) rotating relatively fast. A
        possible explanation is that rotation determines the
        distribution of surface magnetic fields, and that local field
        strengths grow with rotation even in stars in which the average
        field is already saturated. \textbackslash\textbackslashBased on

	Abstract = {{Stellar dynamos generate magnetic fields that are of fundamental
        importance to the variability and evolution of Sun-like and low-
        mass stars, and for the development of their planetary systems.
        We report measurements of surface-average magnetic fields in 292
        M dwarfs from a comparison with radiative transfer calculations;
        for 260 of them, this is the first measurement of this kind. Our
        data were obtained from more than 15,000 high-resolution spectra
        taken during the CARMENES project. They reveal a relation
        between average field strength, <B>, and Rossby number, $Ro$,
        resembling the well-studied rotation-activity relation. Among
        the slowly rotating stars, we find that magnetic flux,
        $\Phi_\textrm{B}$, is proportional to rotation period, $P$, and
        among the rapidly rotating stars that average surface fields do
        not grow significantly beyond the level set by the available
        kinetic energy. Furthermore, we find close relations between
        nonthermal coronal X-ray emission, chromospheric H$\alpha$ and
        Ca H\&K emission, and magnetic flux. Taken together, these
        relations demonstrate empirically that the rotation-activity
        relation can be traced back to a dependence of the magnetic
        dynamo on rotation. We advocate the picture that the magnetic
        dynamo generates magnetic flux on the stellar surface
        proportional to rotation rate with a saturation limit set by the
        available kinetic energy, and we provide relations for average
        field strengths and nonthermal emission that are independent of
        the choice of the convective turnover time. We also find that Ca
        H\&K emission saturates at average field strengths of $\langle B
        \rangle \approx 800$ G while H$\alpha$ and X-ray emission grow
        further with stronger fields in the more rapidly rotating stars.
        This is in conflict with the coronal stripping scenario
        predicting that in the most rapidly rotating stars coronal
        plasma would be cooled to chromospheric temperatures.}},

	Abstract = {{AU Mic is a young, very active M dwarf star with a debris disk and at
        least one transiting Neptune-size planet. Here we present a
        detailed analysis of the magnetic field of AU Mic based on
        previously unpublished high-resolution optical and near-infrared
        spectropolarimetric observations. We report a systematic
        detection of circular and linear polarization signatures in the
        stellar photospheric lines. Tentative Zeeman Doppler imaging
        modeling of the former data suggests a nonaxisymmetric global
        field with a surface-averaged strength of about 90 G. At the
        same time, linear polarization observations indicate the
        presence of a much stronger ≍2 kG axisymmetric dipolar field,
        which contributes no circular polarization signal due to the
        equator-on orientation of AU Mic. A separate Zeeman broadening
        and intensification analysis allowed us to determine a mean
        field modulus of 2.3 and 2.1 kG from the Y- and K-band atomic
        lines, respectively. These magnetic field measurements are
        essential for understanding environmental conditions within the

        December) from the high-resolution near-infrared Apache Point
        Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE)-2/Sloan
        Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)-IV survey are described. Compared to
        the previous APOGEE data release (DR14; 2017 July), APOGEE DR16
        includes about 200,000 new stellar spectra, of which 100,000 are
        from a new southern APOGEE instrument mounted on the 2.5 m du
        Pont telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. DR16
        includes all data taken up to 2018 August, including data
        released in previous data releases. All of the data have been
        re-reduced and re-analyzed using the latest pipelines, resulting
        in a total of 473,307 spectra of 437,445 stars. Changes to the
        analysis methods for this release include, but are not limited
        to, the use of MARCS model atmospheres for calculation of the
        entire main grid of synthetic spectra used in the analysis, a
        new method for filling ``holes'' in the grids due to unconverged
        model atmospheres, and a new scheme for continuum normalization.
        Abundances of the neutron-capture element Ce are included for
        the first time. A new scheme for estimating uncertainties of the
        derived quantities using stars with multiple observations has
        been applied, and calibrated values of surface gravities for
        dwarf stars are now supplied. Compared to DR14, the radial
        velocities derived for this release more closely match those in
        the Gaia DR2 database, and a clear improvement in the spectral
        analysis of the coolest giants can be seen. The reduced spectra
        as well as the result of the analysis can be downloaded using
        links provided on the SDSS DR16 web page.}},

	Abstract = {{Barnard's star is a red dwarf, and has the largest proper motion
        (apparent motion across the sky) of all known stars. At a
        distance of 1.8 parsecs$^{1}$, it is the closest single star to
        the Sun; only the three stars in the {\ensuremath{\alpha}}
        Centauri system are closer. Barnard's star is also among the
        least magnetically active red dwarfs known$^{2,3}$ and has an
        estimated age older than the Solar System. Its properties make
        it a prime target for planetary searches; various techniques
        with different sensitivity limits have been used previously,
        including radial-velocity imaging$^{4-6}$, astrometry$^{7,8}$
        and direct imaging$^{9}$, but all ultimately led to negative or
        null results. Here we combine numerous measurements from high-
        precision radial-velocity instruments, revealing the presence of
        a low-amplitude periodic signal with a period of 233 days.
        Independent photometric and spectroscopic monitoring, as well as
        an analysis of instrumental systematic effects, suggest that
        this signal is best explained as arising from a planetary
        companion. The candidate planet around Barnard's star is a cold
        super-Earth, with a minimum mass of 3.2 times that of Earth,
        orbiting near its snow line (the minimum distance from the star
        at which volatile compounds could condense). The combination of
        all radial-velocity datasets spanning 20 years of measurements
        additionally reveals a long-term modulation that could arise
        from a stellar magnetic-activity cycle or from a more distant
        planetary object. Because of its proximity to the Sun, the
        candidate planet has a maximum angular separation of 220
        milliarcseconds from Barnard's star, making it an excellent
        target for direct imaging and astrometric observations in the
        future.}},

	Abstract = {{Experimental capabilities of molecular spectroscopy and its applications
        nowadays require a sub-percent or even sub-per mille accuracy of
        the representation of the shapes of molecular transitions. This
        implies the necessity of using more advanced line-shape models
        which are characterized by many more parameters than a simple
        Voigt profile. It is a great challenge for modern molecular
        spectral databases to store and maintain the extended set of
        line-shape parameters as well as their temperature dependences.
        It is even more challenging to reliably retrieve these
        parameters from experimental spectra over a large range of
        pressures and temperatures. In this paper we address this
        problem starting from the case of the H$_{2}$ molecule for which
        the non-Voigt line-shape effects are exceptionally pronounced.
        For this purpose we reanalyzed the experimental data reported in
        the literature. In particular, we performed detailed line-shape
        analysis of high-quality spectra obtained with cavity-enhanced
        techniques. We also report the first high-quality cavity-
        enhanced measurement of the H$_{2}$ fundamental vibrational
        mode. We develop a correction to the Hartmann-Tran profile (HTP)
        which adjusts the HTP to the particular model of the velocity-
        changing collisions. This allows the measured spectra to be
        better represented over a wide range of pressures. The problem
        of storing the HTP parameters in the HITRAN database together
        with their temperature dependences is also discussed.}},

@article{qu_1999,
	Abstract = {{The problem of line formation in stellar atmospheres is studied in terms of contribution functions. The correlation between the contribution from atmospheric layers to an emergent quantity and the line formation process is explored in the case of absorption lines for unpolarized light, while the case of polarized light will be considered in a forthcoming paper. We use four contribution functions derived from two (differential and integral) formal solutions to the radiative transfer equations for emergent specific intensity and line depression respectively. Two kinds of model atmosphere are employed to investigate the wavelength dependence of these contribution functions. One is artificial, and gives the restricted distribution of line absorbers in tenuous layers, while the other represents a more realistic stellar atmosphere in which line absorption and emission are ubiquitous.It is found in the artificial model that the line formation region is indicated only by the levels that provide a dominant contribution to the line core that is distinguishable from the contribution to the continuum, for the contribution functions that describe the contribution of the layer to the specific intensity at the surface. For those functions that denote the contribution to line depression, the formation layers can be more directly determined, but sometimes the original meaning of the contribution function is lost. Thus the depth distribution of the contribution and the line formation process should be carefully connected. For the contribution functions calculated in both types of model, they show a common feature: around the line centre there is a formation core the main contribution region of which delineates the line core formation region. Its width is related to a depth-averaged Doppler width, and all wavelength points within the core form in the same region. For the Mg i 5172.7 line forming in the solar umbral atmosphere, the formation core forms separately from the far wings, mainly as a result of the solar temperature stratification. Finally, the line core formation region is not influenced by the distribution of line-of-sight velocities, while the formation region of the line wings is affected by these velocities.}},

	Abstract = {{This paper gives an overview of the CARMENES instrument and of the
        survey that will be carried out with it during the first years
        of operation. CARMENES (Calar Alto high-Resolution search for M
        dwarfs with Exoearths with Near-infrared and optical Echelle
        Spectrographs) is a next-generation radial-velocity instrument
        under construction for the 3.5m telescope at the Calar Alto
        Observatory by a consortium of eleven Spanish and German
        institutions. The scientific goal of the project is conducting a
        600-night exoplanet survey targeting
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 300 M dwarfs with the completed
        instrument. The CARMENES instrument consists of two separate
        echelle spectrographs covering the wavelength range from 0.55 to
        1.7 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m at a spectral resolution of R = 82,000,
        fed by fibers from the Cassegrain focus of the telescope. The
        spectrographs are housed in vacuum tanks providing the
        temperature-stabilized environments necessary to enable a 1 m/s
        radial velocity precision employing a simultaneous calibration
        with an emission-line lamp or with a Fabry-Perot etalon. For
        mid-M to late-M spectral types, the wavelength range around 1.0
        {\ensuremath{\mu}}m (Y band) is the most important wavelength
        region for radial velocity work. Therefore, the efficiency of
        CARMENES has been optimized in this range. The CARMENES
        instrument consists of two spectrographs, one equipped with a 4k
        x 4k pixel CCD for the range 0.55 - 1.05 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m,
        and one with two 2k x 2k pixel HgCdTe detectors for the range
        from 0.95 - 1.7{\ensuremath{\mu}}m. Each spectrograph will be
        coupled to the 3.5m telescope with two optical fibers, one for
        the target, and one for calibration light. The front end
        contains a dichroic beam splitter and an atmospheric dispersion
        corrector, to feed the light into the fibers leading to the
        spectrographs. Guiding is performed with a separate camera; on-
        axis as well as off-axis guiding modes are implemented. Fibers
        with octagonal cross-section are employed to ensure good
        stability of the output in the presence of residual guiding
        errors. The fibers are continually actuated to reduce modal
        noise. The spectrographs are mounted on benches inside vacuum
        tanks located in the coud{\'e} laboratory of the 3.5m dome. Each
        vacuum tank is equipped with a temperature stabilization system
        capable of keeping the temperature constant to within
        +/-0.01{\textdegree}C over 24 hours. The visible-light
        spectrograph will be operated near room temperature, while the
        near-IR spectrograph will be cooled to
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 140 K. The CARMENES instrument
        passed its final design review in February 2013. The MAIV phase
        is currently ongoing. First tests at the telescope are scheduled
        for early 2015. Completion of the full instrument is planned for
        the fall of 2015. At least 600 useable nights have been
        allocated at the Calar Alto 3.5m Telescope for the CARMENES
        survey in the time frame until 2018. A data base of M stars
        (dubbed CARMENCITA) has been compiled from which the CARMENES
        sample can be selected. CARMENCITA contains information on all
        relevant properties of the potential targets. Dedicated imaging,
        photometric, and spectroscopic observations are underway to
        provide crucial data on these stars that are not available in
        the literature.}},

	Abstract = {{In an attempt to widen access to the study of magnetic fields in stellar
        astronomy, I present MOOGStokes, a version of the MOOG one-
        dimensional local thermodynamic equilibrium radiative transfer
        code, overhauled to incorporate a Stokes vector treatment of
        polarized radiation through a magnetic medium. MOOGStokes is a
        suite of three complementary programs, which together can
        synthesize the disk-averaged emergent spectrum of a star with a
        magnetic field. The first element (a pre-processing script
        called CounterPoint) calculates for a given magnetic field
        strength, wavelength shifts, and polarizations for the
        components of Zeeman-sensitive lines. The second element (a MOOG
        driver called SynStokes derived from the existing MOOG driver
        Synth) uses the list of Zeeman-shifted absorption lines together
        with the existing machinery of MOOG to synthesize the emergent
        spectrum at numerous locations across the stellar disk,
        accounting for stellar and magnetic field geometry. The third
        and final element (a post-processing script called DiskoBall)
        calculates the disk-averaged spectrum by weighting the
        individual emergent spectra by limb darkening and projected
        area, and applying the effects of Doppler broadening. All
        together, the MOOGStokes package allows users to synthesize
        emergent spectra of stars with magnetic fields in a familiar
        computational framework. MOOGStokes produces disk-averaged
        spectra for all Stokes vectors ( I, Q, U, V ), normalized by the
        continuum. MOOGStokes agrees well with the predictions of
        INVERS10 a polarized radiative transfer code with a long history
        of use in the study of stellar magnetic fields. In the non-
        magnetic limit, MOOGStokes also agrees with the predictions of
        the scalar version of MOOG.}},

        stars-defined as less than 0.8 M $_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$-in
        detached eclipsing binaries (DEBs). We evaluate this hypothesis
        using the magnetic Dartmouth stellar evolution code. Results
        suggest that magnetic suppression of thermal convection can
        inflate low-mass stars that possess a radiative core and
        convective outer envelope. A scaling relation between X-ray
        luminosity and surface magnetic flux indicates that model
        surface magnetic field strength predictions are consistent with
        observations. This supports the notion that magnetic fields may
        be inflating these stars. However, magnetic models are unable to
        reproduce radii of fully convective stars in DEBs. Instead, we
        propose that model discrepancies below the fully convective

	Abstract = {{Rotation periods obtained with the Kepler satellite have been combined
        with precise measurements of projected rotation velocity from
        the WIYN 3.5-m telescope to determine the distribution of
        projected radii for several hundred low-mass (0.1
        {\ensuremath{\leq}} M/M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$
        {\ensuremath{\leq}} 0.8), fast-rotating members of the Pleiades
        cluster. A maximum likelihood modelling technique, that takes
        account of observational uncertainties, selection effects and
        censored data, and considers the effects of differential
        rotation and unresolved binarity, has been used to find that the
        average radius of these stars is 14 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 2 per
        cent larger at a given luminosity than predicted by current
        evolutionary models of Dotter et al. and Baraffe et al. The same
        models are a reasonable match to the interferometric radii of
        older, magnetically inactive field M dwarfs, suggesting that the
        over-radius may be associated with the young, magnetically
        active nature of the Pleiades objects. No evidence is found for
        any change in this over-radius above and below the boundary
        marking the transition to full convection. Published
        evolutionary models that incorporate either the effects of
        magnetic inhibition of convection or the blocking of flux by
        dark star-spots do not individually explain the radius
        inflation, but a combination of the two effects might. The
        distribution of projected radii is consistent with the adopted
        hypothesis of a random spatial orientation of spin axes; strong
        alignments of the spin vectors into cones with an opening semi-
        angle <30{\textdegree} can be ruled out. Any plausible but

	Abstract = {{Context. The relevance of M dwarfs in the search for potentially
        habitable Earth-sized planets has grown significantly in the
        last years. \textbackslash Aims: In our on-going effort to
        comprehensively and accurately characterise confirmed and
        potential planet-hosting M dwarfs, in particular for the
        CARMENES survey, we have carried out a comprehensive multi-band
        photometric analysis involving spectral energy distributions,
        luminosities, absolute magnitudes, colours, and spectral types,
        from which we have derived basic astrophysical parameters.
        \textbackslash Methods: We have carefully compiled photometry in
        20 passbands from the ultraviolet to the mid-infrared, and
        combined it with the latest parallactic distances and close-
        multiplicity information, mostly from Gaia DR2, of a sample of
        2479 K5 V to L8 stars and ultracool dwarfs, including 2210
        nearby, bright M dwarfs. For this, we made extensive use of
        Virtual Observatory tools. \textbackslash Results: We have
        homogeneously computed accurate bolometric luminosities and
        effective temperatures of 1843 single stars, derived their radii
        and masses, studied the impact of metallicity, and compared our
        results with the literature. The over 40 000 individually
        inspected magnitudes, together with the basic data and derived
        parameters of the stars, individual and averaged by spectral
        type, have been made public to the astronomical community. In
        addition, we have reported 40 new close multiple systems and
        candidates ({\ensuremath{\rho}} < 3.3 arcsec) and 36
        overluminous stars that are assigned to young Galactic
        populations. \textbackslash Conclusions: In the new era of
        exoplanet searches around M dwarfs via transit (e.g. TESS,
        PLATO) and radial velocity (e.g. CARMENES, NIRPS+HARPS), this
        work is of fundamental importance for stellar and therefore
        planetary parameter determination.

        Myr old pre-main-sequence (pre-MS) stars using the F0- through

        {\ensuremath{\eta}} Cha cluster, the TW Hydra Association, the
        {\ensuremath{\beta}} Pic Moving Group, and the Tucana-Horologium
        Association. To check the consistency of spectral types from the
        literature, we estimate new spectral types for 52 nearby pre-MS
        stars with spectral types F3 through M4 using optical spectra
        taken with the SMARTS 1.5 m telescope. Combining these new types
        with published spectral types and photometry from the literature
        (Johnson-Cousins BVI$_{C}$ , 2MASS JHK$_{S}$ and WISE W1, W2,
        W3, and W4), we derive a new empirical spectral type-color
        sequence for 5-30 Myr old pre-MS stars. Colors for pre-MS stars
        match dwarf colors for some spectral types and colors, but for
        other spectral types and colors, deviations can exceed 0.3 mag.
        We estimate effective temperatures (T $_{eff}$) and bolometric
        corrections (BCs) for our pre-MS star sample through comparing
        their photometry to synthetic photometry generated using the BT-
        Settl grid of model atmosphere spectra. We derive a new T
        $_{eff}$ and BC scale for pre-MS stars, which should be a more
        appropriate match for T Tauri stars than often-adopted dwarf
        star scales. While our new T $_{eff}$ scale for pre-MS stars is
        within sime100 K of dwarfs at a given spectral type for stars
        <G5, for G5 through K6, the pre-MS stars are
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde250 K cooler than their MS

        optical/IR color, and BC sequence for O9V-M9V MS stars based on
        an extensive literature survey, (2) a revised Q-method relation

	Abstract = {{Since the discovery of brown dwarfs in 1994, and the discovery of dust
        cloud formation in the latest Very Low Mass Stars (VLMs) and
        Brown Dwarfs (BDs) in 1996, the most important challenge in
        modeling their atmospheres as become the understanding of cloud
        formation and advective mixing. For this purpose, we have
        developed radiation hydrodynamic 2D model atmosphere simulations
        to study the formation of forsterite dust in presence of
        advection, condensation, and sedimentation across the M-L-T VLMs
        to BDs sequence (T$_{eff}$ = 2800 K to 900 K, Freytag et al.
        2010). We discovered the formation of gravity waves as a driving
        mechanism for the formation of clouds in these atmospheres, and
        derived a rule for the velocity field versus atmospheric depth
        and T$_{eff}$, which is relatively insensitive to gravity. This
        rule has been used in the construction of the new model
        atmosphere grid, BT-Settl, to determine the micro-turbulence
        velocity, the diffusion coefficient, and the advective mixing of
        molecules as a function of depth. This new model grid of
        atmospheres and synthetic spectra has been computed for 100,000
        K > T$_{eff}$ > 400 K, 5.5 > logg > -0.5, and [M/H]= +0.5 to
        -1.5, and the reference solar abundances of Asplund et al.
        (2009). We found that the new solar abundances allow an improved
        (close to perfect) reproduction of the photometric and
        spectroscopic VLMs properties, and, for the first time, a smooth
        transition between stellar and substellar regimes -- unlike the
        transition between the NextGen models from Hauschildt et al.
        1999a,b, and the AMES-Dusty models from Allard et al. 2001. In
        the BDs regime, the BT-Settl models propose an improved
        explanation for the M-L-T spectral transition. In this paper, we
        therefore present the new BT-Settl model atmosphere grid, which
        explains the entire transition from the stellar to planetary
        mass regimes.}},

	Abstract = {{Detailed chemical analyses of M dwarfs are scarce but necessary to
        constrain the formation environment and internal structure of
        planets being found around them. We present elemental abundances
        of 13 M dwarfs (2900 < T $_{eff}$ < 3500 K) observed in the
        Subaru/IRD planet search project. They are mid- to late-M dwarfs
        whose abundance of individual elements has not been well
        studied. We use the high-resolution
        (\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde70,000) near-infrared (970-1750
        nm) spectra to measure the abundances of Na, Mg, Si, K, Ca, Ti,
        V, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Sr by the line-by-line analysis based on
        model atmospheres, with typical errors ranging from 0.2 dex for
        [Fe/H] to 0.3-0.4 dex for other [X/H]. We measure radial
        velocities from the spectra and combine them with Gaia
        astrometry to calculate the Galactocentric space velocities UVW.
        The resulting [Fe/H] values agree with previous estimates based
        on medium-resolution K-band spectroscopy, showing a wide
        distribution of metallicity (-0.6 < [Fe/H] < +0.4). The
        abundance ratios of individual elements [X/Fe] are generally
        aligned with the solar values in all targets. While the [X/Fe]
        distributions are comparable to those of nearby FGK stars, most
        of which belong to the thin-disk population, the most metal-poor
        object, GJ 699, could be a thick-disk star. The UVW velocities
        also support this. The results raise the prospect that near-
        infrared spectra of M dwarfs obtained in the planet search
        projects can be used to grasp the trend of elemental abundances
        and the Galactic stellar population of nearby M dwarfs.}},

        Si, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Ni) are derived for a sample
        of M-dwarfs using high-resolution near-infrared $H$-band spectra
        from the SDSS-IV/APOGEE survey. The quantitative analysis
        included synthetic spectra computed with 1-D LTE plane-parallel
        MARCS models using the APOGEE DR17 line list to determine
        chemical abundances. The sample consists of eleven M-dwarfs in
        binary systems with warmer FGK-dwarf primaries and ten measured
        interferometric angular diameters. To minimize atomic diffusion
        effects, [X/Fe] ratios are used to compare M-dwarfs in binary
        systems and literature results for their warmer primary stars,
        indicating good agreement ($<$0.08 dex) for all studied
        elements. The mean abundance differences in Primaries-this work
        M-dwarfs is -0.05$\pm$0.03 dex. It indicates that M-dwarfs in
        binary systems are a reliable way to calibrate empirical
        relationships. A comparison with abundance, effective
        temperature, and surface gravity results from the ASPCAP
        pipeline (DR16) finds a systematic offset of [M/H], $T_{\rm
        eff}$, log$g$ = +0.21 dex, -50 K, and 0.30 dex, respectively,
        although ASPCAP [X/Fe] ratios are generally consistent with this
        study. The metallicities of the M dwarfs cover the range of
        [Fe/H] = -0.9 to +0.4 and are used to investigate Galactic
        chemical evolution via trends of [X/Fe] as a function of [Fe/H].
        The behavior of the various elemental abundances [X/Fe] versus
        [Fe/H] agrees well with the corresponding trends derived from
        warmer FGK-dwarfs, demonstrating that the APOGEE spectra can be
        used to Galactic chemical evolution using large samples of

        4104 lines in the 530-690 nm spectral region. It consists in the
        measurement of pseudo equivalent widths and their correlation
        with established scales of [Fe/H] and T$_{eff}$. \textbackslash
        Results: Our technique achieves a rms of 0.08 {\ensuremath{\pm}}
        0.01 for [Fe/H], 91 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 13 K for T$_{eff}$, and
        is valid in the (-0.85,0.26 dex), (2800, 4100 K), and (M0.0,
        M5.0) intervals for [Fe/H], T$_{eff}$ and spectral type
        respectively. We also calculated the RMSE$_{V}$ which estimates
        uncertainties of the order of 0.12 dex for the metallicity and
        of 293 K for the effective temperature. The technique has an
        activity limit and should only be used for stars with log

        Methods: We applied a purely chemical analysis approach based on

        various formation models. \textbackslash Results: We identified
        a gap in the [{\ensuremath{\alpha}}/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane for the
        {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-enhanced stars, and by performing a
        bootstrapped Monte Carlo test we obtained a probability higher
        than 99.99\% that this gap is not due to small-number
        statistics. Our analysis shows a negative gradient of the
        rotational velocity of the thin disk stars with [Fe/H] (-17 km
        s$^{-1}$ dex$^{-1}$), and a steep positive gradient for both the
        thick disk and h{\ensuremath{\alpha}}mr stars with the same
        magnitude of about +42 km s$^{-1}$ dex$^{-1}$. For the thin disk
        stars we observed no correlation between orbital eccentricities
        and metallicity, but observed a steep negative gradient for the
        thick disk and h{\ensuremath{\alpha}}mr stars with practically
        the same magnitude ({\ensuremath{\approx}}-0.18 dex$^{-1}$). The
        correlations observed for the nearby stars (on average 45 pc)
        using high-precision data, in general agree well with the
        results obtained for the SDSS sample of stars located farther
        from the Galactic plane. \textbackslash Conclusions: Our results
        suggest that radial migration played an important role in the
        formation and evolution of the thin disk. For the thick disk
        stars it is not possible to reach a firm conclusion about their
        origin. Based on the eccentricity distribution of the thick disk
        stars only their accretion origin can be ruled out, and the
        heating and migration scenario could explain the positive steep
        gradient of V$_{{\ensuremath{\varphi}}}$ with [Fe/H]. When we
        analyzed the h{\ensuremath{\alpha}}mr stellar population we
        found that they share properties of both the thin and thick disk
        population. A comparison of the properties of the
        h{\ensuremath{\alpha}}mr stars with those of the subsample of
        stars from the N-body/SPH simulation using radial migration
        suggest that they may have originated from the inner Galaxy.
        Further detailed investigations would help to clarify their
        exact nature and origin. \textbackslash\textbackslashBased on

	Abstract = {{Magnetic fields and mass accretion processes create dark and bright
        spots on the surface of young stars. These spots manifest as
        surface thermal inhomogeneities, which alter the global
        temperature measured on the stars. To understand the effects and
        implications of these starspots, we conducted a large iSHELL
        high-resolution infrared spectroscopic survey of T Tauri stars
        in Taurus-Auriga and Ophiuchus star-forming regions. From the K
        band spectra, we measured stellar temperatures and magnetic
        field strengths using a magnetic radiative transfer code. We
        compared our infrared-derived parameters against literature
        optical temperatures and found a) a systematic temperature
        difference between optical and infrared observations, and b) a
        positive correlation between the magnetic field strengths and
        the temperature differences. The discrepant temperature
        measurements imply significant differences in the inferred
        stellar masses from stellar evolutionary models. To discern
        which temperature better predicts the mass of the star, we
        compared our model-derived masses against dynamical masses
        measured from ALMA and PdBI for a sub-sample of our sources.
        From this comparison we conclude that, in the range of stellar
        masses from 0.3 to 1.3 $\rm M_\odot$, neither infrared nor
        optical temperatures perfectly reproduce the stellar dynamical
        masses. But, on average, infrared temperatures produce more
        precise and accurate stellar masses than optical ones.}},

        stars the most favorable targets for surveys seeking to detect
        new exoplanets. Using this advantage to identify likely low-mass
        planet hosts, however, has been difficult: until now methods to
        determine M-dwarf metallicities required observationally
        expensive data (such as parallaxes and high-resolution spectra)
        and were limited to a few bright cool stars. We have obtained
        moderate (R \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 2700) resolution
        K-band spectra of 17 M dwarfs with metallicity estimates derived
        from their FGK companions. Analysis of these spectra, and
        inspection of theoretical synthetic spectra, reveals that an M
        dwarf's metallicity can be inferred from the strength of its Na
        I doublet (2.206 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m and 2.209
        {\ensuremath{\mu}}m) and Ca I triplet (2.261
        {\ensuremath{\mu}}m, 2.263 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m, and 2.265
        {\ensuremath{\mu}}m) absorption lines. We use these features,
        and a temperature-sensitive water index, to construct an
        empirical metallicity indicator applicable for M dwarfs with
        near-solar metallicities (-0.5< [Fe/H] < +0.5). This indicator
        has an accuracy of {\ensuremath{\pm}}0.15 dex, comparable to
        that of existing techniques for estimating M-dwarf
        metallicities, but is more observationally accessible, requiring
        only a moderate resolution K-band spectrum. Applying this method
        to eight known M-dwarf planet hosts, we estimate metallicities
        ([Fe/H]) in excess of the mean metallicity of M dwarfs in the
        solar neighborhood, consistent with the metallicity distribution
        of FGK planet hosts.}},

        installed at the 3.5 m telescope at Calar Alto Observatory. We
        employed SteParSyn, a Bayesian spectral synthesis implementation
        particularly designed to infer the stellar atmospheric
        parameters of late-type stars following a Markov chain Monte
        Carlo approach. We made use of the BT-Settl model atmospheres
        and the radiative transfer code turbospectrum to compute a grid
        of synthetic spectra around 75 magnetically insensitive Fe I and
        Ti I lines plus the TiO $\gamma$ and $\epsilon$ bands. To avoid
        any potential degeneracy in the parameter space, we imposed
        Bayesian priors on Teff and log g based on the comprehensive,
        multi-band photometric data available for the sample. We find
        that this methodology is suitable down to M7.0 V, where
        refractory metals such as Ti are expected to condense in the
        stellar photospheres. The derived $T_{\rm eff}$, $\log{g}$, and
        [Fe/H] range from 3000 to 4200 K, 4.5 to 5.3 dex, and -0.7 to
        0.2 dex, respectively. Although our $T_{\rm eff}$ scale is in
        good agreement with the literature, we report large
        discrepancies in the [Fe/H] scales, which might arise from the
        different methodologies and sets of lines considered. However,
        our [Fe/H] is in agreement with the metallicity distribution of
        FGK-type stars in the solar neighbourhood and correlates well
        with the kinematic membership of the targets in the Galactic

@article{mann_2019,
	Abstract = {{The mass-luminosity relation for late-type stars has long been a
        critical tool for estimating stellar masses. However, there is
        growing need for both a higher-precision relation and a better
        understanding of systematic effects (e.g., metallicity). Here we
        present an empirical relationship between \{M\}$_{\{K}$$_{S}$\}
        and M $_{*}$ spanning 0.075 M $_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ < M
        $_{*}$ < 0.70 M $_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$. The relation is
        derived from 62 nearby binaries, whose orbits we determine using
        a combination of Keck/NIRC2 imaging, archival adaptive optics
        data, and literature astrometry. From their orbital parameters,
        we determine the total mass of each system, with a precision
        better than 1\% in the best cases. We use these total masses, in
        combination with resolved K $_{ S }$ magnitudes and system
        parallaxes, to calibrate the \{M\}$_{\{K}$$_{S}$\}-M $_{*}$
        relation. The resulting posteriors can be used to determine
        masses of single stars with a precision of 2\%-3\%, which we
        confirm by testing the relation on stars with individual
        dynamical masses from the literature. The precision is limited
        by scatter around the best-fit relation beyond measured M $_{*}$
        uncertainties, perhaps driven by intrinsic variation in the
        \{M\}$_{\{K}$$_{S}$\}-M $_{*}$ relation or underestimated
        uncertainties in the input parallaxes. We find that the effect
        of [Fe/H] on the \{M\}$_{\{K}$$_{S}$\}-M $_{*}$ relation is
        likely negligible for metallicities in the solar neighborhood
        (0.0\% {\ensuremath{\pm}} 2.2\% change in mass per dex change in
        [Fe/H]). This weak effect is consistent with predictions from
        the Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Database, but inconsistent with
        those from MESA Isochrones and Stellar Tracks (at
        5{\ensuremath{\sigma}}). A sample of binaries with a wider range
        of abundances will be required to discern the importance of
        metallicity in extreme populations (e.g., in the Galactic halo
        or thick disk).}},

	Abstract = {{We use the optical and near-infrared photometry from the Kepler Input
        Catalog to provide improved estimates of the stellar
        characteristics of the smallest stars in the Kepler target list.
        We find 3897 dwarfs with temperatures below 4000 K, including 64
        planet candidate host stars orbited by 95 transiting planet
        candidates. We refit the transit events in the Kepler light
        curves for these planet candidates and combine the revised
        planet/star radius ratios with our improved stellar radii to
        revise the radii of the planet candidates orbiting the cool
        target stars. We then compare the number of observed planet
        candidates to the number of stars around which such planets
        could have been detected in order to estimate the planet
        occurrence rate around cool stars. We find that the occurrence
        rate of 0.5-4 R $_{{\ensuremath{\oplus}}}$ planets with orbital
        periods shorter than 50 days is 0.90\^\{+0.04\}\_\{-0.03\}
        planets per star. The occurrence rate of Earth-size (0.5-1.4 R
        $_{{\ensuremath{\oplus}}}$) planets is constant across the
        temperature range of our sample at 0.51\_\{-0.05\}\^\{+0.06\}
        Earth-size planets per star, but the occurrence of 1.4-4 R
        $_{{\ensuremath{\oplus}}}$ planets decreases significantly at
        cooler temperatures. Our sample includes two Earth-size planet
        candidates in the habitable zone, allowing us to estimate that
        the mean number of Earth-size planets in the habitable zone is
        0.15\^\{+0.13\}\_\{-0.06\} planets per cool star. Our 95\%
        confidence lower limit on the occurrence rate of Earth-size
        planets in the habitable zones of cool stars is 0.04 planets per
        star. With 95\% confidence, the nearest transiting Earth-size
        planet in the habitable zone of a cool star is within 21 pc.
        Moreover, the nearest non-transiting planet in the habitable
        zone is within 5 pc with 95\% confidence.}},

	Abstract = {{The meter-per-second precision achieved by today's velocimeters enables
        us to search for 1-10 M$_{{\ensuremath{\oplus}}}$ planets in the
        habitable zone of cool stars. This paper reports on the
        detection of three planets orbiting <ASTROBJ>GJ 163</ASTROBJ>
        (HIP 19394), a M3 dwarf monitored by our ESO/HARPS search for
        planets. We made use of the HARPS spectrograph to collect 150
        radial velocities of GJ 163 over a period of eight years. We
        searched the radial-velocity time series for coherent signals
        and found five distinct periodic variabilities. We investigated
        the stellar activity and called into question the planetary
        interpretation for two signals. Before more data can be acquired
        we concluded that at least three planets are orbiting GJ 163.
        They have orbital periods of P$_{b}$ = 8.632 {\ensuremath{\pm}}
        0.002, P$_{c}$ = 25.63 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.03, and P$_{d}$ =
        604 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 8 days and minimum masses msini = 10.6
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.6, 6.8 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.9, and 29
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 3 M$_{{\ensuremath{\oplus}}}$, respectively.
        We hold our interpretations for the two additional signals with
        periods P$_{(e)}$ = 19.4 and P$_{(f)}$ = 108 days. The inner
        pair presents an orbital period ratio of 2.97, but a dynamical
        analysis of the system shows that it lays outside the 3:1 mean
        motion resonance. The planet GJ 163c, in particular, is a super-
        Earth with an equilibrium temperature of T$_{eq}$ = (302
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 10)(1 - A)$^{1/4}$ K and may lie in the so-
        called habitable zone for albedo values (A = 0.34 - 0.89)
        moderately higher than that of Earth
        (A$_{{\ensuremath{\oplus}}}$ = 0.2-0.3).

	Abstract = {{\textbackslash Aims: We report on observations of the active K2 dwarf ɛ
        Eridani based on contemporaneous SPIRou, NARVAL and TESS data
        obtained over two months in late 2018, when the activity of the
        star was reported to be in a non-cyclic phase. \textbackslash
        Methods: Near-infrared (NIR) spectropolarimetry was obtained
        using SPIRou over four nights in late September, while visible
        spectropolarimetry was collected with NARVAL over 20 nights,
        spread between 18 September and 07 November. We first recovered
        the fundamental parameters of the target from both visible and
        NIR spectral fitting. The large-scale magnetic field was
        investigated from polarimetric data. From unpolarized spectra,
        we estimated the total magnetic flux through Zeeman broadening
        of magnetically sensitive NIR lines and the chromospheric
        emission using the CaII H\&K lines. The photometric monitoring,
        secured with TESS between 19 October and 15 November, is
        modelled with pseudo-periodic Gaussian process regression.
        \textbackslash Results: Fundamental parameters of ɛ Eridani
        derived from visible and NIR wavelengths provide us with
        consistent results, which also agree with published values. We
        report a progressive increase of macroturbulence towards larger
        NIR wavelengths. Zeeman broadening of individual lines
        highlights an unsigned surface magnetic field B$_{mono}$ = 1.90
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.13 kG, with a filling factor f = 12.5
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 1.7\% (unsigned magnetic flux Bf = 237
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 36 G). The large-scale magnetic field
        geometry, chromospheric emission and broadband photometry
        display clear signs of non-rotational evolution over the course
        of data collection. Characteristic decay times deduced from the
        light curve and longitudinal field fall in the range 30-40 days,
        while the characteristic timescale of surface differential
        rotation, as derived through the evolution of the magnetic
        geometry, is equal to 57 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 5 days. The large-
        scale magnetic field exhibits a combination of properties not
        observed previously for ɛ Eridani, with a surface field among
        the weakest previously reported, but this field is also mostly
        axisymmetric, and is dominated by a toroidal component.}},

	Abstract = {{Present and future high-precision radial-velocity spectrometers
        dedicated to the discovery of low-mass planets orbiting low-mass
        dwarfs need to focus on the best selected stars to make an
        efficient use of telescope time. In the framework of the
        preparation of the SPIRou Input Catalogue (SPIC), the CoolSnap
        program aims at screening M dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood
        against binarity, rapid rotation, activity, etc. To optimize the
        selection, this paper describes the methods used to compute
        effective temperature, metallicity, projected rotation velocity
        of a large sample of 440 M dwarfs observed in the visible with
        the high-resolution spectropolarimeter Echelle
        SpectroPolArimetric Device for the ObservatioN of Stars
        (ESPaDOnS) at Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. It also summarizes
        known and newly discovered spectroscopic binaries, and stars
        known to belong to visual multiple systems. A calibration of the
        projected rotation velocity versus measured line widths for M
        dwarfs observed by the ESPaDOnS spectropolarimeter is derived,
        and the resulting values are compared to equatorial rotation
        velocities deduced from rotation periods and radii. A comparison
        of the derived effective temperatures and metallicities with
        literature values is also conducted. Finally, the radial-
        velocity uncertainty of each star in the sample is estimated, to
        narrow down the selection of stars to be included into the SPIC.}},

	Abstract = {{We classified the reddest (r - J > 2.2) stars observed by the NASA
        Kepler mission into main-sequence dwarf or evolved giant stars
        and determined the properties of 4216 M dwarfs based on a
        comparison of available photometry with that of nearby
        calibrator stars, as well as available proper motions and
        spectra. We revised the properties of candidate transiting
        planets using the stellar parameters, high-resolution imaging to
        identify companion stars, and, in the case of binaries, fitting
        light curves to identify the likely planet host. In 49 of 54
        systems, we validated the primary as the host star. We inferred
        the intrinsic distribution of M dwarf planets using the method
        of iterative Monte Carlo simulation. We compared several models
        of planet orbital geometry and clustering and found that one
        where planets are exponentially distributed and almost precisely
        coplanar best describes the distribution of multiplanet systems.
        We determined that Kepler M dwarfs host an average of 2.2
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.3 planets with radii of 1-4
        R$_{{\ensuremath{\oplus}}}$ and orbital periods of 1.5-180 d.
        The radius distribution peaks at {\ensuremath{\sim}}1.2

        R$_{{\ensuremath{\oplus}}}$, although we identify three giant
        planet candidates other than the previously confirmed
        Kepler-45b. There is suggestive but not significant evidence
        that the radius distribution varies with orbital period. The
        distribution with logarithmic orbital period is flat except for
        a decline for orbits less than a few days. 12 candidate planets,

        born with a convective core has so far been based on homogeneous
        analyses of space photometric Kepler light curves of 4 years
        duration, to which most often incomplete inhomogeneously deduced
        spectroscopic information was added to break degeneracies. We
        composed a sample of 111 dwarf gravity-mode pulsators observed
        by the Kepler space telescope whose light curves allowed for
        determination of their near-core rotation rates. For this sample
        we assembled HERMES high-resolution optical spectroscopy at the
        1.2-m Mercator telescope. Our spectroscopic information offers
        additional observational input to also model the envelope layers
        of these non-radially pulsating dwarfs. We determined stellar
        parameters and surface abundances in a homogeneous way from
        atmospheric analysis with spectrum normalisation based on a new
        machine learning tool. Our results suggest a systematic
        overestimation of [M/H] in the literature for the studied F-type
        dwarfs, presumably due to normalisation limitations caused by
        the dense line spectrum of these rotating stars. CNO-surface
        abundances were found to be uncorrelated with the rotation
        properties of the F-type stars. For the B-type stars, we find a
        hint of deep mixing from C and O abundance ratios; N abundances
        have too large uncertainties to reveal a correlation with the
        rotation of the stars. Our spectroscopic stellar parameters and
        abundance determinations allow for future joint spectroscopic,
        astrometric (Gaia), and asteroseismic modelling of this legacy

	Abstract = {{We present The Payne, a general method for the precise and simultaneous
        determination of numerous stellar labels from observed spectra,
        based on fitting physical spectral models. The Payne combines a
        number of important methodological aspects: it exploits the
        information from much of the available spectral range; it fits
        all labels (stellar parameters and elemental abundances)
        simultaneously; it uses spectral models, where the structure of
        the atmosphere and the radiative transport are consistently
        calculated to reflect the stellar labels. At its core The Payne
        has an approach to accurate and precise interpolation and
        prediction of the spectrum in high-dimensional label space that
        is flexible and robust, yet based on only a moderate number of
        ab initio models (\{ \textbackslashmathcal O \}(1000) for 25
        labels). With a simple neural-net-like functional form and a
        suitable choice of training labels, this interpolation yields a
        spectral flux prediction good to 10$^{-3}$ rms across a wide
        range of T $_{eff}$ and \{log\}g (including dwarfs and giants).
        We illustrate the power of this approach by applying it to the
        APOGEE DR14 data set, drawing on Kurucz models with recently
        improved line lists: without recalibration, we obtain physically
        sensible stellar parameters as well as 15 elemental abundances
        that appear to be more precise than the published APOGEE DR14
        values. In short, The Payne is an approach that for the first
        time combines all these key ingredients, necessary for progress
        toward optimal modeling of survey spectra; and it leads to both
        precise and accurate estimates of stellar labels, based on
        physical models and without
        {\textquotedblleft}recalibration.{\textquotedblright} Both the
        codes and catalog are made publicly available online.}},

@article{donati_1997b,
	Abstract = {{This paper reports the results of five years (five runs, 23 nights) of
        spectropolarimetric observations of active stars with the UCL
        Echelle Spectrograph of the Anglo-Australian Telescope. 225
        circularly (and four linearly) polarized spectra were recorded
        on 28 objects (21 active stars and seven calibration standards)
        using the new technique of Zeeman-Doppler imaging. To extract
        polarization echelle spectra from raw frames, we developed a new
        dedicated automatic software package (called ESprit, which
        utilizes optimal extraction techniques) whose detailed
        description is given in the paper. For each recorded spectrum,
        we extract `mean' polarized and unpolarized profiles using
        `least-squares deconvolution', a technique similar to cross-
        correlation, which can enhance enormously the sensitivity of
        Zeeman-Doppler imaging, by up to 7.5 mag in flux with respect to
        a single average line analysis or by 4.5 mag compared with the
        older technique of Donati et al. in the particular case of a K1
        star. Magnetic field is detected unambiguously on 14 objects,
        namely the weak-line T Tauri star V410 Tau, the pre-main-
        sequence binary HD 155555, the ZAMS stars AB Dor and LQ Hya, the
        dwarf flare star CC Eri, the RS CVn systems HR 1099, EI Eri, TY
        Pyx, CF Tuc, SZ Psc, II Peg, IM Peg and IL Hya, and the FK Com
        star YY Men. Marginal field detections are also obtained for the
        weak-line T Tauri star HD 283572 and the Herbig Ae star HD
        104237. Except on HR 1099 and II Peg, our results represent the
        first direct field detections ever reported on these objects,
        and in particular the first direct field detection on as young a
        star as V410 Tau. Most of the magnetic signatures we detect on
        cool stars show several sign reversals throughout the line
        profile, indicating that the parent field structure is rather
        complex and must feature (as expected) many small-scale magnetic
        regions of different polarities. For all stars on which Zeeman
        detections are recorded with sufficient accuracy (namely LQ Hya,
        CC Eri, HR 1099, EI Eri, II Peg, IL Hya and YY Men),
        differential least-squares deconvolution from both the blue and
        the red parts of the spectral domain indicates that the magnetic
        regions we detect are mostly 500 to 1000 K cooler than, and
        sometimes at the same temperature as, but never warmer than the
        surrounding photosphere. Serendipitous results include the first
        detection (i) of small-amplitude radial velocity variations
        (1.3kms\^-1 peak to peak) of the Herbig Ae star HD 104237 with
        small enough a period (37.5+/-1 min) that they must be due to
        stellar pulsations and (ii) of the solar-like secondary
        component of the RS CVn system IL Hya.}},

        infrared spectropolarimeter/precision velocimeter recently
        installed on the 3.6-m Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT).
        Starting from the two main science goals, i.e., the quest for
        planetary systems around nearby M dwarfs and the study of
        magnetized star/planet formation, we outline the instrument
        concept that was designed to efficiently address these forefront
        topics, and detail the in-lab and on-sky instrument performances
        measured throughout the intensive testing phase that SPIRou was
        submitted to before passing the final acceptance review in early
        2019 and initiating science observations. With a central
        position among the newly started programmes, the SPIRou Legacy
        Survey (SLS) Large Programme was allocated 300 CFHT nights until
        at least mid 2022. We also briefly describe a few of the first
        results obtained in the various science topics that SPIRou
        started investigating, focusing in particular on planetary
        systems of nearby M dwarfs, transiting exoplanets and their
        atmospheres, magnetic fields of young stars, but also on
        alternate science goals like the atmospheres of M dwarfs and the
        Earth's atmosphere. We finally conclude on the key role that
        SPIRou and the CFHT can play in coordination with forthcoming
        major facilities like the JWST, the ELTs, PLATO, and ARIEL over
        the decade.}},

	Abstract = {{The scientific community's interest on the stellar parameters of M
        dwarfs has been increasing over the last few years, with
        potential applications ranging from galactic characterization to
        exoplanet detection. The main motivation for this work is to
        develop an alternative and objective method to derive stellar
        parameters for M dwarfs using the H-band spectra provided by the
        Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE).
        Synthetic spectra generated with \textbackslashtextit\{iSpec\},
        \textbackslashtextit\{Turbospectrum\},
        \textbackslashtextit\{MARCS\} models atmospheres and a custom
        made line list including over 1 000 000 water lines, are
        compared to APOGEE observations, and parameters are determined
        through $\chi^2$ minimization. Spectroscopic parameters
        ($T_\mathrm{eff}$, $[M/H]$, $\log g$, $v_{mic}$) are presented
        for a sample of 313 M dwarfs, obtained from their APOGEE H-band
        spectra. The generated synthetic spectra reproduce observed
        spectra to a high accuracy level. The impact of the spectra
        normalization on the results are analyzed as well. Our output
        parameters are compared with the ones obtained with APOGEE
        Stellar Parameter and Chemical Abundances Pipeline (ASPCAP) for
        the same stellar spectrum, and we find that the values agree
        within the expected uncertainties. Comparisons with other
        previous near-infrared and optical literature are also
        available, with median differences within our estimated
        uncertainties found in most cases. Possible reasons for these
        differences are explored. The full H-band line list, the line
        selection for the synthesis, and the synthesized spectra are
        available for download, as are the calculated stellar
        parameters.}},

	Abstract = {{We present interferometric angular diameter measurements of 21 low-mass,
        K- and M-dwarfs made with the CHARA Array. This sample is
        enhanced by adding a collection of radius measurements published
        in the literature to form a total data set of 33 K-M-dwarfs with
        diameters measured to better than 5\%. We use these data in
        combination with the Hipparcos parallax and new measurements of
        the star's bolometric flux to compute absolute luminosities,
        linear radii, and effective temperatures for the stars. We
        develop empirical relations for
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitildeK0 to M4 main-sequence stars
        that link the stellar temperature, radius, and luminosity to the
        observed (B - V), (V - R), (V - I), (V - J), (V - H), and (V -
        K) broadband color index and stellar metallicity [Fe/H]. These
        relations are valid for metallicities ranging from [Fe/H] = -0.5
        to +0.1 dex and are accurate to
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde2\%,
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde5\%, and
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde4\% for temperature, radius, and
        luminosity, respectively. Our results show that it is necessary
        to use metallicity-dependent transformations in order to
        properly convert colors into stellar temperatures, radii, and
        luminosities. Alternatively, we find no sensitivity to
        metallicity on relations we construct to the global properties
        of a star omitting color information, e.g., temperature-radius
        and temperature-luminosity. Thus, we are able to empirically
        quantify to what order the star's observed color index is
        impacted by the stellar iron abundance. In addition to the
        empirical relations, we also provide a representative look-up
        table via stellar spectral classifications using this collection
        of data. Robust examinations of single star temperatures and
        radii compared to evolutionary model predictions on the
        luminosity-temperature and luminosity-radius planes reveal that
        models overestimate the temperatures of stars with surface
        temperatures $\lt$5000 K by \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde3\%,
        and underestimate the radii of stars with radii $\lt$0.7 R
        $_{☉}$ by \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde5\%. These conclusions
        additionally suggest that the models over account for the
        effects that the stellar metallicity may have on the
        astrophysical properties of an object. By comparing the
        interferometrically measured radii for the single star
        population to those of eclipsing binaries, we find that for a
        given mass, single and binary star radii are indistinguishable.
        However, we also find that for a given radius, the literature
        temperatures for binary stars are systematically lower compared
        to our interferometrically derived temperatures of single stars
        by \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde200 to 300 K. The nature of
        this offset is dependent on the validation of binary star
        temperatures, where bringing all measurements to a uniform and
        correctly calibrated temperature scale is needed to identify any
        influence stellar activity may have on the physical properties
        of a star. Lastly, we present an empirically determined H-R
        diagram using fundamental properties presented here in
        combination with those in Boyajian et al. for a total of 74
        nearby, main-sequence, A- to M-type stars, and define regions of
        habitability for the potential existence of sub-stellar mass
        companions in each system.}},

        increasingly significant discrepancy in the V band for
        decreasing masses. The theoretical mass-luminosity relation

        errors in the local stellar mass functions derived from V band
        luminosity functions. Based on observations made at the

        evolutionary tracks in Padova. It is the result of a thorough
        revision of the major input physics, together with the inclusion
        of the pre-main sequence phase, not present in our previous
        releases of stellar models. Another innovative aspect is the
        possibility of promptly generating accurate opacity tables fully
        consistent with any selected initial chemical composition, by
        coupling the Opacity Project At Livermore (OPAL) data at high
        temperatures to the molecular opacities computed with our
        {\ae}SOPUS code. In this work, we present extended sets of
        stellar evolutionary models for various initial chemical
        compositions, while other sets with different metallicities
        and/or different distributions of heavy elements are being
        computed. For the present release of models, we adopt the solar
        distribution of heavy elements from the recent revision by
        Caffau et al., corresponding to a Sun's metallicity Z ≃ 0.0152.
        From all computed sets of stellar tracks, we also derive
        isochrones in several photometric systems. The aim is to provide
        the community with the basic tools to model star clusters and
        galaxies by means of population synthesis techniques.}},

	Abstract = {{The Rossiter-McLaughlin effect observed for transiting exoplanets often
        requires prior knowledge of the stellar projected equatorial
        rotational velocity (v sin i). This is usually provided by
        measuring the broadening of spectral lines, however this method
        has uncertainties as lines are also broadened by velocity fields
        in the stellar photosphere known as macroturbulence (v$_{mac}$).
        We have estimated accurate v sin i values from asteroseismic
        analyses of main-sequence stars observed by Kepler. The
        rotational frequency splittings of the detected solar-like
        oscillations of these stars are determined largely by the near-
        surface rotation. These estimates have been used to infer the
        v$_{mac}$ values for 28 Kepler stars. Out of this sample, 26
        stars were used along with the Sun to obtain a new calibration
        between v$_{mac}$, effective temperature and surface gravity.
        The new calibration is valid for the temperature range 5200 to
        6400 K and the gravity range 4.0 to 4.6 dex. A comparison is
        also provided with previous v$_{mac}$ calibrations. As a result

@article{maldonado_2015,
	Abstract = {{Context. Low-mass stars have been recognised as promising targets in the
        search for rocky, small planets with the potential of supporting
        life. As a consequence, Doppler search programmes using high-
        resolution spectrographs like HARPS or HARPS-N are providing
        huge quantities of optical spectra of M dwarfs. However,
        determining the stellar parameters of M dwarfs using optical
        spectra has proven to be challenging. \textbackslash Aims: We
        aim to calibrate empirical relationships to determine accurate
        stellar parameters for early-M dwarfs (spectral types M0-M4.5)
        using the same spectra as those that are used for radial
        velocity determinations, without the necessity of acquiring IR
        spectra or relying on atmospheric models and/or photometric
        calibrations. \textbackslash Methods: Our methodology consists
        of using ratios of pseudo-equivalent widths of spectral features
        as a temperature diagnostic, a technique frequently used in
        solar-type stars. Stars with effective temperatures obtained
        from interferometric estimates of their radii are used as
        calibrators. Empirical calibrations for the spectral type are
        also provided. Combinations of features and ratios of features
        are used to derive calibrations for the stellar metallicity. Our
        methods are then applied to a large sample of M dwarfs that are
        currently being observed in the framework of the HARPS GTO
        search for extrasolar planets. The derived temperatures and
        metallicities are used together with photometric estimates of
        mass, radius, and surface gravity to calibrate empirical
        relationships for these parameters. \textbackslash Results: A
        long list of spectral features in the optical spectra of early-M
        dwarfs was identified. This list shows that the pseudo-
        equivalent width of roughly 43\% of the features is strongly
        anticorrelated with the effective temperature. The correlation
        with the stellar metallicity is weaker. A total of 112
        temperature sensitive ratios were identified and calibrated over
        the range 3100-3950 K, providing effective temperatures with
        typical uncertainties of about 70 K. Eighty-two ratios of
        pseudo-equivalent widths of features were calibrated to derive
        spectral types within 0.5 subtypes for stars with spectral types
        between K7V and M4.5V. We calibrated 696 combinations of the
        pseudo-equivalent widths of individual features and temperature-
        sensitive ratios for the stellar metallicity over a metallicity
        range from -0.54 to +0.24 dex, with estimated uncertainties in
        the range of 0.07-0.10 dex. We provide our own empirical
        calibrations for stellar mass, radius, and surface gravity.
        These parameters depend on the stellar metallicity. For a given
        effective temperature, lower metallicities predict lower masses
        and radii as well as higher gravities.

	Abstract = {{M dwarfs are prominent targets of planet search projects, and their
        chemical composition is crucial to understanding the formation
        process or interior of orbiting exoplanets. However,
        measurements of elemental abundances of M dwarfs have been
        limited due to difficulties in the analysis of their optical
        spectra. We conducted a detailed chemical analysis of five M
        dwarfs (T$_{eff}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} 3200-3800 K), which form
        binary systems with G/K-type stars, by performing a line-by-line
        analysis based on high-resolution (R {\ensuremath{\sim}} 80000)
        near-infrared (960-1710 nm) spectra obtained with CARMENES
        (Calar Alto high-Resolution search for M dwarfs with Exo-earths
        with Near-infrared and optical {\'E}chelle Spectrographs). We
        determined the chemical abundances of eight elements (Na, Mg, K,
        Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, and Fe), which are in agreement with those of
        the primary stars within measurement errors
        ({\ensuremath{\sim}}0.2 dex). Through the analysis process, we
        investigated the unique behavior of atomic lines in a cool
        atmosphere. Most atomic lines are sensitive to changes in the
        abundance of not only the corresponding elements but also other
        elements, especially dominant electron donors such as Na and Ca.
        The Ti I lines show a negative correlation with the overall
        metallicity at T$_{eff}$ $\lt$ 3400 K due to the consumption of
        neutral titanium by the formation of TiO molecules. These
        findings indicate that to estimate the overall metallicity or
        the abundance of any element correctly, we need to determine the
        abundances of other individual elements consistently.}},

	Abstract = {{M-dwarf stars are the most numerous stars in the Universe; they span a
        wide range in mass and are in the focus of ongoing and planned
        exoplanet surveys. To investigate and understand their physical
        nature, detailed spectral information and accurate stellar
        models are needed. We use a new synthetic atmosphere model
        generation and compare model spectra to observations. To test
        the model accuracy, we compared the models to four benchmark
        stars with atmospheric parameters for which independent
        information from interferometric radius measurements is
        available. We used {\ensuremath{\chi}}$^{2}$-based methods to
        determine parameters from high-resolution spectroscopic
        observations. Our synthetic spectra are based on the new PHOENIX
        grid that uses the ACES description for the equation of state.
        This is a model generation expected to be especially suitable
        for the low-temperature atmospheres. We identified suitable
        spectral tracers of atmospheric parameters and determined the
        uncertainties in T$_{eff}$, log g, and [Fe/H] resulting from
        degeneracies between parameters and from shortcomings of the
        model atmospheres. The inherent uncertainties we find are
        {\ensuremath{\sigma}}$_{T<SUB>eff}$</SUB> = 35 K,
        {\ensuremath{\sigma}}$_{log g}$ = 0.14, and
        {\ensuremath{\sigma}}$_{[Fe/H]}$ = 0.11. The new model spectra
        achieve a reliable match to our observed data; our results for
        T$_{eff}$ and log g are consistent with literature values to
        within 1{\ensuremath{\sigma}}. However, metallicities reported
        from earlier photometric and spectroscopic calibrations in some
        cases disagree with our results by more than
        3{\ensuremath{\sigma}}. A possible explanation are systematic
        errors in earlier metallicity determinations that were based on
        insufficient descriptions of the cool atmospheres. At this
        point, however, we cannot definitely identify the reason for
        this discrepancy, but our analysis indicates that there is a
        large uncertainty in the accuracy of M-dwarf parameter
        estimates. \textbackslash\textbackslashBased on observations

	Abstract = {{High-resolution, near-infrared spectra will be the primary tool for
        finding and characterizing Earth-like planets around low-mass
        stars. Yet, the properties of exoplanets cannot be precisely
        determined without accurate and precise measurements of the host
        star. Spectra obtained with the Immersion Grating Infrared
        Spectrometer simultaneously provide diagnostics for most stellar
        parameters, but the first step in any analysis is the
        determination of the effective temperature. Here we report the
        calibration of high-resolution H-band spectra to accurately
        determine the effective temperature for stars between 4000 and
        3000 K ({\ensuremath{\sim}}K8-M5) using absorption line-depths
        of Fe I, OH, and Al I. The field star sample used here contains
        254 K and M stars with temperatures derived using BT-Settl
        synthetic spectra. We use 106 stars with precise temperatures in
        the literature to calibrate our method, with typical errors of
        about 140 K, and systematic uncertainties less than
        {\ensuremath{\sim}}120 K. For the broadest applicability, we
        present T $_{eff}$-line-depth-ratio relationships, which we test
        on 12 members of the TW Hydrae Association and at spectral
        resolving powers between {\ensuremath{\sim}}10,000 and 120,000.
        These ratios offer a simple but accurate measure of effective
        temperatures in cool stars that are distance and reddening
        independent.}},

        molecular spectroscopic compilation. The new edition replaces
        the previous HITRAN edition of 2008 and its updates during the
        intervening years. The HITRAN molecular absorption compilation
        is comprised of six major components structured into folders
        that are freely accessible on the internet. These folders
        consist of the traditional line-by-line spectroscopic parameters
        required for high-resolution radiative-transfer codes, infrared
        absorption cross-sections for molecules not yet amenable to
        representation in a line-by-line form, ultraviolet spectroscopic
        parameters, aerosol indices of refraction, collision-induced
        absorption data, and general tables such as partition sums that
        apply globally to the data. The new HITRAN is greatly extended
        in terms of accuracy, spectral coverage, additional absorption
        phenomena, and validity. Molecules and isotopologues have been
        added that address the issues of atmospheres beyond the Earth.
        Also discussed is a new initiative that casts HITRAN into a
        relational database format that offers many advantages over the
        long-standing sequential text-based structure that has existed
        since the initial release of HITRAN in the early 1970s.

@article{clough_1995,
	Abstract = {{A line-by-line model (LBLRTM) has been applied to the calculation of
        clear-sky longwave fluxes and cooling rates for atmospheres
        including CO$_{2}$, O$_{3}$, CH$_{4}$, N$_{2}$O, CCl$_{4}$,
        CFC-11, CFC-12, and CFC-22 in addition to water vapor. The
        present paper continues the approach developed in an earlier
        article in which the radiative properties of atmospheres with
        water vapor alone were reported. Tropospheric water vapor
        continues to be of principal importance for the longwave region
        due to the spectral extent of its absorbing properties, while
        the absorption bands of other trace species have influence over
        limited spectral domains. The principal effects of adding carbon
        dioxide are to reduce the role of the water vapor in the lower
        troposphere and to provide 72\% of the 13.0 K d$^{-1}$ cooling
        rate at the stratopause. In general, the introduction of
        uniformly mixed trace species into atmospheres with significant
        amounts of water vapor has the effect of reducing the cooling
        associated with water vapor, providing an apparent net
        atmospheric heating. The radiative consequences of doubling
        carbon dioxide from the present level are consistent with these
        results. For the midlatitude summer atmosphere the heating
        associated with ozone that occurs from 500 to 20 mbar reaches a
        maximum of 0.25 K d$^{-1}$ at 50 mbar and partially offsets the
        cooling of 1.0 K d$^{-1}$ contributed by H$_{2}$O and CO$_{2}$
        at this level. In the stratosphere the 704 cm$^{-1}$ band of
        ozone, not included in many radiation models, contributes 25\%
        of the ozone cooling rate. Radiative effects associated with
        anticipated 10-year constituent profile changes, 1990-2000, are
        presented from both a spectral and spectrally integrated
        perspective. The effect of the trace gases has been studied for
        three atmospheres: tropical, midlatitude summer, and midlatitude
        winter. Using these results and making a reasonable
        approximation for the polar regions, we obtain a value for the
        longwave flux at the top of the atmosphere of 265.5 W m$^{-2}$,
        in close agreement with the clear-sky Earth Radiation Budget
        Experiment (ERBE) observations. This agreement provides strong
        support for the present approach as a reference method for the
        study of radiative effects resulting from changes in the
        distributions of trace species on global radiative forcing. Many
        of the results from the spectral calculations reported here are
        archived at the Carbon Dioxide Information and Analysis Center
        for use by the community. \textbackslash\textbackslash}},

	Abstract = {We investigate various astrophysical contributions to the statistical uncertainty of precision radial velocity measurements of stellar spectra. We first analytically determine the intrinsic uncertainty in centroiding isolated spectral lines broadened by Gaussian, Lorentzian, Voigt, and rotational profiles, finding that for all cases and assuming weak lines, the uncertainty in the line centroid is , where Θ is the full-width at half-maximum of the line, W is the equivalent width, and I0 is the continuum signal-to-noise ratio, with C a constant of order unity that depends on the specific line profile. We use this result to motivate approximate analytic expressions to the total radial velocity uncertainty for a stellar spectrum with a given photon noise, resolution, wavelength, effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, macroturbulence, and stellar rotation. We use these relations to determine the dominant contributions to the statistical uncertainties in precision radial velocity measurements as a function of effective temperature and mass for main-sequence stars. For stars more massive than ∼1.1 M⊙ we find that stellar rotation dominates the velocity uncertainties for moderate and high-resolution spectra (R ≳ 30,000). For less-massive stars, a variety of sources contribute depending on the spectral resolution and wavelength, with photon noise due to decreasing bolometric luminosity generally becoming increasingly important for low-mass stars at fixed exposure time and distance. In most cases, resolutions greater than 60,000 provide little benefit in terms of statistical precision, although higher resolutions would likely allow for better control of systematic uncertainties. We find that the spectra of cooler stars and stars with higher metallicity are intrinsically richer in velocity information, as expected. We determine the optimal wavelength range for stars of various spectral types, finding that the optimal region depends on the stellar effective temperature, but for mid M-dwarfs and earlier the most efficient wavelength region is from 6000 to 9000 {\AA}.},

	Abstract = {{We combine results from interferometry, asteroseismology and
        spectroscopy to determine accurate fundamental parameters of 23
        bright solar-type stars, from spectral type F5 to K2 and
        luminosity classes III-V. For some stars we can use direct
        techniques to determine the mass, radius, luminosity and
        effective temperature, and we compare with indirect methods that
        rely on photometric calibrations or spectroscopic analyses. We
        use the asteroseismic information available in the literature to
        infer an indirect mass with an accuracy of 4-15 per cent. From
        indirect methods we determine luminosity and radius to 3 per
        cent. We find evidence that the luminosity from the indirect
        method is slightly overestimated ({\ensuremath{\approx}} 5 per
        cent) for the coolest stars, indicating that their bolometric
        corrections (BCs) are too negative. For T$_{eff}$ we find a
        slight offset of -40 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 20 K between the
        spectroscopic method and the direct method, meaning the
        spectroscopic temperatures are too high. From the spectroscopic
        analysis we determine the detailed chemical composition for 13
        elements, including Li, C and O. The metallicity ranges from
        [Fe/H]=-1.7 to +0.4, and there is clear evidence for
        {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-element enhancement in the metal-poor
        stars. We find no significant offset between the spectroscopic
        surface gravity and the value from combining asteroseismology
        with radius estimates. From the spectroscopy we also determine v
        sin i and we present a new calibration of macroturbulence and
        microturbulence. From the comparison between the results from
        the direct and spectroscopic methods we claim that we can
        determine T$_{eff}$, log g and [Fe/H] with absolute accuracies
        of 80 K, 0.08 and 0.07 dex. Photometric calibrations of
        Str{\"o}mgren indices provide accurate results for T$_{eff}$ and
        [Fe/H] but will be more uncertain for distant stars when
        interstellar reddening becomes important. The indirect methods
        are important to obtain reliable estimates of the fundamental
        parameters of relatively faint stars when interferometry cannot
        be used. This paper is the first to compare direct and indirect
        methods for a large sample of stars, and we conclude that
        indirect methods are valid, although slight corrections may be
        needed.}},

        Correcting for these lines, mostly affecting the red and
        infrared region of the spectrum, usually relies on observations
        of specific stars obtained close in time and airmass to the
        science targets, therefore using precious observing time.

        Earth's atmospheric transmission. Molecfit is versatile and can
        be used with data obtained with various ground-based telescopes
        and instruments. \textbackslash Methods: Molecfit combines a
        publicly available radiative transfer code, a molecular line
        database, atmospheric profiles, and various kernels to model the
        instrument line spread function. The atmospheric profiles are
        created by merging a standard atmospheric profile representative
        of a given observatory's climate, of local meteorological data,
        and of dynamically retrieved altitude profiles for temperature,
        pressure, and humidity. We discuss the various ingredients of
        the method, its applicability, and its limitations. We also show
        examples of telluric line correction on spectra obtained with a
        suite of ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT) instruments.
        \textbackslash Results: Compared to previous similar tools,
        molecfit takes the best results for temperature, pressure, and
        humidity in the atmosphere above the observatory into account.
        As a result, the standard deviation of the residuals after
        correction of unsaturated telluric lines is frequently better
        than 2\% of the continuum. \textbackslash Conclusions: Molecfit
        is able to accurately model and correct for telluric lines over
        a broad range of wavelengths and spectral resolutions. The
        accuracy reached is comparable to or better than the typical
        accuracy achieved using a telluric standard star observation.
        The availability of such a general tool for telluric absorption
        correction may improve future observational and analysing
        strategies, as well as empower users of archival data.

	Abstract = {{Given a matrix of observed data, Principal Components Analysis (PCA)
        computes a small number of orthogonal directions that contain
        most of its variability. Provably accurate solutions for PCA
        have been in use for a long time. However, to the best of our
        knowledge, all existing theoretical guarantees for it assume
        that the data and the corrupting noise are mutually independent,
        or at least uncorrelated. This is valid in practice often, but
        not always. In this paper, we study the PCA problem in the
        setting where the data and noise can be correlated. Such noise
        is often also referred to as ``data-dependent noise''. We obtain
        a correctness result for the standard eigenvalue decomposition
        (EVD) based solution to PCA under simple assumptions on the
        data-noise correlation. We also develop and analyze a
        generalization of EVD, cluster-EVD, that improves upon EVD in
        certain regimes. \textbackslash\textbackslash}},

	Abstract = {{The CARMENES radial velocity (RV) survey is observing 324 M dwarfs to
        search for any orbiting planets. In this paper, we present the
        survey sample by publishing one CARMENES spectrum for each M
        dwarf. These spectra cover the wavelength range 520-1710 nm at a
        resolution of at least R $\gt$80 000, and we measure its RV,
        H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emission, and projected rotation
        velocity. We present an atlas of high-resolution M-dwarf spectra
        and compare the spectra to atmospheric models. To quantify the
        RV precision that can be achieved in low-mass stars over the
        CARMENES wavelength range, we analyze our empirical information
        on the RV precision from more than 6500 observations. We compare
        our high-resolution M-dwarf spectra to atmospheric models where
        we determine the spectroscopic RV information content, Q, and
        signal-to-noise ratio. We find that for all M-type dwarfs, the
        highest RV precision can be reached in the wavelength range
        700-900 nm. Observations at longer wavelengths are equally
        precise only at the very latest spectral types (M8 and M9). We
        demonstrate that in this spectroscopic range, the large amount
        of absorption features compensates for the intrinsic faintness
        of an M7 star. To reach an RV precision of 1 m s$^{-1}$ in very
        low mass M dwarfs at longer wavelengths likely requires the use
        of a 10 m class telescope. For spectral types M6 and earlier,
        the combination of a red visual and a near-infrared spectrograph
        is ideal to search for low-mass planets and to distinguish
        between planets and stellar variability. At a 4 m class
        telescope, an instrument like CARMENES has the potential to push
        the RV precision well below the typical jitter level of 3-4 m
        s$^{-1}$.}},

        the aim of detecting Earth-mass planets orbiting in the
        habitable zones of their host stars. To ensure an optimal use of
        the CARMENES guaranteed time observations, in this paper we
        investigate the correlation of activity and rotation for
        approximately 2200 M dwarfs, ranging in spectral type from M0.0
        V to M9.0 V. We present new high-resolution spectroscopic
        observations with FEROS, CAFE, and HRS of approximately 500 M
        dwarfs. For each new observation, we determined its radial
        velocity and measured its H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} activity index
        and its rotation velocity. Additionally, we have multiple
        observations of many stars to investigate if there are any
        radial velocity variations due to multiplicity. The results of
        our survey confirm that early-M dwarfs are
        H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} inactive with low rotational velocities
        and that late-M dwarfs are H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} active with
        very high rotational velocities. The results of this high-

	Abstract = {{We present high-resolution H- and K-band spectroscopic observations of
        the archetypal T Tauri star T Tau North. Synthetic spectral
        modeling is used to derive the K-band temperature, surface
        gravity, magnetic field strength, and rotational velocity for
        this star. The K-band spectroscopic temperature measured is
        ${T}_{K \mbox{-} \mathrm{band}}=3976\pm 90\,{\rm{K}}$ , which is
        $\sim 1000\,{\rm{K}}$ cooler than the temperature measured from
        optical observations. Our K-band temperature measurement for T
        Tau N is confirmed using equivalent-width line ratio versus
        temperature relations in the H band, from which a ${T}_{H
        \mbox{-} \mathrm{band}}=4085\pm 155\,{\rm{K}}$ is derived. This
        optical versus IR temperature difference is interpreted as cool
        or hot spots, or both, covering a significant part of the
        surface of T Tau N. The gravity derived for T Tau N,
        $\mathrm{log}g=3.45\pm 0.14$ , is lower than the gravity of
        nearly every other star in a sample of 24 classical T Tauri
        stars in Taurus. Combining these temperature and gravity results
        with magnetic stellar evolutionary models, we find the age of T
        Tau N to be less than 1 Myr old. These results suggest that T
        Tau N is in an earlier evolutionary stage than most classical T
        Tauri stars in Taurus, arguing that it is a protostar ejected
        from the embedded southern binary system shortly after its

	Abstract = {{We present K-band spectra for 133 nearby (d $\lt$ 33 ps) M dwarfs,
        including 18 M dwarfs with reliable metallicity estimates (as
        inferred from an FGK type companion), 11 M dwarf planet hosts,
        more than 2/3 of the M dwarfs in the northern 8 pc sample, and
        several M dwarfs from the LSPM catalog. From these spectra, we
        measure equivalent widths of the Ca and Na lines, and a spectral
        index quantifying the absorption due to H$_{2}$O opacity (the
        H$_{2}$O-K2 index). Using empirical spectral type standards and
        synthetic models, we calibrate the H$_{2}$O-K2 index as an
        indicator of an M dwarf's spectral type and effective
        temperature. We also present a revised relationship that
        estimates the [Fe/H] and [M/H] metallicities of M dwarfs from
        their Na I, Ca I, and H$_{2}$O-K2 measurements. Comparisons to
        model atmosphere provide a qualitative validation of our
        approach, but also reveal an overall offset between the atomic
        line strengths predicted by models as compared to actual
        observations. Our metallicity estimates also reproduce expected
        correlations with Galactic space motions and
        H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emission line strengths, and return
        statistically identical metallicities for M dwarfs within a
        common multiple system. Finally, we find systematic residuals
        between our H$_{2}$O-based spectral types and those derived from
        optical spectral features with previously known sensitivity to
        stellar metallicity, such as TiO, and identify the CaH1 index as
        a promising optical index for diagnosing the metallicities of
        near-solar M dwarfs.}},

	Abstract = {{Context. Spectra of astronomical targets acquired from ground-based
        instruments are affected by the atmospheric transmission. <BR />
        Aims: The authors and their institutes are developing a web-
        based service, TAPAS (Transmissions Atmosph{\'e}riques
        Personnalis{\'e}es pour l'AStronomie, or Transmissions of the
        AtmosPhere for AStromomical data). This service, freely
        available, is developed and maintained within the atmospheric
        ETHER data center. <BR /> Methods: TAPAS computes the
        atmospheric transmission in the line-of-sight (LOS) to the
        target indicated by the user. The user files a request
        indicating the time, ground location, and either the equatorial
        coordinates of the target or the zenith angle of the LOS. The
        actual atmospheric profile (temperature, pressure, humidity,
        ozone content) at that time and place is retrieved from the
        ETHER atmospheric database (from a combination of ECMWF
        meteorological field and other information), and the atmospheric
        transmission is computed from LBLRTM software and HITRAN
        database for a number of gases: O$_{2}$, H$_{2}$O, O$_{3}$,
        CO$_{2}$, CH$_{4}$, N$_{2}$O, and Rayleigh extinction. The first
        purpose of TAPAS output is to allow identifying observed
        spectral features having an atmospheric or astrophysical origin.
        The returned transmission may also serve for characterizing the
        spectrometer on the wavelength scale and instrument line
        spectral function (ILSF) by comparing one observed spectrum of
        an atmospheric feature to the transmission. Finally, the top of
        atmosphere (TOA) spectrum may be obtained either by division of
        the observed spectrum by the computed transmission or other
        techniques developed on purpose. The obtention of transmissions
        for individual species allows more potentialities and better
        adjustments to the data. <BR /> Results: In this paper, we
        briefly describe the mechanism of computation of the atmospheric
        transmissions, and we show some results for O$_{2}$ and H$_{2}$O
        atmospheric absorption. The wavelength range is presently
        500-2500 nm, but may be extended in the future. <BR />
        Conclusions: It is hoped that this service will help many
        astronomers in their research. The user may also contribute to
        the general knowledge of the atmospheric transmission, if he/she
        finds systematic discrepancies between synthetic transmissions
        and the observed spectra. This has already happened in the
        recent past. <P /><A href=``http://ether.ipsl.jussieu.fr/tapas/'

	Abstract = {{In incorporating the effect of atmospheric turbulence in the broadening
        of spectral lines, the so-called radial-tangential
        macroturbulence (RTM) model has been widely used in the field of
        solar-type stars, which was devised from intuitive appearance of
        the granular velocity field of the Sun. Since this model assumes
        that turbulent motions are restricted to only radial and
        tangential directions, it has a special broadening function with
        notably narrow width due to the projection effect, the validity
        of which has not yet been confirmed in practice. With the aim of
        checking whether this RTM model adequately represents the actual
        solar photospheric velocity field, we carried out an extensive
        study on the non-thermal velocity dispersion along the line of
        sight (V$_{los}$) by analyzing spectral lines at various points
        of the solar disk based on locally averaged as well as high-
        spatial-resolution spectra, and found the following results.
        First, the center-to-limb run of V$_{los}$ derived from ground-
        based low-resolution spectra is simply monotonic with a slightly
        increasing tendency, which contradicts the specific trend (an
        appreciable peak at {\ensuremath{\theta}} ≃ 45{\textdegree})
        predicted from RTM. Second, the V$_{los}$ values derived from a
        large number of spectra based on high-resolution space
        observation were revealed to follow a nearly normal
        distribution, without any sign of the peculiar distribution
        expected for the RTM case. These two observational facts
        indicate that the actual solar velocity field is not simply
        dichotomous as assumed in RTM, but directionally more chaotic.
        We thus conclude that RTM is not an adequate model, at least for
        solar-type stars, as it would significantly overestimate the
        turbulent velocity dispersion by a factor of
        {\ensuremath{\sim}}2. The classical Gaussian macroturbulence
        model should be more reasonable in this respect.}},

	Abstract = {{The coolest dwarf stars are intrinsically faint at visible wavelengths
        and exhibit rotationally modulated stellar activity from spots
        and plages. It is advantageous to observe these stars at near-
        infrared (NIR) wavelengths (1-2.5 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m) where
        they emit the bulk of their bolometric luminosity and are most
        quiescent. In this work, we describe our methodology and results
        in obtaining precise radial velocity (RV) measurements of low-
        mass stars using K-band spectra taken with the R
        {\ensuremath{\sim}} 80,000 iSHELL spectrograph and the NASA
        Infrared Telescope Facility using a methane isotopologue gas
        cell in the calibration unit. Our novel analysis pipeline
        extracts RVs by minimizing the rms of the residuals between the
        observed spectrum and a forward model. The model accounts for
        the gas cell, tellurics, blaze function, multiple sources of
        quasi-sinusoidal fringing, and line spread function of the
        spectrograph. The stellar template is derived iteratively using
        the target observations themselves through averaging barycenter-
        shifted residuals. We have demonstrated 5 m s$^{-1}$ precision
        over one-year timescales for the M4 dwarf
        Barnard{\textquoteright}s Star and K dwarf 61 Cygni A, and 3 m

        demonstrates the potential for iSHELL to determine dynamical

	Abstract = {{Context. The atmospheric absorption of the Earth is an important
        limiting factor for ground-based spectroscopic observations and
        the near-infrared and infrared regions are the most affected.
        Several software packages that produce a synthetic atmospheric
        transmission spectrum have been developed to correct for the
        telluric absorption; these are Molecfit, TelFit, and
        Transmissions Atmosph{\'e}riques Personnalis{\'e}es pour
        l'AStronomie (TAPAS). <BR /> Aims: Our goal is to compare the
        correction achieved using these three telluric correction
        packages and the division by a telluric standard star. We want
        to evaluate the best method to correct near-infrared high-
        resolution spectra as well as the limitations of each software
        package and methodology. <BR /> Methods: We applied the telluric
        correction methods to CRIRES archival data taken in the J and K
        bands. We explored how the achieved correction level varies
        depending on the atmospheric T-P profile used in the modelling,
        the depth of the atmospheric lines, and the molecules creating
        the absorption. <BR /> Results: We found that the Molecfit and
        TelFit corrections lead to smaller residuals for the water
        lines. The standard star method corrects best the oxygen lines.
        The Molecfit package and the standard star method corrections
        result in global offsets always below 0.5\% for all lines; the
        offset is similar with TelFit and TAPAS for the H$_{2}$O lines
        and around 1\% for the O$_{2}$ lines. All methods and software
        packages result in a scatter between 3\% and 7\% inside the
        telluric lines. The use of a tailored atmospheric profile for
        the observatory leads to a scatter two times smaller, and the
        correction level improves with lower values of precipitable
        water vapour. <BR /> Conclusions: The synthetic transmission
        methods lead to an improved correction compared to the standard
        star method for the water lines in the J band with no loss of
        telescope time, but the oxygen lines were better corrected by
        the standard star method.}},

	Abstract = {We compare the structures of model atmospheres and synthetic spectra calculated using different line lists for TiO and water vapor. We discuss the effects of different line list combinations on the model structures and spectra for both dwarf and giant stars. It is shown that recent improvements result in significantly improved spectra, in particular, in the optical where TiO bands are important. The water vapor-dominated near-infrared region remains problematic as the current water line lists do not yet completely reproduce the shapes of the observed spectra. We find that the AMES TiO list provides more opacity in most bands and that the new, smaller oscillator strengths lead to systematically cooler temperatures for early-type M dwarfs than previous models. These effects combine and will help to significantly improve the fits of models to observations in the optical as well as result in improved synthetic photometry of M stars. We show that the Davis, Littleton, & Phillips fel-values for the δ and φ bands of TiO best reproduce the observed V-I color indices.},

	Abstract = {{Context. High resolution stellar spectral atlases are valuable resources
        to astronomy. They are rare in the 1-5 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m
        region for historical reasons, but once available, high
        resolution atlases in this part of the spectrum will aid the
        study of a wide range of astrophysical phenomena. <BR /> Aims:
        The aim of the CRIRES-POP project is to produce a high
        resolution near-infrared spectral library of stars across the
        H-R diagram. The aim of this paper is to present the fully
        reduced spectrum of the K giant 10 Leo that will form the basis
        of the first atlas within the CRIRES-POP library, to provide a
        full description of the data reduction processes involved, and
        to provide an update on the CRIRES-POP project. <BR /> Methods:
        All CRIRES-POP targets were observed with almost 200 different
        observational settings of CRIRES on the ESO Very Large
        Telescope, resulting in a basically complete coverage of its
        spectral range as accessible from the ground. We reduced the
        spectra of 10 Leo with the CRIRES pipeline, corrected the
        wavelength solution and removed telluric absorption with
        Molecfit, then resampled the spectra to a common wavelength
        scale, shifted them to rest wavelengths, flux normalised, and
        median combined them into one final data product. <BR />
        Results: We present the fully reduced, high resolution, near-
        infrared spectrum of 10 Leo. This is also the first complete
        spectrum from the CRIRES instrument. The spectrum is available
        online. <BR /> Conclusions: The first CRIRES-POP spectrum has
        exceeded our quality expectations and will form the centre of a
        state-of-the-art stellar atlas. This first CRIRES-POP atlas will
        soon be available, and further atlases will follow. All CRIRES-
        POP data products will be freely and publicly available online.

	Abstract = {{The search for Earth-like planets around late-type stars using
        ultrastable spectrographs requires a very precise
        characterization of the stellar activity and the magnetic cycle
        of the star, since these phenomena induce radial velocity (RV)
        signals that can be misinterpreted as planetary signals. Among
        the nearby stars, we have selected Barnard's Star (Gl 699) to
        carry out a characterization of these phenomena using a set of
        spectroscopic data that covers about 14.5 yr and comes from
        seven different spectrographs: HARPS, HARPS-N, CARMENES, HIRES,
        UVES, APF, and PFS; and a set of photometric data that covers
        about 15.1 yr and comes from four different photometric sources:
        ASAS, FCAPT-RCT, AAVSO, and SNO. We have measured different
        chromospheric activity indicators (H {\ensuremath{\alpha}}, Ca
        II HK, and Na I D), as well as the full width at half-maximum
        (FWHM), of the cross-correlation function computed for a sub-set
        of the spectroscopic data. The analysis of generalized Lomb-
        Scargle periodograms of the time series of different activity
        indicators reveals that the rotation period of the star is 145
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 15 d, consistent with the expected rotation
        period according to the low activity level of the star and
        previous claims. The upper limit of the predicted activity-
        induced RV signal corresponding to this rotation period is about
        1 m s$^{-1}$. We also find evidence of a long-term cycle of 10
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 2 yr that is consistent with previous
        estimates of magnetic cycles from photometric time series in
        other M stars of similar activity levels. The available
        photometric data of the star also support the detection of both
        the long-term and the rotation signals.}},

	Abstract = {{Given that low-mass stars have intrinsically low luminosities at optical
        wavelengths and a propensity for stellar activity, it is
        advantageous for radial velocity (RV) surveys of these objects
        to use near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths. In this work, we
        describe and test a novel RV extraction pipeline dedicated to
        retrieving RVs from low-mass stars using NIR spectra taken by
        the CSHELL spectrograph at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility,
        where a methane isotopologue gas cell is used for wavelength
        calibration. The pipeline minimizes the residuals between the
        observations and a spectral model composed of templates for the
        target star, the gas cell, and atmospheric telluric absorption;
        models of the line-spread function, continuum curvature, and
        sinusoidal fringing; and a parameterization of the wavelength
        solution. The stellar template is derived iteratively from the
        science observations themselves without a need for separate
        observations dedicated to retrieving it. Despite limitations
        from CSHELL{\textquoteright}s narrow wavelength range and
        instrumental systematics, we are able to (1) obtain an RV
        precision of 35 m s$^{-1}$ for the RV standard star GJ 15 A over
        a time baseline of 817 days, reaching the photon noise limit for
        our attained signal-to-noise ratio; (2) achieve ̃3 m s$^{-1}$ RV
        precision for the M giant SV Peg over a baseline of several days
        and confirm its long-term RV trend due to stellar pulsations, as
        well as obtain nightly noise floors of ̃2-6 m s$^{-1}$ and (3)
        show that our data are consistent with the known masses,
        periods, and orbital eccentricities of the two most massive
        planets orbiting GJ 876. Future applications of our pipeline to
        RV surveys using the next generation of NIR spectrographs, such
        as iSHELL, will enable the potential detection of super-Earths
        and mini-Neptunes in the habitable zones of M dwarfs.}},

	Abstract = {{In recent years, dedicated extreme precision radial velocity (RV)
        spectrographs have produced vast quantities of high-resolution,
        high-signal-to-noise (S/N) time-series spectra for bright stars.
        These data contain valuable information for the dual purposes of
        planet detection via the measured RVs and stellar
        characterization via the coadded spectra. However, considerable
        data analysis challenges exist in extracting these data products
        from the observed spectra at the highest possible precision,
        including the issue of poorly characterized telluric absorption
        features and the common use of an assumed stellar spectral
        template. In both of these examples, precision-limiting reliance
        on external information can be sidestepped using the data
        directly. Here we propose a data-driven method to simultaneously
        extract precise RVs and infer the underlying stellar and
        telluric spectra using a linear model (in the log of flux). The
        model employs a convex objective and convex regularization to
        keep the optimization of the spectral components fast. We
        implement this method in wobble, an open-source python package
        that uses TensorFlow in one of its first non-neural-network
        applications to astronomical data. In this work, we demonstrate
        the performance of wobble on archival High Accuracy Radial
        Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) spectra. We recover the
        canonical exoplanet 51 Pegasi b, detect the secular RV evolution
        of the M dwarf Barnard{\textquoteright}s Star, and retrieve the
        Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for the hot Jupiter HD 189733b. The
        method additionally produces extremely high-S/N composite
        stellar spectra and detailed time-variable telluric spectra,
        which we also present here.}},

	Abstract = {{Multiple codes are available to derive atmospheric parameters and
        individual chemical abundances from high-resolution spectra of
        AFGKM stars. Almost all spectroscopists have their own
        preferences regarding which code and method to use. But the
        intrinsic differences between codes and methods lead to complex
        systematics that depend on multiple variables such as the
        selected spectral regions and the radiative transfer code used.
        I expand ISPEC, a popular open-source spectroscopic tool, to
        support the most well-known radiative transfer codes and assess
        their similarities and biases when using multiple set-ups based
        on the equivalent-width method and the synthetic spectral-
        fitting technique (interpolating from a pre-computed grid of
        spectra or synthesizing with interpolated model atmospheres).
        This work shows that systematic differences on atmospheric
        parameters and abundances between most of the codes can be
        reduced when using the same method and executing a careful
        spectral feature selection. However, it may not be possible to
        ignore the remaining differences, depending on the particular
        case and the required precision. Regarding methods, equivalent-
        width-based and spectrum-fitting analyses exhibit large
        differences that are caused by their intrinsic differences,
        which is significant given the popularity of these two methods.
        The results help to identify the key caveats of modern
        spectroscopy that all scientists should be aware of before
        trusting their own results or being tempted to combine
        atmospheric parameters and abundances from the literature.}},

	Abstract = {{<BR /> Aims: We propose a method for measuring the projected rotational
        velocity vsini with high precision even in spectra with blended
        lines. Though not automatic, our method is designed to be
        applied systematically to large numbers of objects without
        excessive computational requirement. <BR /> Methods: We
        calculated the cross correlation function (CCF) of the object
        spectrum against a zero-rotation template and used the Fourier
        transform (FT) of the CCF central maximum to measure the
        parameter vsini taking the limb darkening effect and its
        wavelength dependence into account. The procedure also improves
        the definition of the CCF base line, resulting in errors related
        to the continuum position under 1\% even for vsini = 280 km
        s$^{-1}$. Tests with high-resolution spectra of F-type stars
        indicate that an accuracy well below 1\% can be attained even
        for spectra where most lines are blended. <BR /> Results: We
        have applied the method to measuring vsini in 251 A-type stars.
        For stars with vsini over 30 km s$^{-1}$ (2-3 times our spectra
        resolution), our measurement errors are below 2.5\% with a
        typical value of 1\%. We compare our results with Royer et al.
        (2002a) using 155 stars in common, finding systematic
        differences of about 5\% for rapidly rotating stars.}},

	Abstract = {{We go through the many considerations involved in fitting a model to
        data, using as an example the fit of a straight line to a set of
        points in a two-dimensional plane. Standard weighted least-
        squares fitting is only appropriate when there is a dimension
        along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and
        another along which all the uncertainties can be described by
        Gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met in
        practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and
        arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and
        situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown
        uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the
        linear relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize the
        importance of having a ``generative model'' for the data, even
        an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the
        subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary because the model permits
        direct computation of the likelihood of the parameters or the
        posterior probability distribution. Construction of a posterior
        probability distribution is indispensible if there are

	Abstract = {{In 1989, Semel proposed a new technique (dubbed Zeeman-Doppler imaging
        or ZDI) for measuring and mapping magnetic fields at the surface
        of cool active stars from sets of rotationally modulated
        circularly polarised (Stokes V) profiles of spectral lines. Two
        years later, an automatic tool (based on maximum entropy image
        reconstruction techniques) was developed and checked on a few
        test cases (Brown et al., 1991A\&amp;A...250..463B). In
        particular, this paper established that surface magnetic
        distributions consisting in circular regions of radially
        oriented field can be very well recovered with ZDI. In the
        present paper, we show new simulations demonstrating that ZDI is
        good at reconstructing the field orientation within magnetic
        regions. In particular, it can always unambiguously identify
        azimuthal from radial/meridional field features (where radial,
        azimuthal and meridional refer to the three vector field
        components in spherical geometry). For high latitude magnetic
        spots, all three field components can be recovered. For low

        Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) that will focus on two
        forefront science topics, (i) the quest for habitable Earthlike
        planets around nearby M stars and (ii) the study of low-mass
        star/planet formation in the presence of magnetic fields. SPIRou
        will also efficiently tackle many key programs beyond these two
        main goals, from weather patterns on brown dwarfs to solar
        system planet and exoplanet atmospheres. SPIRou will cover a
        wide spectral domain in a single exposure (0.98-2.44
        {\ensuremath{\mu}}m) at a resolving power of 70 K, yielding
        unpolarized and polarized spectra of low-mass stars with a 15\%
        average throughput at a radial velocity (RV) precision of 1 m
        s$^{-1}$. It consists of a Cassegrain unit mounted at the
        Cassegrain focus of CFHT and featuring an achromatic
        polarimeter, coupled to a cryogenic spectrograph cooled down at
        80 K through a fluoride fiber link. SPIRou is currently
        integrated at IRAP/OMP and will be mounted at CFHT in 2018 Q1
        for a first light scheduled in early 2018. Science operation is

	Abstract = {{Brown dwarf atmospheres form molecules, then high temperature
        condensates (corundum, titanates, silicates, and iron
        compounds), and then low temperature condensates (ices) as they
        cool down over time. These produce large opacities which govern
        entirely their spectral energy distribution. Just as it is
        important to know molecular opacities (TiO, H\_2O, CH\_4, etc.)
        with accuracy, it is imperative to understand the interplay of
        processes (e.g. condensation, sedimentation, coagulation,
        convection) that determines the radial and size distribution of
        grains. Limiting case models have shown that young, hot brown
        (L) dwarfs form dust mostly in equilibrium, while at much cooler
        stages (late T dwarfs) all high temperature condensates have
        sedimented out of their photospheres. But this process is
        gradual and all intermediate classes of brown dwarfs can partly
        be understood in terms of partial sedimentation of dust. With
        new models accounting for these processes, we describe the

	Abstract = {{Context. Observationally, spectra of brown dwarfs indicate the presence
        of dust in their atmospheres while theoretically it is not clear
        what prevents the dust from settling and disappearing from the
        regions of spectrum formation. Consequently, standard models
        have to rely on ad hoc assumptions about the mechanism that
        keeps dust grains aloft in the atmosphere. <BR /> Aims: We apply
        hydrodynamical simulations to develop an improved physical
        understanding of the mixing properties of macroscopic flows in M
        dwarf and brown dwarf atmospheres, in particular of the
        influence of the underlying convection zone. <BR /> Methods: We
        performed two-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations
        including a description of dust grain formation and transport
        with the CO5BOLD code. The simulations cover the very top of the
        convection zone and the photosphere including the dust layers
        for a sequence of effective temperatures between 900 K and 2800
        K, all with log g = 5 assuming solar chemical composition. <BR
        /> Results: Convective overshoot occurs in the form of
        exponentially declining velocities with small scale heights, so
        that it affects only the region immediately above the almost
        adiabatic convective layers. From there on, mixing is provided
        by gravity waves that are strong enough to maintain thin dust
        clouds in the hotter models. With decreasing effective
        temperature, the amplitudes of the waves become smaller but the
        clouds become thicker and develop internal convective flows that
        are more efficient in transporting and mixing material than
        gravity waves. The presence of clouds often leads to a highly
        structured appearance of the stellar surface on short temporal
        and small spatial scales (presently inaccessible to
        observations). <BR /> Conclusions: We identify convectively
        excited gravity waves as an essential mixing process in M dwarf
        and brown dwarf atmospheres. Under conditions of strong cloud
        formation, dust convection is the dominant self-sustaining
        mixing component.}},

	Abstract = {{In the last decade, the photospheric solar metallicity as determined
        from spectroscopy experienced a remarkable downward revision.
        Part of this effect can be attributed to an improvement of
        atomic data and the inclusion of NLTE computations, but also the
        use of hydrodynamical model atmospheres seemed to play a role.
        This ``decrease'' with time of the metallicity of the solar
        photosphere increased the disagreement with the results from
        helioseismology. With a CO $^{5}$ BOLD 3D model of the solar
        atmosphere, the CIFIST team at the Paris Observatory re-
        determined the photospheric solar abundances of several
        elements, among them C, N, and O. The spectroscopic abundances
        are obtained by fitting the equivalent width and/or the profile
        of observed spectral lines with synthetic spectra computed from
        the 3D model atmosphere. We conclude that the effects of
        granular fluctuations depend on the characteristics of the
        individual lines, but are found to be relevant only in a few
        particular cases. 3D effects are not responsible for the
        systematic lowering of the solar abundances in recent years. The
        solar metallicity resulting from this analysis is Z=0.0153, Z/

        limit that consistently couple atmosphere and interior
        structures, thereby superseding the widely used BCAH98 models.
        The new models include updated molecular linelists and solar
        abundances, as well as atmospheric convection parameters
        calibrated on 2D/3D radiative hydrodynamics simulations.
        Comparison of these models with observations in various colour-
        magnitude diagrams for various ages shows significant
        improvement over previous generations of models. The new models
        can solve flaws that are present in the previous ones, such as
        the prediction of optical colours that are too blue compared to
        M dwarf observations. They can also reproduce the four
        components of the young quadruple system LkCa 3 in a colour-
        magnitude diagram with one single isochrone, in contrast to any
        presently existing model. In this paper we also highlight the
        need for consistency when comparing models and observations,
        with the necessity of using evolutionary models and colours
        based on the same atmospheric structures.}},

	Abstract = {I present the widely used model atmosphere codes ATLAS, MARCS, and PHOENIX, and I compare their output model structures and spectra for cool stars of FGKM-types. While model atmosphere stratifications agree closely with each other in the f-D approximation, this is not the case for spectra. Differences between model spectra from different codes are largest in the blue-UV, but smaller differences appear in all regions, especially in the molecular features of cooler model spectra. I recommend the groups to try to solve these discrepancies together. In the meantime, users must be careful when using these spectra in regimes where they differ.
I discuss here only comparisons of spectra at solar metallicity, and this should be extended to other metallicities. Detailed comparisons with carefully calibrated spectrophotometric data, and high resolution spectra for stars with well known parameters are also of prime importance. It appears that we still need better line positions for molecules. Finally we should remember that f-D models are only a step towards a better representation of reality, and we should keep developing, and carefully test 3-D, NLTE models.},

	Abstract = {{Context: In analyses of stellar spectra and colours, and for the
        analysis of integrated light from galaxies, a homogeneous grid
        of model atmospheres of late-type stars and corresponding flux
        spectra is needed. <BR />Aims: We construct an extensive grid of
        spherically-symmetric models (supplemented with plane-parallel
        ones for the highest surface gravities), built on up-to-date
        atomic and molecular data, and make it available for public use.
        <BR />Methods: The most recent version of the MARCS program is
        used. <BR />Results: We present a grid of about {}10$^{4}$ model
        atmospheres for stars with 2500 K {\ensuremath{\leq}} T\_eff
        {\ensuremath{\leq}} 8000 K, -1 {\ensuremath{\leq}} log g = log
        (GM/R\^2) {\ensuremath{\leq}} 5 (cgs) with various masses and
        radii, -5 {\ensuremath{\leq}} [Me/H] {\ensuremath{\leq}} +1,
        with [ {\ensuremath{\alpha}}/Fe] = 0.0 and 0.4 and different
        choices of C and N abundances. This includes {\textquotedblleft
        }CN-cycled{\textquotedblright} models with C/N = 4.07 (solar),
        1.5 and 0.5, C/O ranging from 0.09 to (normally) 5.0 to also
        represent stars of spectral types R, S and N, and with 1.0
        {\ensuremath{\leq}} {\ensuremath{\xi}}$_{t}$ {\ensuremath{\leq}}
        5 km s$^{-1}$. We also list thermodynamic quantities (T, P\_g,
        P\_e, {\ensuremath{\rho}}, partial pressures of molecules, etc.)
        and provide them on the World Wide Web, as well as calculated
        fluxes in approximately 108 000 wavelength points. Underlying
        assumptions in addition to 1D stratification (spherical or
        plane-parallel) include hydrostatic equilibrium, mixing-length
        convection and local thermodynamic equilibrium. We discuss a
        number of general properties of the models, in particular in
        relation to the effects of changing abundances, of blanketing,
        and of sphericity. We illustrate positive and negative feedbacks
        between sphericity and molecular blanketing. We compare the
        models with those of other available grids and find excellent
        agreement with plane-parallel models of Castelli \&amp; Kurucz
        (if convection is treated consistently) within the overlapping
        parameter range. Although there are considerable departures from
        the spherically-symmetric NextGen models, the agreement with
        more recent PHOENIX models is gratifying. <BR />Conclusions: The
        models of the grid show considerable regularities, but some
        interesting departures from general patterns occur for the
        coolest models due to the molecular opacities. We have tested a
        number of approximate {\textquotedblleft}rules of
        thumb{\textquotedblright} concerning effects of blanketing and
        sphericity and often found them to be astonishingly accurate.
        Some interesting new phenomena have been discovered and
        explored, such as the intricate coupling between blanketing and
        sphericity, and the strong effects of carbon enhancement on
        metal-poor models. We give further details of line absorption
        data for molecules, as well as details of models and comparisons
        with observations in subsequent papers.}},

        elusive objects and the modeling of their photosphere has long
        remained a challenge (molecular opacities, dust cloud
        formation). <BR /> Aims: Our objectives are to validate the BT-
        Settl model atmospheres, update the M dwarf T$_{eff}$-spectral
        type relation, and find the atmospheric parameters of the stars
        in our sample. <BR /> Methods: We compare two samples of optical
        spectra covering the whole M dwarf sequence with the most recent
        BT-Settl synthetic spectra and use a {\ensuremath{\chi}}$^{2}$
        minimization technique to determine T$_{eff}$. The first sample
        consists of 97 low-resolution spectra obtained with New
        Technology Telescope (NTT) at La Silla Observatory. The second
        sample contains 55 medium-resolution spectra obtained at the
        Siding Spring Observatory (SSO). The spectral typing is realized
        by comparison with already classified M dwarfs. <BR /> Results:
        We show that the BT-Settl synthetic spectra reproduce the slope
        of the spectral energy distribution and most of its features.
        Only the CaOH band at 5570 {\r{A}} and AlH and NaH hydrides in
        the blue part of the spectra are still missing in the models.
        The T$_{eff}$ scale obtained with the higher resolved SSO 2.3 m
        spectra is consistent with that obtained with the NTT spectra.
        We compare our T$_{eff}$ scale with those of other authors and
        with published isochrones using the BT-Settl colors. We also
        present relations between effective temperature, spectral type,
        and colors of the M dwarfs. Tables 1 and 2 are available in

	Abstract = {{We present opacity sampling model atmospheres, synthetic spectra, and
        colors for brown dwarfs and very low mass stars in the following
        two limiting cases of dust grain formation: (1) Inefficient
        gravitational settling (i.e., the dust is distributed according
        to the chemical equilibrium predictions) and (2) efficient
        gravitational settling (i.e., the dust forms and depletes
        refractory elements from the gas, but their opacity does not
        affect the thermal structure). The models include the formation
        of over 600 gas-phase species and 1000 liquids and crystals and
        the opacities of 30 different types of grains including corundum
        (Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$), the magnesium aluminum spinel
        MgAl$_{2}$O$_{4}$, iron, enstatite (MgSiO$_{3}$), forsterite
        (Mg$_{2}$SiO$_{4}$), amorphous carbon, SiC, and a number of
        calcium silicates. The models extend from the beginning of the
        grain formation regime well into the condensation regime of
        water ice (T$_{eff}$=3000-100 K) and encompass the range of
        logg=2.5-6.0 at solar metallicity. We find that silicate dust
        grains can form abundantly in the outer atmospheric layers of
        red and brown dwarfs with a spectral type later than M8. The
        greenhouse effects of dust opacities provide a natural
        explanation for the peculiarly red spectroscopic distribution of
        the latest M dwarfs and young brown dwarfs. The grainless (cond)
        models, on the other hand, correspond closely to methane brown
        dwarfs such as Gliese 229B. We also discover that the

        and {\ensuremath{\lambda}}{\ensuremath{\lambda}}7687, 7701 K I

	Abstract = {{Optical velocimetry has led to the detection of more than 500 planets to
        date and there is a strong effort to push m/s velocimetry to the
        near-infrared to access cooler and lighter stars. The presence
        of numerous telluric absorption lines in the nIR brings an
        important challenge. As the star's barycentric velocity varies
        through the year, the telluric absorption lines effectively
        varies in velocity relative to the star's spectrum by the same
        amount leading to important systematic RV offsets. We present a
        novel Principal component analysis-based approach for telluric
        line subtraction and demonstrated its effectiveness with
        archival HARPS data for GJ436 and {\ensuremath{\tau}} Ceti, over
        parts of the R-band that contain strong telluric absorption
        lines. The main results are: 1) a better RV accuracy with
        excluding only a few percentage of the domain, 2) better use of
        the entire spectrum to measure RV and 3) a higher telescope time

	Abstract = {{Ages and masses of young stars are often estimated by comparing their
        luminosities and effective temperatures to pre-main-sequence
        stellar evolution tracks, but magnetic fields and starspots
        complicate both the observations and evolution. To understand
        their influence, we study the heavily spotted weak-lined T-Tauri
        star LkCa 4 by searching for spectral signatures of radiation
        originating from the starspot or starspot groups. We introduce a
        new methodology for constraining both the starspot filling
        factor and the spot temperature by fitting two-temperature
        stellar atmosphere models constructed from Phoenix synthetic
        spectra to a high-resolution near-IR IGRINS spectrum. Clearly
        discernable spectral features arise from both a hot photospheric
        component \{T\}$_{\{hot}$\} ̃ 4100 K and a cool component
        \{T\}$_{\{cool}$\} ̃ 2700-3000 K, which covers ̃80\% of the
        visible surface. This mix of hot and cool emission is supported
        by analyses of the spectral energy distribution, rotational
        modulation of colors and of TiO band strengths, and features in
        low-resolution optical/near-IR spectroscopy. Although the
        revised effective temperature and luminosity make LkCa 4 appear
        to be much younger and of much lower mass than previous
        estimates from unspotted stellar evolution models, appropriate
        estimates will require the production and adoption of spotted
        evolutionary models. Biases from starspots likely afflict most
        fully convective young stars and contribute to uncertainties in
        ages and age spreads of open clusters. In some spectral regions,
        starspots act as a featureless
        {\textquotedblleft}veiling{\textquotedblright} continuum owing
        to high rotational broadening and heavy line blanketing in cool
        star spectra. Some evidence is also found for an anticorrelation
        between the velocities of the warm and cool components.}},

	Abstract = {{Knowledge of late K and M dwarf metallicities can be used to guide
        planet searches and constrain planet formation models. However,
        the determination of metallicities of late-type stars is
        difficult because visible wavelength spectra of their cool
        atmospheres contain many overlapping absorption lines,
        preventing the measurement of equivalent widths. We present new
        methods, and improved calibrations of existing methods, to
        determine metallicities of late K and M dwarfs from moderate
        resolution (1300 \&lt; R \&lt; 2000) visible and infrared
        spectra. We select a sample of 112 wide binary systems that
        contain a late-type companion to a solar-type primary star. Our
        sample includes 62 primary stars with previously published
        metallicities, as well as 50 stars with metallicities determined
        from our own observations. We use our sample to empirically
        determine which features in the spectrum of the companion are
        best correlated with the metallicity of the primary. We find
        sime120 features in K and M dwarf spectra that are useful for
        predicting metallicity. We derive metallicity calibrations for
        different wavelength ranges, and show that it is possible to get
        metallicities reliable to \&lt;0.10 dex using either visible,
        J-, H-, or K-band spectra. We find that the most accurate
        metallicities derived from visible spectra requires the use of
        different calibrations for early-type (K5.5-M2) and late-type
        (M2-M6) dwarfs. Our calibrations are applicable to dwarfs with
        metallicities of -1.04 \&lt; [Fe/H] \&lt;+0.56 and spectral
        types from K7 to M5. Lastly, we use our sample of wide binaries
        to test and refine existing calibrations to determine M dwarf
        metallicities. We find that the {\ensuremath{\zeta}} parameter,
        which measures the ratio of TiO can CaH bands, is correlated
        with [Fe/H] for super-solar metallicities, and
        {\ensuremath{\zeta}} does not always correctly identify metal-
        poor M dwarfs. We also find that existing calibrations in the K
        and H bands are quite reliable for stars with [Fe/H] \&gt;-0.5,
        but are less useful for more metal-poor stars.}},

        to determine abundances on a line-by-line basis. We performed a
        detailed homogeneous analysis of the systematic uncertainties,
        such as differential versus absolute abundance analysis. We also
        assessed errors that are due to non-local thermal equilibrium
        and the stellar parameters in our final abundances. <BR />
        Results: Our results are provided by listing final abundances
        and the different sources of uncertainties, as well as line-by-
        line and method-by-method abundances. <BR /> Conclusions: The
        atmospheric parameters of the Gaia FGK benchmark stars are
        already being widely used for calibration of several pipelines
        that are applied to different surveys. With the added reference
        abundances of ten elements, this set is very suitable for
        calibrating the chemical abundances obtained by these pipelines.

	Abstract = {{Context. In the era of large Galactic stellar surveys, carefully
        calibrating and validating the data sets has become an important
        and integral part of the data analysis. Moreover, new
        generations of stellar atmosphere models and spectral line
        formation computations need to be subjected to benchmark tests
        to assess any progress in predicting stellar properties. <BR />
        Aims: We focus on cool stars and aim at establishing a sample of
        34 Gaia FGK benchmark stars with a range of different
        metallicities. The goal was to determine the effective
        temperature and the surface gravity independently of
        spectroscopy and atmospheric models as far as possible. Most of
        the selected stars have been subjected to frequent spectroscopic
        investigations in the past, and almost all of them have
        previously been used as reference, calibration, or test objects.
        <BR /> Methods: Fundamental determinations of T$_{eff}$ and log
        g were obtained in a systematic way from a compilation of
        angular diameter measurements and bolometric fluxes and from a
        homogeneous mass determination based on stellar evolution
        models. The derived parameters were compared to recent
        spectroscopic and photometric determinations and to gravity
        estimates based on seismic data. <BR /> Results: Most of the
        adopted diameter measurements have formal uncertainties around
        1\%, which translate into uncertainties in effective temperature
        of 0.5\%. The measurements of bolometric flux seem to be
        accurate to 5\% or better, which contributes about 1\% or less
        to the uncertainties in effective temperature. The comparisons
        of parameter determinations with the literature in general show
        good agreements with a few exceptions, most notably for the
        coolest stars and for metal-poor stars. <BR /> Conclusions: The
        sample consists of 29 FGK-type stars and 5 M giants. Among the
        FGK stars, 21 have reliable parameters suitable for testing,
        validation, or calibration purposes. For four stars, future
        adjustments of the fundamental T$_{eff}$ are required, and for
        five stars the log g determination needs to be improved. Future
        extensions of the sample of Gaia FGK benchmark stars are
        required to fill gaps in parameter space, and we include a list
        of suggested candidates.}},

	Abstract = {{<BR /> Aims: We determine the radii and masses of 293 nearby, bright M
        dwarfs of the CARMENES survey. This is the first time that such
        a large and homogeneous high-resolution (R \&gt; 80 000)
        spectroscopic survey has been used to derive these fundamental
        stellar parameters. <BR /> Methods: We derived the radii using
        Stefan-Boltzmann's law. We obtained the required effective
        temperatures T$_{eff}$ from a spectral analysis and we obtained
        the required luminosities L from integrated broadband photometry
        together with the Gaia DR2 parallaxes. The mass was then
        determined using a mass-radius relation that we derived from
        eclipsing binaries known in the literature. We compared this
        method with three other methods: (1) We calculated the mass from
        the radius and the surface gravity log g, which was obtained
        from the same spectral analysis as T$_{eff}$. (2) We used a
        widely used infrared mass-magnitude relation. (3) We used a
        Bayesian approach to infer stellar parameters from the
        comparison of the absolute magnitudes and colors of our targets
        with evolutionary models. <BR /> Results: Between spectral types
        M0 V and M7 V our radii cover the range 0.1 R$_{☉}$ \&lt; R
        \&lt; 0.6 R$_{☉}$ with an error of 2-3\% and our masses cover
        0.09 ℳ$_{☉}$ \&lt; ℳ\&lt; 0.6ℳ$_{☉}$ with an error of 3-5\%. We
        find good agreement between the masses determined with these
        different methods for most of our targets. Only the masses of
        very young objects show discrepancies. This can be well
        explained with the assumptions that we used for our methods.

	Abstract = {{We present precise photospheric parameters of 282 M dwarfs determined
        from fitting the most recent version of PHOENIX models to high-
        resolution CARMENES spectra in the visible (0.52-0.96
        {\ensuremath{\mu}}m) and NIR wavelength range (0.96-1.71
        {\ensuremath{\mu}}m). With its aim to search for habitable
        planets around M dwarfs, several planets of different masses
        have been detected. The characterization of the target sample is
        important for the ability to derive and constrain the physical
        properties of any planetary systems that are detected. As a
        continuation of previous work in this context, we derived the
        fundamental stellar parameters effective temperature, surface
        gravity, and metallicity of the CARMENES M-dwarf targets from
        PHOENIX model fits using a {\ensuremath{\chi}}$^{2}$ method. We
        calculated updated PHOENIX stellar atmosphere models that
        include a new equation of state to especially account for
        spectral features of low-temperature stellar atmospheres as well
        as new atomic and molecular line lists. We show the importance
        of selecting magnetically insensitive lines for fitting to avoid
        effects of stellar activity in the line profiles. For the first
        time, we directly compare stellar parameters derived from
        multiwavelength range spectra, simultaneously observed for the
        same star. In comparison with literature values we show that
        fundamental parameters derived from visible spectra and visible
        and NIR spectra combined are in better agreement than those
        derived from the same spectra in the NIR alone. Full Tables B.1

	Abstract = {{Context. The new CARMENES instrument comprises two high-resolution and
        high-stability spectrographs that are used to search for
        habitable planets around M dwarfs in the visible and near-
        infrared regime via the Doppler technique. <BR /> Aims:
        Characterising our target sample is important for constraining
        the physical properties of any planetary systems that are
        detected. The aim of this paper is to determine the fundamental
        stellar parameters of the CARMENES M-dwarf target sample from
        high-resolution spectra observed with CARMENES. We also include
        several M-dwarf spectra observed with other high-resolution
        spectrographs, that is CAFE, FEROS, and HRS, for completeness.
        <BR /> Methods: We used a {\ensuremath{\chi}}$^{2}$ method to
        derive the stellar parameters effective temperature T$_{eff}$,
        surface gravity logg, and metallicity [Fe/H] of the target stars
        by fitting the most recent version of the PHOENIX-ACES models to
        high-resolution spectroscopic data. These stellar atmosphere
        models incorporate a new equation of state to describe spectral
        features of low-temperature stellar atmospheres. Since
        T$_{eff}$, logg, and [Fe/H] show degeneracies, the surface
        gravity is determined independently using stellar evolutionary
        models. <BR /> Results: We derive the stellar parameters for a
        total of 300 stars. The fits achieve very good agreement between
        the PHOENIX models and observed spectra. We estimate that our
        method provides parameters with uncertainties of
        {\ensuremath{\sigma}}$_{Teff}$ = 51 K,
        {\ensuremath{\sigma}}$_{log g}$ = 0.07, and
        {\ensuremath{\sigma}}$_{[Fe/H]}$ = 0.16, and show that
        atmosphere models for low-mass stars have significantly improved
        in the last years. Our work also provides an independent test of
        the new PHOENIX-ACES models, and a comparison for other methods
        using low-resolution spectra. In particular, our effective
        temperatures agree well with literature values, while
        metallicities determined with our method exhibit a larger spread
        when compared to literature results. Full Table A.1 is only

	Abstract = {{Context. Being the most numerous and oldest stars in the galaxy, M
        dwarfs are objects of great interest for exoplanet searches. The
        presence of molecules in their atmosphere complicates our
        understanding of their atmospheric properties. But great
        advances have recently been made in the modeling of M dwarfs due
        to the revision of solar abundances. <BR /> Aims: We aim to
        determine stellar parameters of M dwarfs using high resolution
        spectra (R ̃ 90 000) simultaneously in the visible and the near-
        infrared. The high resolution spectra and broad wavelength
        coverage provide an unique opportunity to understand the onset
        of dust and cloud formation at cool temperatures. Furthermore,
        this study will help in understanding the physical processes
        which occur in a cool atmospheres, particularly, the
        redistribution of energy from the optical to the near-infrared.
        <BR /> Methods: The stellar parameters of M dwarfs in our sample
        have been determined by comparing the high resolution spectra
        both in the optical and in the near-infrared simultaneously
        observed by CARMENES with the synthetic spectra obtained from
        the BT-Settl model atmosphere. The detailed spectral synthesis
        of these observed spectra both in the optical and in the near-
        infrared helps to understand the missing continuum opacity. <BR
        /> Results: For the first time, we derive fundamental stellar
        parameters of M dwarfs using the high resolution optical and
        near-infrared spectra simultaneously. We determine T$_{eff}$,
        log g and [M/H] for 292 M dwarfs of spectral type M0 to M9,
        where the formation of dust and clouds are important. The
        derived T$_{eff}$ for the sample ranges from 2300 to 4000 K,
        values of log g ranges from 4.5 {\ensuremath{\leq}} logg
        {\ensuremath{\leq}} 5.5 and the resulting metallicity ranges
        from -0.5 {\ensuremath{\leq}} [M/H] {\ensuremath{\leq}} +0.5. We
        have also explored the possible differences in T$_{eff}$, log g
        and [M/H] by comparing them with other studies of the same
        sample of M dwarfs. Table 2 is only available at the CDS via

	Abstract = {{Context. M dwarfs are an important source of information when studying
        and probing the lower end of the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR)
        diagram, down to the hydrogen-burning limit. Being the most
        numerous and oldest stars in the galaxy, they carry fundamental
        information on its chemical history. The presence of molecules
        in their atmospheres, along with various condensed species,
        complicates our understanding of their physical properties and
        thus makes the determination of their fundamental stellar
        parameters more challenging and difficult. Aim. The aim of this
        study is to perform a detailed spectroscopic analysis of the
        high-resolution H-band spectra of M dwarfs in order to determine
        their fundamental stellar parameters and to validate atmospheric
        models. The present study will also help us to understand
        various processes, including dust formation and depletion of
        metals onto dust grains in M dwarf atmospheres. The high
        spectral resolution also provides a unique opportunity to
        constrain other chemical and physical processes that occur in a
        cool atmosphere. <BR /> Methods: The high-resolution APOGEE
        spectra of M dwarfs, covering the entire H-band, provide a
        unique opportunity to measure their fundamental parameters. We
        have performed a detailed spectral synthesis by comparing these
        high-resolution H-band spectra to that of the most recent BT-
        Settl model and have obtained fundamental parameters such as
        effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity
        (T$_{eff}$, log g, and [Fe/H]), respectively. <BR /> Results: We
        have determined T$_{eff}$, log g, and [Fe/H] for 45 M dwarfs
        using high-resolution H-band spectra. The derived T$_{eff}$ for
        the sample ranges from 3100 to 3900 K, values of log g lie in
        the range 4.5 {\ensuremath{\leq}} log g {\ensuremath{\leq}} 5.5,
        and the resulting metallicities lie in the range -0.5
        {\ensuremath{\leq}} [Fe/H] {\ensuremath{\leq}} +0.5. We have
        explored systematic differences between effective temperature
        and metallicity calibrations with other studies using the same
        sample of M dwarfs. We have also shown that the stellar
        parameters determined using the BT-Settl model are more accurate
        and reliable compared to other comparative studies using
        alternative models.}},

	Abstract = {{Context. M subdwarfs are metal-poor and cool stars. They are important
        probes of the old galactic populations. However, they remain
        elusive because of their low luminosity. Observational and
        modelling efforts are required to fully understand their physics
        and to investigate the effects of metallicity in their cool
        atmospheres. <BR /> Aims: We performed a detailed study of a
        sample of subdwarfs to determine their stellar parameters and
        constrain the state-of-the art atmospheric models. <BR />
        Methods: We present UVES/VLT high-resolution spectra of three
        late-K subdwarfs and 18 M subdwarfs. Our atlas covers the
        optical region from 6400 {\r{A}} to the near-infrared at 8900
        {\r{A}}. We show spectral details of cool atmospheres at very
        high-resolution (R \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 40 000) and
        compare them with synthetic spectra computed from the recent BT-
        Settl atmosphere models. <BR /> Results: Our comparison shows
        that molecular features (TiO, VO, CaH), and atomic features (Fe
        I, Ti I, Na I, K I) are well-fitted by current models. We
        produce a relation of effective temperature versus spectral type
        over the entire subdwarf spectral sequence. The high-resolution
        of our spectra unabled us to perform a detailed comparison of
        the line profiles of individual elements such as Fe I, Ca II,
        and Ti I, and we determined accurate metallicities of these
        stars. These determinations in turn enabled us to calibrate the
        relation between metallicity and molecular-band strength indices
        from low-resolution spectra. <BR /> Conclusions: The new
        generation of models is able to reproduce various spectral
        features of M subdwarfs. These high-resolution spectra allowed
        us to separate the atmospheric parameters (effective
        temperature, gravity, metallicity), which is not possible when
        using low-resolution spectroscopy or photometry. Based on
        observations made with the ESO Very Large Telescope at the

	Abstract = {{We explore the extent to which current titanium oxide (TiO) line data
        and M dwarf model atmospheres can be used to reproduce an R =
        120,000 optical spectrum of the relatively inactive star Gliese
        725B (M3.5 V). We find that tabulated TiO wavelengths have
        errors large enough to complicate line identification,
        especially for transitions involving higher vibrational states.
        We determine empirical wavelength corrections for 12 strong
        {\ensuremath{\gamma}}-bands near 6680 and 7090 {\r{A}}. For the
        sequence of orbital quantum numbers, J, within any one of these
        bands, our observations confirm the predicted line spacing,
        thereby validating the rotational constants for low vibrational
        levels. However, the predicted wavelengths have zero-point
        errors that differ for each overlapping band. Next, we compare
        observed and synthetic spectra near 8463 {\r{A}}, where an
        {\ensuremath{\varepsilon}} Q$_{3}$ 0-0 band head is expected,
        demonstrating that the electronic oscillator strength of 0.014
        advocated by J{\o}rgensen is too large by at least a factor of
        5. This has a minor effect on the structure of theoretical model
        atmospheres. Using our empirically corrected TiO wavelengths, we
        compute a grid of synthetic spectra for Allard \&amp; Hauschildt
        models spanning a range in effective temperature (T$_{eff}$),
        surface gravity (log g), and metallicity ([M/H]). Interpolating
        in this grid of synthetic spectra, we simultaneously fit
        observations of the TiO band head region near 7088 {\r{A}} and
        five Ti I and Fe I lines near 8683 {\r{A}}. For Gl 725B, we find
        T$_{eff}$ = 3170 +/- 71 K, log g = 4.77 +/- 0.14, [M/H] = -0.92
        +/- 0.07, and v$_{mac}$ = 1.1 +/- 0.7 km s$^{-1}$. We show that
        by using both atomic and molecular lines as constraints,
        systematic uncertainties in derived stellar parameters can be
        reduced. These parameters are consistent with published values
        obtained by other means, but more stringent tests would be
        useful. In the Appendix, we tabulate wavelengths,
        identifications, relative line strengths, and other properties
        of the strongest band heads in the {\ensuremath{\alpha}},
        {\ensuremath{\beta}}, {\ensuremath{\gamma}},

	Abstract = {{In the era of vast spectroscopic surveys focusing on Galactic stellar
        populations, astronomers want to exploit the large quantity and
        good quality of data to derive their atmospheric parameters
        without losing precision from automatic procedures. In this
        work, we developed a new spectral package, FASMA, to estimate
        the stellar atmospheric parameters (namely effective
        temperature, surface gravity and metallicity) in a fast and
        robust way. This method is suitable for spectra of FGK-type
        stars in medium and high resolution. The spectroscopic analysis
        is based on the spectral synthesis technique using the radiative
        transfer code, MOOG. The line list is comprised of mainly iron
        lines in the optical spectrum. The atomic data are calibrated
        after the Sun and Arcturus. We use two comparison samples to
        test our method, (i) a sample of 451 FGK-type dwarfs from the
        high-resolution HARPS spectrograph; and (ii) the Gaia-ESO
        benchmark stars using both high and medium resolution spectra.
        We explore biases in our method from the analysis of synthetic
        spectra covering the parameter space of our interest. We show
        that our spectral package is able to provide reliable results
        for a wide range of stellar parameters, different rotational
        velocities, different instrumental resolutions and for different
        spectral regions of the VLT-GIRAFFE spectrographs, used amongst
        others for the Gaia-ESO survey. FASMA estimates stellar
        parameters in less than 15 m for high-resolution and 3 m for
        medium-resolution spectra. The complete package is publicly
        available to the community.}},

        using the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory. Our procedure
        used a single line list to fit model spectra to observations of
        all stars to determine effective temperature, surface gravity,
        metallicity, projected rotational velocity, and the abundances
        of 15 elements (C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe,
        Ni, and Y). Sixty percent of the sample had Hipparcos parallaxes
        and V-band photometry, which we combined with the spectroscopic
        results to obtain mass, radius, and luminosity. Additionally, we
        used the luminosity, effective temperature, metallicity and
        {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-element enhancement to interpolate in the
        Yonsei-Yale isochrones to derive mass, radius, gravity, and age

        and 0.5 km s$^{-1}$ in v\textbackslashsin I based on multiple

        similarly precise, between ̃0.01 and ̃0.04 dex, though trends
        with respect to \{T\}$_{\{eff}$\} remained for which we derived
        empirical corrections. The trends, though small, were much
        larger than our uncertainties and are shared with published
        abundances. We show that changing our model atmosphere grid
        accounts for most of the trend in [M/H] between 5000 and 5500 K,
        indicating a possible problem with the atmosphere models or
        opacities.}},

        and K stars that have been observed by the Keck, Lick, and AAT
        planet search programs. Fitting observed echelle spectra with
        synthetic spectra yielded effective temperature, surface
        gravity, metallicity, projected rotational velocity, and
        abundances of the elements Na, Si, Ti, Fe, and Ni, for every
        star in the catalog. Combining V-band photometry and Hipparcos
        parallaxes with a bolometric correction based on the
        spectroscopic results yielded stellar luminosity, radius, and
        mass. Interpolating Yonsei-Yale isochrones to the luminosity,
        effective temperature, metallicity, and
        {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-element enhancement of each star yielded a
        theoretical mass, radius, gravity, and age range for most stars
        in the catalog. Automated tools provide uniform results and make
        analysis of such a large sample practical. Our analysis method
        differs from traditional abundance analyses in that we fit the
        observed spectrum directly, rather than trying to match
        equivalent widths, and we determine effective temperature and
        surface gravity from the spectrum itself, rather than adopting
        values based on measured photometry or parallax. As part of our
        analysis, we determined a new relationship between
        macroturbulence and effective temperature on the main sequence.
        Detailed error analysis revealed small systematic offsets with
        respect to the Sun and spurious abundance trends as a function
        of effective temperature that would be inobvious in smaller
        samples. We attempted to remove these errors by applying
        empirical corrections, achieving a precision per spectrum of 44
        K in effective temperature, 0.03 dex in metallicity, 0.06 dex in
        the logarithm of gravity, and 0.5 km s$^{-1}$ in projected
        rotational velocity. Comparisons with previous studies show only
        small discrepancies. Our spectroscopically determined masses
        have a median fractional precision of 15\%, but they are
        systematically 10\% higher than masses obtained by interpolating
        isochrones. Our spectroscopic radii have a median fractional
        precision of 3\%. Our ages from isochrones have a precision that
        varies dramatically with location in the Hertzsprung-Russell
        diagram. We plan to extend the catalog by applying our automated
        analysis technique to other large stellar samples.}},

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}
This article introduces \DF, a system that unifies the task of maintaining a variety of analytics over normalized data under updates. We show its applicability to learning linear regression models, building Chow Liu trees, and query evaluation with listing/factorized result representation. \DF recovers the best known complexities for free-connex acyclic and $q$-hierarchical queries. A prior version of this work~\cite{FIVM:SIGMOD:2018} also discusses the application of \DF to  matrix chain multiplication. These tasks use the same computation paradigm that factorizes the representation and the computation of the keys, the payloads, and the updates. Their differences are confined to the definition of the sum and product operations in a suitable ring. \DF is publicly available and was implemented as an extension of DBToaster~\cite{DBT:VLDBJ:2014}, a state-of-the-art system for incremental maintenance, and shown to outperform competitors by orders of magnitude in both time and space. 

Going forward, we would like to apply this approach to further tasks such as inference in probabilistic graphical models and more complex machine learning tasks.

\DF inherits the limitations of DBToaster, in particular it is single-threaded. A promising avenue of research is to build \DF on top of an open-source parallel and distributed framework such as Apache Flink. Another goal is to extend \DF to support further SQL operators such as theta joins, nested subqueries, and NULLs, which are relevant in practice.

\section{Complexity Analysis}

Consider a query $Q$ over a database $\db$, a set of updatable relations $\mathcal{U}$, and a view tree $\tau$ that corresponds to the query $Q$. 
We analyze the time complexity of processing single-tuple updates to each relation in $\mathcal{U}$ and the space complexity of the materialized views in $\tau$.

    "abstract": "The effects of dark matter spike in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole, located at the center of M87 (the Virgo A galaxy), are investigated within the framework of the so-called Bumblebee Gravity. Our primary aim is to determine whether the background of spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking has a significant effect on the horizon, ergo-region, and shadow of the Kerr Bumblebee black hole in the spike region. For this purpose, we first incorporate the dark matter distribution in a Lorentz-violating spherically symmetric space-time as a component of the energy-momentum tensors in the Einstein field equations. This leads to a space-time metric for a Schwarzschild Bumblebee black hole with a dark matter distribution in the spike region and beyond. Subsequently, this solution is generalized to a Kerr Bumblebee black hole through the use of the Newman-Janis-Azreg-Aïnou algorithm. Then, according to the available observational data for the dark matter spike density and radius, and the Schwarzschild radius of the supermassive black hole in Virgo A galaxy, we examine the shapes of shadow and demonstrate the influence of the spin parameter $a$, the Lorentz-violating parameter $\\ell$ and the corresponding dark matter halo parameters $ρ_{0}$ and $r_{0}$ on the deformation and size of the shadow.",

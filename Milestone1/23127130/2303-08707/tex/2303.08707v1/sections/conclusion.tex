\section{Conclusion}\label{sec_conc}
In this work, we provided explicit formulas for inputs that guarantee PE for linear and classes of nonlinear systems (Hammerstein and SISO flat systems). For nonlinear systems which are locally reachable at the origin, we showed existence of sparse inputs which guarantee collective PE of input- and state-dependent basis functions. These results are crucial for the application of recent data-driven control schemes that require such PE conditions to be satisfied.

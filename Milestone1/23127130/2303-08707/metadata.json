    "abstract": "In the context of data-driven control, persistence of excitation (PE) of an input sequence is defined in terms of a rank condition on the Hankel matrix of the input data. For nonlinear systems, recent results employed rank conditions involving collected input and state/output data, for which no guidelines are available on how to satisfy them a priori. In this paper, we first show that a set of discrete impulses is guaranteed to be persistently exciting for any controllable LTI system. Based on this result, for certain classes of nonlinear systems, we guarantee persistence of excitation of a sequence of basis functions a priori, by design of the physical input only. Finally, for nonlinear systems which are locally reachable at the origin, we show that there exist sparse input sequences that guarantee collective PE of sequences of basis functions.",

    "abstract": "By considering a particular type of invariant Seifert surfaces we define a homomorphism $Φ$ from the equivariant concordance group of directed strongly invertible knots $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{C}}$ to a new equivariant algebraic concordance group $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{G}}^{\\mathbb{Z}}$. We prove that $Φ$ lifts both Miller and Powell's equivariant algebraic concordance homomorphism and Alfieri and Boyle's equivariant signature. Moreover, we provide a partial result on the isomorphism type of $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{G}}^{\\mathbb{Z}}$ and we obtain a new obstruction to equivariant sliceness, which can be viewed as an equivariant Fox-Milnor condition. We define new equivariant signatures and using these we obtain novel lower bounds on the equivariant slice genus. Finally, we show that $Φ$ is invariant under topological equivariant concordance and that can obstruct equivariant sliceness for knots with Alexander polynomial one.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies a delegation problem faced by the planner who wants to regulate receivers' reaction choices in markets for matching between receivers and senders with signaling. We provide a noble insight into the planner's willingness to delegate and the design of optimal (reaction) interval delegation as a solution to the planner's general mechanism design problem. The relative heterogeneity of receiver types and the productivity of the sender' signal are crucial in deriving optimal interval delegation in the presence of the trade-off between matching efficiency and signaling costs.",

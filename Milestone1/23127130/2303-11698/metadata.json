    "abstract": "Label distribution (LD) uses the description degree to describe instances, which provides more fine-grained supervision information when learning with label ambiguity. Nevertheless, LD is unavailable in many real-world applications. To obtain LD, label enhancement (LE) has emerged to recover LD from logical label. Existing LE approach have the following problems: (\\textbf{i}) They use logical label to train mappings to LD, but the supervision information is too loose, which can lead to inaccurate model prediction; (\\textbf{ii}) They ignore feature redundancy and use the collected features directly. To solve (\\textbf{i}), we use the topology of the feature space to generate more accurate label-confidence. To solve (\\textbf{ii}), we proposed a novel supervised LE dimensionality reduction approach, which projects the original data into a lower dimensional feature space. Combining the above two, we obtain the augmented data for LE. Further, we proposed a novel nonlinear LE model based on the label-confidence and reduced features. Extensive experiments on 12 real-world datasets are conducted and the results show that our method consistently outperforms the other five comparing approaches.",

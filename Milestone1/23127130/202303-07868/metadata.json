    "abstract": "The representative instance segmentation methods mostly segment different\nobject instances with a mask of the fixed resolution, e.g., 28*28 grid.\nHowever, a low-resolution mask loses rich details, while a high-resolution mask\nincurs quadratic computation overhead. It is a challenging task to predict the\noptimal binary mask for each instance. In this paper, we propose to dynamically\nselect suitable masks for different object proposals. First, a dual-level\nFeature Pyramid Network (FPN) with adaptive feature aggregation is developed to\ngradually increase the mask grid resolution, ensuring high-quality segmentation\nof objects. Specifically, an efficient region-level top-down path (r-FPN) is\nintroduced to incorporate complementary contextual and detailed information\nfrom different stages of image-level FPN (i-FPN). Then, to alleviate the\nincrease of computation and memory costs caused by using large masks, we\ndevelop a Mask Switch Module (MSM) with negligible computational cost to select\nthe most suitable mask resolution for each instance, achieving high efficiency\nwhile maintaining high segmentation accuracy. Without bells and whistles, the\nproposed method, namely DynaMask, brings consistent and noticeable performance\nimprovements over other state-of-the-arts at a moderate computation overhead.\nThe source code: https://github.com/lslrh/DynaMask.",

    "abstract": "An averaging operator on an associative algebra $A$ is an algebraic abstraction of the time average operator on the space of real-valued functions defined in time-space. In this paper, we consider relative averaging operators on a bimodule $M$ over an associative algebra $A$. A relative averaging operator induces a diassociative algebra structure on the space $M$. The full data consisting of an associative algebra, a bimodule and a relative averaging operator is called a relative averaging algebra. We define bimodules over a relative averaging algebra that fits with the representations of diassociative algebras. We construct a graded Lie algebra and a $L_\\infty$-algebra that are respectively controlling algebraic structures for a given relative averaging operator and relative averaging algebra. We also define cohomologies of relative averaging operators and relative averaging algebras and find a long exact sequence connecting various cohomology groups. As applications, we study deformations and abelian extensions of relative averaging algebras. Finally, we define homotopy relative averaging algebras and show that they induce homotopy diassociative algebras.",

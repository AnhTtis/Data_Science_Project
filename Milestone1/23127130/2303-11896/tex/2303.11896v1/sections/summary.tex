This paper has the following structure: 
Section \ref{sec:preliminaries} reviews the notations, the peak-minimizing control framework of \cite{molina2022equivalent}, and \ac{SOS} methods. Section \ref{sec:crash_lp} formulates an infinite-dimensional \ac{LP} to solve \eqref{eq:crash_traj}. Section \ref{sec:crash_robust} applies the crash-safety framework towards $L_\infty$-penalized data-driven analysis using robust Lie counterparts from 
 \cite{miller2023robustcounterpart}. Section \ref{sec:crash_sos} forms \ac{SOS} programs for crash-safety and tabulates their computational complexity. 
Section \ref{sec:crash_subvalue} evaluates the safety of points inside $X$ by a subvalue function of the crash-safety cost. 
 Section \ref{sec:crash_examples} provides demonstrations of crash-safety. 
 Section \ref{sec:conclusion} concludes the paper.
% Section \ref{sec:preliminaries} will review preliminaries such as notation, notions of stability for linear systems, and \ac{SOS} proofs of polynomial nonnegativity. Section \ref{sec:full_method} will present 
% The paper is concluded in Section \ref{sec:conclusion}.

Contributions of this work include,
\begin{itemize}
    \item An interpretation of peak-minimal control costs as a quantification of safety
    \item An infinite-dimensional \ac{LP} that produces the peak-minimal cost under compactness, regularity, and convexity conditions
    \item A subvalue functional that lower-bounds the crash-safety effort
    \item An application of crash-safety towards data-driven safety analysis
\end{itemize}

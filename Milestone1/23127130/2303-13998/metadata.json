    "abstract": "We develop an asymptotic approximation and bounds for the traveling salesman problem with time slots, i.e. when the time windows of points to visit are a partition of a given time horizon. Although this problem is relevant in several delivery applications, operational research researchers did not pay close attention to it, contrary to the extensively studied general formulation with time windows. Exploiting the specificity of this problem allows to solve more efficiently instances which may be hard to solve by specifically designed algorithms for the traveling salesman problem with time windows. The asymptotic analysis of the traveling salesman problem with time slots is a step toward developing new approximations for the general problem with time windows.We discuss this case. We equally provide a formulation of the asymptotic approximation under a worst-case demand distribution of the points to visit, based on the principle of the maximum entropy. Computational results are given for the benchmarks of the literature for which the time slots are randomly generated.",

    "abstract": "Laser radiation incident on a ferromagnetic sample produces excited electrons and currents whose spin polarization must not be aligned with the magnetization -- an effect due to spin-orbit coupling that is ubiquitous in spin- and angle-resolved photoemission. In this Paper, we report on a systematic investigation of the dynamics of spin polarization and spin-polarized currents produced by femtosecond laser pulses, modeled within our theoretical framework EVOLVE. The spin polarization depends strongly on the properties of the laser pulse and on the sample composition, as is shown by comparing results for Cu(100), Co(100), and a Co/Cu heterostructure. We find a transition from coherence before the laser pulse's maximum to incoherence thereafter. Moreover, the time dependence of the spin-polarization components induced by spin-orbit coupling differ significantly in Cu and Co: in Cu, we find long-period oscillations with tiny rapid modulations, whereas in Co prominent rapid oscillations with long period ones are superimposed. The pronounced spatial dependencies of the signals underline the importance of inhomogeneities, in particular magnetic/non-magnetic interfaces `act as source' for ultrafast spin-polarization effects. Our investigation provides detailed insight into electron dynamics during and shortly after a femtosecond laser excitation.",

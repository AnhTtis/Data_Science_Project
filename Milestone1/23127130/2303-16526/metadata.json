    "abstract": "Patch-to-point matching has become a robust way of point cloud registration. However, previous patch-matching methods employ superpoints with poor localization precision as nodes, which may lead to ambiguous patch partitions. In this paper, we propose a HybridPoint-based network to find more robust and accurate correspondences. Firstly, we propose to use salient points with prominent local features as nodes to increase patch repeatability, and introduce some uniformly distributed points to complete the point cloud, thus constituting hybrid points. Hybrid points not only have better localization precision but also give a complete picture of the whole point cloud. Furthermore, based on the characteristic of hybrid points, we propose a dual-classes patch matching module, which leverages the matching results of salient points and filters the matching noise of non-salient points. Experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3DMatch, 3DLoMatch, and KITTI odometry, especially with 93.0% Registration Recall on the 3DMatch dataset.

    "abstract": "We present a machine learning method to estimate the physical parameters of classical pulsating stars such as RR Lyrae and Cepheid variables based on an automated comparison of their theoretical and observed light curve parameters at multiple wavelengths. We train artificial neural networks (ANNs) on theoretical pulsation models to predict the fundamental parameters (mass, radius, luminosity, and effective temperature) of Cepheid and RR Lyrae stars based on their period and light curve parameters. The fundamental parameters of these stars can be estimated up to 60 percent more accurately when the light curve parameters are taken into consideration. This method was applied to the observations of hundreds of Cepheids and thousands of RR Lyrae in the Magellanic Clouds to produce catalogs of estimated masses, radii, luminosities, and other parameters of these stars.",

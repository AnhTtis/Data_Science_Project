    "abstract": "Today's quantum computers are primarily accessible through the cloud and potentially shifting to the edge network in the future. With the rapid advancement and proliferation of quantum computing research worldwide, there has been a considerable increase in demand for using cloud-based quantum computation resources. This demand has highlighted the need for designing efficient and adaptable resource management strategies and service models for quantum computing. However, the limited quantity, quality, and accessibility of quantum resources pose significant challenges to practical research in quantum software and systems. To address these challenges, we propose iQuantum, a first-of-its-kind simulation toolkit that can model hybrid quantum-classical computing environments for prototyping and evaluating system design and scheduling algorithms. This paper presents the quantum computing system model, architectural design, proof-of-concept implementation, potential use cases, and future development of iQuantum. Our proposed iQuantum simulator is anticipated to boost research in quantum software and systems, particularly in the creation and evaluation of policies and algorithms for resource management, job scheduling, and hybrid quantum-classical task orchestration in quantum computing environments integrating edge and cloud resources.",

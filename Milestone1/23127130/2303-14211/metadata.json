    "abstract": "Mixtures of shifted asymmetric Laplace distributions were introduced as a tool for model-based clustering that allowed for the direct parameterization of skewness in addition to location and scale. Following common practices, an expectation-maximization algorithm was developed to fit these mixtures. However, adaptations to account for the `infinite likelihood problem' led to fits that gave good classification performance at the expense of parameter recovery. In this paper, we propose a more valuable solution to this problem by developing a novel Bayesian parameter estimation scheme for mixtures of shifted asymmetric Laplace distributions. Through simulation studies, we show that the proposed parameter estimation scheme gives better parameter estimates compared to the expectation-maximization based scheme. In addition, we also show that the classification performance is as good, and in some cases better, than the expectation-maximization based scheme. The performance of both schemes are also assessed using well-known real data sets.",

    abstract={The expectation?maximization (EM) algorithm is a common approach for parameter estimation in the context of cluster analysis using finite mixture models. This approach suffers from the well-known issue of convergence to local maxima, but also the less obvious problem of overfitting. These combined, and competing, concerns are illustrated through simulation and then addressed by introducing an algorithm that augments the traditional EM with the nonparametric bootstrap. Further simulations and applications to real data lend support for the usage of this bootstrap augmented EM-style algorithm to avoid both overfitting and local maxima.},

    abstract = {Summary An expanded family of mixtures of multivariate power exponential distributions is introduced. While fitting heavy-tails and skewness have received much attention in the model-based clustering literature recently, we investigate the use of a distribution that can deal with both varying tail-weight and peakedness of data. A family of parsimonious models is proposed using an eigen-decomposition of the scale matrix. A generalized expectation?maximization algorithm is presented that combines convex optimization via a minorization?maximization approach and optimization based on accelerated line search algorithms on the Stiefel manifold. Lastly, the utility of this family of models is illustrated using both toy and benchmark data.},

The originality comes from introducing multidimensional instead of univariate scale variables for the mixture of scaled Gaussian family of distributions. In contrast to most existing approaches, the derived distributions can account for a variety of shapes and have a simple tractable form with a closed-form probability density function whatever the dimension. We examine a number of properties of these distributions and illustrate them in the particular case of Pearson type VII and ttails. For these latter cases, we provide maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters and illustrate their modelling flexibility on simulated and real data clustering example.}},

	Abstract = {Abstract Mixture models whose components have skewed hypercube contours are developed via a generalization of the multivariate shifted asymmetric Laplace density. Specifically, we develop mixtures of multiple scaled shifted asymmetric Laplace distributions. The component densities have a unique combination of features: they include a multivariate weight function and the marginal distributions are asymmetric Laplace. We use these mixtures of multiple scaled shifted asymmetric Laplace distributions for clustering applications, but they could be used in the supervised or semi-supervised paradigms. Parameter estimates are obtained via an expectation-maximization algorithm and the Bayesian information criterion is used for model selection. Simulated and real data sets are utilized to illustrate the approach and, in some cases, to visualize the skewed hypercube structure of the components. },

    abstract="The problem of merging Gaussian mixture components is discussed in situations where a Gaussian mixture is fitted but the mixture components are not separated enough from each other to interpret them as ``clusters''. The problem of merging Gaussian mixtures is not statistically identifiable, therefore merging algorithms have to be based on subjective cluster concepts. Cluster concepts based on unimodality and misclassification probabilities (``patterns'') are distinguished. Several different hierarchical merging methods are proposed for different cluster concepts, based on the ridgeline analysis of modality of Gaussian mixtures, the dip test, the Bhattacharyya dissimilarity, a direct estimator of misclassification and the strength of predicting pairwise cluster memberships. The methods are compared by a simulation study and application to two real datasets. A new visualisation method of the separation of Gaussian mixture components, the ordered posterior plot, is also introduced.",

    abstract="Deep learning is a hierarchical inference method formed by subsequent multiple layers of learning able to more efficiently describe complex relationships. In this work, deep Gaussian mixture models (DGMM) are introduced and discussed. A DGMM is a network of multiple layers of latent variables, where, at each layer, the variables follow a mixture of Gaussian distributions. Thus, the deep mixture model consists of a set of nested mixtures of linear models, which globally provide a nonlinear model able to describe the data in a very flexible way. In order to avoid overparameterized solutions, dimension reduction by factor models can be applied at each layer of the architecture, thus resulting in deep mixtures of factor analyzers.",

Parameter estimation for these mixtures is carried out via an alternating expectation-conditional maximization algorithm, and relies on convenient expressions for expected values for the generalized inverse Gaussian distribution. The Bayesian information criterion is used to select the number of latent factors. The mixture of variance-gamma factor analyzers model is illustrated on a well-known breast cancer data set. Finally, the place of variance-gamma mixtures within the growing body of literature on non-Gaussian mixtures is considered.",

    abstract = "Clustering procedures suitable for the analysis of very high-dimensional data are needed for many modern data sets. One approach, called high-dimensional data clustering (HDDC), uses a family of Gaussian mixture models for clustering. HDDC is based on the idea that high-dimensional data usually exists in lower-dimensional subspaces; as such, an intrinsic dimension for each sub-population of the observed data can be estimated and cluster analysis can be performed in this lower-dimensional subspace. As a result, only a fraction of the total number of parameters needs to be estimated. This family of models has gained attention due to its superior classification performance compared to other families of mixture models; however, it still suffers from the usual limitations of Gaussian mixture model-based approaches, e.g., these models are sensitive to outlying or spurious points. In this paper, a robust analog of the HDDC approach is proposed. This approach, which extends the HDDC procedure to the multivariate-t distribution, encompasses 28 models that rectify the aforementioned shortcoming of the HDDC procedure. Our tHDDC procedure is compared to the HDDC procedure using both simulated and real data sets, which includes an image reconstruction problem that arose from satellite imagery of the surface of Mars."

    abstract="The Gaussian cluster-weighted model (CWM) is a mixture of regression models with random covariates that allows for flexible clustering of a random vector composed of response variables and covariates. In each mixture component, a Gaussian distribution is adopted for both the covariates and the responses given the covariates. To make the approach robust with respect to the presence of mildly atypical observations, the contaminated Gaussian CWM is introduced. In addition to the parameters of the Gaussian CWM, each mixture component has a parameter controlling the proportion of outliers, one controlling the proportion of leverage points, one specifying the degree of contamination with respect to the response variables, and another specifying the degree of contamination with respect to the covariates. Crucially, these parameters do not have to be specified a priori, adding flexibility to the approach. Furthermore, once the model is estimated and the observations are assigned to the components, a finer intra-group classification in typical points, (mild) outliers, good leverage points, and bad leverage points---concepts of primary importance in robust regression analysis---can be directly obtained. Relations with other mixture-based contaminated models are analyzed, identifiability conditions are provided, an expectation-conditional maximization algorithm is outlined for parameter estimation, and various implementation and operational issues are discussed. Properties of the estimators of the regression coefficients are evaluated through Monte Carlo experiments and compared with other procedures. A sensitivity study is also conducted based on a real data set.",

A sample from the full joint distribution of all unknown variables is thereby generated, and this can be used as a basis for a thorough presentation of many aspects of the posterior distribution. The methodology is applied here to the analysis of univariate normal mixtures, using a hierarchical prior model that offers an approach to dealing with weak prior information while avoiding the mathematical pitfalls of using improper priors in the mixture context.},

    abstract = {In a Bayesian analysis of finite mixture models, parameter estimation and clustering are sometimes less straightforward than might be expected. In particular, the common practice of estimating parameters by their posterior mean, and summarizing joint posterior distributions by marginal distributions, often leads to nonsensical answers. This is due to the so-called ‘label switching’ problem, which is caused by symmetry in the likelihood of the model parameters. A frequent response to this problem is to remove the symmetry by using artificial identifiability constraints. We demonstrate that this fails in general to solve the problem, and we describe an alternative class of approaches, relabelling algorithms, which arise from attempting to minimize the posterior expected loss under a class of loss functions. We describe in detail one particularly simple and general relabelling algorithm and illustrate its success in dealing with the label switching problem on two examples.},

    abstract="Traditionally, there are three species of classification: unsupervised, supervised, and semi-supervised. Supervised and semi-supervised classification differ by whether or not weight is given to unlabelled observations in the classification procedure. In unsupervised classification, or clustering, all observations are unlabeled and hence full weight is given to unlabelled observations. When some observations are unlabelled, it can be very difficult to a priori choose the optimal level of supervision, and the consequences of a sub-optimal choice can be non-trivial. A flexible fractionally-supervised approach to classification is introduced, where any level of supervision---ranging from unsupervised to supervised---can be attained. Our approach uses a weighted likelihood, wherein weights control the relative role that labelled and unlabelled data have in building a classifier. A comparison between our approach and the traditional species is presented using simulated and real data. Gaussian mixture models are used as a vehicle to illustrate our fractionally-supervised classification approach; however, it is broadly applicable and variations on the postulated model can be easily made.",

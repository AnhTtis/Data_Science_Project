We present a compositional assume-guarantee reasoning framework to provide a purely relational mathematical semantics for discrete-time Simulink diagrams, and then to verify the diagrams against the contracts in the same semantics in UTP. We define semantics for individual blocks and composition operators, and develop a set of calculation laws (based on the equational theory) to facilitate automated proof. An industrial safety-critical model is verified using our approach. Furthermore, all these definitions, laws, and verification of the case study are mechanised in Isabelle/UTP, an implementation of UTP in Isabelle/HOL.},

  abstract = {RoboChart is a timed domain-specific language for robotics, distinctive in its support for automated verification by model checking and theorem proving. Since uncertainty is an essential part of robotic systems, we present here an extension to RoboChart to model uncertainty using probabilism. The extension enriches RoboChart state machines with probability through a new construct: probabilistic junctions as the source of transitions with a probability value. RoboChart has an accompanying tool, called RoboTool, for modelling and verification of functional and real-time behaviour. We present here also an automatic technique, implemented in RoboTool, to transform a RoboChart model into a PRISM model for verification. We have extended the property language of RoboTool so that probabilistic properties expressed in temporal logic can be written using controlled natural language.},

  abstract   = {Interaction trees (ITrees) are a general-purpose data structure for representing the
behaviors of recursive programs that interact with their environments. A coinductive
variant of ?free monads,? ITrees are built out of uninterpreted events and their continuations.
They support compositional construction of interpreters from event handlers, which
give meaning to events by defining their semantics as monadic actions. ITrees are
expressive enough to represent impure and potentially nonterminating, mutually recursive
computations, while admitting a rich equational theory of equivalence up to weak bisimulation.
In contrast to other approaches such as relationally specified operational semantics,
ITrees are executable via code extraction, making them suitable for debugging, testing,
and implementing software artifacts that are amenable to formal verification. We have
implemented ITrees and their associated theory as a Coq library, mechanizing classic
domain- and category-theoretic results about program semantics, iteration, monadic
structures, and equational reasoning. Although the internals of the library rely heavily
on coinductive proofs, the interface hides these details so that clients can use and
reason about ITrees without explicit use of Coq?s coinduction tactics. To showcase
the utility of our theory, we prove the termination-sensitive correctness of a compiler
from a simple imperative source language to an assembly-like target whose meanings
are given in an ITree-based denotational semantics. Unlike previous results using
operational techniques, our bisimulation proof follows straightforwardly by structural
induction and elementary rewriting via an equational theory of combinators for control-flow
graphs.},

Often, state machines are drawn to convey overall ideas and used as a basis to program tool-specific simulations. The simulation code, written in general or proprietary programming languages, is, however, the only full account of the robotic system. Here, we present the RoboStar technology, a modern approach to design that supports automatic generation of simulation code guaranteed to be correct with respect to a design model, and complements simulation with model checking, theorem proving, and automatic test generation for simulation. Diagrammatic domain-specific, but tool-independent, notations for design and simulation use state machines, differential equations, and controlled English to specify behavior. We illustrate the RoboStar approach using an autonomous vehicle as an example.},

  abstract  = {Semantics for nondeterministic probabilistic sequential programs has been well studied in the past decades. In a variety of semantic models, how nondeterministic choice interacts with probabilistic choice is the most significant difference. In He, Morgan, and McIver's relational model, probabilistic choice refines nondeterministic choice. This model is general because of its predicative-style semantics in Hoare and He's Unifying Theories of Programming, and suitable for automated reasoning because of its algebraic feature. Previously, we gave probabilistic semantics to the RoboChart notation based on this model, and also formalised the proof that the semantic embedding is a homomorphism, and revealed interesting details. In this paper, we present our mechanisation of the proof in Isabelle/UTP enabling automated reasoning for probabilistic sequential programs including a subset of the RoboChart language. With mechanisation, we even reveal more interesting questions, hidden in the original model. We demonstrate several examples, including an example to illustrate the interaction between nondeterministic choice and probabilistic choice, and a RoboChart model for randomisation based on binary probabilistic choice.},

  abstract  = {We outline a probabilistic denotational semantics for the RoboChart language, a diagrammatic, domain-specific notation for describing robotic controllers with their hardware platforms and operating environments. We do this using a powerful (but perhaps not so well known) semantic technique: He, Morgan, and McIver's weakest completion semantics, which is based on Hoare and He's Unifying Theories of Programming. In this approach, we do the following: (1) start with the standard semantics for a nondeterministic programming language; (2) propose a new probabilistic semantic domain; (3) propose a forgetful function from the probabilistic semantic domain to the standard semantic domain; (4) use the converse of the forgetful function to embed the standard semantic domain in the probabilistic semantic domain; (5) demonstrate that this embedding preserves program structure; (6) define the probabilistic choice operator. Weakest completion semantics guides the semantic definition of new languages by building on existing semantics and, in this case, tackling a notoriously thorny issue: the relationship between demonic and probabilistic choice. Consistency ensures that programming intuitions, development techniques, and proof methods can be carried over from the standard language to the probabilistic one. We largely follow He et al., our contribution being an explication of the technique with meticulous proofs suitable for mechanisation in Isabelle/UTP.},

RoboChart supports shared variables and communication across entities in its component model. It has a formal denotational semantics given in CSP. Interaction Trees (ITrees) is a semantic technique to represent behaviours of reactive and concurrent programs interacting with their environments. Recent mechanisations of ITrees along with ITree-based CSP semantics and a Z mathematical toolkit in Isabelle/HOL bring new applications of verification and animation for state-rich process languages, such as RoboChart. In this paper, we use ITrees to give RoboChart a novel operational semantics, implement it in Isabelle, and use Isabelle's code generator to generate verified and executable animations. We illustrate our approach using an autonomous chemical detector model. With animation, we show two concrete scenarios when the robot encounters different environmental inputs.},

    "abstract": "The experimental results of 252 magnetic rotational bands reported in 123 nuclei and 38 antimagnetic rotational bands reported in 27 nuclei are collected and listed in the present work, including energy, spin, parity, magnetic dipole reduced transition probability B(M1), electric quadrupole reduced transition probability B(E2), B(M1)/B(E2) ratio, and the ratio of the dynamic moment of inertia to the electric quadrupole reduced transition probability J(2)/B(E2). Following the presentation of the kinematic moment of inertia J(1), dynamic moment of inertia J(2), and I versus rotational frequency, as well as energy staggering parameter S(I), B(M1), B(E2), B(M1)/B(E2), and J(2)/B(E2) versus I in A 60, 80, 110, 140, and 190 mass regions, a brief discussion is provided. Based on the systematic studies, some nuclei are predicted to be candidates for magnetic or antimagnetic rotation.",

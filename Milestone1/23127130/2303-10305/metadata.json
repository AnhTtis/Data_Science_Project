    "abstract": "In the context of bottom-up holography, we demonstrate the power of mixed boundary conditions to promote the boundary gauge field to be dynamical. We provide two concrete applications of this idea. First, we consider a holographic dual for a strongly coupled plasma described by dissipative magnetohydrodynamics. Second, we reveal the expected features of the Higgs mechanism in a not counterfeit holographic superconductor.",

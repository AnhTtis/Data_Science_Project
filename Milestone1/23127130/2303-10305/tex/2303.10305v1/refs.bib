@article{doi:10.1146/annurev-conmatphys-031214-014350,
	Abstract = { The order parameter and its variations in space and time in many different states in condensed matter physics at low temperatures are described by the complex function Ψ(r, t). These states include superfluids, superconductors, and a subclass of antiferromagnets and charge density waves. The collective fluctuations in the ordered state may then be categorized as oscillations of phase and amplitude of Ψ(r, t). The phase oscillations are the Goldstone modes of the broken continuous symmetry. The amplitude modes, even at long wavelengths, are well defined and are decoupled from the phase oscillations only near particle-hole symmetry, where the equations of motion have an effective Lorentz symmetry, as in particle physics and if there are no significant avenues for decay into other excitations. They bear close correspondence with the so-called Higgs modes in particle physics, whose prediction and discovery are very important for the standard model of particle physics. In this review, we discuss the theory and the possible observation of the amplitude or Higgs modes in condensed matter physics---in superconductors, cold atoms in periodic lattices, and uniaxial antiferromagnets. We discuss the necessity for at least approximate particle-hole symmetry as well as the special conditions required to couple to such modes because, being scalars, they do not couple linearly to the usual condensed matter probes. },

@article{doi:10.1146/annurev-conmatphys-031119-050813,
	Abstract = { When the continuous symmetry of a physical system is spontaneously broken, two types of collective modes typically emerge: the amplitude and the phase modes of the order-parameter fluctuation. For superconductors, the amplitude mode is referred to most recently as the Higgs mode as it is a condensed-matter analog of a Higgs boson in particle physics. Higgs mode is a scalar excitation of the order parameter, distinct from charge or spin fluctuations, and thus does not couple to electromagnetic fields linearly. This is why the Higgs mode in superconductors has evaded experimental observations for over a half century after the initial theoretical prediction, except for a charge-density-wave coexisting system. With the advance of nonlinear and time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy techniques, however, it has become possible to study the Higgs mode through the nonlinear light--Higgs coupling. In this review, we overview recent progress in the study of the Higgs mode in superconductors. },

	Abstract = {We formulate the gauge invariant Lorentz covariant Ginzburg--Landau theory which describes nonstationary regimes: relaxation of a superconducting system accompanied by eigen oscillations of internal degrees of freedom (Higgs mode and Goldstone mode) and also forced oscillations under the action of an external gauge field. The theory describes Lorentz covariant electrodynamics of superconductors where Anderson--Higgs mechanism occurs, at the same time the dynamics of conduction electrons remains non-relativistic. It is demonstrated that Goldstone oscillations cannot be accompanied by oscillations of charge density and they generate the transverse field only. In addition, we consider Goldstone modes and features of Anderson--Higgs mechanism in two-band superconductors. We study dissipative processes, which are caused by movement of the normal component of electron liquid and violate the Lorentz covariance, on the examples of the damped oscillations of the order parameter and the skin-effect for electromagnetic waves. An experimental consequence of the extended time-dependent Ginzburg--Landau theory regarding the penetration of the electromagnetic field into a superconductor is proposed.},

@article{Krull2016,
	Abstract = {In equilibrium systems amplitude and phase collective modes are decoupled, as they are mutually orthogonal excitations. The direct detection of these Higgs and Leggett collective modes by linear-response measurements is not possible, because they do not couple directly to the electromagnetic field. In this work, using numerical exact simulations we show for the case of two-gap superconductors, that optical pump--probe experiments excite both Higgs and Leggett modes out of equilibrium. We find that this non-adiabatic excitation process introduces a strong interaction between the collective modes, which is absent in equilibrium. Moreover, we propose a type of pump--probe experiment, which allows to probe and coherently control the Higgs and Leggett modes, and thus the order parameter directly. These findings go beyond two-band superconductors and apply to general collective modes in quantum materials.},

	Abstract = {{It is shown that in a clean two-band (transition-metal) superconductor there appears a collective excitation corresponding to small fluctuations of the relative phase of the two ``condensates''. In contrast to the transverse collective excitations in ordinary superconductors, the energy of this mode can be derived directly from existing experimental data; for Nb it lies about at the middle of the smaller single-particle gap. Direct experimental detection of this resonance is estimated to be rather beyond the limits of available techniques, but its effect on the ultrasound dispersion curve should be easily observable. The phenomenon is used to elucidate the physical nature of excitons in superconductors in general.}},

@article{Sherman2015,
	Abstract = {The concept of mass generation by means of the Higgs mechanism was strongly inspired by earlier works on the Meissner--Ochsenfeld effect in superconductors. In quantum field theory, the excitations of longitudinal components of the Higgs field manifest as massive Higgs bosons. The analogous Higgs mode in superconductors has not yet been observed owing to its rapid decay into particle--hole pairs. According to recent theories, however, the Higgs mode should decrease below the superconducting pairing gap 2$\Delta$ and become visible in two-dimensional systems close to the superconductor--insulator transition. For experimental verification, we measured the complex terahertz transmission and tunnelling density of states of various thin films of superconducting NbN and InO close to criticality. Comparing both techniques reveals a growing discrepancy between the finite 2$\Delta$ and the threshold energy for electromagnetic absorption, which vanishes critically towards the superconductor--insulator transition. We identify the excess absorption below 2$\Delta$ as strong evidence of the Higgs mode in two-dimensional quantum critical superconductors.},

	Abstract = {We have addressed problems associated with the measurement of zero-field-cooled (ZFC) magnetization and its interpretation in the light of negative magnetization reported in certain ferrimagnetic materials such as CoCr2O4. We demonstrate that a small negative trapped field in the sample space as well as large coercive fields are responsible for the observed negative magnetization. The problem is commonly encountered while working with magnetometers and a superconducting magnet where the sign of the trapped field can be positive or negative depending on the way the field is reduced to zero.},

@article{ZAKERI201447,
	Abstract = {Elementary spin excitations (magnons) play a fundamental role in condensed matter physics, since many phenomena e.g. magnetic ordering, electrical (as well as heat) transport properties, ultrafast magnetization processes, and most importantly electron/spin dynamics can only be understood when these quasi-particles are taken into consideration. In addition to their fundamental importance, magnons may also be used for information processing in modern spintronics. Here the concept of spin excitations in ultrathin itinerant magnets is discussed and reviewed. Starting with a historical introduction, different classes of magnons are introduced. Different theoretical treatments of spin excitations in solids are outlined. Interaction of spin-polarized electrons with a magnetic surface is discussed. It is shown that, based on the quantum mechanical conservation rules, a magnon can only be excited when a minority electron is injected into the system. While the magnon creation process is forbidden by majority electrons, the magnon annihilation process is allowed instead. These fundamental quantum mechanical selection rules, together with the strong interaction of electrons with matter, make the spin-polarized electron spectroscopies as appropriate tools to excite and probe the elementary spin excitations in low-dimensional magnets e.g ultrathin films and nanostructures. The focus is put on the experimental results obtained by spin-polarized electron energy loss spectroscopy and spin-polarized inelastic tunneling spectroscopy. The magnon dispersion relation, lifetime, group and phase velocity measured using these approaches in various ultrathin magnets are discussed in detail. The differences and similarities with respect to the bulk excitations are addressed. The role of the temperature, atomic structure, number of atomic layers, lattice strain, electronic complexes and hybridization at the interfaces are outlined. A possibility of simultaneous probing of magnons and phonons in complex low-dimensional ferromagnetic oxide nanostructures is discussed. The influence of the relativistic spin--orbit coupling on high-energy magnons is addressed. It is shown how the spin--orbit coupling breaks the energy degeneracy of the magnons excited in an ultrathin ferromagnet, and how it influences their lifetime, amplitude, group and phase velocity. A potential application of these new effects in modern spintronics is outlined. It is illustrated how one can take advantage of collective nature of magnons and use these quasi-particles for probing the magnetic exchange interaction at buried interfaces.},

	Abstract = {Determining the quantum circuit complexity of a unitary operation is closely related to the problem of finding minimal length paths in a particular curved geometry [Nielsen et al, Science 311, 1133-1135 (2006)]. This paper investigates many of the basic geometric objects associated to this space, including the Levi-Civita connection, the geodesic equation, the curvature, and the Jacobi equation. We show that the optimal Hamiltonian evolution for synthesis of a desired unitary necessarily obeys a simple universal geodesic equation. As a consequence, once the initial value of the Hamiltonian is set, subsequent changes to the Hamiltonian are completely determined by the geodesic equation. We develop many analytic solutions to the geodesic equation, and a set of invariants that completely determine the geodesics. We investigate the problem of finding minimal geodesics through a desired unitary, U, and develop a procedure which allows us to deform the (known) geodesics of a simple and well understood metric to the geodesics of the metric of interest in quantum computation. This deformation procedure is illustrated using some three-qubit numerical examples. We study the computational complexity of evaluating distances on Riemmanian manifolds, and show that no efficient classical algorithm for this problem exists, subject to the assumption that good pseudorandom generators exist. Finally, we develop a canonical extension procedure for unitary operations which allows ancilla qubits to be incorporated into the geometric approach to quantum computing.},

@article{Nielsen:aa,
	Abstract = {What is the minimal size quantum circuit required to exactly implement a specified n-qubit unitary operation, U, without the use of ancilla qubits? We show that a lower bound on the minimal size is provided by the length of the minimal geodesic between U and the identity, I, where length is defined by a suitable Finsler metric on SU(2^n). The geodesic curves of such a metric have the striking property that once an initial position and velocity are set, the remainder of the geodesic is completely determined by a second order differential equation known as the geodesic equation. This is in contrast with the usual case in circuit design, either classical or quantum, where being given part of an optimal circuit does not obviously assist in the design of the rest of the circuit. Geodesic analysis thus offers a potentially powerful approach to the problem of proving quantum circuit lower bounds. In this paper we construct several Finsler metrics whose minimal length geodesics provide lower bounds on quantum circuit size, and give a procedure to compute the corresponding geodesic equation. We also construct a large class of solutions to the geodesic equation, which we call Pauli geodesics, since they arise from isometries generated by the Pauli group. For any unitary U diagonal in the computational basis, we show that: (a) provided the minimal length geodesic is unique, it must be a Pauli geodesic; (b) finding the length of the minimal Pauli geodesic passing from I to U is equivalent to solving an exponential size instance of the closest vector in a lattice problem (CVP); and (c) all but a doubly exponentially small fraction of such unitaries have minimal Pauli geodesics of exponential length.},

	Abstract = {The stability properties of Einstein theory with a cosmological constant Λ are investigated. For Λ &gt; 0, stability is established for small fluctuations, about the de Sitter background, occurring inside the event horizon and semiclassical stability is analyzed. For Λ &lt; 0, stability is demonstrated for all asymptotically anti-de Sitter metrics. The analysis is based on the general construction of conserved flux-integral expressions associated with the symmetries of a chosen background. The effects of an event horizon, which lead to Hawking radiation, are expressedfor general field hamiltonians. Stability for Λ &lt; 0 is proved, using supergravity techniques, in terms of the graded anti-de Sitter algebra with spinorial charges also expressed as flux integrals.},

	Abstract = {We propose a procedure for computing the boundary stress tensor associated with a gravitating system in asymptotically anti-de Sitter space. Our definition is free of ambiguities encountered by previous attempts, and correctly reproduces the masses and angular momenta of various spacetimes. Via the AdS/CFT correspondence, our classical result is interpretable as the expectation value of the stress tensor in a quantum conformal field theory. We demonstrate that the conformal anomalies in two and four dimensions are recovered. The two dimensional stress tensor transforms with a Schwarzian derivative and the expected central charge. We also find a nonzero ground state energy for global AdS5, and show that it exactly matches the Casimir energy of the dual super Yang--Mills theory on S3{\texttimes}R.},

@article{Chapman2018,
	Abstract = {We examine holographic complexity in time-dependent Vaidya spacetimes with both the complexity=volume (CV) and complexity=action (CA) proposals. We focus on the evolution of the holographic complexity for a thin shell of null fluid, which collapses into empty AdS space and forms a (one-sided) black hole. In order to apply the CA approach, we introduce an action principle for the null fluid which sources the Vaidya geometries, and we carefully examine the contribution of the null shell to the action. Further, we find that adding a particular counterterm on the null boundaries of the Wheeler-DeWitt patch is essential if the gravitational action is to properly describe the complexity of the boundary state. For both the CV proposal and the CA proposal (with the extra boundary counterterm), the late time limit of the growth rate of the holographic complexity for the one-sided black hole is precisely the same as that found for an eternal black hole.},

	Abstract = {Constraint satisfaction problems are a central pillar of modern computational complexity theory. This survey provides an introduction to the rapidly growing field of Quantum Hamiltonian Complexity, which includes the study of quantum constraint satisfaction problems. Over the past decade and a half, this field has witnessed fundamental breakthroughs, ranging from the establishment of a "Quantum Cook-Levin Theorem" to deep insights into the structure of 1D low-temperature quantum systems via so-called area laws. Our aim here is to provide a computer science-oriented introduction to the subject in order to help bridge the language barrier between computer scientists and physicists in the field. As such, we include the following in this survey: (1) The motivations and history of the field, (2) a glossary of condensed matter physics terms explained in computer-science friendly language, (3) overviews of central ideas from condensed matter physics, such as indistinguishable particles, mean field theory, tensor networks, and area laws, and (4) brief expositions of selected computer science-based results in the area. For example, as part of the latter, we provide a novel information theoretic presentation of Bravyi's polynomial time algorithm for Quantum 2-SAT.

The emphasis will be on elucidating the relation between evolution of quantum field theories perturbed away from equilibrium and the dual picture of dynamics of classical fields in black hole backgrounds. In particular, we discuss the linear response regime, the hydrodynamic regime and finally the non-linear regime of interacting quantum systems. We also describe how the duality might be used to learn some salient aspects of black hole physics in terms of field theory observables.},

	Abstract = {We study momentum relaxation due to dilute, weak impurities in a strongly coupled CFT, a truncation of the M2 brane theory. Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we compute the relaxation time scale as a function of the background magnetic field B and charge density \rho. The theory admits two different types of impurities. We find that for magnetic impurities, momentum relaxation due to the impurity is suppressed by a background B or \rho. For electric impurities, due to an underlying instability in the theory towards an ordered phase, the inverse relaxation time scale increases dramatically near \sqrt{B^2 + \rho^2/\sigma^2_0} \sim 21 T^2. We compute the Nernst response for the impure theory, and comment on similarities with recent measurements in superconductors.},

We examine a theory of $N$ species of fermions at non-zero density coupled to a $U(1)$ gauge field in two spatial dimensions, and determine the Lyapunov rate and the butterfly velocity in an extended random-phase approximation. The thermal diffusivity is found to be universally related to these chaos parameters i.e. the relationship is independent of $N$, the gauge coupling constant, the Fermi velocity, the Fermi surface curvature, and high energy details.},

	Abstract = {Recent work has studied the growth of commutators as a probe of chaos and information scrambling in quantum many-body systems. In this work we study the effect of static disorder on the growth of commutators in a variety of contexts. We find generically that disorder slows the onset of scrambling, and, in the case of a many-body localized state, partially halts it. We access the many-body localized state using a standard fixed point Hamiltonian, and we show that operators exhibit slow logarithmic growth under time evolution. We compare the result with the expected growth of commutators in both localized and delocalized non-interacting disordered models. Finally, based on a scaling argument, we state a conjecture about the effect of weak interactions on the growth of commutators in an interacting diffusive metal.},

@article{Aleiner:2016aa,
	Abstract = {We extend the Keldysh technique to enable the computation of out-of-time order correlators. We show that the behavior of these correlators is described by equations that display initially an exponential instability which is followed by a linear propagation of the decoherence between two initially identically copies of the quantum many body systems with interactions. At large times the decoherence propagation (quantum butterfly effect) is described by a diffusion equation with non-linear dissipation known in the theory of combustion waves. The solution of this equation is a propagating non-linear wave moving with constant velocity despite the diffusive character of the underlying dynamics. Our general conclusions are illustrated by the detailed computations for the specific models describing the electrons interacting with bosonic degrees of freedom (phonons, two-level-systems etc.) or with each other.},

@article{Bruin804,
	Abstract = {Many exotic compounds, such as cuprate superconductors and heavy fermion materials, exhibit a linear in temperature (T) resistivity, the origin of which is not well understood. We found that the resistivity of the quantum critical metal Sr3Ru2O7 is also T-linear at the critical magnetic field of 7.9 T. Using the precise existing data for the Fermi surface topography and quasiparticle velocities of Sr3Ru2O7, we show that in the region of the T-linear resistivity, the scattering rate per kelvin is well approximated by the ratio of the Boltzmann constant to the Planck constant divided by 2π. Extending the analysis to a number of other materials reveals similar results in the T-linear region, in spite of large differences in the microscopic origins of the scattering.},

abstract = {This paper presents an introduction to phase transitions and critical phenomena on the one hand, and nonequilibrium patterns on the other, using the Ginzburg–Landau theory as a unified language. In the first part, mean-field theory is presented, for both statics and dynamics, and its validity tested self-consistently. As is well known, the mean-field approximation breaks down below four spatial dimensions, where it can be replaced by a scaling phenomenology. The Ginzburg–Landau formalism can then be used to justify the phenomenological theory using the renormalization group, which elucidates the physical and mathematical mechanism for universality. In the second part of the paper it is shown how near pattern forming linear instabilities of dynamical systems, a formally similar Ginzburg–Landau theory can be derived for nonequilibrium macroscopic phenomena. The real and complex Ginzburg–Landau equations thus obtained yield nontrivial solutions of the original dynamical system, valid near the linear instability. Examples of such solutions are plane waves, defects such as dislocations or spirals, and states of temporal or spatiotemporal (extensive) chaos.}

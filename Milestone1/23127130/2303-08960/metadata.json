    "abstract": "In a given geometry, the kinematics of a congruence of curves is described by a set of three quantities called expansion, rotation, and shear. The equations governing the evolution of these quantities are referred to as kinematic equations. In this paper, the kinematics of congruence of curves in a metric-affine geometry are analysed. Without assuming an underlying theory of gravity, we derive a generalised form of the evolution equations for expansion, namely, Raychaudhuri equation (timelike congruences) and Sachs optical equation (null congruences). The evolution equations for rotation and shear of both timelike and null congruences are also derived. Generalising the deviation equation, we find that torsion and non-metricity contribute to a relative acceleration between neighbouring curves. We briefly discuss the interpretation of the expansion scalars and derive an equation governing angular diameter distances. The effects of torsion and non-metricity on the distances are found to be dependent on whether the photon trajectories are autoparallels or geodesics. We also show that the rotation of a hypersurface orthogonal congruence (timelike or null) is a purely non-Riemannian feature.",

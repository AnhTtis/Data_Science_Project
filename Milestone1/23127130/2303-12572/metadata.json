    "abstract": "GINGER (Gyroscopes IN GEneral Relativity), based on an array of large dimension ring laser gyroscopes, is aiming at measuring in the Gran Sasso underground laboratory the Earth angular velocity with unprecedented sensitivity in order to record the general relativity effects on top of the Earth crust; 1 part $10^9$ of the Earth surface is the goal to access the signals expected by general relativity, due to deSitter and Lense-Thirring effects, this target is also valuable for Lorentz Violation in the gravity sector. GINGER is an multi-disciplinar project. Being attached to the Earth crust, it will provide useful data for geophysical investigation, and it will be one of the instruments in the recently proposed multi-components geophysical observatory of GranSasso. It is expected that the realisation of GINGER will take 18 months, and 3 years will take to reach the relative sensitivity of 1 part in $10^{11}$.",

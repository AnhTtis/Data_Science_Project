    "abstract": "In this paper, we prove that if two finite groups G and H have isomorphic Burnside rings, then G and H are the same order type groups, and give an example to show that the Burnside rings of the same order type groups are not necessarily isomorphic. This result is related to the Thompson Problem which was raised in 1987.",

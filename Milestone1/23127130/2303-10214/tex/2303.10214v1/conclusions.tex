\section{Conclusions}

We study the problem of detecting social bots in online social network platforms, inspired by novel account behavioral features mining and characterizing on a real-world dataset collected from \Twitter. We present \BotShape, an intelligent social bots detection framework consisting of three processes: account event logs pre-processing, behavioral sequences and patterns mining, and accurate bot prediction.
We target discovering novel but compelling fine-grain behavioral features which have never been systemically studied and evaluated by previous works. \BotShape first automatically generates behavior sequences, which are time series of statistics of different time-window, to profile various periods in one account's life-cycle. Based on apparent similarities of the characteristics and fluctuations of behavioral sequences after analyzing and clustering, our system second compresses raw sequences from high-dimensionality vector to low-dimensionality but more effective time series patterns based on the Shapelet algorithm. \BotShape was evaluated as generally accurate on three ground truths and four classification algorithms. Also, behavioral patterns as features also show an outstanding performance than \emph{account-based} features and raw behavioral sequences produced by the first process.

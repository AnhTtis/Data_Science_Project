    "abstract": "We obtain a Lagrangian for a lightlike dimensional reduction of the nonabelian M5 brane theory in six dimension. We assume that the six-manifold has at least one conformal Killing spinor and two commuting lightlike Killing vector fields, and we perform the dimensional reduction along one of these lightlike directions.",

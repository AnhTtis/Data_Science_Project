    "abstract": "TypeScript is a quickly evolving superset of JavaScript with active development of new features. Our paper seeks to understand how quickly these features are adopted by the developer community. Existing work in JavaScript shows the adoption of dynamic language features can be a major hindrance to static analysis. As TypeScript evolves the addition of features makes the underlying standard more and more difficult to keep up with. In our work we present an analysis of 454 open source TypeScript repositories and study the adoption of 13 language features over the past three years. We show that while new versions of the TypeScript compiler are aggressively adopted by the community, the same cannot be said for language features. While some experience strong growth others are rarely adopted by projects. Our work serves as a starting point for future study of the adoption of features in TypeScript. We also release our analysis and data gathering software as open source in the hope it helps the programming languages community.",

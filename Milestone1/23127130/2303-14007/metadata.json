    "abstract": "Oversight is rightly recognised as vital within high-stakes public sector AI applications, where decisions can have profound individual and collective impacts. Much current thinking regarding forms of oversight mechanisms for AI within the public sector revolves around the idea of human decision makers being 'in-the-loop' and thus being able to intervene to prevent errors and potential harm. However, in a number of high-stakes public sector contexts, operational oversight of decisions is made by expert teams rather than individuals. The ways in which deployed AI systems can be integrated into these existing operational team oversight processes has yet to attract much attention. We address this gap by exploring the impacts of AI upon pre-existing oversight of clinical decision-making through institutional analysis. We find that existing oversight is nested within professional training requirements and relies heavily upon explanation and questioning to elicit vital information. Professional bodies and liability mechanisms also act as additional levers of oversight. These dimensions of oversight are impacted, and potentially reconfigured, by AI systems. We therefore suggest a broader lens of 'team-in-the-loop' to conceptualise the system-level analysis required for adoption of AI within high-stakes public sector deployment.",

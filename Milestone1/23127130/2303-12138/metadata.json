    "abstract": "The study of knot mosaics is based upon representing knot diagrams using a set of tiles on a square grid. This branch of knot theory has many unanswered questions, especially regarding the efficiency with which we draw knots as mosaics. While any knot or link can be displayed as a mosaic, for most of them it is still unknown what size of mosaic (mosaic number) is necessary and how many non-blank tiles (tile number) are necessary to depict a given knot or link. We implement an algorithmic programming approach to find the mosaic number and tile number of all prime knots with crossing number 10 or less. We also introduce an online repository which includes a table of knot mosaics and a tool that allows users can create and identify their own knot mosaics.",

    \caption{An overview of the ReNeuS framework. The scene is separated into two sub-spaces \wrt the interface. 
    The internal scene is represented by two multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for both geometry and appearance. 
    For neural rendering, we recursively trace a ray through the scene and collect a list of sub-rays. 
    Our neural implicit representation makes the tracing process controllable. 
    We show a ray tracing process with the depth of recursion $D_{re} = 3$ here. 
    Color accumulation is conducted on irradiance of the sub-rays in the inverse direction of ray tracing. 
    We optimized the network by the difference between rendered image and the ground truth image. 
    Target mesh can be extracted from SDF by Marching Cubes \cite{lorensen1987MarchingCubesHigha}}.

    "abstract": "SrVO3 (SVO) is a prospective candidate to replace the conventional indium-tin-oxide (ITO) among the new transparent conducting oxide (TCO) generation. In this study, the structural, electrical, and optical properties of SVO thin films, both epitaxial and polycrystalline, are determined during and after heat treatments in the 150-250 °C range and under ambient environment in order to explore the chemical stability of this material. The use of these relatively low temperatures speeds up the natural ageing of the films, and allows to follow the evolution of their related properties. The combination of techniques rather sensitive to the film surface and of techniques sampling the film volume will emphasize the presence of a surface oxidation evolving in time at low annealing temperatures, whereas the perovskite phase is destroyed throughout the film for treatments above 200 °C. The present study is designed to understand the thermal degradation and long-term stability issues of vanadate-based TCOs, and to identify technologically viable solutions for the application of this group as new TCOs.",

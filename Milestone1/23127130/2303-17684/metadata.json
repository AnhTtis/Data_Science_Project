    "abstract": "Modern computing and communication technologies such as supercomputers and the internet are based on optically connected networks of microwave frequency information processors. In recent years, an analogous architecture has emerged for quantum networks with optically distributed entanglement between remote superconducting quantum processors, a leading platform for quantum computing. Here we report an important milestone towards such networks by observing non-classical correlations between photons in an optical link and a superconducting electrical circuit. We generate such states of light through a spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) process in a chip-scale piezo-optomechanical transducer. The non-classical nature of the emitted light is verified by observing anti-bunching in the microwave state conditioned on detection of an optical photon. Such a transducer can be readily connected to a superconducting quantum processor, and serve as a key building block for optical quantum networks of microwave frequency qubits.",

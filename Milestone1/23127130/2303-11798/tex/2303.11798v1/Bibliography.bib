abstract = {In the 1950's interest arose in the science-fiction idea of “antigravity”. This concept was a speculation that matter and antimatter would repel each other in ordinary tensor (Einsteinian) gravity. (This was reminiscent of the Coulomb interaction between like charges.) Three types of arguments were raised to disprove “antigravity”: (i) violation of conservation of energy, (ii) violation of the principle of equivalence, (iii) anomalous regeneration of Ks mesons, all of which were unseen. Unfortunately, in the physics folklore these arguments came to be interpreted as ruling out any difference in the gravitational interaction of matter and antimatter to the earth, not just ruling out this “antigravity.” After reviewing the history behind the concept of antigravity, we discuss modern theoretical ideas and experiments which are relevant to the possibility that there exist static, non-Newtonian components of gravity. We then consider the arguments against antigravity, pointing out their regimes of applicability and inapplicability to modern quantum theories of gravity. We specifically show that, if these arguments are applied to the ongoing experiment to measure the gravitational acceleration of the antiproton, they do not rule out a large anomalous gravitational response for the antiproton. The antiproton gravity experiment is one of five types of experiments that we consider to be the most critical in testing for finite but long-range, non-Newtonian and non-Einsteinian gravity. We discuss how all five are related to each other and how their completion would improve our knowledge of gravitational forces.}

This hypothesis has withstood experimental tests to an impressive accuracy of one part in one hundred billion. Various hypotheses based on theory and observations with matter suggest violations of WEP for antimatter may exist anywhere from the one part per million to the 200\% level. An observed violation at any level would have a profound impact, e.g. it would offer an explanation of why matter and antimatter are so distinctly separated in the Cosmos. We propose a precise test of WEP for antiprotons in microgravity. We expect to test WEP for antimatter to about one part per million, and foresee that additional advancements of several orders of magnitude in precision could follow with further technical developments.}

Following Price, we show that, very surprisingly, the usual expression of the Equivalence Principle is violated by General Relativity when particles of negative mass are supposed to exist, which may provide a fundamental explanation of MOND phenomenology, obviating the need for Dark Matter. Motivated by the observation of repulsive gravity under the form of Dark Energy, and by the fact that our universe looks very similar to a coasting (neither decelerating nor accelerating) universe, we study the Dirac-Milne cosmology, a symmetric matter-antimatter cosmology where antiparticles have the same gravitational properties as holes in a semiconductor. Noting the similarities with our universe (age, SN1a luminosity distance, nucleosynthesis, CMB angular scale), we focus our attention on structure formation mechanisms, finding strong similarities with our universe. Additional tests of the Dirac-Milne cosmology are briefly reviewed, and we finally note that a crucial test of the Dirac-Milne cosmology will be soon realized at CERN next to the ELENA antiproton decelerator, possibly as early as fall 2018, with the AEgIS, ALPHA-g and Gbar antihydrogen gravity experiments.},

abstract={In this work, we discuss the possibility of inertial sensing with positronium in the 23S metastable state for the measurement of optical dipole, relativistic and gravitational forces on a purely leptonic matter-antimatter system. Starting from the characteristics of an available 23S beam, we estimate the time necessary to measure accelerations ranging from {\textasciitilde}105 m/s2 to 9.1 m/s2 with two different inertial sensitive devices: a classical moir{\'e} deflectometer and a Mach--Zehnder interferometer. The sensitivity of the Mach--Zehnder interferometer has been estimated to be several tens of times better than that of the moir{\'e} deflectometer, for the same measurement time. Different strategies to strengthen the 23S beam flux and to improve the sensitivity of the devices are proposed and analyzed. Among them, the most promising are reducing the divergence of the positronium beam through 2D laser Doppler cooling and coherent positronium {Raman} excitation from the ground state to the 23S level. If implemented, these improvements promise to result in the time required to measure an acceleration of 9.1 m/s2 of few weeks and 100 m/s2 of a few hours. Different detection schemes for resolving the fringe pattern shift generated on 23S positronium crossing the deflectometer/interferometer are also discussed.},

After reviewing the current available sources of Ps, we consider laser cooling as a route to push the precision in the measurement down to 0.1 ppb.

abstract={Physicists have long wondered whether the gravitational interactions between matter and antimatter might be different from those between matter and itself. Although there are many indirect indications that no such differences exist and that the weak equivalence principle holds, there have been no direct, free-fall style, experimental tests of gravity on antimatter. Here we describe a novel direct test methodology; we search for a propensity for antihydrogen atoms to fall downward when released from the ALPHA antihydrogen trap. In the absence of systematic errors, we can reject ratios of the gravitational to inertial mass of antihydrogen >75 at a statistical significance level of 5{\%}; worst-case systematic errors increase the minimum rejection ratio to 110. A similar search places somewhat tighter bounds on a negative gravitational mass, that is, on antigravity. This methodology, coupled with ongoing experimental improvements, should allow us to bound the ratio within the more interesting near equivalence regime.},

abstract = {The fine-structure constant, α, is a dimensionless constant that characterizes the strength of the electromagnetic interaction between charged elementary particles. Related by four fundamental constants, a precise determination of α allows for a test of the Standard Model of particle physics. Parker et al. used matter-wave interferometry with a cloud of cesium atoms to make the most accurate measurement of α to date. Determining the value of α to an accuracy of better than 1 part per billion provides an independent method for testing the accuracy of quantum electrodynamics and the Standard Model. It may also enable searches of the so-called “dark sector” for explanations of dark matter. Science, this issue p. 191 Atom interferometry provides a precise measurement of the fine-structure constant. Measurements of the fine-structure constant α require methods from across subfields and are thus powerful tests of the consistency of theory and experiment in physics. Using the recoil frequency of cesium-133 atoms in a matter-wave interferometer, we recorded the most accurate measurement of the fine-structure constant to date: α = 1/137.035999046(27) at 2.0 × 10−10 accuracy. Using multiphoton interactions (Bragg diffraction and Bloch oscillations), we demonstrate the largest phase (12 million radians) of any Ramsey-Bordé interferometer and control systematic effects at a level of 0.12 part per billion. Comparison with Penning trap measurements of the electron gyromagnetic anomaly ge − 2 via the Standard Model of particle physics is now limited by the uncertainty in ge − 2; a 2.5σ tension rejects dark photons as the reason for the unexplained part of the muon’s magnetic moment at a 99\% confidence level. Implications for dark-sector candidates and electron substructure may be a sign of physics beyond the Standard Model that warrants further investigation.}}

This interdisciplinary experiment, called Atomic Experiment for Dark Matter and Gravity Exploration (AEDGE), will also complement other planned searches for dark matter, and exploit synergies with other gravitational wave detectors. We give examples of the extended range of sensitivity to ultra-light dark matter offered by AEDGE, and how its gravitational-wave measurements could explore the assembly of super-massive black holes, first-order phase transitions in the early universe and cosmic strings. AEDGE will be based upon technologies now being developed for terrestrial experiments using cold atoms, and will benefit from the space experience obtained with, e.g., LISA and cold atom experiments in microgravity.},

In this scheme, only one arm and one laser will be used for operating the two atom interferometers. We consider atoms in the atom interferometers not only as perfect inertial reference sensors, but also as highly stable clocks. Atomic coherence is intrinsically stable and can be many orders of magnitude more stable than a laser. The unique one-laser configuration allows us to then apply time-delay interferometry to the responses of the two atom interferometers, thereby canceling the laser phase fluctuations while preserving the gravitational wave signal in the resulting data set. Our approach appears very promising. We plan to investigate further its practicality and detailed sensitivity analysis.},

ZAIGA will be equipped with long-baseline atom interferometers, high-precision atom clocks, and large-scale gyros. ZAIGA facility will take an equilateral triangle configuration with two 1-km-apart atom interferometers in each arm, a 300-m vertical tunnel with atom fountain and atom clocks mounted, and a tracking-and-ranging 1-km-arm-length prototype with lattice optical clocks linked by locked lasers.

This type of detector is based on a consolidated   technology and its efficiency has been demonstrated for nuclear   radiation and particles in many experiments. This work also presents   the detection efficiency as a function of the positron kinetic   energy in the range from 50 eV to 17 keV, essential for a complete   characterization of the particle beam. The method allows the   characterization of a positron beam in real time with a spatial   resolution of the order of tens of microns.}

journal = {New Journal of Physics},
abstract = {The cross sections for the photodetachment from a weakly bound positronium negative ion Ps- below the threshold for the formation of Ps(n = 4) are calculated using the hyperspherical close-coupling method, and are compared with the corresponding spectra for the H- ion. Detailed resonance structures in the spectra near the Ps(n = 2, 3 and 4) thresholds are reported for the first time. The off-resonance cross section below the Ps(n = 2) threshold differs appreciably from that obtained by a variational calculation (Ward et al  1987 J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Phys. 20 127), but agrees well with the recent close-coupling calculations with a B-spline expansion (Igarashi et al  2000 Phys. Rev.  A 61 032 710). The resonance energies and widths of the 1Po symmetry are generally in good agreement with the results of the complex-coordinate rotation calculation.}

abstract={When an electron binds to its anti-matter counterpart, the positron, it forms the exotic atom positronium (Ps). Ps can further bind to another electron to form the positronium negative ion, Ps− (e−e+e−). Since its constituents are solely point-like particles with the same mass, this system provides an excellent testing ground for the three-body problem in quantum mechanics. While theoretical works on its energy level and dynamics have been performed extensively, experimental investigations of its characteristics have been hampered by the weak ion yield and short annihilation lifetime. Here we report on the laser spectroscopy study of Ps−, using a source of efficiently produced ions, generated from the bombardment of slow positrons onto a Na-coated W surface. A strong shape resonance of 1Po symmetry has been observed near the Ps (n=2) formation threshold. The resonance energy and width measured are in good agreement with the result of three-body calculations.},

abstract={The Einstein equivalence principle (EEP) has a central role in the understanding of gravity and space--time. In its weak form, or weak equivalence principle (WEP), it directly implies equivalence between inertial and gravitational mass. Verifying this principle in a regime where the relevant properties of the test body must be described by quantum theory has profound implications. Here we report on a novel WEP test for atoms: a Bragg atom interferometer in a gravity gradiometer configuration compares the free fall of rubidium atoms prepared in two hyperfine states and in their coherent superposition. The use of the superposition state allows testing genuine quantum aspects of EEP with no classical analogue, which have remained completely unexplored so far. In addition, we measure the E{\"o}tv{\"o}s ratio of atoms in two hyperfine levels with relative uncertainty in the low 10−9, improving previous results by almost two orders of magnitude.},

The tuneability is achieved by varying the diameter of the aperture and thus requires no realignment of the cavity. We demonstrate this principle using a digital laser with an intra-cavity spatial light modulator, and confirm the predicted properties of the resonator experimentally.}

@UNPUBLISHED{NOTA,
note={We can define the spatial extension of the Ps wave function in the laser beams propagation direction as $\Delta y_{\rm Ps}=\hbar/\Delta p$ and $\Delta p=2m_\rme\Delta v_y=2m_\rme v_ztg(\Delta\theta_y)$, where m$_\rme$ is the mass of the electron, v$_{\rm z}$ is the Ps velocity in the direction of propagation assumed constant and $\theta y$ is the Ps entrance angle between the directions z and y. We can assume a collimation that sets $\Delta\theta y=1$ mrad, which gives $\Delta y_{\rm Ps}\simeq$ 10 nm. The minimum spatial separation between the centres of two wave functions that propagate in the interferometer is $\Delta y_{\rm min}=\frac{2\Delta z\hbar k^2}{v_z2m_e}\simeq$ 0.38$\mu$m with the distance $\Delta z$ between two laser beams equal to 4 mm. Given that $\Delta y_{\rm Ps}<\Delta y_{\rm min}$ we can consider that two wave functions overlap only when their trajectories intersect at a laser pulse.}

The first experiments with mesoporous materials highlighted in this review show very promising and exciting results. Mesoporous materials such as mesoporous silicon{,} mesoporous material films{,} pellets of MCM-41 and silica aerogel show remarkable features for antihydrogen formation. Yet{,} the characteristics for the best future mesoporous materials (e.g. pore sizes{,} pore connectivity{,} shape{,} surface chemistry) remain to be clearly identified. For now among the best candidates are pellets of MCM-41 and aerogel with pore sizes between 10 and 30 nm{,} possessing hydrophobic patches on their surface to avoid ice formation at low temperature. From a fundamental standpoint{,} antimatter experiments could help to shed light on open issues{,} such as the apparent asymmetry between matter and antimatter in our universe and the gravitational behaviour of antimatter. To this purpose{,} basic studies on antimatter are necessary and a convenient production of antimatter is required. It is exactly where mesoporous materials could be very useful.}}

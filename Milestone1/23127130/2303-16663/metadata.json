    "abstract": "The effects of the frequency-modulated pump on stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) in a flowing plasma are investigated by theory analysis, three-wave simulations, one-dimensional Vlasov-Maxwell simulations, and particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. The resonance points of SBS oscillate in a certain spatial region as time when frequency modulations are applied. There exists a certain frequency modulation that makes the velocity of resonant points close to the group velocity of seed laser, which increases the SBS reflectivity. And the SBS could be suppressed by frequency modulation with larger bandwidth. In the Vlasov-Maxwell simulations, the muti-locations autoresonance is observed in narrow bandwidth frequency modulation case, which can also increase the SBS reflectivity. Finally, one-dimensional PIC simulations confirm our conclusions and the movement of resonant points by autoresonance is consistent with our theoretical predications.",

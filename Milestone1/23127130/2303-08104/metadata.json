    "abstract": "We present the first fully differential predictions for tau neutrino scattering in the energy region relevant to the DUNE experiment, including all spin correlations and all tau lepton decay channels. The calculation is performed using a generic interface between the neutrino event generator Achilles and the publicly available, general-purpose collider event simulation framework Sherpa.",

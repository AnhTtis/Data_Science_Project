    "abstract": "After the loss of control authority over thrusters of the Nauka module, the International Space Station lost attitude control for 45 minutes with potentially disastrous consequences. Motivated by a scenario of orbital inspection, we consider a similar malfunction occurring to the inspector satellite and investigate whether its mission can still be safely fulfilled. While a natural approach is to counteract in real-time the uncontrolled and undesirable thrust with the remaining controlled thrusters, vehicles are often subject to actuation delays hindering this approach. Instead, we extend resilience theory to systems suffering from actuation delay and build a resilient trajectory tracking controller with stability guarantees relying on a state predictor. We demonstrate that this controller can track accurately the reference trajectory of the inspection mission despite the actuation delay and the loss of control authority over one of the thrusters.",

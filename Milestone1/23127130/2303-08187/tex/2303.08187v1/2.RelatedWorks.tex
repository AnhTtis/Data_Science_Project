The dominant approach to solving engineering problems are model-driven, like model-based design\cite{neema2019web}, model-based control\cite{brosilow2002techniques}, and model-based optimization\cite{vardhan2019modeling,neema2019design} etc. With the discovery of data-driven models especially deep neural networks the domain of model-based engineering is revolutionizing.  In recent times these data-driven models have been used and have worked well in image classification (AlexNet\cite{krizhevsky2017imagenet} ), engineering design\cite{vardhan2022data,moosavi2020role,vardhan2023search,volk2020biosystems}, autonomous driving car\cite{bojarski2016end,badue2021self,ni2020survey,shalev2017formal}, radiology \cite{gross1990neural}, human genome\cite{sundaram2018predicting}, and many more for developing state of the art control\cite{vardhan2022reduced,wu2019machine,tahsien2020machine} and prediction systems\cite{vardhan2022deep}. 


According to research\cite{momtaz2018rate}, self-driving cars could potentially save up to $35,000$ lives annually in the United States alone by reducing traffic deaths by up to $99$ percent.
$93$ percent of car accidents are the result of driver mistake, according to information from 2007 US report\cite{facts2007us}, and rookie drivers—who seldom have more than $30$ hours of driving experience before receiving a license—are over-represented in fatal car accidents.
Moreover, crashes among senior drivers rise at the same time because they have a diminished capacity to assess their surroundings for unforeseen dangers, according to \cite{momtaz2018rate}.
Self-driving cars will have been trained using machine learning data-sets made up of a wide range of driving circumstances and driver behaviors for the equivalent of hundreds of hours behind the wheel before they hit the roads\cite{bojarski2016end}. The practical utility of AI-ML model is enormous \cite{vardhan2023fusion,dreossi2019verifai,vardhan2023constrained,vaishya2020artificial} and a better understanding and insight about the model's performance would be useful for practical control designer. Since Deep learning is a data hungry model, it is not possible to generate an enormous amount of data for each application. In such cases, this DNN models fail to perform and alternative learning model can be useful.

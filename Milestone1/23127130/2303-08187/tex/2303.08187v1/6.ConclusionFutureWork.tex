\subsection{Conclusion}
 In this work, we attempted to design a controller for the lateral control of a vehicle using AI-ML models. Experiments' results show that:
 \begin{enumerate}
     \item  Random forest-based controller has better generalization capability than Deep neural network when limited data is available.
     \item Trained on one track and deployed on another track, the RF-based controller was able to complete the track without crashing, while the deep neural network-based controller  could not complete even 10\% of the track before crashing.
     \item Due to an ensemble of trees in RF, it is possible to quantify uncertainty and can help to decide the failure probability of the controller and take command of control if needed.  
 \end{enumerate}

\subsection{Future Work}
Our experiments are use cases to understand deeper about two prominently used AI models when used in the context of control. For future work, we want to extend this work by replacing the deep neural network with a Bayesian neural network that has better generalization capability and can predict confidence in prediction and evaluate its performance.

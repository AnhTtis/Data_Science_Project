\section{Discussion}
This paper presents a novel unsupervised anomaly segmentation framework, called \textit{PHANES}. It possesses the ability to reverse anomalies in medical images by preserving healthy tissues and substituting anomalous regions with pseudo-healthy reconstructions. By generating pseudo-healthy versions of images containing anomalies, \textit{PHANES} can be a useful tool in supporting clinical studies. In this work, we demonstrated exceptional performance in reversing synthetic anomalies and segmenting stroke lesions on brain T1w MRIs. We believe that deliberate masking of (possible) abnormal regions will pave new ways for novel anomaly segmentation methods and empower further clinical applications.

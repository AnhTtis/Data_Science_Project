    "abstract": "In this note we observe that membership in moment cones of spaces of quiver representations can be decided in strongly polynomial time, for any acyclic quiver. This generalizes a recent result by Chindris-Collins-Kline for bipartite quivers. Their approach was to construct \"multiplicity polytopes\" with a geometric realization similar to the Knutson-Tao polytopes for tensor product multiplicities. Here we show that a less geometric but straightforward variant of their construction leads to such a multiplicity polytope for any acyclic quiver. Tardos' strongly polynomial time algorithm for combinatorial linear programming along with the saturation property then implies that moment cone membership can be decided in strongly polynomial time. The analogous question for semi-invariants remains open.",

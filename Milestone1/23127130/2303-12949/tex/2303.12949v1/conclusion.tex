\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec_conc}
In this paper, we have presented a dynamic STC approach for output feedback in nonlinear NCS. The approach is based on hybrid Lyapunov functions and a dynamic variable that encodes past state information to determine sampling instants. Instead of the plant state, the state of an asymptotically stable continuous-time observer is used to determine transmission times.

The design of the STC mechanism is decoupled from the observer design and the same assumptions on the plant as for the full state-feedback case are used. Stability guarantees were derived and the proposed approach was illustrated with
 a numerical example.

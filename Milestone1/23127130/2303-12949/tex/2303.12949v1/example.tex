\section{Example}
\label{sec_ex}
In this section, we illustrate the proposed STC approach with a numerical example from the literature. We consider the single link robot arm example from \cite{postoyan2014tracking}. The plant is given by 
\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}
		x_{p,1}&= x_{p,2}\\
		x_{p,2}&= -a\sin(x_{p,1}) + b\hat{u}\\
		y&=x_{p,1}
	\end{split}	
\end{equation*}
and the static state-feedback controller by \linebreak
%
	$u = b^{-1}\left(a\sin(x_{o,1})-x_{o,1}-x_{o,2}\right).$
%
%
We consider an observer given by 
\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}
		x_{o,1} &= x_{o,2} + \theta_1\left(y-x_{o,1}\right)\\
		x_{o,2} &= -a\sin(x_{o,1}) +b\hat{u} + \theta_2\left(y-x_{o,1}\right)
	\end{split}
\end{equation*}
for $\theta_1,\theta_2\in\R$. We define $x_p = \begin{bmatrix}
	x_{p,1} & x_{p,2}
\end{bmatrix}^\top$, $e = \begin{bmatrix}
	e_1 & e_2
\end{bmatrix}^\top = \begin{bmatrix}
	\hat{x}_{o,1} - x_{p,1} & \hat{x}_{o,2} - x_{p,2}
\end{bmatrix}^\top$
and $e_o = \begin{bmatrix}
	e_{o,1} & e_{o,2}
\end{bmatrix}^\top = \linebreak \begin{bmatrix}
	{x}_{o,1} - x_{p,1} & {x}_{o,2} - x_{p,2}
\end{bmatrix}^\top$.

Note again that Assumption~\ref{asum_hybrid_lyap} is identical as for the state-feedback case and can thus be verified as in state-feedback case based on linear matrix inequalities. Details on the verification procedure for the considered example are omitted for brevity but can be found in \cite[Section VI.A]{hertneck21robust_arxiv}.
%
%
Using 
\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}
		&-a\left(\sin(x_{p,1}) - \sin(x_{o,1})\right)\\
%
		=&2a\cos\left(\frac{2x_{p,1}+e_{o,1}}{2}\right) \sin\left(-\frac{e_{o,1}}{2}\right) = \tilde{a} e_{o,1}
	\end{split}
\end{equation*}
for a varying parameter $\tilde{a}\in\left[-a,a\right]$, the dynamics of the observer error can be written as
%
	$\dot{e}_o = \begin{bmatrix}
		-\theta_1 & 1\\
		-\theta_2+\tilde{a} & 0
	\end{bmatrix} e_o$
%
and it can be easily verified that Assumption~\ref{as_obs_er} holds if $\theta_1 > 0$ and $\theta_2 + \tilde{a} > 0$ for all $\tilde{a}\in\left[-a,a\right]$. 
%
Subsequently, we consider $a = \frac{9.81}{2}$ and $b=2$. Using the approach from \cite[Section~VI.A]{hertneck21robust_arxiv}, we have computed $n_\tpar = 23$ different parameter sets that satisfy Assumption~\ref{asum_hybrid_lyap} with $\epsilon_i \in \left[-20,0.01\right]$. Moreover, we have chosen $\theta_1 = \theta_2 = 10$. The maximum sampling interval, for which UGAS can be guaranteed for periodic sampling, is $t_{\min} = \SI{0.175}{\second}$. 

To demonstrate our approach, we compare the required number of transmissions for the proposed STC mechanism  for 1000 randomly selected initial conditions to the number of transmissions that are needed for periodic sampling with stability guarantees. 
%
The initial conditions for $x_p$ and $x_o$ where drawn uniformly from 
%
$	\begin{bmatrix}
		x_{p,1}(0,0)& x_{p,2}(0,0)& x_{o,1}(0,0)& x_{o,2}(0,0)
	\end{bmatrix}\in\left[-10,10\right]^4.$
%
 We consider $n_\eta = 15$ and $\eta_i(0,0) = V(x_o(0,0))$ for $i\in\left\lbrace 1,\dots,n_\eta \right\rbrace$. In the first $\SI{10}{\second}$, the proposed STC mechanism requires on average 29.8 transmissions. In comparison, for periodic sampling 56 transmissions are needed for the same time span. For trajectories with a duration of $\SI{50}{\second}$ and the same initial conditions, the proposed STC mechanism requires on average 92.4 samples whilst 282 transmissions are needed for periodic sampling, leading to reduction of the required number of transmissions by factor $\frac{1}{3}$ for the proposed STC approach. 
%
For the considered example, the amount of reduction is larger if a larger time span is considered. A reason for that is that the observer state $x_o$ is used to determine transmission times instead of the plant state $x_p$. It can therefore happen that the value of $V(x_o)$, i.e., of the Lyapunov function for the observer state increases significantly at the beginning as the observer state converges, leading to frequent transmissions at the beginning. An exemplary trajectory where this occurs is given in Figure~\ref{fig_states}. The respective transmission intervals are given in Figure~\ref{fig_inters}.
%
%
To compensate the initial increase of the Lyapunov function, the initial values for $\eta$ could be chosen differently at the cost of reduced convergence speed.

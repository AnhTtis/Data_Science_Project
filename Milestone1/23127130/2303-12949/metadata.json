    "abstract": "Most approaches for self-triggered control (STC) of nonlinear networked control systems (NCS) require measurements of the full system state to determine transmission times. However, for most control systems only a lower dimensional output is available. To bridge this gap, we present in this paper an output-feedback STC approach for nonlinear NCS. An asymptotically stable observer is used to reconstruct the plant state and transmission times are determined based on the observer state. The approach employs hybrid Lyapunov functions and a dynamic variable to encode past state information and to maximize the time between transmissions. It is non-conservative in the sense that the assumptions on plant and controller are the same as for dynamic STC based on hybrid Lyapunov functions with full state measurements and any asymptotically stabilizing observer can be used. We conclude that the proposed STC approach guarantees asymptotic stability of the origin for the closed-loop system.",

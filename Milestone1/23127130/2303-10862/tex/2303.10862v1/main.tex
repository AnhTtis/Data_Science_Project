\section{Acknowledgements}
We thank David Moore for initiating contact between Q-Flex and PNNL and providing early cable designs. We are grateful to the nEXO and DAMIC collaborations for sharing their proposed cable designs and for discussions on the cable radioactive background targets as well as electrical and mechanical requirements. We thank Marcel Conde for electrically testing the cable after fabrication, Andrea Pocar for helpful discussions on work that was previously done for EXO-200, and Cesar Arciniega for helping with some of the graphics for the paper.

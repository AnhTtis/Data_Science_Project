    "abstract": "Growth curves are commonly used in modeling aimed at crop yield prediction. Fitting such curves often depends on availability of detailed observations, such as individual grape bunch weight or individual apple weight. However, in practice, aggregated weights (such as a bucket of grape bunches or apples) are available instead. While treating such bucket averages as if they were individual observations is tempting, it may introduce bias particularly with respect to population variance. In this paper we provide an elegant solution which enables estimation of individual weights using Dirichlet priors within Bayesian inferential framework.",

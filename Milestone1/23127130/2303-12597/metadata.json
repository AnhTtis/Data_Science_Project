    "abstract": "We discuss generalized baby Skyrmions emerging in a (1+2)-dimensional $σ$ model with the Lie-Algebraic structure. The O(3) symmetry of the target space is lost in the general case, but O(2) is preserved. Both the topological charge and the soliton mass are determined. Of a special interest is a limiting case of the large deformation parameter. The model under consideration interpolates between CP(1) and the cigar model.",

In medical imaging, harmonized data exchange formats such as Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine and electronic data storage are the standard, partially addressing the first issue, but the requirements for privacy preservation are equally strict. To prevent patient privacy compromise while promoting scientific research on large datasets that aims to improve patient care, the implementation of technical solutions to simultaneously address the demands for data protection and utilization is mandatory.

  abstract = {Nowadays, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is growing by leaps and bounds in almost all fields of technology, and Autonomous Vehicles (AV) research is one more of them. This paper proposes the using of algorithms based on Deep Learning (DL) in the control layer of an autonomous vehicle. More specifically, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms such as Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) are implemented in order to compare results between them. The aim of this work is to obtain a trained model, applying a DRL algorithm, able of sending control commands to the vehicle to navigate properly and efficiently following a determined route. In addition, for each of the algorithms, several agents are presented as a solution, so that each of these agents uses different data sources to achieve the vehicle control commands. For this purpose, an open-source simulator such as CARLA is used, providing to the system with the ability to perform a multitude of tests without any risk into an hyper-realistic urban simulation environment, something that is unthinkable in the real world. The results obtained show that both DQN and DDPG reach the goal, but DDPG obtains a better performance. DDPG perfoms trajectories very similar to classic controller as LQR. In both cases RMSE is lower than 0.1m following trajectories with a range 180-700m. To conclude, some conclusions and future works are commented.}

  abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) is expected to play a prominent role for privacy-preserving machine learning (ML) in autonomous vehicles. FL involves the collaborative training of a single ML model among edge devices on their distributed datasets while keeping data locally. While FL requires less communication compared to classical distributed learning, it remains hard to scale for large models. In vehicular networks, FL must be adapted to the limited communication resources, the mobility of the edge nodes, and the statistical heterogeneity of data distributions. Indeed, a judicious utilization of the communication resources alongside new perceptive learning-oriented methods are vital. To this end, we propose a new architecture for vehicular FL and corresponding learning and scheduling processes. The architecture utilizes vehicular-to-vehicular(V2V) resources to bypass the communication bottleneck where clusters of vehicles train models simultaneously and only the aggregate of each cluster is sent to the multi-access edge (MEC) server. The cluster formation is adapted for single and multi-task learning, and takes into account both communication and learning aspects. We show through simulations that the proposed process is capable of improving the learning accuracy in several non-independent and-identically-distributed (non-i.i.d) and unbalanced datasets distributions, under mobility constraints, in comparison to standard FL.},

  abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is a collaborative machine learning framework to enable different clients such as Internet of Things (IoT) devices to participate in a machine learning model training process, while preserving data privacy. Client selection is critical to determine the performance of FL. Most of the existing client selection methods aim to maximize the number of selected clients, who can upload their local models before the deadline, in each global iteration, thus potentially accelerating the model convergence rate. However, these methods ignore the fact that most of the IoT devices are powered by on-board batteries and harvested green energy from the environment to prolong battery life. Hence, clients selected by these methods may not have sufficient energy to upload their local models in a global iteration or are unable to participate in the training process in the near future due to battery drainage. In this paper, we propose a novel client selection, entitled ``EnerGy-AwaRe CliEnt SElection for Green FeDerated Learning (GREED)'', to optimize the trade-off between maximizing the number of selected clients and minimizing the energy drawn from batteries for the selected clients, while ensuring that all the selected clients have sufficient energy to upload their local models before the deadline. The performance of GREED is validated via extensive simulations.},

However, due to privacy concerns and the high cost of transmitting video data, it is highly challenging to build object detection models on centrally stored large training datasets following the current approach. Federated learning (FL) is a promising approach to resolve this challenge. Nevertheless, there currently lacks an easy to use tool to enable computer vision application developers who are not experts in federated learning to conveniently leverage this technology and apply it in their systems. In this paper, we report \&lt;em\&gt;FedVision\&lt;/em\&gt; - a machine learning engineering platform to support the development of federated learning powered computer vision applications. The platform has been deployed through a collaboration between \&lt;em\&gt;WeBank\&lt;/em\&gt; and \&lt;em\&gt;Extreme Vision\&lt;/em\&gt; to help customers develop computer vision-based safety monitoring solutions in smart city applications. Over four months of usage, it has achieved significant efficiency improvement and cost reduction while removing the need to transmit sensitive data for three major corporate customers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first real application of FL in computer vision-based tasks.\&lt;/p\&gt;}

  abstract = {Autonomous driving is a rapidly developing technology that is also a source of debate. People believe that autonomous vehicles will provide a better future by increasing road safety, lowering infrastructure expenses, and improving mobility for children, the old, and the disabled. On the other hand, many individuals are concerned about incidences of automotive hacking, the likelihood of fatal crashes, and the loss of driving-related professions. Autonomous driving is, without a question, a complex and problematic technology for many people. To better comprehend how safe self-driving cars are, it's necessary to first understand how they function, as well as what kind of sensors autonomous vehicles use to determine where they should travel and recognize things on the road in order to avoid automobile accidents. Data collected by the sensors exhibit heterogeneous and multimodal characteristics, which are further fused to frame effective decision rules. Thus sensors play a major role in decision making activity of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). In order to acquire more information related to the sensors, this paper analyses and summarizes different types of AV sensors based on their mandatory attributes. This analysis helps the readers to understand the contribution of the sensors towards decision-making in AVs and also summarizes the data types collected by different sensors. The summarized inferences will be an eye-opener to most of the budding researchers and students in the field of AVs to select the appropriate sensor based on their needs for their research. The study also gives brief information regarding the specifications of different categories of sensors manufactured by leading vendors in the market.},

This paper first describes the characteristics of roadside LiDAR and the challenges of object detection and then reviews in detail the current methods of object detection based on a single roadside LiDAR and multi-LiDAR cooperatives. Then, some studies for roadside LiDAR perception in adverse weather and datasets released in recent years are introduced. Finally, some current open challenges and future works for roadside LiDAR perception are discussed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically study roadside LiDAR perception methods and datasets. It has an important guiding role in further promoting the research of roadside LiDAR perception for practical applications.}

ABSTRACT = {The complex decision-making systems used for autonomous vehicles or advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) are being replaced by end-to-end (e2e) architectures based on deep-neural-networks (DNN). DNNs can learn complex driving actions from datasets containing thousands of images and data obtained from the vehicle perception system. This work presents the classification, design and implementation of six e2e architectures capable of generating the driving actions of speed and steering wheel angle directly on the vehicle control elements. The work details the design stages and optimization process of the convolutional networks to develop six e2e architectures. In the metric analysis the architectures have been tested with different data sources from the vehicle, such as images, XYZ accelerations and XYZ angular speeds. The best results were obtained with a mixed data e2e architecture that used front images from the vehicle and angular speeds to predict the speed and steering wheel angle with a mean error of 1.06%. An exhaustive optimization process of the convolutional blocks has demonstrated that it is possible to design lightweight e2e architectures with high performance more suitable for the final implementation in autonomous driving.},

  abstract = {The existing trajectory prediction is mainly for specific road sections, which is poor to adapt to complex and changing traffic scenarios. Meanwhile, decentralized trajectory data is hard to be fully utilized in the data silo environment. To solve data silos in the intelligent vehicle industry, introducing federated learning methods in vehicular edge computing has attracted extensive attention. But traditional federated learning still has the potential to suffer from the mining of training data in the case of model privacy leakage. In this paper, a vehicle trajectory prediction method based on federated learning and homomorphic encryption has been presented, which adopts a three-layer architecture with a vehicle cluster, edge computing server, and cloud core network. Compared with traditional centralized deep learning methods, this approach enables joint modeling of multiple parties to improve the model's generalization performance. We used a proxy re-encryption algorithm to implement key distribution and also designed an encrypted federated network algorithm FAHEFL, which uses FAHE1 homomorphic encryption to protect the privacy of the model in parameter transmission. Each local model includes a driving behavior recognition module and trajectory output module. The driving behavior recognition module uses a 1D convolutional neural network to recognize the driving behavior, then input recognition results and historical trajectories to the trajectory output module, which uses LSTM neural network to output predicted trajectories. The experiment results show that the model built with FAHEFL has no more 1\% error in the driving behavior recognition module than concentrated learning, while the minimum mean square error of the trajectory prediction module increased by only 2.5\%. This article also discusses the performance between FAHEFL and well-known cryptographic federation network algorithms.},

  abstract = {Currently, the complex traffic environment challenges the fast and accurate response of a connected autonomous vehicle (CAV). More importantly, it is difficult for different CAVs to collaborate and share knowledge. To remedy that, this paper proposes a selective federated reinforcement learning (SFRL) strategy to achieve online knowledge aggregation strategy to improve the accuracy and environmental adaptability of the autonomous driving model. First, we propose a federated reinforcement learning framework that allows participants to use the knowledge of other CAVs to make corresponding actions, thereby realizing online knowledge transfer and aggregation. Second, we use reinforcement learning to train local driving models of CAVs to cope with collision avoidance tasks. Third, considering the efficiency of federated learning (FL) and the additional communication overhead it brings, we propose a CAVs selection strategy before uploading local models. When selecting CAVs, we consider the reputation of CAVs, the quality of local models, and time overhead, so as to select as many high-quality users as possible while considering resources and time constraints. With above strategic processes, our framework can aggregate and reuse the knowledge learned by CAVs traveling in different environments to assist in driving decisions. Extensive simulation results validate that our proposal can improve model accuracy and learning efficiency while reducing communication overhead.},

Toward this future goal, this work aims to extend Federated Learning (FL), a decentralized learning framework that enables privacy-preserving training of models, to work with heterogeneous clients in a practical cellular network. The FL protocol iteratively asks random clients to download a trainable model from a server, update it with own data, and upload the updated model to the server, while asking the server to aggregate multiple client updates to further improve the model. While clients in this protocol are free from disclosing own private data, the overall training process can become inefficient when some clients are with limited computational resources (i.e., requiring longer update time) or under poor wireless channel conditions (longer upload time). Our new FL protocol, which we refer to as FedCS, mitigates this problem and performs FL efficiently while actively managing clients based on their resource conditions. Specifically, FedCS solves a client selection problem with resource constraints, which allows the server to aggregate as many client updates as possible and to accelerate performance improvement in ML models. We conducted an experimental evaluation using publicly-available large-scale image datasets to train deep neural networks on MEC environment simulations. The experimental results show that FedCS is able to complete its training process in a significantly shorter time compared to the original FL protocol.},

  abstract = {The deployment of future intelligent transportation systems is contingent upon seamless and reliable operation of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). One key challenge in developing CAVs is the design of an autonomous controller that can make use of wireless connectivity and accurately execute control decisions, such as a quick acceleration when merging to a highway and frequent speed changes in a stop-and-go traffic. However, the use of conventional feedback controllers or traditional machine learning based controllers, solely trained by the CAV's local data, cannot guarantee a robust controller performance over a wide range of road conditions and traffic dynamics. In this paper, a new federated learning (FL) framework enabled by the CAVs' wireless connectivity is proposed for the autonomous controller design of CAVs. In this framework, the learning models used by the controllers are collaboratively trained among a group of CAVs. To capture the varying CAV participation in FL and the diverse local data quality among CAVs, a novel dynamic federated proximal (DFP) algorithm is proposed that accounts for the mobility of CAVs, the wireless channel dynamics, as well as the unbalanced and non-independent and identically distributed data across CAVs. A rigorous convergence study is performed for the proposed algorithm under realistic wireless environments. Then, the impact of varying CAV participation in FL process and diverse local data quality of CAVs on the convergence is explicitly analyzed. Simulation results that use real vehicular data show that the proposed DFP-based controller can accurately track the target speed over time and under different traffic scenarios, and it yields a distance error two times smaller than controllers designed using traditional machine learning solutions trained with the CAV's local data. The results also show that the proposed DFP algorithm is well-suited for the autonomous controller design in CAVs when compared to popular FL algorithms, such as federated averaging (FedAvg) and federated proximal (FedProx) algorithms.},

Different Deep Learning (DL) architectures have been applied to predict the steering angle of AVs in various scenarios. A survey on steering angle prediction based on deep learning algorithms can help expert researchers identify those areas that require development. Also, novice researchers can use the survey as a starting point. In this article, we present a broad study on the recent advances made in DL architectures that covers the steering angle prediction of AVs. A new comprehensive taxonomy of the application of DL in steering angle prediction of AVs is created. The survey presents a concise research summary synthesis, and analysis. It is found that most researchers depend on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) over other DL architectures in predicting the steering angle of autonomous driving vehicles. Also identified are open research problems. The prominent challenge facing DL-based steering angle prediction of AVs is lack of sufficient real-world datasets, which means that researchers largely depend on data generated from simulated environments. Lastly, alternative viewpoints to solve the identified open research challenges are proposed, pointing towards promising future research directions.},

Standard federated optimization methods such as Federated Averaging (FedAvg) are often difficult to tune and exhibit unfavorable convergence behavior.

In this work, we propose federated versions of adaptive optimizers, including Adagrad, Adam, and Yogi, and analyze their convergence in the presence of heterogeneous data for general non-convex settings. Our results highlight the interplay between client heterogeneity and communication efficiency. We also perform extensive experiments on these methods and show that the use of adaptive optimizers can significantly improve the performance of federated learning.},

However, machine learning faces critical challenges, e.g., data imbalance, edge dynamics, and resource constraints, in edge computing. The existing FL solutions cannot well cope with data imbalance or edge dynamics, and may cause high resource cost. In this paper, we propose an adaptive asynchronous federated learning (AAFL) mechanism. To deal with edge dynamics, a certain fraction {$\alpha\alpha$} of all local updates will be aggregated by their arrival order at the parameter server in each epoch. Moreover, the system can intelligently vary the number of local updated models for global model aggregation in different epochs with network situations. We then propose experience-driven algorithms based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to adaptively determine the optimal value of {$\alpha\alpha$} in each epoch for two cases of AAFL, single learning task and multiple learning tasks, so as to achieve less completion time of training under resource constraints. Extensive experiments on the classical models and datasets show high effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. Specifically, AAFL can reduce the completion time by about 70 percent and improve the learning accuracy by about 28 percent under resource constraints, compared with the state-of-the-art solutions.},

However, the existing blockchain has a number of drawbacks that prevent it from being used as a generic platform for IoT. The nodes in IoT are heavily resource-limited, especially computing and networking resources. Unfortunately, they are necessary for the blockchain to solve complicated puzzles and propagate blocks. In this paper, we propose agent mining and cloud mining approaches to solve the above problem in the blockchain-enabled IoT. To be specific, miners act as mining agents for nodes in IoT, offload mining tasks to cloud computing servers, and use networking resources dynamically. Furthermore, in order to enhance the performance, the access selection of users, computing resources allocation, and networking resources allocation are formulated as a joint optimization problem. We then propose a dueling deep reinforcement learning approach to address this problem. Numerical results justify the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.},

  abstract = {Recently, the concept of autonomous driving became prevalent in the domain of intelligent transportation due to the promises of increased safety, traffic efficiency, fuel economy and reduced travel time. Numerous studies have been conducted in this area to help newcomer vehicles plan their trajectory and velocity. However, most of these proposals only consider trajectory planning using conjunction with a limited data set (i.e., metropolis areas, highways, and residential areas) or assume fully connected and automated vehicle environment. Moreover, these approaches are not explainable and lack trust regarding the contributions of the participating vehicles. To tackle these problems, we design an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning model to improve the effectiveness and trustworthiness of the trajectory decisions for newcomer Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). When a newcomer AV seeks help for trajectory planning, the edge server launches a federated learning process to train the trajectory and velocity prediction model in a distributed collaborative fashion among participating AVs. One essential challenge in this approach is AVs selection, i.e., how to select the appropriate AVs that should participate in the federated learning process. For this purpose, XAI is first used to compute the contribution of each feature contributed by each vehicle to the overall solution. This helps us compute the trust value for each AV in the model. Then, a trust-based deep reinforcement learning model is put forward to make the selection decisions. Experiments using a real-life dataset show that our solution achieves better performance than benchmark solutions (i.e., Deep Q-Network (DQN), and Random Selection (RS)).},

  abstract = {Recently, the concept of autonomous driving became prevalent in the domain of intelligent transportation due to the promises of increased safety, traffic efficiency, fuel economy and reduced travel time. Numerous studies have been conducted in this area to help newcomer vehicles plan their trajectory and velocity. However, most of these proposals only consider trajectory planning using conjunction with a limited data set (i.e., metropolis areas, highways, and residential areas) or assume fully connected and automated vehicle environment. Moreover, these approaches are not explainable and lack trust regarding the contributions of the participating vehicles. To tackle these problems, we design an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning model to improve the effectiveness and trustworthiness of the trajectory decisions for newcomer Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). When a newcomer AV seeks help for trajectory planning, the edge server launches a federated learning process to train the trajectory and velocity prediction model in a distributed collaborative fashion among participating AVs. One essential challenge in this approach is AVs selection, i.e., how to select the appropriate AVs that should participate in the federated learning process. For this purpose, XAI is first used to compute the contribution of each feature contributed by each vehicle to the overall solution. This helps us compute the trust value for each AV in the model. Then, a trust-based deep reinforcement learning model is put forward to make the selection decisions. Experiments using a real-life dataset show that our solution achieves better performance than benchmark solutions (i.e., Deep Q-Network (DQN), and Random Selection (RS)).},

  abstract = {Federated learning (FL) has been widely adopted to train machine learning models over massive data in edge computing. However, machine learning faces critical challenges, e.g., data imbalance, edge dynamics, and resource constraints, in edge computing. The existing FL solutions cannot well cope with data imbalance or edge dynamics, and may cause high resource cost. In this paper, we propose an adaptive asynchronous federated learning (AAFL) mechanism. To deal with edge dynamics, a certain fraction {$\alpha\alpha$} of all local updates will be aggregated by their arrival order at the parameter server in each epoch. Moreover, the system can intelligently vary the number of local updated models for global model aggregation in different epochs with network situations. We then propose experience-driven algorithms based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to adaptively determine the optimal value of {$\alpha\alpha$} in each epoch for two cases of AAFL, single learning task and multiple learning tasks, so as to achieve less completion time of training under resource constraints. Extensive experiments on the classical models and datasets show high effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. Specifically, AAFL can reduce the completion time by about 70 percent and improve the learning accuracy by about 28 percent under resource constraints, compared with the state-of-the-art solutions.},

Different from recent prior works, that either attempt inexact minimization or utilize devices for parallelizing gradient computation, we propose a dynamic regularizer for each device at each round, so that in the limit the global and device solutions are aligned. We demonstrate both through empirical results on real and synthetic data as well as analytical results that our scheme leads to efficient training, in both convex and non-convex settings, while being fully agnostic to device heterogeneity and robust to large number of devices, partial participation and unbalanced data.},

  abstract = {Federated learning enables a large amount of edge computing devices to jointly learn a model without data sharing. As a leading algorithm in this setting, Federated Averaging (\textbackslash texttt\{FedAvg\}) runs Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) in parallel on a small subset of the total devices and averages the sequences only once in a while. Despite its simplicity, it lacks theoretical guarantees under realistic settings. In this paper, we analyze the convergence of \textbackslash texttt\{FedAvg\} on non-iid data and establish a convergence rate of \$\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}(\textbackslash frac\{1\}\{T\})\$ for strongly convex and smooth problems, where \$T\$ is the number of SGDs. Importantly, our bound demonstrates a trade-off between communication-efficiency and convergence rate. As user devices may be disconnected from the server, we relax the assumption of full device participation to partial device participation and study different averaging schemes; low device participation rate can be achieved without severely slowing down the learning. Our results indicate that heterogeneity of data slows down the convergence, which matches empirical observations. Furthermore, we provide a necessary condition for \textbackslash texttt\{FedAvg\} on non-iid data: the learning rate \$\textbackslash eta\$ must decay, even if full-gradient is used; otherwise, the solution will be \$\textbackslash Omega (\textbackslash eta)\$ away from the optimal.},

However, this rich data is often privacy sensitive, large in quantity, or both, which may preclude logging to the data center and training there using conventional approaches.  We advocate an alternative that leaves the training data distributed on the mobile devices, and learns a shared model by aggregating locally-computed updates. We term this decentralized approach Federated Learning.  We present a practical method for the federated learning of deep networks based on iterative model averaging, and conduct an extensive empirical evaluation, considering five different model architectures and four datasets. These experiments demonstrate the approach is robust to the unbalanced and non-IID data distributions that are a defining characteristic of this setting. Communication costs are the principal constraint, and we show a reduction in required communication rounds by 10-100x as compared to synchronized stochastic gradient descent.},

  abstract = 	 {Federated learning is a key scenario in modern large-scale machine learning where the data remains distributed over a large number of clients and the task is to learn a centralized model without transmitting the client data. The standard optimization algorithm used in this setting is Federated Averaging (FedAvg) due to its low communication cost. We obtain a tight characterization of the convergence of FedAvg and prove that heterogeneity (non-iid-ness) in the client’s data results in a ‘drift’ in the local updates resulting in poor performance. As a solution, we propose a new algorithm (SCAFFOLD) which uses control variates (variance reduction) to correct for the ‘client drift’. We prove that SCAFFOLD requires significantly fewer communication rounds and is not affected by data heterogeneity or client sampling. Further, we show that (for quadratics) SCAFFOLD can take advantage of similarity in the client’s data yielding even faster convergence. The latter is the first result to quantify the usefulness of local-steps in distributed optimization.}

  abstract = {Cooperative perception plays a vital role in extending a vehicle's sensing range beyond its lineof-sight. However, exchanging raw sensory data under limited communication resources is infeasible. Towards enabling an efficient cooperative perception, vehicles need to address the following fundamental question: What sensory data needs to be shared? at which resolution? and with which vehicles? To answer this question, in this paper, a novel framework is proposed to allow reinforcement learning (RL)-based vehicular association, resource block (RB) allocation, and content selection of cooperative perception messages (CPMs) by utilizing a quadtree-based point cloud compression mechanism. Furthermore, a federated RL approach is introduced in order to speed up the training process across vehicles. Simulation results show the ability of the RL agents to efficiently learn the vehicles' association, RB allocation, and message content selection while maximizing vehicles' satisfaction in terms of the received sensory information. The results also show that federated RL improves the training process, where better policies can be achieved within the same amount of time compared to the non-federated approach.},

Currently, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) model is trained through online learning by exchanging the local and global updates.

This paper aims to understand the past and future challenges, trends, and applications of new learning adopted in autonomous systems with a proposed schema of FTL-enabled autonomous models training. The goal behind minimizing the latency through the proposed FTL Interlocking Dependency Evaluation schema in exchanging the local and global updates is to match with the real-time application scenario by ensuring security and privacy features. The evaluation parameters used in estimating the performance of new learning are window size, back-off time, recovery policy (retransmission), scalability, peak data rate (Gbps), user-experienced data rate (Mbps), mobility (Kmph), latency (ms), end-to-end delay analysis, connection density (devices/km2), and area traffic capacity (Mb/s/m2). The evaluation results have validated the reliability of the proposed model for computing autonomous systems using a novel FTL Interlocking Dependency Evaluation schema for higher order of interdependency on vehicular environment processing.},

Applications of FL led to the development and study of federated reinforcement learning (FRL). Few works exist on the topic of FRL applied to autonomous vehicle (AV) platoons. In addition, most FRL works choose a single aggregation method (usually weight or gradient aggregation). We explore FRL's effectiveness as a means to improve AV platooning by designing and implementing an FRL framework atop a custom AV platoon environment. The application of FRL in AV platooning is studied under two scenarios: (1) Inter-platoon FRL (Inter-FRL) where FRL is applied to AVs across different platoons; (2) Intra-platoon FRL (Intra-FRL) where FRL is applied to AVs within a single platoon. Both Inter-FRL and Intra-FRL are applied to a custom AV platooning environment using both gradient and weight aggregation to observe the performance effects FRL can have on AV platoons relative to an AV platooning environment trained without FRL. It is concluded that Intra-FRL using weight aggregation (Intra-FRLWA) provides the best performance for controlling an AV platoon. In addition, we found that weight aggregation in FRL for AV platooning provides increases in performance relative to gradient aggregation. Finally, a performance analysis is conducted for Intra-FRLWA versus a platooning environment without FRL for platoons of length 3, 4 and 5 vehicles. It is concluded that Intra-FRLWA largely out-performs the platooning environment that is trained without FRL.},

However, large-scale collection of AV s' data for training will inevitably result in a privacy leakage problem. Federated Learning (FL) is proposed to solve privacy leakage problems, but it is exposed to security threats such as model inversion, membership inference. Therefore, the vulnerability of the FL should be brought to the forefront when applying to AV s. We propose a novel Byzantine-Fault-Tolerant (BFT) decentralized FL method with privacy-preservation for AV s called BDFL. In this paper, a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) FL with BFT is built by extending the HydRand protocol. In order to protect their model, each AV uses the Publicly Verifiable Secret Sharing(PVSS) scheme, which allows anyone to verify the correctness of encrypted shares. The evaluation results on the MNIST dataset have shown that introducing decentralized FL into AV area is feasible, and the proposed BDFL is superior to other BFT-based FL method. Furthermore, the experimental results on KITTI dataset indicate the practicality of BDFL on improving performances of multi-object recognition in AV areas. Finally, the proposed PVSS-based data privacy preservation scheme is also justified its characteristic of no side-effect on models' parameters by the experiments on the MNIST and KITTI datasets.},

  abstract = {In this paper we envision a federated learning (FL) scenario in service of amending the performance of autonomous road vehicles, through a drone traffic monitor (DTM), that also acts as an orchestrator. Expecting non-IID data distribution, we focus on the issue of accelerating the learning of a particular class of critical object (CO), that may harm the nominal operation of an autonomous vehicle. This can be done through proper allocation of the wireless resources for addressing learner and data heterogeneity. Thus, we propose a reactive method for the allocation of wireless resources, that happens dynamically each FL round, and is based on each learner's contribution to the general model. In addition to this, we explore the use of static methods that remain constant across all rounds. Since we expect partial work from each learner, we use the FedProx FL algorithm, in the task of computer vision. For testing, we construct a non-IID data distribution of the MNIST and FMNIST datasets among four types of learners, in scenarios that represent the quickly changing environment. The results show that proactive measures are effective and versatile at improving system accuracy, and quickly learning the CO class when underrepresented in the network. Furthermore, the experiments show a tradeoff between FedProx intensity and resource allocation efforts. Nonetheless, a well adjusted FedProx local optimizer allows for an even better overall accuracy, particularly when using deeper neural network (NN) implementations.},

  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) has recently been adopted in vehicular networks for applications such as autonomous driving, road safety prediction and vehicular object detection, due to its model-free characteristic, allowing adaptive fast response. However, most of these ML applications employ centralized learning (CL), which brings significant overhead for data transmission between the parameter server and vehicular edge devices. Federated learning (FL) framework has been recently introduced as an efficient tool with the goal of reducing transmission overhead while achieving privacy through the transmission of model updates instead of the whole dataset. In this paper, we investigate the usage of FL over CL in vehicular network applications to develop intelligent transportation systems. We provide a comprehensive analysis on the feasibility of FL for the ML based vehicular applications, as well as investigating object detection by utilizing image-based datasets as a case study. Then, we identify the major challenges from both learning perspective, i.e., data labeling and model training, and from the communications point of view, i.e., data rate, reliability, transmission overhead, privacy and resource management. Finally, we highlight related future research directions for FL in vehicular networks.},

A connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) is an AV with vehicle connectivity capability, which enhances the situational awareness of the AV and enables the cooperation between AVs. Hence, CAV technology can enhance the capabilities and robustness of AV to be a promising transportation solution in the future. This paper introduces a representative architecture of CAVs and surveys the latest research advances, methods, and algorithms for sensing, perception, planning, and control of CAVs. It reviews the state-of-the-art and state-of-the-practice (when applicable) of a multi-layer Perception-Planning-Control architecture including on-board sensors and vehicular communications, the methods of sensor fusion and localization and mapping in the perception layer, the algorithms of decision making and trajectory planning in the planning layer, and the control strategies of trajectory tracking in the control layer. Furthermore, the implementations and impact of vehicle connectivity and the corresponding consequential challenges of cooperative perception, complex connected decision making, and multi-vehicle controls are summarized and their significant research issues enumerated. Most importantly, the critical review in this paper provides a list and discussion of the remaining challenges and unsolved problems of CAVs in each Section which would be helpful to researchers in the field.

  abstract = {In federated learning, multiple client devices jointly learn a machine learning model: each client device maintains a local model for its local training dataset, while a master device maintains a global model via aggregating the local models from the client devices. The machine learning community recently proposed several federated learning methods that were claimed to be robust against Byzantine failures (e.g., system failures, adversarial manipulations) of certain client devices. In this work, we perform the first systematic study on local model poisoning attacks to federated learning. We assume an attacker has compromised some client devices, and the attacker manipulates the local model parameters on the compromised client devices during the learning process such that the global model has a large testing error rate. We formulate our attacks as optimization problems and apply our attacks to four recent Byzantine-robust federated learning methods. Our empirical results on four real-world datasets show that our attacks can substantially increase the error rates of the models learnt by the federated learning methods that were claimed to be robust against Byzantine failures of some client devices. We generalize two defenses for data poisoning attacks to defend against our local model poisoning attacks. Our evaluation results show that one defense can effectively defend against our attacks in some cases, but the defenses are not effective enough in other cases, highlighting the need for new defenses against our local model poisoning attacks to federated learning.},

In this article, we survey the existing literature toward efficient and secured learning in a dynamic wireless environment. In particular, a BCL framework for AI-enabled CAVs is presented. The framework enables distributed CAVs to train ML models locally and upload to blockchain network to overall utilize the ``collective intelligence'' of CAVs while avoiding large amounts of data transmission.

In most existing connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), a large amount of driving data collected from multiple vehicles are sent to a central server for unified training. However, data privacy and security have become crucial during the data-sharing process. Federated learning (FL) for data security has arisen nowadays, and it can improve the data privacy of distribute machine learning. However, the malicious attackers can still be able to attack the training process. Due to the complete reliance on the central server, FL is very fragile. To address the above problem, we propose Bift: 1) a fully decentralized ML system combined with FL and 2) blockchain to provide a privacy-preserving ML process for CAVs. Bift enables distributed CAVs to train ML models locally using their own driving data and then to upload the local models to get a better global model. More importantly, Bift provides a consensus algorithm named Proof of Federated Learning to resist possible adversaries. We evaluate the performance of Bift and demonstrate that Bift is scalable and robust, and can defend against malicious attacks.},

Autonomous driving cars using federated learning (FL) has the ability to enable different smart services. Although FL implements distributed machine learning model training without the requirement to move the data of devices to a centralized server, it its own implementation challenges such as robustness, centralized server security, communication resources constraints, and privacy leakage due to the capability of a malicious aggregation server to infer sensitive information of end-devices. To address the aforementioned limitations, a dispersed federated learning (DFL) framework for autonomous driving cars is proposed to offer robust, communication resourceefficient, and privacy-aware learning. A mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) optimization problem is formulated to jointly minimize the loss in federated learning model accuracy due to packet errors and transmission latency. Due to the NPhard and non-convex nature of the formulated MINLP problem, we propose the Block Successive Upper-bound Minimization (BSUM) based solution. Furthermore, the performance comparison of the proposed scheme with three baseline schemes has been carried out. Extensive numerical results are provided to show the validity of the proposed BSUM-based scheme.},

  abstract = {Federated learning-based automotive navigation has recently received considerable attention, as it can potentially address the issue of weak global positioning system (GPS) signals under severe blockages, such as in downtowns and tunnels. Specifically, the data-driven navigation framework combines the position estimation offered by the high-sampling inertial measurement units (IMUs) and the position calibration provided by the low-sampling GPS signals. Despite its promise, the privacy preservation and flexibility of the participating users in the federated learning process are still problematic. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose an efficient, flexible, and privacy-preserving model aggregation scheme under a federated learning-based navigation framework named FedLoc. Specifically, our proposed scheme efficiently protects the locally trained model updates, flexibly supports the fluctuation of participants, and is robust against unregistered malicious users by exploiting a homomorphic threshold cryptosystem, together with the bounded Laplace mechanism and the skip list. We perform a detailed security analysis to demonstrate the security properties in terms of privacy preservation and dishonest user detection. In addition, we evaluate and compare the computational efficiency with two traditional schemes, and the simulation results show that our scheme greatly improves the computational efficiency during participant fluctuation. To validate the effectiveness of our scheme, we also show that only part of the model update is excluded from aggregation in the case of a dishonest user.},

  abstract = {With the rapid increase of data, centralized machine learning can no longer meet the application requirements of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). On the one hand, both car owners and regulators pay more attention to data privacy and are unwilling to share data, which forms the isolated data island challenge. On the other hand, the incremental data generated in IoV are massive and diverse. All these issues have brought challenges of data increment and data diversity. The current common federated learning or incremental learning frameworks cannot effectively integrate incremental data with existing machine learning (ML) models. Therefore, this paper proposes a Federated Learning Framework Based on Incremental Weighting and Diversity Selection for IoV (Fed-IW\&DS). In Fed-IW\&DS, a vehicle diversity selection algorithm was proposed, which uses a variety of performance indicators to calculate diversity scores, effectively reducing homogeneous computing. Also, it proposes a vehicle federated incremental algorithm that uses an improved arctangent curve as the decay function, to realize the rapid fusion of incremental data with existing ML models. Moreover, we have carried out several sets of experiments to test the validity of the proposed Fed-IW\&DS framework's performance. The experimental results show that, under the same global communication round and similar computing time, the Fed-IW\&DS framework has significantly improved performance in all aspects compared to the frameworks FED-AVG, FED-SGD, FED-prox \& the decay functions linear, square curve and arc tangent. Specifically, the Fed-IW\&DS framework improves the Acc (accuracy), loss (loss), and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) by approximately 32\%, 83\%, and 66\%, respectively. This result shows that Fed-IW\&DS is a more reliable solution than the common frameworks of federated learning, and it can effectively deal with the dynamic incremental data in the IoV scenario. Our findings should make a significant contribution to the field of federated learning.},

This sequential process is extremely time-consuming and more importantly, knowledge from the fine-tuned model stays local and can not be re-used or leveraged collaboratively. To tackle this problem, we present an online federated RL transfer process for real-time knowledge extraction where all the participant agents make corresponding actions with the knowledge learned by others, even when they are acting in very different environments. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we constructed a real-life collision avoidance system with Microsoft Airsim simulator and NVIDIA JetsonTX2 car agents, which cooperatively learn from scratch to avoid collisions in indoor environment with obstacle objects. We demonstrate that with the proposed framework, the simulator car agents can transfer knowledge to the RC cars in real-time, with 27\% increase in the average distance with obstacles and 42\% decrease in the collision counts.},

  abstract = {In an Internet of Vehicle (IoV) system, federated learning (FL) is a new approach to process real-time vehicle data in a distributed way, which can improve the driving experience and service quality. However, due to the high mobility and uncertainty of vehicles, the existing federated learning protocols are difficult to meet the full requirements from an IoV system, such as efficient resource allocation, high precision learning, and fast convergence of learning algorithm. To solve the above problems, in this paper, we propose a semi-synchronous federated learning (Semi-SynFed) protocol, to improve the performance of machine learning at Internet of Vehicles. In Semi-SynFed, we first select appropriate nodes to participate the aggregation by its computing capacity, network capacity and learning value of training samples. Meanwhile, the dynamic waiting time technique is designed to adjust the server waiting time at each round dynamically, which makes federated learning process work much more efficient. Finally, a dynamic aggregation scheme is designed to aggregate model parameters in an asynchronous way. To evaluate the reliability of Semi-SynFed, we establish a simulation of IoVs based on the real world data. In the comparative experiments, the results show that the Semi-SynFed outperforms the existing federated learning protocols in terms of convergence speed and resource consumption.},

Therefore, these methods do not take into account the user's privacy. In this paper, we present a new approach to learn autonomous driving policy while respecting privacy concerns. We propose a peer-to-peer Deep Federated Learning (DFL) approach to train deep architectures in a fully decentralized manner and remove the need for central orchestration. We design a new Federated Autonomous Driving network (FADNet) that can improve the model stability, ensure convergence, and handle imbalanced data distribution problems while is being trained with federated learning methods. Intensively experimental results on three datasets show that our approach with FADNet and DFL achieves superior accuracy compared with other recent methods. Furthermore, our approach can maintain privacy by not collecting user data to a central server.},

However, existing traffic flow prediction methods based on centralized machine learning need to gather raw data for model training, which involves serious privacy exposure risks. To address these problems, federated learning that shares model updates without exchanging raw data, has recently been introduced as an efficient solution for achieving privacy protection. However, the existing federated learning frameworks are based on a centralized model coordinator that still suffers from severe security challenges, such as a single point of failure. Thereby, a consortium blockchain-based federated learning framework is proposed to enable decentralized, reliable, and secure federated learning without a centralized model coordinator. In the proposed framework, the model updates from distributed vehicles are verified by miners to prevent unreliable model updates and are then stored on the blockchain. In addition, to further protect model privacy on the blockchain, a differential privacy method with a noise-adding mechanism is applied for the blockchain-based federated learning framework. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed schemes can effectively prevent data poisoning attacks and improve the privacy protection of model updates for secure and privacy-preserving traffic flow prediction.},

Therein, the network-wide power consumption of vehicular users (VUEs) is minimized subject to high reliability in terms of probabilistic queuing delays. Using extreme value theory (EVT), a new reliability measure is defined to characterize extreme events pertaining to vehicles' queue lengths exceeding a predefined threshold. To learn these extreme events, assuming they are independently and identically distributed over VUEs, a novel distributed approach based on federated learning (FL) is proposed to estimate the tail distribution of the queue lengths. Considering the communication delays incurred by FL over wireless links, Lyapunov optimization is used to derive the JPRA policies enabling URLLC for each VUE in a distributed manner. The proposed solution is then validated via extensive simulations using a Manhattan mobility model. Simulation results show that FL enables the proposed method to estimate the tail distribution of queues with an accuracy that is close to a centralized solution with up to 79\% reductions in the amount of exchanged data. Furthermore, the proposed method yields up to 60\% reductions of VUEs with large queue lengths, while reducing the average power consumption by two folds, compared to an average queue-based baseline.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose novel approaches using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, aiming at predicting energy demand for electric vehicle (EV) networks. These methods can learn and find the correlation of complex hidden features to improve the prediction accuracy. First, we propose an energy demand learning (EDL)-based prediction solution in which a charging station provider (CSP) gathers information from all charging stations (CSs) and then performs the EDL algorithm to predict the energy demand for the considered area. However, this approach requires frequent data sharing between the CSs and the CSP, thereby driving communication overhead and privacy issues for the EVs and CSs. To address this problem, we propose a federated energy demand learning (FEDL) approach which allows the CSs sharing their information without revealing real datasets. Specifically, the CSs only need to send their trained models to the CSP for processing. In this case, we can significantly reduce the communication overhead and effectively protect data privacy for the EV users. To further improve the effectiveness of the FEDL, we then introduce a novel clustering-based EDL approach for EV networks by grouping the CSs into clusters before applying the EDL algorithms. Through experimental results, we show that our proposed approaches can improve the accuracy of energy demand prediction up to 24.63\% and decrease communication overhead by 83.4\% compared with other baseline machine learning algorithms.},

  abstract = {Heterogeneity across clients in federated learning (FL) usually hinders the optimization convergence and generalization performance when the aggregation of clients' knowledge occurs in the gradient space. For example, clients may differ in terms of data distribution, network latency, input/output space, and/or model architecture, which can easily lead to the misalignment of their local gradients. To improve the tolerance to heterogeneity, we propose a novel federated prototype learning (FedProto) framework in which the clients and server communicate the abstract class prototypes instead of the gradients. FedProto aggregates the local prototypes collected from different clients, and then sends the global prototypes back to all clients to regularize the training of local models. The training on each client aims to minimize the classification error on the local data while keeping the resulting local prototypes sufficiently close to the corresponding global ones. Moreover, we provide a theoretical analysis to the convergence rate of FedProto under non-convex objectives. In experiments, we propose a benchmark setting tailored for heterogeneous FL, with FedProto outperforming several recent FL approaches on multiple datasets.},

  abstract = {In order to use datasets collected from multiple vehicles to train a machine learning model while ensuring vehicle user privacy, federal learning framework was introduced into the Internet of Vehicles. Federated learning is a distributed learning framework. Under the federated learning framework, the packet error rate and wireless bandwidth have a great influence on the global model training process because the vehicle exchanges model parameters with the central server through the wireless channel. With limited bandwidth, the central server needs to select a more appropriate subset of vehicles candidates to participate in federated learning. In this paper, image classification is taken as a typical application in the Internet of vehicles. The dataset contents of different vehicles are different, and the selection of different subsets of vehicles will affect the accuracy and convergence rate of the global model. Therefore, an algorithm of vehicle selection and wireless resource allocation based on dataset content is proposed. Vehicles selection and wireless resource allocation are designed as an optimization problem by joint considerations of vehicle computing resource, datasets, and wireless resources with the goal of maximizing loss function decay of the global model. Finally, simulation with the CIFAR-10 dataset verifies that the vehicle selection and resource allocation algorithm based on the dataset content is superior to the baseline methods in terms of model accuracy and convergence rate.},

This paper proposes a unit-modulus over-the-air computation (UMAirComp) framework to facilitate efficient edge federated learning, which simultaneously uploads local model parameters and updates global model parameters via analog beamforming. The proposed framework avoids sophisticated baseband signal processing, leading to low communication delays and implementation costs. Training loss bounds of UMAirComp FL systems are derived and two low-complexity large-scale optimization algorithms, termed penalty alternating minimization (PAM) and accelerated gradient projection (AGP), are proposed to minimize the nonconvex nonsmooth loss bound. Simulation results show that the proposed UMAirComp framework with PAM algorithm achieves a smaller mean square error of model parameters' estimation, training loss, and test error compared with other benchmark schemes.},

To gather knowledge of rare and occluded instances, federated learning assisted connected autonomous vehicle (FLCAV) has been proposed, which leverages vehicular networks to establish federated deep neural networks (DNNs) from distributed data captured by vehicles and road sensors. Without the need of data aggregation, FLCAV preserves privacy while reducing communication costs compared with conventional centralized learning. However, it is challenging to determine the network resources and road sensor placements for multi-stage training with multi-modal datasets in multi-variant scenarios. This article presents networking and training frameworks for FLCAV perception. Multi-layer graph resource allocation and vehicle-road contrastive sensor placement are proposed to address the network management and sensor deployment problems, respectively. We also develop CarlaFLCAV, a software platform that implements the above system and methods.

Machine learning models are often built from the collected data, to enable the detection, classification, and prediction of future events. Due to bandwidth, storage, and privacy concerns, it is often impractical to send all the data to a centralized location. In this paper, we consider the problem of learning model parameters from data distributed across multiple edge nodes, without sending raw data to a centralized place. Our focus is on a generic class of machine learning models that are trained using gradient-descent based approaches. We analyze the convergence bound of distributed gradient descent from a theoretical point of view, based on which we propose a control algorithm that determines the best trade-off between local update and global parameter aggregation to minimize the loss function under a given resource budget. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated via extensive experiments with real datasets, both on a networked prototype system and in a larger-scale simulated environment. The experimentation results show that our proposed approach performs near to the optimum with various machine learning models and different data distributions.},

To better answer these questions, we propose Motley, a benchmark for personalized federated learning. Motley consists of a suite of cross-device and cross-silo federated datasets from varied problem domains, as well as thorough evaluation metrics for better understanding the possible impacts of personalization. We establish baselines on the benchmark by comparing a number of representative personalized federated learning methods. These initial results highlight strengths and weaknesses of existing approaches, and raise several open questions for the community.

  abstract = {The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) technology into the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has provided smart services for intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs). However, due to gradually upgrading to ICVs, an increasing number of external communications interfaces exposes the invehicle networks (IVNs) to malicious network intrusion. The malicious intruders can take over the compromised ICVs and mediately intrude into the ICVs connected through IoV. Therefore, it is urgent to develop IVN intrusion detection methods for IoV security protection. In this paper, a ConvLSTM-based IVN intrusion detection method is developed by leveraging the periodicity of the network message ID. For training the ConvLSTM model, a federated learning (FL) framework with client selection is proposed. The fundamental FL framework works in the client-server mode. ICVs are the local clients, and mobile edge computing (MEC) servers connected to base stations (BSs) function as the parameter servers. Based on the framework, a proximal policy optimization (PPO)-based federated client selection (FCS) scheme is further developed to optimize the model accuracy and system overhead of federated ConvLSTM model training. Simulations are conducted by the exploitation of real-world IoV scenario settings and IVN datasets. The results indicate that by exploiting the ConvLSTM, the model size and convergence time are dramatically reduced, and the 95\%-beyond detection accuracy is maintained. The results also unveil that the PPO-based FCS scheme outperforms the benchmarks on the convergence rate, model accuracy, and system overhead.},

Although FL has been successfully applied to various domains, including driver monitoring application (DMA) on the internet of vehicles (IoV), its usages still face some open issues, such as data and system heterogeneity, large-scale parallelism communication resources, malicious attacks, and data poisoning. This paper proposes a federated transfer-ordered-personalized learning (FedTOP) framework to address the above problems and test on two real-world datasets with and without system heterogeneity. The performance of the three extensions, transfer, ordered, and personalized, is compared by an ablation study and achieves 92.32\% and 95.96\% accuracy on the test clients of two datasets, respectively. Compared to the baseline, there is a 462\% improvement in accuracy and a 37.46\% reduction in communication resource consumption. The results demonstrate that the proposed FedTOP can be used as a highly accurate, streamlined, privacy-preserving, cybersecurityoriented, personalized framework for DMA.},

  abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms must exploit machine learning (ML) in order to execute various tasks ranging from coordinated trajectory planning to cooperative target recognition. However, due to the lack of continuous connections between the UAV swarm and ground base stations (BSs), using centralized ML will be challenging, particularly when dealing with a large volume of data. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed to implement distributed federated learning (FL) algorithms within a UAV swarm that consists of a leading UAV and several following UAVs. Each following UAV trains a local FL model based on its collected data and then sends this trained local model to the leading UAV who will aggregate the received models, generate a global FL model, and transmit it to followers over the intra-swarm network. To identify how wireless factors, like fading, transmission delay, and UAV antenna angle deviations resulting from wind and mechanical vibrations, impact the performance of FL, a rigorous convergence analysis for FL is performed. Then, a joint power allocation and scheduling design is proposed to optimize the convergence rate of FL while taking into account the energy consumption during convergence and the delay requirement imposed by the swarm's control system. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the FL convergence analysis and show that the joint design strategy can reduce the number of communication rounds needed for convergence by as much as 35\% compared with the baseline design.},

  abstract = {In recent years, with the development of computation capability in devices, companies are eager to investigate and utilize suitable ML/DL methods to improve their service quality. However, with the traditional learning strategy, companies need to first build up a powerful data center to collect and analyze data from the edge and then perform centralized model training, which turns out to be inefficient. Federated Learning has been introduced to solve this challenge. Because of its characteristics such as model-only exchange and parallel training, the technique can not only preserve user data privacy but also accelerate model training speed. The method can easily handle real-time data generated from the edge without taking up a lot of valuable network transmission resources. In this paper, we introduce an approach to end-to-end on-device Machine Learning by utilizing Federated Learning. We validate our approach with an important industrial use case in the field of autonomous driving vehicles, the wheel steering angle prediction. Our results show that Federated Learning can significantly improve the quality of local edge models and also reach the same accuracy level as compared to the traditional centralized Machine Learning approach without its negative effects. Furthermore, Federated Learning can accelerate model training speed and reduce the communication overhead, which proves that this approach has great strength when deploying ML/DL components to various real-world embedded systems.},

  abstract = {With the development and the increasing interests in ML/DL fields, companies are eager to apply Machine Learning/Deep Learning approaches to increase service quality and customer experience. Federated Learning was implemented as an effective model training method for distributing and accelerating time-consuming model training while protecting user data privacy. However, common Federated Learning approaches, on the other hand, use a synchronous protocol to conduct model aggregation, which is inflexible and unable to adapt to rapidly changing environments and heterogeneous hardware settings in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present an approach to real-time end-to-end Federated Learning combined with a novel asynchronous model aggregation protocol. Our method is validated in an industrial use case in the automotive domain, focusing on steering wheel angle prediction for autonomous driving. Our findings show that asynchronous Federated Learning can significantly improve the prediction performance of local edge models while maintaining the same level of accuracy as centralized machine learning. Furthermore, by using a sliding training window, the approach can minimize communication overhead, accelerate model training speed and consume real-time streaming data, proving high efficiency when deploying ML/DL components to heterogeneous real-world embedded systems.},

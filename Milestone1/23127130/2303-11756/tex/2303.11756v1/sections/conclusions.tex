In this paper, we present a novel approach to estimate latent representations of the road surface. The latent representation is aggregated to a global grid map, which is then leveraged to improve future state predictions from a dynamics model.
To this end, an ensemble of probabilistic dynamics models estimates the distribution of the next state given the current state, current action, and the latent representation of the road that corresponds to the current position of the vehicle. Thus, our dynamics model can effectively leverage the latent cues making it surface-aware. We show the efficacy of our method on a newly proposed dataset, presenting improved prediction accuracy of future states. Furthermore, we employ a model predictive controller and a novel reward function. In real-world driving experiments we demonstrate that including the latent mapping provides a significantly improved driving performance, reducing lap times and enhancing vehicle safety on surfaces with varying friction.
While this work considers the use of surface information to improve the dynamics model, there are also other changing factors influencing the dynamics such as tire pressure and temperature. 
A promising avenue of future work is to integrate our approach in a more complete system with additional sensors to also take these factors into account.

    "abstract": "Automatic target sound extraction (TSE) is a machine learning approach to mimic the human auditory perception capability of attending to a sound source of interest from a mixture of sources. It often uses a model conditioned on a fixed form of target sound clues, such as a sound class label, which limits the ways in which users can interact with the model to specify the target sounds. To leverage variable number of clues cross modalities available in the inference phase, including a video, a sound event class, and a text caption, we propose a unified transformer-based TSE model architecture, where a multi-clue attention module integrates all the clues across the modalities. Since there is no off-the-shelf benchmark to evaluate our proposed approach, we build a dataset based on public corpora, Audioset and AudioCaps. Experimental results for seen and unseen target-sound evaluation sets show that our proposed TSE model can effectively deal with a varying number of clues which improves the TSE performance and robustness against partially compromised clues.",

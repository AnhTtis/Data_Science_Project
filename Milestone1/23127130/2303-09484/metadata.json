    "abstract": "Patient outcome prediction is critical in management of ischemic stroke. In this paper, a novel machine learning model is proposed for stroke outcome prediction using multimodal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The proposed model consists of two serial levels of Autoencoders (AEs), where different AEs at level 1 are used for learning unimodal features from different MRI modalities and a AE at level 2 is used to combine the unimodal features into compressed multimodal features. The sequences of multimodal features of a given patient are then used by an LSTM network for predicting outcome score. The proposed AE2-LSTM model is proved to be an effective approach for better addressing the multimodality and volumetric nature of MRI data. Experimental results show that the proposed AE2-LSTM outperforms the existing state-of-the art models by achieving highest AUC=0.71 and lowest MAE=0.34.",

% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing roug breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmatrou to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{algorithmic}
\algsetup{linenosize=\small}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the sr Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.


\newcommand{\notered}[1]{\textcolor{red}{[{{\bf #1}}]}}

% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for

% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url

\begin{abstract}
Federated edge learning can be essential in supporting privacy-preserving, artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled activities in digital twin 6G-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) environments. However, we need to also consider the potential of attacks targeting the underlying AI systems (e.g., adversaries seek to corrupt data on the IoT devices during local updates or corrupt the model updates); hence, in this article, we propose an anticipatory study for poisoning attacks in federated edge learning for digital twin 6G-enabled IoT environments. Specifically, we study the influence of adversaries on the training and development of federated learning models in digital twin 6G-enabled IoT environments. We demonstrate that attackers can carry out poisoning attacks in two different learning settings, namely: centralized learning and federated learning, and successful attacks can severely reduce the model's accuracy. We comprehensively evaluate the attacks on a new cyber security dataset designed for IoT applications with three deep neural networks under the non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data and the independent and identically distributed (IID) data. The poisoning attacks, on an attack classification problem, can lead to a decrease in accuracy from $94.93$\% to $85.98$\% with IID data and from $94.18$\% to $30.04$\% with Non-IID.

\section{Introduction}
%--------------------------------

The emergence of the digital twin (DT) paradigm with 6G wireless communication networks is being viewed to transform applications and customer services through the Internet of Things (IoT) to fully autonomous and smart systems \cite{naser2022toward}. The main idea behind DT is to build a digital replication of wireless networks' physical devices and features to achieve low latency and highly reliable connectivity while providing high performance and energy efficiency in IoT networks. The architecture of digital twin 6G-enabled IoT can be organized into four layers, namely, Physical, Networking, Services, and Applications. The physical layer refers to IoT devices equipped with sensors and actuators for collecting data from the environment. The networking layer refers to DT services, telecommunication networks (6G), IEEE 802.15.4, long-range WiFi, and communication protocols to connect IoT devices with other operators and system components. The Ditto \footnote{https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/} can be used as IoT middleware, supporting an IoT abstraction level for interacting IoT solutions with physical devices via the digital twin model. The services layer provides AI, storage, computation, and services to IoT devices and Edge servers~\cite{9939166}. The applications layer refers to IoT applications, including the Internet of Vehicles, the Internet of Sensing, and the Internet of Energy...etc.

%The approaches behind advanced artificial intelligence systems are consistently vulnerable to a new category of cybersecurity attacks called ''AI Attacks''~\cite{comiter2019attacking}. Through this attack, adversaries can exploit and manipulate the IoT systems to modify the behavior to achieve a malicious end objective. 

%As AI systems are more fully implemented in society's critical components (i.e.,6G-enabled IoTs), these AI attacks become a significant potential emerging cyber security vulnerability for the countries. The poisoning attacks are a sub-field of AI attacks, broadly classified into the adversarial attack and poisoning attack~\cite{liu2021adversarial}. 

With distributed edge learning, intrusion poisoning attacks pose an even more severe challenge than the conventional machine learning environment (i.e., centralized learning). However, the threat of intrusion poisoning attacks can be challenging to overcome, as they can be difficult to identify. Nevertheless, the availability of intrusion poisoning attacks has been proven to be efficient in distributed edge learning in the following recent work:~\cite{severi2022network,zhang2022secfednids,venkatesan2021poisoning,aiken2019investigating,pawlicki2020defending,liu2021adversarial}. Zhang et al. \cite{zhang2022secfednids} proposed a defense mechanism at the model level, which is mainly based on the detection of a poisoned model. More precisely, the proposed mechanism uses the model's important parameter selection method based on the gradient to deliver the lowest dimensional efficient performances of the local model parameters downloaded.  Venkatesan et al. \cite{venkatesan2021poisoning} considered the poisoning availability attack framework, where an attacker can introduce a set of poisonous samples during training to degrade the deployed model's accuracy. Aiken et al.~\cite{aiken2019investigating} proposed an IDS system based on an anomaly. The proposed system uses a tool for adversarial testing named Hydra,  which measures the influence of the threat of adversarial evasion classifier attacks against the network intrusion detection system to reduce the detection rate of malicious network traffic.

Motivated by the facts mentioned above, in this article, we propose an anticipatory study for poisoning attacks in federated edge learning for digital twin 6G-enabled IoTs. Specifically, we demonstrate that attackers who conduct poisoning attacks in two different learning modes, namely, centralized learning and federated learning, can severely reduce the model's accuracy and the detection rate of each intrusion. We comprehensively evaluate our attacks on a new cyber security dataset designed for IoT applications, the Edge-IIoT dataset. We use different deep-learning models for cyber security intrusion detection. Furthermore, federated edge learning is evaluated under two data distribution types: IID and Non-IID data. The study demonstrates that attackers who conduct poisoning attacks in two different learning modes, namely, centralized learning and federated learning,  can lead to a decrease in accuracy from 94.93\% to 85.98\% with IID data and from 94.18\% to 30.04\% with Non-IID. 

%\notered{What is our finding, and how can we highlight the contribution of this work quantitatively in one sentence? I usually call this the "wow factor" of a research paper under review.}

%\notered{I think it would be safer to present this study from an "anticipatory" angle. It should not sound like "proposing an attack". My suggestd changes are based on this rationale.}

\section{The Anticipated Poisoning Attack on the Federated Edge Learning}
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

%\notered{We may need a brief preamble here to explain what is being aimed by this anticipatory work.}

%-----------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Description of the Anticipated Poisoning Attack}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------

We systemize the poisoning threat models in federated edge learning based on three dimensions: Adversarial goal, Attack strategies, and Malicious client selection.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Adversarial goal}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------

An attacker can focus on two types of poisoning attacks: a machine learning attack against availability (i.e., target all classes) and a machine learning attack against a particular class. Since the targeted attacks are considerably challenging to detect, we consider a Poisoning attack as a targeted attack against cyber security intrusion detection based on federated learning. Specifically, the Normal class is considered as a particular class, which is affected by the attack rate $\alpha$ $= [0\%, 40\%, 50\%, 60\%, 80\%]$. The attack rate $\alpha$ $= 60\%$ means that 60\% of Normal traffic is labeled as an attack.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Attack strategies}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------

The attacker can conduct poisoning attacks (i.e.,  Label flipping attack, Targeted dropping attack, and Clean-label attack) in two types of learning methods: centralized learning and federated learning. In centralized learning mode, an attacker is considered to have access to the training dataset of the server using a backdoor attack. Then, it injects maliciously crafted data points containing normal IoT traffic labeled an attack class. In the federated learning mode, some malicious clients contain maliciously crafted data points, which send malicious updates to the server to change the model’s prediction. The generation of poison attacks in federated edge learning is presented in Algorithms \ref{alg:alg1}, \ref{alg:alg2}, \ref{alg:alg3}, and can be defined by the following steps. Table \ref{tab:notation} presents the notations used.

\begin{itemize}
\item Step 1: The Edge server initializes the first model $f_{1}$.

\item Step 2: The Edge server distributes the overall model $f_{t+1}$ to honest clients $K_H$ and malicious clients $K_M$.

\item Step 3: The malicious clients $K_M$ identify the best clients based on the average loss change through a backdoor attack.

\item Step 4: The malicious clients $K_M$ generate the targeted class samples and insert poison data into the local dataset.

\item Step 5: The malicious clients $K_M$ assign wrong label to poisoned data.

\item Step 6: The malicious clients $K_M$ start the targeted client dropping attack using DDoS attacks.

\item Step 7: The malicious clients $K_M$ calculate the poisoned update and it to the Edge server.
\end{itemize}

%----------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Malicious clients selection}
%----------------------------------------------------

We consider an intelligent attacker for the selectively honest client (i.e., to be malicious) to attack the federated edge learning to ensure maximum attack strength while simultaneously reducing the probability of detection. Based on the backdoor attack, this attacker can access the machine learning models located at the Edge server. The attacker has the following choices to consider: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item When to start the attack during the FL process? we found that the success of the poisoning attack is severe when the attackers control more than 51\% of the clients.
    \item What the knowledge of the attacker is? The threat model is a white box attack if the attacker has full knowledge of parameters, algorithms, data, and features. If he has only query access to the model, the threat model is a black box attack. We found that the success of the poisoning attack is severe under the white box attack. 
    \item Which honest clients to select to inject maliciously crafted data points containing normal IoT traffic labeled as an attack class? we found that the more attackers select early the best clients (i.e., who provides the best learning model), the more poisoning attack severe.
    \item How much local data to drop or inject for each client to maximize the entire global model corruption at the edge server? We found that it depends on the analysis of the local data for each client. 
    \item What is the best assignment strategy for assigning wrong labels? The assignment strategy can be implemented in various ways such as dropping, shuffling, swapping, and sliding. After several experiments, we found that the assignment strategy of the wrong label based on swapping affects more the distributed edge learning compared to others strategies.
\end{itemize}



%\notered{Instead of step by step listing; does it make sense to have a figure partitioned into three, and each partition presents a flowchart of a different deep learning network, i.e., DNN, RNN, CNN}

We use three different deep-learning models for intrusion detection, namely, DNN, RNN, and CNN. The architectures of three deep neural models adopted by the intrusion detection are illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:fig11}.

\section{Experimental Evaluation}
\label{sec:6}
%----------------------------------------------------------

%----------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Experimental setup}
%----------------------------------------------------------

We conducted an experimental analysis of poisoning attacks against intrusion detection systems based on deep learning approaches in centralized and federated learning. We choose three deep learning approaches: DNN, CNN, and RNN. The classification tasks are conducted in two modes: Binary classification and Multi-class classification. The Binary classification includes two classes (i.e., Normal or Attack). The Multi-class classification includes 15 classes (i.e., Normal or attack types). We use Google Colab with Python libraries to analyze and visualize data. To build, train, and evaluate poisoning models, we use both open-source frameworks, namely, Keras and PyTorch. We adopt both the IID and Non-IID data distribution in federated learning.  Table~\ref{tab:tab12} presents the details of settings for experimental evaluation.

%----------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Dataset description and pre-processing}
%----------------------------------------------------------

We use the Edge-IIoTset dataset \cite{ferrag2022edge}, a new comprehensive, realistic cyber security dataset. The Edge-IIoTset dataset is generated using a purpose-built IoT/IIoT testbed. The testbed consists of seven interconnected layers: IoT/IIoT perception layer, edge layer, SDN layer, fog layer, Blockchain layer, NFV layer, and cloud computing layer. It contains more than 20 million total instances for normal and attacks traffic in CSV and PCAP files, with over 63 features. The pre-processing data phases are organized into the following seven steps: 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Clean corrupted and duplicated rows.
    \item Clean unnecessary columns (features), especially for avoiding overfitting.
    \item Encode categorical features as a one-hot numeric array using the $OneHotEncoder()$ function.
    \item Split the dataset into random train (80\%) and test (20\%) subsets. 
    \item Standardize features using the $StandardScaler()$ function.
    \item Perform oversampling using SMOTE \footnote{To oversample data in minority classes while avoiding overfitting, we use the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). }.
    \item Give a new shape to an array without changing its data, which is used for RNN and CNN\footnote{The reason for reshaping is to provide the correct data to the CNN and RNN models using the numpy.reshape() function. }.
\end{enumerate}

%\notered{I'm not sure what giving a new shape to a vector means?}
% Mohamed : The reason for reshaping is to ensure that the input data to the model is in the correct shape. please see the following link https://towardsdatascience.com/get-into-shape-14637fe1cd32
%Burak: Ok, I did suspect that. They call it reshaping. From an algeabric standpoint, this is mainly for matching dimensions. 

%----------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Performance Metrics}
%----------------------------------------------------------

In order to evaluate the performance of machine learning models, we use the following important performance metrics:
%\notered{There are some metrics to evaluate adversarial ML schemes. Such as evasion increase ration... Do you think we should also include some other metrics other than the classical ML performance metrics? You ay like to check Table III in https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9653662 }
%\notered{Instead of explaning like this; can we give a visualized descriptions, which will be more intuitive and reader friendly? I have made acompsketch of what I'm thinking of, please see below. Up to you...}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{True Positive (TP)}: correctly classified attack samples.
    \item \textit{False Negative (FN)}: wrongly classified attack samples.
    \item \textit{True Negative (TN)}: correctly classified benign samples.
    \item \textit{False Positive (FP)}: wrongly classified benign samples.
    \item \textit{Accuracy}, given by: $ \frac{TP_{Attack}+TN_{Normal}}{TP_{Attack}+TN_{Normal}+FP_{Normal}+FN_{Attack}}$
    \item \textit{Precision}, given by: $\frac{TP_{Attack}}{TP_{Attack} + FP_{Normal}}$
    \item \textit{Recall}, given by: $ \frac{TP_{Attack}}{TP_{Attack} + FN_{Attack}}$
    \item \textit{$F_{1}$-Score}, given by: $2 \cdot \frac{Precision \cdot Recall}{Precision+Recall}$
    \item \textit{Poisoning attack rate}: is used to measure the success of the poisoning attack for each label, which is given by: $1-\frac{Recall_{wp}}{Recall_{wop}}$

%\notered{We may need to check the terminology. This equation defines the Attack Severity (AS) parameter $\rightarrow$ $AS = 1 - \frac{Recall_{AfterAttack}}{Recall_{Before Attack}}$}
% Mohamed: it is the same. Its like recall and detection rate.
%It's the same but I meant should we stick with Poisoning attack rate or call it Poisoning Attack Severity?
   
\end{itemize}

 \noindent where $Recall_{wp}$ is the detection rate of the intrusion attack after the poisoning attack and $Recall_{wop}$ is the detection rate of the intrusion attack before the poisoning attack.

 
 %\notered{The data seems to be quite imbalanced. One way to evaluate such performances under highly imbalanced sets is to use the G-Mean score.  $G-Mean=\sqrt{TPR*TNR}$ I don't know if we would have any space or should we leave it to future work?}
      %  \end{equation}
       
    %\item \textit{Recall}: denotes the proportion of proper attack classifications relative to the overall count of all samples that ought to have been identified as attacks, which is given by :
    %    \begin{equation}\label{eq:eq12}
    %         Recall  = \frac{TP_{Attack}}{TP_{Attack} + FN_{Attack}}
    %    \end{equation}
    
    % \item \textit{Precision}: denotes the proportion of correct attack classes to the total amount of predicted attack results, which can be given by :
     %    \begin{equation}\label{eq:eq11}
      %       Precision =\frac{TP_{Attack}}{TP_{Attack} + FP_{Normal}}
     %   \end{equation}
       
     % \item $F_{1}$-Score: reports the Halec Mean between Precision and Recall, which is given by:
     %  \begin{equation}\label{eq:eq13}
      %       F_1-Score = 2 \cdot \frac{Precision \cdot Recall}{Precision+Recall}
      %  \end{equation}
       
     %  \item\textit{Accuracy}: is used to determine the proportion of correct classifications to the total number of entries, which is given by :
      %   \begin{equation}\label{eq:eq10}
      %    Acc =  \frac{TP_{Attack}+TN_{Normal}}{TP_{Attack}+TN_{Normal}+FP_{Normal}+FN_{Attack}}
      %  \end{equation}
      % \item\textit{Poisoning attack rate}: is used to measure the success of the poisoning attack for each label, which is given by :
      % \begin{equation}\label{eq:eq10}
      %    PAR =  1-\frac{Recall_{wp}}{Recall_{wop}}
      %  \end{equation}
       
       % Where $Recall_{wp}$ is the detection rate of the intrusion attack after poisoning attack and $Recall_{wop}$ is the detection rate of the intrusion attack before poisoning attack. A true positive (TP) is a score in which the model predicts the positive class properly. In the same direction, a true negative (TN) is a result when the model predicts properly the negative class. A false positive (FP) is a result when the model predicts the positive class incorrectly, while a false negative (FN) is a result when the model predicts the negative class incorrectly.

\subsection{Experimental Results}
%----------------------------------------------------------

%----------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Centralized model performance}
%----------------------------------------------------------

Table~\ref{tab:tab9} presents the classification report of the accuracy of deep learning for binary classification and multi-classification under different deep learning approaches, namely, DNN, RNN, and CNN in centralized model performance with the attack rate $\alpha$ $= [0\%, 40\%, 50\%, 60\%]$ (i.e., Poisoning Attack). With binary classification, the accuracy of the DNN classifier is decreased from 100\% to 95.50\%, while with multi-classification, the accuracy is decreased from 93.01\% to 21.76\%. We observe that intrusion detection models based on the deep learning classifiers (i.e., CNN, RNN, DNN) are more affected by multi-classification than binary classification.


Table \ref{tab:tab8} presents the classification report for a multi-class of different deep learning approaches, namely, DNN, RNN, and CNN in centralized model performance with the attack rate $\alpha$ $= 60\%$ (i.e., Poisoning Attack). We observe that the DNN gives the highest precision rate without poisoning attack (i.e., $\alpha$ $= 0\%$) for Normal traffic and three types of attacks, namely, MITM attack 100\%, Password attack 69\%, and XSS attack 100\%. In addition, we observe that the CNN gives the highest precision rate for Normal traffic and three types of attacks: SQL injection attack 64\%, Vulnerability scanner attack 94\%, and XSS attack 100\%.


Figure~\ref{fig:fig10} illustrates the confusion matrix of DNN for binary classification in centralized model performance without poisoning attack $\alpha$ $= 0\%$, with Poisoning Attack $\alpha$ $= 60\%$ and $\alpha$ $= 80\%$, and learning rate LR = [0.1, 0.01, 0.001]. Without poisoning attack (i.e., $\alpha$ $= 0\%$), we observe satisfactory results under the three values of the learning rate LR = [0.1, 0.01, 0.001]. When attackers launch a Poisoning Attack with $\alpha$ $= 60\%$ and $\alpha$ $= 80\%$, we observe that all the DNN classifier is affected and give negative results under the three values of the learning rate LR = [0.1, 0.01, 0.001]. In addition, we observe that when the learning rate is fixed at 0.1, the DNN classifier can resist the Poisoning Attack compared to the results with the learning rate is 0.01 and 0.001.

%----------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Federated model performance}
%----------------------------------------------------------

Table \ref{tab:tab9} presents the accuracy results of the federated deep learning approach (CNN) for binary classification and multi-classification in federated model performance with the IID data and different numbers of honest clients $K_h$ and malicious clients $K_m$. When the number of honest clients is higher than the number of malicious clients (i.e., [$K_h=10$ and $K_m=0$], [$K_h=7$ and $K_m=3$]), we can observe that in each round, the accuracy results increases until it reaches 94.93\% and 100\% with multi-classification and binary classification, respectively. Therefore, when the number of honest clients is less than the number of malicious clients (i.e., $K_h=3$ and $K_m=7$), we can observe that the accuracy results are affected in each round and give negative results until it reaches 85.98\% with multi-classification. 

Table \ref{tab:tab10} presents the accuracy results of the federated deep learning approach (CNN) for binary classification and multi-classification in federated model performance with the Non-IID data and different numbers of honest clients $K_h$ and malicious clients $K_m$. When the number of honest clients is less than the number of malicious clients (i.e., $K_h=3$ and $K_m=7$), we can observe that in each round, the accuracy results are affected in each round and give negative results until it reaches 30.04\%.

Table \ref{tab:tab11} presents the evaluation results of the federated deep learning approach (CNN) for multi-classification in federated model performance with the IID and Non-IID data and different numbers of honest clients $K_h$ and malicious clients $K_m$.  with a poisoning attack (i.e., $\alpha$ $= 60\%$) and the number of honest clients is less than the number of malicious clients (i.e., $K_h=3$ and $K_m=7$), we observe that the CNN classifier is affected and give negative results with the three performance metrics, namely, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Figure \ref{fig:fig2} presents the evaluation results of poisoning attack rate(\%) in two different learning modes, namely, (a) federated model performance under two data distribution types, namely, IID and Non-IID data; (b) centralized model performance with DNN, RNN, and CNN models. The numbers of honest clients $K_h=3$ and malicious clients $K_m=7$. With the federated edge learning setting, we observe the success of the poisoning attack up to 100\% for some classes, which means that the malicious IoT devices have disturbed the privacy-preserving federated learning in both IID and Non-IID modes. The results we observe for the centralized learning settings are, as we would expect, the success of the poisoning attack up to 100\% for the Normal class.

%----------------------------------------------------------
\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:8}
%----------------------------------------------------------

We have proposed an anticipatory study for poisoning attacks in federated edge learning for digital twin 6G-enabled IoTs. We examined the influence of adversaries on the training and development of federated learning models for digital twin 6G-enabled IoTs. We demonstrated that attackers who conduct poisoning attacks in two different learning modes, namely, centralized learning and federated learning, can severely reduce the model's accuracy. We comprehensively evaluated our attacks on a new cyber security dataset designed for IoT applications. The study demonstrates that attackers who conduct poisoning attacks can lead to a decrease in accuracy from 94.93\% to 85.98\% with IID data and from 94.18\% to 30.04\% with Non-IID data. 


%\notered{We need a solid concluding statement, which may probably highlight a remarkable quantitative aspect out of the numerical results. }

Since we envision the possibility that attackers will use generative AI to create adversarial samples, our ongoing research agenda includes building efficient approaches to defend against such attacks. Additionally, the protection of the integrity of the data as well as the integrity of the AI model in the federated edge learning models for digital twin 6G-enabled IoTs is also on our radar. 


%\notered{I reformulated the future directions a little bit. Please see if you agree.}

%\textcolor{red}{shall we point to some directions?}

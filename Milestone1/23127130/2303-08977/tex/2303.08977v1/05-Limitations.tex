\section{Limitations}
\label{Sec:Limitations}
DeblurSR assumes that the scene has a simple texture. The piece-wise linear function used by the spiking representation cannot accurately approximate the temporal evolution of complex textures. On the REDS~\cite{Nah_2019_CVPR_Workshops_REDS} and the HQF~\cite{stoffregen2020reducing} datasets, we observe that DeblurSR has robust performance across various real-world scenes. However, we point out that it is possible to design an artificial pattern where the pixel intensities change nonlinearly with time.

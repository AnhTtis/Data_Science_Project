    "abstract": "Test flakiness is a problem that affects testing and processes that rely on it. Several factors cause or influence the flakiness of test outcomes. Test execution order, randomness and concurrency are some of the more common and well-studied causes. Some studies mention code instrumentation as a factor that causes or affects test flakiness. However, evidence for this issue is scarce. In this study, we attempt to systematically collect evidence for the effects of instrumentation on test flakiness. We experiment with common types of instrumentation for Java programs - namely, application performance monitoring, coverage and profiling instrumentation. We then study the effects of instrumentation on a set of nine programs obtained from an existing dataset used to study test flakiness, consisting of popular GitHub projects written in Java. We observe cases where real-world instrumentation causes flakiness in a program. However, this effect is rare. We also discuss a related issue - how instrumentation may interfere with flakiness detection and prevention.",

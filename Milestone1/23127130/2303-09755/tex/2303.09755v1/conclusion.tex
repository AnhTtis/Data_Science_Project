\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

In this paper, we discuss the possible impact of instrumentation on the presence of flakiness in test suites. We hypothesised that instrumentation does have an impact on the presence or frequency of flaky tests. To investigate this, we conducted an experiment using five Java instrumentation tools representing three different instrumentation types (APM, coverage and profiling). Our results from studying nine open-source programs show that instrumentation has little to no effect on the presence or frequency of flaky tests (i.e., it does not increase flakiness). These are preliminary results, and a more comprehensive study is needed. In the future, we plan to extend this study to include a more significant number of instrumentation tools and to study programs with a larger number of reruns.

However, obtaining equilibrium crystal structures typically requires expensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which limits ML-based exploration to either known crystals or a small number of hypothetical crystals. Here, we demonstrate that the application of Bayesian optimization with symmetry constraints using a graph deep learning energy model can be used to perform “DFT-free” relaxations of crystal structures. Using this approach to significantly improve the accuracy of ML-predicted formation energies and elastic moduli of hypothetical crystals, two novel ultra-incompressible hard MoWC2 (P63/mmc) and ReWB (Pca21) were identified and successfully synthesized via in situ reactive spark plasma sintering from screening 399,960 transition metal borides and carbides. This work addresses a critical bottleneck to accurate property predictions for hypothetical materials, paving the way to ML-accelerated discovery of new materials with exceptional properties.},

Thanks to the KED ingredient, meta-GGA functionals can satisfy different exact constraints for XC energy and can be made one-electron self-correlation free. This leads to a better accuracy over a wider range of properties with respect to GGAs, often reaching the accuracy of hybrid functionals, but at much reduced computational cost. An extensive survey of the relevant literature on existing KED dependent XC functionals is provided, considering nonempirical, semi-empirical, and fully empirical ones. A deeper analysis and a wide benchmark are presented for functionals derived considering only exact constraints and parameters obtained from model and/or atomic systems.},

Via the adiabatic connection formula, we define a hypercorrelated potential whose virial is exactly the correlation energy. This exchange-correlation energy density is uniquely determined by the exchange-correlation energy functiional. We calculate the virial energy density both exactly and within several popular functionals, LDA, PBE, and BLYP, on several atoms. The well-known differences between the potentials generated by these functionals is reflected in this energy density. We speculate on how accurately the correlation energy can be estimated from knowledge of the exact density, and on the construction of an energy density hybrid.},

To efficiently solve for the embedding potential, an optimized effective potential method is derived. This embedding potential, which eschews use of approximate kinetic energy density functionals, is then used to describe the environment while a correlated wavefunction (CW) treatment of the embedded region is employed. We first demonstrate the accuracy of this new embedded CW (ECW) method by calculating the van der Waals binding energy curve between a hydrogen molecule and a hydrogen chain. We then examine the prototypical adsorption of CO on a metal surface, here the Cu(111) surface. In addition to obtaining proper site ordering (top site most stable) and binding energies within this theory, the ECW exhibits dramatic changes in the p -character of the CO 4σ and 5σ orbitals upon adsorption that agree very well with x-ray emission spectra, providing further validation of the theory. Finally, we generalize our embedding theory to spin-polarized quantum systems and discuss the connection between our theory and partition density functional theory.},

The appearance of nonadditive kinetic energy contributions in this context poses significant challenges, but using optimized effective potential (OEP) methods, various groups have devised DFT-in-DFT methods that are equivalent to Kohn-Sham (KS) theory on the whole system. This being the case, we note that a very considerable simplification arises from doing KS theory instead. We then describe embedding schemes that enforce Pauli exclusion via a projection technique, completely avoiding numerically demanding OEP calculations. Illustrative applications are presented using DFT-in-DFT, wave-function-in-DFT, and wave-function-in-Hartree-Fock embedding, and using an embedded many-body expansion.},

abstract = { The nature of the Maxwell–Cartesian spherical harmonics S (n) K and their relation to tesseral harmonics Y nm is examined with the help of “tricorn arrays” that display the components of a totally symmetric Cartesian tensor of any rank in a systematic way. The arrays show the symmetries of the Maxwell–Cartesian harmonic tensors with respect to permutation of axes, the traceless properties of the tensors, the linearly independent subsets, the nonorthogonal subsets, and the subsets whose linear combinations produce the tesseral harmonics. The two families of harmonics are related by their connection with the gradients of 1/ r , and explicit formulas for the transformation coefficients are derived. The rotational transformation of S (n) K functions is described by a relatively simple Cartesian tensor method. The utility of the Maxwell–Cartesian harmonics in the theory of multipole potentials, where these functions originated in the work of Maxwell, is illustrated with some newer applications which employ a detracer exchange theorem and make use of the partial linear independence of the functions. The properties of atomic orbitals whose angular part is described by Maxwell–Cartesian harmonics are explored, including their angular momenta, adherence to an Unsöld-type spherical symmetry relation, and potential for eliminating an angular momentum “contamination” problem in Cartesian Gaussian basis sets.},

abstract = {Translating or rotating an input image should not affect the results of many computer vision tasks. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are already translation equivariant: input image translations produce proportionate feature map translations. This is not the case for rotations. Global rotation equivariance is typically sought through data augmentation, but patch-wise equivariance is more difficult. We present Harmonic Networks or H-Nets, a CNN exhibiting equivariance to patch-wise translation and 360-rotation. We achieve this by replacing regular CNN filters with circular harmonics, returning a maximal response and orientation for every receptive field patch. H-Nets use a rich, parameter-efficient and low computational complexity representation, and we show that deep feature maps within the network encode complicated rotational invariants. We demonstrate that our layers are general enough to be used in conjunction with the latest architectures and techniques, such as deep supervision and batch normalization. We also achieve state-of-the-art classification on rotated-MNIST, and competitive results on other benchmark challenges.},

abstract = {Convolutional neural networks have been extremely successful in the image recognition domain because they ensure equivariance to translations. There have been many recent attempts to generalize this framework to other domains, including graphs and data lying on manifolds. In this paper we give a rigorous, theoretical treatment of convolution and equivariance in neural networks with respect to not just translations, but the action of any compact group. Our main result is to prove that (given some natural constraints) convolutional structure is not just a sufficient, but also a necessary condition for equivariance to the action of a compact group. Our exposition makes use of concepts from representation theory and noncommutative harmonic analysis and derives new generalized convolution formulae.},

abstract = {As the second component of SPARC (Simulation Package for Ab-initio Real-space Calculations), we present an accurate and efficient finite-difference formulation and parallel implementation of Density Functional Theory (DFT) for extended systems. Specifically, employing a local formulation of the electrostatics, the Chebyshev polynomial filtered self-consistent field iteration, and a reformulation of the non-local force component, we develop a finite-difference framework wherein both the energy and atomic forces can be efficiently calculated to within desired accuracies in DFT. We demonstrate using a wide variety of materials systems that SPARC achieves high convergence rates in energy and forces with respect to spatial discretization to reference plane-wave result; exponential convergence in energies and forces with respect to vacuum size for slabs and wires; energies and forces that are consistent and display negligible ‘egg-box’ effect; accurate properties of crystals, slabs, and wires; and negligible drift in molecular dynamics simulations. We also demonstrate that the weak and strong scaling behavior of SPARC is similar to well-established and optimized plane-wave implementations for systems consisting up to thousands of electrons, but with a significantly reduced prefactor. Overall, SPARC represents an attractive alternative to plane-wave codes for performing DFT simulations of extended systems.

   functional theory (DFT) calculations is presented. The use of uniform
   three-dimensional (3D) real-space grids for representing wave
   functions, densities, and potentials allows for flexible boundary
   conditions, efficient multigrid algorithms for solving Poisson and
   Kohn-Sham equations, and efficient parallelization using simple
   real-space domain-decomposition. We use the PAW method to perform
   all-electron calculations in the frozen core approximation, with smooth
   valence wave functions that can be represented on relatively coarse
   grids. We demonstrate the accuracy of the method by calculating the
   atomization energies of 20 small molecules, and the bulk modulus and
   lattice constants of bulk aluminum. We show that the approach in terms
   of computational efficiency is comparable to standard plane-wave
   methods, but the memory requirements are higher.},

abstract = {<p><p>This paper develops the multidimensional binary search tree (or <italic>k</italic>-d tree, where <italic>k</italic> is the dimensionality of the search space) as a data structure for storage of information to be retrieved by associative searches. The <italic>k</italic>-d tree is defined and examples are given. It is shown to be quite efficient in its storage requirements. A significant advantage of this structure is that a single data structure can handle many types of queries very efficiently. Various utility algorithms are developed; their proven average running times in an <italic>n</italic> record file are: insertion, <italic>O</italic>(log <italic>n</italic>); deletion of the root, <italic>O</italic>(<italic>n</italic><supscrpt>(<italic>k</italic>-1)/<italic>k</italic></supscrpt>); deletion of a random node, <italic>O</italic>(log <italic>n</italic>); and optimization (guarantees logarithmic performance of searches), <italic>O</italic>(<italic>n</italic> log <italic>n</italic>).

abstract = {We present a hybrid neural-network for human face recognition which compares favourably with other methods. The system combines local image sampling, a self-organizing map (SOM) neural network, and a convolutional neural network. The SOM provides a quantization of the image samples into a topological space where inputs that are nearby in the original space are also nearby in the output space, thereby providing dimensionality reduction and invariance to minor changes in the image sample, and the convolutional neural network provides partial invariance to translation, rotation, scale, and deformation. The convolutional network extracts successively larger features in a hierarchical set of layers. We present results using the Karhunen-Loeve transform in place of the SOM, and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) in place of the convolutional network for comparison. We use a database of 400 images of 40 individuals which contains quite a high degree of variability in expression, pose, and facial details. We analyze the computational complexity and discuss how new classes could be added to the trained recognizer.},

abstract = {KohnSham density functionals are widely used; however, no currently available exchangecorrelation functional can predict all chemical properties with chemical accuracy. Here we report a new functional, called MN15, that has broader accuracy than any previously available one. The properties considered in the parameterization include bond energies, atomization energies, ionization potentials, electron affinities, proton affinities, reaction barrier heights, noncovalent interactions, hydrocarbon thermochemistry, isomerization energies, electronic excitation energies, absolute atomic energies, and molecular structures. When compared with 82 other density functionals that have been defined in the literature, MN15 gives the second smallest mean unsigned error (MUE) for 54 data on inherently multiconfigurational systems, the smallest MUE for 313 single-reference chemical data, and the smallest MUE on 87 noncovalent data, with MUEs for these three categories of 4.75, 1.85, and 0.25 kcal mol 1 , respectively, as compared to the average MUEs of the other 82 functionals of 14.0, 4.63, and 1.98 kcal mol 1 . The MUE for 17 absolute atomic energies is 7.4 kcal mol 1 as compared to an average MUE of the other 82 functionals of 34.6 kcal mol 1 . We further tested MN15 for 10 transition-metal coordination energies, the entire S66x8 database of noncovalent interactions, 21 transition-metal reaction barrier heights, 69 electronic excitation energies of organic molecules, 31 semiconductor band gaps, seven transition-metal dimer bond lengths, and 193 bond lengths of 47 organic molecules. The MN15 functional not only performs very well for our training set, which has 481 pieces of data, but also performs very well for our test set, which has 823 data that are not in our training set. The test set includes both ground-state properties and molecular excitation energies. For the latter MN15 achieves simultaneous accuracy for both valence and Rydberg electronic excitations when used with linear-response time-dependent density functional theory, with an MUE of less than 0.3 eV for both types of excitations.},

abstract = {The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) has been a workhorse exchange-correlation functional for electronic structure studies of extended systems (liquid-phase reactions, solids, heterogeneous and enzymatic catalysis, biopolymers) because its dependence on only the spin-labeled electron densities and their reduced gradients makes it the most affordable choice that produces realistic results for thermochemistry. However, much recent research has focused on its poor performance for solid-state lattice constants; the results for lattice constants can be improved but only at the cost of making the energetic predictions worse. In the present article, we propose a new density functional, called N12, which may be thought of as a generalization of range-separated functionals. The N12 functional depends only on the spin-labeled electron densities and their reduced gradients, but with a new kind of nonseparable term that gives it much greater flexibility. The N12 functional is the first exchange-correlation functional depending only on the spin-labeled electron densities and their reduced gradients that simultaneously provides good accuracy for the four key energetic and structural properties of solids and molecules, namely, solid-state cohesive energies and lattice constants and molecular atomization energies and bond lengths.},

abstract = {We present two new hybrid meta exchange- correlation functionals, called M06 and M06-2X. The M06 functional is parametrized including both transition metals and nonmetals, whereas the M06-2X functional is a high-nonlocality functional with double the amount of nonlocal exchange (2X), and it is parametrized only for nonmetals.The functionals, along with the previously published M06-L local functional and the M06-HF full-Hartree–Fock functionals, constitute the M06 suite of complementary functionals. We assess these four functionals by comparing their performance to that of 12 other functionals and Hartree–Fock theory for 403 energetic data in 29 diverse databases, including ten databases for thermochemistry, four databases for kinetics, eight databases for noncovalent interactions, three databases for transition metal bonding, one database for metal atom excitation energies, and three databases for molecular excitation energies. We also illustrate the performance of these 17 methods for three databases containing 40 bond lengths and for databases containing 38 vibrational frequencies and 15 vibrational zero point energies. We recommend the M06-2X functional for applications involving main-group thermochemistry, kinetics, noncovalent interactions, and electronic excitation energies to valence and Rydberg states. We recommend the M06 functional for application in organometallic and inorganometallic chemistry and for noncovalent interactions.},

@article{GrimmeStefan2006Shdf,

abstract = {A new hybrid density functional for general chemistry applications is proposed. It is based on a mixing of standard generalized gradient approximations (GGAs) for exchange by Becke (B) and for correlation by Lee, Yang, and Parr (LYP) with Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange and a perturbative second-order correlation part (PT2) that is obtained from the Kohn-Sham (GGA) orbitals and eigenvalues. This virtual orbital-dependent functional contains only two global parameters that describe the mixture of HF and GGA exchange ( a x ) and of the PT2 and GGA correlation ( c ) , respectively. The parameters are obtained in a least-squares-fit procedure to the G 2 ∕ 97 set of heat of formations. Opposed to conventional hybrid functionals, the optimum a x is found to be quite large (53% with c = 27 % ) which at least in part explains the success for many problematic molecular systems compared to conventional approaches. The performance of the new functional termed B2-PLYP is assessed by the G 2 ∕ 97 standard benchmark set, a second test suite of atoms, molecules, and reactions that are considered as electronically very difficult (including transition-metal compounds, weakly bonded complexes, and reaction barriers) and comparisons with other hybrid functionals of GGA and meta-GGA types. According to many realistic tests, B2-PLYP can be regarded as the best general purpose density functional for molecules (e.g., a mean absolute deviation for the two test sets of only 1.8 and 3.2 kcal ∕ mol compared to about 3 and 5 kcal ∕ mol , respectively, for the best other density functionals). Very importantly, also the maximum and minium errors (outliers) are strongly reduced (by about 10 – 20 kcal ∕ mol ). Furthermore, very good results are obtained for transition state barriers but unlike previous attempts at such a good description, this definitely comes not at the expense of equilibrium properties. Preliminary calculations of the equilibrium bond lengths and harmonic vibrational frequencies for diatomic molecules and transition-metal complexes also show very promising results. The uniformity with which B2-PLYP improves for a wide range of chemical systems emphasizes the need of (virtual) orbital-dependent terms that describe nonlocal electron correlation in accurate exchange-correlation functionals. From a practical point of view, the new functional seems to be very robust and it is thus suggested as an efficient quantum chemical method of general purpose.},

abstract = {We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called "dropout" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3 percent, compared to 26.2 percent achieved by the second-best entry.},

abstract = {Research projects in structural biology increasingly rely on combinations of heterogeneous sources of information, {\it e.g.} evolutionary information from multiple sequence alignments, experimental evidence in the form of density maps and proximity constraints from proteomics experiments. The {\it OpenStructure} software framework, which allows the seamless integration of information of different origin, has previously been introduced. The software consists of C++ libraries which are fully accessible from the Python programming language. Additionally, the framework provides a sophisticated graphics module that interactively displays molecular structures and density maps in three dimensions. In this work, the latest developments in the {\it OpenStructure} framework are outlined. The extensive capabilities of the framework will be illustrated using short code examples that show how information from molecular-structure coordinates can be combined with sequence data and/or density maps. The framework has been released under the LGPL version 3 license and is available for download from http://www.openstructure.org.},

The emphasis is on computation and visualization of electronic and molecular properties but, e.g., reaction pathways can be simulated as well. Some molecular properties of interest are processed directly from the output of the computational chemistry programs, others are calculated in MOLDEN before display. The package features different options to display MOLecular electronic DENsity, each focusing on a different structural aspect: molecular orbitals, electron density, molecular minus atomic density and the Laplacian of the electron density. To display difference density, either the spherically averaged atomic density or the oriented ground state atomic density can be used for a number of standard basis sets. The quantum mechanical electrostatic potential or a distributed multipole expansion derived electrostatic potential can be calculated and atomic charges can be fitted to these potentials calculated on Connolly surface(s). Reaction pathways and molecular vibrations can be visualized. Input structures can be generated with a Z-matrix editor. A variety of graphics languages is supported: XWindows, postscript, VRML and Povray format.",

  abstract = {Simulations based on solving the Kohn-Sham (KS) equation of density functional theory (DFT) have become a vital component of modern materials and chemical sciences research and development portfolios. Despite its versatility, routine DFT calculations are usually limited to a few hundred atoms due to the computational bottleneck posed by the KS equation. Here we introduce a machine-learning-based scheme to efficiently assimilate the function of the KS equation, and by-pass it to directly, rapidly, and accurately predict the electronic structure of a material or a molecule, given just its atomic configuration. A new rotationally invariant representation is utilized to map the atomic environment around a grid-point to the electron density and local density of states at that grid-point. This mapping is learned using a neural network trained on previously generated reference DFT results at millions of grid-points. The proposed paradigm allows for the high-fidelity emulation of KS DFT, but orders of magnitude faster than the direct solution. Moreover, the machine learning prediction scheme is strictly linear-scaling with system size.},

In ASE, tasks are fully scripted in Python. The powerful syntax of Python combined with the NumPy array library make it possible to perform very complex simulation tasks. For example, a sequence of calculations may be performed with the use of a simple ‘for-loop’ construction. Calculations of energy, forces, stresses and other quantities are performed through interfaces to many external electronic structure codes or force fields using a uniform interface. On top of this calculator interface, ASE provides modules for performing many standard simulation tasks such as structure optimization, molecular dynamics, handling of constraints and performing nudged elastic band calculations.}

abstract = {A lot of progress has been made in recent years in the development of atomistic potentials using machine learning (ML) techniques. In contrast to most conventional potentials, which are based on physical approximations and simplifications to derive an analytic functional relation between the atomic configuration and the potential-energy, ML potentials rely on simple but very flexible mathematical terms without a direct physical meaning. Instead, in case of ML potentials the topology of the potential-energy surface is “learned” by adjusting a number of parameters with the aim to reproduce a set of reference electronic structure data as accurately as possible. Due to this bias-free construction, they are applicable to a wide range of systems without changes in their functional form, and a very high accuracy close to the underlying first-principles data can be obtained. Neural network potentials (NNPs), which have first been proposed about two decades ago, are an important class of ML potentials. Although the first NNPs have been restricted to small molecules with only a few degrees of freedom, they are now applicable to high-dimensional systems containing thousands of atoms, which enables addressing a variety of problems in chemistry, physics, and materials science. In this tutorial review, the basic ideas of NNPs are presented with a special focus on developing NNPs for high-dimensional condensed systems. A recipe for the construction of these potentials is given and remaining limitations of the method are discussed. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = "Electronic structure calculations, such as those employing Kohn–Sham density functional theory or ab initio wavefunction theories, have allowed for atomistic-level understandings of a wide variety of phenomena and properties of matter at small scales. However, the computational cost of electronic structure methods drastically increases with length and time scales, which makes these methods difficult for long time-scale molecular dynamics simulations or large-sized systems. Machine-learning techniques can provide accurate potentials that can match the quality of electronic structure calculations, provided sufficient training data. These potentials can then be used to rapidly simulate large and long time-scale phenomena at similar quality to the parent electronic structure approach. Machine-learning potentials usually take a bias-free mathematical form and can be readily developed for a wide variety of systems. Electronic structure calculations have favorable properties–namely that they are noiseless and targeted training data can be produced on-demand–that make them particularly well-suited for machine learning. This paper discusses our modular approach to atomistic machine learning through the development of the open-source Atomistic Machine-learning Package (Amp), which allows for representations of both the total and atom-centered potential energy surface, in both periodic and non-periodic systems. Potentials developed through the atom-centered approach are simultaneously applicable for systems with various sizes. Interpolation can be enhanced by introducing custom descriptors of the local environment. We demonstrate this in the current work for Gaussian-type, bispectrum, and Zernike-type descriptors. Amp  has an intuitive and modular structure with an interface through the python scripting language yet has parallelizable fortran components for demanding tasks; it is designed to integrate closely with the widely used Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE), which makes it compatible with a wide variety of commercial and open-source electronic structure codes. We finally demonstrate that the neural network model inside Amp  can accurately interpolate electronic structure energies as well as forces of thousands of multi-species atomic systems.

abstract = {<p><p>This paper develops the multidimensional binary search tree (or <italic>k</italic>-d tree, where <italic>k</italic> is the dimensionality of the search space) as a data structure for storage of information to be retrieved by associative searches. The <italic>k</italic>-d tree is defined and examples are given. It is shown to be quite efficient in its storage requirements. A significant advantage of this structure is that a single data structure can handle many types of queries very efficiently. Various utility algorithms are developed; their proven average running times in an <italic>n</italic> record file are: insertion, <italic>O</italic>(log <italic>n</italic>); deletion of the root, <italic>O</italic>(<italic>n</italic><supscrpt>(<italic>k</italic>-1)/<italic>k</italic></supscrpt>); deletion of a random node, <italic>O</italic>(log <italic>n</italic>); and optimization (guarantees logarithmic performance of searches), <italic>O</italic>(<italic>n</italic> log <italic>n</italic>). Search algorithms are given for partial match queries with <italic>t</italic> keys specified [proven maximum running time of <italic>O</italic>(<italic>n</italic><supscrpt>(<italic>k</italic>-<italic>t</italic>)/<italic>k</italic></supscrpt>)] and for nearest neighbor queries [empirically observed average running time of <italic>O</italic>(log <italic>n</italic>).] These performances far surpass the best currently known algorithms for these tasks. An algorithm is presented to handle any general intersection query. The main focus of this paper is theoretical. It is felt, however, that <italic>k</italic>-d trees could be quite useful in many applications, and examples of potential uses are given.</p></p>},

abstract = {Universal variational functionals of densities, first-order density matrices, and natural spin-orbitals are explicitly displayed for variational calculations of ground states of interacting electrons in atoms, molecules, and solids. In all cases, the functionals search for constrained minima. In particular, following Percus Q[$\rho $] = min $\langle \Psi _{\rho}|\hat{T}$ + $\hat{V}_{ee}|\Psi _{\rho}\rangle $ is identified as the universal functional of Hohenberg and Kohn for the sum of the kinetic and electron-electron repulsion energies of an N-representable trial electron density $\rho $. Q[$\rho $] searches all antisymmetric wavefunctions $\Psi _{\rho}$ which yield the fixed $\rho $. Q[$\rho $] then delivers that expectation value which is a minimum. Similarly, W[$\gamma $] = min $\langle \Psi _{\gamma}|\hat{V}_{ee}|\Psi _{\gamma}\rangle $ is shown to be the universal functional for the electron-electron repulsion energy of an N-representable trial first-order density matrix $\gamma $, where the actual external potential may be nonlocal as well as local. These universal functions do not require that a trial function for a variational calculation be associated with a ground state of some external potential. Thus, the v-representability problem, which is especially severe for trial first-order density matrices, has been solved. Universal variational functionals in Hartree-Fock and other restricted wavefunction theories are also presented. Finally, natural spin-orbital functional theory is compared with traditional orbital formulations in density functional theory.},

abstract = {We present a computational scheme for orbital-free density functional theory (OFDFT) that simultaneously provides access to all-electron values and preserves the OFDFT linear scaling as a function of the system size. Using the projector augmented-wave method (PAW) in combination with real-space methods, we overcome some obstacles faced by other available implementation schemes. Specifically, the advantages of using the PAW method are twofold. First, PAW reproduces all-electron values offering freedom in adjusting the convergence parameters and the atomic setups allow tuning the numerical accuracy per element. Second, PAW can provide a solution to some of the convergence problems exhibited in other OFDFT implementations based on Kohn-Sham (KS) codes. Using PAW and real-space methods, our orbital-free results agree with the reference all-electron values with a mean absolute error of 10 meV and the number of iterations required by the self-consistent cycle is comparable to the KS method. The comparison of all-electron and pseudopotential bulk modulus and lattice constant reveal an enormous difference, demonstrating that in order to assess the performance of OFDFT functionals it is necessary to use implementations that obtain all-electron values. The proposed combination of methods is the most promising route currently available. We finally show that a parametrized kinetic energy functional can give lattice constants and bulk moduli comparable in accuracy to those obtained by the KS PBE method, exemplified with the case of diamond.},

we mention briefly the essential progress on single-point functionals since our
original paper (2006). Then we focus on the advantages and limitations of
generalized gradient approximation (GGA) non-interacting kinetic-energy
functionals. We reconsider the constraints provided by near-origin conditions
in atomic-like systems and their relationship to regularized versus physical
external potentials. Then we seek the best empirical GGA for the
non-interacting KE for a modest-sized set of molecules with a well-defined
near-origin behavior of their densities. The search is motivated by a desire
for insight into GGA limitations and for a target for constraint-based
development.},

abstract = {Computational de novo design of new drugs and materials requires rigorous and unbiased exploration of chemical compound space. However, large uncharted territories persist due to its size scaling combinatorially with molecular size. We report computed geometric, energetic, electronic, and thermodynamic properties for 134k stable small organic molecules made up of CHONF. These molecules correspond to the subset of all 133,885 species with up to nine heavy atoms (CONF) out of the GDB-17 chemical universe of 166 billion organic molecules. We report geometries minimal in energy, corresponding harmonic frequencies, dipole moments, polarizabilities, along with energies, enthalpies, and free energies of atomization. All properties were calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p) level of quantum chemistry. Furthermore, for the predominant stoichiometry, C7H10O2, there are 6,095 constitutional isomers among the 134k molecules. We report energies, enthalpies, and free energies of atomization at the more accurate G4MP2 level of theory for all of them. As such, this data set provides quantum chemical properties for a relevant, consistent, and comprehensive chemical space of small organic molecules. This database may serve the benchmarking of existing methods, development of new methods, such as hybrid quantum mechanics/machine learning, and systematic identification of structure-property relationships.},

abstract  ="Deep learning is revolutionizing many areas of science and technology{,} especially image{,} text{,} and speech recognition. In this paper{,} we demonstrate how a deep neural network (NN) trained on quantum mechanical (QM) DFT calculations can learn an accurate and transferable potential for organic molecules. We introduce ANAKIN-ME (Accurate NeurAl networK engINe for Molecular Energies) or ANI for short. ANI is a new method designed with the intent of developing transferable neural network potentials that utilize a highly-modified version of the Behler and Parrinello symmetry functions to build single-atom atomic environment vectors (AEV) as a molecular representation. AEVs provide the ability to train neural networks to data that spans both configurational and conformational space{,} a feat not previously accomplished on this scale. We utilized ANI to build a potential called ANI-1{,} which was trained on a subset of the GDB databases with up to 8 heavy atoms in order to predict total energies for organic molecules containing four atom types: H{,} C{,} N{,} and O. To obtain an accelerated but physically relevant sampling of molecular potential surfaces{,} we also proposed a Normal Mode Sampling (NMS) method for generating molecular conformations. Through a series of case studies{,} we show that ANI-1 is chemically accurate compared to reference DFT calculations on much larger molecular systems (up to 54 atoms) than those included in the training data set."}

It has been developed over the last three decades with a primary focus on molecules of biological interest, including proteins, peptides, lipids, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and small molecule ligands, as they occur in solution, crystals, and membrane environments. For the study of such systems, the program provides a large suite of computational tools that include numerous conformational and path sampling methods, free energy estimators, molecular minimization, dynamics, and analysis techniques, and model‐building capabilities. The CHARMM program is applicable to problems involving a much broader class of many‐particle systems. Calculations with CHARMM can be performed using a number of different energy functions and models, from mixed quantum mechanical‐molecular mechanical force fields, to all‐atom classical potential energy functions with explicit solvent and various boundary conditions, to implicit solvent and membrane models. The program has been ported to numerous platforms in both serial and parallel architectures. This article provides an overview of the program as it exists today with an emphasis on developments since the publication of the original CHARMM article in 1983. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.J Comput Chem, 2009.},

abstract = {We introduce a representation of any atom in any chemical environment for the automatized generation of universal kernel ridge regression-based quantum machine learning (QML) models of electronic properties, trained throughout chemical compound space. The representation is based on Gaussian distribution functions, scaled by power laws and explicitly accounting for structural as well as elemental degrees of freedom. The elemental components help us to lower the QML model’s learning curve, and, through interpolation across the periodic table, even enable “alchemical extrapolation” to covalent bonding between elements not part of training. This point is demonstrated for the prediction of covalent binding in single, double, and triple bonds among main-group elements as well as for atomization energies in organic molecules. We present numerical evidence that resulting QML energy models, after training on a few thousand random training instances, reach chemical accuracy for out-of-sample compounds. Compound datasets studied include thousands of structurally and compositionally diverse organic molecules, non-covalently bonded protein side-chains, (H2O)40-clusters, and crystalline solids. Learning curves for QML models also indicate competitive predictive power for various other electronic ground state properties of organic molecules, calculated with hybrid density functional theory, including polarizability, heat-capacity, HOMO-LUMO eigenvalues and gap, zero point vibrational energy, dipole moment, and highest vibrational fundamental frequency.},

Here, we develop a crystal graph convolutional neural networks framework to directly learn material properties from the connection of atoms in the crystal, providing a universal and interpretable representation of crystalline materials. Our method provides a highly accurate prediction of density functional theory calculated properties for eight different properties of crystals with various structure types and compositions after being trained with 10^{4} data points. Further, our framework is interpretable because one can extract the contributions from local chemical environments to global properties. Using an example of perovskites, we show how this information can be utilized to discover empirical rules for materials design.},

In order to keep up with state-of-the-art experiments and the ever growing complexity of the investigated problems, there is a constantly increasing need for simulations of more realistic, i.e., larger, model systems with improved accuracy. In many cases, the availability of sufficiently efficient interatomic potentials providing reliable energies and forces has become a serious bottleneck for performing these simulations. To address this problem, currently a paradigm change is taking place in the development of interatomic potentials. Since the early days of computer simulations simplified potentials have been derived using physical approximations whenever the direct application of electronic structure methods has been too demanding. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) now offer an alternative approach for the representation of potential-energy surfaces by fitting large data sets from electronic structure calculations. In this perspective, the central ideas underlying these ML potentials, solved problems and remaining challenges are reviewed along with a discussion of their current applicability and limitations.},

To assess the ever-increasing number of approximate exchange-correlation functionals, this review benchmarks a total of 200 density functionals on a molecular database (MGCDB84) of nearly 5000 data points. The database employed, provided as Supplemental Data, is comprised of 84 data-sets and contains non-covalent interactions, isomerisation energies, thermochemistry, and barrier heights. In addition, the evolution of non-empirical and semi-empirical density functional design is reviewed, and guidelines are provided for the proper and effective use of density functionals. The most promising functional considered is ωB97M-V, a range-separated hybrid meta-GGA with VV10 nonlocal correlation, designed using a combinatorial approach. From the local GGAs, B97-D3, revPBE-D3, and BLYP-D3 are recommended, while from the local meta-GGAs, B97M-rV is the leading choice, followed by MS1-D3 and M06-L-D3. The best hybrid GGAs are ωB97X-V, ωB97X-D3, and ωB97X-D, while useful hybrid meta-GGAs (besides ωB97M-V) include ωM05-D, M06-2X-D3, and MN15. Ultimately, today's state-of-the-art functionals are close to achieving the level of accuracy desired for a broad range of chemical applications, and the principal remaining limitations are associated with systems that exhibit significant self-interaction/delocalisation errors and/or strong correlation effects.},

Here, we review the theoretical background of MD and enhanced sampling methods, focusing on free-energy perturbation, metadynamics, steered MD, and other methods most consistently used to study drug–target binding. We discuss unbiased MD simulations that nowadays allow the observation of unsupervised ligand–target binding, assessing how these approaches help optimizing target affinity and drug residence time toward improved drug efficacy. Further issues discussed include allosteric modulation and the role of water molecules in ligand binding and optimization.

abstract = {Molecular simulation is a powerful computational tool for a broad range of applications including the examination of materials properties and accelerating drug discovery. At the heart of molecular simulation is the analytic potential energy function. These functions span the range of complexity from very simple functions used to model generic phenomena to complex functions designed to model chemical reactions. The complexity of the mathematical function impacts the computational speed and is typically linked to the accuracy of the results obtained from simulations that utilize the function. One approach to improving accuracy is to simply add more parameters and additional complexity to the analytic function. This approach is typically used in non-reactive force fields where the functional form is not derived from quantum mechanical principles. The form of other types of potentials, such as the bond-order potentials, is based on quantum mechanics and has led to varying levels of accuracy and transferability. When selecting a potential energy function for use in molecular simulations, the accuracy, transferability, and computational speed must all be considered. In this focused review, some of the more commonly used potential energy functions for molecular simulations are reviewed with an eye toward presenting their general forms, strengths, and weaknesses.},

abstract = {Propelled partly by the Materials Genome Initiative, and partly by the algorithmic developments and the resounding successes of data-driven efforts in other domains, informatics strategies are beginning to take shape within materials science. These approaches lead to surrogate machine learning models that enable rapid predictions based purely on past data rather than by direct experimentation or by computations/simulations in which fundamental equations are explicitly solved. Data-centric informatics methods are becoming useful to determine material properties that are hard to measure or compute using traditional methods—due to the cost, time or effort involved—but for which reliable data either already exists or can be generated for at least a subset of the critical cases. Predictions are typically interpolative, involving fingerprinting a material numerically first, and then following a mapping (established via a learning algorithm) between the fingerprint and the property of interest. Fingerprints, also referred to as “descriptors”, may be of many types and scales, as dictated by the application domain and needs. Predictions may also be extrapolative—extending into new materials spaces—provided prediction uncertainties are properly taken into account. This article attempts to provide an overview of some of the recent successful data-driven “materials informatics” strategies undertaken in the last decade, with particular emphasis on the fingerprint or descriptor choices. The review also identifies some challenges the community is facing and those that should be overcome in the near future.},

	abstract = {The development of interatomic potentials employing artificial neural networks has seen tremendous progress in recent years. While until recently the applicability of neural network potentials (NNPs) has been restricted to low-dimensional systems, this limitation has now been overcome and high-dimensional NNPs can be used in large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of thousands of atoms. NNPs are constructed by adjusting a set of parameters using data from electronic structure calculations, and in many cases energies and forces can be obtained with very high accuracy. Therefore, NNP-based simulation results are often very close to those gained by a direct application of first-principles methods. In this review, the basic methodology of high-dimensional NNPs will be presented with a special focus on the scope and the remaining limitations of this approach. The development of NNPs requires substantial computational effort as typically thousands of reference calculations are required. Still, if the problem to be studied involves very large systems or long simulation times this overhead is regained quickly. Further, the method is still limited to systems containing about three or four chemical elements due to the rapidly increasing complexity of the configuration space, although many atoms of each species can be present. Due to the ability of NNPs to describe even extremely complex atomic configurations with excellent accuracy irrespective of the nature of the atomic interactions, they represent a general and therefore widely applicable technique, e.g. for addressing problems in materials science, for investigating properties of interfaces, and for studying solvation processes.}

abstract = {In recent years, machine learning (ML) methods have become increasingly popular in computational chemistry. After being trained on appropriate ab initio reference data, these methods allow for accurately predicting the properties of chemical systems, circumventing the need for explicitly solving the electronic Schrödinger equation. Because of their computational efficiency and scalability to large data sets, deep neural networks (DNNs) are a particularly promising ML algorithm for chemical applications. This work introduces PhysNet, a DNN architecture designed for predicting energies, forces, and dipole moments of chemical systems. PhysNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the QM9, MD17, and ISO17 benchmarks. Further, two new data sets are generated in order to probe the performance of ML models for describing chemical reactions, long-range interactions, and condensed phase systems. It is shown that explicitly including electrostatics in energy predictions is crucial for a qualitatively correct description of the asymptotic regions of a potential energy surface (PES). PhysNet models trained on a systematically constructed set of small peptide fragments (at most eight heavy atoms) are able to generalize to considerably larger proteins like deca-alanine (Ala10): The optimized geometry of helical Ala10 predicted by PhysNet is virtually identical to ab initio results (RMSD = 0.21 Å). By running unbiased molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of Ala10 on the PhysNet-PES in gas phase, it is found that instead of a helical structure, Ala10 folds into a “wreath-shaped” configuration, which is more stable than the helical form by 0.46 kcal mol–1 according to the reference ab initio calculations.},

crucial task for artificial intelligence aided molecular design. A growing
number of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been proposed to address this
challenge. These models improve their expressive power by incorporating
auxiliary information in molecules while inevitably increase their
computational complexity. In this work, we aim to design a GNN which is both
powerful and efficient for molecule structures. To achieve such goal, we
propose a molecular mechanics-driven approach by first representing each
molecule as a two-layer multiplex graph, where one layer contains only local
connections that mainly capture the covalent interactions and another layer
contains global connections that can simulate non-covalent interactions. Then
for each layer, a corresponding message passing module is proposed to balance
the trade-off of expression power and computational complexity. Based on these
two modules, we build Multiplex Molecular Graph Neural Network (MXMNet). When
validated by the QM9 dataset for small molecules and PDBBind dataset for large

Most of the existing methods treat molecules as molecular graphs in which atoms are modeled as nodes. They characterize each atom&#x27;s chemical environment by modeling its pairwise interactions with other atoms in the molecule. Although these methods achieve a great success, limited amount of works explicitly take many-body interactions, i.e., interactions between three and more atoms, into consideration. In this paper, we introduce a novel graph representation of molecules, heterogeneous molecular graph (HMG) in which nodes and edges are of various types, to model many-body interactions. HMGs have the potential to carry complex geometric information. To leverage the rich information stored in HMGs for chemical prediction problems, we build heterogeneous molecular graph neural networks (HMGNN) on the basis of a neural message passing scheme. HMGNN incorporates global molecule representations and an attention mechanism into the prediction process. The predictions of HMGNN are invariant to translation and rotation of atom coordinates, and permutation of atom indices.

abstract = {Quantum mechanics‐based ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulation schemes offer an accurate and direct means to monitor the time evolution of materials. Nevertheless, the expensive and repetitive energy and force computations required in such simulations lead to significant bottlenecks. Here, we lay the foundations for an accelerated ab initio MD approach integrated with a machine learning framework. The proposed algorithm learns from previously visited configurations in a continuous and adaptive manner on‐the‐fly, and predicts (with chemical accuracy) the energies and atomic forces of a new configuration at a minuscule fraction of the time taken by conventional ab initio methods. Key elements of this new accelerated ab initio MD paradigm include representations of atomic configurations by numerical fingerprints, a learning algorithm to map the fingerprints to the properties, a decision engine that guides the choice of the prediction scheme, and requisite amount of ab initio data. The performance of each aspect of the proposed scheme is critically evaluated for Al in several different chemical environments. This work has enormous implications beyond ab initio MD acceleration. It can also lead to accelerated structure and property prediction schemes, and accurate force fields. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
The dynamical atomic‐level evolution of typical chemical processes extends to timescales longer than nanoseconds—hard to access routinely using present ab initio methods. Here, an adaptive machine learning framework is proposed to significantly accelerate ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. The scheme learns to predict energies and atomic forces with unprecedented speed and accuracy from an initial ab initio dataset, and systematically expands its predictive capability on‐the‐fly by including newly encountered chemical environments in its training.},

abstract = "The molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is a favored method in materials science for understanding and predicting material properties from atomistic motions. In classical MD simulations, the interaction between atoms is described by an empirical interatomic potential, so the reliability of the simulation hinges on the accuracy of the underlying potential. Recently, machine learning (ML) based interatomic potentials are gaining attention as they can reproduce potential energy surfaces (PES) of ab initio calculations, with a much lower computational cost. Therefore, an efficient code for training ML potentials and inferencing PES in new configurations would widen the application range of MD simulations. Here, we announce an open-source package, SNU Interatomic Machine-learning PotentiaL packagE-version Neural Network (SIMPLE-NN) that generates and utilizes the ML potential based on the artificial neural network with the Behler–Parrinello type symmetry function as descriptors for the chemical environments. SIMPLE-NN uses the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) package and Google Tensorflow for high expandability and efficient training, and also supports the in-house code for quasi-Newton method. Notably, the package features a weighting scheme based on the Gaussian density function (GDF), which significantly improves accuracy and reliability of ML potentials by resolving sampling bias that exists in typical training sets. For MD simulations, SIMPLE-NN interfaces with the LAMMPS package. We demonstrate the performance and usage of SIMPLE-NN with examples of SiO2.

abstract = "Electronic structure calculations, such as those employing Kohn–Sham density functional theory or ab initio wavefunction theories, have allowed for atomistic-level understandings of a wide variety of phenomena and properties of matter at small scales. However, the computational cost of electronic structure methods drastically increases with length and time scales, which makes these methods difficult for long time-scale molecular dynamics simulations or large-sized systems. Machine-learning techniques can provide accurate potentials that can match the quality of electronic structure calculations, provided sufficient training data. These potentials can then be used to rapidly simulate large and long time-scale phenomena at similar quality to the parent electronic structure approach. Machine-learning potentials usually take a bias-free mathematical form and can be readily developed for a wide variety of systems. Electronic structure calculations have favorable properties–namely that they are noiseless and targeted training data can be produced on-demand–that make them particularly well-suited for machine learning. This paper discusses our modular approach to atomistic machine learning through the development of the open-source Atomistic Machine-learning Package (Amp), which allows for representations of both the total and atom-centered potential energy surface, in both periodic and non-periodic systems. Potentials developed through the atom-centered approach are simultaneously applicable for systems with various sizes. Interpolation can be enhanced by introducing custom descriptors of the local environment. We demonstrate this in the current work for Gaussian-type, bispectrum, and Zernike-type descriptors. Amp  has an intuitive and modular structure with an interface through the python scripting language yet has parallelizable fortran components for demanding tasks; it is designed to integrate closely with the widely used Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE), which makes it compatible with a wide variety of commercial and open-source electronic structure codes. We finally demonstrate that the neural network model inside Amp  can accurately interpolate electronic structure energies as well as forces of thousands of multi-species atomic systems.

abstract = {Highly accurate potential energy surfaces are of key interest for the detailed understanding and predictive modeling of chemical systems. In recent years, several new types of force fields, which are based on machine learning algorithms and fitted to ab initio reference calculations, have been introduced to meet this requirement. Here, we show how high-dimensional neural network potentials can be employed to automatically generate the potential energy surface of finite sized clusters at coupled cluster accuracy, namely CCSD­(T*)-F12a/aug-cc-pVTZ. The developed automated procedure utilizes the established intrinsic properties of the model such that the configurations for the training set are selected in an unbiased and efficient way to minimize the computational effort of expensive reference calculations. These ideas are applied to protonated water clusters from the hydronium cation, H3O+, up to the tetramer, H9O4 +, and lead to a single potential energy surface that describes all these systems at essentially converged coupled cluster accuracy with a fitting error of 0.06 kJ/mol per atom. The fit is validated in detail for all clusters up to the tetramer and yields reliable results not only for stationary points but also for reaction pathways and intermediate configurations as well as different sampling techniques. Per design, the neural network potentials (NNPs) constructed in this fashion can handle very different conditions including the quantum nature of the nuclei and enhanced sampling techniques covering very low as well as high temperatures. This enables fast and exhaustive exploration of the targeted protonated water clusters with essentially converged interactions. In addition, the automated process will allow one to tackle finite systems much beyond the present case.},

Methods based on the principles of quantum mechanics (QM), while offering valuable theoretical guidance at the electronic level, are often too computationally intense for simulations that consider the full dynamic evolution of a system. Alternatively, empirical interatomic potentials that are based on classical principles require significantly fewer computational resources, which enables simulations to better describe dynamic processes over longer timeframes and on larger scales. Such methods, however, typically require a predefined connectivity between atoms, precluding simulations that involve reactive events. The ReaxFF method was developed to help bridge this gap. Approaching the gap from the classical side, ReaxFF casts the empirical interatomic potential within a bond-order formalism, thus implicitly describing chemical bonding without expensive QM calculations.

We illustrate its capabilities to address critical issues in the area of nuclear fuel. In particular, we look at U, UO2 and the process of oxidation of U. Further, we characterize the mechanical behavior of Zr, representing LWR clad, and explore the effects of oxidation and hydridation on the mechanical response and briefly illustrate the capabilities of COMB simulations of corrosion. Finally, we briefly assess the materials fidelity of the COMB approach by examining the COMB description for the Zr-H system."

abstract = {This chapter describes the status of empirical force fields for proteins. Understanding structure–activity relationships of biological macromolecules has been greatly facilitated by theoretical methods based on empirical force ﬁelds. Empirical force-ﬁeld-based methods allow for atomic detail interpretation of a variety of experimental data and impart the ability to access short-lived conformations occurring in structural transitions and chemical catalysis that are not readily accessible to experimental approaches. Currently, the three most commonly used all-atom force ﬁelds are the OPLS/AA, CHARMM22, and AMBER (PARM99) models. The Lennard–Jones (LJ) parameters for all three force ﬁelds have primarily been based on the reproduction of condensed-phase properties, typically neat liquids. Following the assignment of partial atomic charges, the LJ parameters for a model compound are adjusted to reproduce experimentally determined heats of vaporization and density, as well as isocompressibilities and heat capacities when available. Changes in the partial atomic charges for AMBER based on high level quantum mechanical data have been performed in conjunction with adjustments to the backbone dihedral parameters. Alterations to the charge distribution of a protein force ﬁeld should be done with great care. New charges should be accompanied by the reevaluation of all aspects of the internal portion of the force ﬁeld as changes in geometries, vibrational spectra, and conformational energies will occur because of electrostatic contributions to those properties.},

abstract = {Molecular simulation is a powerful computational tool for a broad range of applications including the examination of materials properties and accelerating drug discovery. At the heart of molecular simulation is the analytic potential energy function. These functions span the range of complexity from very simple functions used to model generic phenomena to complex functions designed to model chemical reactions. The complexity of the mathematical function impacts the computational speed and is typically linked to the accuracy of the results obtained from simulations that utilize the function. One approach to improving accuracy is to simply add more parameters and additional complexity to the analytic function. This approach is typically used in non-reactive force fields where the functional form is not derived from quantum mechanical principles. The form of other types of potentials, such as the bond-order potentials, is based on quantum mechanics and has led to varying levels of accuracy and transferability. When selecting a potential energy function for use in molecular simulations, the accuracy, transferability, and computational speed must all be considered. In this focused review, some of the more commonly used potential energy functions for molecular simulations are reviewed with an eye toward presenting their general forms, strengths, and weaknesses.},

For this reason there is a need for accurate potentials that are able to quickly reproduce ab initio quality results at the fraction of the cost. The interactions within force fields are represented by a number of functions. Some interactions are well understood and can be represented by simple mathematical functions while others are not so well understood and their functional form is represented in a simplistic manner or not even known. In the last 20 years there have been the first examples of a new design ethic, where novel and contemporary methods using machine learning, in particular, artificial neural networks, have been used to find the nature of the underlying functions of a force field. Here we appraise what has been achieved over this time and what requires further improvements, while offering some insight and guidance for the development of future force fields.},

abstract = {Machine learning surrogate models for quantum mechanical simulations have enabled the field to efficiently and accurately study material and molecular systems. Developed models typically rely on a substantial amount of data to make reliable predictions of the potential energy landscape or careful active learning (AL) and uncertainty estimates. When starting with small datasets, convergence of AL approaches is a major outstanding challenge which has limited most demonstrations to online AL. In this work we demonstrate a Δ-machine learning (ML) approach that enables stable convergence in offline AL strategies by avoiding unphysical configurations with initial datasets as little as a single data point. We demonstrate our framework's capabilities on a structural relaxation, transition state calculation, and molecular dynamics simulation, with the number of first principle calculations being cut down anywhere from 70%-90%. The approach is incorporated and developed alongside AMPtorch, an open-source ML potential package, along with interactive Google Colab notebook examples.},

abstract = {The reliable prediction of molecular properties is a vital task of computational chemistry. In recent years, density functional theory (DFT) has become a popular method for calculating molecular properties for a vast array of systems varying in size from small organic molecules to large biological compounds such as proteins. In this work, we assess the ability of many DFT methods to accurately determine atomic and molecular properties for small molecules containing elements commonly found in proteins, DNA, and RNA. These properties include bond lengths, bond angles, ground-state vibrational frequencies, electron affinities, ionization potentials, heats of formation, hydrogen-bond interaction energies, conformational energies, and reaction barrier heights. Calculations are carried out with the 3-21G*, 6-31G*, 3-21+G*, 6-31+G*, 6-31++G*, cc-pVxZ, and aug-cc-pVxZ (x = D and T) basis sets, while bond-distance and bond-angle calculations are also done using the cc-pVQZ and aug-cc-pVQZ basis sets. Members of the popular functional classes, namely, local spin density approximation, generalized gradient approximation (GGA), meta-GGA, hybrid-GGA, and hybrid-meta-GGA, are considered in this work. For the purpose of comparison, Hartree−Fock and second-order many-body perturbation methods are also assessed in terms of their ability to determine these physical properties. Ultimately, it is observed that the split valence bases of the 6-31G variety provide accuracies similar to those of the more computationally expensive Dunning-type basis sets. Another conclusion from this survey is that the hybrid-meta-GGA functionals are typically among the most accurate functionals for all of the properties examined in this work.},

abstract = {Progress in the discovery of new materials has been accelerated by the development of reliable quantum-mechanical approaches to crystal structure prediction. The properties of a material depend very sensitively on its structure; therefore, structure prediction is the key to computational materials discovery. Structure prediction was considered to be a formidable problem, but the development of new computational tools has allowed the structures of many new and increasingly complex materials to be anticipated. These widely applicable methods, based on global optimization and relying on little or no empirical knowledge, have been used to study crystalline structures, point defects, surfaces and interfaces. In this Review, we discuss structure prediction methods, examining their potential for the study of different materials systems, and present examples of computationally driven discoveries of new materials — including superhard materials, superconductors and organic materials — that will enable new technologies. Advances in first-principle structure predictions also lead to a better understanding of physical and chemical phenomena in materials. Recent breakthroughs in crystal structure prediction have enabled the discovery of new materials and of new physical and chemical phenomena. This Review surveys structure prediction methods and presents examples of results in different classes of materials.},

abstract = {We present the Python Materials Genomics (pymatgen) library, a robust, open-source Python library for materials analysis. A key enabler in high-throughput computational materials science efforts is a robust set of software tools to perform initial setup for the calculations (e.g., generation of structures and necessary input files) and post-calculation analysis to derive useful material properties from raw calculated data. The pymatgen library aims to meet these needs by (1) defining core Python objects for materials data representation, (2) providing a well-tested set of structure and thermodynamic analyses relevant to many applications, and (3) establishing an open platform for researchers to collaboratively develop sophisticated analyses of materials data obtained both from first principles calculations and experiments. The pymatgen library also provides convenient tools to obtain useful materials data via the Materials Project’s REpresentational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API). As an example, using pymatgen’s interface to the Materials Project’s RESTful API and phasediagram package, we demonstrate how the phase and electrochemical stability of a recently synthesized material, Li4SnS4, can be analyzed using a minimum of computing resources. We find that Li4SnS4 is a stable phase in the Li–Sn–S phase diagram (consistent with the fact that it can be synthesized), but the narrow range of lithium chemical potentials for which it is predicted to be stable would suggest that it is not intrinsically stable against typical electrodes used in lithium-ion batteries.}

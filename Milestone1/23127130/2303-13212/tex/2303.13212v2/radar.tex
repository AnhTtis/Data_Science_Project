    Our simple method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of vision tasks compared to other task-specific or general methods under the same setting. We report the average improvement in Top-1 accuracy, bbox mAP, mask mAP, and mIoU for classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation, respectively. We calculate the performance improvement across all configurations in our paper, and we evaluate the simplicity of our method using the number of hyper-parameters as a metric (less is better).

    \caption{Following the method used in \cite{shu2021cwd}, we calculate the KL divergence between the student model (Faster RCNN-ResNet50) and the teacher model (CascadeMask RCNN ResNeXt10) on different FPN levels. There is no correlation between feature similarity and model performance. Our student has the worst similarity to teacher but achieves best mAP on COCO dataset.}
    % it is not the case that the more similar the student model and the teacher model are, the better performance the student model can achieve.

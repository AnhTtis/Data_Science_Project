    \caption{We calculate the $L2$-distance between the student model (Faster RCNN-ResNet50) and the teacher model (CascadeMask RCNN ResNeXt101) on different FPN levels. We calculate the $L2$-distance before and after the channel-wise adaption MLP. The results indicate that the MLP can help narrow the gap between the student and the teacher feature.}

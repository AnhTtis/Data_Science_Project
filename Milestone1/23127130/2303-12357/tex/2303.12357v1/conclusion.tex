\section{Conclusion}

We proposed the Wasserstein PGD attack for univariant time series data, which is the first effort to study adversarial example attacks on time series in the Wasserstein space. Compared with the original PGD attack in the Euclidean space, Wasserstein PGD can generate more imperceptible and natural adversarial examples. Extensive results showed that Wasserstein PGD can achieve higher ASR with smaller perturbations. We also explored certified robustness via Wasserstein smoothing as a potential defense method. The results showed that Wasserstein smoothing has limited certified range and accuracy gain. In the future, it would be interesting to study Wasserstein adversarial examples on multivariant time series under Gaussian distributions. Stronger certified robustness methods can also be developed by designing reduced transport plan that is more suitable for time series data.

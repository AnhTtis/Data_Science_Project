    "abstract": "Recent high-energy heavy-ion collision experiments have revealed that some atomic nuclei exhibit unusual softness and significant shape fluctuations. In this Letter, we use the fully self-consistent mean-field theory to identify all even-even nuclei that are unstable or soft against octupole deformation. All exceptional cases of enhanced octupole transition strengths in stable even-even nuclei throughout the nuclide chart are resolved. These results represent a significant advance in our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of nuclear octupole deformation and have implications for further experimental and theoretical studies.",

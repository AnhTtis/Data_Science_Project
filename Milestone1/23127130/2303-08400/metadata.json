    "abstract": "Fluid flows are typically studied by solving the Navier--Stokes equation. One of the fundamental assumptions of this equation is Stokes' hypothesis. This hypothesis assumes bulk viscosity, to be identically zero. The Stokes' hypothesis is a reasonable approximation for commonly observed fluid flows; therefore, Navier--Stokes equation gives satisfactory results in these situations. However, there are circumstances where this hypothesis does not hold good, and therefore, the classical Navier--Stokes equation becomes inapt. These situations include the absorption of sound waves, hypersonic flows, turbulent flows, and flow of Martian air etc. Reliable analytical and computational studies of these flows requires account of bulk viscosity in the governing equations. In this article, we provide a brief review of the subject of bulk viscosity. We start with a brief background of this topic. Then we discuss the underlying microscopic mechanisms that give rise to bulk viscosity effects. It was followed by a review of methods available in the literature for estimation of this parameter. Finally, a review of the studies that analyze the effects of bulk viscosity in various fluid flows is provided.",

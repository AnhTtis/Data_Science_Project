    \caption{Detailed training pipeline of \textit{Disguise}, in supplement to Figure \ref{fig:architecure}. The proposed solution is end-to-end differentiable. However, in practice, to guide the optimization process, we train the network in two phases. Firstly, we train the face-swapping network (the branch marked in dark green); then in the second phase, we add the ID obfuscation branch (marked in light green) and the utility-guaranteeing module (the branch on top) to finetune the whole network.}

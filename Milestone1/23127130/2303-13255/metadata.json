    "abstract": "Critical systems require high reliability and are present in many domains. They are systems in which failure may result in financial damage or even loss of lives. Standard techniques of software engineering are not enough to ensure the absence of unacceptable failures and/or that critical requirements are fulfilled. Reo is a component-based modelling language that aims to provide a framework to build software based on existing pieces of software, which has been used in a wide variety of domains. Its formal semantics provides grounds to certify that systems based on Reo models satisfy specific requirements (i.e., absence of deadlocks). Current logical approaches for reasoning over Reo require the conversion of formal semantics into a logical framework. ReLo is a dynamic logic that naturally subsumes Reo's semantics. It provides a means to reason over Reo circuits. This work extends ReLo by introducing the iteration operator, and soundness and completeness proofs for its axiomatization.",

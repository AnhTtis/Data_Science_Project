    "abstract": "A formula for the local acoustical admittance in a conical waveguide with viscous and thermal losses given by Nederveen [(1969) Acoustical Aspects of Woodwind Instruments (Frits Knuf, Amsterdam)] is rewritten as an impedance transmission matrix. Based on a self-consistent approximation for the cone, it differs from other one-dimensional transmission matrices used in musical acoustics, which implicitly include the loss model of a cylinder. The resonance frequencies of air columns calculated with this transmission matrix are in better agreement with more comprehensive models. Even for long cones with a slight taper, there is no need to discretize along the axis.",

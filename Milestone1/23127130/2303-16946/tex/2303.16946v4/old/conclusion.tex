\section{Conclusion \& Outlook}

Over the course of this work, we have outlined some important aspects and properties of the stabilizer formalism and how one can use it to describe and simulate the scrambling and entanglement of quantum information in different ways. Even though time constraints didn't permit us to do a full analysis of all quantities of interest (especially the code distance of the SYK code), we managed to confirm that our implementation of a stabilizer simulation using random Clifford gates seems to work as intended, and efficiently so.

Some of the next steps to be taken include refining the simulation further and introducing unit testing such that the correctness of the code can be ensured at all times. If interest from outside exists, then a documented API could also be provided in the future. In addition to that, a more systematic analysis of the parameter space for the models of interest has high priority, so that it becomes possible to answer some of the lingering questions outlined in the previous section. But thanks to the generality of the simulation, all kinds of different models can be easily implemented and analysed.

Motivated by the entanglement structure of all-to-all quantum models like the SYK model and mean-field quantum spin glass models, we propose a tensor network architecture which can capture volume law entanglement and can accommodate a large ground state degeneracy. The architecture can be viewed as a generalization of MERA, DMERA, and branching MERA networks where we remove the constraints of spatial locality. We argue that the proposed architecture can roughly capture the entanglement and complexity of the SYK model, but we leave a more detailed study to future work. We further explore the basic architecture by considering the special case where the tensors are random Clifford gates. In this case, the architecture can generate a stabilizer code with constant rate and distance that approximately saturates the quantum singleton bound, albeit at the cost of some high weight stabilizers.



%Motivated by the approximation of CFTs and their renormalization as MERA tensor networks, we constructed a network whose thermal entropy and complexity scales how one would expect from SYK models and their holographic dual in the JT gravity bulk. Taking the zero-temperature limit, the resulting circuit was interpreted as a quantum error-correcting code which encodes $n_0$ logical qudits in $n = n_0 + 2^{\ell}$ physical qubits where $\ell$ is the number of randomly sampled scrambling layers with depth $D$ in the code. Choosing $n_0 = 2$ and varying $\ell$ and $D$ let us approximate the scaling of the code distance. Unfortunately, due to time constraints only an analysis of the weight evolution for the circuit was available at time of publication. 

%Additionally, we considered the distribution of GHZ states for randomly sampled tripartite Clifford stabilizer states with various qudit dimensions and number $n_{\text{party}}$ of qudits per party. Although we arrived at the expected conclusion that for larger $n$ the GHZ content is of order $\mathcal{O}(1)$ and and thus tends to descrease relative to an increasing $n_{\text{party}}$, some numerical anomalies suggest that a closer inspection of the problem is necessary.

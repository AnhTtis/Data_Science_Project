In this Perspective we discuss a particular class of quantum codes called low-density parity-check (LDPC) quantum codes. The codes we discuss are alternatives to the surface code, which is the currently leading candidate to implement quantum fault-tolerance. We introduce the zoo of LDPC quantum codes and discuss their potential for making quantum computers robust against noise. In particular, we explain recent advances in the theory of LDPC quantum codes related to certain product constructions and discuss open problems in the field.},

	abstract = {Recently, it was realized that use of the properties of quantum mechanics might speed up certain computations dramatically. Interest has since been growing in the area of quantum computation. One of the main difficulties of quantum computation is that decoherence destroys the information in a superposition of states contained in a quantum computer, thus making long computations impossible. It is shown how to reduce the effects of decoherence for information stored in quantum memory, assuming that the decoherence process acts independently on each of the bits stored in memory. This involves the use of a quantum analog of errorcorrecting codes., This article appears in the following collection:},

The typical minimum distance of these codes increases linearly with block length for a fixed rate and fixedj. When used with maximum likelihood decoding on a sufficiently quiet binary-input symmetric channel, the typical probability of decoding error decreases exponentially with block length for a fixed rate and fixedj. A simple but nonoptimum decoding scheme operating directly from the channel a posteriori probabilities is described. Both the equipment complexity and the data-handling capacity in bits per second of this decoder increase approximately linearly with block length. Forj {\textgreater} 3and a sufficiently low rate, the probability of error using this decoder on a binary symmetric channel is shown to decrease at least exponentially with a root of the block length. Some experimental results show that the actual probability of decoding error is much smaller than this theoretical bound.},

	abstract = {Locally testable codes (LTC) are error-correcting codes that have a local tester which can distinguish valid codewords from words that are "far" from all codewords by probing a given word only at a very few (sublinear, typically constant) number of locations. Such codes form the combinatorial backbone of PCPs. A major open problem is whether there exist LTCs with positive rate, constant relative distance and testable with a constant number of queries. In this paper, we present a new approach towards constructing such LTCs using the machinery of high-dimensional expanders. To this end, we consider the Tanner representation of a code, which is specified by a graph and a base code. Informally, our result states that if this graph is part of a high-dimensional expander then the local testability of the code follows from the local testability of the base code. This work unifies and generalizes the known results on testability of the Hadamard, Reed-Muller and lifted codes on the Subspace Complex, all of which are proved via local self correction. However, unlike previous results, constant rounds of self correction do not suffice as the diameter of the underlying test graph can be logarithmically large in a high-dimensional expander and not constant as in all known earlier results. We overcome this technical hurdle by performing iterative self correction with logarithmically many rounds and tightly controlling the error in each iteration using properties of the high-dimensional expander. Given this result, the missing ingredient towards constructing a constant-query LTC with positive rate and constant relative distance is an instantiation of a base code that interacts well with a constant-degree high-dimensional expander.},

This framework allows us to enforce stabilizer commutation, X/Z balancing, finite rate, sparsity, and maximum-degree constraints simultaneously in a CSP that we can then solve numerically. Using a state-of-the-art CSP solver, we obtain convincing evidence for the existence of a satisfiability threshold. Furthermore, the extent of the satisfiable phase increases with the number of qubits. In that phase, finding sparse codes becomes an easy problem. Moreover, we observe that the sparse codes found in the satisfiable phase practically achieve the channel capacity for erasure noise. Our results show that intermediate-size finite-rate sparse quantum codes are easy to find, while also demonstrating a flexible methodology for generating good codes with custom properties. We therefore establish a complete and customizable pipeline for random quantum code discovery that can be geared towards near to mid-term quantum processor layouts.},

The purpose of Majorana fermion codes (MFCs) is to protect quantum information against low-weight fermionic errors, that is, operators acting on sufficiently small subsets of fermionic modes. We examine to what extent MFCs can surpass qubit stabilizer codes in terms of their stability properties. A general construction of 2D MFCs is proposed which combines topological protection based on a macroscopic code distance with protection based on fermionic parity conservation. Finally, we use MFCs to show how to transform any qubit stabilizer code to a weakly self-dual CSS code.},

	abstract = {We establish a unified framework for Majorana-based fault-tolerant quantum computation with Majorana surface codes and Majorana color codes. All logical Clifford gates are implemented with zero time overhead. This is done by introducing a protocol for Pauli product measurements with tetrons and hexons which only requires local 4-Majorana parity measurements. An analogous protocol is used in the fault-tolerant setting, where tetrons and hexons are replaced by Majorana surface code patches, and parity measurements are replaced by lattice surgery, still only requiring local few-Majorana parity measurements. To this end, we discuss twist defects in Majorana fermion surface codes and adapt the technique of twist-based lattice surgery to fermionic codes. Moreover, we propose a new family of codes that we refer to as Majorana color codes, which are obtained by concatenating Majorana surface codes with small Majorana fermion codes. Majorana surface and color codes can be used to decrease the space overhead and stabilizer weight compared to their bosonic counterparts.},

	abstract = {We consider quantum error-correcting subsystem codes whose gauge generators realize a translation-invariant, free-fermion-solvable spin model. In this setting, errors are suppressed by a Hamiltonian whose terms are the gauge generators of the code and whose exact spectrum and eigenstates can be found via a generalized Jordan-Wigner transformation. Such solutions are characterized by the frustration graph of the Hamiltonian: the graph whose vertices are Hamiltonian terms, which are neighboring if the terms anticommute. We provide methods for embedding a given frustration graph in the anticommutation relations of a spin model and present the first known example of an exactly solvable spin model with a two-dimensional free-fermion description and exact topological qubits. This model can be viewed as a free-fermionized version of the two-dimensional Bacon-Shor code. Using graph-theoretic tools to study the unit cell, we give an efficient algorithm for deciding if a given translation-invariant spin model is solvable, and explicitly construct the solution. Further, we examine the energetics of these exactly solvable models from the graph-theoretic perspective and show that the relevant gaps of the spin model correspond to known graph-theoretic quantities: the skew energy and the median eigenvalue of an oriented graph. Finally, we numerically search for models that have large spectral gaps above the ground-state spin configuration and thus exhibit particularly robust thermal suppression of errors. These results suggest that optimal models will have low dimensionality and odd coordination numbers, and that the primary limit to energetic error suppression is the skew energy difference between different symmetry sectors rather than single-particle excitations of the free fermions.},

We introduce fermion-parity-based computation (FPBC): a measurement-based scheme, modeled on Pauli-based computation, that uses efficient classical processing to virtually increase the number of available MZMs and which, given magic state inputs, operates without transformations. FPBC requires all MZM parities to be measurable, but this conflicts with constraints in proposed MZM hardware. We thus introduce a design in which all parities are directly measurable and which is hence well suited for FPBC. While developing FPBC, we identify the "logical braid group" as the fermionic analog of the Clifford group.},

In this work, we introduce a versatile framework of Majorana dimers capturing the intersection of stabilizer and Gaussian Majorana states. This picture allows for an efficient contraction with a simple diagrammatic interpretation and is amenable to analytical study of holographic quantum error-correcting codes. Equipped with this framework, we revisit the recently proposed hyperbolic pentagon code (HyPeC). Relating its logical code basis to Majorana dimers, we efficiently compute boundary-state properties even for the non-Gaussian case of generic logical input. The dimers characterizing these boundary states coincide with discrete bulk geodesics, leading to a geometric picture from which properties of entanglement, quantum error correction, and bulk/boundary operator mapping immediately follow. We also elaborate upon the emergence of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula from our model, which realizes many of the properties of the recent bit thread proposal. Our work thus elucidates the connection among bulk geometry, entanglement, and quantum error correction in AdS/CFT and lays the foundation for new models of holography.},

These quantum memories suffer from purely "fermionic" errors, such as quasiparticle poisoning (QP), that have no analog in conventional platforms with bosonic qubits. In physical realizations where QP dominates, we show that errors can be corrected provided that the poisoning rate is below a threshold of ∼11 \% . When QP is highly suppressed and fermionic bilinear ("bosonic") errors become dominant, we find an error threshold of ∼16 \% , which is much higher than the threshold for spin-based topological memories like the surface code or the color code. In addition, we derive lattice gauge theories to account for measurement errors. These results, together with the inherent error suppression provided by the superconducting gap in physical realizations of the MSCs, makes this a strong candidate for a robust topological quantum memory.},

The space overhead, defined as the ratio between the physical qubits to the number of output magic states, is asymptotically constant, while both the number of input magic states used per output state and the T-gate depth of the circuit scale linearly in the logarithm of the target error δ (up to log⁡log⁡1/δ). Unlike other distillation protocols, this protocol achieves this performance without concatenation and the input magic states are injected at various steps in the circuit rather than all at the start of the circuit. The protocol can be modified to distill magic states for other gates at the third level of the Clifford hierarchy, with the same asymptotic performance. The protocol relies on the construction of weakly self-dual CSS codes with many logical qubits and large distance, allowing us to implement control-SWAPs on multiple qubits. We call this code the "inner code". The control-SWAPs are then used to measure properties of the magic state and detect errors, using another code that we call the "outer code". Alternatively, we use weakly-self dual CSS codes which implement controlled Hadamards for the inner code, reducing circuit depth. We present several specific small examples of this protocol.},

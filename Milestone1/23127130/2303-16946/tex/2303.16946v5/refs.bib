  abstract = {The Gottesman-Knill theorem says that a stabilizer circuit---that is, a quantum circuit consisting solely of controlled-NOT (CNOT), Hadamard, and phase gates---can be simulated efficiently on a classical computer. This paper improves that theorem in several directions. First, by removing the need for Gaussian elimination, we make the simulation algorithm much faster at the cost of a factor of 2 increase in the number of bits needed to represent a state. We have implemented the improved algorithm in a freely available program called CHP (CNOT-Hadamard-phase), which can handle thousands of qubits easily. Second, we show that the problem of simulating stabilizer circuits is complete for the classical complexity class {$\oplus$}L, which means that stabilizer circuits are probably not even universal for classical computation. Third, we give efficient algorithms for computing the inner product between two stabilizer states, putting any n-qubit stabilizer circuit into a ``canonical form'' that requires at most O(n2/logn) gates, and other useful tasks. Fourth, we extend our simulation algorithm to circuits acting on mixed states, circuits containing a limited number of nonstabilizer gates, and circuits acting on general tensor-product initial states but containing only a limited number of measurements.}

  abstract = {We present a general procedure for constructing tensor networks that accurately reproduce holographic states in conformal field theories (CFTs). Given a state in a large-N CFT with a static, semiclassical gravitational dual, we build a tensor network by an iterative series of approximations that eliminate redundant degrees of freedom and minimize the bond dimensions of the resulting network. We argue that the bond dimensions of the tensor network will match the areas of the corresponding bulk surfaces. For ``tree'' tensor networks (i.e., those that are constructed by discretizing spacetime with non\- intersecting Ryu-Takayanagi surfaces), our arguments can be made rigorous using a version of one-shot entanglement distillation in the CFT. Using the known quantum error correcting properties of AdS/CFT, we show that bulk legs can be added to the tensor networks to create holographic quantum error correcting codes. These codes behave similarly to previous holographic tensor network toy models, but describe actual bulk excitations in continuum AdS/CFT. By assuming some natural generalizations of the ``holographic entanglement of purification'' conjecture, we are able to construct tensor networks for more general bulk discretizations, leading to finer-grained networks that partition the information content of a Ryu-Takayanagi surface into tensor-factorized subregions. While the granularity of such a tensor network must be set larger than the string/Planck scales, we expect that it can be chosen to lie well below the AdS scale. However, we also prove a no-go theorem which shows that the bulk-to-boundary maps cannot all be isometries in a tensor network with intersecting Ryu-Takayanagi surfaces.},

We examine to what extent MFCs can surpass qubit stabilizer codes in terms of their stability properties. A general construction of 2D MFCs is proposed that combines topological protection based on a macroscopic code distance with protection based on fermionic parity conservation.

This is puzzling because it contradicts both holographic expectations for the rate of complexification and also action calculations for charged black holes. We trace the discrepancy to an improper treatment of boundary terms when naively doing the dimensional reduction. Once the boundary term is corrected, we find exact agreement with expectations. We comment on the general lessons that this might hold for holographic complexity and beyond.},

We study the limit where the number of fermions erased is large but small compared to the total number of fermions. We compute the price of the quantum error correcting code, defined as the number of physical qubits needed to reconstruct whether a given operator has been acted upon the thermal state or not. By thinking about reconstruction via quantum teleportation, we argue for a bound that relates the price to the ordinary operator size in systems that display so-called detailed size winding [1]. We then find that in SYK the price roughly saturates this bound. Computing the price requires computing modular flowed correlators with respect to the density matrix associated to a subset of fermions. We offer an interpretation of these correlators as probing a quantum extremal surface in the AdS dual of SYK. In the large N limit, the operator algebras associated to subsets of fermions in SYK satisfy half-sided modular inclusion, which is indicative of an emergent Type III1 von Neumann algebra. We discuss the relationship between the emergent algebra of half-sided modular inclusions and bulk symmetry generators.},

Taking the overlap between an eigenstate \${\textbackslash}langle{\textbackslash}Omega{\textbar}\$ of the RG operator with the ground state wave-function \${\textbar}{\textbackslash}Psi{\textbackslash}rangle\$ of \$T\$ (i.e. \${\textbackslash}langle{\textbackslash}Omega{\textbar}{\textbackslash}Psi{\textbackslash}rangle\$) gives rise to partition functions of conformal (including topological) theories in \$D\$ dimensions with categorical symmetry related to \$T\$, realizing a holographic relation discussed in the literature explicitly. We illustrate this in explicit examples at \$D=1,2,3\$. Exact eigenstates of the RG operator can be solved explicitly from (higher) separable Frobenius algebra of the (higher) input fusion category \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{C\}\$ defining the lattice model of \$T\$, and they give the \$D\$ dimensional symmetric TQFTs. Eigenstates corresponding to actual conformal theories describe phase transitions between these topological fixed points. The critical points can be searched numerically and we demonstrate that known critical couplings of \$SU(2)\_k\$ integrable lattice models are numerically recovered from our procedure, alongside a curious tricritical point that we found at \$k=4\$. We demonstrate that the 2+1 D Ising model can also be obtained as a strange correlator with the associated 4D topological order being the 4D toric code. The numerical procedure that we devise to search for the 3D critical temperature is a novel tensor renormalization group algorithm, that fully harnesses the algebraic and geometric properties of the RG operator. Finally since the RG operator is in fact an exact analytic holographic tensor network, we compute ``bulk-boundary'' correlator and compare with AdS/CFT. Promisingly, they are numerically compatible given our accuracy, although further works will be needed to explore the precise connection to the AdS/CFT correspondence.},

Such codes form the combinatorial backbone of PCPs. A major open problem is whether there exist LTCs with positive rate, constant relative distance and testable with a constant number of queries. In this paper, we present a new approach towards constructing such LTCs using the machinery of high-dimensional expanders. To this end, we consider the Tanner representation of a code, which is specified by a graph and a base code. Informally, our result states that if this graph is part of a high-dimensional expander then the local testability of the code follows from the local testability of the base code. This work unifies and generalizes the known results on testability of the Hadamard, Reed-Muller and lifted codes on the Subspace Complex, all of which are proved via local self correction. However, unlike previous results, constant rounds of self correction do not suffice as the diameter of the underlying test graph can be logarithmically large in a high-dimensional expander and not constant as in all known earlier results. We overcome this technical hurdle by performing iterative self correction with logarithmically many rounds and tightly controlling the error in each iteration using properties of the high-dimensional expander. Given this result, the missing ingredient towards constructing a constant-query LTC with positive rate and constant relative distance is an instantiation of a base code that interacts well with a constant-degree high-dimensional expander.},

  abstract = {Since Shor's discovery of an algorithm to factor numbers on a quantum computer in polynomial time, quantum computation has become a subject of immense interest. Unfortunately, one of the key features of quantum computers - the difficulty of describing them on classical computers - also makes it difficult to describe and understand precisely what can be done with them. A formalism describing the evolution of operators rather than states has proven extremely fruitful in understanding an important class of quantum operations. States used in error correction and certain communication protocols can be described by their stabilizer, a group of tensor products of Pauli matrices. Even this simple group structure is sufficient to allow a rich range of quantum effects, although it falls short of the full power of quantum computation.},

Hudson established that for continuous variable systems, the Wigner function of a pure state has no negative values if and only if the state is Gaussian. Turning to mixed states, it might be surmised that only convex combinations of stabilizer states give rise to non-negative Wigner distributions. We refute this conjecture by means of a counter-example. Further, we give an axiomatic characterization which completely fixes the definition of the Wigner function and compare two approaches to stabilizer states for Hilbert spaces of prime-power dimensions.

We benchmark their expressiveness against standard tensor networks, as well as other common circuit architectures, for the 1D and 2D Heisenberg and 1D Fermi-Hubbard models. We find quantum circuit tensor networks to be substantially more expressive than other quantum circuits for these problems, and that they can even be more compact than standard tensor networks.

Most importantly, we demonstrate a finite disorder-averaged approximation ratio of r{$\approx$}0.62 between the variational and ground-state energy of the SYK model for q=4.

Our model enjoys efficient learning analogous to the density matrix renormalization group method, which allows dynamically adjusting dimensions of the tensors and offers an efficient direct sampling approach for generative tasks. We apply our method to generative modeling of several standard data sets including the Bars and Stripes random binary patterns and the MNIST handwritten digits to illustrate the abilities, features, and drawbacks of our model over popular generative models such as the Hopfield model, Boltzmann machines, and generative adversarial networks. Our work sheds light on many interesting directions of future exploration in the development of quantum-inspired algorithms for unsupervised machine learning, which are promisingly possible to realize on quantum devices.}

The result is a unified framework in which classical and quantum computing can benefit from the same theoretical and algorithmic developments, and the same model can be trained classically then transferred to the quantum setting for additional optimization. Tensor network circuits can also provide qubit-efficient schemes in which, depending on the architecture, the number of physical qubits required scales only logarithmically with, or independently of the input or output data sizes. We demonstrate our proposals with numerical experiments, training a discriminative model to perform handwriting recognition using a hybrid quantum-classical optimization procedure that could be carried out on quantum hardware today, and testing the noise resilience of the trained model.},

The method is based on a MERA-like tensor network that can be efficiently and reliably contracted on a noisy quantum computer using a number of qubits that is much smaller than the system size. We prove that the outcome of the contraction is stable to noise and that the estimated energy upper bounds the ground state energy. The stability, which we numerically substantiate, follows from the positivity of operator scaling dimensions under renormalization group flow. The variational upper bound follows from a particular assignment of physical qubits to different locations of the tensor network plus the assumption that the noise model is local. We postulate a scaling law for how well the tensor network can approximate ground states of lattice regulated conformal field theories in d spatial dimensions and provide evidence for the postulate. Under this postulate, a \$O({\textbackslash}log{\textasciicircum}\{d\}(1/{\textbackslash}delta))\$-qubit quantum computer can prepare a valid quantum-mechanical state with energy density \${\textbackslash}delta\$ above the ground state.

  abstract = {The resemblance between the methods used in quantum-many body physics and in machine learning has drawn considerable attention. In particular, tensor networks (TNs) and deep learning architectures bear striking similarities to the extent that TNs can be used for machine learning. Previous results used one-dimensional TNs in image recognition, showing limited scalability and flexibilities. In this work, we train two-dimensional hierarchical TNs to solve image recognition problems, using a training algorithm derived from the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz. This approach introduces mathematical connections among quantum many-body physics, quantum information theory, and machine learning. While keeping the TN unitary in the training phase, TN states are defined, which encode classes of images into quantum many-body states. We study the quantum features of the TN states, including quantum entanglement and fidelity. We find these quantities could be properties that characterize the image classes, as well as the machine learning tasks.},

For q=2, it describes free particles and is nonchaotic in the many-body sense, while for q{$>$}2 it is strongly interacting and exhibits many-body chaos. In this work we study the entanglement entropy (EE) of the SYKq models for a bipartition of N real or complex fermions into subsystems containing 2m real/m complex fermions and N-2m/N-m fermions in the remainder. For the free model SYK2, we obtain an analytic expression for the EE, derived from the {$\beta$}-Jacobi random matrix ensemble. Furthermore, we use the replica trick and path-integral formalism to show that the EE is maximal when one subsystem is small, i.e., m{$\ll$}N, for arbitrary q. We also demonstrate that the EE for the SYK4 model is noticeably smaller than the Page value when the two subsystems are comparable in size, i.e., m/N is O(1). Finally, we explore the EE for a model with both SYK2 and SYK4 interactions and find a crossover from SYK2 (low-temperature) to SYK4 (high-temperature) behavior as we vary energy.}

It it tractable in the large-N limit, where the classical variable is a bilocal fermion bilinear. The model becomes strongly interacting at low energies where it develops an emergent conformal symmetry. We study two- and four-point functions of the fundamental fermions. This provides the spectrum of physical excitations for the bilocal field. The emergent conformal symmetry is a reparametrization symmetry, which is spontaneously broken to SL(2,R), leading to zero modes. These zero modes are lifted by a small residual explicit breaking, which produces an enhanced contribution to the four-point function. This contribution displays a maximal Lyapunov exponent in the chaos region (out-of-time-ordered correlator). We expect these features to be universal properties of large-N quantum mechanics systems with emergent reparametrization symmetry. This article is largely based on talks given by Kitaev, which motivated us to work out the details of the ideas described there., This article appears in the following collection:}

To address this discrepancy, a quantum-classical hybrid optimization scheme known as `the quantum variational eigensolver' was developed (Peruzzo et al 2014 Nat. Commun. 5 4213) with the philosophy that even minimal quantum resources could be made useful when used in conjunction with classical routines. In this work we extend the general theory of this algorithm and suggest algorithmic improvements for practical implementations. Specifically, we develop a variational adiabatic ansatz and explore unitary coupled cluster where we establish a connection from second order unitary coupled cluster to universal gate sets through a relaxation of exponential operator splitting. We introduce the concept of quantum variational error suppression that allows some errors to be suppressed naturally in this algorithm on a pre-threshold quantum device. Additionally, we analyze truncation and correlated sampling in Hamiltonian averaging as ways to reduce the cost of this procedure. Finally, we show how the use of modern derivative free optimization techniques can offer dramatic computational savings of up to three orders of magnitude over previously used optimization techniques.},

In this construction, the ordinary entanglement renormalization flow given by the class of tensor networks known as the Multi Scale Entanglement Renormalization Ansatz (MERA), is supplemented by an additional entanglement structure at the length scale fixed by the temperature. The network comprises two copies of a MERA circuit with a fixed number of layers and a pure matrix product state which joins both copies by entangling the infrared degrees of freedom of both MERA networks. The entanglement distribution within this bridge state defines reduced density operators on both sides which cause analogous effects to the presence of a black hole horizon when computing the entanglement entropy at finite temperature in the AdS/CFT correspondence. The entanglement and correlations during the thermalization process of a system after a quantum quench are also analyzed. To this end, a full tensor network representation of the action of local unitary operations on the bridge state is proposed. This amounts to a tensor network which grows in size by adding succesive layers of bridge states. Finally, we discuss on the holographic interpretation of the tensor network through a notion of distance within the network which emerges from its entanglement distribution.},

The Tensor Train format regularizes the model and lets you control the number of underlying parameters. To train the model, we develop a stochastic Riemannian optimization procedure, which allows us to fit tensors with 2{\textasciicircum}160 entries.

The entire tensor network is an encoder for a quantum error-correcting code, where the bulk and boundary degrees of freedom may be identified as logical and physical degrees of freedom respectively. These models capture key features of entanglement in the AdS/CFT correspondence; in particular, the Ryu-Takayanagi formula and the negativity of tripartite information are obeyed exactly in many cases. That bulk logical operators can be represented on multiple boundary regions mimics the Rindlerwedge reconstruction of boundary operators from bulk operators, realizing explicitly the quantum error-correcting features of AdS/CFT recently proposed in [1].},

Here we present an alternative approach that greatly reduces the requirements for coherent evolution and combine this method with a new approach to state preparation based on ans{\"a}tze and classical optimization. We implement the algorithm by combining a highly reconfigurable photonic quantum processor with a conventional computer.

Our approach is based on renormalization group (RG) ideas and takes a resource oriented perspective. We report four main results. First, we argue for the ``weak area law'': any gapped phase with a unique ground state on every closed manifold obeys the area law. Second, we introduce an RG based classification scheme and give a detailed argument that all phases within the classification scheme obey the area law. Third, we define a special subclass of gapped phases, topological quantum liquids, which captures all examples of current physical relevance, and we rigorously show that topological quantum liquids obey an area law. Fourth, we show that all topological quantum liquids have MERA representations which achieve unit overlap with the ground state in the thermodynamic limit and which have a bond dimension scaling with system size L as eclogd(1+{$\delta$})(L) for all {$\delta>$}0. For example, we show that chiral phases in d=2 dimensions have an approximate MERA with bond dimension eclog2(1+{$\delta$})(L). We discuss extensively a number of subsidiary ideas and results necessary to make the main arguments, including field theory constructions. While our argument for the general area law rests on physically motivated assumptions (which we make explicit) and is therefore not rigorous, we may conclude that ``conventional'' gapped phases obey the area law and that any gapped phase which violates the area law must be a dragon.}

  abstract = {Theoretical research into many-body quantum systems has mostly focused on regular structures which have a small, simple unit cell and where a vanishingly small fraction~of~the pairs of the constituents directly interact. Motivated by advances in control over the pairwise interactions in many-body simulators, we determine the fate of spin systems on more general, arbitrary graphs. Placing the minimum possible constraints on the underlying graph, we prove how, with certainty in the thermodynamic limit, such systems behave like a single collective spin. We thus understand the emergence of complex many-body physics as dependent on `exceptional', geometrically constrained structures such as the low-dimensional, regular ones found in nature. Within the space of dense graphs we identify hitherto unknown exceptions via their inhomogeneity and observe how complexity is heralded in these systems by entanglement and highly non-uniform correlation functions. Our work paves the way for the discovery and exploitation of a whole class of geometries which can host uniquely complex phases of matter.},

The method applies to both finite and inhomogeneous systems, and it is based on two ideas: (a) a representation for density operators which extends that of matrix product states to mixed states; (b) an algorithm to approximate the evolution (in real or imaginary time) of matrix product states which is variational.}

It is also the ansatz underlying entanglement renormalization, a novel coarse-graining scheme for many-body quantum systems on a lattice.}

  abstract = {We propose a real-space renormalization group (RG) transformation for quantum systems on a D-dimensional lattice. The transformation partially disentangles a block of sites before coarse-graining it into an effective site. Numerical simulations with the ground state of a 1D lattice at criticality show that the resulting coarse-grained sites require a Hilbert space dimension that does not grow with successive RG transformations. As a result we can address, in a quasi-exact way, tens of thousands of quantum spins with a computational effort that scales logarithmically in the system's size. The calculations unveil that ground state entanglement in extended quantum systems is organized in layers corresponding to different length scales. At a quantum critical point, each relevant length scale makes an equivalent contribution to the entanglement of a block.}

  abstract = {Unitary t-designs are a ubiquitous tool in many research areas, including randomized benchmarking, quantum process tomography, and scrambling. Despite the intensive efforts of many researchers, little is known about unitary t-designs with t{$\geq$}3 in the literature. We show that the multiqubit Clifford group in any even prime-power dimension is not only a unitary 2-design, but also a 3-design. Moreover, it is a minimal 3-design except for dimension 4. As an immediate consequence, any orbit of pure states of the multiqubit Clifford group forms a complex projective 3-design; in particular, the set of stabilizer states forms a 3-design. In addition, our study is helpful in studying higher moments of the Clifford group, which are useful in many research areas ranging from quantum information science to signal processing. Furthermore, we reveal a surprising connection between unitary 3-designs and the physics of discrete phase spaces and thereby offer a simple explanation of why no discrete Wigner function is covariant with respect to the multiqubit Clifford group, which is of intrinsic interest in studying quantum computation.}

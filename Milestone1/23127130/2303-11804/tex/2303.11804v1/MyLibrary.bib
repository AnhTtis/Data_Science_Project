	abstract = {Consumer direct delivery of packages ordered over the Internet has grown at well over 25 \% per year over the past 10 years and now accounts for over \$100 billion in sales in the U.S. alone. Retailers have rushed to capitalize on what has commonly been labeled multi-channel retailing, while logisticians have faced a challenge in devising efficient methods of delivering billions of packages to customer homes. Inefficient deliveries in this “last mile” of the supply chain have led to numerous business collapses as well as a substantial increase in delivery costs. We present a study which examines the effect of two factors (customer density and delivery window length) on the overall efficiency of the delivery route. Data are collected based on empirically derived settings from interviews with several practicing managers. Results provide insight for logistics and marketing managers who must balance customer desires for convenience with business desires for efficiency. The data show that offering a 3 hour delivery window is 30–45\% more expensive than offering unattended (9 hour delivery window) delivery. The results provide a tool for managers to address the tradeoffs between various settings for the independent variables (customer density and delivery window length) and the overall route efficiency.},

	volume = {53},
	abstract = {Same-day delivery for online purchases is a recent trend in online retail. We introduce a multi-vehicle dynamic pickup and delivery problem with time constraints that incorporates key features associated with same-day delivery logistics. To make better informed decisions, our solution approach incorporates information about future requests into routing decisions. We also introduce an analytical result that identifies when it is beneficial for vehicles to wait at the depot. We present a wide range of computational experiments that demonstrate the value of our approach. The results show that more requests can be filled when time windows are evenly spread throughout the day compared to when many requests' time windows occur late in the day. However, the anticipation of future requests is most valuable when many requests' time windows occur late in the day. As a result of increased flexibility, experiments also demonstrate that the value of anticipating the future decreases when the number of vehicles or the arrival rate of requests increases.The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/trsc.2016.0732.},

In our problem variant these time windows have a special structure, namely they are non-overlapping and each time window holds several customers. This is a reasonable assumption for Attended Home Delivery services. Sweep algorithms are known as simple, yet effective heuristics for the classical capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem. We propose variants of the sweep algorithm that are not only able to deal with time windows, but also exploit the additional structure of the time windows in a {cVRPsTW}. Afterwards we suggest local improvement heuristics to decrease our objective function even further. A carefully constructed benchmark set that resembles real-world data is used to prove the efficacy of our algorithms in a computational study.},

To this end, we present a dynamic vehicle routing problem with heterogeneous fleets. Customers order goods over the course of the day. These goods are delivered either by a drone or by a regular transportation vehicle within a delivery deadline. Drones are faster, but have a limited capacity as well as require charging after use. In the same-day context, vehicle capacity is not a constraint, but vehicles are slow due to urban traffic. To decide whether an order is delivered by a drone or by a vehicle, we present a policy function approximation based on geographical districting. Our computational study reveals two major implications. First, geographical districting is highly effective increasing the expected number of same-day deliveries. Second, a combination of drone and vehicle fleets may significantly reduce the required delivery resources.},

	title = {Preemptive depot returns for dynamic same-day delivery},
	abstract = {In this paper, we explore same-day delivery routing and particularly how same-day delivery vehicles can better integrate dynamic requests into delivery routes by taking advantage of preemptive depot returns. A preemptive depot return occurs when a delivery vehicle returns to the depot before delivering all of the packages currently on-board the vehicle. In this paper, we assume that a vehicle serves requests in a particular delivery area. Beginning the day with some known deliveries, the vehicle seeks to serve the known requests as well as additional new requests that are received throughout the day. To serve the new requests, the vehicle must return to the depot to pick up the packages for delivery. In contrast to previous work on same-day delivery routing, in this paper, we allow the vehicle to return to the depot before serving all loaded packages. To solve the problem, we couple an approximation of the value of choosing any particular subset of requests for delivery with a routing heuristic. Our approximation procedure is based on approximate dynamic programming and allows us to capture both the current value of a subset selection decision and its impact on future rewards. Using extensive computational tests, we demonstrate the value of preemptive depot returns and the value of the proposed approximation scheme in supporting preemptive returns. We also identify characteristics of instances for which preemptive depot returns are most likely to offer improvement.},

It proposes online stochastic algorithms that combine the frameworks of online and stochastic optimization. Online stochastic algorithms differ from traditional a priori methods such as stochastic programming and Markov Decision Processes by focusing on the instance data that is revealed over time. The paper proposes three main algorithms: expectation E, consensus C, and regret R. They all make online decisions by approximating, for each decision, the solution to a multi-stage stochastic program using an exterior sampling method and a polynomial number of samples. The algorithms were evaluated experimentally and theoretically. The experimental results were obtained on three applications of different nature: packet scheduling, multiple vehicle routing with time windows, and multiple vehicle dispatching. The theoretical results show that, under assumptions which seem to hold on these, and other, applications, algorithm E has an expected constant loss compared to the offline optimal solution. Algorithm R reduces the number of optimizations by a factor {\textbar}R{\textbar}, where R is the number of requests, and has an expected ρ(1+o(1)) loss when the regret gives a ρ-approximation to the offline problem.},

	shorttitle = {Dynamic Vehicle Routing},
	abstract = {We present a literature review of and modeling framework for
dynamic vehicle routing problems ({DVRPs}). Our review yields two key findings. First, {DVRP} papers often lack models of the underlying stochastic and dynamic problems that they study. Second, the overwhelming majority of {DVRP} solution methods employ route plans, a potential course of action to follow for future decision-making, e.g., a path through a set of realized service requests or a customer sequence coupled with various quantities required to implement heuristic decision-making methods. Essentially, the {DVRP} literature lacks models that connect real-world applications with solution methods. To bridge this gap, we introduce a route-based {MDP} model that extends the conventional {MDP} model for dynamic and stochastic optimization problems by redefining the conventional action space to operate on route plans. Under an easily satisfiable condition, we show route-based {MDPs} are equivalent to the conventional {MDP} model. We anticipate route-based {MDPs} will facilitate more scientific rigor in {DVRP} studies, provide researchers with a common modeling language, allow for better inquiry, and improve classification and description of solution methods. Using examples from the literature, we illustrate the value of connecting application and solution methodology via route-based {MDPs}.},

	title = {On Modeling Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problems},
	abstract = {Operations research requires models that unambiguously deﬁne problems and support the generation and presentation of solution methodology. In the ﬁeld of dynamic routing, capturing the joint evolution of complex sequential routing decisions and stochastic information is challenging, leading to a situation where rigorous methods have outpaced rigorous models and thus making it difﬁcult for researchers to engage in rigorous science. We provide a modeling framework that strongly connects application with method and that leverages the rich body of route-based planning and optimization. As a generalization of conventional Markov decision processes ({MDPs}), route-based {MDPs} augment the state space, action space, and reward structure to include routing information. Accordingly, route-based {MDPs} make it conceptually easier to connect dynamic routing problems with the route-based methods typically used to solve them – construct and revise routes as new information is learned. We anticipate route-based {MDPs} will facilitate more scientiﬁc rigor in dynamic routing studies, provide researchers with a common modeling language, allow for better inquiry, and improve classiﬁcation and description of solution methods.},

	abstract = {Recent research reveals that pro-active real-time routing approaches that use stochastic knowledge about future requests can significantly improve solution quality compared to approaches that simply integrate new requests upon arrival. Many of these approaches assume that request arrivals on different days follow an identical pattern. Thus, they define and apply a single profile of past request days to anticipate future request arrivals. In many real-world applications, however, different days may follow different patterns. Moreover, the pattern of the current day may not be known beforehand, and may need to be identified in real-time during the day. In such cases, applying approaches that use a single profile is not promising. In this paper, we propose a new pro-active real-time routing approach that applies multiple profiles. These profiles are generated by grouping together days with a similar pattern of request arrivals. For each combination of identified profiles, stochastic knowledge about future request arrivals is derived in an offline step. During the day, the approach repeatedly evaluates characteristics of request arrivals and selects a suitable combination of profiles. The performance of the new approach is evaluated in computational experiments in direct comparison with a previous approach that applies only a single profile. Computational results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the previous one. We analyze further potential for improvement by comparing the approach with an omniscient variant that knows the actual pattern in advance. Based on the results, managerial implications that allow for a practical application of the new approach are provided.},

In this study, the strategies are tested in a constructive-deconstructive heuristic for the dynamic pickup and delivery problem with hard time windows and random travel times. Comparisons of the solution quality provided by these strategies to a more conventional approach were performed on randomly generated instances up to 100 requests with static and dynamic (time-dependent) travel times and different degrees of dynamism.

We develop a sample-scenario routing strategy to accommodate a variety of potential time realizations while designing and updating the routes. Our experiments on a breadth of instances show that advance time related information, if used intelligently, can yield benefits. Furthermore, we show that it is beneficial to tailor the consensus function that is used in the sample-scenario approach to the specifics of the problem setting.

	abstract = {An Online Vehicle Routing Problem is a formation of Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with re-routing strategy to resolve the problem of inefficient vehicle routing caused by traffic congestion. A flexible delivery rerouting strategy is proposed, which aims at reducing the risk of late delivery. The method of terminating an exploration in a solution by the original {ABC} algorithm, when the solution is trapped in local optima, is to abandon the solution after specific tolerance limits are set. The phenomenon of local optimal traps will be repeated rapidly after a lengthy recursive process and will eventually result in a low quality solution, with a more complex combinatorial problem when the capability of the exploration is restricted by an inflexible termination criterion. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel scheme using a Multiple Colonies Artificial Bee Colony algorithm. The designs of the outstanding bee selection for colony communication show it to be superior in exploitation. The performance of the proposed algorithm is examined through by Capacitated Vehicle Routing instances and a case study, and the results indicate the potential of using real time information for data-driven vehicle scheduling.},

To maximize the expected rewards collected, the traveler must determine which locations to visit and how long to wait in queues at each location. We formally model the problem as a Markov decision process with the objective of maximizing the expected collected rewards. We investigate the existence of optimal control limits and examine conditions under which certain actions cannot be optimal. To solve the problem, we propose an approximate dynamic programming approach based on rollout algorithms. The method introduces a two-stage heuristic estimation that we refer to as compound rollout. In the first stage, the algorithm decides whether to stay at the current location or go to another location. If departing the current location, it chooses the next location in the second stage. We demonstrate the value of our modeling and solution approaches by comparing the dynamic policies to a-priori-route solutions with recourse actions.The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/trsc.2017.0761.},

In order to exploit the potential of cost-savings embedded in {CTP}, appropriate request exchange mechanisms have to be developed. In this paper, the dynamic {CTP} problem of a coalition of freight forwarders serving full-truckload transport requests is studied. Two rolling horizon planning approaches are proposed to solve the dynamic routing problems. It is analyzed how the planning results, in particular the cost reduction realized by {CTP}, are influenced by different planning settings. Computational experiments show that the planning results of {CTP} are considerably superior to those obtained by isolated planning, and the realized cost-savings in percentage remain relatively constant, independently of the test settings.},

We then apply approximate linear programming ({ALP}) to overcome the {DP}'s curse of dimensionality, obtain a semi-infinite linear programming lower bound, and discuss its tractability. We also analyze a rollout version of the price-directed policy implied by our {ALP} and derive worst-case guarantees for its performance. Our computational study demonstrates the quality of a heuristically modified rollout policy using a computationally effective a posteriori bound.},

The classical {VRP} consists of determining a set of routes starting and ending at a depot that provide service to a set of customers. Stochastic demands are only revealed when the vehicle arrives at the customer location; dynamic requests mean that new orders from previously unknown customers can be received and scheduled over time. The variable neighborhood search algorithm ({VNS}) proposed in this study can be extended by sampling for stochastic scenarios and adapted for the dynamic setting. We use standard sets of benchmark instances to evaluate our algorithms. When applying sampling based {VNS}, on average we were able to improve results obtained by a classical {VNS} by 4.39 \%. Individual instances could be improved by up to 8.12 \%. In addition, the proposed {VNS} framework matches 32 out of 40 best known solutions and provides one new best solution. In the dynamic case, {VNS} improves on existing results and provides new best solutions for 7 out of 21 instances. Finally, this study offers results for stochastic and dynamic scenarios. Our experiments show that the sampling based dynamic {VNS} provides better results when the demand deviation is small, and reduces the excess route duration by 45–90 \%.},

	title = {Dynamic Pricing for Same-Day Delivery Routing},
	abstract = {An increasing number of e-commerce retailers offers same-day delivery. To deliver the ordered goods, providers dynamically dispatch a fleet of vehicles transporting the goods from the warehouse to the customers. In many cases, retailers offer different delivery deadline options, from four-hour delivery up to next-hour delivery. Due to the deadlines, vehicles often only deliver a few orders per trip. The overall number of served orders within the delivery horizon is small and the revenue low. As a result, many companies currently struggle to conduct same-day delivery cost-efficiently. In this paper, we show how dynamic pricing methods are able to substantially increase both revenue as well as the number of customers served the same day. Dynamic pricing incentivizes customers to select delivery deadline options efficiently for the fleet to fulfill. This maintains the fleet’s flexibility to serve more future orders. We model the according dynamic pricing and routing problem as Markov decision process ({MDP}). To determine suitable stateand option-dependent prices, the state-dependent opportunity costs per customer and option are required. To this end, we develop a guided value function approximation ({VFA}) approximating the opportunity costs for every state and delivery option with respect to the fleet’s flexibility. As an offline method, the {VFA} is able to determine suitable prices instantly when a customer orders. In an extensive computational study, we compare the {VFA} with a policy based on fixed prices and with conventional temporal and geographical pricing policies. The {VFA} outperforms the benchmark policies significantly leading to both a higher revenue and more customers served the same day.},

	abstract = {Due to new business models and technological advances, dynamic vehicle routing is gaining increasing interest. Especially solving dynamic vehicle routing problems with stochastic customer requests becomes increasingly important, for example, in e-commerce and same-day delivery. Solving these problems is challenging, because it requires optimization along two dimensions. First, as a reaction to new customer requests, current routing plans need to be reoptimized. Second, potential future requests need to be anticipated in current decision making. Decisions need to be derived in real-time. The limited time often prohibits extensive optimization in both dimensions and the question arises how to utilize the limited calculation time effectively. In this paper, we analyze the merits of reactive route reoptimization and anticipation for a dynamic vehicle routing problem with stochastic requests. To this end, we compare an existing method from each dimension as well a policy allowing for a tunable combination of the two approaches. We show how the appropriate optimization combination is strongly connected to the degree of dynamism, the percentage of unknown requests. We also show that our combination does not provide significant benefit compared to the respectively best optimization dimension.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new neural architecture to learn the conditional probability of an output sequence with elements that are discrete tokens corresponding to positions in an input sequence. Such problems cannot be trivially addressed by existent approaches such as sequence-to-sequence [1] and Neural Turing Machines [2], because the number of target classes in each step of the output depends on the length of the input, which is variable. Problems such as sorting variable sized sequences, and various combinatorial optimization problems belong to this class. Our model solves the problem of variable size output dictionaries using a recently proposed mechanism of neural attention. It differs from the previous attention attempts in that, instead of using attention to blend hidden units of an encoder to a context vector at each decoder step, it uses attention as a pointer to select a member of the input sequence as the output. We call this architecture a Pointer Net (Ptr-Net). We show Ptr-Nets can be used to learn approximate solutions to three challenging geometric problems – ﬁnding planar convex hulls, computing Delaunay triangulations, and the planar Travelling Salesman Problem – using training examples alone. Ptr-Nets not only improve over sequence-to-sequence with input attention, but also allow us to generalize to variable size output dictionaries. We show that the learnt models generalize beyond the maximum lengths they were trained on. We hope our results on these tasks will encourage a broader exploration of neural learning for discrete problems.},

On capacitated {VRP}, our approach outperforms classical heuristics and Google’s {OR}-Tools on medium-sized instances in solution quality with comparable computation time (after training). We demonstrate how our approach can handle problems with split delivery and explore the effect of such deliveries on the solution quality.

	abstract = {Ride-sharing, or carpooling, systems with autonomous vehicles will provide efficient and reliable urban mobility on demand. In this work we present a method for dynamic vehicle routing that leverages historical data to improve the performance of a network of self-driving taxis. In particular, we describe a constrained optimization method capable of assigning requests to autonomous vehicles in an informed way, to minimize the expected cost of serving both current and future travel requests. We allow several passengers with independent trips to share a vehicle and allow vehicles to pick additional passengers as they progress through their route. Based on historical data, we compute a probability distribution over future demand. Then, samples from the learned probability distribution are incorporated into a decoupled vehicle routing and passenger assignment method to take into account the predicted future demand. This method consists of three steps, namely pruning of feasible trips, assignment of trips to vehicles and rebalancing of idle vehicles. We show the benefits and trade-offs of this predictive approach in an experimental evaluation with over three million rides extracted from a dataset of taxi trips in New York City. Our method produces routes and assignments that, in expectation, reduce the travel and waiting times for passengers, with respect to a purely reactive approach. Besides the mobility on demand application, the method we present is general and could also be applied to other multi-task multi-vehicle assignment and routing problems.},

Thus, the customers must be chosen based on their associated revenue minus the traveling cost to reach them. We introduce a branch-and-price approach to address this problem where lower bounds are computed by solving the linear programming relaxation of a set packing formulation, using column generation.

	abstract = {This paper presents a method for solving the multi-depot location-routing problem ({MDLRP}). Since several unrealistic assumptions, such as homogeneous fleet type and unlimited number of available vehicles, are typically made concerning this problem, a mathematical formulation is given in which these assumptions are relaxed. Since the inherent complexity of the {LRP} problem makes it impossible to solve the problem on a larger scale, the original problem is divided into two sub-problems, i.e., the location-allocation problem, and the general vehicle routing problem, respectively. Each sub-problem is then solved in a sequential and iterative manner by the simulated annealing algorithm embedded in the general framework for the problem-solving procedure. Test problems from the literature and newly created problems are used to test the proposed method. The results indicate that this method performs well in terms of the solution quality and run time consumed. In addition, the setting of parameters throughout the solution procedure for obtaining quick and favorable solutions is also suggested.
Scope and purpose
In many logistic environments managers must make decisions such as location for distribution centers ({DC}), allocation of customers to each service area, and transportation plans connecting customers. The location-routing problems ({LRPs}) are, hence, defined to find the optimal number and locations of the {DCs}, simultaneously with the vehicle schedules and distribution routes so as to minimize the total system costs. This paper proposes a decomposition-based method for solving the {LRP} with multiple depots, multiple fleet types, and limited number of vehicles for each different vehicle type. The solution procedure developed is very straightforward conceptually, and the results obtained are comparable with other heuristic methods. In addition, the setting of parameters throughout the solution procedure for obtaining quick and favorable solutions is also suggested.},

It is desired to find a way to assign stations to trucks in such a manner that station demands are satisfied and total mileage covered by the fleet is a minimum A procedure based on a linear programming formulation is given for obtaining a near optimal solution. The calculations may be readily performed by hand or by an automatic digital computing machine. No practical applications of the method have been made as yet.

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel three-phase heuristic/algorithmic approach for the multi-depot routing problem with time windows and heterogeneous vehicles. It has been derived from embedding a heuristic-based clustering algorithm within a {VRPTW} optimization framework. To this purpose, a rigorous {MILP} mathematical model for the {VRPTW} problem is first introduced. Likewise other optimization approaches, the new formulation can efficiently solve case studies involving at most 25 nodes to optimality. To overcome this limitation, a preprocessing stage clustering nodes together is initially performed to yield a more compact cluster-based {MILP} problem formulation. In this way, a hierarchical hybrid procedure involving one heuristic and two algorithmic phases was developed. Phase I aims to identifying a set of cost-effective feasible clusters while Phase {II} assigns clusters to vehicles and sequences them on each tour by using the cluster-based {MILP} formulation. Ordering nodes within clusters and scheduling vehicle arrival times at customer locations for each tour through solving a small {MILP} model is finally performed at Phase {III}. Numerous benchmark problems featuring different sizes, clustered/random customer locations and time window distributions have been solved at acceptable {CPU} times.},

	abstract = {Ride-sharing services are transforming urban mobility by providing timely and convenient transportation to anybody, anywhere, and anytime. These services present enormous potential for positive societal impacts with respect to pollution, energy consumption, congestion, etc. Current mathematical models, however, do not fully address the potential of ride-sharing. Recently, a large-scale study highlighted some of the benefits of car pooling but was limited to static routes with two riders per vehicle (optimally) or three (with heuristics). We present a more general mathematical model for real-time high-capacity ride-sharing that (i) scales to large numbers of passengers and trips and (ii) dynamically generates optimal routes with respect to online demand and vehicle locations. The algorithm starts from a greedy assignment and improves it through a constrained optimization, quickly returning solutions of good quality and converging to the optimal assignment over time. We quantify experimentally the tradeoff between fleet size, capacity, waiting time, travel delay, and operational costs for low- to medium-capacity vehicles, such as taxis and van shuttles. The algorithm is validated with ∼3 million rides extracted from the New York City taxicab public dataset. Our experimental study considers ride-sharing with rider capacity of up to 10 simultaneous passengers per vehicle. The algorithm applies to fleets of autonomous vehicles and also incorporates rebalancing of idling vehicles to areas of high demand. This framework is general and can be used for many real-time multivehicle, multitask assignment problems.},

One approach, sample-scenario planning, offers the potential for higher-quality solutions, but at the expense of greater computational effort. On the other hand, anticipatory insertion offers reduced computation and increased managerial ease, but with the potential for reduced solution quality due to restrictions on solution structure. Our results show that anticipatory insertion can often match the quality of sample-scenario planning, particularly when the degree of dynamism is low.},

	abstract = {Many real-world vehicle routing problems are dynamic optimization problems, with customer requests arriving over time, requiring a repeated reoptimization. In this paper, we consider a dynamic vehicle routing problem where one additional customer arrives at a beforehand unknown location when the vehicles are already under way. Our objective is to maximize the probability that the additional customer can be integrated into one of the otherwise fixed tours without violating time constraints. This is achieved by letting the vehicles wait at suitable locations during their tours, thus influencing the position of the vehicles at the time when the new customer arrives. For the cases of one and two vehicles, we derive theoretical results about the best waiting strategies. The general problem is shown to be {NP}-complete. Several deterministic waiting strategies and an evolutionary algorithm to optimize the waiting strategy are proposed and compared empirically. It is demonstrated that a proper waiting strategy can significantly increase the probability of being able to service the additional customer, at the same time reducing the average detour to serve that customer.},

	doi = {10.1109/IROS.2018.8593743},
	abstract = {Recent developments in Mobility-on-Demand ({MoD}) systems have demonstrated the potential of road vehicles as an efficient mode of urban transportation Newly developed algorithms can compute vehicle routes in real-time for batches of requests and allow for multiple requests to share vehicles. These algorithms have primarily focused on optimally producing vehicle schedules to pick up and drop off requests. The redistribution of idle vehicles to areas of high demand, known as rebalancing, on the contrary has received little attention in the context of ride-sharing. In this paper, we present a method to rebalance idle vehicles in a ride-sharing enabled {MoD} fleet. This method consists of an algorithm to optimally partition the fleet operating area into rebalancing regions, an algorithm to determine a real-time demand estimate for every region using incoming requests, and an algorithm to optimize the assignment of idle vehicles to these rebalancing regions using an integer linear program. Evaluation with historical taxi data from Manhattan shows that we can service 99.8\% of taxi requests in Manhattan using 3000 vehicles with an average waiting time of 57.4 seconds and an average in-car delay of 13.7 seconds. Moreover, we can achieve a higher service rate using 2000 vehicles than prior work achieved with 3000. Furthermore, with a fleet of 3000 vehicles, we reduce the average travel delay by 86\%, the average waiting time by 37\%, and the amount of ignored requests by 95\% compared to earlier work at the expense of an increased distance travelled by the fleet.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.07893},
	abstract = {The goal of this paper is to investigate a decision support system for vehicle routing, where the routing engine learns from the subjective decisions that human planners have made in the past, rather than optimizing a distance-based objective criterion. This is an alternative to the practice of formulating a custom {VRP} for every company with its own routing requirements. Instead, we assume the presence of past vehicle routing solutions over similar sets of customers, and learn to make similar choices. The approach is based on the concept of learning a first-order Markov model, which corresponds to a probabilistic transition matrix, rather than a deterministic distance matrix. This nevertheless allows us to use existing arc routing {VRP} software in creating the actual route plans. For the learning, we explore different schemes to construct the probabilistic transition matrix. Our results on a use-case with a small transportation company show that our method is able to generate results that are close to the manually created solutions, without needing to characterize all constraints and sub-objectives explicitly. Even in the case of changes in the client sets, our method is able to find solutions that are closer to the actual route plans than when using distances, and hence, solutions that would require fewer manual changes to transform into the actual route plan.},

This problem is known as the Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem ({MDVRP}), and it typically includes two sequential and correlated stages: (a) the assignment map of customers to depots, and (b) the corresponding design of the distribution routes. Most of the existing work in the literature has focused on minimizing distance-based distribution costs while satisfying a number of capacity constraints. However, no attention has been given so far to potential variations in demands due to the fitness of the customer-depot mapping in the case of heterogeneous depots. In this paper, we consider this realistic version of the problem in which the depots are heterogeneous in terms of their commercial offer and customers show different willingness to consume depending on how well the assigned depot fits their preferences. Thus, we assume that different customer-depot assignment maps will lead to different customer-expenditure levels. As a consequence, market-segmentation strategies need to be considered in order to increase sales and total income while accounting for the distribution costs. To solve this extension of the {MDVRP}, we propose a hybrid approach that combines statistical learning techniques with a metaheuristic framework. First, a set of predictive models is generated from historical data. These statistical models allow estimating the demand of any customer depending on the assigned depot. Then, the estimated expenditure of each customer is included as part of an enriched objective function as a way to better guide the stochastic local search inside the metaheuristic framework. A set of computational experiments contribute to illustrate our approach and how the extended {MDVRP} considered here differs in terms of the proposed solutions from the traditional one.},

The problem consists of determining the routes to be performed to fulfill the demand of the customers by satisfying, for each route, the associated capacity and maximum duration constraints. The objective is to minimize the sum of the traveling costs related to the performed routes.

	abstract = {We consider a dynamic vehicle routing problem with time windows and stochastic customers ({DS}-{VRPTW}), such that customers may request for services as vehicles have already started their tours. To solve this problem, the goal is to provide a decision rule for choosing, at each time step, the next action to perform in light of known requests and probabilistic knowledge on requests likelihood. We introduce a new decision rule, called Global Stochastic Assessment ({GSA}) rule for the {DS}-{VRPTW}, and we compare it with existing decision rules, such as {MSA}. In particular, we show that {GSA} fully integrates nonanticipativity constraints so that it leads to better decisions in our stochastic context. We describe a new heuristic approach for efficiently approximating our {GSA} rule. We introduce a new waiting strategy. Experiments on dynamic and stochastic benchmarks, which include instances of different degrees of dynamism, show that not only our approach is competitive with
state-of-the-art methods, but also enables to compute meaningful offline solutions to fully dynamic problems where absolutely no a priori customer request is provided.},

	abstract = {Parcel services route vehicles to pick up parcels in the service area. Pickup requests occur dynamically during the day and are unknown before their actual request. Because of working hour restrictions, service vehicles only have a limited time to serve dynamic requests. As a result, not all requests can be confirmed. To achieve an overall high number of confirmed requests, dispatchers have to budget their time effectively by anticipating future requests. To determine the value of a decision, i.e., the expected number of future confirmations given a point of time and remaining free time budget, we present an anticipatory time budgeting heuristic ({ATB}) drawing on methods of approximate dynamic programming. {ATB} frequently simulates a problem’s realization to subsequently approximate the values for every vector of point of time and free time budget to achieve an approximation of an optimal decision policy. Since the number of vectors is vast, we introduce the dynamic lookup table ({DLT}), a general approach adaptively partitioning the vector space to the approximation process. Compared with state-of-the-art benchmark heuristics, {ATB} allows an effective use of the time budget resulting in anticipatory decision making and high solution quality. Additionally, the {DLT} significantly strengthens and accelerates the approximation process.The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/trsc.2016.0719.},

We investigate its potential as a solution methodology for solving operational problems. Specifically, we explore its potential in the context of a dynamic variant of the vehicle routing problem with roaming delivery locations, in which customer itineraries may change during the execution of a planned delivery schedule, which, in turn, may cause the planned delivery schedule to become suboptimal or even infeasible. We propose an iterative solution framework in which an active delivery schedule is re-optimized whenever a customer itinerary update is revealed. We use a branch-and-price algorithm for solving the planning problem (to obtain an initial delivery schedule) as well as the re-optimization problems (to obtain modified delivery schedules). As the re-optimization problems are solved during the execution of the (active) delivery schedule, it is critical to produce solutions quickly. This is accomplished by re-using, suitably modified, columns generated during preceding branch-and-price solves. The results of our computational experiments demonstrate the viability of using branch-and-price for solving operational problems and the benefit (necessity) of re-using information from previous solves.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates a hypothesis that in case of hard optimization problems, selection of the proper search space is more relevant than the choice of the solving algorithm. Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem is used as a test problem and the hypothesis is verified experimentally on the well-known set of benchmark instances. The paper compares Particle Swarm Optimization ({PSO}) and Differential Evolution ({DE}) operating in two continuous search spaces (giving in total four distinctive approaches) and a state-of-the art discrete encoding utilizing Genetic Algorithm ({GA}). The advantage of selected continuous search space over a discrete one is verified on the basis of quality of the final solution and stability of intermediate partial solutions. During stability analysis it has been observed that practical level of uncertainty, resulting from the dynamic nature of the problem, is lower than could be expected from a popular degree of dynamism measure. In order to challenge that issue, benchmark problems have been solved also with a higher level of dynamism and an empirical degree of dynamism has been proposed as an additional measure of the amount of uncertainty of the problem. The results obtained by both continuous algorithms outperform those of state-of-the-art algorithms utilizing discrete problem representation, while the performance differences between them ({PSO} and {DE}) are minute. Apart from higher numerical efficiency in solving {DVRP}, the use of continuous problem encoding proved its advantage over discrete encoding also in terms of intermediate solutions stability. Requests-to-vehicles assignment sequences generated by the proposed approach were approximately 40\% more accurate with respect to the final solution than their counterparts generated with a discrete encoding. Analysis of these sequences of intermediate solutions for several benchmark sets resulted in designing a penalty term taking into account a specific dynamic nature of the optimized problem. An addition of this penalty term improved the above-mentioned stability of partial solutions by another 10\%.},

We incorporate temporal and spatial anticipation of service requests into approximate dynamic programming ({ADP}) procedures to yield dynamic routing policies for the single-vehicle routing problem with stochastic service requests, an important problem in city-based logistics. We contribute to the routing literature as well as to the field of {ADP}. We combine offline value function approximation ({VFA}) with online rollout algorithms resulting in a high-quality, computationally tractable policy. Our offline–online policy enhances the anticipation of the {VFA} policy, yielding spatial and temporal anticipation of requests and routing developments. Our combination of {VFA} with rollout algorithms demonstrates the potential benefit of using offline and online methods in tandem as a hybrid {ADP} procedure, making possible higher-quality policies with reduced computational requirements for real-time decision making. Finally, we identify a policy improvement guarantee applicable to {VFA}-based rollout algorithms, showing that base policies composed of deterministic decision rules lead to rollout policies with performance at least as strong as that of their base policy.},

	abstract = {Taxi services are a vital part of urban transportation, and a considerable contributor to traffic congestion and air pollution causing substantial adverse effects on human health. Sharing taxi trips is a possible way of reducing the negative impact of taxi services on cities, but this comes at the expense of passenger discomfort quantifiable in terms of a longer travel time. Due to computational challenges, taxi sharing has traditionally been approached on small scales, such as within airport perimeters, or with dynamical ad-hoc heuristics. However, a mathematical framework for the systematic understanding of the tradeoff between collective benefits of sharing and individual passenger discomfort is lacking. Here we introduce the notion of shareability network which allows us to model the collective benefits of sharing as a function of passenger inconvenience, and to efficiently compute optimal sharing strategies on massive datasets. We apply this framework to a dataset of millions of taxi trips taken in New York City, showing that with increasing but still relatively low passenger discomfort, cumulative trip length can be cut by 40\% or more. This benefit comes with reductions in service cost, emissions, and with split fares, hinting towards a wide passenger acceptance of such a shared service. Simulation of a realistic online system demonstrates the feasibility of a shareable taxi service in New York City. Shareability as a function of trip density saturates fast, suggesting effectiveness of the taxi sharing system also in cities with much sparser taxi fleets or when willingness to share is low.},

We formulate this as a dynamic program ({DP}) and compare it to static counterparts to demonstrate the advantage of the dynamic paradigm over an a priori approach. We then apply approximate linear programming ({ALP}) to overcome the {DP}'s curse of dimensionality, obtain a semi-infinite linear programming lower bound, and discuss its tractability. We also analyze a rollout version of the price-directed policy implied by our {ALP} and derive worst-case guarantees for its performance. Our computational study demonstrates the quality of a heuristically modified rollout policy using a computationally effective a posteriori bound.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider same-day delivery with a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles and drones. Customers make delivery requests over the course of the day and the dispatcher dynamically dispatches vehicles and drones to deliver the goods to customers before their delivery deadline. Vehicles can deliver multiple packages in one route but travel relatively slowly due to the urban traffic. Drones travel faster, but they have limited capacity and require charging or battery swaps. To exploit the different strengths of the fleets, we propose a deep Q-learning approach. Our method learns the value of assigning a new customer to either drones or vehicles as well as the option to not offer service at all. To aid feature selection, we present an analytical analysis that demonstrates the role that different types of information have on the value function and decision making. In a systematic computational analysis, we show the superiority of our policy compared to benchmark policies and the effectiveness of our deep Q-learning approach.},

In the field of dynamic routing, capturing the joint evolution of complex sequential routing decisions and stochastic information is challenging, leading to a situation where rigorous methods have outpaced rigorous models and thus making it difficult for researchers to engage in rigorous science. We provide a modeling framework that strongly connects application with method and that leverages the rich body of route-based planning and optimization. As a generalization of conventional Markov decision processes ({MDPs}), route-based {MDPs} augment the state space, action space, and reward structure to include routing information. Accordingly, route-based {MDPs} make it conceptually easier to connect dynamic routing problems with the route-based methods typically used to solve them – construct and revise routes as new information is learned. We anticipate route-based {MDPs} will facilitate more scientific rigor in dynamic routing studies, provide researchers with a common modeling language, allow for better inquiry, and improve classification and description of solution methods.},

When consumers can buy online and pick up their purchased goods at a store, the stores are often visited by a vehicle that supplies the pick-up points ({PUPs}) and by a vehicle that replenishes the store’s inventory. We study the benefit of exploiting any spare capacity in the vehicles replenishing store inventories to reduce online order fulfillment cost by transferring online orders to these vehicles at one or more of the stores visited. This involves choosing transfer locations and the set of stores whose online orders are transferred at these locations so as to minimize the online order fulfillment cost. We present a mixed integer linear programming model as well as an effective and efficient heuristic for solving this problem. An extensive computational study shows that significant benefits can be achieved by sharing capacity across the two channels.},

However, mobile technology creates new opportunities to organize the last mile. In this paper, we study the concept of crowdsourced delivery that aims to use excess capacity on journeys that already take place. We consider a service platform that automatically creates matches between parcel delivery tasks and ad hoc drivers. The platform also operates a fleet of dedicated vehicles to serve the tasks that cannot be served by the ad hoc drivers. The matching of tasks, drivers, and dedicated vehicles in real time gives rise to a new variant of the dynamic pickup and delivery problem. We propose a rolling horizon framework and develop an exact solution approach to solve the matching problem each time new information becomes available. To investigate the potential benefit of crowdsourced delivery, we conduct a wide range of computational experiments. The experiments provide insights into the viability of crowdsourced delivery under various assumptions about the behavior of the ad hoc drivers. The results suggest that the use of ad hoc drivers has the potential to make the last mile more cost-efficient and can provide system-wide vehicle-mile savings up to 37\% compared to a traditional delivery system with dedicated vehicles.The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/trsc.2017.0803.},

The operation of such a servicerequires to dynamically manage new requests, coordinate a fleet of shoppers, schedule shoppingoperations at stores, and execute deliveries to customers on time.Our work presents three operational strategies, each requiring different levels of shopperflexibility and implementation complexity. We quantify the performance of each strategy in avast family of computational experiments. Also, the performance of this on-demand shoppingservice is compared to a setting in which customers travel to stores to shop themselves. Ournumerical experiments show that there are significant savings in resources spent in shopping (upto 55.2\%) when this activity is outsourced.},

We design and implement an algorithm that optimally matches drivers and riders in large-scale ride-sharing systems with meeting points.

	abstract = {Stochastic and dynamic vehicle routing problems gain increasing attention in the research community. In these problems, routing plans are dynamically updated based on realizations of stochastic information. Due to the complexity of the corresponding Markov decision processes ({MDPs}), the calculation of optimal policies for these problems is usually not possible and researchers draw on heuristical methods of approximate dynamic programming ({ADP}). These methods use simulation to approximate the value of a state and decision in the {MDP}. The simulations are either conducted offline or online. Offline methods such as value function approximations ({VFAs}) generally neglect the full detail of the state space due to aggregation. Online methods such as rollout algorithms ({RAs}) are often not able to capture decision and transition space sufficiently due to runtime limitations. In this paper, we alleviate this tradeoff by combining two methods of {ADP}, an online {RA} and an offline {VFA} in two ways. In addition to the integration of the {VFA} as a base policy into the online {RA} to strengthen the {RA}’s simulations, we also limit the {RA}’s simulation horizon, estimating the remaining reward-to-go again via the {VFA}. For two stochastic dynamic routing problems from the literature, we show how this combination outperforms state-of-the-art solutions while simultaneously reducing the required time for online calculations.},

Furthermore, for both the event- and time-triggered assignments, we propose several algorithms to investigate how to distribute the newly generated target locations to the vehicles.

	abstract = {An increasing number of e-commerce retailers offers same-day delivery. To deliver the ordered goods, providers dynamically dispatch a fleet of vehicles transporting the goods from the warehouse to the customers. In many cases, retailers offer different delivery deadline options, from four-hour delivery up to next-hour delivery. Due to the deadlines, vehicles often only deliver a few orders per trip. The overall number of served orders within the delivery horizon is small and the revenue low. As a result, many companies currently struggle to conduct same-day delivery cost-efficiently. In this paper, we show how dynamic pricing is able to substantially increase both revenue and the number of customers we are able to serve the same day. To this end, we present an anticipatory pricing and routing policy ({APRP}) method that incentivizes customers to select delivery deadline options efficiently for the fleet to fulfill. This maintains the fleet’s flexibility to serve more future orders. We model the respective pricing and routing problem as a Markov decision process ({MDP}). To apply {APRP}, the state-dependent opportunity costs per customer and option are required. To this end, we use a guided offline value function approximation ({VFA}) based on state space aggregation. The {VFA} approximates the opportunity cost for every state and delivery option with respect to the fleet’s flexibility. As an offline method, {APRP} is able to determine suitable prices instantly when a customer orders. In an extensive computational study, we compare {APRP} with a policy based on fixed prices and with conventional temporal and geographical pricing policies. {APRP} outperforms the benchmark policies significantly, leading to both a higher revenue and more customers served the same day.},

	abstract = {Operations research requires models that unambiguously define problems and support the generation and presentation of solution methodology. In the field of dynamic routing, capturing the joint evolution of complex sequential routing decisions and stochastic information is challenging, leading to a situation where rigorous methods have outpaced rigorous models and thus making it difficult for researchers to engage in rigorous science. We provide a modeling framework that strongly connects application with method and that leverages the rich body of route-based planning and optimization. As a generalization of conventional Markov decision processes ({MDPs}), route-based {MDPs} augment the state space, action space, and reward structure to include routing information. Accordingly, route-based {MDPs} make it conceptually easier to connect dynamic routing problems with the route-based methods typically used to solve them – construct and revise routes as new information is learned. We anticipate route-based {MDPs} will facilitate more scientific rigor in dynamic routing studies, provide researchers with a common modeling language, allow for better inquiry, and improve classification and description of solution methods.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present provably-good algorithms for multi-robot task assignment, where each task has to be completed within its deadline. Each robot has a upper limit on the maximum number of tasks that it can perform due to its limited battery life, and each task takes the same amount of time to complete. Each robot has a different payoff (or cost) for the tasks and the objective is to assign the tasks to the robots such that the total payoff (cost) is maximized (minimized) while respecting the task deadline constraints. This problem is an extension of a special generalized assignment problem (where each task consumes the same time resource and must be finished), with additional deadline constraints for the time resource assignment. We show that the problem can be reduced to a problem of assigning tasks to robots, where the tasks are organized in overlapping sets, and each robot has a limit on the number of tasks it can perform from each set, which is a variant of multi-robot assignment problem with set precedence constraint ({SPC}-{MAP}) discussed in [1].We present a distributed auction-based algorithm for this problem and prove that the solution is almost-optimal. We also present simulation results to depict the performance of our algorithm.},

This study investigates how consumers value these delivery attributes (e.g., delivery speed, time slot, daytime/evening delivery, delivery date, and delivery fee) when selecting a delivery option for their online purchases. Mental accounting theory is used to frame the research and to suggest how mental accounts for money, time, and convenience influence consumer preferences for online delivery options. Specifically, the results of a conjoint analysis show that the most important attribute in shaping consumer preferences is the delivery fee, followed by nonprice delivery attributes. For individual attributes, significant differences are found in consumer preferences between gender and income groups. Cluster analysis reveals three consumer segments that show distinct preference structures: We identify a “price-oriented,” a “time- and convenience-oriented,” and a “value-for-money-oriented” consumer segment. This study has practical implications for online retailers when implementing suitable delivery strategies and designing effective delivery options to maximize consumer satisfaction.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to derive monetary benchmarks and managerial implications for omni-channel retailers’ B2C e-fulfillment strategies by investigating the trade-offs between lead time, delivery convenience and total price including shipment in the context of online electronics retailing. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a choice-based conjoint analysis among 550 {US} online shoppers, the monetary values of lead time and convenience were calculated in a log-log regression model. In addition, latent class segmentation was applied to identify consumer segments according to their differing e-fulfillment preferences. Findings: From a consumer perspective, the analysis suggests that price is the most important criteria in omni-channel retailer selection, followed by lead time and convenience. The value of time is, on average, \$3.61 per day. Regarding convenience, the results indicate that delivery to the home is highly preferred over pick-up options. The value of the consumer’s travel time was estimated at \$10.62 per hour. The latent class segmentation identified four segment groups with different preferences. Research limitations/implications: To validate the findings, future research could analyze real data from omni-channel retailers’ customers’ buying behavior. It should also be interesting to extend the research to other price ranges, market segments and e-fulfillment factors, such as return options, shop ratings and membership programs aiming for further generalization. Practical implications: The findings guide omni-channel retailers to focus on efficient B2C e-fulfillment strategies. Considerable competitive advantages may be gained by reducing lead times and offering convenient delivery in line with the lead time valuation of the identified customer segment. Originality/value: This study fills gaps in the academic research of consumer behavior in retailer selection, which has primarily concentrated on the choice between “brick-and-mortar” and online sales channels. It paves the way for a more service-oriented perspective in omni-channel retailing research.},

	abstract = {The demand for same-day delivery ({SDD}) has increased rapidly in the last few years and has particularly boomed during the {COVID}-19 pandemic. Existing literature on the problem has focused on maximizing the utility, represented as the total number of expected requests served. However, a utility-driven solution results in unequal opportunities for customers to receive delivery service, raising questions about fairness. In this paper, we study the problem of achieving fairness in {SDD}. We construct a regional-level fairness constraint that ensures customers from different regions have an equal chance of being served. We develop a reinforcement learning model to learn policies that focus on both overall utility and fairness. Experimental results demonstrate the ability of our approach to mitigate the unfairness caused by geographic differences and constraints of resources, at both coarser and finer-grained level and with a small cost to utility. In addition, we simulate a real-world situation where the system is suddenly overwhelmed by a surge of requests, mimicking the {COVID}-19 scenario. Our model is robust to the systematic pressure and is able to maintain fairness with little compromise to the utility.},

We propose a new multicommodity flow model for line planning. Its main features, in comparison to existing models, are that the passenger paths can be freely routed and lines are generated dynamically. We discuss properties of this model, investigate its complexity, and present a column-generation algorithm for its solution.

Unlike what happens in classical multi-depot {VRP}, not every customer may/will be served by all the vehicles or from all the depots. The planning horizon, as in most real life applications, consists of multiple periods, and the period in which each route is performed is a variable of the problem. The set of periods, within the time horizon, in which the delivery may be carried out is known for each customer. A Mixed Integer Programming ({MIP}) formulation for {MDMPVRPHF} is presented in this paper, and an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search ({ALNS}) based Matheuristic approach is proposed, in which different destroy operators are defined.

	abstract = {Same-day delivery of online orders is becoming an indispensable service for large retailers. We explore an environment in which in-store customers supplement company drivers and deliver online orders on their way home. We consider a highly dynamic and stochastic same-day delivery environment in which online orders as well as in-store customers willing to make deliveries arrive throughout the day. Studying settings in which delivery capacity is uncertain is novel and practically relevant. Our proposed approaches are simple, yet produce high-quality solutions in a short amount of time that can be employed in practice. We develop two rolling horizon dispatching approaches: a myopic one that considers only the state of the system when making decisions, and one that also incorporates probabilistic information about future online order and in-store customer arrivals. We quantify the potential benefits of a novel form of crowdshipping for same-day delivery and demonstrate the value of exploiting probabilistic information about the future. We explore the advantages and disadvantages of this form of crowdshipping and show the impact of changes in environment characteristics, for example, online order arrival pattern, company fleet size, and in-store customer compensation on its performance, that is, service quality and operational cost.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10676},
	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel, computational eﬃcient, dynamic ridesharing algorithm. The beneﬁcial computational properties of the algorithm arise from casting the ridesharing problem as a linear assignment problem between ﬂeet vehicles and customer trip requests within a federated optimization architecture. The resulting algorithm is up to four times faster than the state-of-the-art, even if it is implemented on a less dedicated hardware, and achieves similar service quality. Current literature showcases the ability of state-ofthe-art ridesharing algorithms to tackle very large ﬂeets and customer requests in almost near real-time, but the beneﬁts of ridesharing seem limited to centralized systems. Our algorithm suggests that this does not need to be the case. The algorithm that we propose is fully distributable among multiple ridesharing companies. By leveraging two datasets, the New York city taxi dataset and the Melbourne Metropolitan Area dataset, we show that with our algorithm, real-time ridesharing oﬀers clear beneﬁts with respect to more traditional taxi ﬂeets in terms of level of service, even if one considers partial adoption of the system. In fact, e.g., the quality of the solutions obtained in the state-of-the-art works that tackle the whole customer set of the New York city taxi dataset is achieved, even if one considers only a proportion of the ﬂeet size and customer requests. This could make real-time urban-scale ridesharing very attractive to small enterprises and city authorities alike. However, in some cases, e.g., in multi-company scenarios where companies have predeﬁned market shares, we show that the number of vehicles needed to achieve a comparable performance to the monopolistic setting increases, and this raises concerns on the possible negative eﬀects of multi-company ridesharing.},

In this approach, we train a single model that ﬁnds near-optimal solutions for problem instances sampled from a given distribution, only by observing the reward signals and following feasibility rules. Our model represents a parameterized stochastic policy, and by applying a policy gradient algorithm to optimize its parameters, the trained model produces the solution as a sequence of consecutive actions in real time, without the need to re-train for every new problem instance. On capacitated {VRP}, our approach outperforms classical heuristics and Google’s {OR}-Tools on medium-sized instances in solution quality with comparable computation time (after training). We demonstrate how our approach can handle problems with split delivery and explore the effect of such deliveries on the solution quality. Our proposed framework can be applied to other variants of the {VRP} such as the stochastic {VRP}, and has the potential to be applied more generally to combinatorial optimization problems.},

Each layer of the hierarchy is designed with a separate reward function, resulting in stable training. Our results demonstrate that {GPNs} trained on small-scale {TSP}50/100 problems generalize well to larger-scale {TSP}500/1000 problems, with shorter tour lengths and faster computational times. We verify that for constrained {TSP} problems such as the {TSP} with time windows, the feasible solutions found via hierarchical {RL} training outperform previous baselines.

Nevertheless, due to the long detours required by a door-to-door scheme, they induce extra costs to the users in terms of delay. In this paper, we face the design of such a system in which users might be requested online to walk towards/from nearby pick-up/drop-off points if this improves overall efficiency. We show theoretically that the general problem becomes more complex (as it contains two sub-problems that extend set-cover), analyze the trade-offs that emerge, and provide a general formulation and specific heuristics that are able to solve it over large instances. We test this formulation over a real dataset of Manhattan taxi trips (9970 requests during one hour), finding that (a) average walks of about one minute can reduce the number of rejections in more than 80\% and Vehicles-Hour-Traveled in more than 10\%, (b) users who depart or arrive at the most demanded areas are more likely to be required to walk, and (c) the performance improvement of the service is larger when the system receives more trip requests.},

	volume = {8},
	abstract = {In this paper, we explore same-day delivery routing and particularly how same-day delivery vehicles can better integrate dynamic requests into delivery routes by taking advantage of preemptive depot returns. A preemptive depot return occurs when a delivery vehicle returns to the depot before delivering all of the packages currently on-board the vehicle. In this paper, we assume that a vehicle serves requests in a particular delivery area. Beginning the day with some known deliveries, the vehicle seeks to serve the known requests as well as additional new requests that are received throughout the day. To serve the new requests, the vehicle must return to the depot to pick up the packages for delivery. In contrast to previous work on same-day delivery routing, in this paper, we allow the vehicle to return to the depot before serving all loaded packages. To solve the problem, we couple an approximation of the value of choosing any particular subset of requests for delivery with a routing heuristic. Our approximation procedure is based on approximate dynamic programming and allows us to capture both the current value of a subset selection decision and its impact on future rewards. Using extensive computational tests, we demonstrate the value of preemptive depot returns and the value of the proposed approximation scheme in supporting preemptive returns. We also identify characteristics of instances for which preemptive depot returns are most likely to offer improvement.},

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 {BLEU} on the {WMT} 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 {BLEU}. On the {WMT} 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art {BLEU} score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight {GPUs}, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.

It was not previously known whether, in practice, such overestimations are common, whether they harm performance, and whether they can generally be prevented. In this paper, we answer all these questions affirmatively. In particular, we first show that the recent {DQN} algorithm, which combines Q-learning with a deep neural network, suffers from substantial overestimations in some games in the Atari 2600 domain. We then show that the idea behind the Double Q-learning algorithm, which was introduced in a tabular setting, can be generalized to work with large-scale function approximation. We propose a specific adaptation to the {DQN} algorithm and show that the resulting algorithm not only reduces the observed overestimations, as hypothesized, but that this also leads to much better performance on several games.},

	abstract = {Model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, such as Q-learning, perform poorly in the early stages of learning in noisy environments, because much effort is spent unlearning biased estimates of the state-action value function. The bias results from selecting, among several noisy estimates, the apparent optimum, which may actually be suboptimal. We propose G-learning, a new off-policy learning algorithm that regularizes the value estimates by penalizing deterministic policies in the beginning of the learning process. We show that this method reduces the bias of the value-function estimation, leading to faster convergence to the optimal value and the optimal policy. Moreover, G-learning enables the natural incorporation of prior domain knowledge, when available. The stochastic nature of G-learning also makes it avoid some exploration costs, a property usually attributed only to on-policy algorithms. We illustrate these ideas in several examples, where G-learning results in significant improvements of the convergence rate and the cost of the learning process.},

One of the most challenging problems of {MRS} is how to optimally assign a set of robots to a set of tasks in such a way that optimizes the overall system performance subject to a set of constraints. This problem is known as Multi-robot Task Allocation ({MRTA}) problem. {MRTA} is a complex problem especially when it comes to heterogeneous unreliable robots equipped with different capabilities that are required to perform various tasks with different requirements and constraints in an optimal way.

abstract = {In this paper, we present a state-of-the-art survey on the vehicle routing problem with multiple depots (MDVRP). Our review considered papers published between 1988 and 2014, in which several variants of the model are studied: time windows, split delivery, heterogeneous fleet, periodic deliveries, and pickup and delivery. The review also classifies the approaches according to the single or multiple objectives that are optimized. Some lines for further research are presented as well.}

abstract = {Vehicle routing problems, among the most studied in combinatorial optimization, arise in many practical contexts (freight distribution and collection, transportation, garbage collection, newspaper delivery, etc.). Operations researchers have made significant developments in the algorithms for their solution, and Vehicle Routing: Problems, Methods, and Applications, Second Edition reflects these advances. The text of the new edition is either completely new or significantly revised and provides extensive and complete state-of-the-art coverage of vehicle routing by those who have done most of the innovative research in the area; it emphasizes methodology related to specific classes of vehicle routing problems and, since vehicle routing is used as a benchmark for all new solution techniques, contains a complete overview of current solutions to combinatorial optimization problems. It also includes several chapters on important and emerging applications, such as disaster relief and green vehicle routing. Audience: This book is intended for both researchers and graduate level students in operations research and applied mathematics. Practitioners will find this book particularly useful. Readers need a basic knowledge of the main methods for the solution of combinatorial optimization problems.}

\noindent \textbf{Dexterous Manipulation} Dexterous manipulation has been a long-standing problem in robotics~\cite{rus1999hand, dex_overview, sliding_dex, rolling_dex, pivot_dex, dex_1, dex_2, dex_3, dex_4, dex_5, dex_6, dex_7, dex_8, rl-openai}. Among these works, dexterous in-hand manipulation receives a lot of attention in recent years~\cite{dexhand_1_kumar2014real_time_behaviour_synthesis, dexhand_2_Bhatt2021surprisingly, dexhand_3_bai2014dexterous, dexhand_4_morgan2022complex, rl-openai}. Several early methods propose to tackle the in-hand manipulation problem with analytical model-based approaches~\cite{dexhand_1_kumar2014real_time_behaviour_synthesis, dexhand_3_bai2014dexterous}. Nevertheless, they pose certain hypotheses about the objects and the controllers, which makes it hard to scale to more complex tasks. To overcome this limitation, deep Reinforcement Learning has been applied recently on dexterous manipulation~\cite{rl-openai, dextreme, corl21-inhand, qin2022dexpoint, chen2022visual, qi2022hand}. Building on these works, incorporating human demonstrations in with imitation learning also leads to better sample efficiency and  more natural manipulation behaviors~\cite{qin2022dexmv, dapg, arunachalam2022dexterous, qin2022one, ye2022learning, liu2022herd, patel2022learning, arunachalam2022holo}. However, most in-hand manipulation methods are still highly relying on visual inputs~\cite{rl-openai,dextreme,chen2022visual}. For example, Chen et al.~\cite{chen2022visual} propose to perform in-hand object re-orientation  using depth image input, and new hardware is designed to avoid heavy occlusion. Instead of relying on vision which faces the occlusion problem with general hardware, recently, Qi et al.~\cite{qi2022hand} propose to perform in-hand object rotation without both visual and tactile sensing. However, this work only considers object rotation on the 4 fingertips with a relatively small finger motion. Their setup limits the size and shape of the objects to manipulate, and the diversity of the tasks. Compared to this work, we perform object orientation on the palm of the hand using large finger motion, which is more challenging, but has the potential to generalize to more tasks in principle. Using touch, our policy can manipulate diverse unseen objects. 
 


\noindent \textbf{Tactile Robotic Manipulation} Biological evidence suggests that tactile information is crucial for the success of human dexterity~\cite{human_tactile}. This basic observation naturally motivates the research of tactile robotic manipulation~\cite{6943031, molchanov2016contact, tactile_insertion, bhattacharjee2015material, navarro2015active, zhu2022learning, roller_tactile2022, suresh2022midastouch, tactile_slam, tandem, object_track2022patchgraph, visiotactile, manipulation_by_feel, smith2021active, tactile2020alberto, roller_tactile2022, murali2020learning, taylor2022gelslim,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1907.13098,gao2022objectfolder}. A fundamental question is what kind of touch information is essential. Existing works propose to extract local geometry, force and torque, contact event, and material properties with various sensors to help manipulation~\cite{tactile2020review}. Different from these works, we find that even using the simplest binary contact signal provided by a sparse sensor array can be helpful for a high-dimensional manipulator. This is also found in~\cite{bin_contact_1, bin_contact_2} where binary contact signals are used for manipulation and exploring objects. However, they focus on low-DOF manipulators rather than a multi-finger robot hand. In the dexterous hand research, Buescher et al.~\cite{tactile_skin} develop a skin-based tactile sensing system on the Shadow hand, which has a similar but denser sensor layout over the palm compared with our work. However, it is still unclear how to use it with a control method to solve  in-hand rotation as in our work. Another important question in tactile robotic manipulation is how to simulate the tactile event so as to perform Sim2Real transfer. Researchers have proposed many approaches and strategies for tactile simulation~\cite{moisio2013model,habib2014skinsim,tactile_sim,church2022tactile,si2022taxim,bi2021zero}. For example, Xu et al.~\cite{tactile_sim} propose a method to simulate normal and shear tactile force field on the contact surface. Compared with these works, our method does not require any extra simulation design but can leverage the built-in contact simulation of an existing physics simulator.

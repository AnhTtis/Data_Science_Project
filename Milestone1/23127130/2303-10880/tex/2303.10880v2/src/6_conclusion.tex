 \section{Conclusion}
 In this paper, we have presented a tactile manipulation system that is able to rotate different objects without vision. We showed an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework to learn tactile dexterity over the proposed system. We carried out experiments both in simulation and real to demonstrate its effectiveness. Our work demonstrated that we are able to achieve tactile dexterity as humans in real for the first time. In the future, there are many promising future directions to investigate, such as exploring the use of a more dense contact sensor array and scaling up the system to solve more diverse tasks. We hope that our work can pave the way for more intelligent robot hands.

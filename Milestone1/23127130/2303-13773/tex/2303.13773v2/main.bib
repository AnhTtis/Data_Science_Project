This question attracts a lot of interest, with recent works tackling computationally hard tasks such as the traveling salesman problem and satisfiability. In this work we offer a different perspective on this question. Given the common assumption that NP != coNP we prove that any polynomial-time sample generator for an NP-hard problem samples, in fact, from an easier sub-problem. We empirically explore a case study, Conjunctive Query Containment, and show how common data generation techniques generate biased data-sets that lead practitioners to over-estimate model accuracy. Our results suggest that machine learning approaches that require training on a dense uniform sampling from the target distribution cannot be used to solve computationally hard problems, the reason being the difficulty of generating sufficiently large and unbiased training sets.},

However, very few true industrial instances exist for most problems, which poses a problem both to algorithm designers and methods for algorithm selection. The lack of enough real data leads to an inability for algorithm designers to show the effectiveness of their techniques, and for algorithm selection it is difficult or even impossible to train a portfolio with so few training examples. This paper introduces a novel instance generator that creates instances that have the same structural properties as industrial instances. We generate instances through a large neighborhood search-like method that combines components of instances together to form new ones. We test our approach on the MaxSAT and SAT problems, and then demonstrate that portfolios trained on these generated instances perform just as well or even better than those trained on the real instances.},

This instance space shows the similarities and differences between the instances using measurable features or properties, and enables the performance of algorithms to be viewed across the instance space, where generalizations can be inferred. The power of this methodology is the insights that can be generated into algorithm strengths and weaknesses by examining the regions in instance space where strong performance can be expected. The representation of the instance space is dependent on the choice of test instances however. In this paper we present a methodology for generating new test instances with controllable properties, by filling observed gaps in the instance space.

Specifically, we first utilize graph neural networks to predict the marginal probability of each variable, and then search for the best feasible solution within a properly defined ball around the predicted solution.

While generally reliable, state-of-the-art MIP solvers base many crucial decisions on hand-crafted heuristics, largely ignoring common patterns within a given instance distribution of the problem of interest. Here, we propose MIP-GNN, a general framework for enhancing such solvers with data-driven insights. By encoding the variable-constraint interactions of a given mixed-integer linear program (MILP) as a bipartite graph, we leverage state-of-the-art graph neural network architectures to predict variable biases, i.e., component-wise averages of (near) optimal solutions, indicating how likely a variable will be set to 0 or 1 in (near) optimal solutions of binary MILPs. In turn, the predicted biases stemming from a single, once-trained model are used to guide the solver, replacing heuristic components. We integrate MIP-GNN into a state-of-the-art MIP solver, applying it to tasks such as node selection and warm-starting, showing significant improvements compared to the default setting of the solver on two classes of challenging binary MILPs.

	abstract = {The design of good heuristics or approximation algorithms for NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems often requires significant specialized knowledge and trial-and-error. Can we automate this challenging, tedious process, and learn the algorithms instead? In many real-world applications, it is typically the case that the same optimization problem is solved again and again on a regular basis, maintaining the same problem structure but differing in the data. This provides an opportunity for learning heuristic algorithms that exploit the structure of such recurring problems.  In this paper, we propose a unique combination of reinforcement learning and graph embedding to address this challenge. The learned greedy policy behaves like a meta-algorithm that incrementally constructs a solution, and the action is determined by the output of a graph embedding network capturing the current state of the solution. We show that our framework can be applied to a diverse range of optimization problems over graphs, and learns effective algorithms for the Minimum Vertex Cover, Maximum Cut and Traveling Salesman problems.},

Good solutions to this problem are collectively computed within an elapsed time of only a few neural time constants. The effectiveness of the computation involves both the nonlinear analog response of the neurons and the large connectivity among them. Dedicated networks of biological or microelectronic neurons could provide the computational capabilities described for a wide class of problems having combinatorial complexity.

If the detected structure reflects the (usually unknown) actual structure of the MIP well, the solver may be much faster on the reformulated model than on the original. Otherwise, the solver may completely fail. We propose a supervised learning approach to decide whether or not a reformulation should be applied, and which decomposition to choose when several are possible.

	abstract = {Emergency observations are missions executed by Earth observation satellites to support urgent ground operations. Emergency observations become more important for meeting the requirements of highly dynamic and highly time-sensitive observation missions, such as disaster monitoring and early warning. Considering the complex scheduling problem of Earth observation satellites under emergency conditions, a multi-satellite dynamic mission scheduling model based on mission priority is proposed in this paper. A calculation model of mission priority is designed for emergency missions based on seven impact factors. In the satellite mission scheduling, the resource constraints of scheduling are analyzed in detail, and the optimization objective function is built to maximize the observation mission priority and mission revenues, and minimize the waiting time for missions that require urgency for execution time. Then, the hybrid genetic tabu search algorithm is used to obtain the initial satellite scheduling plan. In case of the dynamic arrival of new emergency missions before scheduling plan releases, a dynamic scheduling algorithm based on mission priority is proposed to solve the scheduling problem caused by newly arrived missions and to obtain the scheduling plan of newly arrived missions. A simulation experiment was conducted for different numbers of initial missions and newly arrived missions, and the scheduling results were evaluated with a model performance evaluation function. The results show that the execution probability of high-priority missions increased because the mission priority was taken into account in the model. In the case of more satellite resources, when new missions dynamically arrived, the satellite resources can be reasonably allocated to these missions based on the mission priority. Overall, this approach reduces the complexity of the dynamic adjustment and maintains the stability of the initial scheduling plan.},

Considering the uncertainties of clouds, we formulate the cloud coverage for observations as stochastic events, and extend the assignment formulation to a chance constraint programming (CCP) model. To solve the problem, we suggest a sample approximation (SA) method, which transforms the CCP model into an integer linear programming (ILP) model. Subsequently, a branch and cut (B\&C) algorithm based on lazy constraint generation is developed to solve the ILP model.

	abstract = {In the past decade, considerable advances have been made in the field of computational intelligence and operations research. However, the majority of these optimisation approaches have been developed for deterministically formulated problems, the parameters of which are often assumed perfectly predictable prior to problem-solving. In practice, this strong assumption unfortunately contradicts the reality of many real-world problems which are subject to different levels of uncertainties. The solutions derived from these deterministic approaches can rapidly deteriorate during execution due to the over-optimisation without explicit consideration of the uncertainties. To address this research gap, a deep reinforcement learning based hyper-heuristic framework is proposed in this paper. The proposed approach enhances the existing hyper-heuristics with a powerful data-driven heuristic selection module in the form of deep reinforcement learning on parameter-controlled low-level heuristics, to substantially improve their handling of uncertainties while optimising across various problems. The performance and practicality of the proposed hyper-heuristic approach have been assessed on two combinatorial optimisation problems: a real-world container terminal truck routing problem with uncertain service times and the well-known online 2D strip packing problem. The experimental results demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing solution methods for these problems. Finally, the increased interpretability of the proposed deep reinforcement learning hyper-heuristic has been exhibited in comparison with the conventional deep reinforcement learning methods.},

	abstract = {Branching on a set of variables, rather than on a single variable, can give tighter bounds at the child nodes and can result in smaller search trees. However, selecting a good set of variables to branch on is even more challenging than selecting a good single variable to branch on. Generalized strong branching extends the strong branching concepts developed for choosing a single variable to choosing a set of variables. As the computational requirements of a full implementation of strong branching are prohibitive, we use extreme gradient boosting to train a model to predict the ranking of (sets of) candidate variables. An extensive computational study using instances from three well-known classes of optimization problems demonstrates that branching on sets of variables outperforms branching on a single variable, that a learned model can be used effectively to select among (sets of) candidate variables, and that the learned strong branching strategies outperform the default branching strategy of state-of-the-art commercial solver CPLEX in terms of both the number of nodes explored in the search tree and the time it takes to explore the search tree.},

This integration aims to lead meta-heuristics toward an efficient, effective, and robust search and improve their performance in terms of solution quality, convergence rate, and robustness. Since various integration methods with different purposes have been developed, there is a need to review the recent advances in using machine learning techniques to improve meta-heuristics. To the best of our knowledge, the literature is deprived of having a comprehensive yet technical review. To fill this gap, this paper provides such a review on the use of machine learning techniques in the design of different elements of meta-heuristics for different purposes including algorithm selection, fitness evaluation, initialization, evolution, parameter setting, and cooperation. First, we describe the key concepts and preliminaries of each of these ways of integration. Then, the recent advances in each way of integration are reviewed and classified based on a proposed unified taxonomy. Finally, we provide a technical discussion on the advantages, limitations, requirements, and challenges of implementing each of these integration ways, followed by promising future research directions.},

	abstract = {The branch-and-bound (B\&B) procedure is one of the most widely used techniques to get optimal solutions for the resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP). Recently, various components from the literature have been assembled by Coelho and Vanhoucke (2018) into a unified search algorithm using the best performing lower bounds, branching schemes, search strategies, and dominance rules. However, due to the high computational time, this procedure is only suitable to solve small to medium-sized problems. Moreover, despite its relatively good performance, not much is known about which components perform best, and how these components should be combined into a procedure to maximize chances to solve the problem. This paper introduces a structured prediction approach to rank various combinations of components (configurations) of the integrated B\&B procedure. More specifically, two regression methods are used to map project indicators to a full ranking of configurations. The objective is to provide preference information about the quality of different configurations to obtain the best possible solution. Using such models, the ranking of all configurations can be predicted, and these predictions are then used to get the best possible solution for a new project with known network and resource values. A computational experiment is conducted to verify the performance of this novel approach. Furthermore, the models are tested for 48 different configurations, and their robustness is investigated on datasets with different numbers of activities. The results show that the two models are very competitive, and both can generate significantly better results than any single-best configuration.},

For selecting cuts, modern solvers rely on manually designed heuristics that are tuned to gauge the potential effectiveness of cuts. We show that a greedy selection rule explicitly looking ahead to select cuts that yield the best bound improvement delivers strong decisions for cut selection – but is too expensive to be deployed in practice. In response, we propose a new neural architecture (NeuralCut) for imitation learning on the lookahead expert. Our model outperforms standard baselines for cut selection on several synthetic MILP benchmarks. Experiments on a realistic B\&C solver further validate our approach, and exhibit the potential of learning methods in this setting.},

In this paper, we survey the trend of leveraging ML to solve the mixed-integer programming problem (MIP). Theoretically, MIP is an NP-hard problem, and most CO problems can be formulated as MIP. Like other CO problems, the human-designed heuristic algorithms for MIP rely on good initial solutions and cost a lot of computational resources. Therefore, researchers consider applying machine learning methods to solve MIP since ML-enhanced approaches can provide the solution based on the typical patterns from the training data. Specifically, we first introduce the formulation and preliminaries of MIP and representative traditional solvers. Then, we show the integration of machine learning and MIP with detailed discussions on related learning-based methods, which can be further classified into exact and heuristic algorithms. Finally, we propose the outlook for learning-based MIP solvers, the direction toward more combinatorial optimization problems beyond MIP, and the mutual embrace of traditional solvers and ML components.

	abstract = {This paper presents an indicator-based multi-objective local search (IBMOLS) to solve a multi-objective optimization problem. The problem concerns the selection and scheduling of observations for an agile Earth observing satellite. The mission of an Earth observing satellite is to obtain photographs of the Earth surface to satisfy user requirements. Requests from several users have to be managed before transmitting an order, which is a sequence of selected acquisitions, to the satellite. The obtained sequence has to optimize two objectives under operation constraints. The objectives are to maximize the total profit of the selected acquisitions and simultaneously to ensure the fairness of resource sharing by minimizing the maximum profit difference between users. Experiments are conducted on realistic instances. Hypervolumes of the approximate Pareto fronts are computed and the results from IBMOLS are compared with the results from the biased random-key genetic algorithm (BRKGA).},

KOMPSAT-2 has the mission goal of maximizing image acquisition in time and quality requested by customers and operates under several complicating conditions. One of the characteristics in KOMPSAT-2 is its strip mode operation, in which segments of continuous-observation areas with known sizes are captured one at a time. In this paper, we regard the segment as a group of adjoining geographical square regions (scenes), whose size must also be determined. Thus, the problem involves the determination of proper segment lengths as well as an image collection schedule. We present a binary integer programming model for this problem in a multi-orbit long-term planning environment and provide a heuristic solution approach based on the Lagrangian relaxation and subgradient methods. We also present the results of our computational experiment based on randomly generated data.},

The problem has a significant economic importance due to its high initial investment cost that exists in these instruments and its solution difficulty resulting from the large solution space, making it an attractive research area. This article proposes a genetic algorithm (GA) for solving the SPOT5 selection problem using a new genome representation for maximizing not only a single objective as profit but a multi-criteria objective that includes the number of acquired photographs. Test results of our proposed GA show that it finds optimal solutions effectively for moderate size problems and obtains better results for two large benchmark instances coded 1403 and 1504 in the literature. Also, we verify the result that the best known value in the literature for problem coded 1401 is an optimal value. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {We present novel two-stage dynamic scheduling of earth observation satellites to provide emergency response by making full use of the duration of the imaging task execution. In the first stage, the multiobjective genetic algorithm NSGA-II is used to produce an optimal satellite imaging schedule schema, which is robust to dynamic adjustment as possible emergent events occur in the future. In the second stage, when certain emergent events do occur, a dynamic adjusting heuristic algorithm (CTM-DAHA) is applied to arrange new tasks into the robust imaging schedule. Different from the existing dynamic scheduling methods, the imaging duration is embedded in the two stages to make full use of current satellite resources. In the stage of robust satellite scheduling, total task execution time is used as a robust indicator to obtain a satellite schedule with less imaging time. In other words, more imaging time is preserved for future emergent events. In the stage of dynamic adjustment, a compact task merging strategy is applied to combine both of existing tasks and emergency tasks into a composite task with least imaging time. Simulated experiments indicate that the proposed method can produce a more robust and effective satellite imaging schedule.},

	abstract = {Modelling, simulating and testing the on-orbit thermal behaviour of a pico-satellite before launch is critical to ensure component reliability and performance. Due to small thermal inertia and hence small time constant, a pico-satellite may undergo larger temperature swings than those experienced by larger satellites. Weight, size and power limitations are especially restrictive in pico-satellites and limit thermal control to passive systems such as controlling conduction and radiation heat transfer paths. A lumped parameter thermal model was developed to study the on-orbit thermal response of the UoMBSat-1 PocketQube, Malta’s first pico-satellite project. A numerical finite element model is presented in order to test and validate the thermal model and passive thermal control. Small satellites are usually launched on rockets as piggyback satellites; therefore, orbit parameters are rarely known in the early stages of the project and various launch opportunities would need to be evaluated and compared. This paper presents a parametric analysis where the effects of orbit parameters, such as altitude and beta angle, on the thermal response are evaluated. We show that by controlling the surface finish and beta angle, it is possible to place a pico-satellite in a thermal regime that is suitable for typical electronic components, and batteries.},

	abstract = {A comprehensive but simple formulation for the attitude of a nanosatellite is presented herein with a focus on problems associated with spin and heat transfer. Sequential matrices of rotation predict the position and orientation of the spacecraft, which govern the heat fluxes composed of solar, albedo and infrared radiation. These fluxes are boundary conditions for the energy equation and are implemented to solve the temperature field based on the finite volume method. Common spins are used as benchmark cases to study their effect on the temperature of CubeSats. The attitude of nadir, detumbling, high speed, arbitrary motion and maximum exposure to the Sun are simulated for orbits with and without eclipse, at an altitude of 650 km and inclination of 90°. Results for total heat influx and temperature of the external surfaces are shown for single full orbits. Low spins are associated with the largest temperature gradients, due to the unequal distribution of heat fluxes. High angular speed homogenizes the temperature, especially for a spin around three axes. In general, for high spin, temperatures are nearly constant and appropriate for regular operational temperatures. Data collect from CubeSats in orbit are compared with the numerical values and satisfactory agreement is observed, despite differences in the designs and geometries. The model presented is comprised of a formulation for the spin and for the thermal irradiation over a CubeSat and can be implemented in traditional programming languages to investigate different orbital parameters for CubeSats and Picosats.},

	abstract = {The number of tasks that a satellite may execute in orbit is strongly related to the amount of energy its Electrical Power System (EPS) is able to harvest and to store. The manner the stored energy is distributed within the satellite has also a great impact on the CubeSat's overall efficiency. Most CubeSat's EPS do not prioritize energy constraints in their formulation. Unlike that, this work proposes an innovative energy-driven scheduling algorithm based on energy harvesting maximization policy. The energy harvesting circuit is mathematically modeled and the solar panel I-V curves are presented for different temperature and irradiance levels. Considering the models and simulations, the scheduling algorithm is designed to keep solar panels working close to their maximum power point by triggering tasks in the appropriate form. Tasks execution affects battery voltage, which is coupled to the solar panels through a protection circuit. A software based Perturb and Observe strategy allows defining the tasks to be triggered. The scheduling algorithm is tested in FloripaSat, which is an 1U CubeSat. A test apparatus is proposed to emulate solar irradiance variation, considering the satellite movement around the Earth. Tests have been conducted to show that the scheduling algorithm improves the CubeSat energy harvesting capability by 4.48\% in a three orbit experiment and up to 8.46\% in a single orbit cycle in comparison with the CubeSat operating without the scheduling algorithm.},

First, main mission parameters and the spacecraft design are presented, in order to fix the boundary conditions and the thermal environment used for the analysis. Then, the thermal model built to solve the thermal balance problem is described into details, and the numerical simulation code is presented. Finally, results are given and discussed in depth. The tool developed provides excellent modelling capabilities and temperature distributions have been validated through commercial software. The analysis has been used to refine the spacecraft configuration and to set the requirements applicable to the thermal control system of the satellite. The results showed that a basically passive control is sufficient to maintain most spacecraft׳s components within their temperature range when appropriate thermal coatings and/or tapes are provided. However, heaters to warm up batteries are recommended to survive coldest conditions.},

With the rapid growth of renewable generations, the grid uncertainties have greatly increased, which cannot be ignored in the decision-making of optimal transmission switching problems. This paper proposes a novel two-stage stochastic optimization formulation with a convex relaxation for AC optimal transmission switching problems. A generalized Benders decomposition based algorithm, including an inner loop and an outer loop, is proposed to solve the AC optimal transmission switching problem with grid uncertainties. The optimal switching plan and the expected system cost will be found in the iterative calculation without any sacrifice of accuracy. Numerical studies on the IEEE 118-bus system and the South Carolina 500-bus confirm the effectiveness of the proposed decomposition approach in solving the AC optimal transmission switching problems with grid uncertainties. The scalability analysis shows the proposed approach is efficient in dealing with a large number of scenarios.},

In particular, the task scheduling problem for nanosatellites has been the focus of recent research, given the unique set of constraints and applications, and considering their limited power resources. This paper applies the continuous-time methodology to deliver a novel scheduling formulation for the nanosatellite scheduling problem with increased flexibility and versatility to the decision-maker. Here, we adopt the concept of priority slots and follow the Multi-Operation Sequencing with Synchronized Start Times (MOS-SST) representation to yield a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation that considers constraints on time synchronization, mission quality-of-service, and management of shared resources. By comparing our continuous-time strategy with existing discrete-time alternatives, we showed that the proposed method can solve representative problem instances in a considerably shorter time, while being able to deal with real-valued constraint functions.},

	abstract = {Renewable energy and modernization of power operation demand Independent System Operators (ISOs) to solve ever more complex and larger programming problems to securely and economically schedule power resources. A key step in the scheduling process is the unit commitment (UC). In a hydro-dominated system, this process also involves managing reservoirs and is called hydrothermal UC (HTUC). Due to its size, non-convex nature and strict solution-time requirements, HTUC remains a challenging problem to ISOs even in its deterministic form. Relying on a commercial solver to directly tackle this problem might require a careful configuration of the solver’s parameters, and, given the generality of commercial solvers, it might not fully exploit all characteristics of the HTUC. As an alternative, researchers have recently proposed dual-decomposition strategies for addressing the UC, which enables solving subproblems in parallel. However, dualizing a non-convex problem generally results in a duality gap and requires adhoc techniques for recovering a primal solution. In this paper, we propose a novel cooperative multi-search Benders decomposition approach to solve the deterministic HTUC. Our approach benefits from being a primal method and, at the same time, it exploits the structure of the HTUC to solve subproblems in parallel. To assess the effectiveness of our proposal, we use the state-of-the-art solver Gurobi as a benchmark, and we perform our experiments on 25 cases of a large-scale system with over 1,000 generating units and 7,000 buses. On average, our approach is more than 15 times faster than Gurobi and it is able to solve the HTUC problems in under 20 min to a 0.1\% gap.},

Inevitable uncertainties of electrical, heating, cooling demands as well as the wind power generation are considered in this study. The proposed model is based on two-stage optimization problems and represented as a stochastic programming problem to address the effects of uncertain parameters. In order to address the uncertain parameters in the model, different scenarios have been generated by Monte-Carlo Simulation approach and then the scenarios are reduced by applying K-means method. In addition, the effects of demand response programs on the operational sub-problem are taken into account. Benders decomposing approach is adopted in this research to solve the complex model of coordinated planning and operation problem. The master problem is supposed to determine the type and capacity of hub equipment, while the operating points of these assets are the decision variables of the operational slave problem. As a result, the proposed mathematical model is expressed as a linear model solved in GAMS. The simulation results confirm that the Benders decomposition method offers extremely high levels of accuracy and power in solving this problem in the presence of uncertainties and numerous decision variables. Moreover, the convergence time is drastically decreased using Benders decomposition method.},

This work improves the energy prediction model and a task scheduling formulation, expressed in integer programming to maximize the number of tasks performed in nanosatellite missions. A realistic battery model is introduced in the formulation to extend battery lifetime. This is achieved by a disjunctive program that makes battery charge and discharge more efficient. Furthermore, fuzzy constraints are designed to limit the current rates (for charge and discharge) and the depth of discharge for battery lifetime preservation. Each battery access is penalized in the objective function, thereby stimulating energy consumption to match energy input. For simulation purposes, the varying power input was based on two-line element data of the CubeSat FloripaSat-I, operating in an orbit with J2 perturbation and an attitude that keeps one face of the nanosatellite towards the Earth for the entire orbit, similar to a remote sensing mission. The effectiveness of the task-scheduling methodology was shown by means of simulated experiments of representative scenarios. With the improvements proposed here, a robust and realistic framework for optimal offline scheduling of nanosatellite missions is achieved.},

	abstract = {The value and overall efficacy of a satellite mission are directly affected by its task scheduling strategy and the associated amount of work performed in orbit. Despite subject to many constraints, task scheduling is ultimately restricted by the amount of power available at any given moment. In this paper, we propose a mathematical integer programming (IP) formulation designed to maximize the number of tasks to be executed by a satellite, constrained to the amount of power available at any moment along the course of an orbit. The optimization model is formulated to contemplate task priority, minimum and maximum number of task activation, minimum and maximum execution time, minimum and maximum period of a given task and execution window. The variant power input vector was calculated based on the solar cells efficiency, and also on an analytical model used to estimate the irradiance field according to parameters of orbit and attitude. To demonstrate the applicability of our methodology, we conduct several experiments considering three satellite sizes with different orbits and task parameters. The results show that the proposed offline scheduling algorithm generates an optimal energy effective scheduling plan, allowing the best possible use of available energy resources while ensuring the quality of service (QoS).},

In this sense, this research proposes an offline energy-aware task scheduling problem formulation regarding the specifics of constellations, by considering whether the tasks are individual, collective, or stimulated to be redundant. By providing such an optimization framework, the idea of estimating an offline task schedule can serve as a baseline for the constellation design phase. For example, given a particular orbit, from the simulation of an irradiance model, the engineer can estimate how the mission value is affected by the inclusion or exclusion of individuals objects. The proposed model, given in the form of a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model, is illustrated in this work for several illustrative scenarios considering different sets of tasks and constellations. We also perform an analysis of the Pareto-optimal frontier of the problem, identifying the feasible trade-off points between constellation and individual tasks. This information can be useful to the decision-maker (mission operator) when planning the behavior in orbit.},

	abstract = {Due to the explosive growth and dynamic change of user demand, an efficient power and bandwidth allocation algorithm is quite essential for multibeam satellites with flexible digital payloads. To suit the real-time use of the multibeam satellites communication, we build a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) architecture for dynamic power and bandwidth allocation. For minimizing unmet system capacity (USC), the proposed DRL architecture adopts proximal policy optimization algorithm to directly allocate the resource in continuous space. Under the proposed DRL architecture, the DRL strategy for joint power and bandwidth allocation (named as pbDRL) reaps the best USC performance in comparison with the separate power or bandwidth allocation method of pDRL and bDRL. Besides, by implementing the allocation decision determined by pbDRL into the initial population of the existing genetic algorithm (GA), we also develop another improved GA, namely drlGA. Numerical results verify that (i) pbDRL outperforms the existing GA and PSO; (ii) pbDRL achieves comparable USC performance within a significantly reduced computation time compared with the existing optimized GA method; (iii) in comparison with the other three related heuristic algorithms, drlGA derives improved USC performance within the same computation time. These results draw a conclusion that the developed pbDRL and drlGA approaches are capable to meet the requirements of high timeliness and desirable demand satisfaction, respectively.},

The problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming model (MILP) with the objective to minimize the sum of the savings from closing the existing facilities, the expansion costs, the fixed setup costs, the facility operating costs and the transportation costs. The structure of the model motivates us to solve the problem using Benders decomposition algorithm. Three groups of valid inequalities are derived to improve the lower bounds obtained by the Benders master problem. By separating the primal Benders subproblem, different types of disaggregated cuts of the primal Benders cut are constructed in each iteration. A high density Pareto cut generation method is proposed to accelerate the convergence by lifting Pareto-optimal cuts. Computational experiments show that the combination of all the valid inequalities can improve the lower bounds significantly. By alternately applying the high density Pareto cut generation method based on the best disaggregated cuts, the improved Benders decomposition algorithm is advantageous in decreasing the total number of iterations and CPU time when compared to the standard Benders algorithm and optimization solver CPLEX, especially for large-scale instances.},

	abstract = {A general enhancement of the Benders'decomposition (BD) algorithm can be achieved through the improved use of large neighbourhood search heuristics within mixed-integer programming solvers. While mixed-integer programming solvers are endowed with an array of large neighbourhood search heuristics, few, if any, have been designed for BD. Further, typically the use of large neighbourhood search heuristics is limited to finding solutions to the BD master problem. Given the lack of general frameworks for BD, only ad hoc approaches have been developed to enhance the ability of BD to find high quality primal feasible solutions through the use of large neighbourhood search heuristics. The general BD framework of SCIP has been extended with a trust region based heuristic and a general enhancement for large neighbourhood search heuristics. The general enhancement employs BD to solve the auxiliary problems of all large neighbourhood search heuristics to improve the quality of the identified solutions. The computational results demonstrate that the trust region heuristic and a general large neighbourhood search enhancement technique accelerate the improvement in the primal bound when applying BD.},

Then, we propose a multi-layer network graph aggregation model for tasks with similarity and relevance features. Further, we transform the task scheduling problem into a zero–one programming problem and design task scheduling algorithms to solve the task scheduling timeliness problem.

In this paper, we study a distributed integrated modular avionic system of practical relevance where the scheduling includes to assign communication messages to time slots and to sequence tasks on modules. For this problem, the challenge is the huge number of tasks to be scheduled and the intricate interaction between the communication and task scheduling. We present a method based on Logic-Based Benders Decomposition (LBBD) to solve this problem. In a master problem, formulated as a mixed-integer program, communication messages are assigned to time slots and in a subproblem, formulated as a constraint program, tasks are scheduled. Our LBBD scheme is accelerated by using cut strengthening, a subproblem relaxation, and components for preprocessing and initialisation of the scheme. The cut strengthening is of the kind that systematically investigates subsets of variables to include in the cut by solving additional subproblems. To further enhance the efficiency of the scheme, we propose a new strategy that extends cut strengthening to also try to construct feasible solutions by using information from solving the additional subproblems. Our computational evaluation is based on publicly available instances with up to 2530 messages and 54,731 tasks. It shows that our method outperforms previous methods for the problem with respect to both solution times and RAM usage. A further evaluation of the different components in the method shows that our new acceleration strategy is important to achieve these results.},

A common solution approach for these models is Benders decomposition, in which a sequence of (possibly infeasible) solutions is generated, until an optimal solution is eventually found and the method terminates. As convergence may require a large amount of computing time for hard instances, the method may be unsatisfactory from a heuristic point of view. Proximity search is a recently-proposed heuristic paradigm in which the problem at hand is modified and iteratively solved with the aim of producing a sequence of improving feasible solutions. As such, proximity search and Benders decomposition naturally complement each other, in particular when the emphasis is on seeking high-quality, but not necessarily optimal, solutions. In this paper, we investigate the use of proximity search as a tactical tool to drive Benders decomposition, and computationally evaluate its performance as a heuristic on instances of different stochastic programming problems.},

	abstract = {Accurate ultra-short-term PV power forecasting is essential for the power system with a high proportion of renewable energy integration, which can provide power fluctuation information hours ahead and help to mitigate the interference of the random PV power output. Most of the PV power forecasting methods mainly focus on employing local ground-based observation data, ignoring the spatial and temporal distribution and correlation characteristics of solar energy and meteorological impact factors. Therefore, a novel ultra-short-term PV power forecasting method based on the satellite image data is proposed in this paper, which combines the spatio-temporal correlation between multiple plants with power and cloud information. The associated neighboring plant is first selected by spatial-temporal cross-correlation analysis. Then the global distribution information of the cloud is extracted from satellite images as additional inputs with other general meteorological and power inputs to train the forecasting model. The proposed method is compared with several benchmark methods without considering the information of neighboring plants. Results show that the proposed method outperforms the benchmark methods and achieves a higher accuracy at 4.73\%, 10.54\%, and 4.88\%, 11.04\% for two target PV plants on a four-month validation dataset, in terms of root mean squared error and mean absolute error value, respectively.},

To solve the above problems, eight features from battery usage of three processes are selected to comprehensively depict the change of battery capacity.

Singular value decomposition is implemented to extract the principal signals from satellite data and a novel method is applied to enhance ANN performance at high altitude. A three-layer feed-forward ANN model is trained with one year of daily GSR measurements at ten ground sites. This trained ANN is then used to map continuous daily GSR for two years, and its performance is validated at all 83 ground sites in China. The evaluation result demonstrates that this algorithm can quickly and efficiently build the ANN model that estimates daily GSR from geostationary satellite data with good accuracy in both space and time.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses several cases of the Offline Nanosatellite Task Scheduling (ONTS) optimization problem, which seeks to schedule the start and finish timings of payloads on a nanosatellite. Modeled after the FloripaSat-I mission, a nanosatellite, the examples were built expressly to test the performance of various solutions to the ONTS problem. Realistic input data for power harvesting calculations were used to generate the instances, and an instance creation procedure was employed to increase the instances\&rsquo; difficulty. The instances are made accessible to the public to facilitate a fair comparison of various solutions and to aid in establishing a baseline for the ONTS problem. Additionally, the study discusses the various orbit types and their effects on energy harvesting and mission performance.},

	abstract = {To improve surgical services and hospital performance, collaborative operating room planning and scheduling across a network of hospitals has recently emerged as a new challenge in both healthcare industry and academic community. The paper considers a novel distributed operating room scheduling problem (DORSP), in which elective patients planned on a given day are scheduled for surgeries in the distributed operating rooms of collaborative hospitals. Since hospitals are different in terms of specialization and medical expertise, some complicated surgeries in this problem can only be performed in a subset of collaborative hospitals. Based on the similarities between healthcare delivery systems and production systems, DORSP is modelled as a distributed two-stage no-wait hybrid flow shop scheduling problem with factory eligibility. To deal with the NP-hardness of DORSP, an adaptive-learning-based genetic algorithm (ALBGA) is proposed to generate collaborative surgery schedules. In addition to traditional genetic operators, ALBGA also applies an adaptive learning operator to enhance the search ability by mimicking human learning behaviours. Computational results on both small-sized and large-sized test problems show that ALBGA is competitive among the compared algorithms.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates a flexible job shop scheduling problem with uncertain processing time. The uncertainty of the processing time is characterized by a generalized grey number. We extract generalized grey numbers from limited information in real-world production, and then extend their operations for scheduling. With generalized grey numbers, the problem is formulated by a mathematical model to minimize the makespan. We develop an elite genetic algorithm for finding excellent solutions. The algorithm employs an elite strategy and neighborhood search method to search for promising individuals on the premise of ensuring population diversity. To assess the performance of the suggested methods, we construct 10 benchmark instances using generalized grey numbers. The results of the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and competitiveness of the proposed algorithm and characterization.},

	abstract = {Cell formation is one of the first and most important steps in designing a cellular manufacturing system. It consist of grouping parts with similar design features or processing requirements into part families and associated machines into machine cells. In this study, a bi-objective cell formation problem considering alternative process routings and machine duplication is presented. Manufacturing factors such as part demands, processing times and machine capacities are incorporated in the problem. The objectives of the problem include the minimization of the total dissimilarity between the parts and the minimization of the total investment needed for the acquisition of machines. A normalized weighted sum method is applied to unify the objective functions. Due to the computational complexity of the problem, a hybrid method combining genetic algorithm and dynamic programming is developed to solve it. In the proposed method, the dynamic programming is implemented to evaluate the fitness value of chromosomes in the genetic algorithm. Computational experiments are conducted to examine the performance of the hybrid method. The computations showed promising results in terms of both solution quality and computation time.},

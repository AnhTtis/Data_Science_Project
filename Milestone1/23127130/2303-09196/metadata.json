    "abstract": "In this work we consider law-invariant, coherent risk measures as a proxy-cost for data-driven expected risk minimization. We show how such risks serve as point-wise high-confidence upper bounds of the expected risk. The confidence level can be determined tightly for any number of samples. Conversely we also illustrate how to calibrate risk measures to act as a high-confidence upper bound with some user specified confidence. Numerical experiments then illustrate how the resulting proxy-cost both generalizes better and is less sensitive to tuning parameters compared to the usual empirical risk minimization approach.",

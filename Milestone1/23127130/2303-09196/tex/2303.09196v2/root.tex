\begin{abstract}
    We consider the worst-case expectation of a permutation invariant ambiguity set of discrete distributions
    as a proxy-cost for data-driven expected risk minimization. For this framework, we coin the term \emph{ordered risk minimization}
    to highlight how results from order statistics inspired the proxy-cost. Specifically, we show how such costs serve as 
    point-wise high-confidence upper bounds of the expected risk. The confidence level can be determined tightly for any sample size. 
    Conversely we also illustrate how to calibrate the size of the ambiguity set such that the high-confidence upper 
    bound has some user specified confidence. This calibration procedure notably supports $\phi$-divergence based ambiguity sets. 
    Numerical experiments then illustrate how the resulting scheme both 
    generalizes better and is less sensitive to tuning parameters compared to the empirical risk minimization approach.

    "abstract": "The Chekhov-Eynard-Orantin's topological recursion gives a Laplace dual representation of the Mirzakhani's recursion for the moduli space of bordered hyperbolic Riemann surfaces. Via the Andersen-Borot-Orantin's geometric recursion, a twist of the topological recursion is proposed, and a recursion for the Masur-Veech polynomials is uncovered. The purpose of this article is to explore the generalization of the Mirzakhani's recursion based on physical two dimensional gravity models related to the Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. For generalized Mirzakhani's recursions involving a Masur-Veech type twist, we derive Virasoro constraints and cut-and-join equations, and also show some computations of generalized volumes for the physical two dimensional gravity models.",

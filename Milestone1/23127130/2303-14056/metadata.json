    "abstract": "We propose a qubit basis composed of transverse spin helices with kinks. This chiral basis, in contrast to the usual computational basis, possesses distinct topological properties and is particularly suited for describing quantum states with nontrivial topology. By choosing appropriate parameters, operators containing transverse spin components, such as $σ_n^x$ or $σ_n^y$, become diagonal in the chiral basis, facilitating the study of problems focused on transverse spin components. As an application, we study the decay of the transverse polarization of a spin helix in the XX model, which has been measured in recent cold atom experiments. We obtain an explicit universal function describing the relaxation of helices of arbitrary wavelength.",

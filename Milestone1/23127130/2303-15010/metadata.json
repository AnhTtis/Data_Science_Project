    "abstract": "We explore a conjecture posed by Eswarathasan and Levine on the distribution of $p$-adic valuations of harmonic numbers $H(n)=1+1/2+\\cdots+1/n$ that states that the set $J_p$ of the positive integers $n$ such that $p$ divides the numerator of $H(n)$ is finite. We proved two results, using a modular-arithmetic approach, one for non-Wolstenholme primes and the other for Wolstenholme primes, on an anomalous asymptotic behaviour of the $p$-adic valuation of $H(p^mn)$ when the $p$-adic valuation of $H(n)$ equals exactly 3.",

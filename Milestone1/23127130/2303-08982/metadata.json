    "abstract": "Conducting precise electronic-vibrational dynamics simulations of molecular systems poses significant challenges when dealing with an environment composed of numerous vibrational modes. Here, we introduce novel techniques for the construction of effective phonon spectral densities that capture accurately open system dynamics over a finite time interval of interest. When combined with existing non-perturbative simulation tools, our approach can reduce significantly the computational costs associated with many-body open system dynamics.",

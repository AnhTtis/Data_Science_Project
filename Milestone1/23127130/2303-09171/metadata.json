    "abstract": "Recently, the explanation of neural network models has garnered considerable research attention. In computer vision, CAM (Class Activation Map)-based methods and LRP (Layer-wise Relevance Propagation) method are two common explanation methods. However, since most CAM-based methods can only generate global weights, they can only generate coarse-grained explanations at a deep layer. LRP and its variants, on the other hand, can generate fine-grained explanations. But the faithfulness of the explanations is too low. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose FG-CAM (Fine-Grained CAM), which extends CAM-based methods to enable generating fine-grained and high-faithfulness explanations. FG-CAM uses the relationship between two adjacent layers of feature maps with resolution differences to gradually increase the explanation resolution, while finding the contributing pixels and filtering out the pixels that do not contribute. Our method not only solves the shortcoming of CAM-based methods without changing their characteristics, but also generates fine-grained explanations that have higher faithfulness than LRP and its variants. We also present FG-CAM with denoising, which is a variant of FG-CAM and is able to generate less noisy explanations with almost no change in explanation faithfulness. Experimental results show that the performance of FG-CAM is almost unaffected by the explanation resolution. FG-CAM outperforms existing CAM-based methods significantly in both shallow and intermediate layers, and outperforms LRP and its variations significantly in the input layer.

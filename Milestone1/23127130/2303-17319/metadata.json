    "abstract": "Let $X$ be a compact strictly pseudoconvex embeddable CR manifold and let $T_P$ be the Toeplitz operator on $X$ associated with some first order pseudodifferential operator $P$. We consider $χ_k(T_P)$ the functional calculus of $T_P$ by any rescaled cut-off function $χ$ with compact support in the positive real line. In this work, we show that $χ_k(T_P)$ admits a full asymptotic expansion as $k\\to+\\infty$. As applications, we obtain several CR analogous of results concerning high power of line bundles in complex geometry but without any group action assumptions on the CR manifold. In particular, we establish a Kodaira type embedding theorem, Tian's convergence theorem and a perturbed spherical embedding theorem for strictly pseudoconvex CR manifolds.",

\begin{abstract}
  Compact Symmetric Objects (CSOs) form a distinct class of jetted active galactic nuclei (jetted-AGN). We examine a carefully selected sample of 54  CSOs, and confirm that there are two unrelated classes: an edge-dimmed, low-luminosity class (CSO 1), and an edge-brightened, high-luminosity class (CSO 2). Using statistically significant blind tests, we show that CSO 2s themselves consist of two morphologically distinct classes: CSO 2.0, having prominent hot-spots at the leading edges of narrow jets and/or narrow lobes; and CSO 2.2, without prominent hot-spots, and with broad jets and/or lobes. An intermediate class, CSO 2.1, exhibits mixed properties.  The four classes occupy different, overlapping, portions of the luminosity-size plane, with the sizes of  largest CSOs being $\sim 500$pc.  We advance the hypothesis that CSO 2.0s are young and evolve through CSO 2.1s into CSO 2.2s, which are old (up to $\sim 5000$ yr). Thus CSOs do not evolve into larger types of jetted-AGN, but spend their whole life cycle as CSOs. The radio emission region energies in the CSO 2s we have studied range from $\sim 10^{-4}\, M_\odot {c}^2$ to $\sim 7 \, M_\odot {c}^2$.   We show that the transient nature of CSO 2s, and their birthrate, can be explained through ignition in the tidal disruption events of giant stars. We also consider possibilities for tapping the spin energy of the supermassive black hole, and tapping the energy of the accretion disk, in a manner similar to, but not the same as, that which occurs in dwarf novae. Our results demonstrate conclusively that CSOs constitute a large family of AGN in which we have thus far studied  only the brightest.  More comprehensive radio studies, with higher sensitivity, resolution, and dynamic range, will revolutionize our understanding of AGN and the central engines that power them.

    \caption{The radio astronomer's  ``Hertzspung--Russell diagram''  \citep{1982IAUS...97...21B} for CSOs: The distribution in the Luminosity--Size $(P,D)$ plane of the 54~bona fide CSOs for which we have spectroscopic redshifts. Open square symbols: CSO~1 objects. Pink, green and brown filled circles:  CSO~2.0, 2.1 and 2.2 objects, respectively. Up arrows on symbols indicate CSOs with rising spectra below 1 GHz, for which we have only a lower limit on the peak luminosity. The light blue annuli around the symbols indicate objects in the complete PR+CJ1+PW samples. The diagonal dashed line, dividing the $(P,D)$ plane in two, has been drawn by eye to maximise the ratio of CSO~2.0 objects above the line to those below the line, and to maximise the ratio of CSO~2.2 objects below the line to those above the line. The references for the 54 radio emission maps in this Figure are indicated by the dagger symbol$^\dagger$ in the individual source notes in  Appendix~A. Many of the maps have their true sky orientations rotated for arrangement purposes.    CSOs for which there is evidence of more than one epoch of activity are indicated by double borders - i.e., the CSO~1: \# 42; the CSO~2.0s: \#3, \#50 and \#53; and the CSO~2.2: \# 28. In these five cases, the size plotted refers to the most recent activity (see text). Quasars are indicated by the letter ``Q''. The other CSOs are radio galaxies. The faint yellow, blue, and gray regions show the areas of the $(P,D)$ plane occupied by the CSO~2.0, CSO~2.2 and CSO~1 objects, respectively, making it clear that they predominantly occupy different regions of the $(P,D)$ plane (see text). }

 Compact Symmetric Objects (CSOs) are extragalactic radio sources less than 1\,kpc in extent that show emission from both sides of their center of activity \citep{1994ApJ...432L..87W}. From the earliest studies, CSOs have often been designated as ``young'' objects, or as objects showing ``recurrent'' activity \citep[see, e.g.,][]{1980ApJ...236...89P,1980ApJ...241L..73M,1988ApJ...328..114P,1990AA...232...19B,1992ApJ...396...62C,1996ApJ...460..612R,2014MNRAS.438..463O}.  In this study, we will show that these descriptors, ``young'' and ``recurrent'', are  misleading.  We find strong evidence supporting the hypothesis that CSOs exhibit a full life cycle from birth to death as CSOs, and so are not all ``young'' although they are almost all  ``short-lived'' when compared to other jetted-AGN. 

Throughout the previous CSO literature, the terms ``young'' and ``short-lived'' have been treated as synonymous. To avoid confusion with the earlier literature we will use the terms ``early-life'', ``mid-life'' and ``late-life'' to describe the different evolutionary  stages of CSOs.

This paper is the third of three papers on the morphological radio properties of CSOs in which we explore the phenomenology of CSOs uncontaminated by misidentified objects.  In the first paper (Kiehlmann et al. 2023a, submitted, hereafter Paper~1), we added two new criteria, based on variability and speed, to the CSO selection criteria and undertook a detailed survey of the literature, which enabled us to identify 79~bona fide CSOs, and we selected three flux-density-limited samples that have no spectral index selection criterion and are therefore suitable for statistical studies.  In the second paper (Kiehlmann et al. 2023b, submitted, hereafter Paper~2), we determined the fractions of CSOs in these complete flux-density-limited samples, and we used the subset of  17 bona fide CSOs in these complete samples that have spectroscopic redshifts to show that CSOs form a distinct subclass of jetted-AGN that has  sharp upper cutoff in size at $\approx 500$ pc.   




In a sample of 24 CSOs, all but three of which we have confirmed as bona fide CSOs, \citet{2016MNRAS.459..820T} discovered an important distinction in the morphologies of CSOs:  They found that there are two classes of CSOs that  mimic the Fanaroff and Riley (FR) Type~I and Type~II objects \citep{1974MNRAS.167P..31F}.  There is a class of CSOs, which \citet{2016MNRAS.459..820T} designated as CSO~1, that is edge-dimmed and of low luminosity, and there is a class of CSOs, designated as CSO~2, that is edge-brightened and high luminosity.   In this study we have confirmed these findings of \citet{2016MNRAS.459..820T}.  

In this paper  we show that $\sim 40\%$  of the bona fide CSO~2s we have identified are ``early-life'', $\sim 30\%$   are ``mid-life'', and $\sim 30\%$ are ``late-life''.  We then discuss the energies, ages, birth rates, and possible origins of CSOs in the context of single star capture, as was first suggested by \citet[hereafter R94]{1994cers.conf...17R}, with its implications for tidal disruption events \citep{1988Natur.333..523R} and the late stages of evolution of TDEs with radio jets (jetted-TDEs).  We also consider two other possible origins of the energy of CSOs, namely, the spin of the SMBH and the accretion disk.

An unfortunate development of the last 20 years in the study of CSOs  is that there are now many mis-classified CSOs in the literature.
In Paper~1 we carried out an extensive literature search to weed out the objects incorrectly identified as CSOs, ending up with a sample of 79~bona fide CSOs that is sufficient to explore the phenomenology, evolution, and origins of CSOs. 

Another potentially misleading descriptor in CSO studies is the use of the term ``recurrent'' for CSOs in which there is evidence of more than one epoch of activity. Five of our bona-fide CSOs  show evidence of more than one epoch of activity, with a distinct gap, or drop in surface brightness, between the emission regions associated with each episode. In our view it should not be assumed that any previous activity was a manifestation of the same physical process as that which produces CSOs.  For this reason we should use the descriptor ``episodic'',   rather than ``recurrent'', for this class of rare CSOs, which comprises $\sim$10\% of the bona fide CSOs we have identified. Four CSO 2 objects and one CSO 1 object, out of our total of 79 bona fide CSOs, were found to be episodic.

Many of the most crucial aspects of CSOs discussed in this paper were first discussed soon after the definition of this class by R94, including their relationship to FR~I and FR~II objects, and their lifetimes and energy requirements. R94 concluded that CSOs are short-lived as radio sources, and used morphological and statistical arguments, respectively, to show that CSOs do not evolve into either FR~I or FR~II objects, and that they form a distinct population of compact jetted-AGN. They pointed out that CSOs therefore provide a unique window on the central engines that drive AGN. R94 also realized that if CSOs do indeed form a distinct class of jetted-AGN, then there must be a physical reason for this distinction, and they suggested that CSOs might be the result of the capture of a single star by a SMBH in an otherwise quiescent
elliptical galaxy nucleus.  These issues were addressed in more detail in  \citet[hereafter R96]{1996ApJ...460..612R}.  In this paper we use  our sample of 54~bona fide CSOs with spectroscopic redshifts to explore the morphology, evolution, and origins of CSOs in more detail than has been possible in the past.  This has led to the discovery of evolution of CSO~2s, and a  more detailed examination  of the possible origins of CSOs in terms of single star capture, which are the main results of this paper.

 In this paper we follow the lead of  \citet{2021AARv..29....3O} in their comprehensive review of peaked spectrum sources, and refer to gigahertz peaked spectrum (GPS) sources as peaked spectrum (PS) sources.  



Throughout this paper we adopt the convention $S_\nu \propto
\nu^{\alpha}$ for spectral index $\alpha$, and, for consistency with our other papers, we use the cosmological
parameters $\Omega_m = 0.27$, $\Omega_\Lambda = 0.73$ and $H_0 = 71 \;
\mathrm{km\; s^{-1} \;\,Mpc^{-1}}$ \citep{2009ApJS..180..330K}. None of the conclusions would be changed were we to adopt the best model of the Planck Collaboration  \citep{2020A&A...641A...6P}.


\section{The Bona Fide CSO Sample}\label{sec:bonafide}

In this paper we focus on the 54  bona fide CSOs spectroscopic redshifts that we identified in Paper 1.  This sample is listed in \cref{tab:bonafides}.  Representative images of these 54 objects are shown in \cref{plt:linsizedist}. As first pointed out by  \citet{1982IAUS...97...21B}, ``This is the radioastronomer's H-R diagram, an analogy which two lines of algebra shows is exact''. To make it easy to associate the images with the source data,  the order in \cref{tab:bonafides} is the number of each object in \cref{plt:linsizedist}.    To facilitate looking up individual sources by name, a version of \cref{tab:bonafides} with the objects listed in order of right ascension is given in \cref{tab:bonafides2} in Appendix~B.  A short description of each source is given in Appendix A.



The distribution of our 54~bona fide CSOs between the CSO~1 and CSO~2 classes in the luminosity ($P$) -- size ($D$) plane is shown in \cref{plt:linsizedist}, where  CSO~1s and CSO~2s are represented by empty squares and filled circles, respectively.  We see that CSO~1s tend to have lower luminosities than CSO~2s, and hence tend to occupy a different region of the $(P,D)$ plane. The luminosities refer to that at the peak of each CSO's radio spectrum, and the size is measured from the radio contour maps, as described in Paper 1.  In six cases the peak occurs below the lowest frequency at which the source has been observed.  These are indicated by the up arrows in Fig.~\ref{plt:linsizedist}.



\section{CSO~1 and CSO~2 Classes}\label{sec:csoclass}

The sole criterion we apply to distinguish between CSO~1s and CSO~2s is the ``edge-dimmed'' {\it vs.}~``edge-brightened'' morphological criterion. We do not apply any luminosity constraints on either class. By ``edge-dimmed'' we mean that moving out from the center of activity the surface brightness drops.  By ``edge-brightened'' we mean that moving out from the center of activity the surface brightness first increases, but that it may drop towards the outer extremities of the source.

As can be seen from Fig.~\ref{plt:linsizedist}, there is a wide variety of CSO~2 morphologies, but we have managed to classify these using three sub-classes, which as we show later, likely corresponds to an evolutionary sequence.

\vskip 6pt
\noindent
CSO~2.0: These are CSOs in which there are two distinct outer lobes, making them edge-brightened, with hot spots  at their outer edges opposite the nucleus, narrow jets (if visible at all), and  lobes not much wider than the hot spots. These are indicated by pink symbols in \cref{plt:linsizedist}, with pink lines connecting their positions  in the $(P,D)$ plane to their corresponding images.

CSO~2.2:   These are CSOs in which there are two distinct outer lobes but the hot spots are not dominant or are invisible, or the lobes are well-resolved normal to the jet axis. The hotspot, or hot spots, do not need to be located at the end of the lobe opposite the core. These are indicated by brown points in \cref{plt:linsizedist}, with brown lines connecting the points in the $(P,D)$ plane to their corresponding images.

\noindent
CSO~2.1: These are ``indeterminate'', or ``intermediate'',  CSO 2s, which have some of the properties of CSO~2.0s and some of the properties of CSO~2.2s.  For example, they might look like CSO~2.0s on one side of the nucleus and CSO~2.2s on the other side. Or they might have hot spots that are not located at the extremities of their envelopes.  These are indicated by green points in \cref{plt:linsizedist}, with green lines connecting the points in the $(P,D)$ plane to their corresponding images. Three objects in this ``indeterminate'' class (\#27, \#33 and \#49 in \cref{plt:linsizedist}) have very peculiar morphologies that seem unrelated in any way to other CSO~2s, so they are ``indeterminate'', but the remainder are all mixtures of CSO~2.0 and CSO~2.2 morphologies, and may be designated as ``intermediate''. 


Our reasons for assigning each of the 54~CSOs to the four classes, CSO~1, CSO~2.0, CSO~2.1, or CSO~2.2, are given for each object individually in Appendix~A.

To ensure that we were not biasing the distributions of and conclusions about the different CSO~2 classes in the $(P,D)$ plane, and to assess the reliability and reproducibility of our CSO classification scheme, we carried out blind tests to classify the 54~bona fide CSOs for which we have spectroscopic redshifts.

\label{tab:binomial}
\end{deluxetable*}


To conduct the blind tests, we formed four independent teams each consisting of two of the co-authors of this paper. These tests were ``blind'' in the following two senses.  First, the four teams worked completely independently, with no knowledge of the classifications of the other three teams.  Second, the classifications were based on morphology alone, with no cognizance of redshift, physical size, and luminosity, thereby precluding any influence from location in the $(P,D)$ plane.   We re-classified three objects because not all of the relevant maps had been taken into account in the initial classifications (J0943+1702, J1158+2450 and J2327+0846) after we had finished the blind tests, but these re-classifications were done after completing the blind tests and carrying out the statistical tests on the blind tests, and so do not affect the statistical results of the binomial tests quoted below. 

The two members of each team individually classified the 54~CSOs, then compared their results and agreed on a team classification.  The results of the four teams' classifications are shown in \cref{tab:blindtests}.  The results show remarkable consistency, given the variety of morphologies observed, and the small number of classes. In 47\% of the cases all four teams agreed on the classification, in 85\% of the cases three or four teams agreed, in 5\% of the cases the classifications were split 2:2, and in 9\% they were split 2:1:1. The final classifications are also given in \cref{tab:blindtests}.

The numbers and fractions of CSOs in the different classes are given in Table \ref{tab:fractions}. The significance of these classifications can be tested against the hypothesis that the CSOs are randomly distributed. Results are given in \cref{tab:binomial}.  Since there are four classes and four teams, there are $4^4=256$ possible outcomes of the blind test on each of the 54~CSOs being classified. 

The probabilities shown in \cref{tab:binomial} are derived as follows.  There are four possible ways all four teams can choose the same classification ($p={4\over256}=0.0156$), and 4!~possible ways ($p = {24 \over 256} = 0.0938$) all four teams could choose different classifications. In the case of exactly three teams agreeing, the number of possibilities is (4 ways to pick the agreeing classification) $\times$ (3 ways to pick the non-agreeing classification) $\times$ (4 ways to arrange these) = 48 ($p = {48 \over 256} = 0.1875$). That leaves 180 ways that exactly two teams (or two pairs of teams) could choose the same classification ($p = {180 \over 256} = 0.7031$).

The probabilities, under the random assumption,  of agreement by all four teams, three or four teams, two teams, and by no teams, are given  in the third column of \cref{tab:binomial}. The differences between the actual numbers (fifth column) and the expected number (fourth column) are striking. 

The  binomial probabilities, shown in the seventh column of \cref{tab:binomial} leave no room for doubt that the classification system is one that is astrophysically meaningful, and therefore provides a useful description of CSOs.

In the cases of the three objects marked with a double dagger (\ddag), which includes one of the 2:2 splits, the objects were discussed and the final decision on the correct classification was unanimous.

\section{Distributions of CSOs Amongst the Different Classes}\label{sec:distributions}

As pointed out in Paper 2, there are many selection biases in this sample, and in particular there is a strong redshift selection bias, so the interpretation of the data on these 54 sources must be treated with care.  But the 54 CSOs populate the $(P,D)$ plane densely enough for us to be able to look for variations in morphology with $P$ and $D$.
It is important to consider any  biases that might affect the distribution of the four classes of CSOs in the $(P,D)$ plane. For this purpose we show  in Fig. \ref{plt:redshift} the redshift distributions of the different classes of CSOs. It is immediately clear that CSO 1s are seen predominantly at lower redshifts than CSO 2s.  This is undoubtedly a selection effect due to the fact that CSO 1s are low luminosity objects and that their symmetric regions, being edge-dimmed, are of low surface brightness.  Both of these effects will push high redshift  CSO 1s below the detection levels of the finding surveys, which have, thus far, been restricted to high flux densities. It is to be expected, therefore, that CSO 1s will be found at higher redshifts as the survey flux density limits are extended downwards.

    

We will not discuss the redshift distribution of CSO 2.1s since they have mixed CSO 2.0 and CSO 2.2 characteristics.  We therefore compare the redshift distributions of the CSO 2.0s and CSO 2.2s shown in Fig. \ref{plt:redshift}.  Although the two distributions overlap substantially, it appears, by eye, to be the case that the CSO 2.2s are concentrated at somewhat lower redshifts than the CSO 2.0s.  The Kolmogorov-Smirnoff two-sample test gives a KS test statistic of 0.55, and a p-value=0.0026.  So it is rather unlikely that these two distributions are drawn from the same parent population, although the possibility that they are cannot be ruled out definitively. 

 If this is due to selection bias, the implication is that our sample is missing CSO 2.2 objects at high redshifts.  This would not be surprising because, like the CSO 1 sources, CSO 2.2 objects lack bright hot spots and their lobes have lower surface brightnesses than those of CSO 2.0 objects.  Thus this selection effect is in the sense that it biases against  detecting CSO 2.2s in the lower right hand quadrant of the $(P,D)$ plane.  Since the selection effect actually biases against the trend we already see, our conclusions are robust

\subsection{Comparison of CSO~1s and CSO~2s}\label{sec:comp1vs2}
The distributions in size and luminosity of CSO~1s {\it vs.\/} CSO~2s are shown in \cref{plt:comp1vs2}. The sizes and luminosities are taken from Paper 1.  As in Paper~1, the ``peak luminosities'' are the luminosities at the frequency of the peak of the spectrum for CSOs with peaked spectra, and at the lowest observed frequency for 
CSOs with monotonically falling spectra. In \cref{plt:comp1vs2}  it can be seen that CSO~1s are on average smaller and less luminous than CSO~2s.     These are clearly two very different classes of objects: the CSO~1s tend to be nearby, low-luminosity objects, whereas the CSO~2s have higher luminosities that lie in the range FR~I and FR~II objects.

The distributions in  size and luminosity of CSO~2.0s {\it vs.\/} CSO~2.2s are shown in \cref{plt:comp2pt0vs2pt2}, where it can be seen that on average the CSO~2.0s are smaller than CSO~2.2s, and that their luminosities span the same range.
 The median size of the CSO~2.0s is 166\,pc, and the median size of the CSO~2.2s is 346\,pc, i.e., the ratio of the median sizes is $\sim 2:1$.
The median luminosities of CSO~2.0s and CSO~2.2s are $1.15 \times 10^{27}$ W\,Hz$^{-1}$, and $3.95 \times 10^{26}$ W\,Hz$^{-1}$, respectively,   i.e., the ratio of the median luminosities is $\sim 3:1$.

{\it Summary of Classifications in the $(P,D)$ Plane}: The areas of the $(P,D)$ plane occupied by the CSO~1s, 2.0s and 2.2s are shown by the faint gray, yellow and blue highlighted regions in \cref{plt:linsizedist}, respectively.  These make it clear that these different classes occupy different, but overlapping,  portions of the $(P,D)$ plane.
For the remainder of this paper we focus on the CSO~2 objects.



\section{The Evolution of CSO~2\lowercase{s} }\label{sec:evolution}

In this paper we aim only at a very basic approach to the evolution of CSO~2s.  We wish to determine whether or not there is clear evidence for the evolution of CSO~2s in the $(P,D)$ diagram shown in \cref{plt:linsizedist}.


We see in \cref{plt:linsizedist} that CSO~2.0s are all larger than 20\,pc.  If we consider only the region of the $(P,D)$ diagram  above 20\,pc, we see that   there is an apparent tendency  for the
CSO~2.0s to be located more toward the upper left hand side  (yellow region) of the
distribution, and the CSO~2.2s to the lower right hand side (blue region).





%In order
%to quantify any division  between the CSO~2.0 and CSO~2.2 
%classes in the $(P,D)$ plane, we used the SVC support vector
%machine algorithm from the python sklearn.svm library with a linear
%kernel. The diagonal dotted line represents the maximum margin
%hyperplane that segregates the two classes  (based
%only on $P$ and $D$), which in Fig. %\ref{plt:linsizedist} can be
%characterized as $\log{P} = 1.98 \log{D} + 22.22$.


%We refer the reader to \cref{plt:linsizedist}, where we have drawn a diagonal dotted line that maximises the ratio of pink:brown points above the line and maximises the ratio of brown:pink points below the line.

We have shown in Paper~2 that CSO~2s constitute a distinct population of jetted-AGN that is not related to other classes of jetted-AGN, including CSS, PS, FR~I and FR~II objects, and that the CSO size distribution cuts off well below the 1\,kpc CSO selection criterion.  We now advance the hypothesis that CSO~2s pass through all the stages of their evolution, from birth through death,  as CSOs.



  In \cref{plt:linsizedist} we see that there is an upper envelope of the CSO~2s that rises from $P\sim 10^{25}$ W\,Hz$^{-1}$ at $D\sim 10$\,pc to $P\sim 3 \times  10^{28}$ W\,Hz$^{-1}$ at $D\sim 500$\,pc.  There are no major selection effects that could be responsible for this upper envelope. There is a minor selection effect in the upper left corner caused by the smallest angular size CSOs that are recognizable in centimeter-wavelength VLBI surveys ($\sim 6$ mas). CSOs smaller than $\sim 20$\,pc need to be located at $z \lesssim 0.2$ in order to have at least this minimum angular size. If the CSO luminosity function is steep, then within this small co-moving volume element the most likely CSOs in a flux-density-limited survey  will have low luminosities. This can result in an apparent deficit of high-luminosity, small size CSOs. Above 20\,pc, the upper envelope must reflect the true upper envelope on CSO~2s in the $(P,D)$ plane.  It almost certainly, therefore, represents roughly the evolutionary trajectory of the most luminous CSO~2s as they are increasing in luminosity and expanding in size.

\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{NewComparison2.0svs2.pdf}
    \caption{Comparison of CSO~2.0s and CSO~2.2s. (a) The distributions of the largest projected linear sizes. (b) The distributions of the peak luminosities.}
    \label{plt:comp2pt0vs2pt2}
\end{figure*}



In \cref{plt:linsizedist} we see that there is a rather less distinct lower envelope of the CSO~2s that is more or less flat at $P\sim 10^{24}$\,W\,Hz$^{-1}$ from $D\sim 10$\,pc to  $D\sim 500$\,pc.  There are several selection effects  responsible for the lack of objects below  $P\sim 10^{24}$\,W\,Hz$^{-1}$, including spectral index, and surface brightness sensitivity limits, but these do not affect our discussion of the evolution of CSO~2s for the reasons discussed at the beginning of \S \ref{sec:distributions}.

Clearly, all CSOs begin their evolutionary lives with low luminosity and small size, so they begin off the bottom left of the $(P,D)$ diagram.  As they evolve, CSO~2s increase in both size and luminosity, so they must follow a path that rises towards the top right of the $(P,D)$ plane.  At some point, for as yet unknown reason(s),
they stop growing in size, and it seems likely that the luminosity peaks a little earlier than this.  In other words, we envision that the luminosity peaks at some point and begins to drop, after which CSO~2s increase very little in size. Also, the luminosity and size reach maximum values, $(P_{\rm max},D_{\rm max}) $, well before the objects reach a projected size of 1\,kpc, as shown in  Paper~2.  Note that both $P_{\rm max}$ and $D_{\rm max}$ can be different for each CSO.


This evolutionary path, from lower left to upper right in the $(P,D)$ plane, and the bifurcation in the morphologies of CSO~2.0s and CSO~2.2s, shown by the yellow and blue regions of the $(P,D)$ plane in \cref{plt:linsizedist}, prompted us to approximately separate these two classes in the $(P,D)$ plane by drawing the dashed line from bottom left to upper right.  The dashed line in \cref{plt:linsizedist} has been drawn by eye to to maximise the ratio of CSO~2.0s above the line to those below it,  and to maximise the ratio of CSO~2.2s below the line to those above it. 

The numbers and fractions of CSOs 2s in the three sub-classes are shown in \cref{tab:distributions}.  These are striking: we see that the fractions of CSO~2.0s and CSO~2.2s each flip by a factor $\sim 10$ across this line, while the fraction of CSO~2.1s is virtually unchanged.
 In \cref{plt:linsizedist}  the points  in the upper left half of the figure are predominantly pink (CSO~2.0), while below it they are predominantly brown (CSO~2.2). This is clearly not a random effect, and we have shown in \S \ref{sec:distributions} that the only selection bias we have been able to conceive of goes in the opposite direction. 
 For these reasons we hypothesize that the observed bifurcation of the CSO 2.0 and CSO 2.2 classes in the $(P,D)$ plane is due to the evolution of CSO 2s. 



If we now imagine the trajectory of an individual CSO~2 in the $(P,D)$ plane, we see that the stages of growth and decay will match those  of the $(P,D)$ plane that are dominated by the pink and brown points, respectively.  We suggest, therefore that CSO~2.0s (pink points) are objects that are increasing in both $P$ and $D$, and that CSO~2.2s (brown points) are objects that have stopped increasing in both $P$ and $D$, and have evolved off the growth curve. Given this scenario, and given that CSO~2.0s are on average significantly smaller than CSO~2.2s, we would expect the separation speeds, $v_{\rm s}$,  of the outer edges of the lobes straddling the nucleus to be higher in CSO~2.0s than in CSO~2.2s.  We return to this point in the next section.

We note that the spread in CSO~2 luminosities at small $D$ is at least a factor of $10^2$, so it appears that the CSOs below the upper envelope in \cref{plt:linsizedist} are a mixture of unevolved ``early-life'', intermediate ``mid-life'', and evolved ``late-life''  objects.  This is seen clearly in the distribution of pink, green and brown points.

Thus, in our view, the distribution of CSO~2s in the $(P,D)$ plane shown in \cref{plt:linsizedist} shows clear evidence of evolution in the morphology of CSO~2s, such that ${\rm CSO \;2.0 } \rightarrow {\rm CSO \;2.2}$, with a possible intermediate class of CSO 2.1, starting from an initial spread of $\sim 2$ orders of magnitude in peak luminosity.  

Note that the CSO 2.1 sources exhibit features common to both CSO 2.0s and CSO 2.2s. In addition, as shown in Table \ref{tab:distributions} they are much more evenly distributed across the dashed line that demarcates the regions dominated by the CSO 2.0s and 2.2s.  In both respects, they are intermediate in properties between the CSO 2.0s and the CSO 2.2s. It is for these reasons that we regard them as an intermediate step between CSO 2.0s and CSO 2.2s in the evolutionary sequence, and refer to them as ``mid-life''.  However, it remains possible that CSO 2.1s   are not necessarily a mid-life stage between CSO 2.0s and CSO 2.2s but may represent CSO~2s in asymmetric environments which causes one side to experience turbulence but not the other. Such  asymmetry could be caused by an environment with an average velocity parallel with the CSO jet axis, inducing a high Reynolds number in one jet but not the other. Additionally the ambient density may not be symmetric about the core, leading to the observed differences in the two CSO~2.1 lobes. In any case, CSO~2.1 represent a middle-ground between CSO~2.0s and CSO~2.2s in appearance and physical properties.

\section{The Ages of CSO~2\lowercase{s}}\label{sec:ages}
 

\citet{1998AandA...337...69O} discussed the separation speed of the CSO 0710+439 in detail, and found that the hot-spot separation speed is $ v_{\rm s} = (0.354\pm0.041)c$ (assuming $H_0 = 71 \,{\rm km \, s^{-1} \, Mpc^{-1}}$).  From this and the size of the source they derived an age of $1100 \pm 100$ years, and concluded that CSOs are short-lived. \citet{2005ApJ...622..136G} carried out a detailed study of 20~CSOs for which they could estimate the ages, or lower limits to the ages. They measured kinematic ages that ranged from $20\pm 4$\,yr to $3000 \pm 1490$\,yr.  Combining their kinematic ages with those of \citet{2003PASA...20...69P} they found that 7~out of 13~CSOs had kinematic ages below 500\,yr. They also showed that the ages dropped off steeply above $\sim 2000$\,yr, and concluded that CSOs could not evolve into FR~I or FR~II objects.


\citet{2003PASA...20...69P} considered the separation speed of the hot spots in eight of our bona fide CSOs. An unweighted average of their data yields $v_{\rm s} = (0.30 \pm 0.04)c$, for $H_0 = 71 \,{\rm km \, s^{-1} \, Mpc^{-1}}$. 

The evolutionary hypothesis we are proposing in this paper predicts that CSO~2.0s should, on average, have higher separation speeds than the CSO~2.2s, which have likely slowed down. So we should be able to differentiate between CSO~2.0s and CSO~2.2s when considering CSO separation speeds. Returning to the study of  \citet{2003PASA...20...69P}, we find that 5 of their 10 objects are bona fide CSO~2.0s, and for these their results yield a hot-spot separation speed of $v_{\rm s} =(0.36\pm0.04) c$. For the remainder of this paper we assume, therefore, that the mean separation speed of CSO 2.0s is $v_{\rm s} =(0.36\pm0.04) c$, and we assume this separation speed for {\it all\/} CSO 2s during ``early-life''. 

The distribution of ages for the 44 CSO~2 objects for which we have spectroscopic redshifts, assuming a constant hot-spot separation speed of $0.36 c$, is shown in \cref{plt:prcj1pwages} (a).  In Paper~2 we showed that there are 17 bona fide CSOs with spectroscopic redshifts in the complete samples of Pearson and Readhead (PR) \citep{1988ApJ...328..114P}, the first Caltech--Jodrell Bank survey (CJ1) \citep{1995ApJS...98....1P}, and the Peacock and Wall (PW) survey \citep{1982MNRAS.198..843P}.  The distribution of ages for these 17 CSOs, assuming a hot-spot separation speed of $0.36c$, is also shown in \cref{plt:prcj1pwages}(a). We note that the ages in both of these samples extend to $\approx$5000 yr, so we will use 5000 yr as the typical lifetime of the CSOs we are discussing.  The dependence of luminosity on age for the CSO~2s in the complete PR+CJ1+PW sample is shown in \cref{plt:prcj1pwages}(b).  The least squares power law fit (i.e. the fit of the logarithm of the peak luminosity to the logarithm of the age) has slope 
$b=1.26\pm 0.35$, so, to within the errors, the peak luminosity is found to be proportional to the age. This suggests that CSO~2s are being fuelled at a more or less constant rate over their $\sim 5000$ yr lifetimes.

In Fig. \ref{plt:linsizedist} the CSO 2s in complete samples are indicated by the light blue annuli around the points.  We see that there are eight CSO~2.0s, three CSO~2.1s, and six CSO~2.2s.  Thus, in complete samples, the number of ``early-life'' CSO 2s, is about the same as that of  ``late-life'' CSO 2s, and these are both significantly larger than the number of CSOs in the ``mid-life'' phase.  We conclude that that CSO 2s spend roughly half their lifetimes in the ``early-life'' expansion phase while their luminosities are increasing, then pass through the ``mid-life'' stage quickly, and spend about half their lifetime in the ``late-life'' phase.   Since, as seen in Fig. \ref{plt:linsizedist}, both CSO 2.1s and CSO 2.2s have lower peak luminosities than CSO 2.0s of comparable size, we assume that the luminosity begins to drop off significantly once CSO 2s pass from the ``early-life'' to the ``mid-life'' stage.

\begin{figure*}
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{Combinedspeedmapsnew4.pdf}
   \caption{Three illuminating examples of CSO~2.0s and  CSO2.2s, selected to illustrate speed comparisons. CSO~2.0s: (a): J0713+4349 \citep{1998AandA...337...69O}; (b): J1247+6723 \citep{2003PASA...20...16M}; (c): J1511+0518 \citep{2012ApJS..198....5A}; CSO~2.2s: (d): J0119+3210 \citep{2003AandA...399..889G}; (e) J0131+5545 \citep{2020ApJ...899..141L}; (f) J1158+2540 \citep{2008ApJ...684..153T}.

    \label{plt:sixmaps}
\end{figure*}






It is difficult to measure the separation speeds in CSO~2.2s because they usually do not have bright hot spots at the outer edges of their outer lobes; however, in cases where they can be measured, they are found to be lower than for CSO~2.0s.  For example,  in the CSO~2.2 object J2355+4950 \citet{2003PASA...20...69P} measured a hot-spot separation speed of $(0.12\pm0.03) c$, and the CSO~2.2 object J1945+7055 has a hot-spot separation speed of $(0.024 \pm 0.006)c$ \citep{2009ApJ...698.1282T}. So the CSO 2.2 object J2359+4950 has a separation speed of about one third that of the average CSO~2.0, whereas in the CSO 2.2 object J1945+7055 the separation speed is about one seventh of the average CSO~2.0 separation speed. 

In \cref{plt:sixmaps} we compare the separation speeds in three CSO~2.0s with three CSO~2.2s, chosen to illustrate and explore the possible differences in morphology and separation speeds in these two classes. The CSO~2.0s are shown in panels (a), (b), and (c), while the CSO~2.2s are shown in panels (d), (e), and (f).  

The separation speeds of the three CSO~2.0s are easy to determine because they have well-defined hot spots at the leading edges of their outer lobes.  These are $(0.52 \pm 0.03)c$, for J0713+4349 \citep{2003PASA...20...69P}; $(0.24 \pm 0.015)c$, for J1247+6723 \citep{2003PASA...20...69P}; and 
$(0.19 \pm 0.03)c$, for J1511+0518 \citep{2012ApJS..198....5A}.

The separation speeds of the CSO~2.2s in \cref{plt:sixmaps} are less straightforward because of the absence of hot spots at the leading edges of their lobes.  We therefore discuss these individually below.

\subsection{Separation speed in the CSO~2.2 J0119+3210}\label{sec:J0119}

\citet{2003AandA...399..889G} have carried out a detailed  study of the motion of components in J0119+3210. The speeds they derive for various components are shown in \cref{plt:sixmaps}(d), where we highlight components E1, E2 and W1 with red arrows. \citet{2003AandA...399..889G} derived a significant separation speed between components E2 and W1.  However, we see that component E1 is closer to the leading edge of the eastern lobe, and  is moving almost due south.  It is by no means clear to us, therefore, that the outer edges of J0119+3210 are actually separating, and that the measured relative motions do not apply to components moving along the jets. 


\subsection{Separation speed in the CSO~2.2 J0131+5545}\label{sec:J0131}

In Fig.~\ref{plt:sixmaps}(e) we show the stacked 15\,GHz image of \citet{2020ApJ...899..141L} and their measured velocities (red arrows) of the components C1, C8, and C5 relative to component C0, which they assume to be stationary in the rest frame of the central engine. 


We propose here a different interpretation of these relative motions based on the morphologies of  the CSO~2.2s J0111+396, J0713+4345, and J2355+4950, which were studied in detail by R96 and \citet{1996ApJ...463...95T}, who showed  that the nuclei are not coincident with bright components.     \citet{2020ApJ...899..141L} have identified the nucleus of J0131+5545 as component C0. We suggest that, as with the above three CSOs, the nucleus in J0131+5545 is not coincident with the bright component C0. The jet axis is almost east-west, and, using the velocities measured by \citet{2020ApJ...899..141L}, shown by the red arrows, we find that C1 is moving west with a speed of $(0.166 \pm 0.007)c$ relative to C0,    while C5 is moving west with a speed of $(0.188 \pm 0.013)c$ relative to C0.  Thus, the difference between C1 and C5 in westward motion relative to C0 is $(0.022 \pm 0.015)c$, consistent with zero. We suggest, therefore, that the nucleus lies between components C0 and C8, and  that component C0  is moving eastward relative to both the nucleus and the two outer components, C1 and C5.  Subtracting off the mean westward speed of $(0.177 \pm 0.015)c$ from the speeds derived by \citet{2020ApJ...899..141L}, shown by the red arrows, we derive the speeds shown by the green arrows.  On this interpretation, the outward motion of the lobes has stopped and the material at the outer edges of the lobes at C1 and C5 is moving almost normal to the jet axis and parallel to the interface of the lobe with the interstellar medium.

\begin{figure*}

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{P-DEvolution.pdf}
    \caption{CSO~2s in the $(P,D)$ plane: pink circles - CSO~2.0; green triangles - CSO~2.1; brown squares  - CSO~2.2. The faint yellow and blue regions show the areas of the $(P,D)$ plane occupied by the CSO~2.0 and CSO~2.2 objects, respectively. In this log-linear plot the size cutoff and evolution from CSO~2.0 to CSO~2.2 is more clear than in the log-log plot of Fig.~1. Note the absence of any CSOs in the size range 600 pc -- 1000 pc.  This shows the abrupt cutoff in CSO size well before reaching the nominal cutoff imposed by the CSO size selection criterion, as discussed in detail in Paper 2. }
    \label{plt:evolution}
\end{figure*}


 


Note that on this alternative interpretation, the speeds of components C0 and C8, which we assume to straddle the central engine, are oppositely directed and of similar speed.  Thus, while components C0 and C8 might represent a newly reborn CSO and a new phase of activity, as  proposed  by \citet{2020ApJ...899..141L}, in this paper we adopt the alternative explanation that these are simply high surface brightness regions of the jets, such as are commonly seen in CSO 2s. There are now more VLBI data from 2022 which may help to determine which interpretation of the motion is correct, and we are pursuing this analysis in greater detail, but it may well require VLBI astrometry to settle this question.






\subsection{Separation speed in the CSO~2.2 J1158+2540}\label{sec:J1158}
In \cref{plt:sixmaps}(f) we have over-plotted the 5\,GHz map (gray contours) and the 15\,GHz map (green contours) of J1158+2540 observed by \citet{2008ApJ...684..153T}.  The core is seen clearly in the 15\,GHz map, and is indicated by the letter ``C''.  The CSO is aligned north-south, and  \citet{2008ApJ...684..153T} found that the separation of the peaks in these components appears to be decreasing.
This is very likely a result of the``dentist's drill'' effect \citep{1974MNRAS.166..513S,2019MNRAS.482.3718P}, but it does indicate a very slow speed of advance or even that the advance has stopped.  From the morphology of this object, as seen clearly in the multi-frequency maps of \citet{2008ApJ...684..153T}, the advance does appear to have stopped while the source expands normal to the jet axis. 

\vskip 6pt \noindent
{\it Summary and conclusion:} Thus, where we can measure them, the speeds of CSO 2.2s are on average less than those in CSO 2.0s. Our conclusion from this section is therefore that, based on the small number of objects for which measurements are available, the separation speeds of CSOs are consistent with the evolutionary hypothesis that CSO~2.0s evolve into CSO~2.2s.  Our hypotheses regarding the negligible separation speeds in J0119+3210 and J0131+5545 could be checked by astrometric VLBI. 







\section{The Energies of CSO 2\lowercase{s}}\label{sec:energies}
In this section we estimate the radio emission energy requirements for CSO~2s. We first point out that the highest luminosity  CSO~2s in Fig.~1---i.e., numbers 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19---are all highly asymmetric.  It is  likely that the emission from these objects is slightly relativistically boosted, and we therefore exclude them from our energy estimates. In our selection of CSOs we deliberately specify only that emission should be seen on both sides of the nucleus, without requiring that the emitting regions straddling the nucleus have comparable flux densities.  We do this in order  not to exclude CSOs with emission regions that are mildly beamed towards the observer from our sample.  However, for the purposes of energy calculations, any objects suspected of having flux densities boosted even by factors of a few should clearly be excluded.  From Fig.~1, we see, therefore, that the most luminous CSO~2s suitable for the discussion of the energies of CSO~2s have luminosity $\sim 3 \times 10^{27}$\,W\,Hz$^{-1}$.


R94 pointed out that the energy requirements for CSO~2s are $\sim 1 M_\odot\,c^2$, and suggested that CSOs are formed via single star capture by a quiescent SMBH in an elliptical galaxy nucleus. R96 carried out a detailed study of the PR CSOs, and estimated that the maximum energy requirement of CSOs is $\sim 20 M_\odot c^2$.  We show below that this estimate is a factor $\sim 2$--3 too high.  Note that these energy estimates are based solely on the radio emission regions, and do not include any energy associated with the X-ray and $\gamma$-ray emission, nor do they include any energy expended in expanding into the surrounding medium.

R96 used multifrequency global VLBI observations with continuous 12-hour tracks, so their maps of the CSOs in the PR sample are of as high quality as is obtainable today with VLBI.  Using their measured flux densities and angular sizes  for the model-fitted components in J0111+3906 and J2355+4950, we have recalculated the R96 equipartition energies in these objects for the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology.  The total equipartition energy requirements of J0111+3906 and J2355+4950 are given in Table \ref{tab:energies}.


The multifrequency global network VLBI maps of R96 provide the most accurate total equipartition energy estimate of a CSO for J2355+4950.  We therefore develop a scaling relation relative to J2355+4950 to provide a quick method of estimating the approximate equipartition energy for any CSO~2, for which one has the peak luminosity, and the lobe size.

  The total equipartition energy, $U_{_{\rm T,eq}}  \propto L_{\rm bol}^{4/7}\, D_{\rm lobes}^{9/7}$ \citep{1990agn..conf.....B,2011hea..book.....L}, where $L_{\rm bol}$ is the bolometric luminosity and $D_{\rm lobes}$ is the physical size of the radio emitting region. Since $L_{\rm bol}$ scales with the peak luminosity, we see that $U_{_{\rm T,eq}}  \propto L_{\rm peak}^{4/7} D_{\rm lobes}^{9/7}$. The peak luminosities of J0111+3906 and J2355+4950 are $1.54\times 10^{27} \,{\rm W \,Hz^{-1}}$ and $3.95\times 10^{26} \,{\rm W\,Hz^{-1}}$, respectively.  Their mean lobe sizes are $\sim 1.5$ pc and $\sim 47$ pc, respectively.  The equipartition energy values derived from the maps and model fitting of R96, adjusted to the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, and by the scaling relation, are shown in \cref{tab:energies}.

\label{tab:energies}
\end{deluxetable}



We next consider the smallest and weakest CSO~2.2 in our sample, J0131+5545, which is shown in Fig.~1 \#41, and in Fig.~\ref{plt:sixmaps}(e). This is is a ``late-life'' CSO in  which the energy supply has likely been switched off, or is rapidly decreasing, so that this object has very likely reached its energy peak.  We use the observed values of  flux densities and spectral indices from \citet{2020ApJ...899..141L}, and an estimated mean lobe size from their maps of 4.5 mas, i.e., 33 pc (see Fig.~\ref{plt:sixmaps} [e]), to obtain an observed total equipartition energy of 0.051$M_\odot \,c^2$.  

Given these observed measures of the total equipartition energies in CSO~2s, and the general agreement with the  scaling relation, we can be confident that the maximum energy observed in CSO~2s may be estimated from the  observed peak luminosity of $3 \times 10^{27}$ W/Hz, and mean lobe size of $\sim 50$ pc. Scaling this to the energy of J2355+4950, we find that the maximum total equipartition energy of CSO~2s is $\sim 7 M_\odot \, c^2$.

The least luminous CSO~2 in our sample is the CSO~2.1 object \#43 in Fig.~1, J1205+2031 (NGC 4093). This CSO has been mapped with the European VLBI Network by \citet{2021MNRAS.506.1609C}. From their 5\,GHz VLBI image we have estimated the angular sizes and flux densities of the two lobes, and, assuming a spectral index of $\alpha=-0.7$ for both lobes, we obtain a total energy of $\sim 1.5 \times 10^{-4} M_\odot \, c^2$ for this object.

We see, therefore, that the energies of CSO 2s observed thus far range from $\sim 1.5 \times 10^{-4} M_\odot\, c^2$ to $\sim 7 M_\odot \, c^2$.  This refers only to the energy associated with the radio emitting regions. The total energies of CSO 2s, including the X-ray and $\gamma$-ray emission and the work done in expanding into the interstellar medium likely increases the total energy by a factor of a few.

\section{Multiple Epochs of Activity in CSO 2\lowercase{s}}\label{sec:multiple}

In the course of the literature search described in Paper~1, we also searched for any CSOs in which there was evidence of a previous epoch of activity.  We identified these objects through gaps in the emission between the small-scale and larger-scale features, or through dramatic reduction in surface brightness between the small-scale and the large-scale structure.  Amongst the 79 bona fide CSOs we identified in Paper 1,  we found 4 bona fide CSO 2s showing evidence of previous epochs of activity, which are shown in Fig.~\ref{plt:twoepochs} and listed in Table \ref{tab:previous}.

 %Given the extreme rarity of CSO 2s it is clear that if they are formed by the capture of a massive star, the likelihood of two such events in the same galaxy is extremely low.  Thus evidence of multiple CSO 2 events in the same galaxy would provide definitive evidence against the single-star-capture hypothesis of the origin of CSO 2s. 

 We have calculated the energies of the larger components in these CSO 2s, which are listed in Table \ref{tab:previous}.   As can be seen in the table, these energies exceed those of CSOs by at least a factor 30. It should be born in mind that these relics of an earlier epoch of activity are no longer being fuelled and thus the energies calculated here for the larger components are likely considerably lower than the total energy associated with the earlier active phase.
 
 
 We have also measured the position angles of the innermost jetted features of the CSOs and compared these with the large-scale structure.  The differences in position angle, $\Delta$PA, are shown in Table \ref{tab:previous}.  We note that in the case of the CSO 0108+388, the jet bends from an initial $\Delta$PA $\sim 46^\circ$ towards $\Delta$PA $\sim 0^\circ$  in the north-eastern jet, and a similar bend is seen in the south-western jet.  This could be due to pressure gradients in the interstellar medium of the host galaxy.

  Because of their seemingly different origins, we conclude that there is no reason to reject the single star capture hypothesis on the basis of the evidence of previous epochs of activity in some CSO 2s. It is entirely possible that single star capture could have occurred in a galaxy that previously hosted an AGN fuelled through a different means. In this scenario, jet launching during the renewed period of activity may indeed be favored by the presence of a fossil, magnetized disk \citep{Kelley2014}. A weak jet was inferred for the nearby TDE ASASSN-14li \citep{pvv18}, and a powerful relativistic jet was inferred for the candidate TDE VT\,J024345.70$-$284040.0 \citep{2022arXiv220702873S}, both of which exhibited weak AGN activity prior to the tidal disruption events.

The physical properties of CSO host galaxies can inform our understanding of their formation channels. If CSOs are caused by discrete accretion events, like tidal disruption events as hypothesized by this work, we may expect that their host galaxies would show specific features. For example, TDE properties are likely to  correlate with the SMBH mass. In this section, we constrain the physical properties of the CSO host galaxies. We focus on the galaxy stellar and black hole masses. We briefly and qualitatively comment on the presence of star formation and AGN activity.

We only consider those six CSOs for which we have a high-quality archival spectrum from \cite{1996ApJS..107..541L}. Our CSOs are sufficiently distant that, in some cases, public survey photometry alone is not sufficient to set reliable constraints on the galaxy properties, so we conservatively focus on the subsample with spectra.


% , as was done by, e.g.,  \cite{2010ApJ...713.1393W}. This work used {\it Spitzer} infrared spectra to constrain the star formation, AGN activity, and black hole masses of a sample of CSOs at $z\lesssim 0.1$. In this section, we 

We measure host galaxy stellar masses by fitting the galaxy spectral energy distributions (SEDs). We simultaneously fit the galaxy spectrum and public photometry. We adopt the spectra presented by \cite{1996ApJS..107..541L}. We mask out any regions affected by nebular emission, sky lines, or standard star features. We perform optical/IR photometry for each of these objects using images from the Pan-STARRS and WISE surveys, respectively. We use the \texttt{LAMBDAR} code \citep[][]{2016ascl.soft04003W} to obtain psf-matched aperture magnitudes, where the fiducial aperture is defined as $2.5\times$ the Kron magnitude in the Pan-STARRS $r$-band image to define the fiducial aperture size. We then simultaneously fit the photometry and spectra for each galaxy using the \texttt{bagpipes} code \citep[][]{2018MNRAS.480.4379C}. We assume a $\tau$-model star formation history, \cite{2000ApJ...533..682C} extinction, and a fixed metallicity. We do not include any AGN component, which could affect the results. We include three additional components to enable the spectrum fit: we float the velocity dispersion, a second order polynomial calibration vector, and a white noise component to account for any underestimated systematic uncertainties. We perform the fit using recommended procedures, and report the resulting stellar masses and $1\sigma$ uncertainties in Table~\ref{tab:masses}. These masses are consistent within a factor of ${\sim}0.5$ dex with results obtained using just the photometry, and using simple mass-to-light ratio scaling relations \citep[e.g.][]{2003ApJS..149..289B}; we are confident that the stellar masses are all $\log M_*/M_\odot \gtrsim 11$.

If the observed light includes a significant contribution from AGN emission, these masses are likely overestimated. We do not expect this to be the case, however, based on the optical spectra. All the optical spectra are broadly consistent with old elliptical galaxies. The optical spectrum for J0111+3906 looks like a typical quiescent galaxy. No strong [O\,III] emission or other emission lines are detected, and stellar absorption features consistent with old stars are visible. The remaining CSOs show AGN-like emission lines (e.g., [O\,III], [N\,II] emission), similar to Seyfert galaxies. No obvious broad components are detected. The stellar continuum is weak for most of these five, but absorption features consistent with old stars are weakly detected in a few. Given the lack of strong broad emission lines from this subsample or other features suggesting a bright AGN continuum, we do not expect that the stellar masses are hugely overestimated.

We can convert these stellar masses to black hole masses using the bulge mass-black hole mass relation from \cite{2013ARA&A..51..511K}: 
\begin{align}
    \frac{M_{\rm BH}}{10^9\,M_\odot}= 0.49^{+0.06}_{-0.05}  \big(\frac{M_{\rm bulge}}{10^{11}\,M_\odot}\big)^{1.16\pm0.08};\nonumber \\ 
    \,{\rm intrinsic\,scatter}=0.29\,{\rm dex}.
\end{align}
We assume $M_* \approx M_{\rm bulge}$, as is appropriate for elliptical galaxies. The resulting black hole masses are reported in Table~\ref{tab:masses}. For galaxies with $M_* \gtrsim 10^{11}\,M_\odot$, the black hole masses are $M_{\rm BH} \gtrsim 5\times10^8\,M_\odot$. 

CSO host galaxies properties have previously been considered by \cite{2010ApJ...713.1393W}, who used {\it Spitzer} mid-infrared spectra and photometry to study the stellar populations, AGN activity, and black hole masses of an inhomogeneously selected sample of eight nearby CSOs ($z\lesssim 0.1$). Most of their CSOs show evidence for AGN activity and moderate star formation; one did not show detectable AGN/star-formation emission. This is qualitatively similar to the objects discussed in this section, although our data set is very different from that used by \cite{2010ApJ...713.1393W} so we cannot perform a like-to-like comparison. They find black hole masses in the range $10^{8.2-8.8}\,M_\odot$, which are significantly lower than our BH masses which are in the range $10^{9.3-10.1}\,M_\odot$. This trend may be in part caused by the higher redshifts of our objects, which are in the range $z\approx 0.2-0.7$.

 \label{plt:histogramredshift}
\end{figure*}

More likely, much of the difference may be caused by differences in the methodology used to compute the black hole masses. \cite{2010ApJ...713.1393W} adopt a calibration that measured the relation between $V$-band bulge luminosities and black hole mass for AGN; we adopt the more recent and, arguably, robust \cite{2013ARA&A..51..511K} calibration measured for classical bulges and elliptical galaxies. It is established that the \cite{2013ARA&A..51..511K} is an upward revision of previous black hole mass relations, as discussed in that work. Moreover, as mentioned earlier, we are also using distinct data sets from \cite{2010ApJ...713.1393W}. A like-to-like comparison of our sample to \cite{2010ApJ...713.1393W} would require a detailed and uniform study of the host galaxy properties of all these objects, which is beyond the scope of this work. Instead, we think it conservative to simply state that the CSOs from both our sample and that from \cite{2010ApJ...713.1393W} tend to have similarly high black hole masses $\gtrsim 10^8\,M_\odot$.

\section{The  Birth Rates of CSO~2\lowercase{s} and TDE\lowercase{s}}\label{sec:birthrate}

We have seen in Paper 2 that the redshift distribution of our sample of 54 CSO~s is strongly affected by selection bias. By considering only the PR+CJ1+PW complete samples, we can use the CSO~2 ages derived above to estimate the birth rate of CSO~2s.  For these objects, from \cref{plt:prcj1pwages} we see that the oldest CSO~2s are estimated to have ages of $\sim 5000$ yr, assumed here to be the typical CSO lifetime.  
In \cref{plt:histogramredshift} we show the redshift distribution for the PR+CJ1+PW complete samples as well as that of the CSO~2s in these complete samples.  Apart from the outlier, J1227+3635, at $z=1.975$, we see that the CSO~2s are approximately uniformly distributed in redshift out to a redshift of $z = 0.9$.  It appears, therefore, that CSO~2s began to appear in appreciable numbers at a redshift of $z\sim 0.9$, i.e., about 7 Gyr ago.  

  We now make a very rough estimate of the birth rate of CSO 2s, which we refine in the next section.  Given the lifetime of $\sim 5000$ years, this  means that there is a probability of $\sim 5\times 10^3/7\times 10^9 \sim 7 \times 10^{-7}$ of seeing a particular CSO at the present time, for the moment ignoring that fact that objects at high redshifts cannot be seen over the whole 7 billion years because of the light travel time, which we calculate correctly in the next section. The comoving volume of the universe out to redshift $z=0.9$ is  $\sim 120 \; {\rm Gpc}^3$, so the space density of CSO 2s that is required to observe one CSO 2 at the present time is $\sim 1/(7 \times 10^{-7}\times 120)\;{\rm Gpc}^{-3}=1.2 \times 10^4 \; {\rm Gpc}^{-3}$, and the birth rate, given that we observe 16 CSO 2s out to redshift $z = 0.9$, is $\sim 16 \times 1.2 \times 10^4/ 7 \times 10^9\;{\rm Gpc}^{-3}\,{\rm yr}^{-1} \sim 3\times 10^{-5}\;{\rm Gpc}^{-3}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. 

  

  



  \subsection{The Tip of the Iceberg}\label{sec:tip}
  
  The birth rate of $\sim 3 \times 10^{-5}\;{\rm Gpc}^{-3}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$  is based on the PR+CJ1 and PW samples, which are complete down to 0.7 Jy at 5 GHz and 1.5 Jy at 2.7 GHz, respectively. Because of the steepness of the luminosity function, we are only sampling the most luminous CSOs in each redshift range.  The samples are therefore luminosity limited depending on the redshift of the CSOs.   We have divided  16 CSOs into redshift bins of width $\Delta z = 0.1$ out to a redshift of $z=0.9$, as shown in Figs. \ref{plt:birthrates}(a) and (b), and then one bin covering $0.9<z\leq 1.975$ to accommodate the lone CSO at $z=1.975$ (J1227+3635).  The colors of the panels in Fig.~\ref{plt:birthrates}(b) indicate  $\Delta z  =0.1$ bins and are diluted versions of the colors show in Fig.~\ref{plt:birthrates}(a). We calculate the CSO luminosities in Fig.~\ref{plt:birthrates}(b) as the average luminosity in each bin. All bins show luminosity variations of a factor $<3$, so we do not expect this choice to significantly affect our results. In future work, with a larger CSO sample, we will perform a rigorous likelihood analysis to calculate the CSO luminosity function and birth rate; based on preliminary tests applying such a framework the sample from this work, we do not expect that result will be significantly different from that found using simplified calculation performed here, so we choose to adopt this simpler, more intuitive methodology.
  
  The luminosity cutoffs corresponding to 1.5\,Jy (the PW sample) and 0.7\,Jy (the PR+CJ1 sample)  are shown as a function of redshift by the green and blue dashed  curves in Fig.~\ref{plt:birthrates}(b), respectively. We see that the three CSO 2s we have observed in the redshift range $0.0<z<0.1$, which all have luminosities below $4 \times 10^{25} \;{\rm W\, Hz^{-1}}$ would have fallen below the flux density limits in the higher redshift bins. Similarly, the four CSO 2s we have observed in the redshift range $0.1<z<0.3$, which all have luminosities below $4 \times 10^{26} \;{\rm W\, Hz^{-1}}$, would have fallen below the flux density limits in the higher redshift bins.  It is clear, therefore, that in these flux-density-limited complete samples we are seeing only the tip of the iceberg, i.e., only the most luminous CSO 2s in each redshift range.

  The solid line in Fig.~\ref{plt:birthrates}(a)  is the least squares fit to the log(birthrate) {\it vs.} log(luminosity) data of the CSOs, and has slope $-1.27 \pm 0.15$.  The upper and lower $1\sigma$ limits on the slopes are indicated by the dotted lines in Fig.~\ref{plt:birthrates}(a).

The birthrate analysis may offer a prediction of the finite-lifetime scenario for CSO 2s. Multi-epoch wide area radio surveys such as the VLA Sky Survey \citep[VLASS;][]{Lacy2020} and those with SKA pathfinders \citep[e.g,][]{Murphy2013} should be able to detect the births of CSO 2s as radio transients. For example, VLASS is sensitive to $\sim1$\,mJy transients that rise over the six years between epochs \citep[e.g.,][]{Dong2021}. To a distance of 1\,Gpc, where the VLASS sensitivity limit corresponds to $1.2\times10^{23}$\,W\,Hz$^{-1}$, the survey should observe the birth of $\sim50$ CSO 2s. Likewise, transient searches performed by comparing the FIRST survey to VLASS are sensitive to ${\sim}1-2$ decade timescale transients, and could observe the birth of CSOs. Dong et al., in prep., has identified all FIRST versus VLASS transients hosted by galaxies within 200 Mpc, and found ${\sim}2$ events that are consistent with being young CSOs. This is consistent with expectations: given the selection criteria used in Dong et al., in prep., we would expect ${\sim}1$ new CSO to be detected. Significant caveats to these predictions are that the ultimate luminosity of a CSO 2 is likely not attained near birth, and, as, we have seen in Fig. \ref{plt:prcj1pwages}(b), there is a correlation between the (peak) luminosity of a CSO 2 and its age. Nonetheless, time-domain radio surveys furnish us with the opportunity to characterize the processes driving the births of powerful radio AGN.

\subsection{The Birth Rates and Radio Luminosities Of Jetted-TDEs}\label{sec:tderate}

The  birth rate of jetted-TDEs has been shown to be weakly constrained to be (0.003-1)$\times$  the total TDE rate by \citet{2020NewAR..8901538D}, which implies a birth rate of $3-1000 \;{\rm Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}}$.  This range is indicated by the  red and gray hatched region in Fig. \ref{plt:birthrates}. The luminosity of jetted TDEs can be estimated roughly from the observed maximum radio flux density at multiple wavelengths  of $\approx$10 mJy for AT2022cmc \citep{2022Natur.612..430A}: In a source at rest emitting isotropically,  observed distantly with a flux density $S'$, and in which the jet is continuous, the observed flux density is $S= {\cal D} ^{2-\alpha}S'$ \citep{1979Natur.277..182S}, where  ${\cal D}$ is the Doppler factor:
\begin{equation}
{\cal D} =\frac1{\Gamma(1-{\vec{\beta}}\cdot{\vec{ n}})}
\end{equation}
and $\Gamma=(1-\beta^2)^{-1/2}$ is the Lorentz Gamma factor. 

Here we use the Lorentz gamma factor, $\Gamma=12$,  for AT2022cmc \citep{2022Natur.612..430A}, and we assume the angle between the jet axis and the line of sight is $\theta \sim 1/\Gamma$, at which angle $\Gamma= {\cal D} $ so that the luminosity for the off-axis TDEs is  reduced by the factor $ \Gamma^2$, assuming spectral index $\alpha=0$. We have therefore reduced the peak flux density of AT2022cmc of $\sim 10$ mJy observed in this on axis jetted-TDE to 0.07 mJy, which corresponds to a peak luminosity of $6.5 \times 10^{23}\;{\rm W \, Hz^{-1}}$ for the unbeamed jetted-TDE for comparison with the luminosities of the (unbeamed) CSO 2s.  This upper cutoff is indicated by the fading red and gray hatched bar in Fig. \ref{plt:birthrates}.

The remaining  99 \% disappear before reaching a size of 500 pc and an age of 5000  yr. }

\section{A Hypothesis Regarding Fuelling of CSO 2\lowercase{s} and FR II\lowercase{s}}\label{sec:coherent}

The SMBH in the central engines of FR II objects, such as Cygnus A (Fig.~\ref{plt:cygnusA} bottom panel), are continuously fuelled for $\sim 10^7$ yr. We propose the hypothesis that CSO 2s (Fig.~\ref{plt:cygnusA} top panel)  are continuously fuelled for timescales of years to $\sim 5 \times 10^3$ yr, and that something truncates the fuelling of CSO 2s after this time, otherwise they would, no doubt, go on to become FR IIs. This fuelling disparity between CSO 2s and FR IIs has no obvious explanation.

 Paper~2 provides compelling evidence for a sharp cutoff in size of CSO~2s at $\approx 500$ pc.  This is consistent with our interpretation of the above evolutionary sequence in this paper in the sense that the evolutionary sequence, which is based on morphology alone, without reference to the sizes, suggests that an upper size cutoff must exist for CSO~2s. This relationship between evolution and size cutoff can be seen clearly in \cref{plt:evolution}, where the CSO~2.0s are generally smaller than the CSO~2.2s and of greater luminosity at the same size range.

As can be seen from \cref{plt:linsizedist} and \citet{1974MNRAS.167P..31F}, the luminosities of CSO~2s and FR~IIs  \citep{1974MNRAS.167P..31F} cover the same range from $\sim 10^{25}$ W/Hz to $\sim 10^{28}$ W/Hz. Note that these CSO~2 luminosities are at the peak frequency, which, as can be seen in Paper 1, in almost all cases lies between 100\,MHz and 10\,GHz.  However, the total energies of the most luminous CSO~2.0s are approximately 6000 times less than the total energy of Cygnus A ($\sim 7 \times 10^{58}$ erg), which we have calculated based on the flux densities, angular sizes,  and spectral indices for the different components of Cygnus A given by \citet{1974MNRAS.166..305H}.  


So it appears that had CSO~2s simply continued at the same luminosity for $\sim 10^3-10^4 \times$ longer, they would have evolved into FR~IIs, like Cygnus A, with comparable kpc sizes and total energies.   



Clearly, in CSO~2s there is a physical process operating that does not operate in FR~II objects. This unknown physical process terminates CSO~2 development as jetted-AGN after a few tens of years up to 5000\,yr or so.  As pointed out in R94, one simple way to accomplish this might  be through a single isolated fuelling event, such as stellar capture.

  In the case of Cygnus A, the fuelling of the central engine has been continuous for the last $\sim 10^7$ yr \citep{1991ApJ...383..554C}, producing a jet of the same power and luminosity that we see in CSO 2s, but that has persisted for 1400 times longer. 

The fact that CSO 2s only began to appear in significant numbers about 7 billion years ago, at redshift $z = 0.9$, may support the hypothesis of a single isolated fuelling event, because prior to that time there was significantly more galaxy merging providing fuelling to AGN, which would drown out any effects due to the capture of a single star. On the other hand, galaxy mergers can also enhance the TDE rate \citep{Pfister2019}, and partial stellar disruptions may also play a significant role in fuelling SMBHs of the mass considered herein with order unity duty cycle \citep{Macleod2013}. However, self-consistent modeling of TDE rates with the SMBH mass function and star-formation histories \citep{Kochanek2016} robustly predict that TDE rates drop precipitously with redshift for all SMBH masses, consistent with the redshift distribution of the CSO 2 population. Further, if CSO 2s of the luminosities exhibited by our sample require SMBHs as massive as those inferred above, evolution in the SMBH mass function also supports the late appearance of the CSO 2 population. 


The  highly statistically significant cutoff in the size of CSO 2s discussed in Paper 2 cannot be due to episodic fuelling, because that would not produce the observed sharp cutoff in the numbers of CSOs at around 500 pc.  Random fuelling could produce a slow drop-off in the numbers of CSOs, but not the abrupt change that is observed.  







\section{CSO 2\lowercase{s} and TDE\lowercase{s}}\label{sec:TDEs}


The cutoff in physical size of CSO~2s, for which we presented the evidence in Paper~2, is clearly telling us something important about the origins and nature of this unique class of jetted AGN. It should not, of course,  be assumed that all CSO 2s have  the same origin, but Occam's razor should apply and we should consider multiple origins only when demanded by the phenomenology.  Since we are not able, as yet, to make a compelling case for the origin we here investigate different possibilities.

As suggested by R94, one interesting possibility is a single fuelling event, through the capture of a single star by a quiescent SMBH in a galactic nucleus---in other words a tidal disruption event (TDE). We therefore first consider TDEs and the possibility that CSO~2s are formed by the capture and tidal disruption of a single star by a dormant SMBH in an elliptical galaxy nucleus. Note that we do not consider intermittent feeding because we have eliminated that possibility in Paper 2.   

In the following, we first demonstrate the plausibility of \textit{some} CSO~2s being formed through TDEs. We then compare the CSO~2 birthrate with the expected rate of TDEs for the SMBH masses we derive above, and show that it is possible that \textit{all} CSO~2s represent TDEs. We finish by identifying certain predictions of the TDE hypothesis for CSO~2s. 

\subsection{CSO2\lowercase{s} powered by TDE\lowercase{s}}

TDEs occur when stars pass within the tidal radius, $R_{T}$, at the pericenter of their orbit around an SMBH. The tidal radius depends primarily on the stellar radius, $R_*$, the stellar mass, $M_*$, the SMBH mass, $M_{\rm BH}$, and on the internal stellar structure. Neglecting the effects of SMBH spin, the ratio of $R_{T}$ to the Schwarzschild radius is \citep[e.g.,][]{Macleod2012}
\begin{equation}
R_{T}/R_{S} \approx 1.6 m_{*,3}^{-1/3} m_{\rm BH,9}^{-2/3} r_{*,10} \, ,
\end{equation}
where $m_{*,3} \equiv M_*/3M_{\odot}$, $r_{*,10} \equiv R_*/10R_{\odot}$, and $m_{BH,9} \equiv M_{\rm BH}/10^{9}M_{\odot}$. Stars that are not massive enough or too compact will be disrupted within the event horizon, and the results will thus be invisible. 

The characteristic timescale on which post-TDE bound material falls back onto the SMBH is the fallback timescale, $t_{\rm fb}$. Defining $\beta$ as the ratio between the stellar-dynamical timescale, $\sqrt{R^{3}/GM_{\rm BH}}$, and the pericenter passage timescale ($R_{p}/v_{p}$, where $R_{p}$ is the pericenter radius and $v_{p}$ is the corresponding stellar velocity), the fallback timescale is given by \citep{1988Natur.333..523R}
\begin{equation}
t_{\rm fb}\approx 37\beta^{-3} m_{\rm BH,9}^{1/2} m_{*,3}^{-1} r_{*,10}^{3/2}\,{\rm yr}\,.
\end{equation}
Encounters with small impact parameters will have $\beta\gg1$. The fallback timescale is defined in terms of accretion of the most bound material. Following this time, the accretion rate is expected to taper according to a power-law decay, with an index of $-5/3$ expected for a flat distribution of disrupted material in orbital-energy space. Hydrodynamical simulations of TDEs find rough agreement with this scenario for a variety of stellar types, although the power-law slopes of the accretion-rate decay depend sensitively on the nature of the disruption (e.g., impact parameter) and the stellar structure \citep[e.g.,][]{Macleod2012,GR2013,Norman2021}. The maximal accretion rate can be estimated as the ratio $M_{*}/t_{\rm fb}$:
\begin{equation}
\dot{M}_{\rm max} \approx 0.08 \beta^{3} m_{\rm BH,9}^{-1/2} m_{*,3}^{2}r_{*,10}^{-3/2}\,{\rm M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}}\,.
\end{equation}

We also show evolutionary tracks for solar-metallicity stars of $1M_{\odot}$, $5M_{\odot}$, $10M_{\odot}$, $30M_{\odot}$, $80M_{\odot}$, and $200M_{\odot}$ interpolated from the MESA Isochrones and Stellar Tracks \citep[MIST;][]{MIST}.

For example, a $1M_{\odot}$ star can be disrupted by a $10^{9}M_{\odot}$ SMBH for $\sim4/100$ of its lifetime.}
    \label{plt:rad_mass}
\end{figure}


Only massive and/or post main sequence stars can be observably disrupted by SMBHs of the $\gtrsim10^{9}M_{\odot}$ masses inferred for the CSO~2 sample herein. Figure~\ref{plt:rad_mass} shows the regions of the stellar radius-mass space where disruption is possible, together with sample stellar evolutionary tracks. The figure indicates that disruption is not possible for the most massive CSO-2 SMBHs for most of the lifetimes of most stars. We note however that the treatment of the extended envelopes of the most massive ($\gtrsim100M_{\odot}$) stars in the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophyscs \citep[MESA;][]{Paxton2018} may not be entirely accurate based on observations of WNh stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud \citep{Grafener2021}. The precise amount of mass donated to an SMBH in either a full or partial disruption (e.g., of just an envelope), and whether or not disruption occurs for different $\beta$ and SMBH spins, requires numerical simulations. For example, \citet{Macleod2012} performed detailed simulations of the disruption of stars with masses up to $5M_{\odot}$ and showed that $>10^{9}M_{\odot}$ SMBHs could only disrupt such stars in post main sequence phases. In general, the maximal accretion rate will be much less than the  Eddington  rate. 

The energetics and timescales of CSO~2s are consistent with expectations for TDEs around the most massive SMBHs. Any given TDE around a $\gtrsim10^{9}M_{\odot}$ SMBH is much more likely to be a post main sequence star of one to a few solar masses, rather than a $\gg10M_{\odot}$ star. Although the $80M_{\odot}$ star in Figure~\ref{plt:rad_mass} spends over half its lifetime in a region where a TDE is possible, its lifetime is only $\sim4$\,Myr, and the $5M_{\odot}$ star spends $\sim10$\,Myr in the TDE region of the plot. We now consider the minimum stellar mass for which a TDE can power a CSO~2 jet, which in a fiducial case requires $\sim1M_{\odot}c^{2}$. This can be approximately equated to the total accreted mass (see below) for the sub-Eddington mass-supply rates under consideration, and for a rapidly rotating SMBH. We note that although the relativistic TDE Swift J1644$+$57 converted just $\sim1\%$ \citep{Cendes2021} of the rest-energy of the approximately solar-mass disrupted star \citep{Sasha2014}, such events are entirely different from CSO~2s given the initial super-Eddington accretion phase and prompt jet launching. Then, as approximately a third of the mass of an evolved star will be accreted \citep{Macleod2012}, the fiducial scenario assumed above of a $3M_{\odot}$ horizontal-branch star with a radius $10R_{\odot}$ is energetically reasonable for a CSO~2. The rise and decay timescales of the accretion will approximately be contained within a century. A somewhat more massive star in an AGB phase (AGB-star disruptions contribute a smaller fraction of the envelope mass to accretion) disrupted by a $10^{9.5}M_{\odot}$ SMBH can easily accommodate the $\sim10^{3}$\,yr durations inferred for the CSO~2s considered here. 

\subsection{Comparing the CSO2 and TDE rates}

The CSO~2 birthrate of $\sim3\times10^{-5}$\,Gpc$^{-3}$\,yr$^{-1}$ can be compared with the empirical TDE rate of $\sim10^{3}$\,Gpc$^{-3}$\,yr$^{-1}$ found by \citet{svv2018}. A direct comparison is fraught with uncertainty. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item First, the IMF in nuclear regions, and in particular for stars in CSO~2 host galaxies on radial orbits, may be substantially different to the field IMF in the Galaxy. For example, \citet{2005MNRAS.364L..23N} have argued that the IMF in the centers of galaxies is top-heavy by at least a factor 10. \citet{2007ApJ...669.1024M} have presented compelling evidence for a long-standing top-heavy IMF in the central parsec of our own galaxy based on the work of \citet{2006ApJ...643.1011P}.  They conclude that the model that fits the observations best has IMF slope $x=-0.85$, in comparison with the \citet{1955ApJ...121..161S} IMF slope of $x = -2.35$. More recent observations on a larger sample have shown the IMF in the center of our galaxy to be extremely top-heavy with $x=-0.45$ \citep{2010ApJ...708..834B}. There is indeed evidence for the preferential disruption of $\gtrsim2M_{\odot}$ stars in nearby TDE hosts \citep{Mockler2022}. The uncertainty in the IMF needs to be convolved with the prospect of evolved-star disruptions contributing significantly  to the putative CSO~2 TDEs.

    \item Second, the fraction of disruptions that result in radio emission from relativistic jets is largely unconstrained by the observations thus far. Although it is possible to consider the fraction of relativistic TDEs in relation to the overall TDE population \citep[e.g.,][]{2022Natur.612..430A}, these relativistic TDEs are potentially very different to the TDEs that could correspond to CSO~2s. The inferred accretion rates are disparate by more than four orders of magnitude, and the selection of impact parameters, SMBH spins, and pre-existing AGN activity is unknown. Additionally, evidence is mounting for delayed radio emission in a wider sample of TDEs \citep{Horesh2021,2022arXiv220702873S}, and the full extent of this phenomenon is yet to be observed. A recent review \citep{colle_lu2020} posits that the fraction of TDEs that launch jets is largely unconstrained in the range of $3\times10^{-3}-1$.

    \item Third, evolution in the SMBH mass function, and stellar populations available for disruption, must be accounted for in comparing local TDE rates with the higher-redshift CSO~2 sample. This latter effect may result in a near order-of-magnitude decline in the total TDE rate between $0<z<1$ \citep{Kochanek2016}. 

\end{itemize}
  
We nonetheless argue that the CSO~2 birthrate is consistent with expectations from the TDE rate. For SMBH masses $\lesssim10^{8}M_{\odot}$, consistent with most TDEs observed as transients, giant stars are likely to contribute 10\% of the rate \citep{MT1999,Macleod2012}. Approximately $3\times10^{-4}$ of the SMBHs in the local universe have masses in excess of $10^{9.4}M_{\odot}$ \citep{Shankar2009}, representing the typical SMBH masses of the CSO~2 sample. The remaining factor of $10^{3}$ discrepancy can be explained by the need to disrupt the most massive evolved stars (or even more massive main-sequence stars) likely in the tips of the red giant or AGB sequences, possibly on deeply plunging orbits, and potentially in the presence of previous AGN activity and/or a rapidly spinning SMBH. Further, as indicated in Figure~\ref{plt:birthrates}, an extrapolation of the birthrates of CSO~2s is consistent with the range of relativistic-TDE birthrates inferred by \citep{colle_lu2020}, assuming a maximum luminosity consistent with observed relativistic TDEs \citep{2022Natur.612..430A}. This hints at a continuum of jet powers between the TDEs observed as transients and CSO~2s, where the abscissa is determined by several factors including SMBH properties, and the physical properties and orbits of the disrupted stars. 

\subsection{Predictions of the CSO~2 TDE scenario}

Although it is plausible that CSO~2s can be explained by TDEs around the most massive SMBHs, testable predictions of this scenario are required in order to proceed. First, evidence for significant ongoing accretion, in particular $\gg10^{-4}$ of the Eddington rate, should be absent from CSO~2s. Identifying a sample of slowly evolving nuclear transients that can be linked to evolved-star TDEs around lower-mass SMBHs can determine the corresponding rate, and enable tests of the outcomes of extended slow accretion, in particular with regards to jet launching. 

We are only seeing the highest luminosity CSO 2s in each redshift range. The lowest-luminosity CSO 2s in our complete samples have luminosities $\sim 3 \times 10^{25}\; {\rm W\, Hz^{-1}}$ but the lowest luminosity CSO 2s we have observed have luminosities $\sim 10^{23}\;{\rm W\, Hz^{-1}}$. 

As shown in Table \ref{tab:energies} with the object J1205+2031 (\# 43 in Fig.~\ref{plt:linsizedist}),  the radio energy requirement is  four orders of magnitude lower than for a fiducial CSO 2 (J2355+4950). The energy requirement is only  $\approx 10^{-4}M_\odot {\rm c^2}$, well within the energy range of current TDEs.  So it is clearly possible to observe CSO~2s that have both energy and  luminosity comparable to those of TDEs caused by $\approx 1 M_\odot$ stars.


We suggest, therefore, that these low energy CSO~2s are indeed the results of TDEs of $\approx 1 M_\odot$ stars, and that as we explore smaller CSO~2s at these low energies we will be able to form a connection with TDEs.  A number of the bona fide CSO~2s have estimated ages in the 100--200\,yr range.  It is to be expected that as we push to higher resolution and lower flux densities, and continue to apply the CSO~2 selection, we will find CSO 2s in the 10--20 yr age range. This presents the prospect of studying the initial formation events in archival survey data. 

We can push our limits on complete samples down a factor 10 by observing the steep spectrum CSOs in the sample that complements the flat spectrum VLBA Imaging and Polarimetry Survey (VIPS) sample \citep{2007ApJ...658..203H}, and we have undertaken a program to do just this. 










\section{Relativistic Jet Scenarios}\label{sec:conuncon}

If the expanded classification of CSO~2s into CSO~2.0s, 2.1s, and 2.2s represents a continuum of CSO evolution, as we contend, a coherent physical model should describe their sourcing and morphology. We now return to the topic of CSO~2 ignition and evolution discussed in \S\,\ref{sec:evolution} and \S\,\ref{sec:TDEs}, and interpret it in the context of a uniquely-fueled relativistic jet propagating into an external medium.  

\subsection{Fueling by Quasi-stationary Disks}

\subsubsection{Inflow Models}

The traditional way to discuss the energetics of massive black holes in galactic nuclei is to suppose that the black holes are essentially dormant until they are supplied with gas. If this happens through an orbiting disk at a steady rate $\dot M$ under the action of a local (usually magnetic) torque, then the radiant luminosity is $L=\epsilon\dot Mc^2$, where $\epsilon$ is the radiative efficiency \citep{shakura73, balbus91}. For a thin disk, which is commonly believed to be appropriate when the mass supply rate is modest, relative to the Eddington rate, $\epsilon$ is related to the binding energy of the innermost stable circular orbit, ISCO, which depends on the black hole spin, and leads to an estimate $\epsilon\sim0.05-0.4$. For $r \gg r_{\rm ISCO}$, the outward transport of angular momentum and energy by the torque contributes to the dissipation at a rate three times the local release of gravitational binding energy. Energy is conserved because a zero torque boundary condition at the ISCO leads to a deficit in the release of energy by the disk, close to the ISCO. The energy released is presumed to be radiated and outflows are supposed to be dynamically unimportant. This is now called ``Standard and Normal Evolution'' or SANE accretion \citep{curd22a}. 

When the mass supply rate is either much smaller or much larger than this, it is commonly argued that the accretion is radiatively inefficient close to the black hole and $\epsilon \ll 1$. For a low mass supply rate, it is supposed that a thick, ion pressure-supported torus forms. The ions are accompanied by much cooler electrons which have to maintain a near-Maxwellian distribution function at $\sim0.1$ of the ion temperature, despite being collisionless and in the presence of plasma turbulence. When the mass supply rate is large, the gas becomes radiation-dominated and the inefficiency follows from photon trapping. In either case, the torus' funnel supposedly traps magnetic flux in what is now called a ``Magnetically Arrested Disk'' or MAD state \citep[][and references therein]{narayan22}. If the black hole is spinning fast, a significant amount of flux threads the event horizon and two electromagnetically-powered jets are formed. As the gas flow is essentially conservative, it was, traditionally, supposed to pass through a cusp, located in the equatorial plane between the marginally stable and marginally bound orbits, before plunging, invisibly, into the horizon\footnote{More recent, MAD simulations exhibit a strong toroidal current sheet \citep{parfrey19,ripperda22}. The continued avoidance of reconnection, particle acceleration and efficient radiative emission in this current sheet is problematic.}. 

Under these circumstances, jet formation has been seen, implicitly, as a consequence of accretion with jet power efficiency $L_{\rm jet}=k\dot Mc^2$ with $k$ variously estimated to increase from $\sim0.3$ to $\sim2$ --- we adopt $k=1$ --- as the angular frequency of the black hole, $\Omega_{\rm H}$, increases from $\sim0.5\Omega_{\rm max}$ to $\Omega_{\rm max}\equiv c^3/2GM$ \citep{tchekhovskoy11}. A near-maximally rotating black hole will put roughly ten times as much power into the jets as would have been released by the accreted gas in a steady, radiatively efficient disk flow and much more than is released in a radiatively inefficient flow. On the other hand, the jet production efficiency estimated for a small sample of CSOs does not seem to reach the highest efficiency levels \citep{2020ApJ...892..116W}.

This view has been developed with the aid of powerful, general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic and particle-in-cell simulations  \citep{tchekhovskoy11, parfrey19, 2020ARA&A..58..407D}. They usually derive from initial conditions with mass and magnetic flux orbiting the black hole \citep{narayan22}. These simulations frequently exhibit winds, driven by radiation pressure, gas pressure or magnetic field, though most of the mass supplied passes through the torus to the black hole. After settling down to a quasi-steady state the disk can also exhibit local dynamo action, so that the polarity of the magnetic field threading the horizon alternates relatively rapidly \citep{2011ApJ...730...94S}. These field reversals are thought to occur on many radial scales with clear, observational implications for the jets.

\subsubsection{Outflow Models}
%Spin-Powered Ergomagnetosphere and Ejection Disk or Hole-Energized, Magnetically-Mediated Ejection Disk state!!
An alternative model of the gas flow is suggested by the EHT observations of M87 \citep{EHT19}. In its most extreme form, when the black hole is near-maximally rotating, most of the gas supplied to the outer disk is carried off by a hydromagnetic wind \citep{blandford22}. The power for driving this wind comes primarily from the spin of the black hole, not the release of gravitational energy by infalling gas\footnote{If the black hole rotational energy is not tapped, it is still energetically possible for most of the mass supplied at large radius to escape to freedom in a wind, from intermediate radius \citep{blandford99}. This can be powered, gravitationally, by a small fraction of the supplied mass, that makes it to the ISCO, and which, altruistically, sacrifices itself for this purpose. However, this arrangement is unlikely to form powerful jets and is not of interest for CSOs.}. 

In the outflow model, it is conjectured that the black hole is immersed in an ergomagnetosphere with very little gas present and that electromagnetic energy is transported radially outward from the hole, through a small scale (a ``clutch'')  or large scale (a ``capstan'') electromagnetic field, connecting the horizon to the disk, as well as parallel to the spin axis to form the jets \citep{blandford22}. The magnetic flux passes through the equatorial plane, even close to the horizon, without forming a dissipative current sheet. It is ``hemmed in'', not by the pressure of hot gas orbiting in a thick torus, as in the inflow model, but by the inertia of cold gas orbiting in a thin disk and the vertical magnetic field threading the disk, strong enough to suppress the magnetorotational instability (MRI) \citep{blandford22}. Stresses applied to this vertical field below the Alfv\'en point are communicated to the disk. The transition from magnetic to inertial dominance happens at a radius $r_{\rm ring}$, and the mass of orbiting gas in this region is $m_{\rm ring}$. Presumably, $r_{\rm ring}$ and $m_{\rm ring}$ increase with $\Omega_{\rm H}$. Rotation power is unimportant below some intermediate value of $\Omega_{\rm H}$.

Within the ring, the strength of the poloidal magnetic field must be roughly constant. Outside the ring, the magnetic field strength declines with radius, in such a way as to maintain the magnetocentrifugal wind, although the total flux threading the disk resides mostly at large radius. This wind is then responsible for the jet collimation, extending far along the jet and interacting with its surface.  Under these circumstances, the jet power should be bounded above by $\sim (\Omega_{\rm H}/2\pi\Omega_{\rm max})^2(GM/r_{\rm ring}c^2)^{-4}(m_{\rm ring}/M)$ times the gravitational power $c^5/G\sim3\times10^{52}\,{\rm W}$, with $\Omega_{\rm max}=c^3/2GM$. This allows the jet power to be much larger than ever observed, in principle. 

However, it is unreasonable to expect the gas to remain in the ring forever. Either an interchange-like instability will allow it to accrete onto the black hole, as in the inflow model, or magnetic stress will expel it as the innermost part of a wind, as in the outflow model. If we suppose that the residence time of the gas in the ring is $N$ times the dynamical time at the ring, $t_{\rm  ring}=N(r_{\rm ring}^3/GM)^{1/2}$, then we can introduce the flow rate through the ring $\dot m_{\rm ring}=m_{\rm ring}/t_{\rm ring}$, to obtain $L_{\rm jet}\sim N(\Omega_{\rm H}/2\pi\Omega_{\rm max})^2(GM/r_{\rm ring}c^2)^{-5/2}\dot m_{\rm ring}c^2$, accommodating both models. What is important is that the total jet energy produced, under either idealization, can equal, and may even exceed, the rest mass energy of the gas supplied to the ring, provided the black hole rotates rapidly.

\subsection{Ignition Models}
\label{subsec:fueling}

\subsubsection{Tidal Disruption Events}

We consider two possible explanations for the sources of CSOs to account for the most energetic (Table 6) and the most luminous (Fig. \ref{plt:comp1vs2}(b) CSOs. The first is that the CSOs are associated with dormant black holes that spin at least modestly fast, $\Omega_{\rm H}\gtrsim0.5\Omega_{\rm max}$ and capture a single star. We introduced this model in section \ref{sec:TDEs} \citep{1988Natur.333..523R,2021AandARv..29....3O}, and elaborate here on the plausibility of this model on physical grounds. The maximum CSO energies measured so far, $\sim 7\,{\rm M}_\odot c^2$, can be accommodated by a single stellar capture under either the inflow or the outflow models. When $\Omega_{\rm H}$ is large, the Lense-Thirring precession of the orbits of the debris will lead to the presence of infalling gas from many directions which, under the outflow model, is conducive to the formation of a collimated jet. Less energetic CSOs are easily explained with lower $\Omega_{\rm H}$ or partial tidal stripping.   

%The inferred durations of CSOs raise a larger though not insurmountable challenge. Tidal disruption events are generally observed to decline with timescales no more than a few years \citep{2021AARv..29....3O, vanVelzen2021, Subrayan2023}, incommensurate with the CSO lifetimes $\sim10^3$\,yr. However, as we have argued in \S\,\ref{sec:TDEs}, large SMBHs such as those consistent with the CSO host galaxy properties discussed in \S\,\ref{sec:hostgalaxy} can accomplish this and observational selection may prevent the recognition of less luminous events with longer decays. 
Models of TDEs generally suppose that stars are ripped apart on relativistic parabolic orbits and that the bound debris returns to the black hole and eventually settles into a disk at a rate $\dot M$. As previously discussed, the simplest dynamical models of this give $\dot M\propto (t/t_0)^{-5/3}$ \citep{ 1989IAUS..136..543P}, though simulations show a richer pattern of outcomes \citep{Bonnerot2020, 2021MNRAS.507.3207C}. For the inflow model, we expect the amount of mass that falls in after time $t$, will decrease $\propto t^{-2/3}$. Less than about $10^{-5} M_* $ will be available to power a CSO 2.0 after $\sim 1000\,{\rm yr}$ which seems inadequate. However, for the outflow model, mass may be cycled, through a magnetocentrifugal wind \citep{blandford82}, many times to large radius without becoming unbound so that it will fall back again. This can prolong the timescale over which a jet can be powered.

If TDEs operating under the outflow scenario are responsible for most CSOs, then it is reasonable to expect that CSOs should be accompanied by disk luminosity corresponding to a net inflow $\dot{M}\sim10^{-3}\,{\rm M}_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$ or total disk luminosity $\lesssim10^{43}\,{\rm erg\,s}^{-1}$. In addition, the central black holes should be rapidly spinning, as might be made apparent by X-ray spectroscopy of fluorescent iron lines.

More generally, many new observational capabilities are coming online and much should be learned about TDEs, reconciling radio, optical and X-ray perspectives. This will provide a better framework in which to interpret our, no less rapidly, developing understanding of CSOs. This includes the possibility that we will be able to rule out the TDE model.

\subsubsection{Disk Instabilities}

An alternative model for CSOs\footnote{As with supernovae and Gamma Ray Bursts, it would not be a surprise if the full class of CSOs involved quite different physical explanations.} supposes that the disk is thin and accretes gas at a modest rate. The outer disk may evolve to a state of instability, possibly thermal \citep{czerny09}, similar to what is observed in dwarf novae \citep{1984AcA....34..161S, 1996PASP..108...39O}. Such an instability induces a sudden transition to a high-torque state when the mass inflow increases by several orders of magnitude. For example, if the steady rate of inflow is $\dot{M}\sim10^{-5}\,{\rm M}_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$, and it increases by a hundred at a radius $\sim10^{17}\,{\rm cm}$, where there is $\sim1\,{\rm M}_\odot$ of gas, then it might be possible to account the higher level of jet power needed to account for a CSO\footnote{If this model were also to explain some TDEs the leading edge of the inflow would have to steepen to form a front and not diffuse.}. 

This model might be challenged to account for the apparent upper cutoff in the CSO energies and the lack of evidence for recurrence. Again, disk emission might be expected. 

\subsection{Propagation into External Media}

\subsubsection{Early Life Expansion}\label{sec:propagation}

Once the jets of a CSO~2 have been launched, they propagate into the external medium in much the same manner as that of a typical FR II source. We suppose that in this stage---corresponding with the CSO~2.0 phase---the actively-launched jet collides with the external medium and shocks form at its head.  At these shocked regions, the hot spots, like those apparent in J1035+5628 in Fig.~\ref{plt:cygnusA}, form due to particle heating of the jetted material in the shocked regions, which simultaneously amplifies magnetic fields and synchrotron emission \citep{Begelman1984, 2019ARAandA..57..467B}. At the site of this hot spot, the jetted material becomes redirected upstream and inflates a cocoon bounding the jet. This cocoon will also emit synchrotron radiation and should produce the less bright radio emission surrounding the hot spots \citep{Begelman1984}.

Directing relativistic outflows out to distances $\gtrsim$ 10 pc, as seen in CSOs and indeed larger double radio sources, requires a large-scale collimation mechanism. Explanations of this collimation involve pure gas pressure from either the cocoon or the ambient medium \citep[e.g.]{2011ApJ...740..100B, 2018MNRAS.477.2128H}, or large scale magnetic fields \citep[e.g]{2009ApJ...698.1570L, 2011PhRvE..83a6302L}. In the former scenario, the ambient pressure directly balances the component of the jet ram pressure projected perpendicular to the jet axis \citep{2011ApJ...738..148M}. A strong collimation shock forms at the site of the pressure balance, and redirects the jetted material along the jet axis. In magnetized jets, the hoop stress of the magnetic field assists in collimation. While these two models do not give significantly different phenomenological description of jets (i.e., that the jet propagates into the external medium, inflates a cocoon to pressure confine the jet), the additional magnetic pressure  can require lower external gas pressure for collimation \citep{2014MNRAS.443.1532B}. Distinguishing between these models should be achievable observationally.


 Luminous thermal X-rays surrounding the jet represent one potential probe. Since in a gas-collimated jet the thermal pressure of the external medium must balance the pressure in the jet $p_j$, we expect
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pressurebalance}
    \frac{1}{3}\frac{U_{\rm tot,eq}}{V}=n_a k_B T_a,
\end{equation}
where $U_{\rm tot,eq}$ is once again the equipartition energy of the CSOs, $V$ is the volume of the emitting region, $n_a$ is the number density of the ambient gas, $k_B$ is Boltzamann's constant, and $T_a$ is the external temperature. In Eq.~\ref{eq:pressurebalance} for pressure balance, we have assumed that the CSO jet pressure is one third the average equipartition energy density. With an ambient gas temperature of $T=10^7$ K, we estimate the external particle density and consequently the luminosity of its thermal emission \citep[e.g., ][]{Rybicki1985}. We show the anticipated thermal X-ray luminosities for CSO~2.0s in Fig. \ref{plt:CSO2.0expectedx-rays}.
We expect gas-pressure-collimated CSO~2.0s to have X-ray luminosities in excess of $\sim10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$.  X-ray emission in excess of this threshold (although with low spatial resolution) has already been observed among some CSO~2s \citep{2007A&A...476..759B, 2016ApJ...823...57S, 2020ApJ...897..164K}, giving credence to the gas-pressure-collimated hypothesis. However, inverse-Compton emission originating in jets \citep{2008ApJ...680..911S,2022ApJ...941...52S} and thermal X-rays from the accretion disk \citep{1999PASP..111....1K,2018MNRAS.480.1247K,2022ApJ...941...52S} may also account for an X-ray excess. Although difficult, the resolution of X-ray emission from nearby CSOs at sub-kpc scales of the core could help distinguish these origins. 

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\columnwidth]{CSO2.0_XrayEstimates.png}
    \caption{The expected thermal X-ray luminosities of the bona fide CSO~2.0s if collimated by gas-pressure.}
    \label{plt:CSO2.0expectedx-rays}
\end{figure}

Simultaneously, constraints on magnetized jets may come from additional radio polarization measurements as well as improved radio spectra. The stronger and more orderly magnetic fields in this model should induce greater degrees of magnetic polarization. Another difference between the gas pressure dominated and magnetized models lies in the advance speed of the jet head. The heads of Poynting flux-dominated jets are predicted to propagate at relativistic speeds, notably faster than their totally gas-pressure-collimated counterparts, as the lack of collimation shocks near the base of the jets does not slow the jets down \citep{2014MNRAS.443.1532B}. The subrelativisitic advance speeds observed in CSO~2.0s makes this globally magnetized jet scenario unlikely.  Further measurements of the speeds of advance of CSOs can constrain this model considerably. Nevertheless, these jets could still be strongly magnetized at small scales with instabilities dissipating larger scale magnetic fields, giving way to a principally cocoon gas-pressure-collimated jet at those scales \citep{2013ApJ...764..148L}. In such cases, standing transverse magnetosonic oscillations in the jet on pc scales \citep{2009ApJ...698.1570L, 2017MNRAS.465.1608L} or significant rotation measures \citep[e.g.][]{2009ApJ...694.1485K} may give credence to this model. 


\subsubsection{Late Life Rise}

Motivated by the morphological structure previously described, we suppose that the transition that separates CSO~2.0s from CSO~2.2s occurs when jet fueling either severely weakens or terminates completely. While the intermediate stage between these two states remains obscure, due to the ambiguous nature of the CSO~2.1 class, we believe it possible that after a period of jet activity, the CSO jet shuts off (possibly due to one of the models considered in \S\,\ref{subsec:fueling}), and the remaining downstream material in the cocoon begins to rise convectively as a turbulent plume. In this model, the rising plume phase represents the CSO~2.2 state. 


Before discussing the consequences of the rising plume model, we first briefly consider our motivation for interpreting late-life CSOs as lacking active jets. Without active jets, they should emit less radio synchrotron emission as there is no longer a continuously supplied stream of energetic particles flowing from the core. Additionally, we also expect less X-ray emission than early life CSOs as the material in the radio emitting lobes will be less energetic, and no longer require the strong collimation needed in the CSO~2.0 case. Objects we classify as CSO~2.0s represent twice as many X-ray sources as those we classify as CSO~2.2s in recent observations \citep{2020ApJ...897..164K}. With both lower radio luminosities and even fewer X-ray detections than CSO~2.0s, we suppose that the radio lobes of late-life CSO~2.2s may rise as plumes rather than through strong jet power.

A turbulent plume rises buoyantly as long as the density inside the plume remains less than the density of the ambient medium. This occurs subsonically as the plume both collides with the external medium at its head and entrains ambient material without forming a strong shock. If the ambient medium is convectively stable, i.e., the ambient density decreases with height, the plume will reach a terminal height, at which point it begins to spread horizontally \citep{1956RSPSA.234....1M} and produces the characteristic mushroom cloud shape observed in volcanic plumes \citep{2010AnRFM..42..391W}. In fact, \cite{1956RSPSA.234....1M} showed that a plume rising in any convectively stable ambient medium will reach a maximum height and begin to spread horizontally. 

This picture can explain the observed behavior of CSO~2.2s, whose outward-advancing speeds are negligible and which exhibit sizable features orthogonal to the jet direction. Consider an ambient density profile of $\rho_a=\rho_0\left(\zeta_0/\zeta\right)^a$, where $\zeta$ is the distance from the center of the AGN. We may estimate the change in height of the buoyant plume $\Delta \zeta$ by the scale height of the ambient medium 
\begin{equation}
    \Delta \zeta\sim \left[\rho_a\left\vert\frac{d \rho_a}{d\zeta}\right\vert^{-1}\right]_{\zeta_0}=\frac{\zeta_0}{a},  
\end{equation}
where $\zeta_0$ is the height at which the plume begins to rise. $\zeta_0$ may represent the height reached by the active CSO~2.0, so the maximum height achieved by the buoyant inactive CSO~2.2 will be $\zeta_\textrm{max}=\zeta_0+\Delta \zeta$. Therefore, the maximum size of a CSO should be 
\begin{equation}
D_{\textrm{max}}=\left(1+\frac{1}{a}\right)D_0,
\end{equation}
where $D_\textrm{max}=2\zeta_\textrm{max}$ and $D_0=2\zeta_0$ (since total CSO size contains both lobes). Setting $D_0$ as the median CSO~2.0 size $166$ pc and using a fiducial value for $a$ of 2 \citep{2022ApJ...928....7W}, we obtain an expected median size of CSO~2.2s of 249 pc, about a 30\% difference from the observed median size of 346 pc. A less steep profile of $a=1$ \citep{2015MNRAS.453..775G} gives an expected median size of CSO~2.2s of 332 pc, nearly an exact match to the observed median size. (On much longer timescales, it is possible that these plumes might evolve to very faint bubbles, analogous to those seen in rich clusters of galaxies.) Consequently, this simple model comports with observed CSO properties.


\section{Discussion}\label{sec:discussion}

We believe that with these three papers we have made a compelling case that CSOs can play a crucial role in multiband AGN studies,  elucidating the launching and propagation of relativistic jets, the central engines that drive AGN, and the environments of SMBHs in the nuclei of galaxies.

We therefore now consider the number of CSOs that are amenable to study with existing radio instruments. We then look at the potential for CSO studies with  planned radio instruments -- in  particular the DSA2000 and ngVLA. As was pointed out in \S \ref{sec:tip}, we have, thus far, focused on the brightest CSOs. It is, therefore, important first to assess the potential for observing fainter CSOs with existing facilities.

In addition to the radio studies discussed below to determine the structure and structural variations  in CSOs, the full exploitation of CSOs will require intensive multi-band studies at higher frequencies, including submm-IR-optical-X-ray and gammas-ray studies. There will, no doubt, be a wealth of information from such studies, in addition to the determination of the masses of the host galaxies and SMBHs, as described in \S 
\ref{sec:hostgalaxy}, and the characterization of the confining medium, as described in \S \ref{sec:propagation}.


\subsection{The Numbers of CSOs Amenable to Study with Existing and Planned Instruments}\label{sec:Amenable}

With its flux density cutoff of S$_{\rm 5GHz}\geq 85 $ mJy, VIPS provides the deepest CSO VLBI survey to date.
 From Table 2 of Paper 1 we see that there are 33, 48 and 268 bona fide CSOs, Class A candidates, and Class B candidates, respectively, in  the VIPS survey. However VIPS excluded steep spectrum $(\alpha < -0.5$) objects, and these must be added to the VIPS survey to make it complete in spectral index. We now estimate the numbers of steep spectrum CSOs and CSO candidates expected in the steep spectrum counterpart to the VIPS survey.

Of the 18 bona fide CSOs in the PR+CJ1+PW samples, seven have $\alpha_{\rm 2.7 GHz}^{\rm 5 GHz} < -0.5$, and so would have been excluded by the VIPS spectral index filter $(\alpha \geq -0.5)$. If we assume that the relative numbers found in the PR+CJ1+PW sample down to flux density $S_{\rm 5\, GHz}= 700$ mJy persist down to $S_{\rm 5\, GHz}= 85$ mJy, then there will be $\sim 54,\, \sim 79,\, {\rm and}\, \sim 439$ bona fide CSOs, Class A candidates, and Class B candidates, respectively, in the spectral index complete sample of VIPS flat+steep spectrum sources. Note that 24\% of the VIPS objects are unresolved point sources, which could well be resolved with higher resolution and higher sensitivity VLBI observations. Thus the above numbers are conservative.

The VIPS survey area covers 8,000 square degrees \citep{2007ApJ...658..203H}, i.e., $\sim$ one fifth of the sky. Thus, over the whole sky, the numbers of expected bona fide CSOs, A class candidate CSOs, and B class candidate CSOs are 270, 393, and 2193, respectively.

It seems highly likely, therefore, that the number of CSOs that can be studied with existing instruments, over the whole sky and down to $S_{\rm 5\, GHz}= 85$ mJy,  is between $\sim 300$ and $\sim 1000$.  This is a large enough sample that it can be subdivided into various sub-samples, each amenable to robust statistical tests.

In addition to surveys such as the extended complete VIPS flat+steep spectrum survey, it is entirely possible, with existing facilities, to carry out deeper observations in order to ``drill down'' samples of CSOs down to S$_{\rm 5\, GHz} \sim 30$ mJy, or lower, in order to study the low-luminosity population of CSOs.

We conclude that there is no shortage of  CSOs accessible with existing facilities.

\subsection{Resolution, Sensitivity and Dynamic Range }\label{sec:dimensions}

In addition to the numbers of CSOs that can be studied in the manner already demonstrated by the VIPS survey discussed in the previous section, another powerful aspect of CSO studies is that it is relatively straightforward to augment these studies by increasing the resolution and sensitivity.  We can increase the resolution by going to higher frequencies (45 GHz and 90 GHz), which would require an increase in sensitivity using global VLBI arrays that incorporate large antennas, such as the Green Bank Telescope, the Effelsberg Telescope, Deep Space Network Telescopes, the LMT, and a variety of other large telescopes, most of which can operate to 43 GHz, and some of which can operate to 90 GHz.  

While the use of global VLBI arrays will somewhat increase the dynamic range of the images, it would be possible to improve the sensitivity, resolution, and dynamic range of CSO images dramatically by including the ngVLA, as we discuss after the next two sections.

\subsection{VLASS CSO Finding Surveys}\label{sec:finding}

The Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS)  will provide the ideal CSO search surveys north of declination $\delta = -40^\circ$ \citep{2020PASP..132c5001L}, and, as discussed in \S 4.2.3 of Paper 2, we have already begun using it for this purpose. The 2.5 arc second resolution of the VLASS enables  down-selection to the unresolved sources, and the frequency coverage of 2 -- 4 GHz is ideal. The sensitivity of the VLASS is such that it should be possible to search for all the CSOs in a given area of the sky north of $\delta = -40^\circ$ down to 1 mJy, which would likely include many thousands of CSOs.  The 3 VLASS epochs, separated by 32 months will provide the ideal cadence to filter out the rapidly varying AGN and other compact variables, leaving a large sample of low-variability, compact objects. Optical identification selecting for galaxies can further narrow the search for CSOs.

These CSO surveys will then be followed up with existing VLBI arrays for the birghter candidates and the ngVLA for the fainter candidates.

\subsection{CSO Observations with the DSA2000}\label{sec:dsa}

The DSA2000 \citep{2019BAAS...51g.255H} will be a powerful CSO candidate search instrument.  The frequency coverage of 0.7-2.0 GHz  and 4 month cadence over 16 epochs will provide an ideal complement to the VLASS. The sensitivity of 2 $\mu$Jy/beam at each epoch would enable very sensitive monitoring of variability of CSOs down to 1 mJy in total flux density, or deeper if necessary. As with the VLASS,  selection of the unresolved ($<3.5$ arcseconds), unvarying or slowly varying, sources, will filter out the CSO candidates from the large numbers of blazars that dominate the compact extragalactic  radio sky.  As with the VLASS, the potential CSO candidates will then be followed up with VLBI using existing VLBI arrays for the brighter candidates and eventually by the ngVLA for the fainter candidates.


\subsection{CSO Observations with the ngVLA}\label{sec:ngvla}

The ngVLA will be much more sensitive than the VLBA, since the system equivalent flux density (SEFD)   should be considerably better than the VLBA because the apertures are unblocked, the system temperatures will be lower, and the ground spillover will be lower. In addition, there will be three ngVLA antennas per site, and the bandwidth is much larger than the VLBA.  For example,  all of the 3.5 -- 12.3 GHz band will be covered simultaneously. The ngVLA sensitivity in different bands is given in  \url{https://ngvla.nrao.edu/page/performance}.  The ultimate sensitivity will depend on how much of the inner array is used, but if using all of it, the nominal sensitivity in 1 hour for 1 mas resolution will be 3.2 $\mu$Jy/beam.  

It is clear, therefore, that the ngVLA will be able to provide much higher sensitivity and dynamic range maps of CSOs than is  possible with existing facilities, extending up to 90 GHz.




\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

We have examined a carefully-selected sample of 54~bona fide CSOs for which we have spectroscopic redshifts. We have defined three new morphological classes of CSOs: CSO~2.0, CSO~2.1, and CSO~2.2.  We have classified the 54~CSOs in our sample into these three CSO~2 classes and the CSO~1 class, using blind tests.  

We find it remarkable that, 
 in spite of the very wide variety of morphologies displayed by CSOs, it is possible to classify them into just four morphological classes. We also find the agreement in our blind tests remarkable.

 The resulting classifications of CSO~2s, and their different positions in the $(P,D)$ plane can be explained on the simple hypothesis that there is an evolutionary sequence ${\rm CSO} \;2.0 \rightarrow {\rm CSO}\; 2.1 \rightarrow {\rm CSO} \;2.2$, with CSO~2.0s being ``early-life'' CSOs, CSO~2.1s being ``mid-life'' CSOs,  and CSO~2.2s being ``late-life'' CSOs.  
 
 Such an evolutionary sequence provides an explanation for the size cutoff of CSOs that was found in Paper~2, and is consistent with all that is known about the phenomenology of CSOs. The theory could be tested by carrying out a systematic study of the speeds of advance of CSO~2.2s compared to those of CSO~2.0s and also by looking for systematic differences in ages between these two classes as revealed by spectral breaks.
 
 The origins of CSOs and the reasons for their relatively short lives as jetted-AGN will be the subjects of continuing studies. At this stage, none of the possibilities we have considered for ignition, including tidal disruption events and MHD instabilities in the accretion disk, and for the extraction of the spin energy of the SMBH can be definitively ruled out.  It is entirely possible that multiple mechanisms play a role in CSOs and that CSOs constitute not so much a ``class'' but more like a ``family'' of AGN that, while as yet relatively unexplored, has the potential for studying AGN and relativistic jets that will lead well beyond what we can imagine at this stage.

 All of these considerations make it clear to us that CSOs provide a unique and  vastly under-unexploited window into  the study of SMBHs, their accretion disks, and the birth of relativistic jets. This amounts to a new, and compelling, science driver for both the DSA2000 and the ngVLA. The multi-epoch DSA2000 surveys will have the sensitivity to dig down to very low luminosity to provide samples of weak CSOs.  The ngVLA, operating up to 90 GHz in conjunction with the existing global VLBI network, where needed, will provide studies of CSOs that could revolutionize the study of AGN and, by extension, other sources known to form relativistic jets such as X-ray binaries, Gamma Ray Bursts and pulsars. These include the creation, launching and fuelling of relativistic jets, and, most importantly,  whether the existing paradigm for the fuelling of relativistic jets, via accretion, is always correct, or whether their energy can derive from the spin of the black hole.

\section{Individual Classification Notes \\
for the 54~bona fide CSOs that have spectroscopic redshifts}\label{sec:notes}

Numbers in [square] brackets are those assigned to the objects in \cref{plt:linsizedist},  \cref{tab:bonafides}, and \cref{tab:bonafides2}.
Dagger$^\dagger$ indicates the reference to the map displayed in \cref{plt:linsizedist}.



\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J0029+3456, CSO~2.0 [12]: Maps at 5\,GHz \citep{2000ApJS..131...95F}$^\dagger$ and 15\,GHz (MOJAVE stacked epoch) show clear hot spots at the opposite outer edges of the lobes.
\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J0111+3906,  CSO~2.0 [3]:  \citet{1996ApJ...463...95T}$^\dagger$, using multi-frequency, multi-epoch observations, pinpointed the flat-spectrum center of activity - marked by the red cross in \cref{plt:linsizedist}[3], and provided compelling evidence of steep-spectrum hot spots situated at the outer edges of the lobes straddling the nucleus. This was the first CSO to be shown to have some faint large-scale structure, and thus to have had previous activity, which established the existence of multiple epochs of activity in some CSOs \citep{1990AA...232...19B}.
\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J0119+3210,  CSO~2.2 [35]: The 5\,GHz map by \citet{2003AandA...399..889G}$^\dagger$ shows weak hot spots in a highly resolved lobes perpendicular to the source axis.   \vskip 6pt
\noindent
J0131+5545, CSO~2.2 [41]: The stacked epoch MOJAVE$^\dagger$ image shows two highly resolved, edge-brightened lobes with no hot spots,
\citep{2020ApJ...899..141L}, making this is a CSO~2.2 object.  \citet{2020ApJ...899..141L} interpret this and the emission gap between the lobes and bright inner jet as evidence of two separate epochs of activity in this object, which may be correct, but since compact components are seen along the jets of many CSO 2s, and since we interpret the structure as showing two such compact components (see \S \ref{sec:J0131}, and Fig.~\ref{plt:sixmaps} (e)), we assume here that this is a normal CSO and not an object displaying two separate epochs of acitvity.
\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J0405+3803, CSO~2.0 [53]: The multifrequency  observations of \citet{2004ApJ...602..123M}$^\dagger$ show clearly that there are hot spots at the outer extremities of the inner lobe structure.   In addition, as these authors show, there are two active nuclei in this object, so this is also a rare example of a binary supermassive black hole (SMBH). This  CSO  exhibits more than one epoch of activity \citep{2004ApJ...602..123M}.
\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J0713+4349, CSO~2.0 [10]: \citet{1984IAUS..110..131R} showed that this object has a flat spectrum core, a steep spectrum jet, and two steep spectrum lobes. \citet{1996ApJ...463...95T} pinpointed the center of activity and showed that there are hot spots at the extremities of the lobes. The image shown is a MOJAVE$^\dagger$ stacked image.
\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J0741+2706, CSO~2.1 [8]: \citet{2016MNRAS.459..820T}$^\dagger$ observed this object at 5\,GHz and 8\,GHz, and identified the flat spectrum core and two steep spectrum lobes.  The object is edge-dimmed - i.e., the regions of highest surface brightness outside of the core are closer to the core than to the outer edges of the lobes.  There are no clear hot spots. The blind tests were split equally between a 2.1 and a 2.2.  This shows that the classification is indeterminate, and hence this is a CSO~2.1 object.
\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J0825+3919, CSO~2.1 [18]:  In view of the absence of dominant hot spots at the outer edges of the lobes \citep{2004AandA...426..463O}$^\dagger$, we classify this as a CSO~2.1. 
\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J0832+1832, CSO~1.0 [54]: Like J0741+2706, \citet{2016MNRAS.459..820T}$^\dagger$ observed this object at 5\,GHz and 8\,GHz, and identified the flat spectrum core and two steep spectrum lobes.  The object is edge-dimmed - i.e., the regions of highest surface brightness outside of the core are closer to the core than to the outer edges of the lobes.  There are no clear hot spots. The edge-dimmed morphology makes this a CSO~1  object.
\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J0855+5751, CSO~2.1 [39]: \citet{2005ApJS..159...27T}, in pilot VIPS 5\,GHz observations, identified this object as a CSO based on the morphology of the two lobes and the hot spots in the lobes. \citet{2016MNRAS.462.2819B}$^\dagger$ re-reduced the data and their map makes clear that the northern hot-spot is at the outer extremity of the lobe, whereas  the southern hot-spot is not at the outer extremity of the lobe.  This discrepancy in the morphologies of the two lobes leads to the classification as ``intermediate'', or CSO~2.1.
\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J0906+4124, CSO~1 [46]: The EVN images at 5\,GHz and 8\,GHz by \citet{2021MNRAS.506.1609C}$^\dagger$ show a flat-spectrum core flanked  by two oppositely directed edge-dimmed jets in this low-luminosity CSO~1 object.
\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J0909+1928, CSO~1 [44]: The VLBA image at 8.4\,GHz by \citet{2018ApJ...863..155C}$^\dagger$ shows a strong core flanked  by two oppositely directed edge-dimmed jets in this low-luminosity CSO~1 object.
\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J0943+1702, CSO~2.0 [9]: \citet{2016MNRAS.459..820T} identified this as a CSO based on 5\,GHz and 8\,GHz observations, which showed a clear flat-spectrum core and two steep spectrum lobes. The lobes are barely resolved in  the \citet{2016MNRAS.459..820T} maps, but the MOJAVE$^\dagger$ 15\,GHz observations show clear hot spots at the outer edges of the lobes, making this a clear CSO~2.0 object. This is one of only three CSOs whose classification was revised after the blind tests\ddag. The CSO~2.0 classification was agreed unanimously in a group discussion of how the MOJAVE image was embedded in the 5\,GHz image and the positions of the 15\,GHz hot spots at the outer edges of the 5\,GHz lobes.

\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J1025+1022, CSO~1 [40]: The VLBA image at 8.4\,GHz by \citet{2018ApJ...863..155C}$^\dagger$ shows a strong core flanked  by two oppositely directed edge-dimmed jets in this low-luminosity CSO~1 object.
\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J1035+5628, CSO~2.0 [11]: \citet{1996ApJ...463...95T} made 8.4\,GHz and 15\,GHz observations of this Pearson-Readhead \citep{1988ApJ...328..114P} CSO  and identified its flat spectrum core and two leading-edge brightened lobes, which are seen clearly in the MOJAVE$^\dagger$ 15\,GHz image.
\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J1111+1955, CSO~2.0 [1]: The 8.4\,GHz image of \citep{2000ApJ...534...90P}$^\dagger$ shows clear hot spots at the outer edges of the two lobes. \citet{2005ApJ...622..136G} confirmed this as a CSO based on the steep spectra of the edge-brightened outer lobes.
\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J1120+1420, CSO~2.0 [21]: \citet{1998MNRAS.297..559B}$^\dagger$ identified this as a CSO based on 23\,GHz MERLIN and 1.6\,GHz VLBA observations.  In the Radio Fundamental Catalog\footnote{http://astrogeo.org/rfc/} (RFC) maps, this object has clear hot spots at the outer edges of the lobes, making this a CSO~2.0 object.
\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J1148+5924, CSO~1 [42]: The \citet{2016MNRAS.459..820T} 5\,GHz and 8\,GHz maps show this to be an edge-dimmed object, as is also seen in the MOJAVE$^\dagger$ image.  The morphology and low luminosity indicate this is a CSO~1 object. This object shows evidence of a previous epoch of activity.
\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J1158+2450, CSO~2.1 [32]: A very unusual object, as revealed in the 5\,GHz, 8\,GHz and 15\,GHz maps of \citet{2008ApJ...684..153T}$^\dagger$.  The 5\,GHz map shows an apparent east-west double source, but the 15\,GHz map shows that the eastern component has a north-south CSO embedded in the slightly larger east-west structure. The 8--15\,GHz spectral index map of \citet{2008ApJ...684..153T} clearly identifies the flat spectrum core and steep spectrum lobes in the north-south structure in the eastern component, making this a clear CSO~2.2.  This is one of only two CSOs whose classification was revised after the blind tests had been carried out\ddag.  The final CSO~2.2 classification was unanimously agreed in a group discussion of the \citet{2008ApJ...684..153T} 8\,GHz and 15\,GHz maps.
\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J1159+5820, CSO~2.0 [17]: The extended steep spectrum, edge-brightened by hot spots outer lobes revealed in the 5\,GHz and 8\,GHz images of \citet{2016MNRAS.459..820T}$^\dagger$ mark this objects as a CSO~2.0.
\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J1205+2031, CSO~2.1 [43]: The EVN images at 5\,GHz and 8\,GHz by \citet{2021MNRAS.506.1609C}$^\dagger$ show two resolved lobes in this low-luminosity CSO~2.1 object.
\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J1220+2916, CSO~1 [45]: This object is observed in the 5\,GHz and 8\,GHz observations of \citet{2016MNRAS.459..820T}$^\dagger$ to have a flat spectrum core, indicated by the red cross, and two edge-dimmed jets extending in opposite directions from the core.  The morphology and low luminosity mark this as a CSO~1 object.
\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J1227+3635, CSO~2.0 [16]: This object is observed in the 1.7\,GHz and 5\,GHz observations of \citet{2013MNRAS.433..147D}, as well as the 5\,GHz and 8\,GHz observations of \citet{2016MNRAS.459..820T}$^\dagger$ to have a flat spectrum core straddled by two steep spectrum lobes, one of which is at the end of a long, narrow jet and is strongly edge brightened. 
The optical identification is a quasar at redshift 1.973, which suggests that the jet axis cannot be close to the plane of the sky.  The most likely interpretation is that this is a CSO where some effects of relativistic beaming are being seen, which might also explain the fact that this is the highest luminosity CSO in this sample of 55.  The side opposite the jet on this interpretation is de-boosted and the hot-spot radiation on that side is likely also de-boosted.   The morphology of the very narrow jet and strong hot-spot on one side mark this as a CSO~2.0 object. 
\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J1234+4753, CSO~2.1 [34]: \citet{2016MNRAS.459..820T}$^\dagger$ show that this object has a flat ($\alpha \sim -0.5$ from  5 to 8\,GHz) to steep ($\alpha \sim -1.0$ from 8 to 15\,GHz) spectrum core and edge-dimmed CSO~1 morphology.  
\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J1244+4048, CSO~2.2 [19]: The \citet{2004AandA...426..463O}$^\dagger$ map shows a nucleus and two-sided edge-dimmed jet. The 5\,GHz and 8\,GHz images of  \citet{2016MNRAS.459..820T} show a flat spectrum core and two-sided steep spectrum jet with highly-resolved hot spots, indicative of a CSO~2.2.
\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J1247+6723, CSO~2.0 [50]: The 15\,GHz map of \citet{2003PASA...20...16M}$^\dagger$ shows hot spots towards the outer edges of the lobes, making this a CSO~2.0 object. This object is a clear double on larger scales, showing evidence of a previous epoch of activity.
\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J1254+1856, CSO~1 [48]: The 5\,GHz and 8\,GHz maps of \citet{2016MNRAS.459..820T} show a flat spectrum core with two fading, edge-dimmed steep spectrum jets.  The morphology and low luminosity clearly indicate a CSO~1. The MOJAVE$^\dagger$ image shows the same features.
\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J1311+1658, CSO~1 [38]: 5\,GHz and 8\,GHz observations of \citet{2016MNRAS.459..820T}$^\dagger$  show this object to have a flat spectrum core and two edge-dimmed steep spectrum jets. It  is therefore a CSO~1 object. 
\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J1313+5458, CSO~2.2 [20]: The 5\,GHz map of \citet{1994ApJS...95..345T}$^\dagger$ shows two heavily-resolved lobes. 5\,GHz and 8\,GHz observations of \citet{2016MNRAS.459..820T} shows these lobes to have steep spectra.  The  highest surface brightness region, possibly a hot-spot, in one lobe is not at the extremity of the source, and the other lobe has an amorphous structure with no hot-spot.
\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J1326+3154, CSO~2.2 [13]: The 5\,GHz map of \citet{2007ApJ...658..203H}$^\dagger$ shows two highly resolved lobes with hot spots at extremities of the lobes in some directions, but not the overall extremities of the source, making this a CSO~2.2 object.
\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J1347+1217, CSO~2.2 [28]: The 5\,GHz map of \citet{1997A&A...325..943S}$^\dagger$ hows a well-resolved lobe on one side, and a weak lobe on the other side of the presumed nucleus. This object shows evidence of a previous epoch of activity.
\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J1400+6210, CSO~2.2 [15]: \citet{1996ApJ...463...95T} pinpointed the center of activity in this object, which made clear that it is a CSO.   They also pointed out that, while there is a lot of structure in the jets, there are no visible hot spots. So this is a CSO~2.2 object.
\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J1407+2827, CSO~2.1 [52]: The strange morphology of this source, as shown in the MOJAVE$^\dagger$ image, makes this object difficult to classify - hence ``indeterminate'', i.e., CSO~2.1.
\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J1414+4554, CSO~2.1 [36]: The 5\,GHz map of \citet{2005ApJ...622..136G}$^\dagger$ shows an edge-brightened southern lobe with a resolved hot-spot, and an edge-dimmed northern lobe, making this an ``indeterminate'' CSO~2.1 object.

J1434+4236, CSO~2.2 [22]: 5\,GHz and 8\,GHz observations of \citet{2016MNRAS.459..820T}$^\dagger$  show this object to have two resolved lobes, each with well-resolved extensions perpendicular to the source axis.  Hence this is a CSO~2.2 object,
\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J1440+6108, CSO~2.2 [30]: 5\,GHz and 8\,GHz observations of \citet{2016MNRAS.459..820T}$^\dagger$  show this object to have two resolved lobes, each with well-resolved extensions perpendicular to the source axis.  Hence this is a CSO~2.2 object.
\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J1508+3423, CSO~2.1 [33]: The  5\,GHz MERLIN observations by  \citet{2010MNRAS.408.2261K}$^\dagger$ show a complex structure indicative of a CSO~2.1 object.
\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J1511+0518, CSO~2.0 [51]: The 22\,GHz image of \citet{2006AA...450..959O}$^\dagger$ shows slight edge-dimming in both lobes in this very compact source.  We have provisionally classified it as a CSO~2.0 because of its very compact, unresolved, structure at all frequencies, from 2.3\,GHz to 22\,GHz, including in the MOJAVE stacked image,  perpendicular to the axis, but further observations at higher frequencies are needed to confirm this.
\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J1559+5924, CSO~1 [47]: The MOJAVE$^\dagger$ and the 5\,GHz and 8\,GHz observations of \citet{2016MNRAS.459..820T} show this to be an edge-dimmed, low-luminosity CSO~1 object.
\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J1602+5243, CSO~1 [26]: The image of \citet{2009A&A...498..641D}$^\dagger$ shows two edge-dimmed jets and is clearly a CSO~1 object. 
\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J1609+2641, CSO~2.1 [14]: 5\,GHz and 8\,GHz observations of \citet{2016MNRAS.459..820T}$^\dagger$  show this object to have a hot-spot at the end of one lobe and the other lobe to be well-resolved with no hot-spot, making this an ``indeterminate'' CSO~2.1 object.
\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J1644+2536, CSO~2.1 [23]: 5\,GHz and 8\,GHz observations of \citet{2016MNRAS.459..820T}$^\dagger$  show this object to have a flat spectrum core flanked by two edge-dimmed jets, making this a CSO~2.1 object.
\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J1723-6500, CSO~2.1 [49]: The 8.4\,GHz image of \citet{2019AA...627A.148A}$^\dagger$ of this low-luminosity object shows a very curious. edge-dimmed structure, making this a CSO~2.1 object.
\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J1734+0926, CSO~2.0 [7]: As shown in the MOJAVE$^\dagger$ map, this is a double-lobed object with hot spots at the outer edges of the lobes, and hence this is a CSO~2.0 object.
\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J1735+5049, CSO~2.0 [4]: \citet{2014MNRAS.438..463O}$^\dagger$ carried out 6-frequency VLBA observations of this object, which revealed its flat-spectrum core, and steep-spectrum lobes with hot spots at the outer edges being self-absorbed below 6\,GHz. So this is clearly a CSO~2.0 object.
\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J1816+3457, CSO~2.1 [31]: The \citet{2005ApJ...622..136G}$^\dagger$ 8.4\,GHz map shows resolved lobes, edge-dimming in the southern lobe, and no hot-spot in the northern lobe. Hence the CSO~2.1 classification. Note that the image has been rotated to fit into the available space in Fig.~1, so that the southern lobe is the lobe at the upper right.
\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J1915+6548, CSO~2.1 [25]: As described by \citet{2007ApJ...661...78G}$^\dagger$, this is a very curious object, and is therefore of indeterminate class: CSO~2.1.
\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J1939-6342, CSO~2.0 [6]: As shown in this 8.4\,GHz image by \citet{2002A&A...392..841T}$^\dagger$, one of the lobes is unresolved at the outer edge, and the other is unresolved near the outer edge. Both lobes are unresolved perpendicular to the jet axis, making this a CSO~2.0 object.
\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J1944+5448, CSO~2.0 [29]: The 8.4\,GHz map of \citet{2016AN....337...42R}, and this MOJAVE$^\dagger$ image, both show the core and two outer lobes with hot spots at the outer edges, which make this a CSO~2.0 object.
\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J1945+7055, CSO~2.2 [37]: In the 8\,GHz map of this much-studied CSO \citet{1999ApJ...521..103P}, we see the core and two linear curving jets, the southern one culminating in a resolved component and the northern one having a hot-spot coincident with a sharp bend in the jet transitioning to a fainter component further out. Since this object shows edge-dimming at the end of the two oppositely-directed jets, as can be seen in this MOJAVE$^\dagger$ image, we classify it as a CSO~2.2 object.
\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J2022+6136, CSO~2.1 [2]: In this object one lobe is edge-brightened and the other is edge-dimmed -- hence the CSO~2.1 classification. This image is that of
\citet{2000ApJ...541...66L}$^\dagger$.
\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J2203+1007, CSO~2.0 [5]: The 15\,GHz image of \citet{2014MNRAS.438..463O}$^\dagger$ shows clear hot spots at the outer edges of the two lobes, making this a CSO~2.0 object.
\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J2327+0846, CSO~1 [27]: This highly unusual CSO was mapped at 1.4\,GHz by \citet{2003ApJ...597..809M}$^\dagger$, who showed that its age as a jetted-AGN is a few Myr. Note that the center of activity has been identified by \citet{2003ApJ...597..809M} with the highest surface brightness component,  This source shows strong edge-dimming and is therefore a CSO~1 object. 
\vskip 6pt
\noindent
J2355+4950, CSO~2.2 [24]: This object has been extensively studied as the archetypical CSO by R96, who showed that it has two extended lobes - the southern one with  a hot-spot at the outer edge of he lobe, and the northern one having no hot-spot. Although the southern lobe has a hot-spot, material is spilling out of this hot-spot towards the east.  In addition, at lower frequencies the structure extends outside of the jets and hot spots to form a common envelope.  The position of the flat-spectrum nucleus was pinpointed by \citet{1996ApJ...463...95T}.
R96 showed that there is a bright jet component in the  northern jet, and they also showed that the northern jet is an order of magnitude brighter than the southern jet.  This strongly suggests that the northern side is the approaching side and that we are seeing slightly beamed radiation from the two jets.  On this interpretation, the northern lobe is seen at a considerably later epoch than the southern lobe, which could explain the lack of a hot-spot in the northern lobe if the jet is no longer powering the hot-spot in the northern lobe. There is, therefore, a strong hint of evolution in the jets and lobes. These considerations plus that extended envelope and significant extension of the source normal to the jet axis lead us to classify this as a CSO~2.2 object.
The image shown is that of
\citet{1999NewAR..43..669O}$^\dagger$.

\section{Conclusion}
This paper has presented \sysname, a video prediction model that combines the advantages of keypoints and transformer models to achieve comparable accuracy performance with SOTA but with significantly less time and memory cost. TKN realizes real-time video prediction for the first time and opens the door for numerous futuristic applications demanding such capabilities. 
%
For future work, we plan to combine TKN with new AR applications and apply it to multi-person videos with higher resolutions.

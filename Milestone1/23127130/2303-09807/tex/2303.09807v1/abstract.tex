\begin{abstract}
Video prediction is a complex time-series forecasting task with great potential in many use cases. However, conventional methods overemphasize accuracy while ignoring the slow prediction speed caused by complicated model structures that learn too much redundant information with excessive GPU memory consumption. Furthermore, conventional methods mostly predict frames sequentially (frame-by-frame) and thus are hard to accelerate. Consequently, valuable use cases such as real-time danger prediction and warning cannot achieve fast enough inference speed to be applicable in reality.  %Conventional methods have been ignoring the slow prediction speed and excessive GPU consumption caused by complex structure employment and redundant information learning in the pursuit of high precision results. 
%In this paper, 
Therefore, we propose a transformer-based keypoint prediction neural network (\sysname), an unsupervised learning method that boost the prediction process via constrained information extraction and parallel prediction scheme. %\textcolor{red}{Comment 1 from Reviewer 2}. 
TKN is the first real-time video prediction solution to our best knowledge, while significantly reducing computation costs and maintaining other performance.   %nearly the same accuracy and quality of prediction as the state-of-the-art approaches.
%To our best knowledge, \sysname\ is the first real-time prediction solution. %\textcolor{blue}{\sysname\ outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of better keypoint capturing and image reconstruction in video prediction field.}  \textcolor{red}{Comment 5 from Reviewer 2} 
Extensive experiments on KTH and Human3.6 datasets demonstrate that \sysname\ predicts 11 times faster than existing methods while reducing memory consumption by 17.4\% and achieving state-of-the-art prediction performance on average. 
 %decreasing the processing delay by up to 295\%

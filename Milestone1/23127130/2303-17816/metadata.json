    "abstract": "We use a pump-probe, spin-, and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) with a 10.7 eV laser accessible up to the Brillouin zone edge, and reveal for the first time the entire band structure, including the unoccupied side, for the elemental bismuth (Bi) with the spin-polarized surface states. Our data identify Bi as in a strong topological insulator phase ($Z_2$=1) against the prediction of most band calculations. We unveil that the unoccupied topological surface states possess spin-polarized saddle points yielding the van Hove singularity, providing an excellent platform for the future development of opto-spintronics.",

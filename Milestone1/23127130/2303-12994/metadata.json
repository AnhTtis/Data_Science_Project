    "abstract": "In this paper, long time and high order moment asymptotics for super-Brownian motions (sBm's) are studied. By using a moment formula for sBm's (e.g. Theorem 3.1, Hu et al. Ann. Appl. Probab. 2023+), precise upper and lower bounds for all positive integer moments and for all time of sBm's for certain initial conditions are achieved. Then, the moment asymptotics as time goes to infinity or as the moment order goes to infinity follow immediately. Additionally, as an application of the two-sided moment bounds, the tail probability estimates of sBm's are obtained.",

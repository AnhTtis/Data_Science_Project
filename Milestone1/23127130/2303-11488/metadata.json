    "abstract": "In order to study electron-transfer mediated chemical processes on a metal surface, one requires not one but two potential energy surfaces (one ground state and one excited state) as in Marcus theory. In this letter, we report that a novel, dynamically-weighted, state-averaged constrained CASSCF(2,2) (DW-SA-cCASSCF(2,2)) can produce such surfaces for the Anderson Impurity model. Both ground and excited state potentials are smooth, they incorporate states with a charge transfer character, and the accuracy of the ground state surface can be verified for some model problems by renormalization group theory. Future development of gradients and nonadiabatic derivative couplings should allow for the study of non-adiabatic dynamics for molecules near metal surfaces.",

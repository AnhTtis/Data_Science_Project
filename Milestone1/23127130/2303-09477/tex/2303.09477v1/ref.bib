abstract = {We investigate the use of machine learning to create effective heuristics for search algorithms such as IDA⁎ or heuristic-search planners such as FF. Our method aims to generate a sequence of heuristics from a given weak heuristic h0 and a set of unsolved training instances using a bootstrapping procedure. The training instances that can be solved using h0 provide training examples for a learning algorithm that produces a heuristic h1 that is expected to be stronger than h0. If h0 is so weak that it cannot solve any of the given instances we use random walks backward from the goal state to create a sequence of successively more difficult training instances starting with ones that are guaranteed to be solvable by h0. The bootstrap process is then repeated using hi in lieu of hi−1 until a sufficiently strong heuristic is produced. We test this method on the 24-sliding-tile puzzle, the 35-pancake puzzle, Rubikʼs Cube, and the 20-blocks world. In every case our method produces a heuristic that allows IDA⁎ to solve randomly generated problem instances quickly with solutions close to optimal. The total time for the bootstrap process to create strong heuristics for these large state spaces is on the order of days. To make the process effective when only a single problem instance needs to be solved, we present a variation in which the bootstrap learning of new heuristics is interleaved with problem-solving using the initial heuristic and whatever heuristics have been learned so far. This substantially reduces the total time needed to solve a single instance, while the solutions obtained are still close to optimal.}

title={Speeding Up Search-Based Motion Planning using Expansion Delay Heuristics}, 
volume={31}, 
url={https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICAPS/article/view/16000}, 
abstractNote={Suboptimal search algorithms are a popular way to find solutions to planning problems faster by trading off solution optimality for search time. This is often achieved with the help of inadmissible heuristics. Prior work has explored ways to learn such inadmissible heuristics. However, it has focused on learning the heuristic value as an estimate of the cost to reach a goal. In this paper, we present a different approach that computes inadmissible heuristics by learning Expansion Delay for transitions in the state space. Expansion Delay is defined as the number of states expanded during the search between two consecutive states. Expansion Delay can be used as a measure of the depth of local minima regions i.e., regions where the heuristic(s) are weakly correlated with the true cost-to-goal (Vats, Narayanan and Likhachev 2017). Our key idea is to learn this measure in order to guide the search such that it reduces the total Expansion delay for reaching the goal and hence, avoid local minima regions in the state space. We analyze our method on 3D (x, y, theta) planning and Humanoid footstep planning. We find that the heuristics computed using our technique result in finding feasible plans faster.},

  abstract={ This paper introduces a novel mixture model-based approach to the simultaneous clustering and optimal segmentation of functional data, which are curves presenting regime changes. The proposed model consists of a finite mixture of piecewise polynomial regression models. Each piecewise polynomial regression model is associated with a cluster, and within each cluster, each piecewise polynomial component is associated with a regime (i.e., a segment). We derive two approaches to learning the model parameters: the first is an estimation approach which maximizes the observed-data likelihood via a dedicated expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, then yielding a fuzzy partition of the curves into K clusters obtained at convergence by maximizing the posterior cluster probabilities. The second is a classification approach and optimizes a specific classification likelihood criterion through a dedicated classification expectation-maximization (CEM) algorithm. The optimal curve segmentation is performed by using dynamic programming. In the classification approach, both the curve clustering and the optimal segmentation are performed simultaneously as the CEM learning proceeds. We show that the classification approach is a probabilistic version generalizing the deterministic K-means-like algorithm proposed in Hébrail, Hugueney, Lechevallier, and Rossi (2010). The proposed approach is evaluated using simulated curves and real-world curves. Comparisons with alternatives including regression mixture models and the K-means-like algorithm for piecewise regression demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {The problem of bi-clustering functional data, which has recently been addressed in literature, is considered. A definition of ideal functional bi-cluster is given and a novel bi-clustering method, called Functional Cheng and Church (FunCC), is developed. The introduced algorithm searches for non-overlapping and non-exhaustive bi-clusters in a set of functions which are naturally ordered in matrix structure through a non-parametric deterministic iterative procedure. Moreover, the possible misalignment of the data, which is a common problem when dealing with functions, is taken into account. Hence, the FunCC algorithm is extended obtaining a model able to jointly bi-cluster and align curves. Different simulation studies are performed to show the potential of the introduced method and to compare it with state-of-the-art methods. The model is also applied on a real case study allowing to discover the spatio-temporal patterns of a bike-sharing system.}

This method relies on the approximation of the notion of probability density for functional random variables, which generally does not exist. Using the Karhunen–Loeve expansion of a stochastic process, this approximation leads to define an approximation for the density of functional variables. Based on this density approximation, a parametric mixture model is proposed. The parameter estimation is carried out by an EM-like algorithm, and the maximum a posteriori rule provides the clusters. The efficiency of Funclust is illustrated on several real datasets, as well as for the characterization of the Mars surface.}

In this article, we study high-dimensional predictors and high-dimensional response and propose two procedures to cluster observations according to the link between predictors and the response. To reduce the dimension, we propose to use the Lasso estimator, which takes into account the sparsity and a maximum likelihood estimator penalized by the rank, to take into account the matrix structure. To choose the number of components and the sparsity level, we construct a collection of models, varying those two parameters and we select a model among this collection with a non-asymptotic criterion. We extend these procedures to functional data, where predictors and responses are functions. For this purpose, we use a wavelet-based approach. For each situation, we provide algorithms and apply and evaluate our methods both on simulated and real datasets, to understand how they work in practice.},

 abstract = {We propose a method for high-dimensional curve clustering in the presence of interindividual variability. Curve clustering has longly been studied especially using splines to account for functional random effects. However, splines are not appropriate when dealing with high-dimensional data and can not be used to model irregular curves such as peak-like data. Our method is based on a wavelet decomposition of the signal for both fixed and random effects. We propose an efficient dimension reduction step based on wavelet thresholding adapted to multiple curves and using an appropriate structure for the random effect variance, we ensure that both fixed and random effects lie in the same functional space even when dealing with irregular functions that belong to Besov spaces. In the wavelet domain our model resumes to a linear mixed-effects model that can be used for a model-based clustering algorithm and for which we develop an EM-algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation. The properties of the overall procedure are validated by an extensive simulation study. Then, we illustrate our method on mass spectrometry data and we propose an original application of functional data analysis on microarray comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) data. Our procedure is available through the R package curvclust which is the first publicly available package that performs curve clustering with random effects in the high dimensional framework (available on the CRAN).},

 abstract = {Economic data are frequently generated by stochastic processes that can be modelled as occurring in continuous time. That is, the data are treated as realizations of a random function (functional data). Sometimes an economic theory model specifies the process up to a finite-dimensional parameter. This paper develops a test of the null hypothesis that a given functional data set was generated by a specified parametric model of a continuous-time process. The alternative hypothesis is non-parametric. A random function is a form of infinite-dimensional random variable, and the test presented here a generalization of the familiar Cramér-von Mises test to an infinite dimensional random variable. The test is illustrated by using it to test the hypothesis that a sample of wage paths was generated by a certain equilibrium job search model.

abstract = {Clustering is an unsupervised process since there are no predefined classes and no examples that would indicate grouping properties in the data set. The majority of the clustering algorithms behave differently depending on the features of the data set and the initial assumptions for defining groups. Therefore, in most applications the resulting clustering scheme requires some sort of evaluation as regards its validity. Evaluating and assessing the results of a clustering algorithm is the main subject of cluster validity. In this paper we present a review of the clustering validity and methods. More specifically, Part I of the paper discusses the cluster validity approaches based on external and internal criteria.},

abstract = {A massive amount of data about individual electrical consumptions are now provided with new metering technologies and smart grids. These new data are especially useful for load profiling and load modeling at different scales of the electrical network. A new methodology based on mixture of high‐dimensional regression models is used to perform clustering of individual customers. It leads to uncovering clusters corresponding to different regression models. Temporal information is incorporated in order to prepare the next step, the fit of a forecasting model in each cluster. Only the electrical signal is involved, slicing the electrical signal into consecutive curves to consider it as a discrete time series of curves. Interpretation of the models is given on a real smart meter dataset of Irish customers.},

We review some fundamental concepts of FDA, their origins and connections from multivariate analysis, and some of its recent developments, including multi-level functional data analysis, high-dimensional functional regression, and dependent functional data analysis. We also discuss the impact of these new methodology developments on genetics, plant science, wearable device data analysis, image data analysis, and business analytics. Two real data examples are provided to motivate our discussions.}

However, proper statistical techniques are needed to make sense of this large amount of data and translate them into usable recommendations. Here, we apply Functional Data Analysis (FDA), a novel branch of Statistics that analyses functions—to identify drivers of residential electricity load curves. We evaluate a real time feedback intervention which involved about 1000 Italian households for a period of three years. Results of the FDA modelling reveal, for the first time, daytime-indexed patterns of residential electricity consumption which depend on the ownership of specific clusters of electrical appliances and an overall reduction of consumption after the introduction of real time feedback, unrelated to appliance ownership characteristics.},

abstract = { With the advance of modern technology, more and more data are being recorded continuously during a time interval or intermittently at several discrete time points. These are both examples of functional data, which has become a commonly encountered type of data. Functional data analysis (FDA) encompasses the statistical methodology for such data. Broadly interpreted, FDA deals with the analysis and theory of data that are in the form of functions. This paper provides an overview of FDA, starting with simple statistical notions such as mean and covariance functions, then covering some core techniques, the most popular of which is functional principal component analysis (FPCA). FPCA is an important dimension reduction tool, and in sparse data situations it can be used to impute functional data that are sparsely observed. Other dimension reduction approaches are also discussed. In addition, we review another core technique, functional linear regression, as well as clustering and classification of functional data. Beyond linear and single- or multiple- index methods, we touch upon a few nonlinear approaches that are promising for certain applications. They include additive and other nonlinear functional regression models and models that feature time warping, manifold learning, and empirical differential equations. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of future directions. }

    "abstract": "We consider stationary fluctuations for the multi-species zero range process with long jumps in one dimension, where the underlying transition probability kernel is $p(x) = c_+ |x|^{-1-α}$ if $x > 0$ and $= c_-|x|^{-1-α}$ if $x < 0$. Above, $c_{\\pm} \\geq 0, α> 0$ are parameters. We prove that for $0 < α< 3/2$, the density fluctuation fields converge to the stationary solution of a coupled fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, and for $α=3/2$, the limit points are concentrated on stationary energy solutions to a coupled fractional Burgers equation.",

    "abstract": "To what extent can the patient's length of stay in a hospital be predicted using only an X-ray image? We answer this question by comparing the performance of machine learning survival models on a novel multi-modal dataset created from 1235 images with textual radiology reports annotated by humans. Although black-box models predict better on average than interpretable ones, like Cox proportional hazards, they are not inherently understandable. To overcome this trust issue, we introduce time-dependent model explanations into the human-AI decision making process. Explaining models built on both: human-annotated and algorithm-extracted radiomics features provides valuable insights for physicians working in a hospital. We believe the presented approach to be general and widely applicable to other time-to-event medical use cases. For reproducibility, we open-source code and the TLOS dataset at https://github.com/mi2datalab/xlungs-trustworthy-los-prediction.",

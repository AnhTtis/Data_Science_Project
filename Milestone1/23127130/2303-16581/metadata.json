    "abstract": "Reducing the computation time of model predictive control (MPC) is important, especially for systems constrained by many state constraints. In this paper, we propose a new online constraint removal framework for linear systems, for which we coin the term constraint-adaptive MPC (ca-MPC). In so-called exact ca-MPC, we adapt the imposed constraints by removing, at each time-step, a subset of the state constraints in order to reduce the computational complexity of the receding-horizon optimal control problem, while ensuring that the closed-loop behavior is {\\em identical} to that of the original MPC law. We also propose an approximate ca-MPC scheme in which a further reduction of computation time can be accomplished by a tradeoff with closed-loop performance, while still preserving recursive feasibility, stability, and constraint satisfaction properties. The online constraint removal exploits fast backward and forward reachability computations combined with optimality properties.",

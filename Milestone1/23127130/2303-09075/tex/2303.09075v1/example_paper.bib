 abstract = {Using large-scale training data to build a pre-trained language model (PLM) with a larger volume of parameters can significantly improve downstream tasks. For example, OpenAI trained the GPT3 model with 175 billion parameters on 570 GB English training data, enabling downstream applications building with only a small number of samples. However, there is a lack of Chinese corpus to support large-scale PLMs. This paper introduces a super large-scale Chinese corpora WuDaoCorpora, containing about 3 TB training data and 1.08 trillion Chinese characters. We also release the base version of WuDaoCorpora, containing about 200 GB training data and 72 billion Chinese characters. As a baseline, we train a model transformer-XL with 3 billion parameters on the base version to test the corpora's effect. The results show that the models trained on this corpora can achieve excellent performance in Chinese. The data and model are available at https://data.wudaoai.cn and https://github.com/THUDM/Chinese-Transformer-XL, respectively.},

 abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI), along with the recent progress in biomedical language understanding, is gradually offering great promise for medical practice. With the development of biomedical language understanding benchmarks, AI applications are widely used in the medical field. However, most benchmarks are limited to English, which makes it challenging to replicate many of the successes in English for other languages. To facilitate research in this direction, we collect real-world biomedical data and present the first Chinese Biomedical Language Understanding Evaluation (CBLUE) benchmark: a collection of natural language understanding tasks including named entity recognition, information extraction, clinical diagnosis normalization, single-sentence/sentence-pair classification, and an associated online platform for model evaluation, comparison, and analysis. To establish evaluation on these tasks, we report empirical results with the current 11 pre-trained Chinese models, and experimental results show that state-of-the-art neural models perform by far worse than the human ceiling.},

    abstract = "BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) and RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) has set a new state-of-the-art performance on sentence-pair regression tasks like semantic textual similarity (STS). However, it requires that both sentences are fed into the network, which causes a massive computational overhead: Finding the most similar pair in a collection of 10,000 sentences requires about 50 million inference computations ({\textasciitilde}65 hours) with BERT. The construction of BERT makes it unsuitable for semantic similarity search as well as for unsupervised tasks like clustering. In this publication, we present Sentence-BERT (SBERT), a modification of the pretrained BERT network that use siamese and triplet network structures to derive semantically meaningful sentence embeddings that can be compared using cosine-similarity. This reduces the effort for finding the most similar pair from 65 hours with BERT / RoBERTa to about 5 seconds with SBERT, while maintaining the accuracy from BERT. We evaluate SBERT and SRoBERTa on common STS tasks and transfer learning tasks, where it outperforms other state-of-the-art sentence embeddings methods.",

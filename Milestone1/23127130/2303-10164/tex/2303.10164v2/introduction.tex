\textit{Introduction.}
%
The electrical transport properties of nonmagnetic crystals change
under an applied magnetic field, leading to different phenomena that
can be generally described as an expansion of the current in powers of
the electric and magnetic fields $\E$ and $\B$,
%
\beq
j_a = \sigma_{ab}(\B) E_b + \sigma_{abc} (\B) E_b E_c + \ldots\,.
\eql{j-E-expansion}
\eeq
%
The ordinary and planar Hall effects~\cite{hurd-book72}, as well as
the ordinary magnetoresistance~\cite{pippard1989magnetoresistance},
are all contained in the first term.  Electrical responses that are
quadratic in $\E$ (second term) become allowed in
noncentrosymmetric media, and have recently attracted a great deal of
attention. One example is the nonlinear anomalous Hall effect, a
transverse response that occurs in the absence of an external magnetic
field and without requiring magnetic
  order~\cite{deyo-arxiv09,PhysRevLett.115.216806,kang2019nonlinear}.

Another example of an $\E^2$ response is
electrical magnetochiral anisotropy
(eMChA)~\cite{Rikken01,atzori-chir21},
an anomalous magnetoresistance that is bilinear in $\B$ and in
the applied current~$\I$.
The resistance of a material exhibiting eMChA takes the form
\beq
R(B,I) = (1 + \beta B^2 + \gamma I B)R_0\,,
\eql{R-B-I}
\eeq
%
where the coefficients $\beta$ and $\gamma$ describe ordinary
  magnetoresistance and eMChA, respectively (the tensorial character
  of the various quantities is ignored for now).  The coefficient
$\gamma$ vanishes in centrosymmetric systems, and in chiral media it
is equal in magnitude and opposite in sign for right- and left-handed
enantiomers. As eMChA is not restricted to chiral systems, it is
sometimes referred to by other names such as bulk
current-rectification effect~\cite{ideue-natphys17}, nonreciprocal
resistance~\cite{ideue-natphys17,yoshimi-prb22}, and unidirectional
magnetoresistance~\cite{tokura-natcomms18,calavalle2022gate}.

The eMChA has been measured in several
chiral systems including bismuth helices~\cite{Rikken01},
single-walled carbon nanotubes~\cite{krstic-jcp02},
molecular conductors~\cite{pop2014electrical},
noncentrosymmetric transition metal dichalcogenide~\cite{emchaWTe2}, and trigonal
tellurium~\cite{Rikken19,Hirobe22,calavalle2022gate,niu2023tunable},
as well as in the nonchiral polar semiconductor
BiTeBr~\cite{ideue-natphys17}. 
%\Red{A strong eMChA response has also been
%reported in two nominally centrosymmetric materials --~the layered
%semimetal ZrTe$_5$~\cite{wang-prl22} and the kagome metal
%CsV$_3$Sb$_5$~\cite{guo2022switchable}~~- suggesting that they
%actually assume broken-symmetry forms.}
%　
Similar nonreciprocal responses
% in superconductors
have also been reported both in Josephson junctions
\cite{JJ-SDE-2022,JJ-SDE-2022-NiTe2} and in junction-free
superconductors \cite{MoS2-SDE,NbTaV-SDE,SDE-2022-NbSe2}.

% While magnetotransport phenomena linear in the electric field $\E$
% have been thoroughly investigated, the breaking of inversion symmetry
% in the crystal structure opens the possibility of nonlinear
% (second-order in $\E$) effects. \tents{Already i}n the absence of

% \color{magenta} One such effect is electrical magneto-chiral
% anisotropy (eMChA)~\cite{Rikken01}, which consists of a change in
% resistance that depends linearly on \st{$\E$ and} $\B$ and on the
% current density $\I$.  Quite generally, the linear resistance of a
% nonmagnetic crystal can be expressed as
% %
% \beq
% R(\B,\I) = R_0 (1 + \beta \B^2 + \gamma \B \cdot \I)~,
% \eql{R-B-I}
% \eeq

%   It has been observed in bismuth
%   helices~\cite{Rikken01}, chiral structured molecular
%   conductors~\cite{pop2014electrical}, a charge-ordered kagome
%   metal~\cite{guo2022switchable}, and chiral magnetic
%   systems~\cite{yokouchi2017electrical,PhysRevLett.122.057206}, and
%   recently in $p$-doped trigonal tellurium \tents{(Te)} as
%   well~\cite{Rikken19}.
% %
% \ism{Add Ref.~\cite{calavalle2022gate} (nanogune paper) here?}
% %
% The
% common feature of these systems is that they are all chiral,
% %
% \ism{Being chiral is sufficient but necessary. Essentially the same
%   effect has been observed in the nonchiral but polar semiconductor
%   BiTeBr \href{http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nphys4056}{(see here)}. The
%   name eMChA has historical roots, but is inaccurate. Can we refer the
%   reader to a review paper at the end of this paragraph?}

% and hence
% can exist in the form of either dexter (D) or laevus (L) handed
% enantiomers.  In particular, trigonal elemental Te, atoms are
% helically stacked along the z-axis with a helical period of three
% atoms based on a hexagonal lattice
% \cite{doi:10.1063/1.1743647}.\stm{maybe place this statement later\\
% \tents{IS: I agree.}}

%In 2019, Rikken and Avarvari \cite{Rikken19} observed a change in the resistance of trigonal $p$-doped tellurium, which %linearly depends on $\B$ and appiled current $\I$.

%trigonal Tellurium (Te) under room temperature, which \st{is} 
%linearly depends on $\E$ and $\B$. 
%\tents{This was the first observation of the electrical magneto-chiral anisotropy (eMChA) in bulk crystals, however the effect was previously known, for instance,  in bismuth helices\cite{Rikken01}.
%In trigonal elemental Te, atoms are helically stacked along the z-axis with a helical
%period of three atoms based on a hexagonal lattice \cite{doi:10.1063/1.1743647}.
%The chiral structure breaks the inversion symmetry and
%generates colossal chiral dependent axial Berry curvature and magnetic moment \cite{stepan18}.

% \ism{Added reference.  In Ref.~\cite{Rikken01} as well as other
%   references, they write $\beta$ instead of $\mu^2$. Maybe the $\mu^2$
%   in Ref.~\cite{Rikken19} was a typo?}
% %
% \beq
% R^\text{D/L} (\B,\I) = R_0 (1 + \mu^2 \B^2 + \gamma^\text{D/L} \B \cdot \I)~,
% \eql{R-DL}
% \eeq
% %
% where  $\gamma^\text{D} = - \gamma^\text{L}$ describes the eMChA of the two enantiomers, $\mu$ describes the magnetoresistance, and $R_0$ is the linear resistance in the absence of $\B$.
% %Ohmic resistance, magnetoresistance, and eMChA resistance are shown in \eq{R-DL} on the right-hand side. 
% %The measurable tensor $\gamma^{D/L}$ which is the ratio of eMChA resistance and Ohmic resistance, 
% %can be peeled off by reversing the magnetic field.
% %This chirality-dependent transport property is also found in chiral structured monoculars \cite{pop2014electrical}, 
% %charge-ordered kagome metal \cite{guo2022switchable}, and chiral magnetic systems \cite{yokouchi2017electrical,PhysRevLett.%122.057206}. 

Recently, Calavalle \textit{et al.}~\cite{calavalle2022gate} reported
the manipulation and detection of eMChA
% by measuring the longitudinal second-order response voltage
in tellurium nanowires at low
temperatures.
% They concluded that the chiral-induced spin polarization leads to
% the unique magnetotransport.  The longitudinal response is pure,
% because it avoids interference from Hall-like effects.
Motivated by this work and by that of Refs.~\cite{Rikken19,Hirobe22}, here we
undertake an \textit{ab initio} study of the eMChA response in
$p$-doped trigonal tellurium ($p$-Te). As it
crystallizes in the simplest chiral structure with only three atoms
per cell, elemental tellurium is an ideal prototype material for
performing % the first
bulk \textit{ab initio} calculations of eMChA.

\textit{Bulk tensorial description.} To formulate eMChA as a bulk
response, we divide \eq{R-B-I} by the cross-section area $A$ of the
sample, converting from resistance $R$ and current $I$ to resistivity
$\rho$ and current density $j$. Dropping the
% $B^2$ term that describes
ordinary magnetoresistance term and defining $\gamma'=\gamma A$, we obtain
%
\beq
\rho(B,j)=(1+\gamma' j B)\rho_0\,,
\eql{rho-B-j}
\eeq
%
where the tensorial character is again ignored.

While experimentally one applies currents and measures voltages,
microscopic theory deals instead with the current density induced by
the applied fields, as in \eq{j-E-expansion}.  We expand $\sigma(\B)$
in powers of $\B$, leaving only terms that are proportional to $E$ and
$E^2B$ \ to find
%
\beq
j_a =
\sigma_{ab}E_b +
\sigma_{abcd}E_b E_c B_d\,,
\eql{j-E-EEB}
\eeq
%
where $\sigma_{ab}$ is the linear Ohmic conductivity, $\sigma_{abcd}$
is the eMChA magnetoconductivity, and a summation over repeated
Cartesian indices is implied.  Solving for $\E$ as a function of $\B$
and $\j$ to order $\B\j^2$, one arrives at the following tensorial
generalization of \eq{rho-B-j},
%
\beq
\rho_{ae}(\B,\j)=(\delta_{ab}+\gamma'_{abcd} j_c B_d)\rho_{be}\,,
\eql{rho-Bj}
\eeq
%
where $\rho_{ac}\sigma_{cb}=\delta_{ab}$, and
%
\beq
\gamma'_{abcd}=-\rho_{aa'}\sigma_{a'bb'd}\rho_{b'c}
\eql{gamma-prime}
\eeq
%
is the bulk eMChA tensor. Thus, the main task of a predictive bulk
theory of eMChA is to evaluate the conductivity tensors $\sigma_{ab}$
and $\sigma_{abcd}$ defined by \eq{j-E-EEB} that are needed to
evaluate $\gamma'_{abcd}$ from \eq{gamma-prime}. 
Note that while
$\sigma_{abcd}$ has the intrinsic permutation symmetry
$\sigma_{abcd}=\sigma_{acbd}$, the relation
$\gamma'_{abcd}=\gamma'_{acbd}$ only holds when the Cartesian axes are
chosen as principal axes of the Ohmic resistivity $\rho_{ab}$.

    "abstract": "Structural chirality induces characteristic responses that change sign with the handedness of the crystal structure. One example is electrical magnetochiral anisotropy (eMChA), a change in resistivity that depends linearly on the applied current and magnetic field. A strong eMChA was recently reported for $p$-doped tellurium. With this motivation, we carry out an \\textit{ab initio} study of its bulk eMChA response as a function of temperature and doping concentration. We use the semiclassical Boltzmann transport formalism within the constant relaxation-time approximation to express the current density at order $E^2B$ in terms of the energy dispersion, intrinsic magnetic moment, and Berry curvature of conduction electrons. We find that the orbital Zeeman coupling dominates the response, with smaller contributions coming from the spin-Zeeman coupling and from the Berry curvature. The agreement with the available experimental data is satisfactory.",

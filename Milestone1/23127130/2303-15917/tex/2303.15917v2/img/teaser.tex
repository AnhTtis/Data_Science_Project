	\caption{In this work, we investigate motion synchronization as a means of establishing trust between humans and simple non-humanoid robots. We built a prototype that can track and synchronize with the upper body movements of humans. The orientation of the continuum robot tip (B) is transformed according to changes in the orientation of the sensor attached to the participant's back (A).}
	\Description{Frame from video camera showing the free exploratory phase of the experiment. On the left prototype bends to the right, and on the right person interacting with the prototype bends to the right. On the picture market, two lines show how the orientation of the continuum robot tip is transformed according to changes in the orientation of the sensor attached to the participant's back.}

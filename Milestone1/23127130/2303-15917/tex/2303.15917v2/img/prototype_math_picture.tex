\caption{Frame from video camera: A - sensor coordinate system; B - prototype's backbone tip coordinate system. System B is transformed according to system A changes induced by participant movement. This transformation is making bending of machine backbone imitating the human body spine bending - on the picture marked with blue lines.}

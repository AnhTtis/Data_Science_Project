\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

%% Motivation:
%%  - scientific meaning of polar region
%%  - AUV is a potential tool for ice-water interface
%%  - underwater state estimation is an open problem
The ocean in polar regions plays a vital role, affecting the global biogeochemical cycle~\cite{SeaIceRole-Vancoppenolle-2013, Glacier-VolcanicSource_Loose_2018} and the ice-water interface is an active region where transports between ice and water can set the biogeochemical and determine growth in the zones where sunlight penetrates. Despite limited resources, the under ice environment can experience large plankton blooms \cite{arrigo2012massive}, but very little is understood about how they take place.  
Previously, underwater vehicles have been successfully deployed to collect physical and biogeochemical measurements under sea ice~\cite{IceThickness_Wadhams_2012,AlgalCommunities_Robison_2011}.
Recently, under-ice AUV deployments~\citeleft\citenum{Icefin-Spears-2016, Autosub2000_Phillips_2020, Icemap-Williams-2014}\citeright ~have been carried out in regions that were previously inaccessible to observation, and to produce a higher spatial coverage to fill the observation gaps left by traditional ice-anchored instruments and ice coring.  AUVs and ROVs are uniquely capable of observing these environments in a manner that creates almost no disturbance, while traditional ice observations involve perforating the ice, which upsets the delicate physical structure, thereby biasing the resulting measurements.
% 
However, the localization (i.e., state estimation) is particularly challenging in underwater environments due to the lack of GPS~\cite{AUV-Localization-Review_Paull_2014}.
Under-ice AUV operation is an extreme case that AUVs could not return to the surface to obtain the GPS fixes for bounding the localization drift \cite{UnderIce-VehicleDesign_Barker_2020}. 
Therefore, the collected measurements are hard to georeference, challenging the creation of spatially coherent maps of the processes, e.g., the algae patchiness, and sea-ice surface topography.

%% Challenge 1: challenging motion
%   - acoustic beacon
%   		- installation and calibration	
% 	- DVL: 
% 		- drift
% 		- more drift for low speed (SNR higher)  
Acoustic transducer arrays, such as Long Baseline (LBL) \cite{LBL-Underice_Jakuba_2008} and Ultra-short Baseline (USBL) \cite{USBL-Underice_Kukulya_2010}, are commonly used for under-ice navigation.
But, they will require installation and extrinsic calibration for transducers.
In the under-ice environment, the performance of acoustic communication devices may degrade due to up-bending sound propagation and ice keel blockage~\cite{UnderIce-AcousticCom_Freitag_2017}.
To this end, self-contained underwater navigation methods are researched and often used as it requires fewer logistic operations.
The most common one is the dead-reckoning navigation~\cite{DVL-Nav_Whitcomb_1999} which fuses velocity measured by a DVL and an inertial measurement sensor.
However, this method suffers from unbounded position errors ranging from 8 to 22 m for different quality Inertial Navigation System (INS)~\cite{ModelNav_Randeni_2018}.
% We also have observed that if an AUV is experiencing irregular motions such as low-speed cruising, quick turns and hovering, the navigation drift will grow rapidly possibly due to the reduced signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio in the IMU and DVL measurements. 

%% Challenge 2: challenging images
%%  - Visual:
%%    - dynamic illumination
%%		- motion blur
%%		- light attenuation 
%%    - limited visibility
%%  - VIO:
%% 		- more detail, workng with imu
%%		- still not stable
For the ice-water boundary exploration, vehicles would maintain a close distance (1 to 2 m) in order to collect vital measurements (such as sea-ice roughness, light penetration and water density) to study the ice-water exchanges. 
The close distance makes it possible to use camera images to aid underwater localization for AUVs.
In recent years, Visual-Odometry (VO)/Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) has drawn increased attention, serving the rapid development in robot autonomy.
%
To improve the robustness of state estimation, Visual-Inertial-Odometry (VIO)~\cite{VIO-Review_Huang_2019} has been widely used. 
However, underwater visual-based SLAM is still challenging because of the dynamic illumination, limited visibility, light obstruction, texture-less area and motion blur \cite{Underwater-VIO-Survey_Joshi_2019}. 
Also, Mono-VIO has a well-known issue that the metric scale is not observable if there is no acceleration excitation. 
In such case, additional sensors (e.g., stereo-camera~\cite{SVIn2_Rahman_2019}) are needed for reliable and accurate SLAM solutions in the underwater environment.

%% Challenge 3: 
%% 	- realtime running onboard
The algorithm development always has to consider the trade-off between accuracy and computational cost when deploying on the robotics platform. 
Non-linear optimization-based VIO (e.g., OKVIS~\cite{OKVIS_Leutenegger_2015}) allows for the reduction of error through relinearization but with a high computational cost. 
Filtering-based VIO (e.g., MSCKF~\cite{MSCKF_Mourikis_2007}) is proven to be efficient and accurate in resources constraint applications, e.g, the state-of-the-art ARCore~\cite{ARCore} running on mobile devices.
To deal with the degraded performance that may exist when only using the one-time linearization, observability-based methodology~\cite{OC-MSCKF_Huang_2008} can be applied to improve the consistency. 
More details about the relevant works can be found in Section II.

%% our work DVL-Pressure-VIO
In this paper, we present a multi-modal sensor fusion framework to address the two challenges in underwater environments: degenerate motion and challenging image conditions.
Our method fuses the measurements from DVL, IMU, camera and pressure sensor in the MSCKF framework to improve the robustness of state estimation.
Our main contributions\footnote{code: \url{https://github.com/GSO-soslab/msckf_dvio}} are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A modified keyframe marginalization method to increase the tracking period of features.
  \item A DVL point cloud enhanced feature position recovery with a new data association and estimation approach, presented in Section IV.
  \item Algorithm validation and comparison with different sensor enable/disable settings using a real-world under-ice ROV data set, presented in Section V
  % \item compare with state-of-art VIO algorithm
\end{itemize}

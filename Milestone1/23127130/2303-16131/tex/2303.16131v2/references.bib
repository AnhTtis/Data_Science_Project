  abstract = {Magnetic special relativity                            Magnetic materials have domains, patches of ordered spins that are separated from one another by boundaries called domain walls. These boundaries can be driven by electrical currents, a phenomenon forming the basis of the so-called racetrack memories. The speed of the domain walls has steadily increased as experimenters have perfected these devices. Caretta               et al.               now show experimentally that this speed is fundamentally limited (see the Perspective by Daniels and Stiles). Just as no object can travel faster than the speed of light, the speed of the domain walls saturates to a constant determined only by the properties of the magnetic host material.                                         Science               , this issue p.               1438               ; see also p.               1413                        ,              The speed of driven magnetic domain walls is fundamentally limited in analogy to special relativity.           ,              A tenet of special relativity is that no particle can exceed the speed of light. In certain magnetic materials, the maximum magnon group velocity serves as an analogous relativistic limit for the speed of magnetic solitons. Here, we drive domain walls to this limit in a low-dissipation magnetic insulator using pure spin currents from the spin Hall effect. We achieve record current-driven velocities in excess of 4300 meters per second\textemdash within \textasciitilde 10\% of the relativistic limit\textemdash and we observe key signatures of relativistic motion associated with Lorentz contraction, which leads to velocity saturation. The experimental results are well explained through analytical and atomistic modeling. These observations provide critical insight into the fundamental limits of the dynamics of magnetic solitons and establish a readily accessible experimental framework to study relativistic solitonic physics.}

  abstract = {Abstract                            Sub-picosecond magnetisation manipulation via femtosecond optical pumping has attracted wide attention ever since its original discovery in 1996. However, the spatial evolution of the magnetisation is not yet well understood, in part due to the difficulty in experimentally probing such rapid dynamics. Here, we find evidence of a universal rapid magnetic order recovery in ferrimagnets with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy via nonlinear magnon processes. We identify magnon localisation and coalescence processes, whereby localised magnetic textures nucleate and subsequently interact and grow in accordance with a power law formalism. A hydrodynamic representation of the numerical simulations~indicates that the appearance of noncollinear magnetisation via optical pumping establishes exchange-mediated spin currents with an equivalent 100\% spin polarised charge current density of 10               7               \,A\,cm               -2               . Such large spin currents precipitate rapid recovery of magnetic order after optical pumping. The magnon processes discussed here provide new insights for the stabilization of desired meta-stable states.}

  abstract = {Ni\$\_\{0.8\}\$Fe\$\_\{0.2\}\$ (Py) and Py alloyed with Cu exhibit intriguing ultrafast demagnetization behavior, where the Ni magnetic moment shows a delayed response relative to the Fe, an effect which is strongly enhanced by Cu alloying. We have studied a broad range of Cu concentrations to elucidate the effects of Cu alloying in Py. The orbital/spin magnetic moment ratios are largely unaffected by Cu alloying, signifying that Cu-induced changes in the ultrafast demagnetization are not related to spin-orbit interactions. We show that magnon diffusion can explain the delayed Ni response, which we attribute to an enhanced magnon generation rate in the Fe sublattice relative to the Ni sublattice. Furthermore, Py exhibits prominent RKKY-like exchange interactions, which are strongly enhanced between Fe atoms and diminished between Ni atoms by Cu alloying. An increased Fe magnon scattering rate is expected to occur concurrently with this increased Fe-Fe exchange interaction, supporting the results obtained from the magnon diffusion model.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Non-collinear spin textures in ferromagnetic ultrathin films are attracting a renewed interest fueled by possible fine engineering of several magnetic interactions, notably the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. This allows for the stabilization of complex chiral spin textures such as chiral magnetic domain walls (DWs), spin spirals, and magnetic skyrmions among others. We report here on the behavior of chiral DWs at ultrashort timescale after optical pumping in perpendicularly magnetized asymmetric multilayers. The magnetization dynamics is probed using time-resolved circular dichroism in x-ray resonant magnetic scattering (CD-XRMS). We observe a picosecond transient reduction of the CD-XRMS, which is attributed to the spin current-induced coherent and incoherent torques within the continuously varying spin texture of the DWs. We argue that a specific demagnetization of the inner structure of the DW induces a flow of spins from the interior of the neighboring magnetic domains. We identify this time-varying change of the DW texture shortly after the laser pulse as a distortion of the homochiral N\'eel shape toward a transient mixed Bloch-N\'eel-Bloch texture along a direction transverse to the DW.}

  abstract = {Abstract             Exciting a ferromagnetic material with an ultrashort IR laser pulse is known to induce spin dynamics by heating the spin system and by ultrafast spin diffusion processes. Here, we report on measurements of spin-profiles and spin diffusion properties in the vicinity of domain walls in the interface region between a metallic Al layer and a ferromagnetic Co/Pd thin film upon IR excitation. We followed the ultrafast temporal evolution by means of an ultrafast resonant magnetic scattering experiment in surface scattering geometry, which enables us to exploit the evolution of the domain network within a 1/e distance of 3\,nm to 5\,nm from the Al/FM film interface. We observe a magnetization-reversal close to the domain wall boundaries that becomes more pronounced closer to the Al/FM film interface. This magnetization-reversal is driven by the different transport properties of majority and minority carriers through a magnetically disordered domain network. Its finite lateral extension has allowed us to measure the ultrafast spin-diffusion coefficients and ultrafast spin velocities for majority and minority carriers upon IR excitation.}

  abstract = {We investigate the ultrafast spin dynamics in an epitaxial hcp(1100) cobalt thin film. By performing pump\textendash probe magneto-optical measurements with the magnetization along either the easy or hard magnetic axis, we determine the demagnetization and recovery time for the two axes. We observe an average of 33\% slower dynamics along the easy magnetization axis, which we attribute to magneto-crystalline anisotropy of the electron\textendash phonon coupling, supported by our ab initio calculations. This points toward an unambiguous and previously undisclosed role of anisotropic electron\textendash lattice coupling in ultrafast magnetism.}

  abstract = {Abstract                            Nonequilibrium phase transitions play a pivotal role in broad physical contexts, from condensed matter to cosmology. Tracking the formation of nonequilibrium phases in condensed matter requires a resolution of the long-range cooperativity on ultra-short timescales. Here, we study the spontaneous transformation of a charge-density wave in CeTe               3               from a stripe order into a bi-directional state inaccessible thermodynamically but is induced by intense laser pulses. With {$\approx$}100\,fs resolution coherent electron diffraction, we capture the entire course of this transformation and show self-organization that defines a nonthermal critical point, unveiling the nonequilibrium energy landscape. We discuss the generation of instabilities by a swift interaction quench that changes the system symmetry preference, and the phase ordering dynamics orchestrated over a nonadiabatic timescale to allow new order parameter fluctuations to gain long-range correlations. Remarkably, the subsequent thermalization locks the remnants of the transient order into longer-lived topological defects for more than 2\,ns.}

The magnetic soliton is regardedas a bound state of a large number of elementary magnetic excitations, i.e. magnons. Mathematical considerations ofsolitons in one-, two- and three-dimensional magnets are proposed. Dynamic and topological solitons, domain walls, rotary waves, magnetic vortices and magnon drops are treated in terms of the general approach. Both ferromagnets with different types of anisotropy (easy axis, easy plane, XYZ-anisotropy) and antiferromagnets are discussed. The difference between dynamic and topological solitons is explai},

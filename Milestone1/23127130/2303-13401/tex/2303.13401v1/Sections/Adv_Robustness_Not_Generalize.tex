\subsection{Why pattern matters}

\paragraph{Intrinsic multiple global optimizers to the max problem}
\label{Subsec: multi-maximizers}

\js{argument/numerical evidence for the existence of multiple global optimizers, and multiple patterns}
Argument: CE and Margin Loss equation suggest multiple solutions theoretically
Numeric Evidence: May try Margin Loss with Different Initialization on a single Image.

\paragraph{Neural networks are robust to similar patterns seen during training}
\js{same norm, different patterns: any violation of the existing generalization theory? } 
Experiment: Use Lp(e.g, p=1, 4, 8, inf) attack L2 pretrained model.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a conforming discontinuous Galerkin (CDG) finite element method for Brinkman equations. The velocity stabilizer is removed by employing the higher degree polynomials to compute the weak gradient. The theoretical analysis shows that the CDG method is actually stable and accurate for the Brinkman equations. Optimal order error estimates are established in $H^1$ and $L^2$ norm. Finally, numerical experiments verify the stability and accuracy of the CDG numerical scheme.",

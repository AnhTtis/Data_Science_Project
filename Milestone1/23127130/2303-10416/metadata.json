    "abstract": "The effect of thermal treatment on relaxation phenomena in Kr matrices irradiated with a low energy electron beam has been studied. The experiments were performed employing measurements of the relaxation emissions from preliminary irradiated Kr samples - quench-condensed and annealed before exposure to an electron beam. Three emissions were monitored in correlated in real time manner: thermally stimulated luminescence, thermally stimulated electron emission and total yield of particles via pressure measurements. The energy levels of defects were estimated from the thermally stimulated luminescence data of the annealed sample. Two types of electron-hole traps created by electronic excitation were identified - close pairs and distant ones. Additional confirmation of the \"excited state\" mechanism of defect formation was obtained. Analysis of the yields correlation and effect of thermal treatment gave additional arguments in support of the so-called crowdion model of anomalous low temperature ejection of particles from preliminary irradiated Kr matrices.",

    "abstract": "The role of modulation instability (MI) in oceanic rogue waves has been hotly debated for years. The onset of instability has been predicted when the wave power spectrum becomes too narrow, but numerical investigations of this have produced mixed results. In this work we identify a clear reason why instability is suppressed in many simulations. Indeed, simulations are performed on a bounded computational domain of characteristic length $L$ with periodic boundary conditions. Here we show for the first time that there exists a bifurcation length $L_c=O(λ_0^2),$ below which no MI whatsoever is present. The analysis is carried out on the level of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLS) both for plane waves and for more general power spectra, and is complemented by numerical results. This result highlights the non-local character of the MI. Moreover, it establishes the need for computational domains in the hundreds of wavelengths $λ_0,$ if we are to meaningfully investigate the onset of MI in water waves. This fundamental scaling of the MI captured here is expected to carry over to the full water wave equations for quasi-unidirectional problems.",

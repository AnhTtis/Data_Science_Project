\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we propose ERSAM, a dedicated framework for developing continuous, real-time, on-device DNN based SAM to meet all three requirements on the execution latency (e.g., $\leq$ 5 seconds), energy (e.g., $\leq$ 700mW $\cdot$ 12 h), and size of training data  (e.g., audio recordings of $\leq$ 8 hours in total) towards practical adoption. This framework consists of: \underline{(i)} a hardware-aware search space dedicated to SAM; and \underline{(ii)} an efficient knowledge distillation scheme to be embedded in the search and training processes. The DNN model \textcolor{black}{searched by our ERSAM} achieves better accuracy vs. hardware efficiency trade-offs than previous state-of-the-art works and fulfills all the requirements towards continuous, real-time, on-device SAM.

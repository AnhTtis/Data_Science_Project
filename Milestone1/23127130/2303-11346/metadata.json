    "abstract": "A reliable determination of probability density functions from data samples is still a relevant topic in scientific applications. In this work we investigate the possibility of defining an algorithm for density function estimation using adiabatic quantum computing. Starting from a sample of a one-dimensional distribution, we define a classical-to-quantum data embedding procedure which maps the empirical cumulative distribution function of the sample into time dependent Hamiltonian using adiabatic quantum evolution. The obtained Hamiltonian is then projected into a quantum circuit using the time evolution operator. Finally, the probability density function of the sample is obtained using quantum hardware differentiation through the parameter shift rule algorithm. We present successful numerical results for predefined known distributions and high-energy physics Monte Carlo simulation samples.",

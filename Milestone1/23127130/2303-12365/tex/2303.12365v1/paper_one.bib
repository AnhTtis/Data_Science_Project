  abstract   = {The crosscap number of a knot is an invariant describing the nonorientable surface of smallest genus that the knot bounds. Unlike knot genus (its orientable counterpart), crosscap numbers are difficult to compute and no general algorithm is known. We present three methods for computing crosscap number that offer varying trade-offs between precision and speed: (i) an algorithm based on Hilbert basis enumeration and (ii) an algorithm based on exact integer programming, both of which either compute the solution precisely or reduce it to two possible values, and (iii) a fast but limited precision integer programming algorithm that bounds the solution from above.The first two algorithms advance the theoretical state-of-the-art, but remain intractable for practical use. The third algorithm is fast and effective, which we show in a practical setting by making significant improvements to the current knowledge of crosscap numbers in knot tables. Our integer programming framework is general, with the potential for further applications in computational geometry and topology.},

They in fact proved that this is true for {\$}{\$}n{\backslash}le 15{\$}{\$}, but left open the possibility of non-hamiltonian graphs of 16 or 17 nodes. By using ILP for modeling a counterexample, and then finding out that the model has no solutions, we give an algorithmic proof that their conjecture was indeed correct.},

  abstract   = {Mixed integer programming has become a very powerful tool for modeling and solving real-world planning and scheduling problems, with the breadth of applications appearing to be almost unlimited. A critical component in the solution of these mixed integer programs is a set of routines commonly referred to as presolve. Presolve can be viewed as a collection of preprocessing techniques that reduce the size of and, more importantly, improve the “strength” of the given model formulation, that is, the degree to which the constraints of the formulation accurately describe the underlying polyhedron of integer-feasible solutions. As our computational results will show, presolve is a key factor in the speed with which we can solve mixed integer programs and is often the difference between a model being intractable and solvable, in some cases easily solvable. In this paper we describe the presolve functionality in the Gurobi commercial mixed integer programming code. This includes an overview, or taxonomy of the different methods that are employed, as well as more-detailed descriptions of several of the techniques, with some of them appearing, to our knowledge, for the first time in the literature.},

  abstract  = { 'Satisfiability (SAT) related topics have attracted researchers from various disciplines: logic, applied areas such as planning, scheduling, operations research and combinatorial optimization, but also theoretical issues on the theme of complexity and much more, they all are connected through SAT. My personal interest in SAT stems from actual solving: The increase in power of modern SAT solvers over the past 15 years has been phenomenal. It has become the key enabling technology in automated verification of both computer hardware and software. Bounded Model Checking (BMC) of computer hardware is now probably the most widely used model checking technique. The counterexamples that it finds are just satisfying instances of a Boolean formula obtained by unwinding to some fixed depth a sequential circuit and its specification in linear temporal logic. Extending model checking to software verification is a much more difficult problem on the frontier of current research. One promising approach for languages like C with finite word-length integers is to use the same idea as in BMC but with a decision procedure for the theory of bit-vectors instead of SAT. All decision procedures for bit-vectors that I am familiar with ultimately make use of a fast SAT solver to handle complex formulas. Decision procedures for more complicated theories, like linear real and integer arithmetic, are also used in program verification. Most of them use powerful SAT solvers in an essential way. Clearly, efficient SAT solving is a key technology for 21st century computer science. I expect this collection of papers on all theoretical and practical aspects of SAT solving will be extremely useful to both students and researchers and will lead to many further advances in the field.'

  abstract = {This article deals with feasibility issues of the hydro-unit commitment relative to units along a valley in the price-taker revenue-maximizing setting. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming model. Besides physical constraints, we consider two additional specifications that apply to a subset of units and reservoirs within a valley, namely the power-flow curves of each unit feature discrete operational points and each reservoir level should meet target volumes. These specifications, together with the standard issues affecting real-world data, make our problem harder to solve, often infeasible. We follow a step-by-step approach to identify and repair one source of infeasibility at a time, namely numerical errors and model infeasibilities. The former is analyzed and fixed through tools like an exact solver and a model and data preprocessing. The remaining infeasibilities are eliminated with a 2-stage method. In the first stage, a minimal deviation from target volumes, i.e., strategic, thus relaxable, constraints, is computed to make the problem feasible. In the second stage, the original problem is solved with a possible deviation from the target volumes as defined in the first stage. Computational results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method to recover feasibility on a challenging real-world test set.}

In the Boolean satisfiability community, proof-logging is the standard solution for generating trustworthy outputs, and this has become key to the social acceptability of computer-generated proofs. However, reusing this technology for constraint programming requires either much weaker propagation, or an impractical blowup in proof length. This paper demonstrates that simple, clean, and efficient proof logging is still possible for the all-different constraint, through pseudo-Boolean reasoning. We explain how such proofs can be expressed and verified mechanistically, describe an implementation, and discuss the broader implications for proof logging in constraint programming.&lt;/p&gt;},

abstract = {Lifted cover inequalities are well-known cutting planes for 0–1 linear programs. We show how one of the earliest lifting procedures, due to Balas, can be significantly improved. The resulting procedure has some unusual properties. For example, (i) it can yield facet-defining inequalities even if the given cover is not minimal, (ii) it can yield facet-defining inequalities that cannot be obtained by standard lifting procedures, and (iii) the associated superadditive lifting function is integer-valued almost everywhere.}

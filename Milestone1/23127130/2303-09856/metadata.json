    "abstract": "\\begin{abstract} Using the Keeton and Petters approach, we determine the deflection angle. We also investigate the motion of photons around a parameterized black hole in the presence of non-magnetized cold plasma by using a new ray-tracing algorithm. In spherically symmetric spacetime, we examine the influence of the plasma by applying the Hamiltonian equation on the deflection angle as well as shadow. It is examine to derive the rays analytically from Hamilton's equation by separating the metric and the plasma frequency. We study that the presence of plasma affects the deflection angle as well as shadow for the parameterized black hole and they depend on plasma frequency. If the plasma frequency is significantly lower than the photon frequency, the photon sphere and shadow radius expressions can be linearized around the values found for space light rays. Furthermore, we have graphically analyze the behavior of shadow for distinct positions under the effects of plasma frequency as well as low density plasma medium.",

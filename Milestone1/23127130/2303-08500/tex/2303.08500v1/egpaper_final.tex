%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
   Protecting personal data against the exploitation of machine learning models is of paramount importance.
   Recently, availability attacks have shown great promise to provide an extra layer of protection against the unauthorized use of data to train neural networks.
   These methods aim to add imperceptible noise to clean data so that the neural networks cannot extract meaningful patterns from the protected data, claiming that they can make personal data ``unexploitable.''
   In this paper, we provide a strong countermeasure against such approaches, showing that unexploitable data might only be an illusion.
   In particular, we leverage the power of diffusion models and show that a carefully designed denoising process can defuse the ramifications of the data-protecting perturbations.
   We rigorously analyze our algorithm, and theoretically prove that the amount of required denoising is directly related to the magnitude of the data-protecting perturbations.
   Our approach, called \textsc{Avatar}, delivers state-of-the-art performance against a suite of recent availability attacks in various scenarios, outperforming adversarial training.
   Our findings call for more research into making personal data unexploitable, showing that this goal is far from over.

%%%%%%%%% INTRODUCTION
\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
Neural networks have achieved great success in various areas of computer vision including object detection~\citep{he2016deep, dosovitskiy2021vit}, semantic segmentation~\citep{zhou2021gmnet, liu2022cmx}, and photo-realistic image/video generation~\citep{karras2020stylegan2, dhariwal2021diffusion, singer2023makeavideo}.
While the efforts of the community in the development of such models cannot be undermined, this unparalleled success would have been impossible without the abundance of data resources available today~\citep{deng2009imagenet, krizhevsky2009learning, russakovsky2015imagenet, lin2014coco}.
In this regard, social media, and the internet in general, provides a platform that can be crawled easily to create massive datasets.
This capability can act both as a blessing and a curse: while the collected data can facilitate learning larger, more accurate neural networks, the users might lose control over protecting their personal data from being exploited.
This issue has raised increasing concerns about misuse of personal data~\citep{hill2019photos, hill2020secretive, birhane2021large}.

Recently, there has been an increasing number of studies on hindering the unauthorized use of personal data for neural network image classifiers~\citep{feng2019con, huang2021emn, yuan2021ntga, fowl2021tap, fu2022remn, yu2022shr, tian2022confoundergan, sandoval2022ar}.
These methods tend to add an imperceptible amount of noise to the clean images so that while the data has the same appearance as the ground-truth, it cannot provide any meaningful patterns for the neural networks to learn.
As a result, such approaches, collectively known as \textit{availability attacks}~\citep{biggio2018wild}, claim that personal image data can be made \textit{unexploitable} for the neural networks~\citep{huang2021emn, yu2022shr}.
While there has been an abundance of research for designing better availability attacks, far too little attention has been paid to counter-attacks that might be employed by adversaries to break such precautionary measures.

Unfortunately, the assumptions of existing availability attacks are far too weak to make the data unexploitable.
Going back to our real-world example of users sharing their photos over their social media, one can clearly see that once the the data has been released, it can still be exploited for training a neural network.
To clarify the real-world application of this regime, consider a corporate entity that aims to train face recognition models by crawling over social media without the consent of the users.
While this unauthorized entity might not have unprotected versions of a particular person's image from his/her social media, they can have a large pre-trained model representing a facial image distribution.
Given this threat model, shown in \Cref{fig:threat_model}, we aim to show that achieving this goal is indeed plausible.

    \caption{The threat model considered in this paper. Availability attacks cannot guarantee to protect all the data that exists over the web.

\end{figure*}

To this end, we show that pre-trained density estimators are powerful tools that can be used to defuse the effects of the data-protecting perturbations, eventually enabling us to exploit protected data.
We utilize the power of diffusion models in representing the image data distributions to show that reverse-engineering unexploitable data is easier than what is thought.
In particular, given a training dataset, we first diffuse the images by adding a controlled amount of Gaussian noise following the forward process of a pre-trained diffusion model.
Then, we denoise the noisy images using the reverse process of the aforementioned model, resulting in a dataset purified from data-protecting perturbations.
Theoretically, using contraction properties of stochastic difference equations we prove that the number of diffusion steps required to cancel the data-protecting perturbations is directly influenced by its norm.
We also empirically show that our approach is surprisingly powerful, being able to deliver the state-of-the-art~(SOTA) performance against a wide variety of recent availability attacks.
Our results demonstrate that in the era of diffusion models, protected personal data might only be an illusion.
Thus, our findings indicate the fragility of \textit{unexploitable data}, calling for more research to protect personal data.

Our contributions can be summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \vspace{-0.5em}
    \item We introduce \textsc{Avatar} as a countermeasure against data availability attacks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that explores the use of diffusion models to circumvent such attacks.
    \vspace{-0.5em}
	\item We show the power of \textsc{Avatar} in breaking availability attacks over five datasets, four architectures, and seven of the most recent availability attacks. \textsc{Avatar} achieves the SOTA performance against availability attacks, outperforming adversarial training.
    \vspace{-0.5em}
    \item Theoretically, we show that the amount of noise needed to diffuse the data-protecting perturbation is directly related to its norm. This result indicates that achieving both goals of availability attacks (data utility and protection) at the same time might be impossible.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%% LITERATURE REVIEW
\section{Related Work}\label{sec:related}
In this section, we review the related work to our approach.
For an extended version, please see~\Cref{sec:related_work_ext}.

\paragraph{Availability Attacks.}
Motivated to address the lack of personal data privacy, recently an emerging type of poisoning attacks known as \textit{availability attacks} have drawn considerable attention.
Unlike previous types of poisoning attacks, availability attacks seek to add imperceptible perturbations to the clean training data with two goals in mind.
First, the added perturbation should be able to protect the underlying data from being exploited by a neural network during training.
Second, the perturbed data should still preserve its normal utility.
To understand these constraints, consider a user sharing their photo over their social media.
While the user wants to protect their photo from unauthorized use of web-crawlers to train a face recognition model~\citep{hill2019photos}~(first constraint), they still wish their photo to appear normal to their audience~(second constraint)~\citep{huang2021emn}.

% In one of the early works in this area, \citet{feng2019con} propose to produce the poisoning perturbations by training an auto-encoder, which aim is to get the lowest performance from an auxiliary classifier.
% Once the auto-encoder has been trained, it can be used to generate data-protecting perturbations for down-stream tasks.
% With a similar spirit, \citet{tian2022confoundergan} train a conditional generative adversarial network~(GAN)~\citep{goodfellow2014gan} to generate the availability attacks' perturbation.
% The training objective is designed to create a spurious correlation between the noisy image and the ground-truth labels.
% As a result, neural network classifiers learn those spurious features during training instead of focusing on the existing patterns in the data for their decision-making.
% In a concurrent work, \citet{yu2022shr} empirically investigate various types of availability attacks and show that almost all of them leverage these spurious features to create a shortcut within neural networks~\citep{geirhos2020shortcut}.
% Motivated by this observation, \citet{yu2022shr} then propose a fast and scalable approach for perturbation generation.
% It is argued that since the models tend to learn shortcuts, it suffices to create linearly-separable perturbations and utilize them as the data-protecting noise.
% Compared to the existing methods, this approach can generate availability attacks for an entire dataset in a few seconds.
% Concurrently, \citet{sandoval2022ar} proposed another approach that generates the random noise independent from the data.
% In this approach, first the beginning rows and columns of each channel is populated with Gaussian noise.
% Then, an autoregressive process is used to find the value of the remaining pixel values.

Concurrently, \citet{sandoval2022ar} proposed another approach that generates the random noise independent from the data.
In this approach, first the beginning rows and columns of each channel are populated with Gaussian noise.
Then, an autoregressive process is used to find the value of the remaining pixel values.

Another popular approach to generate availability attacks is via direct optimization.
\citet{huang2021emn} defines a bi-level optimization objective to generate error-minimizing noise for data samples and an auxiliary classifier.
It is argued that since the perturbed images minimize the auxiliary classifier's loss, they contain no useful information for any other target classifier to learn, and as such, the model would not exploit them during training.
In contrast, \citet{fowl2021tap} show that using adversarial examples~\citep{szegedy2014intriguing, goodfellow2014explaining} as the poisoned data would make it hard for the classifier to learn any meaningful pattern, and thus, they can serve as a powerful family of availability attacks.
While optimization-based availability attacks are potent, they are often computationally demanding and several attempts have been made to ease their computational burden~\citep{fowl2021preventing, zhang2021data}.

Compared to various types of availability attacks, preventative measures have received little attention.
It has been shown that various data augmentation techniques~(such as CutOut~\citep{devries2017cutout}, Mixup~\citep{zhang2018mixup}, CutMix~\citep{yun2019cutmix}, and Fast Auto-augment~\citep{lim2019autoaugment}) are not able to prevent availability attacks~\citep{huang2021emn, fowl2021tap, tian2022confoundergan, yu2022shr}.
\citet{tao2021preventing} shows that adversarial training~\citep{madry2018towards,zhang2019trades,dolatabadi2022ellinf}, originally proposed to enhance robustness against adversarial attacks~\citep{szegedy2014intriguing, goodfellow2014explaining}, can be used to train successful classifiers against availability attacks.
Later, \citet{fu2022remn} extended error-minimizing noise of \citet{huang2021emn} resulting in perturbations that can even prevent adversarial training from learning over the poisoned data.
Despite this, adversarial training has remained the strongest defense baseline against availability attacks.
In this work, we show that one can outperform adversarial training in an attempt to defuse availability attacks.

\paragraph{Diffusion Models.}
Denoising diffusion probabilistic modeling~(DDPM)~\citep{sohl2015deep, ho2020ddpm}~(also known as score-matching networks~\citep{song2019generative, song2020improved, song2021scoresde}) are a family of deep generative models that have achieved the SOTA performance in image~\citep{dhariwal2021diffusion, xu2023stable}, text-to-image~\citep{rombach2022stable}, video~\citep{singer2023makeavideo}, and 3D-object~\citep{poole2023dreamfusion} generation.
Diffusion models generally comprise of a forward and a backward process~\citep{croitoru2022diffusion}.
In the forward process, the model gradually adds noise to the data until it is transformed into Gaussian noise.
The backward process is the reverse of the forward process, where the model tries to gradually transform/denoise a Gaussian vector into a data point.

Diffusion models have been extensively used in various areas.
Closely related to our work, \citet{yoon2021adp} and \citet{nie2022diffpure} have employed diffusion models to increase robustness against adversarial attacks.
\citet{yoon2021adp} use Noise Conditioned Score Networks to denoise the input data via Langevin dynamics before feeding them into the neural network classifier.
Similarly, \citet{nie2022diffpure} utilize the forward and reverse SDEs to add a controlled amount of noise to the data and then denoise them.
Contrary to these methods, in this paper we investigate the capabilities of diffusion models as a threat against personal data protected by availability attacks.
More precisely, unlike adversarial purification which aims to deliver a successful inference, in our scenario we need to denoise the data so that the model can learn meaningful patterns during training.

\subsection{Problem Statement}\label{sec:sec:statement}

Let $\mathcal{D}=\{(\boldsymbol{x}^{(i)}, y^{(i)})\}_{i=1}^{n}$ be a labeled dataset consisting of $n$ i.i.d.~samples~$\boldsymbol{x}^{(i)}$ each with a label $y^{(i)}$.
Without loss of generality, in this paper, we consider image data $\boldsymbol{x}^{(i)} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$ where $d$ shows the data dimension.
Also, we assume that $y^{(i)}$ takes one of the $K$ possible class values~$\{1, 2, \dots, K\}$.
Furthermore, let ${f_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}: \mathbb{R}^{d} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{K}}$ denote a neural network classifier parameterized by ${\boldsymbol{\theta}}$ that takes an image $\boldsymbol{x}$ and outputs a real-valued vector ${\boldsymbol{z} = f_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\boldsymbol{x})}$ known as the logit.
The final decision of the classifier is determined via $\hat{y} = \argmax_{j} {z}_{j}$.
To train the classifier, one usually aims to minimize the empirical error between the ground-truth labels and the classifier predictions:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:empirical_error}
    \argmin_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\mathbb{E}_{(\boldsymbol{x}, y) \in \mathcal{D}}[\ell(f_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\boldsymbol{x}), y)],
\end{equation}
where $\ell(\cdot)$ denotes the cross-entropy loss.

Following the convention in availability attacks, we assume that there exists a data curator that manipulates the dataset $\mathcal{D}$ into ${\mathcal{D}_{\rm pr}=\{(\tilde{\boldsymbol{x}}^{(i)}, y^{(i)})\}_{i=1}^{n}}$ such that once a neural network is trained over $\mathcal{D}_{\rm pr}$, it performs poorly over the clean data~$\mathcal{D}$:
\begin{align}\label{eq:threat_model}\nonumber
    &\argmax_{\mathcal{D}_{\rm pr}} \mathbb{E}_{(\boldsymbol{x}, y) \in \mathcal{D}}[\ell(f_{\boldsymbol{\theta}^{*}}(\boldsymbol{x}), y)]\\
    \text{s.t.}~\boldsymbol{\theta}^{*} &= \argmin_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\mathbb{E}_{(\boldsymbol{x}, y) \in \mathcal{D}_{\rm pr}}[\ell(f_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\boldsymbol{x}), y)].
\end{align}
Since each image $\tilde{\boldsymbol{x}}^{(i)}$ needs to maintain its normal utility, it is assumed that $\tilde{\boldsymbol{x}}^{(i)} = \boldsymbol{x}^{(i)} + \boldsymbol{\delta}^{(i)}$.
Here, $\boldsymbol{\delta}^{(i)}$'s are the data-protecting perturbations such that $\norm{\boldsymbol{\delta}^{(i)}}_{p} \leq \varepsilon$, where $\norm{\cdot}_{p}$ denotes the $L_p$ norm.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{dAta aVailAbiliTy Attacks defuseR~(\textsc{Avatar})}\label{sec:avatar}
As discussed, large pre-trained generative models can pose a threat to availability attacks and personal data protection.
In this section, we show how diffusion models, which are the SOTA in image generation, can be leveraged to cancel out the effects of availability attacks.

Recall that availability attacks provide a manipulated version of the original data~$\boldsymbol{x}$ that is seemingly unexploitable.
At the same time, the protected image~$\tilde{\boldsymbol{x}} = \boldsymbol{x} + \boldsymbol{\delta}$ should have its normal utility as it is going to be used by the users, e.g., to post over their social media.
This condition reflects itself through the constraint that $\norm{\boldsymbol{\delta}}_{p} \leq \varepsilon$.

A trivial idea would be to add noise to the protected data such that the effects of the data-protecting perturbations are cancelled. 
However, simply making the data noisy would be detrimental to its training utility~\citep{huang2021emn}.
As such, we propose to use a diffusion model for denoising as outlined next.\footnote{Note that while here we use DDPMs\citep{ho2020ddpm} to demonstrate our method, it can be easily extended to other types of diffusion models as they are all different ways of representing the same process~\citep{song2021scoresde}.}

Specifically, let us assume that we have a pre-trained DDPM~\citep{ho2020ddpm} model that represents the data distribution~$\boldsymbol{x}_0 \sim p_{\rm data}(\boldsymbol{x})$.
The forward process of this model is represented using a Markov chain of length $T$, such that:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:forward_process}
    \boldsymbol{x}_{t} = \sqrt{1 - \beta_{t}} \boldsymbol{x}_{t-1} + \sqrt{\beta_{t}} \boldsymbol{\epsilon}_{t},
\end{equation}
where $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_{t} \sim \mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{0}, \mathbf{I})$ is the normal distribution, and ${t=1, 2, \dots, T}$. 
The constants $\beta_{t}$, known as variance schedules, are selected such that $\boldsymbol{x}_{T} \sim \mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{0}, \mathbf{I})$.
As can be seen, the forward process in \Cref{eq:forward_process} gradually adds noise to the data until it is transformed into Gaussian noise.
If we set ${\alpha_{t}:=\prod_{s=1}^t\left(1-\beta_{s}\right)}$, then this Markov process can also be performed via a single step~\citep{ho2020ddpm}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:forward_process_2}
    \boldsymbol{x}_{t} =  \sqrt{\alpha_{t}} \boldsymbol{x}_{0} + \sqrt{1 - \alpha_{t}} \boldsymbol{\epsilon}.
\end{equation}
The reverse of this process is also a variational Markov chain which is represented by:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:reverse_process}
    \boldsymbol{x}_{t-1}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\beta_{t}}}\left(\boldsymbol{x}_{t}+\beta_{t} \mathbf{s}_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\boldsymbol{x}_{t}, t)\right)+\sqrt{\beta_{t}} \boldsymbol{\epsilon}_{t}.
\end{equation}
Here, $\mathbf{s}_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\cdot, t)$ is a network parameterized by $\boldsymbol{\phi}$ representing the score of the noisy data distribution at scale~$t$~\citep{song2021scoresde}.

To cancel the effects of the data-protecting perturbations, we propose to first add Gaussian noise to the data.
The amount of noise should be adjusted in a way that each image maintains its visual appearance.
Otherwise, the semantic information of each image would be lost, and since the reverse process is probabilistic, the original image might not be recovered.

In particular, let $\tilde{\boldsymbol{x}}$ be a protected image.
We perform the forward process up to a step $t^{*} < T$ such that the semantic information of the image is preserved:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:noise_addition}
    \bar{\boldsymbol{x}}_{t^{*}} =  \sqrt{\alpha_{t^{*}}} \tilde{\boldsymbol{x}} + \sqrt{1 - \alpha_{t^{*}}} \boldsymbol{\epsilon}.
\end{equation}
Now, we have managed to diminish the effects of the data-protecting perturbation in $\boldsymbol{x}_{t^{*}}$.
However, this way we would also damage the semantic features of the data which makes it hard to train a neural network model~(see the ablation study in~\Cref{fig:timestep}).
To revert to the normal image space, we use the reverse process of our diffusion model to denoise the data:
\begin{align}\label{eq:denoising}
    \bar{\boldsymbol{x}}_{t-1}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\beta_{t}}}\left(\bar{\boldsymbol{x}}_{t}+\beta_{t} \mathbf{s}_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\bar{\boldsymbol{x}}_{t}, t)\right)+\sqrt{\beta_{t}} \boldsymbol{\epsilon}_{t}.
\end{align}
Recursively solving \Cref{eq:denoising} from $t^{*}$ to $1$, we get a denoised version of the data which we denote by~${\bar{\boldsymbol{x}} = \bar{\boldsymbol{x}}_0}$.
Using this process, shown in \Cref{fig:avatar}, we denoise the entire dataset $\mathcal{D}_{\rm pr}$, and construct a new one ${\mathcal{D}_{\rm de} = \{(\bar{\boldsymbol{x}}^{(i)}, y^{(i)})\}}$ for neural network training.
\Cref{alg:avatar} shows our final algorithm for training a neural network using \textsc{Avatar}.

\subsection{Setting $t^{*}$ in \textsc{Avatar}}\label{sec:sec:setting_t}

So far, we discussed how by adding controlled a amount of Gaussian noise through the forward diffusion process we can nullify the effects of the data-protecting perturbations.
Here, we take a theoretical perspective on our proposed solution, \textsc{Avatar}.
Specifically, the following theorem indicates that canceling perturbations with a larger magnitude requires adding more noise.
This, however, comes at the cost of greater distortion in the final, denoised image which makes it harder to learn a classifier.
As a result, care must be taken when setting the forward diffusion step~$t^{*}$.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:convergence}
    Let $\boldsymbol{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$ denote a clean image and ${\tilde{\boldsymbol{x}} = \boldsymbol{x} + \boldsymbol{\delta}}$ its protected version.
    Also, let $\bar{\boldsymbol{x}}_{0}$ be the sanitized image using the \textsc{Avatar} denoising process given in \Cref{eq:noise_addition,eq:denoising}.
    If we set $t^{*}$ such that
    $$2\log\left(\frac{2\norm{\boldsymbol{\delta}}^{2} + 4d}{\mu \Delta}\right) \leq t^{*} \beta_{t^{*}} \leq \frac{\mu \Delta}{4d},$$
    then the estimation error between the sanitized $\bar{\boldsymbol{x}}_{0}$ and clean image $\boldsymbol{x}$ can be bounded as:
    $$\mathbb{E}\left[\norm{\bar{\boldsymbol{x}}_{0} - \boldsymbol{x}}^2\right] \leq 2(\mu + 1)\Delta,$$
    where $\Delta = \mathbb{E}[\norm{\boldsymbol{x}_0 - \boldsymbol{x}}^{2}]$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    See \Cref{sec:proofs} for our proof based on the contraction property of stochastic difference equations~\citep{pham2008analysis}.
\end{proof}

As \Cref{thm:convergence} states, for a protected image with a larger perturbation norm $\norm{\boldsymbol{\delta}}$, a larger amount of noise~(determined by~$t^{*} \beta_{t^{*}}$) is required.
However, the amount of noise cannot be arbitrarily large as the semantic information of the image might be lost in the process~(as indicated by the presence of $\Delta$ in the upper-bound).

From the perspective of availability attacks, this result indicates that for a better data protection against \textsc{Avatar}, we need larger perturbation norms.
However, enlarging the perturbation is in contradiction with retaining data utility which is the ultimate aim of availability attacks as discussed in \Cref{sec:avatar}.
This means that the conditions of availability attacks might be in contradiction with each other.
We leave the further investigation of this line of research to future work.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{\textsc{Avatar} vs.~Adversarial Training}\label{sec:discussion}

As~\citet{tao2021preventing} have demonstrated, adversarial training~(AT)~\citep{madry2018towards} could also be used to train successful models over unexploitable data.
However, our approach has several key advantages compared to AT:
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]\setlength\itemsep{-0.5pt}
        \item First, AT modifies the learning algorithm, and as such, it needs to be applied separately for training each neural network.
        In contrast, \textsc{Avatar} sanitizes the data only \textit{once}. Once the data is purified, it can be used for training as many neural networks as wanted.
        As a result, \textsc{Avatar} is more efficient.
        \item Second, as shown by \citet{tsipras2019robustness}, AT might sacrifice the clean accuracy in its learning process, and as such, might not be the ultimate method for defending against availability attacks.
        \item Lastly, as \citet{fu2022remn} show, one can build unexploitable data against AT that would essentially render AT vulnerable to availability attacks.
\end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%% EXPERIMENTS
\section{Experimental Results}\label{sec:experiments}

\paragraph{Settings.}
For our experiments, we consider four standard datasets: CIFAR-10 \& 100~\citep{krizhevsky2009learning}, SVHN~\citep{netzer2011svhn}, and a subset of ImageNet~(IN)~\citep{russakovsky2015imagenet} with 100 classes.
Using seven SOTA availability attacks, including DeepConfuse~(CON)~\citep{feng2019con}, Neural Tangent Generalization Attacks~(NTGA)~\citep{yuan2021ntga}, Error-minimizing Noise~(EMN)~\citep{huang2021emn}, Targeted Adversarial Poisoning~(TAP)~\citep{fowl2021tap}, Robust EMN~(REMN)~\citep{fu2022remn}, Shortcut~(SHR)~\citep{geirhos2020shortcut}, and Autoregressive attacks~(AR)~\citep{sandoval2022ar} we create a protected version of the above-mentioned datasets.\footnote{{For CON~\citep{feng2019con} \& AR~\citep{sandoval2022ar}, we only use their officially released data.}}
Then, we use \textsc{Avatar} to sanitize the training set.
To this end, we use pre-trained diffusion models (score-SDE~\citep{song2021scoresde} for CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN, guided DDPM~\citep{dhariwal2021diffusion} for ImageNet) to denoise the protected data.
The Fréchet Inception Distance~(FID)~\citep{heusel2017fid} of the models used for denoising is given in~\Cref{tab:FID} of the Appendix.
After the denoising process is done, we train neural network classifiers over the denoised dataset and compare their performance against the protected training.
We use several neural network architectures such as ResNet-18~(RN-18)~\citep{he2016deep}, VGG-16~\citep{simonyan2015vgg}, DenseNet-121~(DN-121)~\citep{huang2017densenet}, and WideResNet-34~(WRN-34)~\citep{zagoruyko2016wresnet} as our classifier.
For a detailed account of our settings, please see~\Cref{sec:settings}.
Here, we only present our results for RN-18 models, and the extended version of our results for other architectures can be found in~\Cref{sec:ext_experiments}.

\paragraph{Exploiting Protected Data.}
\Cref{tab:architecture} shows our results for breaking availability attacks against RN-18 models for four different datasets.
As can be seen, \textsc{Avatar} can significantly improve the performance of neural network training in almost all cases.
Moreover, although the training data was produced using diffusion models, the trained neural networks can generalize to unseen test data easily.
This trend is more evident in the CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets where the pre-trained diffusion model can better represent the image data density, as indicated by their low FID scores.
Our results also indicate that the SHR~\citep{yu2022shr} method is a simple yet powerful method that can resist our approach more than any other type of availability attack.
For more details, please see~\Cref{sec:ext_experiments}.

\paragraph{Comparison with Data Augmentation Techniques.}
\textsc{Avatar} can be regarded as a type of data pre-processing where the inner mechanics of the learning algorithms are not modified.
As such, here we compare our approach with various SOTA data augmentation techniques that can be utilized during model training.
To this end, we follow the settings of \citep{huang2021emn}, and adopt four widely used data augmentation techniques. 
\Cref{tab:data_aug} shows the performance of these approaches compared to \textsc{Avatar}.
As shown, our approach outperforms various types of data augmentation.

\end{figure*}

\paragraph{The Effect of Early Stopping.}
It has been previously shown that early stopping can also be beneficial against availability attacks~\citep{huang2021emn}.
As such, here we run the same set of experiments over availability attacks for the CIFAR-10 dataset, but this time we record the highest accuracy attainable during training.
\Cref{tab:early} shows our results.
As seen, using our approach one achieves stable training, where the variance between the final model accuracy and the highest attainable accuracy is very low.
Notably, while these results indicate that existing availability attacks are less powerful than what is thought, early stopping is not sufficient to recover the best model performance.
In contrast, our approach can significantly cancel the effects of availability attacks.

\paragraph{Comparison with Adversarial Training.}
As mentioned in \Cref{sec:related}, adversarial training~(AT)~\citep{madry2018towards} is the most successful defense technique against availability attacks~\citep{tao2021preventing}.
For the next set of experiments, we follow the settings of \citet{fu2022remn} and compare our approach with AT.
To this end, we run two different scenarios.
First, we perform AT over the protected data.
Then, we run AT over the data that is defused by \textsc{Avatar}.
In both cases, we vary the perturbation bound $\varepsilon$ from 0 to 4, where 0 is the vanilla training.
\Cref{fig:at_rn18} shows our results.
Apart from what we discussed in \Cref{sec:discussion}, two additional insights are worth mentioning here:
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]\setlength\itemsep{-0.5pt}
        \item In most cases, \textsc{Avatar} without AT~(i.e.,~${\varepsilon = 0}$) performs on-par or better than AT with ${\varepsilon > 0}$.
        Thus, \textsc{Avatar} delivers the SOTA against availability attacks.
        \item As seen in \Cref{fig:at_rn18}, AT yields the worst performance against REMN~\citep{fu2022remn}.
        However, our approach can combat REMN~\citep{fu2022remn} successfully, and it is the first approach that does so.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Setting Diffusion Step $t^{*}$.}
As discussed in \Cref{sec:sec:setting_t}, setting the diffusion timestep should be performed carefully.
Otherwise, either the data-protecting noise is not eliminated, or the semantic information of the image is lost.
In this section, we run an ablation study over the diffusion timestep.
In particular, for our CIFAR-10 experiments, we run \textsc{Avatar} with five different timesteps from ${\{0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4\}}$.
Then, we measure the test accuracy of the trained neural networks over the clean test set.
As shown in~\Cref{fig:timestep}, setting $t^{*}$ too small means that the data-protecting perturbations are not removed.
In contrast, setting $t^{*}$ to a large value might remove of the semantic information which in turn damages the generalizability of the trained model.

    \vspace{-0.25 in}
\end{table*}

\paragraph{Distribution Mismatch.}
Next, we show that \textsc{Avatar} is somehow resilient to a distribution mismatch between the diffusion model and the training data.
In particular, we train three diffusion models over the protected CIFAR-10 dataset with TAP~\citep{fowl2021tap}, IN-10 which contains 10 classes of ImageNet that are most similar to CIFAR-10 dataset~\citep{huang2021emn}~(see \Cref{tab:imagenet10} for more details), and CIFAR-100.
Then, we use these surrogate distributions to sanitize protected CIFAR-10 data and train a neural network over the denoised data.
We report our results in \Cref{tab:dist_mismatch}.
Surprisingly, our approach can tolerate the distribution mismatch to some extent.
As the diffusion model density gets closer to the true training data, the performance gap is gradually closed.
Interestingly, even using a diffusion model that is trained over protected data can be beneficial in removing the effects of availability attacks.
Note that according to our threat model discussed in~\Cref{fig:threat_model}, this case is too extreme, meaning that the data protector needs to add a perturbation to all the data on the web which is almost impossible.

	\label{fig:timestep}
    \vspace{-0.2 in}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{A Real-world Example.}
As for a real-world example of \textsc{Avatar}, we use the facial recognition example given in \citet{huang2021emn}.
As discussed in \Cref{fig:threat_model}, although an online exploiter might not have access to the unprotected photos of a social media user, they can use large pre-trained models to defuse the data-protecting perturbations.
Here, we follow the settings of~\citet{huang2021emn} and aim to train a facial recognition classifier over the WebFace dataset~\citep{yi2014}.
Like \citet{huang2021emn}, we assume that 50 users are protecting photos using availability attacks, and the rest of the 10522 identities in the WebFace dataset are intact.
To make this scenario close to a real-world case, we assume that the unauthorized entity in \Cref{fig:threat_model} does not have access to the WebFace data and the underlying diffusion model was trained over CelebA~\citep{liu2015deep} only.
Then, the exploiter denoises the protected data before training a facial recognition model with InceptionResNet architecture~\citep{szegedy2017inception}.
Our results are given in~\Cref{fig:webface_emn}.
As seen, \textsc{Avatar} can significantly enhance the performance of the protected classes.
This endorses our claim that in the era of diffusion models, protecting personal data is challenging and requires further efforts to achieve it.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we introduced a countermeasure against data protection algorithms that use availability attacks.
In particular, we show that by adding a controlled amount of Gaussian noise to the images and subsequently denoising them one can eliminate data-protecting perturbations.
To this end, we use the forward and reverse diffusion processes of pre-trained models.
We theoretically analyze our approach and show that the amount of Gaussian noise required to defuse the data-protecting perturbations is directly related to their norm.
We conduct extensive experiments over various availability attacks.
Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to adversarial training, setting a new SOTA defense against availability attacks.
\textsc{Avatar} demonstrates brittleness of availability attacks and calls for more research to protect personal data.

%%%%%%%%% Proofs
\section{Proofs}\label{sec:proofs}
Here we provide our proof for \Cref{thm:convergence}.
First, we provide the theoretical results that would be used in our proof.
Then, we re-state \Cref{thm:convergence} and provide its detailed proof.
Our proofs heavily borrow from the contraction properties of stochastic difference equations~\citep{pham2008analysis, pham2009concentration, chung2022come}.

\begin{theorem}[Discrete stochastic contraction~\citep{pham2008analysis, chung2022come}]\label{thm:contraction}
    Let
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:sde}
        \boldsymbol{x}_{t-1}=\mathbf{h}(\boldsymbol{x}_t, t)+\sigma(\boldsymbol{x}_t, t) \boldsymbol{\epsilon}_t,
    \end{equation}
    denote a stochastic difference equation where:
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]\setlength\itemsep{-0.5pt}
        \item $\mathbf{h}: \mathbb{R}^{d} \times \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{d}$ is a contraction mapping, i.e., for every $t \in \mathbb{N}$ there exists a $\lambda_{t} \in [0, 1)$ such that
        \begin{equation}\label{eq:contraction}
            \norm{\mathbf{h}(\boldsymbol{x}, t) - \mathbf{h}(\boldsymbol{y}, t)} \leq \lambda_{t} \norm{\boldsymbol{x} - \boldsymbol{y}} \quad \forall~\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{y} \in \mathbb{R}^{d},
        \end{equation}
        \item $\sigma: \mathbb{R}^{d} \times \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a function such that for every $t \in \mathbb{N}$ and $\boldsymbol{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$
        \begin{equation}\label{eq:trace}
            \mathrm{Tr}\big(\sigma(\boldsymbol{x}, t)\mathbf{I}\sigma(\boldsymbol{x}, t)\big) \leq C_{t},
        \end{equation}
        \item and $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_t \sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{I})$.
    \end{enumerate}
    Then, for two sample trajectories $\boldsymbol{x}_{t-1}$ and $\bar{\boldsymbol{x}}_{t-1}$ that satisfy \Cref{eq:sde} we have:
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:sde_contraction}
        \mathbb{E}\left[\norm{\boldsymbol{x}_{t-1}-\bar{\boldsymbol{x}}_{t-1}}^2\right] \leq \lambda_{t}^{2}~\mathbb{E}\left[\norm{\boldsymbol{x}_{t}-\bar{\boldsymbol{x}}_{t}}^2\right] + 2 C_{t}.
    \end{equation}
\end{theorem}

Using \Cref{thm:contraction} and \Cref{eq:reverse_process} we can get the following result~\citep{chung2022come}.

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:ddpm_contraction}
    The reverse diffusion process of DDPMs are contracting stochastic difference equations.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
    Our proof closely follows that of \citet{chung2022come}.
    Specifically, we need to show that for the reverse diffusion process given in \Cref{eq:reverse_process}, the conditions of \Cref{eq:contraction,eq:trace} hold.
    To show this, note that if we set:
    $${\mathbf{h}(\boldsymbol{x}_t, t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\beta_{t}}}\left(\boldsymbol{x}_{t}+\beta_{t} \mathbf{s}_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\boldsymbol{x}_{t}, t)\right)}$$
    and
    $$\sigma(\boldsymbol{x}_t, t) = \sqrt{\beta_{t}}$$
    then \Cref{eq:reverse_process,eq:sde} coincide.
    Using Lemma A.1.~from \citet{chung2022come}, one can show that for
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:lambda_t}
        \lambda_{t} = \sqrt{1 - \beta_{t}} \frac{1-\alpha_{t-1}}{1-\alpha_{t}}
    \end{equation}
    and
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:C_t}
        C_{t} = d \beta_{t}
    \end{equation}
    the conditions of \Cref{eq:contraction,eq:trace} are satisfied.
    As such, for two reverse sample trajectories $\boldsymbol{x}_{t-1}$ and $\bar{\boldsymbol{x}}_{t-1}$ that satisfy the reverse diffusion process of \Cref{eq:reverse_process}, \Cref{eq:sde_contraction} holds. 
\end{proof}
Next, we present two lemmas that are going to be used in our proof of \Cref{thm:convergence}.

\begin{lemma}[\citep{chung2022come}]\label{lem:exp}
    For $\lambda_t$'s given in \Cref{eq:lambda_t} the following holds:
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:exp}
        \prod_{s=1}^{t^{*}} \lambda_{s}^{2} \leq \exp({-\frac{t^{*}\beta_{t^{*}}}{2}}).
    \end{equation}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    See Lemma~C.1.~in~\citep{chung2022come}.
\end{proof}
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:mean}
    For two random vectors $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ we have:
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:mean}
        \mathbb{E}\left[\norm{\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{y}}^2\right] \leq 2~\mathbb{E}\left[\norm{\mathbf{x}}^2\right] + 2~\mathbb{E}\left[\norm{\mathbf{y}}^2\right].
    \end{equation}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    We know that:
    \begin{align}\nonumber
        \mathbb{E}\left[\norm{\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{y}}^2\right] &= \mathbb{E}\left[\norm{\mathbf{x}}^2\right] + \mathbb{E}\left[\norm{\mathbf{y}}^2\right] + 2~\mathbb{E}\left[\mathbf{x}^\top\mathbf{y}\right]\\\nonumber
        & \leq 2~\mathbb{E}\left[\norm{\mathbf{x}}^2\right] + 2~\mathbb{E}\left[\norm{\mathbf{y}}^2\right],
    \end{align}
    where the last inequality follows from the fact that $\mathbb{E}\left[\norm{\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}}^2\right] \geq 0$.
\end{proof}

We are now ready to prove our theoretical result.

\begin{customthm}{1}[restated]\label{thm:convergence:rep}
    Let $\boldsymbol{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$ denote a clean image and $\tilde{\boldsymbol{x}} = \boldsymbol{x} + \boldsymbol{\delta}$ its protected version.
    Also, let $\bar{\boldsymbol{x}}_{0}$ be the sanitized image using the \textsc{Avatar} denoising process given in \Cref{eq:noise_addition,eq:denoising}.
    If we set $t^{*}$ such that
    $$2\log\left(\frac{2\norm{\boldsymbol{\delta}}^{2} + 4d}{\mu \Delta}\right) \leq t^{*} \beta_{t^{*}} \leq \frac{\mu \Delta}{4d},$$
    then the estimation error between the sanitized $\bar{\boldsymbol{x}}_{0}$ and clean image $\boldsymbol{x}$ can be bounded as:
    $$\mathbb{E}\left[\norm{\bar{\boldsymbol{x}}_{0} - \boldsymbol{x}}^2\right] \leq 2(\mu + 1)\Delta,$$
    where $\Delta = \mathbb{E}[\norm{\boldsymbol{x}_0 - \boldsymbol{x}}^{2}]$.
\end{customthm}
\begin{proof}
    We are looking to find an upper-bound for the estimation error between the sanitized image and its clean version.
    Using \Cref{lem:mean} we can write:
    \begin{align}\label{eq:addition}\nonumber
        \mathbb{E}\left[\norm{\bar{\boldsymbol{x}}_{0} - \boldsymbol{x}}^2\right] &= \mathbb{E}\left[\norm{(\bar{\boldsymbol{x}}_{0} - \boldsymbol{x}_0) + (\boldsymbol{x}_0 - \boldsymbol{x})}^2\right]\\\nonumber
        & \leq 2~\mathbb{E}\left[\norm{\bar{\boldsymbol{x}}_{0} - \boldsymbol{x}_0}^2\right] + 2~\mathbb{E}\left[\norm{\boldsymbol{x}_0 - \boldsymbol{x}}^2\right]\\
        & \leq 2~\mathbb{E}\left[\norm{\bar{\boldsymbol{x}}_{0} - \boldsymbol{x}_0}^2\right] + 2~\Delta.
    \end{align}
    Now, we need to find an upper-bound for the first term.
    To this end, we are going to use the contraction property of the DDPMs~(\Cref{cor:ddpm_contraction}).
    In particular, given the noisy versions of the clean $\boldsymbol{x}$ and the protected image $\tilde{\boldsymbol{x}} = \boldsymbol{x} + \boldsymbol{\delta}$, in other words:
    \begin{align}\label{eq:forward_addition}\nonumber
        \boldsymbol{x}_{t^{*}} &= \sqrt{\alpha_{t^{*}}} \boldsymbol{x} + \sqrt{1 - \alpha_{t^{*}}} \boldsymbol{\epsilon}_0
        \\
        \bar{\boldsymbol{x}}_{t^{*}} &= \sqrt{\alpha_{t^{*}}} \tilde{\boldsymbol{x}} + \sqrt{1 - \alpha_{t^{*}}} \boldsymbol{\epsilon}_0',
    \end{align}
    we know that both $\boldsymbol{x}_0$ and $\bar{\boldsymbol{x}}_0$ satisfy the reverse diffusion process, or:
    \begin{align}\label{eq:reverse_addition}\nonumber
        \boldsymbol{x}_{t-1}&=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\beta_{t}}}\left(\boldsymbol{x}_{t}+\beta_{t} \mathbf{s}_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\boldsymbol{x}_{t}, t)\right)+\sqrt{\beta_{t}} \boldsymbol{\epsilon}_{t}
        \\
        \bar{\boldsymbol{x}}_{t-1}&=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\beta_{t}}}\left(\bar{\boldsymbol{x}}_{t}+\beta_{t} \mathbf{s}_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\bar{\boldsymbol{x}}_{t}, t)\right)+\sqrt{\beta_{t}} \boldsymbol{\epsilon}_{t}', \quad \forall~t \in \{1, 2, \dots, t^{*}\},
    \end{align}
    where $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_{t}, \boldsymbol{\epsilon}_{t}' \sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{I})$.
    As such, we can treat $\boldsymbol{x}_0$ and $\bar{\boldsymbol{x}}_0$ as two sample trajectories of the same stochastic difference equation.
    Thus, by recursively applying \Cref{eq:sde_contraction} we would get:
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:contraction_cumulative}
        \mathbb{E}\left[\norm{\bar{\boldsymbol{x}}_{0}-\boldsymbol{x}_{0}}^2\right] \leq \textcolor{red}{\mathbb{E}\left[\norm{\bar{\boldsymbol{x}}_{t^{*}}-\boldsymbol{x}_{t^{*}}}^2\right]} \textcolor{blue}{\prod_{s=1}^{t^{*}}\lambda_{s}^{2}}+ \textcolor{darkgreen}{2 \sum_{s=1}^{t^{*}}C_{s} \prod_{r=1}^{s-1}\lambda_{r}^{2}}.
    \end{equation}
    Now, let us consider each term on the RHS of \Cref{eq:contraction_cumulative} separately.
    For the \textcolor{red}{red} term, we can write:
    \begin{align}\label{eq:red_term_1}\nonumber
        \textcolor{red}{\mathbb{E}\left[\norm{\bar{\boldsymbol{x}}_{t^{*}}-\boldsymbol{x}_{t^{*}}}^2\right]} &\stackrel{\mathrm{(1)}}{=} \mathbb{E}\left[\norm{\sqrt{\alpha_{t^{*}}} (\tilde{\boldsymbol{x}}-\boldsymbol{x}) + \sqrt{1 - \alpha_{t^{*}}} (\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_0'-\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_0)}^2\right] \\\nonumber
        &\stackrel{\mathrm{(2)}}{=} \mathbb{E}\left[\norm{\sqrt{\alpha_{t^{*}}} \boldsymbol{\delta} + \sqrt{1 - \alpha_{t^{*}}} (\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_0'-\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_0)}^2\right]\\\nonumber
        &= \norm{\sqrt{\alpha_{t^{*}}} \boldsymbol{\delta}}^2 + \mathbb{E}\left[\norm{\sqrt{1 - \alpha_{t^{*}}} (\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_0'-\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_0)}^2\right] + 2 \sqrt{\alpha_{t^{*}}}\sqrt{1 - \alpha_{t^{*}}} \boldsymbol{\delta}^\top\mathbb{E}\left[\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_0'-\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_0\right]\\
        &\stackrel{\mathrm{(3)}}{=} \alpha_{t^{*}}\norm{\boldsymbol{\delta}}^2 + (1 - \alpha_{t^{*}})\mathbb{E}\left[\norm{(\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_0'-\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_0)}^2\right].
    \end{align}
    where (1) is derived from \Cref{eq:forward_addition}, (2) holds since $\tilde{\boldsymbol{x}} = \boldsymbol{x} + \boldsymbol{\delta}$, and (3) is valid as $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_{0}, \boldsymbol{\epsilon}_{0}' \sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{I})$.
    Given that:
    $$\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_{0}' - \boldsymbol{\epsilon}_{0} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0}, 2\mathbf{I}),$$
    we can simplify \Cref{eq:red_term_1} as:
    $$
        \textcolor{red}{\mathbb{E}\left[\norm{\bar{\boldsymbol{x}}_{t^{*}}-\boldsymbol{x}_{t^{*}}}^2\right]} = \alpha_{t^{*}}\norm{\boldsymbol{\delta}}^2 + 2 (1 - \alpha_{t^{*}})\mathbb{E}\left[\chi\right],
    $$
    where $\chi$ follows the chi-squared distribution with $d$ degrees of freedom.
    Using the fact that $0 < \alpha_{t^{*}} < 1$, we can finally write:
    \begin{align}\label{eq:red_term_final}\nonumber
        \textcolor{red}{\mathbb{E}\left[\norm{\bar{\boldsymbol{x}}_{t^{*}}-\boldsymbol{x}_{t^{*}}}^2\right]}
        &= \alpha_{t^{*}}\norm{\boldsymbol{\delta}}^2 + 2 (1 - \alpha_{t^{*}})d \\ 
        &\leq \norm{\boldsymbol{\delta}}^2 + 2d.
    \end{align}
    Using \Cref{lem:exp}, for the \textcolor{blue}{blue} term in \Cref{eq:contraction_cumulative} we can write:
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:blue_term}
        \textcolor{blue}{\prod_{s=1}^{t^{*}} \lambda_{s}^{2}} \leq \exp({-\frac{t^{*}\beta_{t^{*}}}{2}}).
    \end{equation}
    Finally, for the \textcolor{darkgreen}{green} term we have:
    \begin{align}\label{eq:green_term}\nonumber
        \textcolor{darkgreen}{2 \sum_{s=1}^{t^{*}}C_{s} \prod_{r=1}^{s-1}\lambda_{r}^{2}}
        &\stackrel{\mathrm{(1)}}{=} 2 \sum_{s=1}^{t^{*}}d\beta_s \prod_{r=1}^{s-1}\lambda_{r}^{2} \\\nonumber
        &\stackrel{\mathrm{(2)}}{\leq} 2 \sum_{s=1}^{t^{*}}d\beta_s\\
        &\stackrel{\mathrm{(3)}}{\leq} 2d t^{*}\beta_{t^{*}}.
    \end{align}
    Here, (1) is the result of \Cref{eq:C_t}, (2) holds since $0 < \lambda_r < 1$~(see~\Cref{eq:lambda_t}), and (3) is derived from ${0 < \beta_{1} < \cdots < \beta_{t} < 1}$.

    Putting \Cref{eq:red_term_final,eq:blue_term,eq:green_term} together, we have:
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:contraction_cumulative_simplified}
        \mathbb{E}\left[\norm{\bar{\boldsymbol{x}}_{0}-\boldsymbol{x}_{0}}^2\right] \leq \left(\norm{\boldsymbol{\delta}}^2 + 2d\right) \exp({-\frac{t^{*}\beta_{t^{*}}}{2}}) + 2d t^{*}\beta_{t^{*}}.
    \end{equation}
    Given that:
    $$2\log\left(\frac{2\norm{\boldsymbol{\delta}}^{2} + 4d}{\mu \Delta}\right) \leq t^{*} \beta_{t^{*}} \leq \frac{\mu \Delta}{4d},$$
    we can simplify \Cref{eq:contraction_cumulative_simplified} as:
    \begin{align}\label{eq:contraction_cumulative_final}\nonumber
        \mathbb{E}\left[\norm{\bar{\boldsymbol{x}}_{0}-\boldsymbol{x}_{0}}^2\right] &\leq \left(\norm{\boldsymbol{\delta}}^2 + 2d\right) \exp({-\frac{t^{*}\beta_{t^{*}}}{2}}) + 2d t^{*}\beta_{t^{*}}\\\nonumber
        &\leq \left(\norm{\boldsymbol{\delta}}^2 + 2d\right)\frac{\mu \Delta}{2\norm{\boldsymbol{\delta}}^{2} + 4d} + 2d \frac{\mu \Delta}{4d}\\
        &\leq \mu \Delta.
    \end{align}
    Replacing \Cref{eq:contraction_cumulative_final} into \Cref{eq:addition}, the proof can be completed.
\end{proof}

\section{Extended Related Work}\label{sec:related_work_ext}
In this section, we provide the rest of our related work that was omitted due to space limits.

\paragraph{Poisoning and Attacks.}
A considerable number of studies have been published on various types of \textit{data poisoning attacks}~\citep{biggio2018wild, schwarzschild2021toxic, goldblum2023dataset}.
These attacks aim to pollute the training data so that they can hinder the performance of the machine learning model at test-time~\citep{biggio2012svmbackdoor, koh2017understanding, munozgonzalez2017towards}.
While these methods are quite successful in achieving this goal, they often tend to perform weakly against neural networks~\citep{munozgonzalez2017towards} and appear to be distinguishable from the clean samples, damaging the utility of the underlying data~\citep{yang2017generative}.
\textit{Backdoor attacks} are a popular family of data poisonings against deep neural networks~\citep{gu2017badnets,barni2019sig,tran2018ss,dolatabadi2022collider}.
Unlike general poisoning attacks, these methods attach triggers to a small fraction of the clean training data so that the model creates an association between the existence of the trigger and a particular class.
During inference, the neural network would behave normally on benign samples.
However, if the trigger is activated, the model would output the attacker's desired value due to the existence of a backdoor in the model.

\paragraph{Diffusion Models.}
As mentioned in \Cref{sec:related}, diffusion models are an emerging family of deep generative models with great capabilities in various domains.
For the vision domain, the forward and backward processes can be defined in three different ways~\citep{croitoru2022diffusion}.
\citet{song2019generative} gradually add Gaussian noise to the image to create noisy versions of the data at different noise scales.
They then utilize score-matching~\citep{vincent2011score} to find a Noise Conditioned Score Network~(NCSN) at various noise levels that can give an approximation of the ground-truth density score.
In this framework, the reverse process uses Langevin dynamics~\citep{welling2011langevin} to give samples of the data distribution.
Closely related to NCSNs, \citet{ho2020ddpm} propose to model the forward and backward processes using Markov chains~\citep{sohl2015deep}.
Each step of the forward process comprises of adding a controlled amount of noise to the image.
If the forward process is repeated for many steps, then the image is completely transferred to random Gaussian noise.
The reverse process is also a Markov chain, where a neural network (known as a denoiser) is used for iterative sampling.
Finally, \citet{song2021scoresde} model the forward and reverse processes through stochastic differential equations~(SDE), and use existing differential solvers to find the solutions of the SDEs.
It can be shown that these three methods are closely related~\citep{song2021scoresde}.

\section{Details of Experimental Settings}\label{sec:settings}
In this section, we provide the details of our experimental settings.
%We will release the code upon acceptance of the paper.

\paragraph{Datasets.}
In our experiments, we use four different datasets.
CIFAR-10 \& 100~\citep{krizhevsky2009learning} are $32\times32$ datasets of colored images, where the classes contain different objects, animals, plants, etc.
SVHN~\citep{netzer2011svhn} is a dataset of house numbers from 0 to 9 in a natural, street view setting.
Finally, ImageNet~\citep{russakovsky2015imagenet} is a dataset of natural images of size $224 \times 224$ with 1000 classes.
In our experiments, we use two simplified versions of this dataset.
First, following the convention of prior research, we select the first 100 classes of this dataset, which we refer to as ImageNet~(IN)-100.
Second, for our distribution mismatch experiments, we follow \citet{huang2021emn} and select 10 classes of ImageNet that are closely aligned with CIFAR-10 and downscale them to $32\times32$ size.
We call this dataset IN-10.
The information on the selected classes can be found in \Cref{tab:imagenet10}.

\paragraph{Classifiers.}
In our experiments, we use four types of neural network image classifiers, namely: ResNet-18~(RN-18)~\citep{he2016deep}, VGG-16~\citep{simonyan2015vgg}, DenseNet-121~(DN-121)~\citep{huang2017densenet}, and WideResNet-34~(WRN-34)~\citep{zagoruyko2016wresnet}.
For training these classifiers over different datasets and also training objectives (vanilla vs.~adversarial training~(AT)), we follow two different training conventions.
The hyper-parameters of each setting are given in \Cref{tab:settings}.
Furthermore, \Cref{tab:exp_setting} indicates the setting used for each experiment in the paper.

\paragraph{Diffusion Models.}
For the diffusion models of \textsc{Avatar}, we follow the implementation of DiffPure\footnote{\url{https://github.com/NVlabs/DiffPure}} and use score SDE~\citep{song2021scoresde}~(for CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, IN-10) and the guided DDPM (for IN-100)~\citep{dhariwal2021diffusion}.
For CIFAR-10 and IN-100, we download the pre-trained versions available online.\footnote{For CIFAR-10, we used the checkpoint for the \texttt{vp/cifar10\_ddpmpp\_deep\_continuous} setting on score SDE repository: \url{https://github.com/yang-song/score_sde_pytorch}. Moreover, we used the unconditional $256 \times 256$ model available on the guided DDPM code-base for IN: \url{https://github.com/openai/guided-diffusion}.}
Additionally, for CIFAR-100, IN-10, and SVHN we use the PyTorch repository of score SDE~\citep{song2021scoresde}, and train variance-preserving diffusion models with continuous DDPM++ architecture, similar to the one used for CIFAR-10.
The FID score of the trained diffusion models is given in \Cref{tab:FID}.

We use seven SOTA availability attacks in our experiments: DeepConfuse~(CON)~\citep{feng2019con}, Neural Tangent Generalization Attacks~(NTGA)~\citep{yuan2021ntga}, Error-minimizing Noise~(EMN)~\citep{huang2021emn}, Targeted Adversarial Poisoning~(TAP)~\citep{fowl2021tap}, Robust EMN~(REMN)~\citep{fu2022remn}, Shortcut~(SHR)~\citep{geirhos2020shortcut}, and Autoregressive attacks~(AR)~\citep{sandoval2022ar}.
The details of each availability attack are given below:
\begin{itemize}
    \item For CON~\citep{feng2019con}, we use the released protected CIFAR-10 dataset, available online at SHR~\citep{yu2022shr} repository.\footnote{\label{shr_repo}\url{https://github.com/dayu11/Availability-Attacks-Create-Shortcuts}}
    Note that since generating this attack for the CIFAR-10 dataset would take 5-7 days, we just used the available data for CIFAR-10 and skipped generating the attack for the other datasets.
    \item For NTGA~\citep{yuan2021ntga}, we use their code\footnote{\url{https://github.com/lionelmessi6410/ntga}} to generate availability attacks for our datasets.
    For CIFAR-10, we used the data published online.
    For CIFAR-100 and SVHN, we used the online repository, and generate NTGA protected data using the \texttt{CNN} surrogate model, \texttt{time-step} of 64, and \texttt{block-size} of 100 to generate perturbations of magnitude $\norm{\boldsymbol{\delta}}_{\infty} \leq 8/255$.
    Due to limited GPU memory, we used the \texttt{FNN} surrogate model to generate perturbations of magnitude $\norm{\boldsymbol{\delta}}_{\infty} \leq 0.1$  for IN-100.
    The rest of the hyper-parameters were set similarly to CIFAR-100 and SVHN.
    \item For EMN~\citep{huang2021emn}, TAP~\citep{fowl2021tap}, and REMN~\citep{fu2022remn}, we use the online repository of REMN\footnote{\url{https://github.com/fshp971/robust-unlearnable-examples}} which contains an implementation of EMN and TAP as well.
    We use the default CIFAR-10 configurations of this repository for CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN.
    For IN-10, we used the default MiniIN configurations of the REMN code-base.
    \item Moreover, we use the SHR GitHub repository\footnoteref{shr_repo} to generate shortcut attacks.
    For CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN, we use the default settings.
    For IN-100, we use \texttt{patchsize} of 32 as advised by the authors.
    \item Finally, we use the official data released on the AR GitHub repository for this attack.\footnote{\url{https://github.com/psandovalsegura/autoregressive-poisoning}}
\end{itemize}
A few samples for each availability attack are shown in \Cref{fig:IN_samples_III}.

\section{Extended Experimental Results}\label{sec:ext_experiments}
In this section, we go over our additional experimental results.

\paragraph{Availability Attacks against Different Neural Network Architectures.}
As discussed previously, our results in \Cref{sec:experiments} are only evaluated against the RN-18~\citep{he2016deep} architecture.
To show that our performance is consistent across various neural network architectures, here we extend our results to three additional models: VGG-16~\citep{simonyan2015vgg}, DN-121~\citep{huang2017densenet}, and WRN-34~\citep{zagoruyko2016wresnet}.
The training details for each case are given in~\Cref{sec:settings}.
Our results for these additional architectures are displayed in~\Cref{tab:architecture_ext}.
As can be seen, our results are consistent across different models, and \textsc{Avatar} can significantly close the gap with clean data performance.
Similarly, we repeat our adversarial training experiments for the above-mentioned models.
Our results for the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN are given in~\Cref{fig:at_all}.\footnote{Note that adversarial training of VGG-16 models over the SVHN dataset was unstable. As such, the respective figure show a few missing points.}
Once again, we see that the RN-18 results are consistent with the other architectures.
Finally, we repeat our ablation study on the selection of the diffusion timestep $t^{*}$ for these additional architectures.
As can be seen from~\Cref{fig:timestep_ext}, the diffusion timestep is not sensitive to the neural network architecture, which makes it easier to set.

\paragraph{Facial Recognition and Data Protection.}
In \Cref{sec:intro}, we discussed in detail that the threat model of existing availability attacks is fragile and a malicious adversary might still exploit the personal data.
This means that possibly no \textit{imperceptible} adversary can protect the image data from being maliciously used.
To show this, we discussed a real-world example in \Cref{sec:experiments} following a similar experiment from \citet{huang2021emn}.
In particular, we create a set of clean and protected identities in the WebFace~\citep{yi2014} dataset by randomly selecting 50 identities from this dataset.
As a result, the remaining 10522 identities are going to constitute our clean data.
For all of the identities, we randomly split the data so that 80\% of that data is allocated to a training set and the rest is the test set.
We assume that the protected identities would add data-protecting perturbations to their images before sharing them.
To this end, we use class-wise EMN~\citep{huang2021emn}, TAP~\citep{fowl2021tap}, REMN~\citep{fu2022remn}, and SHR~\citep{yu2022shr} with a perturbation radius of $\norm{\boldsymbol{\delta}}_{\infty} \leq 16/255$.
For perturbation generation using the first three attacks, we follow the settings of \citet{huang2021emn}.
Specifically, we select 100 random identities from the CelebA~\citep{liu2015deep} dataset and create an auxiliary dataset consisting of these 100 identities and the 50 protected WebFace~\citep{yi2014} identities.
Then, using these 150 identities we generate data protecting perturbations against a neural network with 150 classes.
For SHR, however, we generate the data for all the 10572 WebFace identities and select the relevant data for protecting our above-mentioned 50 identities.
Once we have the protected data, we train an InceptionResNet~\citep{szegedy2017inception} facial recognition over the training set with or without our approach and evaluate the models over the test set.
In our case, we assume that the malicious entity has access to a pre-trained diffusion model over CelebA~\cite{liu2015deep} faces\footnote{For this experiment, we use a pre-trained DDPM model over CelebA-HQ: \url{https://github.com/ermongroup/SDEdit}.}, and can run \textsc{Avatar} over the protected data that it acquires from crawling the web.
Since the WebFace photos are of size ${112 \times 112}$ but the diffusion model generates ${256 \times 256}$ images, we use bi-linear up- and down-sampling to connect the two.
Like the CIFAR-10 experiments, here we also denoise the data with timestep set to 100.
Samples of the WebFace dataset along with the protected data is shown in~\Cref{fig:WebFace_Samples}.
To evaluate the performance of our method, we test the models over the clean test set and record the recognition accuracy for both the protected and clean identities.

As shown in~\Cref{fig:webface}, \textsc{Avatar} can recover the recognition accuracy over protected identities in all cases except the SHR~\citep{yu2022shr} perturbations.
The reason behind this might be two-fold.
First, we are using a sub-optimal diffusion model as both the domain and, more importantly, size of the images have a mismatch.
Second, looking at~\Cref{fig:WebFace_Samples}, we see that while the SHR perturbations can protect the data, they trade the stealthiness of the original data due to their large patches.
As such, the images would lose their utility.
Now, the question is: 
\begin{center}
    \textit{Can we protect the data using stealthy patterns without losing the data utility?}
\end{center}
Interestingly, our theoretical result in~\Cref{thm:convergence} says that this might not be possible.
According to \Cref{thm:convergence}, if the data curator wants to makes the denoising process harder, they need to increase the data-protecting perturbation.
This increase is naturally at odds with the data utility, since by adding more powerful perturbations we lose the data utility.

             For denoising, we use \textsc{Avatar} based on a diffusion model pre-trained on the CelebA~\citep{liu2015deep} dataset.
             As seen, the SHR~\citep{yu2022shr} perturbations leave a noticeable pattern over the protected data, which put their utility (e.g., posting over the social media) under question.
             Nevertheless, since they have a more global structure, they remain persistent even after denoising.

Our approach uses a diffusion model trained over the CelebA~\citep{liu2015deep} dataset. As seen, for all the stealthy data-protecting perturbations our approach manages to recover the performance over protected data. The only exception is SHR, which according to~\Cref{fig:WebFace_Samples}, leaves a noticeable trace over the image, rendering them not useful anymore.}

    "abstract": "In this short note, we prove that singular Reeb vector fields associated with generic Melrose-type $b$-contact forms have either (at least) $2N$ or an infinite number of escape orbits, where $N$ denotes the number of connected components of the critical set. We obtain this result as a corollary of the same statement for the number of escape orbits of singular Beltrami fields using the singular version of Etnyre-Ghrist's contact/Beltrami correspondence.",

    "abstract": "With the advent of fast-paced information dissemination and retrieval, it has become inherently important to resort to automated means of predicting stock market prices. In this paper, we propose Taureau, a framework that leverages Twitter sentiment analysis for predicting stock market movement. The aim of our research is to determine whether Twitter, which is assumed to be representative of the general public, can give insight into the public perception of a particular company and has any correlation to that company's stock price movement. We intend to utilize this correlation to predict stock price movement. We first utilize Tweepy and getOldTweets to obtain historical tweets indicating public opinions for a set of top companies during periods of major events. We filter and label the tweets using standard programming libraries. We then vectorize and generate word embedding from the obtained tweets. Afterward, we leverage TextBlob, a state-of-the-art sentiment analytics engine, to assess and quantify the users' moods based on the tweets. Next, we correlate the temporal dimensions of the obtained sentiment scores with monthly stock price movement data. Finally, we design and evaluate a predictive model to forecast stock price movement from lagged sentiment scores. We evaluate our framework using actual stock price movement data to assess its ability to predict movement direction.",

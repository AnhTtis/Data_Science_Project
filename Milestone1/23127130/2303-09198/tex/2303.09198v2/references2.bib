abstract = {The theory of large deviations is concerned with the exponential decay of probabilities of large fluctuations in random systems. These probabilities are important in many fields of study, including statistics, finance, and engineering, as they often yield valuable information about the large fluctuations of a random system around its most probable state or trajectory. In the context of equilibrium statistical mechanics, the theory of large deviations provides exponential-order estimates of probabilities that refine and generalize Einstein’s theory of fluctuations. This review explores this and other connections between large deviation theory and statistical mechanics, in an effort to show that the mathematical language of statistical mechanics is the language of large deviation theory. The first part of the review presents the basics of large deviation theory, and works out many of its classical applications related to sums of random variables and Markov processes. The second part goes through many problems and results of statistical mechanics, and shows how these can be formulated and derived within the context of large deviation theory. The problems and results treated cover a wide range of physical systems, including equilibrium many-particle systems, noise-perturbed dynamics, nonequilibrium systems, as well as multifractals, disordered systems, and chaotic systems. This review also covers many fundamental aspects of statistical mechanics, such as the derivation of variational principles characterizing equilibrium and nonequilibrium states, the breaking of the Legendre transform for nonconcave entropies, and the characterization of nonequilibrium fluctuations through fluctuation relations.}

abstract = {Abstract This paper studies how close random graphs are typically to their expectations. We interpret this question through the concentration of the adjacency and Laplacian matrices in the spectral norm. We study inhomogeneous Erdös-Rényi random graphs on n vertices, where edges form independently and possibly with different probabilities pij. Sparse random graphs whose expected degrees are fail to concentrate; the obstruction is caused by vertices with abnormally high and low degrees. We show that concentration can be restored if we regularize the degrees of such vertices, and one can do this in various ways. As an example, let us reweight or remove enough edges to make all degrees bounded above by O(d) where . Then we show that the resulting adjacency matrix concentrates with the optimal rate: . Similarly, if we make all degrees bounded below by d by adding weight d / n to all edges, then the resulting Laplacian concentrates with the optimal rate: . Our approach is based on Grothendieck-Pietsch factorization, using which we construct a new decomposition of random graphs. We illustrate the concentration results with an application to the community detection problem in the analysis of networks. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Random Struct. Alg., 51, 538–561, 2017},

abstract = { Denote by A the adjacency matrix of an Erdos-Renyi graph with bounded average degree. We consider the problem of maximizing over the set of positive semidefinite matrices X with diagonal entries X_ii=1. We prove that for large (bounded) average degree d, the value of this semidefinite program (SDP) is --with high probability-- 2n*sqrt(d) + n, o(sqrt(d))+o(n). For a random regular graph of degree d, we prove that the SDP value is 2n*sqrt(d-1)+o(n), matching a spectral upper bound. Informally, Erdos-Renyi graphs appear to behave similarly to random regular graphs for semidefinite programming. We next consider the sparse, two-groups, symmetric community detection problem (also known as planted partition). We establish that SDP achieves the information-theoretically optimal detection threshold for large (bounded) degree. Namely, under this model, the vertex set is partitioned into subsets of size n/2, with edge probability a/n (within group) and b/n (across). We prove that SDP detects the partition with high probability provided (a-b)^2/(4d)> 1+o_d(1), with d= (a+b)/2. By comparison, the information theoretic threshold for detecting the hidden partition is (a-b)^2/(4d)> 1: SDP is nearly optimal for large bounded average degree. Our proof is based on tools from different research areas: (i) A new 'higher-rank' Grothendieck inequality for symmetric matrices; (ii) An interpolation method inspired from statistical physics; (iii) An analysis of the eigenvectors of deformed Gaussian random matrices. },

abstract="Given a public transportation network of stations and connections, we want to find a minimum subset of stations such that each connection runs through a selected station. Although this problem is NP-hard in general, real-world instances are regularly solved almost completely by a set of simple reduction rules. To explain this behavior, we view transportation networks as hitting set instances and identify two characteristic properties, locality and heterogeneity. We then devise a randomized model to generate hitting set instances with adjustable properties. While the heterogeneity does influence the effectiveness of the reduction rules, the generated instances show that locality is the significant factor. Beyond that, we prove that the effectiveness of the reduction rules is independent of the underlying graph structure. Finally, we show that high locality is also prevalent in instances from other domains, facilitating a fast computation of minimum hitting sets.",

  abstract  = "Electricity is the lifeblood of modern society, and for the vast majority of people that electricity is obtained from large, interconnected power grids. However, the grid that was developed in the 20th century, and the incremental improvements made since then, including its underlying analytic foundations, is no longer adequate to completely meet the needs of the 21st century. The next-generation electric grid must be more flexible and resilient. While fossil fuels will have their place for decades to come, the grid of the future will need to accommodate a wider mix of more intermittent generating sources such as wind and distributed solar photovoltaics. \n\nAchieving this grid of the future will require effort on several fronts. There is a need for continued shorter-term engineering research and development, building on the existing analytic foundations for the grid. But there is also a need for more fundamental research to expand these analytic foundations. Analytic Research Foundations for the Next-Generation Electric Grid provide guidance on the longer-term critical areas for research in mathematical and computational sciences that is needed for the next-generation grid. It offers recommendations that are designed to help direct future research as the grid evolves and to give the nation\u2019s research and development infrastructure the tools it needs to effectively develop, test, and use this research.",

    abstract = { We develop and analyze a measure-valued fluid model keeping track of parking and charging requirements of electric vehicles in a local distribution grid. We show how this model arises as an accumulation point of an appropriately scaled sequence of stochastic network models. Our analysis incorporates load-flow models that describe the laws of electricity. Specifically, we consider the alternating current (AC) and the linearized Distflow power flow models and show a continuity property of the associated power allocation functions. }

abstract = {Given the continued integration of intermittent renewable generators in electrical power grids, connection overloads are of increasing concern for grid operators. The risk of an overload due to injection variability can be described mathematically as a barrier-crossing probability of a function of a multidimensional stochastic process. Crude Monte Carlo is a well-known technique to estimate probabilities, but it may be computationally too intensive in this case as typical modern power grids rarely exhibit connection overloads. In this article, we derive an approximate rate function for the overload probability using results from large deviations theory. Based on this large deviations approximation, we apply a rare event simulation technique called splitting to estimate overload probabilities more efficiently than Crude Monte Carlo simulation.We show on example power grids with up to 11 stochastic power injections that for a fixed accuracy, Crude Monte Carlo would require tens to millions as many samples as the proposed splitting technique required. We investigate the balance between accuracy and workload of three splitting schemes, each based on a different approximation of the rate function. We justify the workload increase of large-deviation-based splitting compared to naive splitting—that is, splitting based on merely the Euclidean distance to the rare event set. For a fixed accuracy, naive splitting requires over 60 times as much CPU time as large-deviation-based splitting, illustrating its computational advantage. In these examples, naive splitting—unlike large-deviation-based splitting—requires even more CPU time than CMC simulation, illustrating its pitfall.},

@article{dupuiswang2009,
	Abstract = {Rare event simulation in the context of queueing networks has been an active area of research for more than two decades. A commonly used technique to increase the efficiency of Monte Carlo simulation is importance sampling. However, there are few rigorous results on the design of efficient or asymptotically optimal importance sampling schemes for queueing networks. Using a recently developed game/subsolution approach, we construct simple and efficient state-dependent importance sampling schemes for simulating buffer overflows in stable open Jackson networks. The sampling distributions do not depend on the particular event of interest, and hence overflow probabilities for different events can be estimated simultaneously. A by-product of the analysis is the identification of the minimizing trajectory for the calculus of variation problem that is associated with the sample-path large deviation rate function.},

	Abstract = { It was established in Dupuis and Wang [Dupuis, P., H. Wang. 2004. Importance sampling, large deviations, and differential games. Stoch. Stoch. Rep. 76 481--508, Dupuis, P., H. Wang. 2005. Dynamic importance sampling for uniformly recurrent Markov chains. Ann. Appl. Probab. 15 1--38] that importance sampling algorithms for estimating rare-event probabilities are intimately connected with two-person zero-sum differential games and the associated Isaacs equation. This game interpretation shows that dynamic or state-dependent schemes are needed in order to attain asymptotic optimality in a general setting. The purpose of the present paper is to show that classical subsolutions of the Isaacs equation can be used as a basic and flexible tool for the construction and analysis of efficient dynamic importance sampling schemes. There are two main contributions. The first is a basic theoretical result characterizing the asymptotic performance of importance sampling estimators based on subsolutions. The second is an explicit method for constructing classical subsolutions as a mollification of piecewise affine functions. Numerical examples are included for illustration and to demonstrate that simple, nearly asymptotically optimal importance sampling schemes can be obtained for a variety of problems via the subsolution approach. },

	abstract = {Traffic congestion has become the most stubborn disease for the health of a city. Like the self-healing ability of a biological unit from diseases, transportation can also recover spontaneously from various disturbances. To describe this recovery, we define the resilience metric as the spatiotemporal congestion cluster, which can be used for other network systems. Based on large-scale GPS datasets, we reveal that the recovery behavior of transportation from congestion is governed by three scaling laws for all of the congestion scales. These scaling laws are found independent of microscopic details, including fluctuation of traffic demand and corresponding management. Our results of resilience scaling can help to better characterize and improve the adaptation and recovery of city traffic from various perturbations.The concept of resilience can be realized in natural and engineering systems, representing the ability of a system to adapt and recover from various disturbances. Although resilience is a critical property needed for understanding and managing the risks and collapses of transportation systems, an accepted and useful definition of resilience for urban traffic as well as its statistical property under perturbations are still missing. Here, we define city traffic resilience based on the spatiotemporal clusters of congestion in real traffic and find that the resilience follows a scale-free distribution in 2D city road networks and 1D highways with different exponents but similar exponents on different days and in different cities. The traffic resilience is also revealed to have a scaling relation between the cluster size of the spatiotemporal jam and its recovery duration independent of microscopic details. Our findings of universal traffic resilience can provide an indication toward better understanding and designing of these complex engineering systems under internal and external disturbances.},

  abstract = {Networks of coupled dynamical systems have been used to model biological oscillators1, 2, 3, 4, Josephson junction arrays5,6, excitable media7, neural networks8, 9, 10, spatial games11, genetic control networks12 and many other self-organizing systems. Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon13,14 (popularly known as six degrees of separation15). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

	abstract = {The emergence of synchronization in a network of coupled oscillators is a fascinating topic in various scientific disciplines. A widely adopted model of a coupled oscillator network is characterized by a population of heterogeneous phase oscillators, a graph describing the interaction among them, and diffusive and sinusoidal coupling. It is known that a strongly coupled and sufficiently homogeneous network synchronizes, but the exact threshold from incoherence to synchrony is unknown. Here, we present a unique, concise, and closed-form condition for synchronization of the fully nonlinear, nonequilibrium, and dynamic network. Our synchronization condition can be stated elegantly in terms of the network topology and parameters or equivalently in terms of an intuitive, linear, and static auxiliary system. Our results significantly improve upon the existing conditions advocated thus far, they are provably exact for various interesting network topologies and parameters; they are statistically correct for almost all networks; and they can be applied equally to synchronization phenomena arising in physics and biology as well as in engineered oscillator networks, such as electrical power networks. We illustrate the validity, the accuracy, and the practical applicability of our results in complex network scenarios and in smart grid applications.},

A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence of two generic mechanisms: (i) networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and (ii) new vertices attach preferentially to sites that are already well connected. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.},

Many versions of these approximate models are possible. When their MW flows are reasonably correct (and this is by no means assured), they can often offer compelling advantages. Given their considerable importance in today's electric power industry, dc models merit closer scrutiny. This paper attempts such a re-examination.},

@inproceedings{Purchala2005,
abstract = {In recent days almost every study concerning the analyses of power systems for market related purposes uses DC power flow. DC power flow is a simplification of a full power flow looking only at active power flows. Aspects as voltage support and reactive power management are not considered. However, such simplifications cannot always be justified and might sometimes be unrealistic. In this paper authors analyze the assumptions of DC power flow, and make an attempt at quantifying these using indexes. Among other, the paper answers the question of how low the X/R ratio of line parameters can be, and what is the maximal deviation from the perfect flat voltage which still allows DC power flow to be acceptably accurate.},

@article{Witthaut2015,
abstract = {We study the propagation of cascading failures in complex supply networks with a focus on nonlocal effects occurring far away from the initial failure. It is shown that a high clustering and a small average path length of a network generally suppress nonlocal overloads. These properties are typical for many real-world networks, often called small-world networks, such that cascades propagate mostly locally in these networks. Furthermore, we analyze the spatial aspects of countermeasures based on the intentional removal of additional edges. Nonlocal actions are generally required in networks that have a low redundancy and are thus especially vulnerable to cascades.},

Here we present a simple model for cascading failures based on the dynamical redistribution of the flow on the network. We show that the breakdown of a single node is sufficient to collapse the efficiency of the entire system if the node is among the ones with largest load. This is particularly important for real-world networks with an highly hetereogeneous distribution of loads as the Internet and electrical power grids.},

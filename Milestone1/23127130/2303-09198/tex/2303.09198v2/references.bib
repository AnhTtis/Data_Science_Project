  year     = {2018},
  abstract = {The average nearest neighbor degree (ANND) of a node of degree $k$ is widely used to measure dependencies between degrees of neighbor nodes in a network. We formally analyze ANND in undirected random graphs when the graph size tends to infinity. The limiting behavior of ANND depends on the variance of the degree distribution. When the variance is finite, the ANND has a deterministic limit. When the variance is infinite, the ANND scales with the size of the graph, and we prove a corresponding central limit theorem in the configuration model (CM, a network with random connections). As ANND proved uninformative in the infinite variance scenario, we propose an alternative measure, the average nearest neighbor rank (ANNR). We prove that ANNR converges to a deterministic function whenever the degree distribution has finite mean. We next consider the erased configuration model (ECM), where self-loops and multiple edges are removed, and investigate the well-known `structural negative correlations', or `finite-size effects', that arise in simple graphs, such as ECM, because large nodes can only have a limited number of large neighbors. Interestingly, we prove that for any fixed $k$, ANNR in ECM converges to the same limit as in CM. However, numerical experiments show that finite-size effects occur when $k$ scales with $n$.},

  abstract    = {We prove a large deviation principle for the sum of n independent heavy-tailed random variables, which are subject to a moving cut-off boundary at location n. Conditional on the sum being large at scale n, we show that a finite number of summands take values near the cut-off boundary, while the remaining variables still obey the law of large numbers. This generalises the well-known single-big-jump principle for random variables without cut-off to a situation where just the minimal necessary number of jumps occur. As an application, we consider a random graph with vertex set given by the lattice points of a torus with sidelength 2N. Every vertex is the centre of a ball with random radius sampled from a heavy-tailed distribution. Oriented edges are drawn from the central vertex to all other vertices in this ball. When this graph is conditioned on having an exceptionally large number of edges we use our main result to show that, as N goes to infinity, the excess outdegrees condense in a fixed, finite number of randomly scattered vertices of macroscopic outdegree. By contrast, no condensation occurs for the indegrees of the vertices, which all remain microscopic in size.},

  abstract      = {In this paper we consider the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph in the sparse regime in the limit as the number of vertices $n$ tends to infinity. We are interested in what this graph looks like when it contains many triangles, in two settings. First, we derive asymptotically sharp bounds on the probability that the graph contains a large number of triangles. We show that conditionally on this event, with high probability the graph contains an almost complete subgraph, i.e., the triangles form a near-clique, and has the same local limit as the original Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph. Second, we derive asymptotically sharp bounds on the probability that the graph contains a large number of vertices that are part of a triangle. If order $n$ vertices are in triangles, then the local limit (provided it exists) is different from that of the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph. Our results shed light on the challenges that arise in the description of real-world networks, which often are sparse, yet highly clustered, and on exponential random graphs, which often are used to model such networks.},

  abstract    = {We study an inhomogeneous sparse random graph on [N] = {1, . . . , N } as introduced in a seminal paper by Bollobas, Janson and Riordan (2007): vertices have a type (here in a compact metric space S), and edges between different vertices occur randomly and independently over all vertex pairs, with a probability depending on the two vertex types. In the limit N to infinity, we consider the sparse regime, where the average degree is O(1). We prove a large-deviations principle with explicit rate function for the statistics of the collection of all the connected components, registered according to their vertex type sets, and distinguished according to being microscopic (of finite size) or macroscopic (of size proportional to N). In doing so, we derive explicit logarithmic asymptotics for the probability that GN is connected. We present a full analysis of the rate function including its minimizers. From this analysis we deduce a number of limit laws, conditional and unconditional, which provide comprehensive information about all the microscopic and macroscopic components of the graph. In particular, we recover the criterion for the existence of the phase transition given in [5].},

\section{Conclusion and future work}
In this paper, we studied a partially-ordered secretary problem, wherein a constrained budget of comparisons is allowed. Our findings encompass both asymptotic and non-asymptotic analyses. Specifically, we explore the asymptotic behavior of the single threshold algorithm with $K$ groups, and the double threshold algorithm for two groups. Furthermore, in the context of two groups, we present a non-asymptotic optimal memoryless algorithm. Through numerical experimentation, we demonstrate that this algorithm behaves as a $\DT$ algorithm, and, leveraging this insight, we show how to numerically compute the optimal $\DT$ thresholds, which guarantee a fast convergence of the success probability to the theoretical upper bound of $1/e$.

The paper explores more realistic online selection processes, wherein nuanced factors such as imperfect comparisons and optimal budget utilization are considered. Future investigations could concern the study of $\DT$ algorithms in more generality, the analytical characterization of optimal thresholds for any budget $B$, and the design of provably optimal algorithms for the general case of $K$ groups.

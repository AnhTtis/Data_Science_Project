    "abstract": "In this article, we consider the following stochastic fractional diffusion equation\n  \\begin{equation*}\n  \\left(\\partial^β+\\dfracν{2}\\left(-Δ\\right)^{α/ 2}\\right) u(t, x)= λ\\: I_{0_+}^γ\\left[u(t, x) \\dot{W}(t, x)\\right] ,\\quad t>0,\\: x \\in \\mathbb{R},\n  \\end{equation*}\n  where $α>0$, $β\\in(0,2]$, $γ\\ge 0$, $λ\\neq0$, $ν>0$, and $\\dot{W}$ is a Gaussian noise which is white or fractional in time and rough in space. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution in the Itô-Skorohod sense and obtain the lower and upper bounds for the $p$-th moment. The Hölder regularity of the solution is also studied.",

    "abstract": "The idea of rough statistical convergence for double sequences was studied by Ozcan and Or[29] in a intuitionistic fuzzy normed space. Recently the same has been generalized in the ideal context by Hossain and Banerjee[15] for sequences. Here in this paper we have discussed the idea of rough ideal convergence of double sequences in intuitionistic fuzzy normed spaces generalizing the idea of rough statistical convergence of double sequences. Also we have defined rough I2-cluster points for a double sequence and also investigated some of the basic properties associated with rough I2-limit set of a double sequence in a intuitionistic fuzzy normed space.",

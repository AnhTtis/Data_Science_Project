    "abstract": "An analysis of the asymmetric reactions $^{40,48}$Ca+$^{12}$C at 25 and 40 MeV/nucleon is presented. Data have been collected with six modules of the FAZIA array. The analysis is focused on the breakup channel of sources produced in dissipative collisions, partially corresponding to incomplete fusion processes. The study has been performed both on detected fragments and on some resonances reconstructed by means of particle-fragment correlations, with a focus on the evolution of the breakup channel with the beam energy and the neutron content of the system, looking in particular at the relative velocity between the breakup fragments. Results show that also\n  Carbon fragments reconstructed by means of particle correlations can be in large part interpreted as the light partner of a scission.",

    "abstract": "We prove explicit stability estimates for the sphere packing problem in\ndimensions 8 and 24, showing that, in the lattice case, if a lattice is $\\sim\n\\varepsilon$ close to satisfying the optimal density, then it is, in a suitable\nsense, $O(\\varepsilon^{1/2})$ close to the $E_8$ and Leech lattices,\nrespectively. In the periodic setting, we prove that, under the same\nassumptions, we may take a large 'frame' through which our packing locally\nlooks like $E_8$ or $\\Lambda_{24}.$\n  Our methods make explicit use of the magic functions constructed by M.\nViazovska in dimension 8 and by H. Cohn, A. Kumar, S. Miller, the second\nauthor, and M. Viazovska in dimension 24, together with results of independent\ninterest on the abstract stability of the lattices $E_8$ and $\\Lambda_{24}.$",

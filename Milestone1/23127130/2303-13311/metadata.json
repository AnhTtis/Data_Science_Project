    "abstract": "Barium ruthenate Ba$_{4}$Ru$_{3}$O$_{10}$, in which Ru$_{3}$O$_{12}$ trimers are connected together to form a chequered two-dimensional framework, has been synthesised and its structural, magnetic and transport properties studied between 300 K and 2 K. The paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic transition at $T_N \\sim 105$ K evidenced on the susceptibility curve coincides with an increase of electron localization in transport measurements. Thermoelectric power and Hall coefficient measurements both exhibit dramatic changes at $T_N$, characteristic of a reconstruction of the bands structure near the Fermi level. No pronounced structural changes are observed at TN in this compound. The magnetic scattering signal on the neutron powder diffraction patterns below $T_N$ is weak, but can be tentatively modelled with an antiferromagnetic ordering of the spins at both ends of a trimer, the spin of the more symmetric Ru site remaining idle. Crystal field and strong spin-orbit coupling at the Ru$^{4+}$ site seem to be the key parameters to understand the magnetic state of Ba$_{4}$Ru$_{3}$O$_{10}$.",

    "abstract": "We define and examine nonlinear potential by Bessel convolution with Bessel kernel. We investigate removable sets with respect to Laplace-Bessel inequality. By studying the maximal and fractional maximal measure, a Wolff type inequality is proved. Finally the relation of B-$p$ capacity and B-Lipschitz mapping, and the B-$p$ capacity and weighted Hausdorff measure and the B-$p$ capacity of Cantor sets are examined.",

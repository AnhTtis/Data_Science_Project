    "abstract": "This vision paper lays the preliminary foundations for Data Narrative Management Systems (DNMS), systems that enable the storage, sharing, and manipulation of data narratives. We motivate the need for such formal foundations and introduce a simple logical framework inspired by the relational model. The core of this framework is a Data Narrative Manipulation Language inspired by the extended relational algebra. We illustrate its use via examples and discuss the main challenges for the implementation of this vision.",

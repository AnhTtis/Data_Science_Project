    "abstract": "In this paper we study global nonlinear stability for the Dirac-Klein-Gordon system in two and three space dimensions for small and regular initial data. In the case of two space dimensions, we consider the Dirac-Klein-Gordon system with a massless Dirac field and a massive scalar field, and prove global existence, sharp time decay estimates and linear scattering for the solutions. In the case of three space dimensions, we consider the Dirac-Klein-Gordon system with a mass parameter in the Dirac equation, and prove uniform (in the mass parameter) global existence, unified time decay estimates and linear scattering in the top order energy space.",

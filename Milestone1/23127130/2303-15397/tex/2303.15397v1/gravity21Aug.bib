abstract = {Quantum field theory predicts a number of unusual physical effects in non-Minkowskian manifolds (flat or curved) that have no immediate analogs in Minkowski spacetime. The following examples are reviewed: (1) The Casimir effect; (2) Radiation from accelerating conductors; (3) Particle production in manifolds with horizons, including both stationary black holes and black holes formed by collapse. In the latter examples curvature couples directly to matter through the stress tensor and induces the creation of real particles. However, it also induces serious divergences in the vacuum stress. These divergences are analyzed, and methods for handling them are reviewed.}

	Abstract = {We argue that the following three statements cannot all be true: (i) Hawking radiation is in a pure state, (ii) the information carried by the radiation is emitted from the region near the horizon, with low energy effective field theory valid beyond some microscopic distance from the horizon, and (iii) the infalling observer encounters nothing unusual at the horizon. Perhaps the most conservative resolution is that the infalling observer burns up at the horizon. Alternatives would seem to require novel dynamics that nevertheless cause notable violations of semiclassical physics at macroscopic distances from the horizon.},

abstract = "Conservation of the axial current in massless electrodynamics is considered in connection with the existence of the so-called anomalous terms in the equation for the divergence of the axial current. It is shown that in the limit of vanishing electron mass m transitions forbidden by γ5 invariance give a non-vanishing contribution to the imaginary part of the triangle graph. This phenomenon is analogous in some respect to the breaking of the formal consequences from γ5 invariance for the probability of the transition between electrons with right and left helicity through the emission of a photon. As was noticed by Lee and Nauenberg, this probability does not vanish in the limit of m=0. In this respect the appearance of an ultraviolet divergence in the triangle graph is irrelevant to the breaking of γ5 invariance. We give some examples of well defined loop graphs and tree graphs which nevertheless violate conservation of the axial current at m=0 for some particular configuration of external momenta. We consider also another limiting procedure when m is chosen to be equal to zero from the very beginning but the photon mass is chosen to be finite. It then becomes possible to construct a conserved axial current but the matrix element associated with the triangle graph proves to be singular in the photon mass. In the case of m=0 a recipe to calculate the triangle graph is given which implies the validity of the divergence equation without any anomalous term. However, the matrix element of the pseudoscalar density j5 is singular in m in this case."

	Abstract = {As a low energy effective field theory, classical General Relativity receives an infrared relevant modification from the conformal trace anomaly of the energy-momentum tensor of massless, or nearly massless, quantum fields. The local form of the effective action associated with the trace anomaly is expressed in terms of a dynamical scalar field that couples to the conformal factor of the spacetime metric, allowing it to propagate over macroscopic distances. Linearized around flat spacetime, this semi-classical EFT admits scalar gravitational wave solutions in addition to the transversely polarized tensor waves of the classical Einstein theory. The amplitude of the scalar wave modes, as well as their energy and energy flux which are positive and contain a monopole moment, are computed. Astrophysical sources for scalar gravitational waves are considered, with the excited gluonic condensates in the interiors of neutron stars in merger events with other compact objects likely to provide the strongest burst signals.},

Both kinds of anomaly can be removed at the expense of introducingn-dimensional, rather than 4-dimensional, counterterms.},

All Conservation, Trace and Conformal Ward Identities (CWIs), including contact terms, are completely fixed in this covariant approach. The Trace and CWIs are anomalous. Their anomalous contributions may be computed unambiguously by metric variation of the exact 1PI quantum effective action determined by the conformal anomaly of 〈Tμν〉 in d=4 curved space. This action implies the existence of massless propagator poles in three and higher point correlators of Tμν. The metric variations of the anomaly effective action in its local form in terms of a scalar conformalon field are carried out explicitly for the case of the correlator of three CFT stress-energy tensors, and the result is shown to coincide with the algebraic reconstruction of 〈TTT〉 from its transverse, tracefree parts, determined independently by the solution of the CWIs in d dimensional flat space in the momentum representation. This demonstrates that the specific analytic structure and massless poles predicted by the general curved space anomaly effective action are in fact a necessary feature of the exact solution of the anomalous CWIs in any d=4 CFT."

We compute the contributions of the reparameterization ghosts to the central charges for D = 4, as well as the quantum contribution of the conformal factor itself. The ghost contribution satisfies the necessary Wess-Zumino consistency condition only if combined with the spin-2 modes, whose contributions to the trace anomaly we also discuss."

	Abstract = {The status of experimental tests of general relativity and of theoretical frameworks for analyzing them is reviewed and updated. Einstein's equivalence principle (EEP) is well supported by experiments such as the E{\"o}tv{\"o}s experiment, tests of local Lorentz invariance and clock experiments. Ongoing tests of EEP and of the inverse square law are searching for new interactions arising from unification or quantum gravity. Tests of general relativity at the post-Newtonian level have reached high precision, including the light deflection, the Shapiro time delay, the perihelion advance of Mercury, the Nordtvedt effect in lunar motion, and frame-dragging. Gravitational wave damping has been detected in an amount that agrees with general relativity to better than half a percent using the Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar, and a growing family of other binary pulsar systems is yielding new tests, especially of strong-field effects. Current and future tests of relativity will center on strong gravity and gravitational waves.},

When small bubbles in a second phase are created in the medium of the normal phase with a characteristic size of one fermi, the hadron constituent fields may propagate inside the bubbles in normal manner. The bubble (bag) is stabilized against the pressure of the confined hadron constituent fields by vacuum pressure and surface tension. Inside the bag the colored quarks and gluons are governed by the equations of quantum chromodynamics.}

For imaginary surface tension the absolute value of the membrane field has a non-vanishing vacuum expectation value and the gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken; as a consequence, the gauge field Aμνϱ(x) acquires a mass while the Goldstone bosons disappear from the physical spectrum.

For a wide range of parameters and initial conditions, this process will naturally stop as soon as the cosmological constant is near zero, even if the energy remaining in the antisymmetric tensor field is large. Among the instantons obtained, some are interpreted as representing a topology change, in which an open space spontaneously compactifies; however, the quantum probability for these processes vanishes."

abstract = {The functional measure for the Feynman path integral over four-geometries is constructed by the same generally covariant methods used by Polyakov for string theory. Ultralocality and general covariance determine the gaussian measure almost uniquely, and lead to a jacobian factor in the path integral which is just that required to render the linearized conformal perturbations (σ) of any Ricci-flat background into non-propagating, constrained modes. The non-trivial jacobian in the measure is equivalent to the non-local field redefinition χ = √−▽2 σ. It is the euclidean continuation of χ (rather than σ) which leads to a completely convergent euclidean path integral, consistent with unitarity. Thus, the conformal factor problem in one-loop euclidean quantum gravity is understood to be an artifact of the naive analytic continuation of the Einstein-Hilbert action. We reconsider the issue of the ground state of quantum gravity in light of this result, and show that flat space-time is absolutely stable to gaussian quantum fluctuations in the infrared. The extension of the method to non-Ricci-flat backgrounds is discussed as well.}

A covariant, nonlocal action expandable around flat space isconstructed such that the trace of its metric functional derivative has the general form of the anomaly (without an R2 term). This is achieved via the introduction of a new fourth-order, conformally covariant scalar operator analogous to the second-order operator ▿2 + 16R. The non-local action can be viewed as arising from a local action as the result of integrating out an auxiliary scalar field. We point out that no effective action, local or non-local, can give rise to an R2 trace. This suggests that R2 ultraviolet divergences must cancel in any realistic quantum theory of gravitation and matter derivable from an effective action.}

	abstract = {We report the observation of a compact binary coalescence involving a 22.2–24.3 M
⊙ black hole and a compact object with a mass of 2.50–2.67 M
⊙ (all measurements quoted at the 90 credible level). The gravitational-wave signal, GW190814, was observed during LIGO’s and Virgo’s third observing run on 2019 August 14 at 21:10:39 UTC and has a signal-to-noise ratio of 25 in the three-detector network. The source was localized to 18.5 deg2 at a distance of  Mpc; no electromagnetic counterpart has been confirmed to date. The source has the most unequal mass ratio yet measured with gravitational waves, , and its secondary component is either the lightest black hole or the heaviest neutron star ever discovered in a double compact-object system. The dimensionless spin of the primary black hole is tightly constrained to ≤0.07. Tests of general relativity reveal no measurable deviations from the theory, and its prediction of higher-multipole emission is confirmed at high confidence. We estimate a merger rate density of 1–23 Gpc−3 yr−1 for the new class of binary coalescence sources that GW190814 represents. Astrophysical models predict that binaries with mass ratios similar to this event can form through several channels, but are unlikely to have formed in globular clusters. However, the combination of mass ratio, component masses, and the inferred merger rate for this event challenges all current models of the formation and mass distribution of compact-object binaries.}

abstract = {As the luminosity of an accreting black hole drops to a few percent of Eddington, the spectrum switches from the familiar soft state to a hard state that is well-described by a distended and tenuous advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF). An ADAF is a poor radiator, and the ion temperature can approach 1012K near the center, although the electrons are cooler, with their temperature typically capped at ∼109-11K. The foundational papers predicted that the large thermal energy in an ADAF would drive strong winds and jets, as later observed and also confirmed in computer simulations. Of chief interest, however, is the accreting gas that races inward. It carries the bulk of the accretion energy as stored thermal energy, which vanishes without a trace as the gas passes through the hole’s event horizon. One thus expects black holes in the ADAF regime to be unusually faint. Indeed, this is confirmed by a comparison of accreting stellar-mass black holes and neutron stars, which reside in very similar transient X-ray binary systems. The black holes are on average observed to be fainter by a factor of ∼100–1000. The natural explanation is that a neutron star must radiate the advected thermal energy from its surface, whereas a black hole can hide the energy behind its event horizon. The case for an event horizon in Sagittarius A∗, which is immune to caveats on jet outflows and is furthermore independent of the ADAF model, is especially compelling. These two lines of evidence for event horizons are impervious to counterarguments that invoke strong gravity or exotic stars.}

Until recently, their compact size has prevented efforts to study them directly. Here we show that recent millimeter and infrared observations of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, all but require the existence of a horizon. Specifically, we show that these observations limit the luminosity of any putative visible compact emitting region to below 0.4\% of Sgr A*'s accretion luminosity. Equivalently, this requires the efficiency of converting the gravitational binding energy liberated during accretion into radiation and kinetic outflows to be greater than 99.6\%, considerably larger than those implicated in Sgr A*, and therefore inconsistent with the existence of such a visible region. Finally, since we are able to frame this argument entirely in terms of observable quantities, our results apply to all geometric theories of gravity that admit stationary solutions, including the commonly discussed f(R) class of theories.}

Observations at millimeter wavelengths with the Event Horizon Telescope have localized the emission from the base of this jet to angular scales comparable to the putative black hole horizon. The jet might be powered directly by an accretion disk or by electromagnetic extraction of the rotational energy of the black hole. However, even the latter mechanism requires a confining thick accretion disk to maintain the required magnetic flux near the black hole. Therefore, regardless of the jet mechanism, the observed jet power in M87 implies a certain minimum mass accretion rate. If the central compact object in M87 were not a black hole but had a surface, this accretion would result in considerable thermal near-infrared and optical emission from the surface. Current flux limits on the nucleus of M87 strongly constrain any such surface emission. This rules out the presence of a surface and thereby provides indirect evidence for an event horizon.}

ABSTRACT = {Black Holes are possibly the most enigmatic objects in our universe. From their detection in gravitational waves upon their mergers, to their snapshot eating at the centres of galaxies, black hole astrophysics has undergone an observational renaissance in the past four years. Nevertheless, they remain active playgrounds for strong gravity and quantum effects, where novel aspects of the elusive theory of quantum gravity may be hard at work. In this review article, we provide an overview of the strong motivations for why “Quantum Black Holes” may be radically different from their classical counterparts in Einstein’s General Relativity. We then discuss the observational signatures of quantum black holes, focusing on gravitational wave echoes as smoking guns for quantum horizons (or exotic compact objects), which have led to significant recent excitement and activity. We review the theoretical underpinning of gravitational wave echoes and critically examine the seemingly contradictory observational claims regarding their (non-)existence. Finally, we discuss the future theoretical and observational landscape for unraveling the “Quantum Black Holes in the Sky”.},

abstract={New theoretical approaches developed in the last years predict that macroscopic quantum gravity effects in black holes should lead to modifications of the gravitational wave signals expected in the framework of classical general relativity, with these modifications being characterized in certain scenarios by the existence of dampened rep-etitions of the primary signal. Here we use the fact that non-perturbative corrections to the near-horizon external geometry of black holes are necessary for these modifications to exist, in order to classify different proposals and paradigms with respect to this criterion and study in a neat and systematic way their phenomenology. Proposals that lead naturally to the existence of echoes in the late-time ringdown of gravitational wave signals from black hole mergers must share the replacement of black holes by horizonless configurations with a physical surface showing reflective properties in the relevant range of frequencies. On the other hand, proposals or paradigms that restrict quantum gravity effects on the external geometry to be perturbative, such as black hole complementarity or the closely related firewall proposal, do not display echoes. For the sake of completeness we exploit the interplay between the timescales associated with the formation of firewalls and the mechanism behind the existence of echoes in order to conclude that even unconventional distortions of the firewall concept (such as naked firewalls) do not lead to this phenomenon.},

We obtain that the velocity of the walls of the true vacuum bubble at its expansion does not tend to the velocity of light. We find that vacuum shells could exist now in the universe, which do not contradict to observational cosmology. The types of black holes created are investigated. Restrictions on the mass of the black holes formed from remnants of the false vacuum and on the fraction of the vacuum energy pumped into such black holes are obtained."

abstract = {A model is proposed in which the Hawking particles emitted by a black hole are treated as an envelope of matter that obeys an equation of state, and acts as a source in Einstein's equations. This is a crude but interesting way to accommodate for the back reaction. For large black holes, the solution can be given analytically, if the equation of state is p = κϱ, with 0 < κ < 1. The solution exhibits a singularity at the origin. If we assume N free particle types, we can use a Hartree-Fock procedure to compute the contribution of one such field to the entropy, and the result scales as expected as 1N. A slight mismatch is found that could be attributed to quantum corrections to Einstein's equations, but can also be made to disappear when κ is set equal to one. The case κ = 1 is further analysed.}

abstract = "In electromagnetism, like charges repel, opposite charges attract. A remarkable feature of the gravitational force is that like masses attract. This gives rise to an instability: the more mass you have, the stronger the attractive force, until an inevitable implosion follows, leading to a “black hole”. It is in the black hole where an apparent conflict between Einstein’s General Relativity and the laws of Quantum Mechanics becomes manifest. Most physicists now agree that a black hole should be described by a Schrödinger equation, with a Hermitean Hamiltonian, but this requires a modification of general relativity. Both General Relativity and Quantum mechanics are shaking on their foundations."

Although the black hole is classically stable, quantum particle creation processes will result in the emission of Hawking radiation to infinity and corresponding mass loss of the black hole, eventually resulting in the complete evaporation of the black hole. Semiclassical arguments strongly suggest that, in the process of black hole formation and evaporation, a pure quantum state will evolve to a mixed state, i.e. there will be ‘information loss’. There has been considerable controversy over this issue for more than 40 years. In this review, we present the arguments in favor of information loss, and analyze some of the counter-arguments and alternative possibilities.}

	abstract = {The black hole information paradox is a very poorly understood problem. It is often believed that Hawking's argument is not precisely formulated, and a more careful accounting of naturally occurring quantum corrections will allow the radiation process to become unitary. We show that such is not the case, by proving that small corrections to the leading order Hawking computation cannot remove the entanglement between the radiation and the hole. We formulate Hawking's argument as a ‘theorem’: assuming ‘traditional’ physics at the horizon and usual assumptions of locality we will be forced into mixed states or remnants. We also argue that one cannot explain away the problem by invoking AdS/CFT duality. We conclude with recent results on the quantum physics of black holes which show that the interior of black holes have a ‘fuzzball’ structure. This nontrivial structure of microstates resolves the information paradox and gives a qualitative picture of how classical intuition can break down in black hole physics.}

Despite this, observations supporting their existence are scarce, and their interpretation is unclear. In this Perspective we outline the case for black holes that has been made over the past few decades, and provide an overview of how well observations adjust to this paradigm. Unsurprisingly, we conclude that observational proof for black holes is, by definition, impossible to obtain. However, just like Popper's black swan, alternatives can be ruled out or confirmed to exist with a single observation. These observations are within reach. In the coming years and decades, we will enter an era of precision gravitational-wave physics with more sensitive detectors. Just as accelerators have required larger and larger energies to probe smaller and smaller scales, more sensitive gravitational-wave detectors will probe regions closer and closer to the horizon, potentially reaching Planck scales and beyond.

	Abstract = {Very compact objects probe extreme gravitational fields and may be the key to understand outstanding puzzles in fundamental physics. These include the nature of dark matter, the fate of spacetime singularities, or the loss of unitarity in Hawking evaporation. The standard astrophysical description of collapsing objects tells us that massive, dark and compact objects are black holes. Any observation suggesting otherwise would be an indication of beyond-the-standard-model physics. Null results strengthen and quantify the Kerr black hole paradigm. The advent of gravitational-wave astronomy and precise measurements with very long baseline interferometry allow one to finally probe into such foundational issues. We overview the physics of exotic dark compact objects and their observational status, including the observational evidence for black holes with current and future experiments.},

  abstract = {One of the very small number of serious alternatives to the usual concept of an astrophysical black hole is the ‘gravastar’ model developed by Mazur and Mottola, and a related phase-transition model due to Laughlin et al. We consider a generalized class of similar models that exhibit continuous pressure—without the presence of infinitesimally thin shells. By considering the usual TOV equation for static solutions with negative central pressure, we find that gravastars cannot be perfect fluids—anisotropic pressures in the ‘crust’ of a gravastar-like object are unavoidable. The anisotropic TOV equation can then be used to bound the pressure anisotropy. The transverse stresses that support a gravastar permit a higher compactness than is given by the Buchdahl–Bondi bound for perfect-fluid stars. Finally, we comment on the qualitative features of the equation of state that gravastar material must have if it is to do the desired job of preventing horizon formation.}

Either with an ansatz for the equation of state connecting the radial pr and tangential pt pressure or with a calculated equation of state with non-homogeneous energy/fluid density, solutions are obtained which in all aspects satisfy the conditions expected for an anisotropic gravastar (Cattoen et al 2005 Class.

We derive sharp analytic bounds on the surface compactness (2m/r) that follow from the requirement that the dominant energy condition (DEC) holds at the shell. In the case of Schwarzschild exterior, the highest surface compactness is achieved with the stiff shell in the limit of vanishing (dark) energy density in the interior. In the case of Schwarzschild–de Sitter exterior, in addition to the gravastar configurations with the shell under surface pressure, gravastar configurations with vanishing shell pressure (dust shells), as well as configurations with the shell under surface tension, are allowed by the DEC. Respective bounds on the surface compactness are derived for all cases. We also consider the speed of sound on the shell as derived from the requirement that the shell is stable against the radial perturbations. The causality requirement (sound speed not exceeding that of light) further restricts the space of allowed gravastar configurations.}

We use modern equations of state for neutron star matter, fitted to experimental nucleon-nucleon scattering data and the properties of light nuclei, to calculate, within the framework of Rhoades &amp; Ruffini (1974), the minimum upper limit on a neutron star mass. Regarding the equation of state as valid up to twice nuclear matter saturation density, ρnm, we obtain a secure upper bound on the neutron star mass equal to 2.9 M☉. We also find that in order to reach the lowest possible upper bound of 2.2 M☉, we need to understand the physical properties of neutron matter up to a density of ~4ρnm.}

abstract = {Merger reveals mass at which the cosmos's densest objects collapse into black holes. Astrophysicists have long wondered how massive a neutron star—the corpse of certain exploding stars—could be without collapsing under its own gravity to form a black hole. Now, four teams have independently deduced a mass limit for neutron stars of about 2.2 times the mass of the sun. To do so, all four groups analyzed last year's blockbuster observations of the merger of two neutron stars, spied on 17 September 2017 by dozens of observatories. That approach may seem unpromising, as it might appear that the merging neutron stars would have immediately produced a black hole. However, the researchers argue that the merger first produced a spinning, overweight neutron star momentarily propped up by centrifugal force. They deduce that just before it collapsed, the short-lived neutron star had to be near the maximum mass for one spinning as a solid body. That inference allowed them to use a scaling relationship to estimate the maximum mass of a nonrotating, stable neutron star, starting from the total mass of the original pair and the amount of matter spewed into space.}}

The examples include well-known model-universes which exhibit one or the other type of horizon, both types at once, or no horizon.

	abstract = {In a single process, the merger of binary neutron star systems combines extreme gravity, the copious emission of gravitational waves, complex microphysics and electromagnetic processes, which can lead to astrophysical signatures observable at the largest redshifts. We review here the recent progress in understanding what could be considered Einstein’s richest laboratory, highlighting in particular the numerous significant advances of the last decade. Although special attention is paid to the status of models, techniques and results for fully general-relativistic dynamical simulations, a review is also offered on the initial data and advanced simulations with approximate treatments of gravity. Finally, we review the considerable mount of work carried out on the post-merger phase, including black-hole formation, torus accretion onto the merged compact object, the connection with gamma-ray burst engines, ejected material, and its nucleosynthesis.}

	Abstract = {Many evolution problems in physics are described by partial differential equations on an infinite domain; therefore, one is interested in the solutions to such problems for a given initial dataset. A prominent example is the binary black-hole problem within Einstein's theory of gravitation, in which one computes the gravitational radiation emitted from the inspiral of the two black holes, merger and ringdown. Powerful mathematical tools can be used to establish qualitative statements about the solutions, such as their existence, uniqueness, continuous dependence on the initial data, or their asymptotic behavior over large time scales. However, one is often interested in computing the solution itself, and unless the partial differential equation is very simple, or the initial data possesses a high degree of symmetry, this computation requires approximation by numerical discretization. When solving such discrete problems on a machine, one is faced with a finite limit to computational resources, which leads to the replacement of the infinite continuum domain with a finite computer grid. This, in turn, leads to a discrete initial-boundary value problem. The hope is to recover, with high accuracy, the exact solution in the limit where the grid spacing converges to zero with the boundary being pushed to infinity.},

However, most extensions suffer from severe pathologies at the mathematical level which have stymied a thorough exploration of putative theories. With the aid of a model problem which captures typical pathologies, we explore suggested methods to control them. We find that the approach that modifies the equations to control higher-order gradients is both robust and efficient.}

In this paper, we provide further generalizations of this bound by placing a number of constraints on the interior geometry (the metric components), on the local acceleration due to gravity, on various combinations of the internal density and pressure profiles and on the internal compactness 2m(r)/r of static fluid spheres. We do this by adapting the standard tool of comparing the generic fluid sphere with a Schwarzschild interior geometry of the same mass and radius—in particular, we obtain several results for the pressure profile (not merely the central pressure) that are considerably more subtle than might first be expected.}

abstract = {This is the first of series of papers in which we investigate stability of the spherically symmetric spacetime with de Sitter centre. Geometry, asymptotically Schwarzschild for large r and asymptotically de Sitter as r → 0, describes a vacuum non-singular black hole for m ⩾ mcr and particle-like self-gravitating structure for m &lt; mcr where a critical value mcr depends on the scale of the symmetry restoration to the de Sitter group in the origin. In this paper, we address the question of stability of a vacuum non-singular black hole with de Sitter centre to external perturbations. We specify first two types of geometries with and without changes of topology. Then we derive the general equations governing polar perturbations, specify criteria of stability for a regular black hole with de Sitter centre, and study in detail the case of the density profile  where ρ0 is the density of de Sitter vacuum at the centre,  is the de Sitter radius and rg is the Schwarzschild radius.}

If the stress induced by vacuum polarisation along the axes of the 3-cylinders r=constant is a tension rather than a pressure, the spacetime geometry could be self-regulatory and describable semiclassically down to radii of a few Planck units. The nucleus would then appear as an open string of roughly constant sub-Planckian density, with a thickness of order (h(cross)G2M/c5)13/-about 10-20 cm for a solar-mass black hole.}

ABSTRACT = {A new final endpoint of complete gravitational collapse is proposed. By extending the concept of Bose-Einstein condensation to gravitational systems, a static, spherically symmetric solution to Einstein's equations is obtained, characterized by an interior de Sitter region of p=-rho; gravitational vacuum condensate and an exterior Schwarzschild geometry of arbitrary total mass M. These are separated by a phase boundary with a small but finite thickness, replacing both the Schwarzschild and de Sitter classical horizons. The resulting collapsed cold, compact object has no singularities, no event horizons, and a globally defined Killing time. Its entropy is maximized under small fluctuations and is given by the standard hydrodynamic entropy of the thin shell, which is of order kB&#8467;Mc/&#8463;, instead of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, SBH=4&pi;kBGM2/&#8463;c. Unlike BHs, a collapsed star of this kind is consistent with quantum theory, thermodynamically stable, and suffers from no information paradox.}

	abstract = {Black holes are an apparently unavoidable prediction of classical General Relativity, at least if matter obeys the strong energy condition ρ + 3p ≥ 0. However quantum vacuum fluctuations generally violate this condition, as does the eq. of state of cosmological dark energy ρ = −p > 0. When quantum effects are considered, black holes lead to a number of thermodynamic paradoxes associated with the Hawking temperature and assumption of black hole entropy, which are briefly reviewed. It is argued that the largest quantum effects arise from the conformal scalar degrees of freedom generated by the trace anomaly of the stress-energy tensor in curved space. At event horizons these can have macroscopically large backreaction effects on the geometry, potentially removing the classical event horizon of black hole and cosmological spacetimes, replacing them with a quantum phase boundary layer, where the effective value of the gravitational vacuum energy density can change. In the effective theory including the quantum effects of the anomaly, the cosmological term ? becomes a dynamical condensate, whose value depends upon boundary conditions at the horizon. By taking a positive value in the interior of a fully collapsed star, the effective cosmological term removes any singularity, replacing it with a smooth dark energy de {Sitter} interior. The resulting gravitational vacuum condensate star (or gravastar) configuration resolves all black hole paradoxes, and provides a testable alternative to black holes as the final quantum mechanical end state of complete gravitational collapse. The observed Λ eff dark energy of our universe likewise may be a macroscopic finite size effect whose value depends not on Planck scale or other microphysics but on the cosmological Hubble horizon scale itself.}

abstract = {The gravastar picture is an alternative model to the concept of a black hole, where there is an effective phase transition at or near where the event horizon is expected to form, and the interior is replaced by a de Sitter condensate. In this work a generalization of the gravastar picture is explored by considering matching of an interior solution governed by the dark energy equation of state, ω ≡ p/ρ &lt; −1/3, to an exterior Schwarzschild vacuum solution at a junction interface. The motivation for implementing this generalization arises from the fact that recent observations have confirmed an accelerated cosmic expansion, for which dark energy is a possible candidate. Several relativistic dark energy stellar configurations are analysed by imposing specific choices for the mass function. The first case considered is that of a constant energy density, and the second choice that of a monotonic decreasing energy density in the star's interior. The dynamical stability of the transition layer of these dark energy stars to linearized spherically symmetric radial perturbations about static equilibrium solutions is also explored. It is found that large stability regions exist that are sufficiently close to where the event horizon is expected to form, so that it would be difficult to distinguish the exterior geometry of the dark energy stars, analysed in this work, from an astrophysical black hole.}

We take considerable effort to make the analysis as  general and unified as practicable; investigating both the internal physics of the transition layer and its interaction with “external forces” arising due to interactions between the transition layer and the bulk spacetime.  Furthermore, we discuss both the dynamic and static situations. In particular, we consider “bounded excursion” dynamical configurations, and probe the stability of static configurations. For gravastars there is always a particularly compelling configuration in which the surface energy density is zero, while surface tension is nonzero.}

Our case study are nonrotating thin-shell gravastars. The model has an infinitely thin shell with finite tension separating a de Sitter interior and a Schwarzschild exterior. The shell can be located arbitrarily close to the would-be event horizon, so a gravastar might seem indistinguishable from a black hole when tests are only performed on its external metric. We discuss gravitational perturbations of thin-shell gravastars and show that the spectrum of axial and polar quasinormal modes is completely different from that of a Schwarzschild black hole, even in the limit when the surface redshift becomes infinite. Furthermore, we study gravitational wave emission from the quasi-circular extreme mass ratio inspiral of compact objects of mass m0 into massive thin-shell gravastars of mass M ≫ m0. The power radiated in gravitational waves during the inspiral shows distinctive peaks corresponding to the excitation of the polar oscillation modes of the gravastar. The frequency of these peaks usually depends on the equation of state, but for ultra-compact gravastars it typically lies within the optimal sensitivity bandwidth of LISA, providing a very specific signature of the horizonless nature of the central object.}

	abstract = {Gravastars have been recently proposed as potential alternatives to explain the astrophysical phenomenology traditionally associated with black holes, raising the question of whether the two objects can be distinguished at all. Leaving aside the debate about the processes that would lead to the formation of a gravastar and the astronomical evidence in their support, here we address two basic questions: is a gravastar stable against generic perturbations? If it is stable, can an observer distinguish it from a black hole of the same mass? To answer these questions we construct a general class of gravastars and determine the conditions they must satisfy in order to exist as equilibrium solutions of the Einstein equations. For such models we perform a systematic stability analysis against axial perturbations, computing the real and imaginary parts of the eigenfrequencies. Overall, we find that gravastars are stable to axial perturbations, but also that their quasi-normal modes differ from those of a black hole of the same mass and thus can be used to discern, beyond dispute, a gravastar from a black hole.}

The authors have recently shown that typical rapidly spinning gravastars and boson stars develop a strong instability. That analysis is extended in this paper to a wide class of horizonless objects with approximate Kerr-like geometry. A detailed investigation of wormholes and superspinars is presented, using plausible models and mirror boundary conditions at the surface. Like gravastars and boson stars, these objects are unstable with very short instability timescales. This result strengthens previous conclusions that observed hyper-compact astrophysical objects with large rotation are likely to be black holes.}

abstract = {Compact object perturbations, at linear order, often lead in solving one or more coupled wave equations. The study of these equations was typically done by numerical or semi-analytical methods. The WKB method and the associated Bohr–Sommerfeld rule have proved extremely useful tools in the study of black-hole perturbations and the estimation of the related quasi-normal modes. Here we present an extension of the aforementioned semi-analytic methods in the study of perturbations of ultra-compact stars and gravastars.}

abstract = {The simplicity of black holes, as characterized by no-hair theorems, is one of the most important mathematical results in the framework of general relativity. Are these theorems unique to black hole spacetimes, or do they also constrain the geometry around regions of spacetime with arbitrarily large (although finite) redshift? This paper presents a systematic study of this question and illustrates that no-hair theorems are not restricted to spacetimes with event horizons but are instead characteristic of spacetimes with deep enough gravitational wells, extending Israel’s theorem to static spacetimes without event horizons that contain small deviations from spherical symmetry. Instead of a uniqueness result, we obtain a theorem that constrains the allowed deviations from the Schwarzschild metric and guarantees that these deviations decrease with the maximum redshift of the gravitational well in the external vacuum region. Israel’s theorem is recovered continuously in the limit of infinite redshift. This result provides a first extension of no-hair theorems to ultracompact stars, wormholes, and other exotic objects, and paves the way for the construction of similar results for stationary spacetimes describing rotating objects.}

abstract = { The problem of axially symmetric fields was first treated by {Weyl}, who succeeded in obtaining solutions for a static field in terms of the Newtonian potential of a distribution of matter in an associated canonical space. He also solved the more general problem involving the electric field. Levi Civita, by slightly different methods, obtained solutions differing from those of {Weyl} in one respect, and discussed fully the case in which the field is produced by an infinite cylinder. R. Bach has discussed the special case of two spheres and has calculated their mutual attraction. Bach also considered the field of a slowly rotating sphere, and obtained approximate solutions, taking the Schwarz child solution as his zero-th approximation. The same field was discussed earlier by Leuse and Thirring, who considered, the linear terms, only, in the gravitational equation. Kornel Lanczos has also considered a special case of stationary fields and applied the results to cosmological problems. The more general case of gravitational fields produced by matter in stationary rotation has been treated by W. R. Andress and E. Akeley. Both these authors obtain approximate solutions of the general problem, and the latter treats at length the field of a rotating fluid. The object of this paper is to present some special, but exact, solutions which the author obtained some years ago and, also, two methods of successive approximation for obtaining solutions of a more general type, which behave in an assigned manner at infinity and on a surface of revolution enclosing the rotating matter to which the field is due. Our solutions include as special cases the solutions of {Weyl}, Levi Civita and others which pertain to static fields. Also, the approximate solutions for stationary fields obtained by Leuse and Thirring, Bach and Andress are contained in our solutions when appropriate choice of boundary conditions is made and higher order terms are neglected. },

Here we first briefly describe the dynamics of LL-branes as test objects in various physically interesting gravitational backgrounds of black hole type, including rotating ones. Next we show that LL-branes are the appropriate gravitational sources that provide proper matter energy–momentum tensors in the Einstein equations of motion needed to generate traversable wormhole solutions, in particular, self-consistent cylindrical rotating wormholes, with the LL-branes occupying their throats. Here a major role is being played by the dynamical LL-brane tension which turns out to be negative but may be of arbitrary small magnitude. As a particular solution we obtain traversable wormhole with Schwarzschild geometry generated by a LL-brane positioned at the wormhole throat, which represents the correct consistent realization of the original Einstein–Rosen "bridge" manifold. }

These recently found analytical solutions exhibit a negative pressure region in their centre and, in the limit when , the full interior region of the star becomes filled with negative pressure. Here we present a systematic analysis of the stability of these configurations against radial perturbations. We found that, contrary to the usual expectation found in many classical works, the ultra compact Schwarzschild star is stable against radial oscillations. We computed values of the critical adiabatic index  for several stellar models with varying radius  and found that it also approaches a finite value as .}

	abstract = {One of the macroscopically measurable effects of gravity is the tidal deformability of astrophysical objects, which can be quantified by their tidal Love numbers. For planets and stars, these numbers measure the resistance of their material against the tidal forces, and the resulting contribution to their gravitational multipole moments. According to general relativity, nonrotating deformed black holes, instead, show no addition to their gravitational multipole moments, and all of their Love numbers are zero. In this paper we explore different configurations of nonrotating compact and ultracompact stars to bridge the compactness gap between black holes and neutron stars and calculate their Love number k 2. We calculate k 2 for the first time for uniform density ultracompact stars with mass M and radius R beyond the Buchdahl limit (compactness M/R > 4/9), and we find that k 2 → 0+ as M/R → 1/2, i.e., the Schwarzschild black hole limit. Our results provide insight on the zero tidal deformability limit and we use current constraints on the binary tidal deformability from GW170817 (and future upper limits from binary black hole mergers) to propose tests of alternative models.}

	abstract = {Hartle's model describes the equilibrium configuration of a rotating isolated compact body in perturbation theory up to second order in general relativity. The interior of the body is a perfect fluid with a barotropic equation of state, no convective motions and rigid rotation. That interior is matched across its surface to an asymptotically flat vacuum exterior. Perturbations are taken to second order around a static and spherically symmetric background configuration. Apart from the explicit assumptions, the perturbed configuration is constructed upon some implicit premises, in particular the continuity of the functions describing the perturbation in terms of some background radial coordinate. In this work we revisit the model within a modern general and consistent theory of perturbative matchings to second order, which is independent of the coordinates and gauges used to describe the two regions to be joined. We explore the matching conditions up to second order in full. The main particular result we present is that the radial function m0 (in the setting of the original work) of the second order perturbation tensor, contrary to the original assumption, presents a jump at the surface of the star, which is proportional to the value of the energy density of the background configuration there. As a consequence, the change in mass needed by the perturbed configuration to keep the value of the central energy density unchanged must be amended. We also discuss some subtleties that arise when studying the deformation of the star.}

This entails regularizing the gravitational part of the corresponding supergravity action in a manner consistent with general covariance. Up to a constant, the anomaly only depends on the dimension d of the manifold on which the conformal field theory is defined. We present concrete expressions for the anomaly in the physically relevant cases d = 2,4 and 6. In d = 2 we find for the central charge c = 3l/2GN, in agreement with considerations based on the asymptotic symmetry algebra of adS3. In d = 4 the anomaly agrees precisely with that of the corresponding 𝒩 = 4 superconformal SU(N) gauge theory. The result in d = 6 provides new information for the (0, 2) theory, since its {Weyl} anomaly has not been computed previously. The anomaly in this case grows as N3, where N is the number of coincident M5 branes, and it vanishes for a Ricci-flat background.}

It is unstable under small perturbations which may cause a breakdown of the de {Sitter} symmetry. The de {Sitter} string sigma model is discussed. It is argued that the gauge theory at the complex coupling is dual to the matrix elements of vertex operators in the de {Sitter} space, taken between the Bunch–Davies vacuum and the “out” state without particles. The described infrared effects are likely to screen away the cosmological constant."

These are then used to compute a finite stress tensor by the technique of covariant point-splitting. We propose a renormalization ansatz based on the DeWitt-Schwinger expansion, and show that this removes all ambiguities previously present in point-splitting regularization. The results agree in detail with previous work by dimensional regularization, and give rise to an anomalous trace with the conventional coefficient. We describe how our treatment may be extended to more general situations.},

abstract = {For massless ϕ4 theory, we explicitly compute the lowest order non-local contributions to the one-loop effective action required for the determination of the trace anomaly. Imposing exact conformal invariance of the local part of the effective action, we argue that the issue of quadratic divergences does not arise in a theory where exact conformal symmetry is only broken by quantum effects. Conformal symmetry can thus replace low energy supersymmetry as a possible guide towards stabilizing the weak scale and solving the hierarchy problem, if (i) there are no intermediate scales between the weak scale and the Planck scale, and (ii) the running couplings exhibit neither Landau poles nor instabilities over this whole range of energies.}

We proceed by introducing two auxiliary fields, which are capable of describing a diversity of quantum states via specification of their macroscopic (IR) boundary conditions, in contrast to ultraviolet quantum effects. Our investigation aims at finding a realistic cosmological solution which interprets the observed cosmological constant as a well defined deficit in the zero point energy density of the Universe. The energy density arises from a phase transition, which alters the properties of the quantum ground state. We explicitly formulate low energy gravity as an effective field theory with a precise definition of the ``point of normalization" as the point at which the ``renormalized cosmological constant" is set to zero in the Minkowski vacuum, in which the Einstein equations are automatically satisfied as the Ricci tensor identically vanishes. With this definition the effective QFT of gravity has a predictive power. In particular, it must predict the evolution of the system in any nontrivial geometry, including the vacuum energy behaviour as a function of infrared, rather than ultraviolet, input parameters.}

In particular, this technique is extended to nonminimal but causal operators of any order. All calculations are carried out in a universal manner using only the form of the commutator of covariant derivatives. We show that one can even tabulate the universal loop graphs and present a table of a certain class of such graphs. The article can also serve as a reference book on the divergences of one-loop graphs. In particular, we present a complete algorithm for divergences in the determinant of the fourth-order operator. The calculational methods are developed for the recently proposed unique effective action in gauge theories. The unique counterterms in Einstein's theory are computed, and the question of asymptotic freedom in this theory is reexamined.}

abstract={Gravity and general relativity are considered as an Effective Field Theory (EFT) at low energies and macroscopic distances. The effective action of the conformal anomaly of light or massless quantum fields has significant effects on macroscopic scales, due to associated light cone singularities that are not captured by an expansion in local curvature invariants. A compact local form for the Wess-Zumino effective action of the conformal anomaly and stress tensor is given, requiring the introduction of a new light scalar field, which it is argued should be included in the low energy effective action for gravity. This scalar conformalon couples to the conformal part of the spacetime metric and allows the effective value of the vacuum energy, described as a condensate of an exact 4-form abelian gauge field strength F = dA, to change in space and time. This is achieved by the identification of the torsion dependent part of the Chern-Simons 3-form of the Euler class with the gauge potential A, which enters the effective action of the conformal anomaly as a J {\textperiodcentered} A interaction analogous to electromagnetism. The conserved 3-current J describes the worldtube of 2-surfaces that separate regions of differing vacuum energy. The resulting EFT thus replaces the fixed constant $\Lambda$ of classical gravity, and its apparently unnaturally large sensitivity to UV physics, with a dynamical condensate whose ground state value in empty flat space is $\Lambda$eff = 0 identically. By allowing $\Lambda$eff to vary rapidly near the 2-surface of a black hole horizon, the proposed EFT of dynamical vacuum energy provides an effective Lagrangian framework for gravitational condensate stars, as the final state of complete gravitational collapse consistent with quantum theory. The possible consequences of dynamical vacuum dark energy for cosmology, the cosmic coincidence problem, and the role of conformal invariance for other fine tuning issues in the Standard Model are discussed.},

However, there is a simple proof in statistical mechanics that specific heats are positive. This paradox, first resolved by Thirring, is further explored with a simple model which obeys the virial theorem. The great differences that can arise between Gibbs's canonical ensembles and microcanonical ensembles are thereby further illustrated. If the model is treated canonically it shows a remarkable giant phase transition which replaces a wide zone of negative specific heat found by microcanonical approach.This behaviour suggested to us that the origin of all normal phase transitions may lie in negative-specific-heat elements that only arise at a microscopic level. A simple model of a chemical reaction or ionization demonstrates that this is a correct interpretation of these transitions.}",

The origin of the anomalies is the existence of a superconvergence sum rule for the imaginary part of the relevant formfactor. In the zero mass limit the imaginary part of the formfactor approaches a δ-function singularity at zero momentum squared, exhibiting in this way the infrared feature of the gravitational anomalies. We find an equivalence between the dispersive approach and the dimensional regularization procedure. The Schwinger terms appearing in the equal time commutators of the energy momentum tensors can be calculated by the same dispersive method. Although all computations are performed in two dimensions the method is expected to work in higher dimensions too.}

abstract={In the point-splitting prescription for renormalizing the stress-energy tensor of a scalar field in curved spacetime, it is assumed that the anticommutator expectation valueG(x, x{\textasciiacutex})={\textlangle}{\o}(x){\o}(x{\textasciiacutex})+{\o}(x{\textasciiacutex}){\o}(x){\textrangle} has a singularity of the Hadamard form asx{\textrightarrow}x{\textasciiacutex}. We prove here that ifG(x,x{\textasciiacutex}) has the Hadamard singularity structure in an open neighborhood of a Cauchy surface, then it does so everywhere, i.e., Cauchy evolution preserves the Hadamard singularity structure. In particular, in a spacetime which is flat below a Cauchy surface, for the ``in'' vacuum stateG(x,x{\textasciiacutex}) is of the Hadamard form everywhere, and thus the point-splitting prescription in this case has been rigorously shown to give meaningful, finite answers.},

abstract = {Astrophysical black holes are expected to be described by the Kerr metric. This is the only stationary, vacuum, axisymmetric metric, without electromagnetic charge, that satisfies Einstein’s equations and does not have pathologies outside of the event horizon. We present new constraints on potential deviations from the Kerr prediction based on 2017 EHT observations of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). We calibrate the relationship between the geometrically defined black hole shadow and the observed size of the ring-like images using a library that includes both Kerr and non-Kerr simulations. We use the exquisite prior constraints on the mass-to-distance ratio for Sgr A* to show that the observed image size is within ∼10% of the Kerr predictions. We use these bounds to constrain metrics that are parametrically different from Kerr, as well as the charges of several known spacetimes. To consider alternatives to the presence of an event horizon, we explore the possibility that Sgr A* is a compact object with a surface that either absorbs and thermally reemits incident radiation or partially reflects it. Using the observed image size and the broadband spectrum of Sgr A*, we conclude that a thermal surface can be ruled out and a fully reflective one is unlikely. We compare our results to the broader landscape of gravitational tests. Together with the bounds found for stellar-mass black holes and the M87 black hole, our observations provide further support that the external spacetimes of all black holes are described by the Kerr metric, independent of their mass.}

journal = {Astrophys. Jour. Lett.},
abstract = {Observations have found black holes spanning 10 orders of magnitude in mass across most of cosmic history. The Kerr black hole solution is, however, provisional as its behavior at infinity is incompatible with an expanding universe. Black hole models with realistic behavior at infinity predict that the gravitating mass of a black hole can increase with the expansion of the universe independently of accretion or mergers, in a manner that depends on the black hole’s interior solution. We test this prediction by considering the growth of supermassive black holes in elliptical galaxies over 0 &lt; z ≲ 2.5. We find evidence for cosmologically coupled mass growth among these black holes, with zero cosmological coupling excluded at 99.98% confidence. The redshift dependence of the mass growth implies that, at z ≲ 7, black holes contribute an effectively constant cosmological energy density to Friedmann’s equations. The continuity equation then requires that black holes contribute cosmologically as vacuum energy. We further show that black hole production from the cosmic star formation history gives the value of ΩΛ measured by Planck while being consistent with constraints from massive compact halo objects. We thus propose that stellar remnant black holes are the astrophysical origin of dark energy, explaining the onset of accelerating expansion at z ∼ 0.7.}

abstract="These lecture notes review the foundations and some applications of light-cone quantization. First I explain how to choose a time in special relativity. Inclusion of Poincar{\'e} invariance naturally leads to Dirac's forms of relativistic dynamics. Among these, the front form, being the basis for light-cone quantization, is my main focus. I explain a few of its peculiar features such as boost and Galilei invariance or separation of relative and center-of-mass motion. Combining light-cone dynamics and field quantization results in light-cone quantum field theory. As the latter represents a first-order system, quantization is somewhat nonstandard. I address this issue using Schwinger's quantum action principle, the method of Faddeev and Jackiw, and the functional Schr{\"o}dinger picture. A finite-volume formulation, discretized light-cone quantization, is analysed in detail. I point out some problems with causality, which are absent in infinite volume. Finally, the triviality of the light-cone vacuum is established. Coming to applications, I introduce the notion of light-cone wave functions as the solutions of the light-cone Schr{\"o}dinger equation. I discuss some examples, among them nonrelativistic Coulomb systems and model field theories in two dimensions. Vacuum properties (like chiral condensates) are reconstructed from the particle spectrum obtained by solving the light-cone Schr{\"o}dinger equation. In a last application, I make contact with phenomenology by calculating the pion wave function within the Nambu and Jona-Lasinio model. I am thus able to predict a number of observables like the pion charge and core radius, the r.m.s. transverse momentum, the pion structure function and the pion distribution amplitude. The latter turns out to be the asymptotic one.",

abstract = {We study the magnitude of semiclassical gravity effects near the formation of a black-hole horizon in spherically-symmetric spacetimes. As a probe for these effects we use a quantised massless scalar field. Specifically, we calculate two quantities derived from it: the renormalised stress–energy tensor (a measure of how the field vacuum state affects the spacetime) and the effective temperature function (a generalisation of Hawking temperature related to the energy flux of the field vacuum). The subject of our study are spacetimes which contain a spherical distribution of matter and an empty exterior Schwarzschild region, separated by a surface which is moving in proximity to the Schwarzschild radius , with M the total mass. In particular, we analyse the consequences of three types of surface movement: an oscillation just above , a monotonous approach towards  in infinite time and a crossing of  at different velocities. For a collapsing matter distribution which follows the expected dynamical evolution in general relativity, we recover the standard picture of black-hole formation and its tenuous semiclassical effects. In more general dynamical regimes, allowing deviations from the standard classical evolution, we obtain a variety of different effects: from the emission of Hawking-like radiation without the formation of a horizon, to large values of the renormalised stress–energy tensor, related to the Boulware vacuum divergence in static spacetimes.}

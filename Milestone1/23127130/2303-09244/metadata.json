    "abstract": "According to the wave-particle duality (WPD), quantum systems show both particle- and wave-like behavior, and cannot be described using only one of these classical concepts. Identifying quantum features that cannot be reproduced by any classical means is key for quantum technology. This task is often pursued by comparing the quantum system of interest to a suitable classical counterpart. However, the WPD implies that a comparison to a single classical model is generally insufficient; at least one wave and one particle model should be considered. Here we exploit this insight and contrast a bosonic quantum heat engine with two classical counterparts, one based on waves and one based on particles. While both classical models reproduce the average output power of the quantum engine, neither reproduces its fluctuations. The wave model fails to capture the vacuum fluctuations while the particle model cannot reproduce bunching to its full extent. We find regimes where wave and particle descriptions agree with the quantum one, as well as a regime where neither classical model is adequate, revealing the role of the WPD in non-equilibrium bosonic transport.",

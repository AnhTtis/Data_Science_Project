	abstract = {Quantum Thermodynamics is a continuous dialogue between two independent theories: Thermodynamics and Quantum Mechanics. Whenever the two theories have addressed the same phenomena new insight has emerged. We follow the dialogue from equilibrium Quantum Thermodynamics and the notion of entropy and entropy inequalities which are the base of the II-law. Dynamical considerations lead to non-equilibrium thermodynamics of quantum Open Systems. The central part played by completely positive maps is discussed leading to the Gorini--Kossakowski--Lindblad--Sudarshan ``GKLS'' equation. We address the connection to thermodynamics through the system-bath weak-coupling-limit WCL leading to dynamical versions of the I-law. The dialogue has developed through the analysis of quantum engines and refrigerators. Reciprocating and continuous engines are discussed. The autonomous quantum absorption refrigerator is employed to illustrate the III-law. Finally, we describe some open questions and perspectives.},

  abstract   = {Complex physical dynamics can often be modeled as a Markov jump process between mesoscopic configurations. When jumps between mesoscopic states are mediated by thermodynamic reservoirs, the time-irreversibility of the jump process is a measure of the physical dissipation. We rederive a recently introduced inequality relating the dissipation rate to current fluctuations in jump processes. We then adapt these results to diffusion processes via a limiting procedure, reaffirming that diffusions saturate the inequality. Finally, we study the impact of spatial coarse-graining in a two-dimensional model with driven diffusion. By observing fluctuations in coarse-grained currents, it is possible to infer a lower bound on the total dissipation rate, including the dissipation associated with hidden dynamics. The tightness of this bound depends on how well the spatial coarse-graining detects dynamical events that are driven by large thermodynamic forces.},

The system's energy can also be changed by performing non-adiabatic work using a cyclic process. Almost nothing is known about the resulting energy distribution in this set-up, which is in particular relevant to recent experimental progress in cold atoms, ion traps, superconducting qubits and other systems. Here we show that when the non-adiabatic process consists of many repeated cyclic processes, the resulting energy distribution is universal and different from the Gibbs ensemble. We predict the existence of two qualitatively different regimes with a continuous second-order-like transition between them. We illustrate our approach by performing explicit calculations for both interacting and non-interacting systems. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The concept of coherence which has conventionally been used in optics is found to be inadequate to the needs of recently opened areas of experiment. To provide a fuller discussion of coherence, a succession of correlation functions for the complex 6eld strengths is de6ned. The nth order function expresses the correlation of values of the fields at 2n different points of space and time. Certain values of these functions are measurable by means of n-fold delayed coincidence detection of photons. A fully coherent field is defined as one whose correlation functions satisfy an in6nite succession of stated conditions. Various orders of incomplete coherence are distinguished, according to the number of coherence conditions actually satis6ed. It is noted that the 6elds historically described as coherent in optics have only first-order coherence. On the other hand, the existence, in principle, of 6elds coherent to all orders is shown both in quantum theory and classical theory. The methods used in these discussions apply to fields of arbitrary time dependence. It is shown, as a result, that coherence does not require monochromaticity. Coherent fields can be generated with arbitrary spectra.},

  abstract  = {Single quantum dots are solid-state emitters which mimic two-level atoms but with a highly enhanced spontaneous emission rate. A single quantum dot is the basis for a potentially excellent single photon source. One outstanding problem is that there is considerable noise in the emission frequency, making it very difficult to couple the quantum dot to another quantum system. We solve this problem here with a dynamic feedback technique that locks the quantum dot emission frequency to a reference. The incoherent scattering (resonance fluorescence) represents the single photon output whereas the coherent scattering (Rayleigh scattering) is used for the feedback control. The fluctuations in emission frequency are reduced to 20 MHz, just ~ 5 of the quantum dot optical linewidth, even over several hours. By eliminating the 1/f-like noise, the relative fluctuations in resonance fluorescence intensity are reduced to ~ 10E-5 at low frequency. Under these conditions, the antibunching dip in the resonance fluorescence is described extremely well by the two-level atom result. The technique represents a way of removing charge noise from a quantum device.},

We investigate noise in an ultrapure semiconductor device using a minimally invasive, ultrasensitive local probe: resonance fluorescence from a single quantum dot. We distinguish between charge noise and spin noise through a crucial difference in their optical signatures. Noise spectra for both electric and magnetic fields are derived from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz. The charge noise dominates at low frequencies, spin noise at high frequencies. The noise falls rapidly with increasing frequency, allowing us to demonstrate transform-limited quantum-dot optical linewidths by operating the device above 50 kHz. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

This can be done by making use of the macroscopic quantum coherence intrinsic to superconducting condensates, which manifests itself through the Josephson effect and the proximity effect. Here, we review recent experimental results obtained in the realization of heat interferometers and thermal rectifiers, and discuss a few proposals for exotic nonlinear phase-coherent caloritronic devices, such as thermal transistors, solid-state memories, phase-coherent heat splitters, microwave refrigerators, thermal engines and heat valves. Besides being attractive from the fundamental physics point of view, these systems are expected to have a vast impact on many cryogenic microcircuits requiring energy management, and possibly lay the first stone for the foundation of electronic thermal logic.},

Fluctuations involving a small fraction of a statistical ensemble of systems interacting with the bath result in deviations from this trend. In this respect, quantum and classical thermodynamics are in agreement. Here we predict a different trend in a purely quantum mechanical setting: disturbances of thermal equilibrium between two-level systems (TLSs) and a bath, caused by frequent, brief quantum non-demolition measurements of the TLS energy states. By making the measurements increasingly frequent, we encounter first the anti-Zeno regime and then the Zeno regime (namely where the TLSs' relaxation respectively speeds up and slows down). The corresponding entropy and temperature of both the system and the bath are then found to either decrease or increase depending only on the rate of observation, contrary to the standard thermodynamical rules that hold for memory-less (Markov) baths. From a practical viewpoint, these anomalies may offer the possibility of very fast control of heat and entropy in quantum systems, allowing cooling and state purification over an interval much shorter than the time needed for thermal equilibration or for a feedback control loop. ©2008 Nature Publishing Group.},

A striking illustration is the quantum delayed-choice experiment, which is based on Wheeler’s classic delayed-choice gedanken experiment, but with the addition of a quantum-controlled device enabling wave-to-particle transitions. Here, we realize a quantum delayed-choice experiment in which we control the wave and the particle states of photons and particularly the phase between them, thus directly establishing the created quantum nature of the wave–particle. We generate three-photon entangled states and inject one photon into a Mach–Zehnder interferometer embedded in a 186-m-long two-photon Hong–Ou–Mandel interferometer. The third photon is sent 141 m away from the interferometers and remotely prepares a two-photon quantum gate according to independent active choices under Einstein locality conditions. We realize transitions between wave and particle states in both classical and quantum scenarios, and therefore tests of the complementarity principle that go fundamentally beyond earlier implementations.},

  abstract = {The effect of the environment on a quantum system is studied on an exactly solvable model: a harmonic oscillator interacting with a one-dimensional massless scalar field. We show that in an open quantum system, dissipation can cause decorrelation on a time scale significantly shorter than the relaxation time which characterizes the approach of the system to thermodynamic equilibrium. In particular, we demonstrate that the density matrix decays rapidly toward a mixture of "approxi-mate eigenstates" of the "pointer observable, " which commutes with the system-environment interaction Hamiltonian. This observable can be regarded as continuously, if inaccurately, monitored by the scalar field environment. Both because in a harmonic oscillator the state of the system rotates in the phase space and because the effective environment "measurement" is weak, the system, on the short "collision" time scale (1/I"), maintains a coherence in this pointer observable on time scales of order [y/Bin(1 /0)]'~ and on longer time scales settles into a mixture of coherent states with a dispersion approximately consistent with the vacuum state. The master equation satisfied by the exact solution differs from the other master equations derived both for the high-temperature limit and for T =0. We discuss these differences and study the transition region between the high-and low-temperature regimes. We also consider the behavior of the system in the short-time "tran-sient" regime. For T =0, we find that, in the long-time limit, the system behaves as if it were subject to "1!fnoise. " The generality of our model is considered and its predictions are compared with previous treatments of related problems. Some of the possible applications of the results to experimentally realizable situations are outlined. The significance of the environment-induced reduction of the wave packet for cosmological models is also briefiy considered.},

  abstract     = {Quantum superposition lies at the heart of quantum mechanics and gives rise to many of its paradoxes. Superposition of de Broglie matter waves 1 has been observed for massive particles such as electrons 2 , atoms and dimers 3 , small van der Waals clusters 4 , and neutrons 5. But matter wave interferometry with larger objects has remained experimentally challenging, despite the development of powerful atom interferometric techniques for experiments in fundamental quantum mechanics, metrology and lithography 6. Here we report the observation of de Broglie wave interference of C 60 molecules by diffraction at a material absorption grating. This molecule is the most massive and complex object in which wave behaviour has been observed. Of particular interest is the fact that C 60 is almost a classical body, because of its many excited internal degrees of freedom and their possible couplings to the environment. Such couplings are essential for the appearance of decoherence 7,8 , suggesting that interference experiments with large molecules should facilitate detailed studies of this process. When considering de Broglie wave phenomena of larger and more complex objects than atoms, fullerenes come to mind as suitable candidates. After their discovery 9 and the subsequent invention of efficient mass-production methods 10 , they became easily available. In our experiment (see Fig. 1) we use commercial, 99. pure, C 60 fullerenes (Dynamic Enterprises Ltd, Twyford, UK) which were sublimated in an oven at temperatures between 900 and 1,000 K. The emerging molecular beam passed through two collimation slits, each about 10 m wide, separated by a distance of 1.04 m. Then it traversed a free-standing nanofabricated SiN x grating 11 consisting of nominally 50-nm-wide slits with a 100-nm period. At a further distance of 1.25 m behind the diffraction grating, the interference pattern was observed using a spatially resolving detector. It consisted of a beam from a visible argon-ion laser (24 W all lines), focused to a gaussian waist of 8 m width (this is the size required for the light intensity to drop to 1/e 2 of that in the centre of the beam). The light beam was directed vertically, parallel both to the lines of the diffraction grating and to the collimation slits. By using a suitable mirror assembly, the focus could be scanned with micrometre resolution across the interference pattern. The absorbed light then ionized the C 60 fullerenes via heating and subsequent thermal emission of electrons 12. The detection region was found to be smaller than 1 mm in height, consistent with a full Rayleigh length of 800 m and the strong power dependence of this ionization process. A significant advantage of the thermionic mechanism is that it does not detect any of the residual gases present in the vacuum chamber. We could thus achieve dark count rates of less than one per second even under moderately high vacuum conditions (5 10 7 mbar). The fullerene ions were then focused by an optimized ion lens system, and accelerated to a BeCu conversion electrode at −9 kV where they induced the emission of electrons which were subsequently amplified by a Channeltron detector. Alignment is a crucial part of this experiment. In order to be able to find the beam in the first place, our collimation apertures are movable piezo slits that can be opened from 0 to 60 m (in the case of the first slit) and from 0 to 200 m (for the second slit). The vacuum chamber is rigidly mounted on an optical table together with the ionizing laser, in order to minimize spatial drifts. The effect of gravity also had to be considered in our setup. For the most probable velocity (220 m s −1), the fullerenes fall by 0.7 mm while traversing the apparatus. This imposes a constraint on the maximum tilt that the grating may have with respect to gravity. As a typical diffraction angle into the first-order maximum is 25 rad, one can tolerate a tilt angle of (at most) about one mrad before molecules start falling from one diffraction order into the trajectory of a neighbouring order of a different velocity class. The experimental curves start to become asymmetric as soon as the grating tilt deviates by more than 500 rad from its optimum vertical orientation. The interference pattern of Fig. 2a clearly exhibits the central maximum and the first-order diffraction peaks. The minima between zeroth and first orders are well developed, and are due to destructive interference of C 60 de Broglie waves passing through neighbouring slits of the grating. For comparison, we show in Fig. 2b the profile of the undiffracted collimated beam. The velocity distribution has been measured independently by a time-of-flight method; it can be well fitted by f ðvÞ ¼ v 3 expð ðv v 0 Þ 2 =v 2 m Þ, with v 0 ¼ 166 m s 1 and v m ¼ 92 m s 1 as expected for a transition between a maxwellian effusive beam and a supersonic beam 13. The most probable velocity was v ¼ 220 m s 1 , corresponding to a de Broglie wavelength of 2.5 pm. The full-width at half-maximum was as broad as 60, resulting in a longitudinal coherence length of about 5 pm. The essential features of the interference pattern can be understood using standard Kirchhoff diffraction theory 14 for a grating with a period of 100 nm, by taking into account both the finite width of the collimation and the experimentally determined velocity distribution. The parameters in the fit were the width of the collimation, the gap width s 0 of a single slit opening, the effective beam width of the detection laser and an overall scaling factor. This model, assuming all grating slits to be perfect and identical, reproduces very well the central peak of the interference pattern shown in Fig. 2a, but does not fit the 'wings' of this pattern. Agreement with the experimental data, including the 'wings' in letters to nature 680},

Recently, an elegant relation between quantum coherence and path information has been theoretically derived. Here, we experimentally test such new duality by l1-norm measure and the minimum-error state discrimination. We prepare three classes of two-photon states encoded in polarisation degree of freedom, with one photon serving as the target and the other photon as the detector. We observe that wave-particle-like complementarity and Bagan’s equality, defined by the duality relation between coherence and path information, is well satisfied.

  abstract = {The rate at which pure initial states deteriorate into mixtures is computed for a harmonic oscillator interacting with an environment in thermal equilibrium. The decoherence process resulting from this interaction selects a set of states characterized by maximal stability (or minimal loss of predictive power) which can be quantified by the rate of increase in either linear or statistical entropy. In the weak coupling limit, coherent states are shown to produce the least entropy, thus becoming the natural counterparts of classical points in phase space. PACS numbers: 03.65.Bz, 05.30.-d, 05.40.+j Coherent states were introduced into physics primarily because of mathematical convenience [1,2]. Later, it was noticed that these states have several unusual properties which allow them to play a special role whenever a harmonic motion is a good approximation. For example, in quantum optics their role is tied to mathematics, but also to physics, as they are naturally generated by a laser and prepared by a typical means of measurement (such as a photomultiplier [3]). Here we shall show that coherent states have one more remarkable property: When the harmonic oscillator is weakly coupled to a canonical (oscillator-heat bath) environment, coherent states are least susceptible to the loss of quantum coherence. Schrodinger [1] suggested very early on that coherent states are the quantum counterparts of classical points in phase space. His argument was based on the stability and invariance of a Gaussian wave packet in an isolated quantum harmonic oscillator. It preceded the realization of many of the difficulties encountered in the interpretation of quantum mechanics. The hope that analogous counterparts of classical trajectories could be found for a general quantum system soon disappeared, in part as a result of persistent questioning by Bohr [4]. When the true nature of the difficulties posed by the conAict between the quantum superposition principle and its apparent violations in the "real world" (in particular, in the course of the quantum measurement process) became apparent [5], this naive first attempt proved to be clearly inadequate. Recent discussions of the transition between the quan-turn substrate and the familiar classical reality have fo-cused on the "openness" of macroscopic quantum systems [6], the stability of various quantum states in the presence of an environment [7-9], and the resulting process of decoherence [9-13]. The question addressed by these considerations goes back at least to Einstein, who (in a letter to Born), inquired about the apparent absence of the majority of quantum states admissible in the Hilbert space from familiar, everyday experience [14]. The answer to such questions emerges naturally once the role played by the environment in the transition from quantum to classical is acknowledged: Macroscopic quantum objects are nearly impossible to isolate from their surroundings. It was shown for various idealized models (invented primarily to study the "reduction of the state vector" in the context of idealized measurements) that, when the environment-that is, degrees of freedom which interact with the record-keeping "pointer" of a quantum apparatus-is taken into account, the vast majority of pure states become in effect inaccessible [7-9]. This is because a continuous interaction with the environment destroys, on a very short decoherence time scale, the purity of nearly all of the initial superpositions. Thus, only the observations which refer to a preferred set of stable states or the associated set of observables will exhibit one of the key attributes of "classical reality, "-the predictive power of the associated records. Such an interaction can be thought of as a continuous monitoring of the macroscopic quantum system by the environment. Neglecting the self-Hamiltonian of the sys},

In this work, with a designed asymmetric beam interference and by utilizing the polarization degree of freedom of the photon as a which-way detector, we experimentally confirm both forms of the duality relations.

This idea has been formulated quantitively as an inequality, e.g., by Englert and Jaeger, Shimony, and Vaidman, which upper bounds the sum of the interference visibility and the path distinguishability. Such wave-particle duality relations (WPDRs) are often thought to be conceptually inequivalent to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, although this has been debated. Here we show that WPDRs correspond precisely to a modern formulation of the uncertainty principle in terms of entropies, namely the min- and max-entropies. This observation unifies two fundamental concepts in quantum mechanics. Furthermore, it leads to a robust framework for deriving novel WPDRs by applying entropic uncertainty relations to interferometric models. As an illustration, we derive a novel relation that captures the coherence in a quantum beam splitter.},

The first stage of our circuit includes the generation of heralded single photons by spontaneous four-wave mixing in a micro-ring cavity engineered for delivering a single-photon state in a unique temporal mode. The second stage comprises the implementation of DFG in a spiral waveguide with controlled dispersion properties for reaching color qubit preparation fidelity close to unity. We present the generalized rotation operator related to the DFG process, a methodology for the device design, and qubit preparation fidelity results as a function of user-accessible parameters.},

  abstract  = {Quantum-mechanical effects at the macroscopic level were first explored in Josephson-junction-based superconducting circuits in the 1980s. In recent decades, the emergence of quantum information science has intensified research toward using these circuits as qubits in quantum information processors. The realization that superconducting qubits can be made to strongly and controllably interact with microwave photons, the quantized electromagnetic fields stored in superconducting circuits, led to the creation of the field of circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED), the topic of this review. While atomic cavity QED inspired many of the early developments of circuit QED, the latter has now become an independent and thriving field of research in its own right. Circuit QED allows the study and control of light-matter interaction at the quantum level in unprecedented detail. It also plays an essential role in all current approaches to gate-based digital quantum information processing with superconducting circuits. In addition, circuit QED provides a framework for the study of hybrid quantum systems, such as quantum dots, magnons, Rydberg atoms, surface acoustic waves, and mechanical systems interacting with microwave photons. Here the coherent coupling of superconducting qubits to microwave photons in high-quality oscillators focusing on the physics of the Jaynes-Cummings model, its dispersive limit, and the different regimes of light-matter interaction in this system are reviewed. Also discussed is coupling of superconducting circuits to their environment, which is necessary for coherent control and measurements in circuit QED, but which also invariably leads to decoherence. Dispersive qubit readout, a central ingredient in almost all circuit QED experiments, is also described. Following an introduction to these fundamental concepts that are at the heart of circuit QED, important use cases of these ideas in quantum information processing and in quantum optics are discussed. Circuit QED realizes a broad set of concepts that open up new possibilities for the study of quantum physics at the macro scale with superconducting circuits and applications to quantum information science in the widest sense.},

  abstract  = {Many emerging quantum technologies demand precise engineering and control over networks consisting of quantum mechanical degrees of freedom connected by propagating electromagnetic fields, or quantum input-output networks. Here we review recent progress in theory and experiment related to such quantum input-output networks, with a focus on the SLH framework, a powerful modeling framework for networked quantum systems that is naturally endowed with properties such as modularity and hierarchy. We begin by explaining the physical approximations required to represent any individual node of a network, e.g. atoms in cavity or a mechanical oscillator, and its coupling to quantum fields by an operator triple (S,L,H). Then we explain how these nodes can be composed into a network with arbitrary connectivity, including coherent feedback channels, using algebraic rules, and how to derive the dynamics of network components and output fields. The second part of the review discusses several extensions to the basic SLH framework that expand its modeling capabilities, and the prospects for modeling integrated implementations of quantum input-output networks. In addition to summarizing major results and recent literature, we discuss the potential applications and limitations of the SLH framework and quantum input-output networks, with the intention of providing context to a reader unfamiliar with the field.},

  abstract = {Short dephasing times pose one of the main challenges in realizing a quantum computer. Different approaches have been devised to cure this problem for superconducting qubits, a prime example being the operation of such devices at optimal working points, so-called "sweet spots." This latter approach led to significant improvement of T2 times in Cooper pair box qubits. Here, we introduce a new type of superconducting qubit called the "transmon." Unlike the charge qubit, the transmon is designed to operate in a regime of significantly increased ratio of Josephson energy and charging energy EJ EC. The transmon benefits from the fact that its charge dispersion decreases exponentially with EJ EC, while its loss in anharmonicity is described by a weak power law. As a result, we predict a drastic reduction in sensitivity to charge noise relative to the Cooper pair box and an increase in the qubit-photon coupling, while maintaining sufficient anharmonicity for selective qubit control. Our detailed analysis of the full system shows that this gain is not compromised by increased noise in other known channels. © 2007 The American Physical Society.},

The bunches are emitted at specific values Vk of the bias voltage, for which each Cooper pair tunneling across the junction creates exactly k photons in the resonator. The latter is a microfabricated spiral coil which resonates and leaks photons at 4.4 GHz in a measurement line. Its characteristic impedance of 1.97 kω is high enough to reach a strong junction-resonator coupling and a bright emission of the k-photon bunches. We show that a rotating-wave approximation treatment of the system accounts quantitatively for the observed radiation intensity, from k=1 to 6, and over 3 orders of magnitude when varying the Josephson energy EJ. We also measure the second-order correlation function of the radiated microwave to determine its Fano factor Fk, which in the low EJ limit confirms with Fk≃k the emission of k-photon bunches. At larger EJ, a more complex behavior is observed in quantitative agreement with numerical simulations.},

   abstract = {In the classical Hamiltonian formalism, the state of a mechanical system is given by a set of pairs of conjugated variables, of variables \{q j , p j \}, (j = 1, 2,. . .) referred to as coordinates and momenta, respectively. The equations of motion are generated with the Hamiltonian function, H(\{q j , p j \}), by the following axiom ˙ q j = ∂H ∂p j , (1) ˙ p j = − ∂H ∂q j. (2) Some times it proves reasonable to introduce complex variables \{a j \} related to \{q j , p j \} by a j = (αq j + iβp j) , (3) where α and β are some complex numbers (which can also depend on j, but we are not interested here in such a generalization). The equations of motion then acquire the form iλ ˙ a j = ∂H ∂a * j , (4) with λ = 1/(αβ * + α * β). That is each pair of real equations (1)-(2) is replaced with one complex equation (4). One may equivalently use the complex-conjugated equation −iλ ˙ a * j = ∂H/∂a j. Here we take into account that H is real. Poisson bracket, \{A, B\}, is a function of coordinates and momenta constructed from the two other functions, A(\{q j , p j \}) and B(\{q j , p j \}) by the following prescription: \{A, B\} = j ∂A ∂p j ∂B ∂q j − ∂A ∂q j ∂B ∂p j. (5) As is seen from (1)-(2)-and this is the most important property of the Poisson brackets,-for any function of coordinate and momenta, A(\{q j , p j \}, its time derivative during the evolution can be expressed as ˙ A = \{H, A\}. (6) In particular, if \{H, A\} ≡ 0, then the quantity A is a constant of motion.},

Quantum Langevin equations are developed, in which the Langevin forces are the field operators corresponding to the input modes. Time-reversed equations exist in which the Langevin forces are the output modes, and the sign of damping is reversed. Causality and boundary conditions relating inputs to system variables are developed. The concept of "quantum white noise" is formulated, and the formal relationship between quantum Langevin equations and quantum stochastic differential equations (SDE s) is established. In analogy to the classical formulation, there are two kinds of SDE's: the Ito and, the Strato-novich forms. Rules are developed for converting from one to the other. These rules depend on the nature of the quantum white noise, which may be squeezed. The SDE's developed are shown to be exactly equivalent to quantum master equations, and rules are developed for computing multitime-ordered correlation functions with use of the appropriate master equation. With use of the causality and boundary conditions, the relationship between correlation functions of the output and those of the system and the input is developed. It is possible to calculate what kind of output statistics result, provided that one knows the input statistics and provided that one can compute the system correlation functions.},

The Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation (TUR) provides a trade-off between output power, fluctuations and entropic cost. This trade-off may be overcome by systems exhibiting quantum coherence. This letter provides a study of the TUR in a prototypical quantum heat engine, the Scovil & Schulz-DuBois maser. Comparison with a classical reference system allows us to determine the effect of quantum coherence on the performance of the heat engine. We identify analytically regions where coherence suppresses fluctuations, implying a quantum advantage, as well as regions where fluctuations are enhanced by coherence. This quantum effect cannot be anticipated from the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix. Because the fluctuations are not encoded in the steady state alone, TUR violations are a consequence of coherence that goes beyond steady-state coherence. While the system violates the conventional TUR, it adheres a recent formulation of a quantum TUR. We further show that parameters where the engine operates close to the conventional limit are prevalent and TUR violations in the quantum model not uncommon.},

  abstract  = {The extension of thermodynamics into the quantum regime has received much attention in recent years. A primary objective of current research is to find thermodynamic tasks which can be enhanced by quantum mechanical effects. With this goal in mind, we explore the finite-time dynamics of absorption refrigerators composed of three quantum bits (qubits). The aim of this finite-time cooling is to reach low temperatures as fast as possible and subsequently extract the cold particle to exploit it for information processing purposes. We show that the coherent oscillations inherent to quantum dynamics can be harnessed to reach temperatures that are colder than the steady state in orders of magnitude less time, thereby providing a fast source of low-entropy qubits. This effect demonstrates that quantum thermal machines can surpass classical ones, reminiscent of quantum advantages in other fields, and is applicable to a broad range of technologically important scenarios.},

  abstract = {A general microscopic and macroscopic theory is developed for systems which are governed by a (linear) master equation. The theory is based on a network representation of the master equation, and the results are obtained mostly by application of some basic theorems of mathematical graph theory. In the microscopic part of the theory, the construction of a steady state solution of the master equation in terms of graph theoretical elements is, described (KirchhofFs theorem), and it is shown that the master equation satisfies a global asymptotic Liapunov stability criterion with respect to this state. The Cxlansdorff-Prigogine criterion turns out to be the differential version and thus a special case of the global criterion. In the macroscopic part of the theory, a general prescription is given describing macrostates of the systems arbitrarily fear from equilibrium in the language of generalized forces and fluxes of nonlinear irreversible thermodynamics. As a particular result, Onsager s reciprocity relations for the phenomenological coefficients are obtained as coinciding with the reciprocity relations of a near-to-equilibrium network.},

These fluctuations are however not taken into account in the traditional laws of thermodynamics. While the second law is extended to fluctuating systems by the celebrated fluctuation theorems, the first law is generally believed to hold even in the presence of fluctuations. Here we show that in the presence of quantum fluctuations, also the first law of thermodynamics may break down. This happens because quantum mechanics imposes constraints on the knowledge of heat and work. To illustrate our results, we provide a detailed case-study of work and heat fluctuations in a quantum heat engine based on a circuit QED architecture. We find probabilistic violations of the first law and show that they are closely connected to quantum signatures related to negative quasi-probabilities. Our results imply that in the presence of quantum fluctuations, the first law of thermodynamics may not be applicable to individual experimental runs.},

We observe a spontaneous energy flow from the cold to the hot system. This process is enabled by a trade off between correlations and entropy that we quantify with information-theoretical quantities. These results highlight the subtle interplay of quantum mechanics, thermodynamics and information theory. They further provide a mechanism to control heat on the microscale.},

  abstract     = {Heat transfer in solids is typically conducted through either electrons or atomic vibrations known as phonons. In a vacuum, heat has long been thought to be transferred by radiation but not by phonons because of the lack of a medium1. Recent theory, however, has predicted that quantum fluctuations of electromagnetic fields could induce phonon coupling across a vacuum and thereby facilitate heat transfer2–4. Revealing this unique quantum effect experimentally would bring fundamental insights to quantum thermodynamics5 and practical implications to thermal management in nanometre-scale technologies6. Here we experimentally demonstrate heat transfer induced by quantum fluctuations between two objects separated by a vacuum gap. We use nanomechanical systems to realize strong phonon coupling through vacuum fluctuations, and observe the exchange of thermal energy between individual phonon modes. The experimental observation agrees well with our theoretical calculations and is unambiguously distinguished from other effects such as near-field radiation and electrostatic interaction. Our discovery of phonon transport through quantum fluctuations represents a previously unknown mechanism of heat transfer in addition to the conventional conduction, convection and radiation. It paves the way for the exploitation of quantum vacuum in energy transport at the nanoscale.},

In this quest, a core problem is embodied by the understanding of the role that entanglement plays in processes of work extraction. Here, by considering information thermodynamics-based protocols, we answer the question "Is it possible to infer, quantitatively, quantum correlations by considering work-extraction schemes?". Our experimental settings consist of suitably designed multi-photon optical interferometers able to address the case of both bipartite and multipartite entangled states. We compare the performance of such criteria to that of witnesses of entanglement based on the violation of Bell-like tests, showing their inherently different nature.

A prominent platform for achieving the necessary manipulation of quantum states is superconducting circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED) 11 . In this platform, thermalization of a quantum system 12–15 can be achieved by interfacing the circuit QED subsystem with a thermal reservoir of appropriate Hilbert dimensionality. Here we study heat transport through an assembly consisting of a superconducting qubit 16 capacitively coupled between two nominally identical coplanar waveguide resonators, each equipped with a heat reservoir in the form of a normal-metal mesoscopic resistor termination. We report the observation of tunable photonic heat transport through the resonator–qubit–resonator assembly, showing that the reservoir-to-reservoir heat flux depends on the interplay between the qubit–resonator and the resonator–reservoir couplings, yielding qualitatively dissimilar results in different coupling regimes. Our quantum heat valve is relevant for the realization of quantum heat engines 17 and refrigerators, which can be obtained, for example, by exploiting the time-domain dynamics and coherence of driven superconducting qubits 18,19 . This effort would ultimately bridge the gap between the fields of quantum information and thermodynamics of mesoscopic systems.},

This fact probably added strength to the conjecture that in the limit of zero degeneracy a Bose-Einstein process reduces to a memoryless Poisson process. After considering some statistics related both to counting and to arrival times, we have experimentally verified that a Bose-Einstein process retains its correlation properties down to values of the degeneracy parameter of the order of 0.01. It also follows that the two most common definitions of photon bunching, the one based on the Fano factor and the one based on the correlation function, are not equivalent at low degeneracy levels.},

The beam splitter output currents showed negative cross-covariance, indicating that the electrons arrived individually at the beam splitter and were randomly partitioned into two output channels. As the relative time delay between the outputs was changed, the observed ringing in the cross-covariance was consistent with the bandwidths used to monitor the fluctuations.

	abstract = {A significant part of quantum theory can be obtained from a single innovation relative to classical theories, namely, that there is a fundamental restriction on the sorts of statistical distributions over physical states that can be prepared. This is termed an ``epistemic restriction'' because it implies a fundamental limit on the amount of knowledge that any observer can have about the physical state of a classical system. This article provides an overview of epistricted theories, that is, theories that start from a classical statistical theory and apply an epistemic restriction. We consider both continuous and discrete degrees of freedom, and show that a particular epistemic restriction called classical complementarity provides the beginning of a unification of all known epistricted theories. This restriction appeals to the symplectic structure of the underlying classical theory and consequently can be applied to an arbitrary classical degree of freedom. As such, it can be considered as a kind of quasi-quantization scheme; ``quasi'' because it generally only yields a theory describing a subset of the preparations, transformations and measurements allowed in the full quantum theory for that degree of freedom, and because in some cases, such as for binary variables, it yields a theory that is a distortion of such a subset. Finally, we propose to classify quantum phenomena as weakly or strongly nonclassical by whether or not they can arise in an epistricted theory.},

It can be used to obtain information on a system which is not available through conductance measurements. In particular, shot noise experiments can determine the charge and statistics of the quasiparticles relevant for transport, and reveal information on the potential profile and internal energy scales of mesoscopic systems. Shot noise is generally more sensitive to the effects of electron--electron interactions than the average conductance. We present a discussion based on the conceptually transparent scattering approach and on the classical Langevin and Boltzmann--Langevin methods; in addition a discussion of results which cannot be obtained by these methods is provided.

These transitions often occur under nonequilibrium conditions and are associated with hysteresis effects features usually taken to preclude the extraction of equilibrium information from the experimental data. But fluctuation theorems allow us to relate the work along nonequilibrium trajectories to thermodynamic free-energy differences. They have been shown to be applicable to single-molecule force measurements and have already provided information on the folding free energy of a RNA hairpin. Here we show that the Crooks fluctuation theorem can be used to determine folding free energies for folding and unfolding processes occurring in weak as well as strong nonequilibrium regimes, thereby providing a test of its validity under such conditions. We use optical tweezers to measure repeatedly the mechanical work associated with the unfolding and refolding of a small RNA hairpin and an RNA three-helix junction. The resultant work distributions are then analysed according to the theorem and allow us to determine the difference in folding free energy between an RNA molecule and a mutant differing only by one base pair, and the thermodynamic stabilizing effect of magnesium ions on the RNA structure. © 2005 Nature Publishing Group.},

It is merely another consequence of the 'clumping' of the photons. Note that if we had separated the branches by a polarizing filter, rather than a half-silvered mirror, the factor 1/2 would be lacking in (4), and (5) would have led to .:ln 1 .:ln 2 = 0, which is as it should be. If we were to split a beam of electrons by a non-polarizing mirror, allowing the beams to fall on separate electron multipliers, the outputs of the latter would show a negative cross-correlation. A split beam of classical particles would, of course, show zero cross-correlation. As usual in fluctuation phenomena, the behaviour of fermions and the behaviour of bosons deviate in opposite directions from that of classical particles. The Brown-Twiss effect is thus, froin a particle point of view, a characteristic quantum effect. It remains to show why Brannen and Ferguson did not find the effect. They looked for an increase in coincidence-rate over the 'normal' accidental rate, the latter being established by inserting a delay in one channel. Their single-channel rate was 5 x 10 4 counts per sec., their accidental coincidence rate about 20 per sec., and their resolving time about 10-• sec. To analyse their experiment one may conveniently take the duration T of an interval of observation to be equal to the resolving time. One then finds that the coincidence-rate should be enhanced, in consequence of the cross-correlation, by the factor (1 +-r 0 /2T). Unfortunately, Brannen and Ferg_uson do not specify their optical band-width ; but it seems unlikely, judging from their description of their source, that it was much less than 10n cycles/sec., which corresponds to a spread in wavelength of rather less than 1 A. at 4358 A. Adopting this figure for illustration, we have-r 0 = 10-11 sec., so that the expected fractional change in coincidence-rate is 0 ·0005. This is much less than the statistical uncertainty in the coincidence-rate in the Brannen and Ferguson experiment, which was about 0·01. Brown and Twiss did not count individual photo-electrons and coincidences, and were able to work with a primary photoelectric current some 10 4 times greater than that of Brannen and Ferguson. It ought to be possible to detect the correlation effect by the method of Brannen and Ferguson. Setting counting efficiency aside, the observing time required is proportional to the resolving time and inversely proportional to the square of the light flux per unit optical band-width. Without a substantial increase in the latter quantity, counting periods of the order of years would be needed to demonstrate the effect with the apparatus of Brannen and Ferguson. This only adds lustre to the notable achievement of Brown and Twiss.},

  abstract  = {A single-photon source is an enabling technology in device-independent quantum communication1, quantum simulation2,3, and linear optics-based4 and measurement-based quantum computing. These applications employ many photons and place stringent requirements on the efficiency of single-photon creation. The scaling on efficiency is typically an exponential function of the number of photons. Schemes taking full advantage of quantum superpositions also depend sensitively on the coherence of the photons, that is, their indistinguishability6. Here, we report a single-photon source with a high end-to-end efficiency. We employ gated quantum dots in an open, tunable microcavity7. The gating provides control of the charge and electrical tuning of the emission frequency; the high-quality material ensures low noise; and the tunability of the microcavity compensates for the lack of control in quantum dot position and emission frequency. Transmission through the top mirror is the dominant escape route for photons from the microcavity, and this output is well matched to a single-mode fibre. With this design, we can create a single photon at the output of the final optical fibre on-demand with a probability of up to 57 and with an average two-photon interference visibility of 97.5. Coherence persists in trains of thousands of photons with single-photon creation at a repetition rate of 1 GHz.},

   abstract = {The efficiency of an heat engine is traditionally defined as the ratio of its average output work over its average input heat. Its highest possible value was discovered by Carnot in 1824 and is a cornerstone concept in thermodynamics. It led to the discovery of the second law and to the definition of the Kelvin temperature scale. Small-scale engines operate in the presence of highly fluctuating input and output energy fluxes. They are therefore much better characterized by fluctuating efficiencies. In this study, using the fluctuation theorem, we identify universal features of efficiency fluctuations. While the standard thermodynamic efficiency is, as expected, the most likely value, we find that the Carnot efficiency is, surprisingly, the least likely in the long time limit. Furthermore, the probability distribution for the efficiency assumes a universal scaling form when operating close-to-equilibrium. We illustrate our results analytically and numerically on two model systems.},

abstract="The efficiency of cyclic heat engines is limited by the Carnot bound. This bound follows from the second law of thermodynamics and is attained by engines that operate between two thermal baths under the reversibility condition whereby the total entropy does not increase. By contrast, the efficiency of engines powered by quantum non-thermal baths has been claimed to surpass the thermodynamic Carnot bound. The key to understanding the performance of such engines is a proper division of the energy supplied by the bath to the system into heat and work, depending on the associated change in the system entropy and ergotropy. Due to their hybrid character, the efficiency bound for quantum engines powered by a non-thermal bath does not solely follow from the laws of thermodynamics. Hence, the thermodynamic Carnot bound is inapplicable to such hybrid engines. Yet, they do not violate the principles of thermodynamics. An alternative means of boosting machine performance is the concept of heat-to-work conversion catalysis by quantum non-linear (squeezed) pumping of the piston mode. This enhancement is due to the increased ability of the squeezed piston to store ergotropy. Since the catalyzed machine is fueled by thermal baths, it adheres to the Carnot bound. We conclude by arguing that it is not quantumness per se that improves the machine performance, but rather the properties of the baths, the working fluid and the piston that boost the ergotropy and minimize the wasted heat in both the input and the output.",

  abstract = {Continuing our investigation of the interaction between a beam of electrons and a crystal of nickel (Phys. Rev., 30, 705 (1927)) we are now directing the electron beam against a 1 1-face of the crystal at various angles of incidence, and are measuring the intensity of scattering in the incidence plane as a function of bombarding potential and direction. We find that under certain conditions a sharply defined beam of scattered electrons issues from the crystal in the direction of regular reflection. This occurs whenever the speed of the incident electrons is comprised within any of certain ranges which change in location as the angle of incidence is varied. Within each of these ranges there is an optimum speed at which the intensity of the reflected beam attains a maximum. That regular selective reflection of electrons from a crystal face would be observed under appropriate conditions was anticipated from our earlier observations on electron diffraction. The phenomenon is cdearly the analogue of the regular selective reflection of x-rays on which the Bragg method of x-ray spectroscopy is based, and is, of course, to be interpreted in terms of the undulatory theory of mechanics. The incident beam of electrons of speed v is equivalent to a beam of waves of wavelength h/mv; a portion of the incident beam is regularly reflected, through the process of coherent scattering, from each of the layers of atoms lying parallel to the crystal face, and the intensity of the resultant beam is a maximum when the elementary beams proceeding from the individual layers emerge from the crystal in phase. The condition for such a maximum in the case of x-ray reflection is that the wavelength and angle of the incident beam be related to the separation between successive atom layers of the crystal through the Bragg formula nX = 2d cos 0. The condition in the case of electron reflection is somewhat different. The wavelength)X(=h/mv) of the reflected beam at maximum intensity is not given by the Bragg formula. * These results, including the failure of the data to satisfy the Bragg formula, are in accord with those previously obtained in our experiments on electron diffraction. The reflection data fail to satisfy the Bragg relation for the same reason that the electron diffraction beams fail to coincide with their Laue beam analogues. These differences between the electron and x-ray phenomena can perhaps be accounted for by assuming , as first suggested by Eckart,' that the crystal is characterized by an index of refraction for electrons as it is for x-rays, and that for elec},

    "abstract": "The combined effect of fluid elasticity and yield-stress on the flow past a circular cylinder is studied by two-dimensional direct numerical simulation. We analyze the effects of yield-stress, elasticity, shear-thinning, and shear-thickening on the wake characteristics using the Saramito constitutive model. The elastoviscoplastic (EVP) wake flow is studied at a moderate Reynolds number (Re = 100) where two-dimensional vortex shedding occurs in the Newtonian case. We find that in the shear-thinning elastoviscoplastic flow, when yield stress increases, the drag coefficient and root mean square of the lift coefficient both decrease, while the length of the recirculation bubble $L_{RB}$ increases. These changes indicate that the wake oscillation amplitude decreases with an increasing yield stress. For shear-thickening however, the drag coefficient $C_D$ increases at a large Bingham number, and the wake becomes chaotic. The comparison of viscoelastic fluid and EVP fluid reveals that the polymer stresses, tr($τ^p$), decay considerably less downstream of the cylinder in the EVP case, indicating that significant stresses persist at large distances. We observe that shear-thinning competes with elastic and yield stresses and counteracts their effect, while shear-thickening enhances elastic and yield stress effects, so that the flow pattern can change from periodic to a chaotic flow.",

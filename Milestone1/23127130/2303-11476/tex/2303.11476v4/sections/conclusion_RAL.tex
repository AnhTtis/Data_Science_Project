In this work, we consider the MRMP problem under Gaussian uncertainty and introduce CC-K-CBS, which generates motion plans for each robot with chance-constraint guarantees.
% on the probability of collision with obstacles and other robots. 
This algorithm is based on extending K-CBS to accommodate belief space planning. 
% using belief-$\mathcal{A}$. 
Our main contribution includes three methods for fast evaluation of collision probabilities between robots. 
% We provide benchmarks comparing the computation time and conservatism of each proposed method, as well as benchmarks characterizing the performance of CC-K-CBS as a whole. 
This offline algorithm successfully generated motion plans across a variety of scenarios and scaled to 30 robots.
% in an empty environment, however 
Future directions could encompass other types of noise and nonlinear dynamics as well as new collision checking methods that could further 
improve computation time and conservatism.

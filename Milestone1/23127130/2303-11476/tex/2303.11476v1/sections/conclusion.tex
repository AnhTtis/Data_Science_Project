We consider the MRMP problem under Gaussian uncertainty. We propose an algorithm, CC-K-CBS, which generates motion plans for each robot while providing guarantees on satisfying chance constraints on the probability of collision with obstacles and other robots. This algorithm is based on extending K-CBS to accommodate belief space planning using belief-$\mathcal{A}$. Our main contribution is 3 different methods for checking for collisions between probabilistic robots. We provide benchmarks comparing the computation time and conservatism of each proposed method, as well as benchmarks characterizing the performance of CC-K-CBS as a whole. This first attempt at uncertain MRMP method successfully generated motion plans across a variety of scenarios and scaled to 25 robots in an empty environment, however further work could encompass other types of noise and nonlinear dynamics. Additionally, new collision methods could further improve computation time and conservatism.

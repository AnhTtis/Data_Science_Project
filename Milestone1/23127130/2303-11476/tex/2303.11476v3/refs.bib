abstract = {There has been a growing interest in AI in the design of multiagent systems, especially in multiagent cooperative planning. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which methods from single-agent planning and learning can be applied in multiagent settings. We survey a number of different techniques from decision-theoretic planning and reinforcement learning and describe a number of interesting issues that arise with regard to coordinating the policies of individual agents. To this end, we describe <i>multiagent Markov decision processes</i> as a general model in which to frame this discussion. These are special <i>n-</i>person cooperative games in which agents share the same utility function. We discuss coordination mechanisms based on imposed conventions (or social laws) as well as learning methods for coordination. Our focus is on the decomposition of sequential decision processes so that coordination can be learned (or imposed) locally, at the level of individual states. We also discuss the use of structured problem representations and their role in the generalization of learned conventions and in approximation.},

abstract = {In this paper we present feedback-based information roadmap (FIRM), a multi-query approach for planning under uncertainty which is a belief-space variant of probabilistic roadmap methods. The crucial feature of FIRM is that the costs associated with the edges are independent of each other, and in this sense it is the first method that generates a graph in belief space that preserves the optimal substructure property. From a practical point of view, FIRM is a robust and reliable planning framework. It is robust since the solution is a feedback and there is no need for expensive replanning. It is reliable because accurate collision probabilities can be computed along the edges. In addition, FIRM is a scalable framework, where the complexity of planning with FIRM is a constant multiplier of the complexity of planning with PRM. In this paper, FIRM is introduced as an abstract framework. As a concrete instantiation of FIRM, we adopt stationary linear quadratic Gaussian (SLQG) controllers as belief stabilizers and introduce the so-called SLQG-FIRM. In SLQG-FIRM we focus on kinematic systems and then extend to dynamical systems by sampling in the equilibrium space. We investigate the performance of SLQG-FIRM in different scenarios.},

It is shown that dynamic feedback linearization can be used to design a simple control law which is valid for trajectory tracking as well as point stabilization tasks. In particular, for both cases exponential convergence with linear transients in the cartesian space is obtained. Experimental results for a laboratory prototype prove the effectiveness of the proposed method.}

abstract="Robust trajectory execution is an extension of cooperative collision avoidance that takes pre-planned trajectories directly into account. We propose an algorithm for robust trajectory execution that compensates for a variety of dynamic changes, including newly appearing obstacles, robots breaking down, imperfect motion execution, and external disturbances. Robots do not communicate with each other and only sense other robots' positions and the obstacles around them. At the high-level we use a hybrid planning strategy employing both discrete planning and trajectory optimization with a dynamic receding horizon approach. The discrete planner helps to avoid local minima, adjusts the planning horizon, and provides good initial guesses for the optimization stage. Trajectory optimization uses a quadratic programming formulation, where all safety-critical parts are formulated as hard constraints. At the low-level, we use buffered Voronoi cells as a multi-robot collision avoidance strategy. Compared to ORCA, our approach supports higher-order dynamic limits and avoids deadlocks better. We demonstrate our approach in simulation and on physical robots, showing that it can operate in real time.",

    abstract = { Sampling-based algorithms are viewed as practical solutions for high-dimensional motion planning. Recent progress has taken advantage of random geometric graph theory to show how asymptotic optimality can also be achieved with these methods. Achieving this desirable property for systems with dynamics requires solving a two-point boundary value problem (BVP) in the state space of the underlying dynamical system. It is difficult, however, if not impractical, to generate a BVP solver for a variety of important dynamical models of robots or physically simulated ones. Thus, an open challenge was whether it was even possible to achieve optimality guarantees when planning for systems without access to a BVP solver. This work resolves the above question and describes how to achieve asymptotic optimality for kinodynamic planning using incremental sampling-based planners by introducing a new rigorous framework. Two new methods, STABLE\_SPARSE\_RRT (SST) and SST*, result from this analysis, which are asymptotically near-optimal and optimal, respectively. The techniques are shown to converge fast to high-quality paths, while they maintain only a sparse set of samples, which makes them computationally efficient. The good performance of the planners is confirmed by experimental results using dynamical systems benchmarks, as well as physically simulated robots. }

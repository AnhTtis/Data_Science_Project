We consider a chance-constrained multi-robot motion planning problem in the presence of Gaussian motion and sensor noise. Our proposed algorithm, CC-K-CBS, leverages the scalability of kinodynamic conflict-based search (K-CBS) in conjunction with the efficiency of the Gaussian belief trees used in the Belief-$\mathcal{A}$ framework, and inherits the completeness guarantees of Belief-$\mathcal{A}$'s low-level sampling-based planner. We also develop three different methods for robot-robot probabilistic collision checking, which trade off computation with accuracy. Our algorithm generates motion plans driving each robot from its initial state to its goal while accounting for the evolution of its uncertainty with chance-constrained safety guarantees. Benchmarks compare computation time to conservatism of the collision checkers, in addition to characterizing the performance of the planner as a whole.  Results show that  CC-K-CBS can scale up to 30 robots.

    "abstract": "We say that a graph $G$ is $(2,m)$-linked if, for any distinct vertices $a_1,\\ldots, a_m, b_1,b_2$ in $G$, there exist vertex disjoint connected subgraphs $A,B$ of $G$ such that $\\{a_1, \\ldots, a_m\\}$ is contained in $A$ and $\\{b_1,b_2\\}$ is contained in $B$. A fundamental result in structural graph theory is the characterization of $(2,2)$-linked graphs, with different versions obtained independently by Robertson and Chakravarty, Seymour, and Thomassen. It appears to be very difficult to characterize $(2,m)$-linked graphs for $m\\ge 3$. In this paper, we provide a partial characterization of $(2,m)$-linked graphs by adding an average degree condition. This implies that $(2m+2)$-connected graphs are $(2,m)$-linked. Moreover, if $G$ is a $(2m+2)$-connected graph and $a_1, \\ldots, a_m, b_1,b_2$ are distinct vertices of $G$, then there is a path $P$ in $G$ between $b_1$ and $b_2$ and avoiding $\\{a_1, \\ldots, a_m\\}$ such that $G-P$ is connected, improving a previous connectivity bound of $10m$.",

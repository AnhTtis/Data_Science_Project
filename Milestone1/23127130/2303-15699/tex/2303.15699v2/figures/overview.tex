A shared backbone network extracts features from mammogram images, which are then used in a transformer decoder module to incorporate information from prior mammograms. The transformer decoder has $L$ layers. The resulting features are concatenated with the current feature and used to predict the cumulative hazard function $\hat{H}$ for breast cancer.

A common backbone network extracts features from the prior and current images, resulting in $x_{prior}$ and $x_{curr}$. We find that the transformer decoder effectively fuses relevant information from $x_{prior}$ and $x_{curr}$ to produce $x_{CPC}$.
%These features are used in the transformer decoder to model the relationship between the current and past images, producing $x_{CPC}$, which is concatenated with $x_{curr}$. 
The base hazard $\theta_{b}$ and time-dependent hazard prediction heads $\theta_{u}$ use the concatenated feature to predict the cumulative hazard function $\hat{H}$. (a) illustrates the interaction between $x_{prior}$ and $x_{curr}$ in the cross-attention module of the transformer decoder.}

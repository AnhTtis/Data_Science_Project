In this paper, we introduce a novel breast cancer risk prediction method, \ours, which incorporates prior mammograms with a transformer decoder to capture changes in breast tissue over time. By doing so, we achieve high performance for both short-term and long-term risk prediction. Our extensive experiments on a dataset of 16,113 exams show that \ours outperformed a model based on the state-of-the art for breast cancer risk prediction \cite{yala2021toward}. The method performed particularly well in cases where there was a change in breast density from the previous exam. We believe that our method has the potential to improve breast cancer risk prediction models and ultimately contribute to earlier detection of the disease.

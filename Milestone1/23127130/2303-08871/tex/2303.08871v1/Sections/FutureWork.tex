This paper proposed a machine learning (ML) solution implemented via federated learning (FL) to modify the B.A.T.M.A.N. routing protocol for unmanned aerial vehicle networks. We presented a FL testbed built on the network emulator EMANE and used the CIFAR10 dataset to compare the FL testbed to a traditional centralized ML approach. The baseline results proved the testbed works as a proof of concept for future work. We also propose modifying the B.A.T.M.A.N. algorithm using a long short term memory model. However, current results do not accurately reflect the viability of this modification. Therefore, future work will need to generate a dataset from a simulation of the UAV swarm using EMANE to assess this approach better.

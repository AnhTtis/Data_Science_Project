    "abstract": "We consider the indirect detection of dark matter within an extension of the standard model (SM) including a singlet fermion as cold dark matter (CDM) and a singlet pseudo-scalar as a mediator between dark matter and the SM particles. The annihilation cross section of the CDM into two monochromatic photons is calculated and compared with the latest H.E.S.S. data. Although for dark matter masses below 1 TeV the predicted observable cross sections are far from the sensitivity of the recent gamma-ray experiments,\n  it can be comparable to the strongest H.E.S.S. upper bounds for some models with more massive CDM.",

    "abstract": "We examine the possible existence of Dirac semimetal with magnetic order in two-dimensional system with a nonsymmorphic symmetry by using mean-field theory within the Hubbard model. We locate the region in the spin-orbit coupling vs Hubbard interaction phase diagram, where such a state is stabilized. The edge states for ribbons extending along both the $x$ and $y$ directions are obtained. Then, we comment on the feasibility of such a state when the $SU(2)$ symmetric nature of the Hubbard interaction is considered. Finally, the effects of magnetic field on the Dirac semimetallic states and corresponding edge states are also explored.",

    "abstract": "Weak degeneracy is a variation of degeneracy which shares many nice\nproperties of degeneracy. In particular, if a graph $G$ is weakly\n$d$-degenerate, then for any $(d + 1)$-list assignment $L$ of $G$, one can\nconstruct an $L$-coloring of $G$ by a modified greedy coloring algorithm. It is\nknown that planar graphs of girth 5 are 3-choosable and locally planar graphs\nare 5-choosable. This paper strengthens these results and proves that planar\ngraphs of girth 5 are weakly 2-degenerate and locally planar graphs are weakly\n4-degenerate.",

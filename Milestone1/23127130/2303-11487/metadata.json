    "abstract": "Given a topological dynamical system $(X,T)$, we study properties of the mean orbital pseudo-metric $\\bar E$ defined by \\[ \\bar E(x,y)= \\limsup_{n\\to\\infty } \\min_{σ\\in S_n}\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}d(T^k(x),T^{σ(k)}(y)), \\] where $x,y\\in X$ and $S_n$ is the permutation group of $\\{0,1,\\ldots,n-1\\}$. Let $\\hatω_T(x)$ denote the set of measures quasi-generated by a point $x\\in X$. We show that the map $x\\mapsto\\hatω_T(x)$ is uniformly continuous if $X$ is endowed with the pseudo-metric $\\bar E$ and the space of compact subsets of the set of invariant measures is considered with the Hausdorff distance. We also obtain a new characterisation of $\\bar E$-continuity, which connects it to other properties studied in the literature, like continuous pointwise ergodicity introduced by Downarowicz and Weiss. Finally, we apply our results to reprove some known results on $\\bar E$-continuous and mean equicontinuous systems.",

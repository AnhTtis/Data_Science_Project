    "abstract": "We consider electrically neutral complex vector particles $V$ below the GeV mass scale that, from a low energy perspective, couple to the photon via higher dimensional form factor interactions. We derive ensuing astrophysical constraints by considering the anomalous energy loss from the Sun, Horizontal Branch, and Red Giant stars as well as from SN1987A that arise from vector pair-production in these environments. Under the assumption that the dark states $V$ constitute dark matter, the bounds are then complemented by direct and indirect detection as well as cosmological limits. The relic density from freeze-out and freeze-in mechanisms is also computed. On the basis of a UV-complete model that realizes the considered effective couplings, we also discuss the naturalness of the constrained parameter space, and provide an analysis of the zero mass limit of $V$.",

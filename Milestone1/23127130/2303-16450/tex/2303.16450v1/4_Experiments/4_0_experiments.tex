\label{sec:4}
In this section, we demonstrate the effectiveness of SPoTr and provide quantitative and qualitative results for further analyses.
% We evaluate our architectures for object classification (\Cref{sec:4.1}), shape part segmentation and scene segmentation (\Cref{sec:4.2}).
First, we conduct shape classification and semantic segmentation~(\Cref{sec:4.1}).
We also provide ablation studies and complexity analysis of SPoTr~(\Cref{sec:4.2}).
Lastly, we provide visualizations to better understand how SPA behaves~(\Cref{sec:4.3}). Implementation details are available in the supplement.
% We also perform the ablation studies to better understand the contribution of each component~(\Cref{sec:4.3}), followed by qualitatively and quantitatively analyses of SPoTr~(\Cref{sec:4.3}) with the visualization.

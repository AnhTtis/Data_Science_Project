\caption{{{\textbf{Illustration of self-positioning point-based attention (SPA).} Given input points $\Cen$ and their corresponding features $\Feat$, self-positioning points~(SP points) $\Vpoint$ are adaptively placed through the learnable latent $\Zfeat$. SP points aggregate features considering both spatial and semantic proximity and constructs $\Vfeat$ via disentangled attention. Then, SPA performs channel-wise point attention (CWPA) between input points and SP points to generate the output features $\Feat^{\text{SPA}}$.

\textbf{Overall Architecture of SPoTr.} For classification~(bottom), four SPoTr blocks run consecutively, followed by a max-pooling and a multi-layer perceptron. 
For segmentation~(top), a U-net style architecture is adopted with SPoTr blocks for downsampling and feature propagation for upsampling, followed by a multi-layer perceptron.}

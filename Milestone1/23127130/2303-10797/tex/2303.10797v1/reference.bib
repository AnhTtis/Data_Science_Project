  abstract = 	 {Message passing neural networks have become a method of choice for learning on graphs, in particular the prediction of chemical properties and the acceleration of molecular dynamics studies. While they readily scale to large training data sets, previous approaches have proven to be less data efficient than kernel methods. We identify limitations of invariant representations as a major reason and extend the message passing formulation to rotationally equivariant representations. On this basis, we propose the polarizable atom interaction neural network (PaiNN) and improve on common molecule benchmarks over previous networks, while reducing model size and inference time. We leverage the equivariant atomwise representations obtained by PaiNN for the prediction of tensorial properties. Finally, we apply this to the simulation of molecular spectra, achieving speedups of 4-5 orders of magnitude compared to the electronic structure reference.}

abstractNote = {Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction to fuels presents one of the great challenges in chemistry. Herein we present an understanding of trends in electrocatalytic activity for carbon dioxide reduction over different metal catalysts that rationalize a number of experimental observations including the selectivity with respect to the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. We also identify two design criteria for more active catalysts. The understanding is based on density functional theory calculations of activation energies for electrochemical carbon monoxide reduction as a basis for an electrochemical kinetic model of the process. Furthermore, we develop scaling relations relating transition state energies to the carbon monoxide adsorption energy and determine the optimal value of this descriptor to be very close to that of copper.},

abstract={Surface reaction networks involving hydrocarbons exhibit enormous complexity with thousands of species and reactions for all but the very simplest of chemistries. We present a framework for optimization under uncertainty for heterogeneous catalysis reaction networks using surrogate models that are trained on the fly. The surrogate model is constructed by teaching a Gaussian process adsorption energies based on group additivity fingerprints, combined with transition-state scaling relations and a simple classifier for determining the rate-limiting step. The surrogate model is iteratively used to predict the most important reaction step to be calculated explicitly with computationally demanding electronic structure theory. Applying these methods to the reaction of syngas on rhodium(111), we identify the most likely reaction mechanism. Propagating uncertainty throughout this process yields the likelihood that the final mechanism is complete given measurements on only a subset of the entire network and uncertainty in the underlying density functional theory calculations.},

abstract = {We present the Python Materials Genomics (pymatgen) library, a robust, open-source Python library for materials analysis. A key enabler in high-throughput computational materials science efforts is a robust set of software tools to perform initial setup for the calculations (e.g., generation of structures and necessary input files) and post-calculation analysis to derive useful material properties from raw calculated data. The pymatgen library aims to meet these needs by (1) defining core Python objects for materials data representation, (2) providing a well-tested set of structure and thermodynamic analyses relevant to many applications, and (3) establishing an open platform for researchers to collaboratively develop sophisticated analyses of materials data obtained both from first principles calculations and experiments. The pymatgen library also provides convenient tools to obtain useful materials data via the Materials Project’s REpresentational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API). As an example, using pymatgen’s interface to the Materials Project’s RESTful API and phasediagram package, we demonstrate how the phase and electrochemical stability of a recently synthesized material, Li4SnS4, can be analyzed using a minimum of computing resources. We find that Li4SnS4 is a stable phase in the Li–Sn–S phase diagram (consistent with the fact that it can be synthesized), but the narrow range of lithium chemical potentials for which it is predicted to be stable would suggest that it is not intrinsically stable against typical electrodes used in lithium-ion batteries.}

abstract = {Data science and informatics tools have been proliferating recently within the computational materials science and catalysis fields. This proliferation has spurned the creation of various frameworks for automated materials screening, discovery, and design. Underpinning these frameworks are surrogate models with uncertainty estimates on their predictions. These uncertainty estimates are instrumental for determining which materials to screen next, but the computational catalysis field does not yet have a standard procedure for judging the quality of such uncertainty estimates. Here we present a suite of figures and performance metrics derived from the machine learning community that can be used to judge the quality of such uncertainty estimates. This suite probes the accuracy, calibration, and sharpness of a model quantitatively. We then show a case study where we judge various methods for predicting density-functional-theory-calculated adsorption energies. Of the methods studied here, we find that the best performer is a model where a convolutional neural network is used to supply features to a Gaussian process regressor, which then makes predictions of adsorption energies along with corresponding uncertainty estimates.}

 abstract = {Consider two data matrices on the same sample of n individuals, X(p × n), Y(q × n). From these matrices, geometrical representations of the sample are obtained as two configurations of n points, in Rp and Rq. It is shown that the RV-coefficient (Escoufier, 1970, 1973) can be used as a measure of similarity of the two configurations, taking into account the possibly distinct metrics to be used on them to measure the distances between points. The purpose of this paper is to show that most classical methods of linear multivariate statistical analysis can be interpreted as the search for optimal linear transformations or, equivalently, the search for optimal metrics to apply on two data matrices on the same sample; the optimality is defined in terms of the similarity of the corresponing configurations of points. which, in turn, calls for the maximization of the associated RV-coefficient. The methods studied are principal components, principal components of instrumental variables, multivariate regression, canonical variables, discriminant analysis; they are differentiated by the possible relationships existing between the two data matrices involved and by additional constraints under which the maximum of RV is to be obtained. It is also shown that the RV-coefficient can be used as a measure of goodness of a solution to the problem of discarding variables.},

ABSTRACT={The Sabatier principle, which states that the binding energy between the catalyst and the reactant should be neither too strong nor too weak, has been widely used as the key criterion in designing and screening electrocatalytic materials necessary to promote the sustainability of our society. The widespread success of density functional theory (DFT) has made binding energy calculations a routine practice, turning the Sabatier principle from an empirical principle into a quantitative predictive tool. Given its importance in electrocatalysis, we have attempted to introduce the reader to the fundamental concepts of the Sabatier principle with a highlight on the limitations and challenges in its current thermodynamic context. The Sabatier principle is situated at the heart of catalyst development, and moving beyond its current thermodynamic framework is expected to promote the identification of next-generation electrocatalysts.}

Advances in density functional theory mean it is now possible to describe catalytic reactions at surfaces with the detail and accuracy required for computational results to compare favourably with experiments. Theoretical methods can be used to describe surface chemical reactions in detail and to understand variations in catalytic activity from one catalyst to another. Here, we review the first steps towards using computational methods to design new catalysts. Examples include screening for catalysts with increased activity and catalysts with improved selectivity. We discuss how, in the future, such methods may be used to engineer the electronic structure of the active surface by changing its composition and structure.},

abstract  ="With the popularity of machine learning growing in the field of catalysis there are increasing numbers of catalyst databases becoming available. These databases provide us with the opportunity to search for catalysts with desired properties{,} which could lead to the discovery of new catalysts. However{,} while there are search methods for molecules based on similarity metrics{,} for solid-state catalyst systems there is not yet a straightforward search method. In this work{,} we propose a neural network embeddings based similarity search method that is applicable for both molecules and solid-state catalyst systems. We illustrate how the search method works and show search examples for the QM9{,} Materials Project (MP) and Open Catalyst 2020 (OC20) databases. We show that the configurations found present similarity in terms of geometry{,} composition{,} energy and in the electronic density of states. These results imply the neural network embeddings have encoded effective information that could be used to retrieve molecules and materials with similar properties."}

abstract = {A graph neural network transforms features in each vertex's neighborhood into a vector representation of the vertex. Afterward, each vertex's representation is used independently for predicting its label. This standard pipeline implicitly assumes that vertex labels are conditionally independent given their neighborhood features. However, this is a strong assumption, and we show that it is far from true on many real-world graph datasets. Focusing on regression tasks, we find that this conditional independence assumption severely limits predictive power. This should not be that surprising, given that traditional graph-based semi-supervised learning methods such as label propagation work in the opposite fashion by explicitly modeling the correlation in predicted outcomes.Here, we address this problem with an interpretable and efficient framework that can improve any graph neural network architecture simply by exploiting correlation structure in the regression residuals. In particular, we model the joint distribution of residuals on vertices with a parameterized multivariate Gaussian, and estimate the parameters by maximizing the marginal likelihood of the observed labels. Our framework achieves substantially higher accuracy than competing baselines, and the learned parameters can be interpreted as the strength of correlation among connected vertices. Furthermore, we develop linear time algorithms for low-variance, unbiased model parameter estimates, allowing us to scale to large networks. We also provide a basic version of our method that makes stronger assumptions on correlation structure but is painless to implement, often leading to great practical performance with minimal overhead.},

abstract  ="The adsorption energy and electronic properties of sulfur dioxide (SO2) adsorbed on different low-Miller index cobalt phosphide (CoP) surfaces were examined using density functional theory (DFT). Different surface atomic terminations and initial molecular orientations were systematically investigated in detail to determine the most active and stable surface for use as a hydrotreating catalyst. It was found that the surface catalytic reactivity of CoP and its performance were highly sensitive to the crystal plane{,} where the surface orientation/termination had a remarkable impact on the interfacial chemical bonding and electronic states toward the adsorption of the SO2 molecule. Specifically{,} analysis of the surface energy adsorption revealed that SO2 on Co-terminated surfaces{,} especially in (010){,} (101) and (110) facets{,} is energetically more favorable compared to other low index surfaces. Charge density difference{,} density of states (DOS) and Gibbs free energy studies were also carried out to further understand the bonding mechanism and the electronic interactions with the adsorbate. It is anticipated that the current findings will support experimental research towards the design of catalysts for SO2 hydrodesulfurization based on cobalt phosphide nanoparticles."}

abstract  ="First principles calculations were performed to cast insight into the mechanism of the improvement of O2 reduction reaction (ORR) activity by Zn and H interstitials on the anatase TiO2 (101) surface. For the Zn-modified anatase TiO2 (101) surface{,} both surface and subsurface Zn interstitials could contribute to O2 adsorption and dissociation{,} but the dissociation barriers of O2 molecules are still too high{,} which limits the ORR activity. After a H adatom is introduced onto the Zn-modified anatase TiO2 (101) surface{,} the highest energy barriers are greatly reduced compared with those of the Zn-modified surface. Meanwhile{,} it is observed that the dissociation barriers decrease almost linearly with the increase of the charge difference of adsorption O2 between initial and transition state configurations. Specifically{,} subsurface Zn and surface H interstitials facilitate O2 dissociation and subsequent oxidation reactions{,} and further frequency analysis shows that these dissociation processes are frequent even at the room temperature of 300 K. In a word{,} this work provides a theoretical support to design a high ORR activity catalyst of the TiO2 nanocrystal comparable to precious Pt catalysts."}

month={Jun},

volume={6},
number={1},
pages={79},
abstract={Heterogeneous catalysts constitute a crucial component of many industrial processes, and to gain an understanding of the atomic-scale features of such catalysts, ab initio density functional theory is widely employed. Recently, growing computational power has permitted the extension of such studies to complex reaction networks involving either high adsorbate coverages or multidentate adsorbates, which bind to the surface through multiple atoms. Describing all possible adsorbate configurations for such systems, however, is often not possible based on chemical intuition alone. To systematically treat such complexities, we present a generalized Python-based graph theory approach to convert atomic scale models into undirected graph representations. These representations, when combined with workflows such as evolutionary algorithms, can systematically generate high coverage adsorbate models and classify unique minimum energy multidentate adsorbate configurations for surfaces of low symmetry, including multi-elemental alloy surfaces, steps, and kinks. Two case studies are presented which demonstrate these capabilities; first, an analysis of a coverage-dependent phase diagram of absorbate NO on the Pt3Sn(111) terrace surface, and second, an investigation of adsorption energies, together with identifying unique minimum energy configurations, for the reaction intermediate propyne (CHCCH3*) adsorbed on a PdIn(021) step surface. The evolutionary algorithm approach reproduces high coverage configurations of NO on Pt3Sn(111) using only 15{\%} of the number of simulations required for a brute force approach. Furthermore, the screening of potentially hundreds of multidentate adsorbates is shown to be possible without human intervention. The strategy presented is quite general and can be applied to a spectrum of complex atomic systems.},

journal={npj Computational Materials},

month={Jan},
day={04},
volume={5},
number={1},
pages={4},
abstract={The performance of density functional theory approximations for predicting materials thermodynamics is typically assessed by comparing calculated and experimentally determined enthalpies of formation from elemental phases, $\Delta$Hf. However, a compound competes thermodynamically with both other compounds and their constituent elemental forms, and thus, the enthalpies of the decomposition reactions to these competing phases, $\Delta$Hd, determine thermodynamic stability. We evaluated the phase diagrams for 56,791 compounds to classify decomposition reactions into three types: 1. those that produce elemental phases, 2. those that produce compounds, and 3. those that produce both. This analysis shows that the decomposition into elemental forms is rarely the competing reaction that determines compound stability and that approximately two-thirds of decomposition reactions involve no elemental phases. Using experimentally reported formation enthalpies for 1012 solid compounds, we assess the accuracy of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) (PBE) and meta-GGA (SCAN) density functionals for predicting compound stability. For 646 decomposition reactions that are not trivially the formation reaction, PBE (mean absolute difference between theory and experiment (MAD){\thinspace}={\thinspace}70{\thinspace}meV/atom) and SCAN (MAD{\thinspace}={\thinspace}59{\thinspace}meV/atom) perform similarly, and commonly employed correction schemes using fitted elemental reference energies make only a negligible improvement ({\textasciitilde}2 meV/atom). Furthermore, for 231 reactions involving only compounds (Type 2), the agreement between SCAN, PBE, and experiment is within {\textasciitilde}35{\thinspace}meV/atom and is thus comparable to the magnitude of experimental uncertainty.},

abstract={Adsorption is essential for many processes on surfaces; therefore, an accurate prediction of adsorption properties is demanded from both fundamental and technological points of view. Particularly, identifying the intrinsic determinants of adsorption energy has been a long-term goal in surface science. Herein, we propose a predictive model for quantitative determination of the adsorption energies of small molecules on metallic materials and oxides, by using a linear combination of the valence and electronegativity of surface atoms and the coordination of active sites, with the corresponding prefactors determined by the valence of adsorbates. This model quantifies the effect of the intrinsic properties of adsorbates and substrates on adsorbate--substrate bonding, derives naturally the well-known adsorption-energy scaling relations, and accounts for the efficiency and limitation of engineering the adsorption energy and reaction energy. All involved parameters are predictable and thus allow the rapid rational design of materials with optimal adsorption properties.},

ABSTRACT={Metal-N-doped carbon is a promising replacement for non-precious-metal catalysts such as Pt for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Although these materials have relatively good catalytic activity and are cost-effective, they still have lower ORR activity than Pt, and so improving their performances is greatly required. In this study, high-throughput screening was employed based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations to search for good candidate catalysts with a transition metal atom coordinated by heteroatoms (B, N, S, O, and P) embedded in a graphene structure. In addition, coordinating a transition metal with two types of heteroatom dopants in a graphene structure was also considered. We calculated the binding energies of ORR intermediates on metal-heteroatom-based graphene structures because they are known to play a key role in ORR. Based on our results, the new group of electrocatalysts imparts excellent ORR activity for PEMFCs, and we suggest that our approach provides useful insight into exploring other promising candidate catalysts.}

    "abstract": "Let $A$ be a subset of the cyclic group $\\mathbf{Z}/p\\mathbf{Z}$ with $p$ prime. It is a well-studied problem to determine how small $|A|$ can be if there is no unique sum in $A+A$, meaning that for every two elements $a_1,a_2\\in A$, there exist $a_1',a_2'\\in A$ such that $a_1+a_2=a_1'+a_2'$ and $\\{a_1,a_2\\}\\neq \\{a_1',a_2'\\}$. Let $m(p)$ be the size of a smallest subset of $\\mathbf{Z}/p\\mathbf{Z}$ with no unique sum. The previous best known bounds are $\\log p \\ll m(p)\\ll \\sqrt{p}$. In this paper we improve both the upper and lower bounds to $ω(p)\\log p \\leqslant m(p)\\ll (\\log p)^2$ for some function $ω(p)$ which tends to infinity as $p\\to \\infty$. In particular, this shows that for any $B\\subset \\mathbf{Z}/p\\mathbf{Z}$ of size $|B|<ω(p)\\log p$, its sumset $B+B$ contains a unique sum. We also obtain corresponding bounds on the size of the smallest subset of a general Abelian group having no unique sum.",

    "abstract": "Honeycomb structures lead to conically degenerate points on the dispersion surfaces. These spectral points, termed as Dirac points, are responsible for various topological phenomena. In this paper, we investigate the generalized honeycomb-structured materials, which have six inclusions in a hexagonal cell. We obtain the asymptotic band structures and corresponding eigenstates in the subwavelength regime using the layer potential theory. Specifically, we rigorously prove the existence of the double Dirac cones lying on the 2nd-5th bands when the six inclusions satisfy an additional symmetry. This type of inclusions will be referred to as super honeycomb-structured inclusions. Two distinct deformations breaking the additional symmetry, contraction and dilation, are further discussed. We prove that the double Dirac cone disappears, and a local spectral gap opens. The corresponding eigenstates are also obtained to show the topological differences between these two deformations. Direct numerical simulations using finite element methods agree well with our analysis.",

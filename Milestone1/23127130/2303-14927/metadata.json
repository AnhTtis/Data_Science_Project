    "abstract": "In a phenomenological approach, the $α$ + core structure is investigated in the $^{20}$Ne, $^{44}$Ti, $^{94}$Mo, $^{104}$Te, and $^{212}$Po nuclei through the local potential model using a double-folding nuclear potential with effective nucleon-nucleon interaction of M3Y + $c_{\\mathrm{sat}}δ(s)$ type, where the term $c_{\\mathrm{sat}}δ(s)$ acts only between the saturation regions of $α$-cluster and core. Properties such as energy levels, $α$-widths, $B(E2)$ transition rates, and half-lives are calculated, and good level of agreement with experimental data is obtained in general. It is shown the inclusion of the term $c_{\\mathrm{sat}}δ(s)$ is determinant for a better description of the experimental energy levels compared to the ground state bands produced with the simple M3Y interaction. The properties calculated for $^{104}$Te reinforce the superallowed $α$-decay feature for this nucleus, as indicated in previous studies.",

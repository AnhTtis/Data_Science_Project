    "abstract": "We present a provenance model for the generic workflow of numerical Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) calculations, which constitute an important component of particle physics research. These calculations are carried out on the largest supercomputers worldwide with data in the multi-PetaByte range being generated and analyzed. In the Lattice QCD community, a custom metadata standard (QCDml) that includes certain provenance information already exists for one part of the workflow, the so-called generation of configurations.\n  In this paper, we follow the W3C PROV standard and formulate a provenance model that includes both the generation part and the so-called measurement part of the Lattice QCD workflow. We demonstrate the applicability of this model and show how the model can be used to answer some provenance-related research questions. However, many important provenance questions in the Lattice QCD community require extensions of this provenance model. To this end, we propose a multi-layered provenance approach that combines prospective and retrospective elements.",

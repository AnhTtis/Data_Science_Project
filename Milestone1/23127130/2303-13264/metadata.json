    "abstract": "We consider high-dimensional MIMO transmissions in frequency division duplexing (FDD) systems. For precoding, the frequency selective channel has to be measured, quantized and fed back to the base station by the users. When the number of antennas is very high this typically leads to prohibitively high quantization complexity and large feedback. In 5G New Radio (NR), a modular quantization approach has been applied for this, where first a low-dimensional subspace is identified for the whole frequency selective channel, and then subband channels are linearly mapped to this subspace and quantized. We analyze how the components in such a modular scheme contribute to the overall quantization distortion. Based on this analysis we improve the technology components in the modular approach and propose an orthonormalized wideband precoding scheme and a sequential wideband precoding approach which provide considerable gains over the conventional method. We compare the performance of the developed quantization schemes to prior art by simulations in terms of the projection distortion, overall distortion and spectral efficiency, in a scenario with a realistic spatial channel model.",

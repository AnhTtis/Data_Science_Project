% in the interest of simulating practically relevant high-speed flow problems such as supersonic jet noise

\begin{abstract}
% Accurate simulation of high-speed flows of practical interest require numerical methods with high-resolution properties. In this paper, we primarily focus on extending and demonstrating the use of the new high-accuracy \say{Gradient-based reconstruction} and \say{$\alpha$-damping} schemes introduced by Chamarthi (2022) \cite{chamx} to generalized curvilinear and dynamic mesh domains with freestream preservation property. The paper is organized into three parts. The first part focuses on the implementation details of Gradient-based reconstruction and $\alpha$-damping schemes. Various steps involved in achieving freestream and vortex preservation properties are addressed through demonstrative test cases. The second part presents the algorithm's efficacy in simulating supersonic jet screech. It was noted that both the implicit and explicit versions of the algorithm are able to resolve the screech tones and characterize the unsteady lateral flapping mode of a Mach $1.35$ under-expanded supersonic jet with good fidelity. On the other hand WENO-Z scheme was noted to fail in resolve the same at the same grid resolution. The third part discusses the GPU parallelization model employed and the corresponding performance statistics achieved on the latest generations of data center GPU hardware. With more than two hundred times speedup compared to a single-core CPU, a turnaround time of 34.5 hrs per simulation was achieved with GPU acceleration for the supersonic jet noise simulation case ran at 13 million grid cell count. 

Accurate high-speed flow simulations of practical interest require numerical methods with high-resolution properties. In this paper, we present an extension and demonstration of the high-accuracy Gradient-based reconstruction and $\alpha$-damping schemes introduced by Chamarthi (2022) \cite{chamx} for simulating high-speed flows in generalized curvilinear and dynamic mesh domains with the freestream preservation property. In the first part of this paper, the algorithms are detailed within the generalized curvilinear coordinate framework, with a focus on demonstration through stationary and dynamic mesh test cases. It has been shown both theoretically and through the use of test cases that the conservative metrics, including their interpolation to cell interfaces, must be numerically computed using a central scheme that is consistent with the inviscid flux algorithm to achieve the freestream preservation property. The second part of the paper illustrates the efficacy of the algorithm in simulating supersonic jet screech by displaying its capability to capture the screech tones and accurately characterize the unsteady lateral flapping mode of a Mach 1.35 under-expanded supersonic jet, in contrast to the WENO-Z scheme which fails to do so at the same grid resolution. In the final part of the paper, the parallelizability of the schemes on GPU architectures is demonstrated and performance metrics are evaluated. A significant speedup of over $200 \times$ (compared to a single core CPU) and a reduction in simulation completion time to 34.5 hours per simulation were achieved for the supersonic jet noise case at a grid resolution of 13 million cells.


% The jet oscillation behaviour and azimuthal variation of screech amplitude is also investigated.
% The key features of the methodology include high-resolution fourth-order inviscid and viscous flux discretization, freestream preservation, dynamic mesh motion, and GPU acceleration.

%% Notes
% Schemes - MP5, MEG, and MIG.
% A short assessment on the effect of grid quality is also performed, which revealed that the implicit algorithms are least affected by the grid skewness and grid distortion compared to the employment of explicit schemes.

% Best practices to predict supersonic jet screech - grid requirements, scheme requirements, 
% Include best practices for GPU acceleration

    "abstract": "In this article an $n$-pursuer versus $m$-evader reach-avoid differential\ngame in 3D space is studied. A team of evaders aim to reach a stationary target\nwhile avoiding capture by a team of pursuers. The multiplayer scenario is\nformulated in a differential game framework. This article provides an optimal\nsolution for the particular case of $n=m=1$ and extends it to a more general\nscenario of $n\\geq m$ via an optimal role assignment algorithm based on a\nlinear program. Consequently, the barrier surface and the Value of the game are\nanalytically characterized providing optimal strategies of the players in state\nfeedback form.",

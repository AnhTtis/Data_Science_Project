    "abstract": "Let $G$ be a graph of order $n$ and $N = \\{N(u_{i})\\}^k_{i=1}$ be a sequence of neighbourhood(nbh)s in $G$ where $N(u)$ = $\\{v\\in V(G):$ $uv\\in E(G)\\}$. \\emph{Nbh sequence graph $H$ of} $N$ in $G$ is defined as the union of all induced subgraphs of closed nbh $N[u_{i}]$ in $G$, $1 \\leq i \\leq k$, $k\\in\\mathbb{N}$. A labeling $f: V(G) \\rightarrow \\left\\{1,2,\\ldots,n\\right\\} $ is called a \\emph{Distance Magic Labeling (DML)} of $G$ if ~ ${\\sum_{v \\in N(u)}} f(v) $ is a constant for every $u\\in V(G)$. $G$ is called a \\emph{Distance Magic graph (DMG)} if it has a DML, otherwise it is called a \\emph{Non-Distance Magic (NDM)} graph. In this paper, we define nbh walk, nbh trial, nbh path or nbh chain, nbh cycle, nbh sequence graph and nbh chains of Type-1 (NC-T1) and Type-2 (NC-T2). NC-T2 is formed on two NC-T1 of same length. We prove that (i) for $k \\geq 2$ and $n \\geq 3$, cylindrical grid graph $P_{k} \\Box C_{n}$ contains NC-T2, $k,n \\in \\mathbb{N}$; (ii) graph containing NC-T1 of even length is NDM and (iii) partially settle a conjecture that graphs $P_m \\Box C_n$ are NDM when $n$ is even, $m \\geq 2$, $n \\geq 3$ and $m,n\\in\\mathbb{N}$.",

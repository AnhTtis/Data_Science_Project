\section{Choosing a distributed ledger}
The state manager smart contract can run on two different distributed ledgers: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Ethereum (or other EVM-compatible ledgers)
    \item Hyperledger Fabric
\end{enumerate}
The verifier part of the smart contract for Ethereum is exported from ZoKrates. For Hyperledger Fabric We used the Zokrates fabric verifier we designed.

 @article{Fill_Härer, title={{Knowledge Blockchains}}, abstractNote={Blockchains permit to store information in a tamper-resistant and irrevocable manner by reverting to distributed computing and cryptographic technologies. The primary purpose is to keep track of the ownership of tangible and intangible assets. In the paper at hand we apply these concepts and technologies to the domain of knowledge management. Based on the explication of knowledge in the form of enterprise models this permits the application of socalled knowledge proofs for a. enabling the transparent monitoring of knowledge evolution, b. tracking the provenance, ownership, and relationships of knowledge in an organization, c. establishing delegation schemes for knowledge management, and d. ensuring the existence of patterns in models via zeroknowledge proofs. To validate the technical feasibility of the approach a first technical implementation is described and applied to a fictitious use case.}, author={Fill, Hans-Georg and Härer, Felix}, pages={10}, language={en} }

 @article{Laud, title={{Zero-Knowledge Proofs for Business Processes}}, abstractNote={Every day the amount of private and sensitive information shared in the Internet increases. This means that there is also a growing need for solutions to protect this information. There are various eﬀective technologies used to protect or hide private and sensitive information, but even better approach would be to reduce the need for sharing this information through the Internet at all. In many cases, zero-knowledge proofs could be used, replacing the shared sensitive information with proofs based on this information. As zero-knowledge proofs have a lot of potential, but they are not widely used in practical applications yet, this thesis presents a tool that supports two goals – ﬁrstly, making systems more secure and privacy-preserving, and secondly, bringing zero-knowledge proofs more into practical applications. This paper describes a tool that allows to prove, based on a description of a system (a process) expressed as a business process model in BPMN notation, that the system (a process) has under certain conditions some stated properties, for example, that there is a ﬂaw in it. For example, one may prove that a purchase process satisfying certain conditions allows one to receive the product without actually paying for it, without disclosing how this is achieved. For constructing and verifying the proofs, the tool uses the zkSNARK protocol provided by libsnark.}, author={Laud, Peeter}, pages={83}, language={en} }

Processing transactions at every node in the system limits the system’s ability to scale. Furthermore, the requirement to publish all corporate or individual information for processing at every node, essentially making the data public, is - despite of all other advantages - often considered a major obstacle to blockchain adoption. In this paper, we make two main contributions to address these two problems: (i) To increase efficiency, we propose a processing model which employs non-interactive proofs to off-chain computations, thereby reducing on-chain computational efforts to the verification of correctness of execution rather than the execution itself. Due to the verifiable computation scheme’s zero-knowledge property, private information used in the off-chain computation does not have to become public to verify correctness. (ii) We introduce ZoKrates, a toolbox to specify, integrate and deploy such off-chain computations. It consists of a domain-specific language, a compiler, and generators for proofs and verification Smart Contracts. ZoKrates hides significant complexity inherent to zero-knowledge proofs, provides a more familiar and higher level of programming abstractions to developers and enables circuit integration, hence fostering adoption.}, booktitle={2018 IEEE International Conference on Internet of Things (iThings) and IEEE Green Computing and Communications (GreenCom) and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing (CPSCom) and IEEE Smart Data (SmartData)}, author={Eberhardt, Jacob and Tai, Stefan}, year={2018},

 @article{caterpillar, title={Caterpillar: A business process execution engine on the Ethereum blockchain}, volume={49}, ISSN={1097-024X}, DOI={10.1002/spe.2702}, abstractNote={Blockchain platforms, such as Ethereum, allow a set of actors to maintain a ledger of transactions without relying on a central authority and to deploy programs, called smart contracts, that are executed whenever certain transactions occur. These features can be used as basic building blocks for executing collaborative business processes between mutually untrusting parties. However, implementing business processes using the low-level primitives provided by blockchain platforms is cumbersome and error-prone. In contrast, established business process management systems (BPMSs), such as those based on the standard Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN), provide convenient abstractions for rapid development of process-oriented applications. This article demonstrates how to combine the advantages of a BPMS with those of a blockchain platform. The article introduces a blockchain-based BPMN execution engine, named Caterpillar. Like any BPMN execution engine, Caterpillar supports the creation of instances of a process model and allows users to monitor the state of process instances and to execute tasks thereof. The specificity of Caterpillar is that the state of each process instance is maintained on the (Ethereum) blockchain and the workflow routing is performed by smart contracts generated by a BPMN-to-Solidity compiler. The Caterpillar compiler supports a large array of BPMN constructs, including subprocesses, multiple-instance activities, and event handlers. The paper describes the architecture of Caterpillar and the interfaces it provides to support the monitoring of process instances, the allocation and execution of work items, and the execution of service tasks.}, number={7}, journal={Software: Practice and Experience}, author={López-Pintado, Orlenys and García-Bañuelos, Luciano and Dumas, Marlon and Weber, Ingo and Ponomarev, Alexander}, year={2019}, pages={1162–1193}, language={en} }

 abstractNote={Blockchain is an emergent technology which enables the execution of collaborative business processes while ensuring trust by replacing central authority with cryptographic proof and distributed consensus. Thus, Blockchain technology can be used to find agreement between untrusted collaborating parties in business processes. However, temporal constraints of processes need more investigation. Indeed, Blockchain platforms do not offer means to represent nor to manage temporal constraints for business processes. Moreover, transaction completion time is not fixed, it can take from a few seconds to several minutes. In this paper, we include temporal constraints in smart contracts, which could mitigate the violation of time constraints, minimize the costly execution time, and avoiding thus financial penalties. To achieve this, we extend Caterpillar tool, which is the first open-source blockchain-based BPMN execution engine, to enable the automatic transformation of a large set of temporal constraints for business process model to smart contract code. We illustrate our approach with a use case, which we deploy in Ethereum Testnet.},

 @article{lorikeet, title={{Integrated model-driven engineering of blockchain applications for business processes and asset management}}, volume={51}, ISSN={1097-024X}, DOI={10.1002/spe.2931}, abstractNote={Blockchain has attracted broad interests to build decentralised applications. A typical class of applications uses blockchain for the management of cross-organisational business processes as well as assets. However, developing such applications without introducing vulnerabilities is hard for developers, not the least because the deployed code is immutable and can be called by anyone with access to the network. Model-driven engineering (MDE) helps to reduce those risks, by combining proven code snippets as per the model specification, which is easier to understand than source code. Therefore, in this article, we present an approach for integrated MDE across business processes and asset management (e.g., for settlement). Our approach includes methods for fungible/non-fungible asset registration, escrow for conditional payment, and asset swap. The proposed MDE approach is implemented in a smart contract generation tool called Lorikeet, and evaluated in terms of feasibility, functional correctness, and cost effectiveness.}, number={5}, journal={Software: Practice and Experience},

Under the assumption that secure encryption functions exist or by using “physical means for hiding information, ‘‘ it is shown that all languages in NP have zero-knowledge proofs.

These developments influence the structure and behavior of the business processes that represent the work and of the Business Process Management Systems (BPMS) that support them. Consequently, the architecture of BPMS has changed a lot over the past two decades. However, there is no systematic overview of the research done in this area since the Workflow reference model first set the standard for BPMS architecture in 1995. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of BPMS architectures, by analyzing 41 primary studies taken from a gross collection of 608 research papers. The BPMS architectures that served as primary studies were compared with respect to the reference architecture that they are based on, the level of elaboration at which they are described, the architectural styles that they use, the means with which they are evaluated, and the functionality that they support. The resulting comparison provides an overview of and insights into the current body of knowledge on BPMS architectures.}

One of the challenges of blockchain is the particular processing of dynamic queries due to accumulating costs. Complex Event Processing (CEP) provides efficient and effective support for this in a way, however, that is difficult to integrate with blockchain. This paper addresses the research challenges of integrating blockchain with CEP. More specifically, we envision an effective development environment in which (i) event-driven smart contracts are modeled in a graphical way, which are, in turn, (ii) automatically transformed into complementary code that is deployed in both a CEP engine and a blockchain network, and then (iii) executed on off-chain CEP applications which, connected to different data sources and sinks, automatically invoke smart contracts when event pattern conditions are met. We follow a classic systems engineering approach for defining the concepts of our system, called CEPchain, which addresses the described requirements. CEPchain was evaluated using a real-world case study for vaccine delivery, which requires an unbroken cold chain. The results demonstrate that our approach can be applied without requiring experts on event processing and smart contract languages.

They enable blockchain technology to play a vital role in many fields, such as finance, health care, and energy. An important aspect of modeling and deploying smart contracts is to define the business process and rules that govern the agreements under which the corresponding actions are executed. Unfortunately, these models use a mix of technical and business-centric terminologies that are different based on the underlying blockchain platform that the smart contract is targeting. To address this issue, in this paper, we followed a feature-oriented domain analysis approach to identify the commonalities and variations between three of the common blockchain platforms that are used to deploy smart contracts; namely IBM Hyperledger Composer, Azure Blockchain Workbench, and Ethereum. Accordingly, we propose a reference model for smart contracts. The reference model is then realized as a modeling framework that enables developers to model and generate the structural code required to deploy a smart contract onto multiple blockchain platforms. The coverage of the proposed reference model was shown through mapping the concepts of the reference models to its corresponding constructs within each blockchain platform. Moreover, we provide three use cases to show how the proposed framework can empower developers to generate the structural code of smart contracts for the target platform through model transformation.}, booktitle={Proceedings of the 12th System Analysis and Modelling Conference}, publisher={Association for Computing Machinery}, author={Hamdaqa, Mohammad and Metz, Lucas Alberto Pineda and Qasse, Ilham}, year={2020}, month={Oct}, pages={34–43}, collection={SAM ’20} }

  abstractNote={Blockchain has attracted broad interests to build decentralised applications. A typical class of applications uses blockchain for the management of cross-organisational business processes as well as assets. However, developing such applications without introducing vulnerabilities is hard for developers, not the least because the deployed code is immutable and can be called by anyone with access to the network. Model-driven engineering (MDE) helps to reduce those risks, by combining proven code snippets as per the model specification, which is easier to understand than source code. Therefore, in this article, we present an approach for integrated MDE across business processes and asset management (e.g., for settlement). Our approach includes methods for fungible/non-fungible asset registration, escrow for conditional payment, and asset swap. The proposed MDE approach is implemented in a smart contract generation tool called Lorikeet, and evaluated in terms of feasibility, functional correctness, and cost effectiveness.},

Some of these platforms, such as Ethereum, provide support for implementing smart contracts, which are envisioned to have novel applications in a broad range of areas, including finance and the Internet-of-Things. However, a significant number of smart contracts deployed in practice suffer from security vulnerabilities, which enable malicious users to steal assets from a contract or to cause damage. Vulnerabilities present a serious issue since contracts may handle financial assets of considerable value, and contract bugs are non-fixable by design. To help developers create more secure smart contracts, we introduce FSolidM, a framework rooted in rigorous semantics for designing contracts as Finite State Machines (FSM). We present a tool for creating FSM on an easy-to-use graphical interface and for automatically generating Ethereum contracts. Further, we introduce a set of design patterns, which we implement as plugins that developers can easily add to their contracts to enhance security and functionality.}, booktitle={Financial Cryptography and Data Security}, publisher={Springer}, author={Mavridou, Anastasia and Laszka, Aron}, editor={Meiklejohn, Sarah and Sako, Kazue}, year={2018}, pages={523–540}, collection={Lecture Notes in Computer Science}, language={en} }
 @inproceedings{Rocha_Ducasse_2018, title={{Preliminary Steps Towards Modeling Blockchain Oriented Software}}, abstractNote={Even though blockchain is mostly popular for its cryptocurrency, smart contracts have become a very prominent blockchain application. Smart contracts are like classes that can be called by client applications outside the blockchain. Therefore it is possible to develop blockchain-oriented software (BOS) that implements part of the business logic in the blockchain by using smart contracts. Currently, there is no design standard to model BOS. Since modeling is an important part of designing a software, developers may struggle to plan their BOS. In this paper, we show three complementary modeling approaches based on well-known software engineering models and apply them to a BOS example. Our goal is to start the discussion on specialized blockchain modeling notations.}, booktitle={2018 IEEE/ACM 1st International Workshop on Emerging Trends in Software Engineering for Blockchain (WETSEB)}, author={Rocha, Henrique and Ducasse, Stéphane}, year={2018}, month={May}, pages={52–57} }

There are many situations that prove the existence of this problem: lack of trust between actors, lack of information about defected products within business transactions, exception handling, actors performing workarounds and not conforming prescriptions, etc. To tackle this problem, we consider knowledge from (i) DEMO, an Enterprise Ontology that models business transactions and human interactions on organizations, and (ii) Blockchain, a technology that eliminates the need of intermediaries, provides trust among the actors and traceability over business transactions. Hyperledger Composer (HC) is a toolset example to develop Blockchain applications. This paper relates and integrates concepts between DEMO business transactions and HC, then applies the conceptualization to a context of business transactions supporting food supply and distribution. Moreover, an initial prototype implementation, supported on HC with two-clients using a user interface, shows traceability and control capabilities.}, booktitle={Advances in Enterprise Engineering XII}, publisher={Springer International Publishing}, author={Silva, Diogo and Guerreiro, Sérgio and Sousa, Pedro}, editor={Aveiro, David and Guizzardi, Giancarlo and Guerreiro, Sérgio and Guédria, Wided}, year={2019}, pages={69–87}, collection={Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing}, language={en} }

However, the lack of trust is often a roadblock. Blockchain is an emerging technology for decentralized and transactional data sharing across a network of untrusted participants. It can be used to find agreement about the shared state of collaborating parties without trusting a central authority or any particular participant. Some blockchain networks also provide a computational infrastructure to run autonomous programs called smart contracts. In this paper, we address the fundamental problem of trust in collaborative process execution using blockchain. We develop a technique to integrate blockchain into the choreography of processes in such a way that no central authority is needed, but trust maintained. Our solution comprises the combination of an intricate set of components, which allow monitoring or coordination of business processes. We implemented our solution and demonstrate its feasibility by applying it to three use case processes. Our evaluation includes the creation of more than 500 smart contracts and the execution over 8,000 blockchain transactions.}, booktitle={Business Process Management}, publisher={Springer International Publishing}, author={Weber, Ingo and Xu, Xiwei and Riveret, Régis and Governatori, Guido and Ponomarev, Alexander and Mendling, Jan}, editor={La Rosa, Marcello and Loos, Peter and Pastor, Oscar}, year={2016}, pages={329–347}, collection={Lecture Notes in Computer Science}, language={en} }

abstract="Model-driven tools frequently rely on advanced technologies to support model queries, view maintenance, design rule validation, model transformations or design space exploration. Some of these features are initiated explicitly by domain engineers (batch execution) while others are executed automatically when certain trigger events are detected (live execution). Unfortunately, their integration into a complex industrial modeling environment is difficult due to hidden interference and unspecified interaction between different features. In this paper, we present a reactive, event-driven model transformation platform over EMF models, which captures tool features as model queries and transformations, and provides a systematic, well-founded integration between a variety of such tool features. Viatra 3 offers a family of internal DSLs (i.e. dedicated libraries) to specify advanced tool features built on top of existing languages like EMF-IncQuery and Xtend. Its main innovation is a source incremental execution scheme built on the reactive programming paradigm ssupported by an event-driven virtual machine.",

abstract = {BPMN collaboration models have acquired increasing relevance in software development since they shorten the communication gap between domain experts and IT specialists and permit clarifying the characteristics of software systems needed to provide automatic support for the activities of complex organizations. Nonetheless, the lack of effective formal verification capabilities can hinder the full adoption of the BPMN standard by IT specialists, as it prevents precisely check the satisfaction of behavioral properties, with negative impacts on the quality of the software. To address these issues, this paper proposes BProVe, a novel verification approach for BPMN collaborations. This combines both standard model checking techniques, through the MAUDE’s LTL model checker, and statistical model checking techniques, through the statistical analyzer MultiVeStA. The latter makes BProVe effective also on those scenarios suffering from the state–space explosion problem, made even more acute by the presence of asynchronous message exchanges. To support the adoption of the BProVe approach, we propose a complete web-based tool-chain that allows for BPMN modeling, verification, and result exploration. The feasibility of BProVe has been validated both on synthetically-generated models and on models retrieved from two public repositories. The performed validation highlighted the importance and complementarity of the two supported verification strategies.}

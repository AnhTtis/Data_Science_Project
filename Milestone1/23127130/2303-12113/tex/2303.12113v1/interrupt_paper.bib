	url = {https://repository.library.northeastern.edu/files/neu:m046qf41d},
	abstract = {Group meetings are ubiquitous, with millions of meetings held across the world every day. However, meeting quality, group performance, and outcomes are challenged by a variety of dysfunctional behaviors, unproductive social dynamics, and lack of experience in conducting efficient and productive meetings. Previous studies have shown that meeting facilitators can be advantageous in helping groups reach their goals more effectively. However, many groups do not have access to a human facilitator due to a lack of resources or other barriers. In this work, I leverage advances in conversational agent technology to provide some of the functionality of human facilitators in group decision-making using an automated system. I present a general computational framework for automated meeting facilitation that provides a real-time, co-located, synchronous, multiparty, personified interface to a group conducting a face-to-face meeting. The framework is designed to support a range of virtual and robotic embodiments of the agent, and provides facilitation functions based on group management science, including a) management of meeting structure; b) management of participation to avoid dominance; and c) management of conflict. Using this framework, I report on three prototypes and their evaluation to address a series of research questions. I first explored the overall acceptance of a conversational agent in the role of a meeting facilitator and compared reactions and outcomes to different agent embodiments in the meeting room, finding that embodiment improved participants' rapport with and trust of the agent as well as their perceptions of the agent's intelligence and power. Second, I developed a fully automated meeting facilitation robot that uses multimodal inputs to manage the multiparty conversation, enforce meeting structure, promote time management, balance group participation, and facilitate group decision-making processes. Results of a between-subject study showed that the robot facilitator was accepted by group members, was effective in enforcing meeting structure, and that users found it helpful in balancing group participation. Finally, I developed and evaluated conflict management strategies for the facilitation robot and evaluated them in a task setting designed to evoke task conflict. I found that participants complied with the robot's intervention, performing active listening with each other when conflicts arose. I also report on qualitative findings from interviews with study participants and a focus group, highlighting the potential role for robots in meetings of the future.},

Transferring these cues into the design of robots and other artificial agents that interact with people may foster more natural, inviting, and accessible experiences. In this position paper, we offer a series of definitive nonverbal codes for human-robot interaction (HRI) that address the five human sensory systems (visual, auditory, haptic, olfactory, gustatory) drawn from the field of communication studies. We discuss how these codes can be translated into design patterns for HRI using a curated sample of the communication studies and HRI literatures. As nonverbal codes are an essential mode in human communication, we argue that integrating robotic nonverbal codes in HRI will afford robots a feeling of “aliveness” or “social agency” that would otherwise be missing. We end with suggestions for research directions to stimulate work on nonverbal communication within the field of HRI and improve communication between human and robots.},

In two studies with 699 people, working in groups of two to five, we find converging evidence of a general collective intelligence factor that explains a group’s performance on a wide variety of tasks. This “c factor” is not strongly correlated with the average or maximum individual intelligence of group members but is correlated with the average social sensitivity of group members, the equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking, and the proportion of females in the group.},

Using decades of research from psychology, HRI research is increasingly trying to understand how robots impact the dynamics and outcomes of these small groups. Current work almost exclusively uses humanoid robots that take on the role of an active group participant to influence interpersonal dynamics. We argue that this has limitations and propose an alternative design approach of using a peripheral robotic object. This paper presents Micbot, a peripheral robotic object designed to promote participant engagement and ultimately performance using nonverbal implicit interactions. The robot is evaluated in a 3 condition (no movement, engagement behaviour, random movement) laboratory experiment with 36 three-person groups (N=108). Results showed that the robot was effective in promoting not only increased group engagement but also improved problem solving performance. In the engagement condition, participants displayed more even backchanneling toward one another, compared to no movement, but not to the random movement. This more even distribution of backchanneling predicted better problem solving performance.},

Four is the special number in multiparty conversations. In three-participant conversations, the minimum unit for multiparty conversations, social imbalance, in which a participant is left behind in the current conversation, sometimes occurs. In such scenarios, a conversational robot has the potential to objectively observe and control situations as the fourth participant. Consequently, we present model procedures for obtaining conversational initiatives in incremental steps to harmonize such four-participant conversations. During the procedures, a facilitator must be aware of both the presence of dominant participants leading the current conversation and the status of any participant that is left behind. We model and optimize these situations and procedures as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), which is suitable for real-world sequential decision processes. The results of experiments conducted to evaluate the proposed procedures show evidence of their acceptability and feeling of groupness.},

No hypothesized differences in contagion effects due to the degree of pleasantness of the mood expressed and the energy level with which it was conveyed were found. There was a significant influence of emotional contagion on individual-level attitudes and group processes.

Affective reactions and inferential processes mediate the effects of emotional expressions on observers’ behaviors, and the relative potency of these mediators depends on the observers’ information processing and the perceived appropriateness of the emotional expressions. The social effects of emotions are similar across expressive modalities (face, voice, body, text, symbols). We discuss the findings in relation to emotional contagion, emotional intelligence, emotion regulation, emotions as social information (EASI) theory, and the functionality of emotions in engendering social influence.

We begin by defining emotional contagion, reviewing ways to assess this phenomenon, and discussing individual differences that influence susceptibility to emotional contagion. We then explore the key role of emotional contagion in organizational life across a wide range of domains, including (1) team processes and outcomes, (2) leadership, (3) employee work attitudes, (4) decision-making, and (5) customer attitudes. Across each of these domains, we present a body of organizational behavior research that finds evidence of the influence of emotional contagion on a variety of attitudinal, cognitive, and behavioral/performance outcomes as well as identify the key boundary conditions of the emotional contagion phenomenon. To support future scholarship in this domain, we identify several new frontiers of emotional contagion research, including the need to better understand the “tipping point” of positive versus negative emotional contagion, the phenomenon of counter-contagion, and the influence of computer mediated communication and technology within organizations and society on emotional contagion. In closing, we summarize our model of emotional contagion in organizations, which we hope can serve as a catalyst for future research on this important phenomenon and its myriad effects on organizational life.},

	abstract = {In their famous article published in 1974, Sacks, Schegloff, and Jefferson studied the organization of turn-taking in conversations, and proposed a model alleged to be both context- and content- independent. However, they evoke specific exchange formats where the system of rules in effect is obviously not the one described in the model. These include meetings, interviews, debates, and ceremonies, to which we might add, among other things, speech exchanges in the school or in a legal environment. Some of these formats have since been described, namely, classroom conversation (Sinclair and Coulthard 1975; Coulthard 1977; McHoul 1978). But as Sacks, Schegloff, and Jefferson also state, the turn-taking system in effect in informal conversations may be a central component of the one that governs more formal interactions, such that the formal system would in some sense have an additional set of secondary-level features not contained in the informal system and that different turn-taking systems [may be] involved (Sacks et al. 1974: 701). The present article attempts to demonstrate this by studying the turn-taking sequence of a political meeting. After presenting an excerpt of the meeting, we shall first briefly summarize the rules governing turn-taking in ordinary conversations in order to examine (1) how the rules are modified in this particular context, and (2) how the participants orient themselves with respect to those rules. We shall see that this particular turn-taking system, hereafter called the specific system, generates conversational problems of its own and provides strategic opportunities for the meeting's participants.},

We identified five backchannel categories: process-oriented, content-oriented, participation-enabling, tangential and independent backchannel. Software designers can use these results to understand how backchannel should function in digital conversation applications. Making backchannel overtly available for study would require making its presence and content visible and its content persist, affecting the nature of the backchannel and raising social and ethical issues.},

In learning settings with a large and typically passive audience, the goal of Backstage is to foster active participation and facilitate collaboration akin to small‐learning groups. Design/methodology/approach – The authors present the concept of a novel kind of digital backchannel that supports different forms of inter‐student communication via short microblog messages, social evaluation, and ranking of messages by the audience. The backchannel further supports immediate concise feedback to the lecturer of selected and aggregated students' opinions, making it possible to strengthen the lecturer's awareness of students' difficulties. Findings – The concept is the outcome of a joint effort between computer scientists and educational scientists, and unifies technical and usability aspects with educational claims. Originality/value – The concept combines computer‐mediated communication with elements of social media that not only foster active participation and collaboration among a large and otherwise passive audience, but also provide social means to self‐regulation and management of the backchannel discourse. The design of the backchannel is strongly influenced by findings of educational sciences.},

	shorttitle = {Social mirrors},

	abstract = {Social cues shape our interactions and the way others see us. We convey a persona through our actions and words, but we are not always aware of how we are seen and interpreted. We use cues to coordinate conversation, determine speaker, and sense the mood of a group. However, online social spaces have expanded the ways in which we interact with others. Due to the nature of online communication, interactions persist in a manner that allows us to review our action. Otherwise devoid of traditional social cues, online places offer different mechanisms for mediation and feedback that are often not available in face-to-face conversation. 
This dissertation applies affordances of computer mediated communication such as persistency, anonymity, large group backchannels, and archival into realized conceptions of a Social Mirror — a visualization to augment real-time conversation with additional feedback. The Social Mirrors capture interaction patterns and reflect visually aesthetic representations in real-time. The designs demonstrate additional cues alongside the traditional social cues one might expect by integrating this feedback directly into the conversation space. I show how this feedback influences the perception of self to change interaction, encourage self-evaluation and enable participants in conversation.
 
In the first chapters of this work, I establish that feedback from the social mirror affects people differently based on what the social expectations dictate. These mirrors, and those in related work, consistently demonstrate a balancing of conversation. This is not because the visualizations direct an individual to change; rather, the participants shape themselves into a perceived balance with each other through the mirror. In a mirrored conversation, the talkative back off and the quiet speak up while reporting their contribution was respectively dominating the social mirror and lacking from the social mirror.
More important than the individual projects, the concept of the social mirror provides a tool for group interaction. With social mirrors, groups gain access to new cues in real-time, but can continue to mediate interaction through self-directed means. The underlying theoretical construct I contribute (presented in Chapter 3) defines the characteristics of social mirrors leveraged in this work: capturing interaction data, visualizing this data, and encouraging reflection on this data. The four example social mirrors — Conversation Clock, Conversation Votes, Fragmented Social Mirror, and Conversation Clusters — illustrate the social mirror as applied to conversation, however social mirrors can have broader applications that I hope contribute with future developments in other domains.
Specifically, this dissertation presents five contributions. First, I put forth the Social Mirror as a theoretical construct. I describe the necessary characteristics based in social visualization with influence from signaling theory, group dynamics, and accommodation theory. Social mirrors capture interaction, visually construct a cue, and feed that information right back into the current interaction and are not limited to my own designs. It is a feedback loop of self-evaluation that creates otherwise inaccessible social cues. Second, I present my visualizations for their design contributions. Each mirror combines abstracted audio visualization and augmented spaces with informative and aesthetic imagery. Each visualization leverages design to inform the viewer in an environment that is already visually demanding attention. In order to convey meaning, I rely on a well designed structure with minimal distractions. In this dissertation, I present the unique design challenges and visual solutions to ensure that the abstracted audio is a beneficial augmentation to conversation. Third, I demonstrate that the presence of a visualization encourages a “balanced” conversation. This is not because of the demands of the visualizations, but because the participants shape themselves into a perceived balance with each other through the mirror. I demonstrate this link initially with the Conversation Clock in terms of contribution: the talkative back off and the quiet speak up. This effect persists with the addition of approval/disapproval feedback in Conversation Votes. Most importantly, a greatly distorted visualization has relatively little effect on this balance. The presence of these social mirrors and reminder of a person’s activity is more than enough to encourage “balance.” Fourth, I demonstrate that explicit but anonymous feedback can empower individuals in conversation. Rather than refraining from participating, participants use the anonymous backchannel to express their opinion without the need to speak up. This channel leads to more speaking and more student initiated questions in a classroom setting. Finally, I present a social mirror that demonstrates how the context of conversation can be detected and incorporated into the social mirror. Accounting for poor speech recognition, the Conversation Clusters mirror allows a social mirror timeline to be automatically annotated by topic for longer archival and review. As a whole, this dissertation presents the social mirror as an interface to improve upon self reflection in conversation. Each project presented illustrates the use and benefit of such mirrors and opens the doors to additional mirrors by others.},

	abstract = {In online group discussions, balanced participation can improve the quality of discussion, members' satisfaction, and positive group dynamics. One approach to achieve balanced participation is to deploy a conversational agent (CA) that encourages participation of under-contributing members, and it is important to design communication strategies of the CA in a way that is supportive to the group. We implemented five communication strategies that a CA can use during a decision-making task in a small group synchronous chat discussion. The five strategies include messages sent to two types of recipients (@username vs. @everyone) crossed by two separate channels (public vs. private), and a peer-mediated strategy where the CA asks a peer to address the under-contributing member. Through an online study with 42 groups, we measured the balance of participation and perceptions about the CA by analyzing chat logs and survey responses. We found that the CA sending messages specifying an individual through a private channel is the most effective and preferred way to increase participation of under-contributing members. Participants also expressed that the peer-mediated strategy is a less intrusive and less embarrassing way of receiving the CA's messages compared to the conventional approach where the CA directly sends a message to the under-contributing member. Based on our findings, we discuss trade-offs of various communication strategies and explain design considerations for building an effective CA that adapts to different group dynamics and situations.},

They import hierarchical structures from larger society and help perpetuate them by creating inequalities in the ability to accomplish interactional goals. In this study of speaker transitions in six-person, task-oriented experimental groups, we explore the well-known finding that men interrupt women more frequently than women interrupt men. We ask three questions about the structure of interruptions. Who attempts to interrupt whom and under what conditions? How does the affective character of interruptions vary across speakers and groups? What determines whether an interruption succeeds? We find that gender inequality in these task-oriented discussions is created by a mixture of attempts to use power and of differential success. In their interruptions, men discriminate by sex in attempts and in yielding to interruptions by others. Women interrupt and yield the floor to males and females equally. The sex composition of the group affects interruption patterns in complex ways. Men interrupt men with supportive comments in all-male groups, but these supportive interruptions drop as the number of women in the group increases. Supportive interruptions also succeed in gaining the floor more often in single-sex groups. Taken together, the results suggest a mixture of status and conflict models and reaffirm the importance of group composition in interaction.},

	abstract = {The taking of turns is a fundamental aspect of dialogue. Since it is difficult to speak and listen at the same time, the participants need to coordinate who is currently speaking and when the next person can start to speak. Humans are very good at this coordination, and typically achieve fluent turn-taking with very small gaps and little overlap. Conversational systems (including voice assistants and social robots), on the other hand, typically have problems with frequent interruptions and long response delays, which has called for a substantial body of research on how to improve turn-taking in conversational systems. In this review article, we provide an overview of this research and give directions for future research. First, we provide a theoretical background of the linguistic research tradition on turn-taking and some of the fundamental concepts in theories of turn-taking. We also provide an extensive review of multi-modal cues (including verbal cues, prosody, breathing, gaze and gestures) that have been found to facilitate the coordination of turn-taking in human-human interaction, and which can be utilised for turn-taking in conversational systems. After this, we review work that has been done on modelling turn-taking, including end-of-turn detection, handling of user interruptions, generation of turn-taking cues, and multi-party human-robot interaction. Finally, we identify key areas where more research is needed to achieve fluent turn-taking in spoken interaction between man and machine.},

Nevertheless, it is an important one to achieve if the goal is to realise a naturalistic communication between humans and machines. Machines that are able to sense social attitudes like agreement and disagreement and respond to them in a meaningful way are likely to be welcomed by users due to the more natural, efficient and human‐centred interaction they are bound to experience. This paper surveys the nonverbal behavioural cues that could be present during displays of agreement and disagreement; discusses a number of methods that could be used or adapted to detect these suggested cues; lists some publicly available databases these tools could be trained on for the analysis of spontaneous, audiovisual instances of agreement and disagreement, it examines the few existing attempts at agreement and disagreement classification, and finally discusses the challenges in automatically detecting agreement and disagreement.},

Next a detailed review of 67 peer-reviewed papers from 2000 to 2007 is offered presenting the benefits and challenges associated with the use of an ARS. Key benefits for using ARSs include improvements to the classroom environment (increases in attendance, attention levels, participation and engagement), learning (interaction, discussion, contingent teaching, quality of learning, learning performance), and assessment (feedback, formative, normative). The biggest challenges for teachers in using ARSs are time needed to learn and set up the ARS technology, creating effective ARS questions, adequate coverage of course material, and ability to respond to instantaneous student feedback. Student challenges include adjusting to a new method of learning, increased confusion when multiple perspectives are discussed, and negative reactions to being monitored. It is concluded that more systematic, detailed research is needed in a broader range of contexts.},

All conversations were videotaped and microanalyzed. The data generated four findings: (a) In the Chinese speaker-Chinese listener interactions, cooperative interruptions occurred more frequently than intrusive interruptions; (b) when Canadians served as doctors, the doctors performed significantly more intrusive interruptions than cooperative ones; (c) the two intercultural groups engaged in more unsuccessful interruptions than the two intracultural groups; and (d) in the intercultural conditions, the occurrences of intrusive interruptions were greater than cooperative interruptions. This phenomenon provides unequivocal support for communication accommodation theory. The findings point to a hypothesis that conversational interruption may be a pancultural phenomenon, whereas interruption styles may be culture specific.},

While the notion of engagement is actively being studied in a diverse set of domains, the term has been used to refer to a number of related, but different concepts. In fact it has been referred to across different disciplines under different names and with different connotations in mind. Therefore, it can be quite difficult to understand what the meaning of engagement is and how one study relates to another one accordingly. Engagement has been studied not only in human-human, but also in human-agent interactions i.e., interactions with physical robots and embodied virtual agents. In this overview article we focus on different factors involved in engagement studies, distinguishing especially between those studies that address task and social engagement, involve children and adults, are conducted in a lab or aimed for long term interaction. We also present models for detecting engagement and for generating multimodal behaviors to show engagement.},

We analyse a dataset where pairs of users (540 in total) interact with a conversational robot exhibited at a technical museum. The data encompass a wide range of different users in terms of age (adults/children) and gender (male/female), in different combinations. Overall, the analysis indicates that demographically heterogeneous pairs are more imbalanced, especially pairs of adults and children, where children are less prone to self-select in the turn-taking. The analysis also indicates that it is possible for the robot to reduce the imbalance by addressing the least dominant user and asking directed questions. However, for children to respond, it is important to seek mutual gaze and switch addressee often. Finally, we show that it is possible to predict the imbalance at an early stage in the interaction -- in order to increase the participation equality as early as possible -- and that knowledge about the users' age and gender helps in this prediction.},

High-quality conversational listening not only requires the cognitive processes of attention and processing, but also behavioral expression to communicate one's cognitive engagement to others. This need to behaviorally express listening introduces the possibility of deception. Listening can be expressed using non-verbal, paralinguistic, and verbal behaviors. However, recent work reveals that perceptions of conversational listening are often inaccurate—dishonest portrayals of listening often go undetected, while honest portrayals are sometimes mistaken for deception. This article will review work on listening, arguing that honest high-quality conversational listening is most effectively conveyed (and detected) using verbal expressions of listening, in part because these cues cannot be faked.},

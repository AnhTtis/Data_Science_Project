\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we investigate SSM as it relates to temporal tasks that require understanding both commonsense and world knowledge questions and propose a new intermediate training method which selects spans generated by a temporal parser. 
These intermediate training strategies result in the best overall reported results on the selected downstream tasks. 
However, we find that even the entity spans from SSM are helpful for temporal tasks, likely because entity-containing examples also contain informative temporal knowledge.

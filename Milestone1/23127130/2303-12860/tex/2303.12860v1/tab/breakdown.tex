\caption{Aggregated performance across types for baselines and the best overall model (\textsc{Entities}+TSM). For TimeDIAL, each answer span is labeled by \textsc{sutime}. Duration includes MC-TACO's ``Event Duration''; Set includes MC-TACO's ``Frequency'', Time and Date both include MC-TACO's ``Typical Time''; Date also includes SituatedQA; Entities include all of MC-TACO and SituatedQA. Note that the majority of the gains from SSM/TSM seem to be from Entities and Dates. See \autoref{app:discussion_appendix} for rationale behind these choices.

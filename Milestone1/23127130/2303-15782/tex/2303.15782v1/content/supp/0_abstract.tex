In this supplementary material, we first describe our model architecture in more detail in \cref{supp:sec:model_architectures}. Next, we detail our backward optimization procedure in \cref{supp:sec:backward_optim}. In \cref{supp:sec:joint_code_space}, we visualize the difference between joint code spaces trained with and without our regularization and show the fitted polynomial functions, previously introduced in \ifthenelse{\boolean{reftomain}}{\cref{subsec:inverse_joint_decoder}}{Sec.~3.3.3}. Subsequently, we present example images from our synthetic and real dataset in \cref{supp:sec:datasets}. Lastly, in \cref{supp:sec:additional_metric}, we report extended results for our canonical reconstruction task in \ifthenelse{\boolean{reftomain}}{\cref{subsec:canonical_reconstruction_task}}{Sec.~4.2} and our full pipeline experiment in \ifthenelse{\boolean{reftomain}}{\cref{subsec:full_pipeline_task}}{Sec.~4.3}.

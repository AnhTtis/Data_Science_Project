Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the meeting was held hybridly, on September 23-24, 2022.  LSFA aims to bring together researchers and students interested in theoretical and practical aspects of logical and semantic frameworks and their applications.  The covered topics include proof theory, type theory and rewriting theory, specification and deduction languages, and formal semantics of languages and systems.",

    "abstract": "Simulation of many-body systems is extremely computationally intensive, and tensor network schemes have long been used to make these tasks more tractable via approximation. Recently, tensor network algorithms that can exploit the inherent symmetries of the underlying quantum systems have been proposed to further reduce computational complexity. One class of systems, namely those exhibiting a global U(1) symmetry, is especially interesting. We provide a state-of-the-art, graphical processing unit-accelerated, and highly parallel supercomputer implementation of the tensor network algorithm that takes advantage of U(1) symmetry, opening up the possibility of a wide range of quantum systems for future numerical investigations.",

    "abstract": "We propose a framework for achieving perfect synchronization in complex networks of Sakaguchi-Kuramoto oscillators in presence of higher order interactions (simplicial complexes) at a targeted point in the parameter space. It is achieved by using an analytically derived frequency set from the governing equations. The frequency set not only provides stable perfect synchronization in the network at a desired point, but also proves to be very effective in achieving high level of synchronization around it compared to the choice of any other frequency sets (Uniform, Normal etc.). The proposed framework has been verified using scale-free, random and small world networks. In all the cases, stable perfect synchronization is achieved at a targeted point for wide ranges of the coupling parameters and phase-frustration. Both first and second order transitions to synchronizations are observed in the system depending on the type of the network and phase frustration. The stability of perfect synchronization state is checked using the low dimensional reduction approach. The robustness of the perfect synchronization state obtained in the system using the derived frequency set is checked by introducing a Gaussian noise around it.",

    "abstract": "While finite graphs have tree-decompositions that efficiently distinguish all their tangles, locally finite graphs with thick ends need not have such tree-decompositions. We show that every locally finite graph without thick ends admits such a tree-decomposition, in fact a canonical one. Our proof exhibits a thick end at any obstruction to the existence of such tree-decompositions and builds on new methods for the analysis of the limit behaviour of strictly increasing sequences of separations.",

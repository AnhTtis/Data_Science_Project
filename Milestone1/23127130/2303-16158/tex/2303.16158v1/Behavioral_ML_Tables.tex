 This figure shows the ratio of mean squared errors of human forecasts and machine forecasts at different years. A ratio smaller than one suggests that humans beat the machines in that year.

 This figure shows the change of $\bar x$ when the aggregate state $A$ changes for different $\lambda$'s. The solid line demonstrates the result when there is no tech analyst in the economy, while the dashed line illustrates the result when 90\% analysts use algorithms to make forecasts. The parameter values are given in Table \ref{tab:param}. $\bar x_{t-1}$ is set to be 1000 (small enough so that the optimal $\bar x_t$ is an interior solution), $\epsilon_{t-1} = 10$.

	\begin{footnotesize}    
         This table presents the results of an OLS regression analysis of the forecast error at time $t + 1$. 
         We decompose machine forecast errors into a market-related variation and a firm-specific variation, using the following regression $e_{i,t} = \beta_i + \beta_{i,m} r_{m,t} + \varepsilon_{i,t}$. $e_{i,t}$ is the forecast error of firm $i$ at year $t$, $r_{m,t}$ is the market forecast error at year $t$, which is the equal-weighted average forecast error at year $t$. We define market-related forecast error as $\hat{\beta}_{i,m} r_{m,t}$ and the firm-specific forecast error as $e_{i,t} - \hat{\beta}{i,m} r{m,t}$.
         The dependent variable in column (1) is the market-related forecasting errors of human analysts, while column (2) is the firm-specific forecasting errors of human analysts. The dependent variable in column (3) is the market-related forecasting errors of machine analysts, while column (4) is the firm-specific forecasting errors of machine analysts. Investment$_{t}$ is capital expenditure at time $t$.

	\caption{Predictable Forecast Errors in Linear Models }
        \label{tab:over_ols}
	\begin{footnotesize}    
         This table presents the results of an OLS regression analysis of the forecast error at time $t + 1$ and Wald test results from seemingly unrelated regressions. The forecast error at $t + 1$ is defined as $\text{Forecast Error}{t+1} = p{t+1} - E_t p_{t+1}$, where $E_t p_{t+1}$ is the median earnings forecast based on data from time $t$, and $p_{t+1}$ represents the actual earnings at time $t + 1$. Forecasts are calculated from linear regression models that use different forecasting variables. In column (1), lagged annual earnings of the firm are used as the forecasting variables. In column (2), the forecasting variables include firm characteristics and lagged annual and quarterly earnings. In column (3), the forecasting variables include firm characteristics, analysts forecasts, and lagged annual and quarterly earnings. In column (4), the variables include firm characteristics, analysts forecasts, lagged annual and quarterly earnings, and financial statement items. All earnings are converted to total earnings from EPS forecasts and scaled by total assets. Investment$_{t}$ is capital expenditure at time $t$. Debt issuance$_{t}$ is net debt issuance at time $t$. The $\chi^2$ of the Wald test is used to test the difference of regression coefficients from column (3), with the results of the test presented in the table. The p-value of the test is also included in brackets.

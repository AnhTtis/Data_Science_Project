 \label{tab:over_gmm}
	\begin{footnotesize}      
        This table report GMM regression results of regressing forecast error at $t+1$ on the information at time $t$. Forecast error at $t+1$ is $\text{Forecast Error}_{t+1} \coloneqq p_{t+1} - E_t p_{t+1} $, where $E_t$ is forecast based on date $t$ data. In columns (1), forecast $E_t p_{t+1}$ is the median earnings forecast of all analysts forecasts conducted during fiscal year t. In columns (3), forecast $E_t p_{t+1}$ is the median earnings forecast of all machine learning forecasts conducted during fiscal year t. Earnings are converted from EPS forecast to total earnings. Investment$_{t}$ capital expenditure at time $t$. Debt issuance$_{t}$ is net debt issuance at time $t$. All variables are scaled by total assets.

	\caption{Predictable Forecast Errors Using Large Learning Rates}
        \label{tab:largelr}
	\begin{footnotesize}    
         This table presents the results of an OLS regression analysis of the forecast error at time $t + 1$ and Wald test results from seemingly unrelated regressions. The forecast error at $t + 1$ is defined as $\text{Forecast Error}_{t+1} = p_{t+1} - F_t p_{t+1}$, where $F_t p_{t+1}$ is the average of median monthly earnings forecast based on data from time $t$, and $p_{t+1}$ represents the actual earnings at time $t + 1$. Forecasts are calculated from various machine learning models that use different hyper-parameters. The default hyper-parameters are set as the following values: depth of the tree is $2$ and number of
        trees in the forest is $50$. Table reports the results using different learning rates. Investment$_{t}$ is capital expenditure at time $t$. The $\chi^2$ of the Wald test is used to test the difference of regression coefficients from default hyper parameters, with the results of the test presented in the table. The p-value of the test is also included in brackets.

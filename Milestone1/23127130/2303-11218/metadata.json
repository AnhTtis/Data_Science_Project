    "abstract": "We construct the first known infinite family of quasi-isometry classes of subgroups of hyperbolic groups which are not hyperbolic and are of type $\\mathrm{FP}(\\mathbb{Q})$. We give a simple criterion for producing many non-hyperbolic subgroups of hyperbolic groups with strong finiteness properties. We also observe that local hyperbolicity and algebraic fibring are mutually exclusive in higher dimensions.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an approach for describing wave propagation in finite-size microstructured metamaterials using a reduced relaxed micromorphic model. This method introduces an additional kinematic field with respect to the classical Cauchy continua, allowing to capture the effects of the underlying microstructure with a homogeneous model. The reduced relaxed micromorphic model is not only effective but also efficient for numerical simulations and analysis, making it an essential tool for designing and optimising metamaterials structures with specific wave propagation properties. The proposed model's efficiency is assessed through numerical simulations for finite-size benchmark problems, and shows a good agreement for a wide range of frequencies. The possibility of producing the same macroscopic metamaterial with different but equivalent unit cell ``cuts'' is also analysed, showing that, even close to the boundary, the reduced relaxed micromorphic model is capable of giving accurate responses for some cuts.",

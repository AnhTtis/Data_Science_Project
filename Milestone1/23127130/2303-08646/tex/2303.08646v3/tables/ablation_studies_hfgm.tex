\caption{
Ablation studies on different HFGM settings on Pascal Context dataset.
Using both guidance and AA in HFGM brings the most gain (1.8\% mIOU).
AA and the proposed high-level feature guidance cooperate well probably because AA can effectively back-propagate the guidance signal to all spatial locations.
% HFGM effectively improves the accuracy, especially when it contains an axial attention (AA) layer since AA can effectively back-propagate the guidance signal from the good high-level features (i.e. output of CAE) to all spatial locations, resulting in more accurate upsampled feature representations.

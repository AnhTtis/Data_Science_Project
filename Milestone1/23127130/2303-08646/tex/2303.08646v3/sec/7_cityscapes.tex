\section{Experiments on Cityscapes Dataset}

Cityscapes~\cite{cCityScapes} is a semantic segmentation dataset that consists of high-resolution images of road scenes with accurate annotations.
It has 19 labeled classes and contains 2975/500/1525 training/validation/test images.

\subsection{Ablation studies on feature map resolution}
\label{sec:exps:ablation_os2}
\input{tables/ablation_studies_ct_os2}
%
We mainly conduct ablation experiments on Cityscapes to verify the superiority of using ultra high resolution feature maps (i.e. $OS=2$) since its GT annotations are the most accurate.
% 
We use ResNet-50 as the backbone and train SemanticFPN, HFGD ($OS=4$), and HFGD ($OS=2$) for 30K iterations following the training settings in Sec.~\ref{sec:HFGD:training_settings}. 
%
As shown in Tab.~\ref{tab:ablation_ct_os2}, the $OS=2$ has further improved the accuracy over $OS=4$ by 0.7\% mIOU (79.11 vs 79.81).

\subsection{Comparison with the state-of-the-art methods}
To compare our method against the state-of-the-art, we use ConvNeXt-Large and follow the training settings described in Sec.~\ref{sec:HFGD:training_settings}.
%
Note that we only compare with methods that are trained only on the Cityscapes fine annotations, similar to many works~\cite{cSegFormer,cKMaXDeepLab}.
%
We set the crop size to 513$\times$1025~\cite{cDeepLabV3,cPanopticDeepLab} and train our HFGD model for 60K iterations for the $OS=4$ version and 80K iterations for the $OS=2$ version.
%
As shown in Tab.~\ref{tab:HFGD:SOTA-Cityscapes}, the proposed HFGD outperforms the previous state-of-the-art proposed in recent years on the Cityscapes validation set.

A similar comparison is conducted on the Cityscapes test set, where we set batch size = 32 following kMaXDeepLab~\cite{cKMaXDeepLab}
while the other settings remain unchanged.
%
Results on the test set can fairly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method since no ground-truths are provided.
%
Note that we did not use hard sample mining.
%
As shown in Tab.~\ref{tab:HFGD:test-Cityscapes}, our HFGD sets new state-of-the-art on Cityscapes test set (when only using fine set for training).

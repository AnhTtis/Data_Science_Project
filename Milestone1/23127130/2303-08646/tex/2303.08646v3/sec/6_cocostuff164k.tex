Visual comparisons on Pascal Context between SemanticFPN, Self-Attention + CAR (denoted as ``Dilated OS=8''), and our HFGD.
All models used ResNet-50 as the backbone.
The results are obtained using single-scale without flipping.

COCOStuff164k~\cite{cCocoStuff}, which has become popular in recent years, poses a great challenge for semantic segmentation models due to its high diversity (118k training images and 5000 testing images) and complexity (171 classes). 
% 
We adopt ConvNeXt-Large as our backbone network and follow the training settings described in Sec.~\ref{sec:HFGD:training_settings} and we train our model for 40K iterations.
In Tab.~\ref{tab:HFGD:SOTA-COCOStuff164k}, we compare our proposed HFGD with other state-of-the-art methods.
HFGD outperforms the previous state-of-the-art~\cite{cSegNeXt} by a large margin (49.4\% vs 47.3\% mIOU).

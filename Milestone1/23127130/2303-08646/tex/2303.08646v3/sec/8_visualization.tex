\section{Visualizations}
We present visual comparisons between SemanticFPN and our HFGD on Pascal Context, CocoStuff and Cityscapes in Fig~\ref{fig:CFGD:main-R50-Vis}.

HFGD is clearly more capable of segmenting small/thin objects. 
For example, HFGD even performs better than manual annotation when segmenting very small birds in the sky.
When using OS=2 on Cityscapes, HFGD can segment the remote traffic light partially missed in OS=4
% in Cityscapes, which is partially missing in OS=4, 
which is of great importance in autonomous driving.

\noindent\textbf{UMAP:} We conducted UMAP~\cite{cUMAP} visualization in Fig.~\ref{fig:umap_vis} to analyze the impact of our HFG/HFGD in addressing the issue presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:hfgd:concept}. 
The final layer features used for classification are used (the features produced by the upsampler for HFGD) in this visualization.
Since Pascal Context has 59 classes, we only selected 8 representative error-prone classes (\ie, hard to discriminate, \eg Floor vs Grass vs Ground vs Snow) in Fig.~\ref{fig:umap_vis} for clarity.

% As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:umap_vis}, t
The class discrimination ability of SemanticFPN is slightly worse than FPN.
``SemanticFPN (HFG)'' restores this ability with the help of HFG.
Additionally, our entire HFGD results in more discriminative inter-class and more compact intra-class features.
Our full solution HFGD obtains more discriminative features (\ie more separable inter-class distance and more compact intra-class representation).

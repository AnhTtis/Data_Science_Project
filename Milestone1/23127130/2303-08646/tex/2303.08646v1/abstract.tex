Commonly used backbones for semantic segmentation, such as ResNet and Swin-Transformer, have multiple stages for feature encoding.
%
Simply using high-resolution low-level feature maps from the early stages of the backbone to directly refine the low-resolution high-level feature map is a common practice of low-resolution feature map upsampling.
%
However, the representation power of the low-level features is generally worse than high-level features,
thus introducing ``noise" to the upsampling refinement.
%
To address this issue, we proposed High-level Feature Guided Decoder (HFGD), which uses isolated high-level features to guide low-level features and upsampling process.
%
Specifically, the guidance is realized through carefully designed stop gradient operations and class kernels. 
%
Now the class kernels co-evolve only with the high-level features and are reused in the upsampling head to guide the training process of the upsampling head.
%
HFGD is very efficient and effective that can also upsample the feature maps to a previously unseen output stride (OS) of 2 and still obtain accuracy gain.
%
HFGD demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets  (e.g., Pascal Context, COCOStuff164k, and Cityscapes) with small FLOPs.

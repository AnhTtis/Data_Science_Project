\caption{
Ablation studies on different HFGM settings on Pascal Context dataset.
HFGM effectively improves the accuracy, especially when it contains an axial attention (AA) layer since AA can effectively back-propagate the guidance signal from the good high-level features (i.e. output of CAE) to all spatial locations, resulting in more accurate upsampled feature representations.

    "abstract": "In canonical single-field inflation, the production of primordial black holes (PBH) requires a transient violation of the slow-roll condition. The transient ultra slow-roll inflation is an example of such scenario, and more generally, one can consider the transient constant-roll inflation. We investigate the squeezed bispectrum in the transient constant-roll inflation, and find that the Maldacena's consistency relation holds for a sufficiently long-wavelength mode, whereas it is violated for modes around the peak scale for the non-attractor case. We also demonstrate how the one-loop corrections are modified compared to the case of the transient ultra slow-roll inflation, focusing on representative one-loop terms orgiginating from a time derivative of the second slow-roll parameter in the cubic action. We find that the perturbativity requirement on those terms does not rule out the production of PBH from the transient constant-roll inflation. Therefore, it is a simple counterexample of the recently claimed no-go theorem of PBH production from single-field inflation.",

    "abstract": "We propose a new type of quantum statistics, which we call inclusion statistics, in which particles tend to coalesce more than ordinary bosons. Inclusion statistics is defined in analogy with exclusion statistics, in which statistical exclusion is stronger than in Fermi statistics, but now extrapolating beyond Bose statistics, resulting in statistical inclusion. A consequence of inclusion statistics is that the lowest space dimension in which particles can condense in the absence of potentials is $d=2$, unlike $d=3$ for the usual Bose-Einstein condensation. This reduction in the dimension happens for any inclusion stronger than bosons, and the critical temperature increases with stronger inclusion. Possible physical realizations of inclusion statistics involving attractive interactions between bosons may be experimentally achievable.",

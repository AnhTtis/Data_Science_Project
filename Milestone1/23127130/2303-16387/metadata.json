    "abstract": "We prove that any region $Γ$ in a homogeneous $n$-dimensional and locally compact separable metric space, where $n\\geq 2$, cannot be irreducibly separated by a closed $(n-1)$-dimensional subset $C$ with the following property: $C$ is acyclic in dimension $n-1$ and there is a point $b\\in C\\capΓ$ having a local base $\\mathcal B_C^b$ in $C$ such that the boundary of each $U\\in\\mathcal B_C^b$ is acyclic in dimension $n-2$. The acyclicity means triviality of the corresponding Čech cohomology groups. This implies all known results concerning the separation of regions in homogeneous spaces.",

abstract={We propose a novel discrete method of constructing Gaussian Random Fields based on a combination of modified spectral representations, Fourier and Blob. The method is intended for Direct Numerical Simulations of the V-Langevin equations. The latter are stereotypical descriptions of anomalous stochastic transport in various physical systems. From an Eulerian perspective, our method is designed to exhibit improved convergence rates. From a Lagrangian perspective, our method offers a pertinent description of particle trajectories in turbulent velocity fields: the exact Lagrangian invariant laws are well reproduced. From a computational perspective, the computing time is reduced by a factor of two in comparison with Fourier-like or Blob-like methods and an order of magnitude in comparison with FFT algorithms.},

abstract="Gaussian (normal) distribution is a basic continuous probability distribution in statistics, it plays a substantial role in scientific and engineering problems that related to stochastic phenomena. This paper aims to review state-of-the-art of Gaussian random field generation methods, their applications in scientific and engineering issues of interest, and open-source software/packages for Gaussian random field generation. To this end, first, we briefly introduce basic mathematical concepts and theories in the Gaussian random field, then seven commonly used Gaussian random field generation methods are systematically presented. The basic idea, mathematical framework of each generation method are introduced in detail and comparisons of these methods are summarized. Then, representative applications of the Gaussian random field in various areas, especially of engineering interest in recent two decades, are reviewed. For readers' convenience, four representative example codes are provided, and several relevant up-to-date open-source software and packages that freely available from the Internet are introduced.",

abstract = {We report an empirical study of the Ibovespa index of the São Paulo Stock Exchange in which we detect the existence of long-range correlations. To analyze our data, we introduce a rescaled variant of the usual detrended fluctuation analysis that allows us to obtain the Hurst exponent through a one-parameter fitting. We also compute a time-dependent Hurst exponent H(t) using 3-year moving time windows. In particular, we find that before the launch of the Collor Plan in 1990 the curve H(t) remains, in general, well above 12, while afterwards it stays close to 12. We thus argue that the structural reforms set off by the Collor Plan has lead to a more efficient stock market in Brazil. We also suggest that the time dependence of the Ibovespa Hurst exponent could be described in terms of a multifractional Brownian motion.}

    "abstract": "Machine learning requires exuberant amounts of data and computation. Also, models require equally excessive growth in the number of parameters. It is, therefore, sensible to look for technologies that reduce these demands on resources. Here, we propose an approach called guided transfer learning. Each weight and bias in the network has its own guiding parameter that indicates how much this parameter is allowed to change while learning a new task. Guiding parameters are learned during an initial scouting process. Guided transfer learning can result in a reduction in resources needed to train a network. In some applications, guided transfer learning enables the network to learn from a small amount of data. In other cases, a network with a smaller number of parameters can learn a task which otherwise only a larger network could learn. Guided transfer learning potentially has many applications when the amount of data, model size, or the availability of computational resources reach their limits.",

    "abstract": "This paper reports on a study of cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) using the mT5-XXL reranker on the NeuCLIR track of TREC 2022. Perhaps the biggest contribution of this study is the finding that despite the mT5 model being fine-tuned only on query-document pairs of the same language it proved to be viable for CLIR tasks, where query-document pairs are in different languages, even in the presence of suboptimal first-stage retrieval performance. The results of the study show outstanding performance across all tasks and languages, leading to a high number of winning positions. Finally, this study provides valuable insights into the use of mT5 in CLIR tasks and highlights its potential as a viable solution.

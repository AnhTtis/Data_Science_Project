    "abstract": "We observe that the comment of [1, arXiv:2302.07897] is consistent with [2] on key points: i) the microscopic mechanism of the experimentally observed teleportation is size winding and ii) the system thermalizes and scrambles at the time of teleportation. These properties are consistent with a gravitational interpretation of the teleportation dynamics, as opposed to the late-time dynamics. The objections of [1] concern counterfactual scenarios outside of the experimentally implemented protocol.",

	abstract = {Environment matting is a powerful technique for modelling the complex light-transport properties of real-world optically active elements: transparent, refractive and reﬂective objects. Zongker et al [1999] and Chuang et al [2000] show how environment mattes can be computed for real objects under carefully controlled laboratory conditions. However, for many objects of interest, such calibration is difﬁcult to arrange. For example, we might wish to determine the distortion caused by ﬁlming through an ancient window where the glass has ﬂowed; we may have access only to archive footage; or we might simply want a more convenient means of acquiring the matte.},

We impose no restrictions on material properties of the objects in the captured scene and exploit scene characteristics (e.g. material properties and self-shadowing) to minimize recording time and to bound the error. Using a CRT monitor, wavelet patterns are emitted onto the scene in order of importance to efficiently construct the environment matte. This order of importance is obtained by means of a feedback loop that takes advantage of the knowledge learned from previously recorded photographs. Once the recording process is finished, new backdrops can be efficiently placed behind the scene.},

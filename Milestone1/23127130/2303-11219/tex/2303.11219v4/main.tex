\begin{abstract}

    We present a novel method called NeTO, for capturing the 3D geometry of solid transparent objects from 2D images via volume rendering. 
    Reconstructing transparent objects is a very challenging task, which is ill-suited for general-purpose reconstruction techniques due to the specular light transport phenomena.
    Although existing refraction-tracing-based methods, designed especially for this task, achieve impressive results, they still suffer from unstable optimization and loss of fine details since the explicit surface representation they adopted is difficult to be optimized, and the self-occlusion problem is ignored for refraction-tracing.
    In this paper, we propose to leverage implicit Signed Distance Function (SDF) as surface representation and optimize the SDF field via volume rendering with a self-occlusion aware refractive ray tracing. 
    The implicit representation enables our method to be capable of reconstructing high-quality reconstruction even with a limited set of views, and the self-occlusion aware strategy makes it possible for our method to accurately reconstruct the self-occluded regions. 
    Experiments show that our method achieves faithful reconstruction results and outperforms prior works by a large margin.

% %%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
% \begin{abstract}
%     We present a novel method, called NeTO, to high-quality reconstruct the neural surface of the transparent object according to the ray-pixel correspondence. 
%     Many previous works only consider a single surface intersection point for each ray, resulting in gradients that only exist at this single point, and backpropagation needs to be more efficient.\;Meanwhile, current methods struggle to reconstruct high-quality 3D geometry of transparent objects in the case of depth-varying regions and sparse views.\;To solve the above issues, we propose to use a multi-layer perception network implicitly representing the transparent object geometry, and leverage volume rendering to simulate the tracing of refractive ray paths.\;During reconstructing, we learn neural SDF representation by ray-pixel correspondences while ensuring silhouette consistency. To speed up the quality and process of detail reconstruction, we use a ray sampling map to get enough attention to detail regions. We conduct quantitative and qualitative experiments. The experimental results validate that our reconstruction is more accurate and complete than state-of-the-art methods in sparse and dense views.

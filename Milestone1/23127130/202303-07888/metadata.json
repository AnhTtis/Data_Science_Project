    "abstract": "Target-to-user (T2U) association is a prerequisite to fully exploit the\npotential of the sensing function in communication-centric integrated sensing\nand communication (ISAC) systems, e.g., for beam and blockage management. This\nletter proposes to purposely mount a RIS on the roof of the vehicular user\nequipment (VUE), which can serve as an intentional back-reflector towards the\nbase station. By controlling the reflection pattern over time, it is possible\nto transmit information to the sensing system, i.e., back-reflection as bit 1,\nno back-reflection as bit 0. The VUEs are configured to back-reflect a Hadamard\ncode sequence, which enables T2U association. The numerical results confirm the\nvalidity of our proposal.",

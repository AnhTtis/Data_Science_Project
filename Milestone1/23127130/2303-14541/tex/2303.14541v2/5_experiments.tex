We demonstrate the effectiveness of \OURS{} for unsupervised class-agnostic 3D instance segmentation on challenging real-world 3D scan datasets containing a large diversity of objects and significant clutter.
We train our method and all learned baselines on ScanNet~\cite{dai2017scannet}, using the official train split.
Note that no semantic annotation data is used for training, only the RGB-D reconstructions.
Additionally, we show that our approach trained on ScanNet data can effectively transfer to class-agnostic 3D instance segmentation on ARKitScenes~\cite{dehghan2021arkitscenes} data.

\vspace{-0.3cm}
\paragraph{Datasets.}
We train and evaluate \OURS{} on RGB-D scan data from ScanNet~\cite{dai2017scannet}, using the official train split.
We use the raw RGB images, and registered camera poses for training our approach, while the semantic annotations are used only for evaluation.
We use the official ScanNet train split for both the pre-trained 3D features from \cite{hou2021exploring} and our self-training iterations.
%
We additionally evaluate our method on ARKitScenes~\cite{dehghan2021arkitscenes}, on an 884/120 train/test split of indoor LIDAR scans. 
For ARKitScenes, we use 3D pre-trained features from ScanNet, followed by pseudo mask generation and self-training on the ARKitScenes train scenes.
We convert the LIDAR scan data to meshes with Poisson Surface Reconstruction~\cite{kazhdan2006poisson,kazhdan2013screened} prior to our graph coarsening.
Note that all baselines using learned features are trained on the same ScanNet data as ours.

\vspace{-0.3cm}
\paragraph{Evaluation metrics.}
We evaluate class-agnostic 3D instance segmentation performance with the widely-used Average Precision score on the full-resolution mesh vertices. Following the strategy of the supervised benchmark \cite{dai2017scannet} we report scores at IoU scores of 25\% and 50\% (AP@25, AP@50) and averaged over all overlaps between [50\% and 95\%] at 5\% steps (AP). 
Note that since predictions are class agnostic, all methods evaluate only instance mask AP values without considering any semantic class labels.
For ScanNet, we evaluate against ground truth instance masks from the established 20-class benchmark.
Since ARKitScenes does not contain any ground truth instance mask annotations, we evaluate all methods qualitatively.

We evaluate our approach in comparison to state-of-the-art traditional clustering methods HDBSCAN~\cite{mcinnes2017accelerated_hdbscan} and Felzenszwalb's algorithm~\cite{felzenszwalb2004efficient}, in addition to the unsupervised approach of Nunes et. al.~\cite{nunes2022unsupervised} leveraging learned feature clustering and refinement.
All baselines are provided with input mesh vertices, colors, and normals, while our approach and Nunes et. al. also operate on sparse voxel scene representations.
Table~\ref{tab:scannet_results} and Figure~\ref{fig:full_results} show comparisons on ScanNet data; our \OURS{} approach improves significantly over state of the art by effectively leveraging signal from self-supervised 3D features to guide our model through self-training.
Note that since Nunes et. al. has been designed for outdoor applications, even while leveraging ScanNet-trained features, it uses ground removal and relies on physical object separation, making segmentation difficult in cluttered scenes.

Additionally, we demonstrate the importance of reasoning in 3D, and compare with a state-of-the-art unsupervised 2D instance segmentation approach CutLER~\cite{wang2023cut} run on the RGB frames of the scans, and projected to 3D using the corresponding camera poses.
Here, the difficulty lies in resolving view inconsistencies, occlusions, and lack of knowledge of geometric structure resulting in poor 3D segmentation performance despite plausible 2D proposals.

\paragraph{Evaluation on other datasets}
We quantitatively evaluate \OURS{} on the Area\_5 of the S3DIS dataset \cite{armeni_s3dis} using only 3D features pretrained on \cite{dai2017scannet}. Comparison with 3D-only state-of-the-art can be seen in Table \ref{tab:s3dis_results_table}.

\end{table}

We additionally compare with state of the art on ARKitScenes~\cite{dehghan2021arkitscenes} data in Figure~\ref{fig:arkitscenes_results}. Here we show only qualitative results due to the absence of ground truth instance mask annotations. \OURS{} effectively produces cleaner, more accurate segmentations in these complex environments.

\paragraph{\OURS{} as data-efficient pretraining}
\OURS{} is able to learn powerful object properties and dense segmentation even in a fully unsupervised fashion. 
We demonstrate the potential of our strong learned features for downstream 3D instance segmentation with limited annotated data. 
We follow the setup introduced by CSC~\cite{hou2021exploring} with limited reconstructions available for downstream fine-tuning.
We show our method as a strong pretraining strategy in Figure~\ref{fig:limited_data}, notably outperforming both training from scratch as well as the state-of-the-art 3D pretraining of CSC. For more details we refer to our supplementary material.

\paragraph{What is the effect of multi-modal signal for pseudo mask generation?} 
We evaluate the effect self-supervised color and geometry signals for generating pseudo annotations in Table~\ref{tab:pseudo_performance}. 
We consider using only self-supervised geometric features (3D), only self-supervised color features (2D) that are projected to the 3D scans, and both together (both).
We find that the color and geometry provide complementary signals.
We also note that color features are only used for the initial pseudo mask generation, during self-training iterations and test time only 3D features were used.

\vspace{-0.3cm}
\paragraph{What is the effect of pseudo annotations?}
We also evaluate the effect of our pseudo mask generation in  Table \ref{tab:pseudo_performance} and Figure \ref{fig:freemask_vs_ncut}, in comparison to the 3D adaptation of the FreeMask~\cite{wang2022freesolo} approach operating on our geometric segments. 
FreeMask tends to estimate a larger but noisier set of initial pseudo masks, while our approach is focusing on a sparser set of more reliable pseudo masks and produces significantly better performance. 
The strong difference in performance can be explained by the nature of the samples. While a sparser set of examples can be extended with multiple iterations of self-training, noisy samples will propagate through the full pipeline, and thus directly degrade the final performance. Further details of our adaptations of the FreeMask 3D method can be found in our supplemental.

\paragraph{What is the impact of self-training?}
We observe that while self-training iterations are always improving the qualitative performance, their effective added information value is saturating after a limited number of cycles. We report on Table \ref{tab:self_train_iteration} through the first 4 steps, and observe a significant relative improvement in both modalities.

\paragraph{Limitations}
While \OURS{} offers a promising step towards unsupervised 3D instance segmentation, various limitations remain.
We rely on a mesh representation for graph coarsening, but believe this could be extended to alternative representations through neighborhood reasoning.
Additionally, our graph coarsening step may cause very small objects (e.g., pens, cell phones) to be missed in the pseudo annotation generation.
Finally, employing a fixed set of pseudo masks from the initial stage that are used through self-training could reinforce noisy predictions.

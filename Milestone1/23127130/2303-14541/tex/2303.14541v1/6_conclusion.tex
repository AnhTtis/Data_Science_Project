\section{Conclusion}
We introduced \OURS{}, a novel approach towards achieving fully-unsupervised 3D instance segmentation in cluttered indoor scenes. 
Our approach effectively combined low-level geometric properties to regularize multi-modal self-supervised deep features for initial pseudo mask extraction, and our self-training notably improved performance by refining these proposals to a more complete, dense set of instances.
As 3D instance segmentation is a crucial aspect of 3D scene understanding, \OURS{}'s  ability to achieve this without requiring any manual annotations opens up new possibilities for 3D semantic understanding.

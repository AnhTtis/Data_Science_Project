\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

\gamename is a multi-agent research platform to study natural language instruction in collaborative, embodied environments. 
A core objective of \gamename is to enable scaleable studies where human agents interact with learned models, potentially over long periods of time. 
\gamename is designed to be easy to use and customize, with emphasis on accessibility for researchers with limited game development experience. 
It is designed from the ground up for machine learning, and includes a headless fast Python client API to support learning processes and to deploy learned models to interact with human users.

\section*{Ethical Considerations}\label{sec:ethics}

\gamename is a research environment. 
The focus on a relatively restricted 3D environment reduces the potential for ethical risks. 
Our use of \gamename has received exemption status by our institution's IRB office. We recommend that researchers using \gamename obtain IRB approval or exemption for their studies from their institution's IRB office, or an equivalent body. 
More broadly, systems that learn from interaction with users raise risks of adopting negative behavior patterns from their users. 
This is especially an issue in certain contexts, such as open ended conversational interfaces or chatbots. 
This is an important direction for future work. \gamename can be used to study such adversarial usage scenarios in a relatively safe way.

    "abstract": "CB2 is a multi-agent platform to study collaborative natural language interaction in a grounded task-oriented scenario. It includes a 3D game environment, a backend server designed to serve trained models to human agents, and various tools and processes to enable scalable studies. We deploy CB2 at https://cb2.ai as a system demonstration with a learned instruction following model.",

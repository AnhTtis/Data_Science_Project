The high performance computing (HPC) and architecture community is beginning to design new solutions to take advantage of neutral-atom quantum architectures and overcome its unique challenges.We propose Geyser, the first work to take advantage of the multi-qubit gates natively supported by neutral-atom quantum computers by appropriately mapping quantum circuits to three-qubit-friendly physical arrangement of qubits. Then, Geyser creates multiple logical blocks in the quantum circuit to exploit quantum parallelism and reduce the number of pulses needed to realize physical gates. These circuit blocks elegantly enable Geyser to compose equivalent circuits with three-qubit gates, even when the original program does not have any multi-qubit gates. Our evaluation results show Geyser reduces the number of operation pulses by 25\%-90\% and improves the algorithm's output fidelity by 25\%-60\% points across different algorithms.},

A fundamental challenge is to build a high-fidelity processor capable of running quantum algorithms in an exponentially large computational space. Here we report the use of a processor with programmable superconducting qubits2–7 to create quantum states on 53 qubits, corresponding to a computational state-space of dimension 253 (about 1016). Measurements from repeated experiments sample the resulting probability distribution, which we verify using classical simulations. Our Sycamore processor takes about 200 seconds to sample one instance of a quantum circuit a million times—our benchmarks currently indicate that the equivalent task for a state-of-the-art classical supercomputer would take approximately 10,000 years. This dramatic increase in speed compared to all known classical algorithms is an experimental realization of quantum supremacy8–14 for this specific computational task, heralding a much-anticipated computing paradigm.},

However, the number of state amplitudes required for full simulation increases exponentially with the number of qubits. In this study, we leverage data compression to reduce memory requirements, trading computation time and fidelity for memory space. Specifically, we develop a hybrid solution by combining the lossless compression and our tailored lossy compression method with adaptive error bounds at each timestep of the simulation. Our approach optimizes for compression speed and makes sure that errors due to lossy compression are uncorrelated, an important property for comparing simulation output with physical machines. Experiments show that our approach reduces the memory requirement of simulating the 61-qubit Grover's search algorithm from 32 exabytes to 768 terabytes of memory on Argonne's Theta supercomputer using 4,096 nodes. The results suggest that our techniques can increase the simulation size by 2 16 qubits for general quantum circuits.},

            Controlling and programming quantum devices to process quantum information by the unit of quantum dit, i.e., qudit, provides the possibilities for noise-resilient quantum communications, delicate quantum molecular simulations, and efficient quantum computations, showing great potential to enhance the capabilities of qubit-based quantum technologies. Here, we report a programmable qudit-based quantum processor in silicon-photonic integrated circuits and demonstrate its enhancement of quantum computational parallelism. The processor monolithically integrates all the key functionalities and capabilities of initialisation, manipulation, and measurement of the two quantum quart (ququart) states and multi-value quantum-controlled logic gates with high-level fidelities. By reprogramming the configuration of the processor, we implemented the most basic quantum Fourier transform algorithms, all in quaternary, to benchmark the enhancement of quantum parallelism using qudits, which include generalised Deutsch-Jozsa and Bernstein-Vazirani algorithms, quaternary phase estimation and fast factorization algorithms. The monolithic integration and high programmability have allowed the implementations of more than one million high-fidelity preparations, operations and projections of qudit states in the processor. Our work shows an integrated photonic quantum technology for qudit-based quantum computing with enhanced capacity, accuracy, and efficiency, which could lead to the acceleration of building a large-scale quantum computer.},

This review provides an overview of qudit-based quantum computing covering a variety of topics ranging from circuit building, algorithm design, to experimental methods. We first discuss the qudit gate universality and a variety of qudit gates including the pi/8 gate, the SWAP gate, and the multi-level controlled-gate. We then present the qudit version of several representative quantum algorithms including the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, the quantum Fourier transform, and the phase estimation algorithm. Finally we discuss various physical realizations for qudit computation such as the photonic platform, iron trap, and nuclear magnetic resonance.},

	abstract = {We consider the optimal control problem of determining electromagnetic pulses for implementing logical gates in a closed quantum system, where the Hamiltonian models the dynamics of coupled superconducting qudits. The quantum state is governed by Schr¨odinger’s equation, which we formulate in terms of the real and imaginary parts of the state vector and solve by the St¨ormerVerlet scheme, which is a symplectic partitioned Runge-Kutta method. A novel parameterization of the control functions based on B-splines with carrier waves is introduced. The carrier waves are used to trigger the resonant frequencies in the system Hamiltonian, and the B-spline functions specify their amplitude and phase. This approach allows the number of control parameters to be independent of, and signiﬁcantly smaller than, the number of time steps for integrating Schro¨dinger’s equation.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09148},
	abstract = {This paper presents a framework for solving the pure-state preparation problem using numerical optimal control. As an example, we consider the case where a number of qubits are dispersively coupled to a readout cavity. We model open system quantum dynamics using the Markovian Lindblad master equation, driven by external control pulses. The main result of this paper develops a basis of density matrices (a parameterization) where each basis element is a density matrix itself. Utilizing a specific objective function, we show how an ensemble of the basis elements can be used as a single initial state throughout the optimization process - independent of the system dimension. We apply the general framework to the specific application of ground-state reset of one and two qubits coupled to a readout cavity.},

	abstract = {This paper considers the optimal control problem for realizing logical gates in a closed quantum system. The quantum state is governed by Schr¨odinger’s equation, which we formulate as a time-dependent Hamiltonian system in terms of the real and imaginary parts of the state vector. The system is discretized with the St¨ormer-Verlet scheme, which is a symplectic partitioned Runge-Kutta method. Our main theoretical contribution is the derivation of a compatible time-discretization of the adjoint state equation, such that the gradient of the discrete objective function can be calculated exactly, at a computational cost of solving two Schr¨odinger systems, independently of the number of parameters in the control functions.},

	abstract = {Using a set of general methods developed by Krotov [A. I. Konnov and V. A. Krotov, Automation and Remote Control 60, 1427 (1999)], we extend the capabilities of optimal control theory to the nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE). The paper begins with a general review of the Krotov approach to optimization. Although the linearized version of the method is sufficient for the linear Schrödinger equation, the full flexibility of the general method is required for treatment of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation. Formal equations for the optimization of the NLSE, as well as a concrete algorithm are presented. As an illustration, we consider a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) initially at rest in a harmonic trap. A phase develops across the BEC when an optical lattice potential is turned on. The goal is to counter this effect and keep the phase flat by adjusting the trap strength. The problem is formulated in the language of optimal control theory (OCT) and solved using the above methodology. To our knowledge, this is the first rigorous application of OCT to the nonlinear Schrödinger equation, a capability that is bound to have numerous other applications.},

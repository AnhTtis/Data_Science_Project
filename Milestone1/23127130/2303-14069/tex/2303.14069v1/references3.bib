	abstract = {We consider the optimal control problem of determining electromagnetic pulses for implementing logical gates in a closed quantum system, where the Hamiltonian models the dynamics of coupled superconducting qudits. The quantum state is governed by Schr¨odinger’s equation, which we formulate in terms of the real and imaginary parts of the state vector and solve by the St¨ormerVerlet scheme, which is a symplectic partitioned Runge-Kutta method. A novel parameterization of the control functions based on B-splines with carrier waves is introduced. The carrier waves are used to trigger the resonant frequencies in the system Hamiltonian, and the B-spline functions specify their amplitude and phase. This approach allows the number of control parameters to be independent of, and signiﬁcantly smaller than, the number of time steps for integrating Schro¨dinger’s equation.},

Krotov, Automation and Remote Control 60, 1427 (1999)], we extend the capabilities of optimal control theory to the nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE). The paper begins with a general review of the Krotov approach to optimization. Although the linearized version of the method is sufficient for the linear Schrödinger equation, the full flexibility of the general method is required for treatment of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation. Formal equations for the optimization of the NLSE, as well as a concrete algorithm are presented. As an illustration, we consider a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) initially at rest in a harmonic trap. A phase develops across the BEC when an optical lattice potential is turned on. The goal is to counter this effect and keep the phase flat by adjusting the trap strength. The problem is formulated in the language of optimal control theory (OCT) and solved using the above methodology. To our knowledge, this is the first rigorous application of OCT to the nonlinear Schrödinger equation, a capability that is bound to have numerous other applications.},

Quantum optimal control methods have proven effective in experimentally realizing high-fidelity gates, but they require exquisite calibration to be performant. We apply robust trajectory optimization techniques to suppress gate errors arising from system parameter uncertainty. We propose a derivative-based approach that maintains computational efficiency by using forward-mode differentiation. Additionally, the effect of depolarization on a gate is typically modeled by integrating the Lindblad master equation, which is computationally expensive. We employ a computationally efficient model and utilize time-optimal control to achieve high-fidelity gates in the presence of depolarization. We apply these techniques to a fluxonium qubit and suppress simulated gate errors due to parameter uncertainty below \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-7\}\$ for static parameter deviations on the order of \$1{\textbackslash}\%\$.},

A natural choice to implement Shor's algorithm on a ternary quantum computer is to translate the entire arithmetic into a ternary form. However, it is also possible to emulate the standard binary version of the algorithm by encoding each qubit in a three-level system. We compare the two approaches and analyze the complexity of implementing Shor's period-finding function in the two models. We also highlight the fact that the cost of achieving universality through magic states in MTQC architecture is asymptotically lower than in generic ternary case.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.1512.03824},
	abstract = {Qutrit (or ternary) structures arise naturally in many quantum systems, particularly in certain non-abelian anyon systems. We present efficient circuits for ternary reversible and quantum arithmetics. Our main result is the derivation of circuits for two families of ternary quantum adders, namely ripple carry adders and carry look-ahead adders. The main difference to the binary case is the more complicated form of the ternary carry, which leads to higher resource counts for implementations over a universal ternary gate set. Our ternary ripple adder circuit has a circuit depth of \$O(n)\$ and uses only \$1\$ ancilla, making it more efficient in both, circuit depth and width than previous constructions. Our ternary carry lookahead circuit has a circuit depth of only \$O({\textbackslash}log{\textbackslash},n)\$, while using with \$O(n)\$ ancillas. Our approach works on two levels of abstraction: at the first level, descriptions of arithmetic circuits are given in terms of gates sequences that use various types of non-Clifford reflections. At the second level, we break down these reflections further by deriving them either from the two-qutrit Clifford gates and the non-Clifford gate \$C(X): {\textbar}i,j{\textbackslash}rangle {\textbackslash}mapsto {\textbar}i, j + {\textbackslash}delta\_\{i,2\} {\textbackslash}mod 3{\textbackslash}rangle\$ or from the two-qutrit Clifford gates and the non-Clifford gate \$P\_9={\textbackslash}mbox\{diag\}(e{\textasciicircum}\{-2 {\textbackslash}pi {\textbackslash}, i/9\},1,e{\textasciicircum}\{2 {\textbackslash}pi {\textbackslash}, i/9\})\$. The two choices of elementary gate sets correspond to two possible mappings onto two different prospective quantum computing architectures which we call the metaplectic and the supermetaplectic basis, respectively. Finally, we develop a method to factor diagonal unitaries using multi-variate polynomial over the ternary finite field which allows to characterize classes of gates that can be implemented exactly over the supermetaplectic basis.},

	abstract = {The theory of quantum information provides a common language which links disciplines ranging from cosmology to condensed-matter physics. For example, the delocalization of quantum information in strongly-interacting many-body systems, known as quantum information scrambling, has recently begun to unite our understanding of black hole dynamics, transport in exotic non-Fermi liquids, and many-body analogs of quantum chaos. To date, verified experimental implementations of scrambling have dealt only with systems comprised of two-level qubits. Higher-dimensional quantum systems, however, may exhibit different scrambling modalities and are predicted to saturate conjectured speed limits on the rate of quantum information scrambling. We take the first steps toward accessing such phenomena, by realizing a quantum processor based on superconducting qutrits (three-level quantum systems). We implement two-qutrit scrambling operations and embed them in a five-qutrit teleportation algorithm to directly measure the associated out of-time-ordered correlation functions. Measured teleportation fidelities, Favg = 0.568 +- 0001, confirm the occurrence of scrambling even in the presence of experimental imperfections. Our teleportation algorithm, which connects to recent proposals for studying traversable wormholes in the laboratory, demonstrates how quantum information processing technology based on higher dimensional systems can exploit a larger and more connected state space to achieve the resource efficient encoding of complex quantum circuits.},

            Controlling and programming quantum devices to process quantum information by the unit of quantum dit, i.e., qudit, provides the possibilities for noise-resilient quantum communications, delicate quantum molecular simulations, and efficient quantum computations, showing great potential to enhance the capabilities of qubit-based quantum technologies. Here, we report a programmable qudit-based quantum processor in silicon-photonic integrated circuits and demonstrate its enhancement of quantum computational parallelism. The processor monolithically integrates all the key functionalities and capabilities of initialisation, manipulation, and measurement of the two quantum quart (ququart) states and multi-value quantum-controlled logic gates with high-level fidelities. By reprogramming the configuration of the processor, we implemented the most basic quantum Fourier transform algorithms, all in quaternary, to benchmark the enhancement of quantum parallelism using qudits, which include generalised Deutsch-Jozsa and Bernstein-Vazirani algorithms, quaternary phase estimation and fast factorization algorithms. The monolithic integration and high programmability have allowed the implementations of more than one million high-fidelity preparations, operations and projections of qudit states in the processor. Our work shows an integrated photonic quantum technology for qudit-based quantum computing with enhanced capacity, accuracy, and efficiency, which could lead to the acceleration of building a large-scale quantum computer.},

In order to find someone's phone number with a 50\% probability, any classical algorithm (whether deterministic or probabilistic) will need to look at a minimum of N/2 names. Quantum mechanical systems can be in a superposition of states and simultaneously examine multiple names. By properly adjusting the phases of various operations, successful computations reinforce each other while others interfere randomly. As a result, the desired phone number can be obtained in only O(sqrt(N)) steps. The algorithm is within a small constant factor of the fastest possible quantum mechanical algorithm.},

Yet, the underlying quantum hardware consists of information carriers that are not necessarily binary, but typically exhibit a rich multilevel structure, which is artificially restricted to two dimensions. A wide range of applications from quantum chemistry to quantum simulation, on the other hand, would benefit from access to higher-dimensional Hilbert spaces, which conventional quantum computers can only emulate. Here we demonstrate a universal qudit quantum processor using trapped ions with a local Hilbert space dimension of up to 7. With a performance similar to qubit quantum processors, this approach enables native simulation of high-dimensional quantum systems, as well as more efficient implementation of qubit-based algorithms.},

In this work, we break this abstraction and synthesize short-duration control pulses for gates on generalized d-state qudits. We present Incremental Pulse Re-seeding, a practical scheme to guide optimal control software to the lowest-duration pulse by iteratively seeding the optimizer with previous results. We find a near-linear relationship between Hilbert space dimension and gate duration through explicit pulse optimization for one- and two-qudit gates on transmons. Our results suggest that qudit operations are much more efficient than previously expected in the practical regime of interest and have the potential to significantly increase the computational power of current hardware.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2109.00558},
	abstract = {Quantum computation is conventionally performed using quantum operations acting on two-level quantum bits, or qubits. Qubits in modern quantum computers suffer from inevitable detrimental interactions with the environment that cause errors during computation, with multi-qubit operations often being a primary limitation. Most quantum devices naturally have multiple accessible energy levels beyond the lowest two traditionally used to define a qubit. Qudits offer a larger state space to store and process quantum information, reducing complexity of quantum circuits and improving efficiency of quantum algorithms. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a ternary decomposition of a multi-qubit operation on cloud-enabled fixed-frequency superconducting transmons. Specifically, we realize an order-preserving Toffoli gate consisting of four two-transmon operations, whereas the optimal order-preserving binary decomposition uses eight {\textbackslash}texttt\{CNOT\}s on a linear transmon topology. Both decompositions are benchmarked via truth table fidelity where the ternary approach outperforms on most sets of transmons on {\textbackslash}texttt\{ibmq{\textbackslash}\_jakarta\}, and is further benchmarked via quantum process tomography on one set of transmons to achieve an average gate fidelity of 78.00{\textbackslash}\% \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 1.93{\textbackslash}\%.},

The increased ratio of the Josephson to charging energy results in an exponential suppression of the transmon’s sensitivity to 1/f charge noise. This has been observed experimentally and yields homogeneous broadening, negligible pure dephasing, and long coherence times of up to 3 µs. Anharmonicity of the energy spectrum is required for qubit operation, and has been proven to be sufﬁcient in transmon devices. Transmons have been implemented in a wide array of experiments, demonstrating consistent and reproducible results in very good agreement with theory.},

	abstract = {Compared to widely-used superconducting qubits, neutral-atom quantum computing technology promises potentially better scalability and flexible arrangement of qubits to allow higher operation parallelism and more relaxed cooling requirements. The high performance computing (HPC) and architecture community is beginning to design new solutions to take advantage of neutral-atom quantum architectures and overcome its unique challenges.We propose Geyser, the first work to take advantage of the multi-qubit gates natively supported by neutral-atom quantum computers by appropriately mapping quantum circuits to three-qubit-friendly physical arrangement of qubits. Then, Geyser creates multiple logical blocks in the quantum circuit to exploit quantum parallelism and reduce the number of pulses needed to realize physical gates. These circuit blocks elegantly enable Geyser to compose equivalent circuits with three-qubit gates, even when the original program does not have any multi-qubit gates. Our evaluation results show Geyser reduces the number of operation pulses by 25\%-90\% and improves the algorithm's output fidelity by 25\%-60\% points across different algorithms.},

A fundamental challenge is to build a high-fidelity processor capable of running quantum algorithms in an exponentially large computational space. Here we report the use of a processor with programmable superconducting qubits2–7 to create quantum states on 53 qubits, corresponding to a computational state-space of dimension 253 (about 1016). Measurements from repeated experiments sample the resulting probability distribution, which we verify using classical simulations. Our Sycamore processor takes about 200 seconds to sample one instance of a quantum circuit a million times—our benchmarks currently indicate that the equivalent task for a state-of-the-art classical supercomputer would take approximately 10,000 years. This dramatic increase in speed compared to all known classical algorithms is an experimental realization of quantum supremacy8–14 for this specific computational task, heralding a much-anticipated computing paradigm.},

	abstract = {Quantum circuit simulations are critical for evaluating quantum algorithms and machines. However, the number of state amplitudes required for full simulation increases exponentially with the number of qubits. In this study, we leverage data compression to reduce memory requirements, trading computation time and fidelity for memory space. Specifically, we develop a hybrid solution by combining the lossless compression and our tailored lossy compression method with adaptive error bounds at each timestep of the simulation. Our approach optimizes for compression speed and makes sure that errors due to lossy compression are uncorrelated, an important property for comparing simulation output with physical machines. Experiments show that our approach reduces the memory requirement of simulating the 61-qubit Grover's search algorithm from 32 exabytes to 768 terabytes of memory on Argonne's Theta supercomputer using 4,096 nodes. The results suggest that our techniques can increase the simulation size by 2 16 qubits for general quantum circuits.},

            Controlling and programming quantum devices to process quantum information by the unit of quantum dit, i.e., qudit, provides the possibilities for noise-resilient quantum communications, delicate quantum molecular simulations, and efficient quantum computations, showing great potential to enhance the capabilities of qubit-based quantum technologies. Here, we report a programmable qudit-based quantum processor in silicon-photonic integrated circuits and demonstrate its enhancement of quantum computational parallelism. The processor monolithically integrates all the key functionalities and capabilities of initialisation, manipulation, and measurement of the two quantum quart (ququart) states and multi-value quantum-controlled logic gates with high-level fidelities. By reprogramming the configuration of the processor, we implemented the most basic quantum Fourier transform algorithms, all in quaternary, to benchmark the enhancement of quantum parallelism using qudits, which include generalised Deutsch-Jozsa and Bernstein-Vazirani algorithms, quaternary phase estimation and fast factorization algorithms. The monolithic integration and high programmability have allowed the implementations of more than one million high-fidelity preparations, operations and projections of qudit states in the processor. Our work shows an integrated photonic quantum technology for qudit-based quantum computing with enhanced capacity, accuracy, and efficiency, which could lead to the acceleration of building a large-scale quantum computer.},

This review provides an overview of qudit-based quantum computing covering a variety of topics ranging from circuit building, algorithm design, to experimental methods. We first discuss the qudit gate universality and a variety of qudit gates including the pi/8 gate, the SWAP gate, and the multi-level controlled-gate. We then present the qudit version of several representative quantum algorithms including the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, the quantum Fourier transform, and the phase estimation algorithm. Finally we discuss various physical realizations for qudit computation such as the photonic platform, iron trap, and nuclear magnetic resonance.},

Krotov, Automation and Remote Control 60, 1427 (1999)], we extend the capabilities of optimal control theory to the nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE). The paper begins with a general review of the Krotov approach to optimization. Although the linearized version of the method is sufficient for the linear Schrödinger equation, the full flexibility of the general method is required for treatment of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation. Formal equations for the optimization of the NLSE, as well as a concrete algorithm are presented. As an illustration, we consider a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) initially at rest in a harmonic trap. A phase develops across the BEC when an optical lattice potential is turned on. The goal is to counter this effect and keep the phase flat by adjusting the trap strength. The problem is formulated in the language of optimal control theory (OCT) and solved using the above methodology. To our knowledge, this is the first rigorous application of OCT to the nonlinear Schrödinger equation, a capability that is bound to have numerous other applications.},

	abstract = {Quantum computation is conventionally performed using quantum operations acting on two-level quantum bits, or qubits. Qubits in modern quantum computers suffer from inevitable detrimental interactions with the environment that cause errors during computation, with multi-qubit operations often being a primary limitation. Most quantum devices naturally have multiple accessible energy levels beyond the lowest two traditionally used to define a qubit. Qudits offer a larger state space to store and process quantum information, reducing complexity of quantum circuits and improving efficiency of quantum algorithms. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a ternary decomposition of a multi-qubit operation on cloud-enabled fixed-frequency superconducting transmons. Specifically, we realize an order-preserving Toffoli gate consisting of four two-transmon operations, whereas the optimal order-preserving binary decomposition uses eight {\textbackslash}texttt\{CNOT\}s on a linear transmon topology. Both decompositions are benchmarked via truth table fidelity where the ternary approach outperforms on most sets of transmons on {\textbackslash}texttt\{ibmq{\textbackslash}\_jakarta\}, and is further benchmarked via quantum process tomography on one set of transmons to achieve an average gate fidelity of 78.00{\textbackslash}\% \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 1.93{\textbackslash}\%.},

A leading candidate is Farhi et al.'s Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm, which alternates between applying a cost-function-based Hamiltonian and a mixing Hamiltonian. Here, we extend this framework to allow alternation between more general families of operators. The essence of this extension, the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz, is the consideration of general parametrized families of unitaries rather than only those corresponding to the time-evolution under a fixed local Hamiltonian for a time specified by the parameter. This ansatz supports the representation of a larger, and potentially more useful, set of states than the original formulation, with potential long-term impact on a broad array of application areas. For cases that call for mixing only within a desired subspace, refocusing on unitaries rather than Hamiltonians enables more efficiently implementable mixers than was possible in the original framework. Such mixers are particularly useful for optimization problems with hard constraints that must always be satisfied, defining a feasible subspace, and soft constraints whose violation we wish to minimize. More efficient implementation enables earlier experimental exploration of an alternating operator approach to a wide variety of approximate optimization, exact optimization, and sampling problems. Here, we introduce the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz, lay out design criteria for mixing operators, detail mappings for eight problems, and provide brief descriptions of mappings for diverse problems.},

These gates play a central role in many proposed constructions of quantum computational networks. We derive upper and lower bounds on the exact number of elementary gates required to build up a variety of two-and three-bit quantum gates, the asymptotic number required for \$n\$-bit Deutsch-Toffoli gates, and make some observations about the number required for arbitrary \$n\$-bit unitary operations.},

	abstract = {Quantum computation is conventionally performed using quantum operations acting on two-level quantum bits, or qubits. Qubits in modern quantum computers suffer from inevitable detrimental interactions with the environment that cause errors during computation, with multi-qubit operations often being a primary limitation. Most quantum devices naturally have multiple accessible energy levels beyond the lowest two traditionally used to define a qubit. Qudits offer a larger state space to store and process quantum information, reducing complexity of quantum circuits and improving efficiency of quantum algorithms. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a ternary decomposition of a multi-qubit operation on cloud-enabled fixed-frequency superconducting transmons. Specifically, we realize an order-preserving Toffoli gate consisting of four two-transmon operations, whereas the optimal order-preserving binary decomposition uses eight {\textbackslash}textbackslashtexttt\{CNOT\}s on a linear transmon topology. Both decompositions are benchmarked via truth table fidelity where the ternary approach outperforms on most sets of transmons on {\textbackslash}textbackslashtexttt\{ibmq{\textbackslash}textbackslash\_jakarta\}, and is further benchmarked via quantum process tomography on one set of transmons to achieve an average gate fidelity of 78.00{\textbackslash}textbackslash\% \${\textbackslash}textbackslashpm\$ 1.93{\textbackslash}textbackslash\%.},

	abstract = {Ternary quantum information processing in superconducting devices poses a promising alternative to its more popular binary counterpart through larger, more connected computational spaces and proposed advantages in quantum simulation and error correction. Although generally operated as qubits, transmons have readily addressable higher levels, making them natural candidates for operation as quantum three-level systems (qutrits). Recent works in transmon devices have realized high fidelity single qutrit operation. Nonetheless, effectively engineering a high-fidelity two-qutrit entanglement remains a central challenge for realizing qutrit processing in a transmon device. In this work, we apply the differential AC Stark shift to implement a flexible, microwave-activated, and dynamic cross-Kerr entanglement between two fixed-frequency transmon qutrits, expanding on work performed for the \$ZZ\$ interaction with transmon qubits. We then use this interaction to engineer efficient, high-fidelity qutrit CZ\${\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}dag\$ and CZ gates, with estimated process fidelities of 97.3(1)\% and 95.2(3)\% respectively, a significant step forward for operating qutrits on a multi-transmon device.},

In principle, this approach is highly flexible, allowing full control over the qubits' Hilbert space without necessitating the development of specific control protocols for each application. However, current error rates on quantum hardware place harsh limits on the number of primitive gates that can be concatenated together (with compounding error rates) and remain viable. Here, we report our efforts at implementing a software-defined \$0{\textbackslash}leftrightarrow2\$ SWAP gate that does not rely on a primitive gate set and achieves an average gate fidelity of \$99.4{\textbackslash}\%\$. Our work represents an alternative, fully generalizable route towards achieving nontrivial quantum control through the use of optimal control techniques.

Unlike quantum optimal control, our approach is bootstrapped from existing gate calibrations and the resulting pulses are simple. Our techniques are applicable to any quantum computer and realizable on current devices. We validate our techniques with millions of experimental shots on IBM quantum computers, controlled via the OpenPulse control interface. For representative benchmarks, our pulse control techniques achieve both 1.6x lower error rates and 2x faster execution time, relative to standard gate-based compilation.

We realize an AQEC scheme, implemented with only two transmon qubits in a 2D scalable architecture, that actively corrects single-photon loss and passively suppresses low-frequency dephasing using six microwave drives. Compared to uncorrected encoding, factors of 2.0, 5.1, and 1.4 improvements are experimentally witnessed for the logical zero, one, and superposition states. Our results show the potential of implementing hardware-efficient AQEC to enhance the reliability of a transmon-based quantum information processor.},

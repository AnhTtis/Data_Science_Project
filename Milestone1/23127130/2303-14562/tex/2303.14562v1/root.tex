\begin{abstract}
This work proposes a robot task planning framework for retrieving a target object in a confined workspace among multiple stacked objects that obstruct the target. The robot can use prehensile picking and in-workspace placing actions.
%, i.e., it cannot access external buffers for the placement of obstructing objects.
The method assumes access to 3D models for the visible objects in the scene. The key contribution is in achieving desirable properties, i.e., to provide (a) safety, by avoiding collisions with sensed obstacles, objects, and occluded regions, and (b) resolution completeness ({$\tt RC$}) - or probabilistic completeness ({$\tt PC$}) depending on implementation - which indicates a solution will be eventually found (if it exists) as the resolution of algorithmic parameters increases. A heuristic variant of the basic {$\tt RC$} algorithm is also proposed to solve the task more efficiently while retaining the desirable properties. Simulation results compare using random picking and placing operations against the basic {$\tt RC$} algorithm that reasons about object dependency as well as its heuristic variant. The success rate is higher for the {$\tt RC$} approaches given the same amount of time. The heuristic variant is able to solve the problem even more efficiently than the basic approach. The integration of the $\tt RC$ algorithm with perception, where an RGB-D sensor detects the objects as they are being moved, enables real robot demonstrations of safely retrieving target objects from a cluttered shelf.

	Abstract = {We present an algorithm that seeks to find a set of diverse, short paths through a
               roadmap graph. The usefulness of a such a set is illustrated in robotic motion planning and
               routing applications wherein a precomputed roadmap of the environment is partially
               invalidated by some change, for example, relocation of obstacles or modification of the
               robot. Our algorithm employs the heuristic that configurations near each other are likely to
               be invalidated by the same change in the environment. To find short, diverse paths, the
               algorithm finds a detour that is the shortest path avoiding a selection of balls in the
               configuration space. Different collections of these balls, or simulated obstacles, yield
               different and diverse short paths. Paths may then be checked for validity as a cheap
               alternative to checking or reconstructing the entire roadmap. We describe a formal
               definition of path set diversity and several measures on which to evaluate our algorithm. We
               compare the speed and quality of our heuristic algorithm{\textquoteright}s results against
               an exact algorithm that computes the optimally shortest set of paths on the roadmap having a
               minimum diversity. We will show that, with a tolerable loss in path shortness, our algorithm
               produces equally diverse path sets orders of magnitude faster.},

@article{Hau14,
	Abstract = {This paper formulates a new minimum constraint
                 removal (MCR) motion planning problem in which the
                 objective is to remove the fewest geometric
                 constraints necessary to connect a start and goal
                 state with a free path. It describes a probabilistic
                 roadmap motion planner for MCR in continuous
                 configuration spaces that operates by constructing
                 increasingly refined roadmaps, and efficiently solves
                 discrete MCR problems on these networks. A number of
                 new theoretical results are given for discrete MCR,
                 including a proof that it is NP-hard by reduction from
                 SET-COVER. Two search algorithms are described that
                 perform well in practice. The motion planner is proven
                 to produce the optimal MCR with probability
                 approaching 1 as more time is spent, and its
                 convergence rate is improved with various efficient
                 sampling strategies. It is demonstrated on three
                 example applications: generating human-interpretable
                 excuses for failure, motion planning under
                 uncertainty, and rearranging movable obstacles.},

	Abstract = {While spatial sampling of points has already received much attention, the motion planning problem can also be viewed as a process which samples the function space of paths. We define a search space to be a set of candidate paths and consider the problem of designing a search space which is most likely to produce a solution given a probabilistic representation of all possible environments. We introduce the concept of relative completeness which is the prior probability, before the environment is specified, of producing a solution path in a bounded amount of computation. We show how this probability is related to the mutual separation of the set of paths searched. The problem of producing an optimal set can be related to the maximum k-facility dispersion problem which is known to be NP-hard. We propose a greedy algorithm for producing a good set of paths and demonstrate that it produces results with both low dispersion and high prior probability of success.},

@article{KroBek17,
	Abstract = {The typical objective in path planning is to find the
                  shortest feasible path. Many times, however, such paths may not be
                  available given constraints, such as movable obstacles. This
                  frequently happens in manipulation planning, where it may be
                  desirable to identify the minimum set of movable obstacles to be
                  cleared to manipulate a target object. This is a similar objective to
                  that of the Minimum Constraint Removal problem, which, however, does
                  not exhibit dynamic programming properties, i.e., subsets of optimum
                  solutions are not necessarily optimal. Thus, searching for MCR paths
                  is computationally expensive. Motivated by this challenge and related
                  work, this paper investigates approximations for computing MCR paths
                  in the context of manipulation planning.  The proposed framework
                  searches for MCR paths up to a certain length of solution in terms of
                  end-effector distance. This length can be defined as a multiple of
                  the shortest path length in the space when movable objects are
                  ignored. Given experimental evaluation on simulated manipulation
                  planning challenges, the bounded-length approximation provides a
                  desirable tradeoff between minimizing constraints, computational cost
                  and path length.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes a software infrastructure for developing controllers and planners for robotic systems, referred here as PRACSYS. At the core of the software is the abstraction of a dynamical system, which, given a control, propagates its state forward in time. The platform simplifies the development of new controllers and planners and provides an extensible framework that allows complex interactions between one or many controllers, as well as motion planners. For instance, it is possible to compose many control layers over a physical system, to define multi-agent controllers that operate over many systems, to easily switch between different underlying controllers, and plan over controllers to achieve feedback-based planning. Such capabilities are especially useful for the control of hybrid and cyber-physical systems, which are important in many applications. The software is complementary and builds on top of many existing open-source contributions. It allows the use of different libraries as plugins for various modules, such as collision checking, physics-based simulation, visualization, and planning. This paper describes the overall architecture, explains important features and provides use-cases that evaluate aspects of the infrastructure.},

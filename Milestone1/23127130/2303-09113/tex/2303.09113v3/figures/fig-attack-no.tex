    \caption{
        Honest chain growth when the adversary does not release blocks (either under no attack or under the private attack). Semi-transparent blocks have been announced (\ie, headers released) but were not yet downloaded by honest nodes.
        (a) A new block is announced at height $2$. This block is not yet processed by honest nodes (except by the one who mined it). As per the \rulelc policy, all honest nodes start processing this block. Until honest nodes process this block, they still attempt to mine a new block at height $2$.
        (b) Some blocks may be mined at the same height $2$, which do not lead to chain growth. Therefore, the chain growth rate is less than the total block mining rate of the honest nodes.
        (c) When honest nodes finish processing the first block at height $2$ (which takes at most $1/\bwtime$ time since that block was announced), they now attempt to mine the next block extending it at height $3$.
        Note: If the same node produces two consecutive blocks, then the second of the two blocks will be at a new height as this node has already processed the first.
        However, when the number of miners is large and each miner owns a small share of the mining power, the probability that the same miner produces two consecutive blocks is very small, and therefore can be neglected (\eg, with $N$ equipotent miners, the probability is $1/N$).

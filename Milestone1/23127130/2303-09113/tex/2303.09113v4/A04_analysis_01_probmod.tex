\subsection{Probabilistic Model for PoW NC Executions}
\label{sec:fullproof-probmodel}


Recall that the protocol runs in \timeslots of duration $\slotduration$.
A \emph{block production opportunity} (\BPO) is a pair $(p,t)$ where according
to the PoW block production lottery,
node $p$ is eligible to produce a block in \timeslot $t$.
A \BPO is called \emph{honest} (resp.\ \emph{adversary}) if node $p$ is honest (resp.\ adversary).
The random variables $H_t$ and $A_t$ 
denote
the number of honest and adversary 
\BPOs
in \timeslot $t$, respectively.
When the number of nodes $N\to\infty$ and each node holds an equal rate of block production, by the Poisson approximation of a binomial random variable,
we have $\Hat{t}\overset{\text{i.i.d.}}{\sim}\mathrm{Poisson}((1-\beta)\rho)$
and $\Aat{t}\overset{\text{i.i.d.}}{\sim}\mathrm{Poisson}(\beta\rho)$, independent of each other and across \timeslots.
The total number of \BPOs per \timeslot is $\Qat{t} \triangleq \Hat{t} + \Aat{t}$.
An \emph{execution} refers to a particular realization of the random process $\{(\Hat{t}, \Aat{t})\}$.

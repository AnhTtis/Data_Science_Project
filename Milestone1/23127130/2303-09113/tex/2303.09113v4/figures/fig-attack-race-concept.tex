        \textbf{Private attack (recap):}
        Based on the tip of the longest chain
        when the private attack starts,
        the adversary mines
        a \emph{private} \textcolor{myParula07Red}{adversary chain},
        while honest nodes jointly grow a \emph{public} \textcolor{myParula05Green}{honest chain}.
        The adversary's goal is to deconfirm
        a transaction $\tx$ included on the honest chain just below
        where the adversary chain forks off.
        Adversary mining is perfectly coordinated
        so that the adversary chain grows at the
        adversary block production rate $\blkratetimeAdv$.
        Honest nodes suffer from forking due to network delay
        so that the honest chain grows at
        a lower rate $\blkratetimeGrowth < \blkratetimeHon$
        than the total block production rate $\blkratetimeHon$
        of honest nodes.
        The attack succeeds if the adversary chain grows faster
        than the honest chain ($\blkratetimeAdv > \blkratetimeGrowth$) and thus,
        irrespective of the confirmation depth $\confDepth$ chosen for NC,
        the adversary
        chain can eventually displace the honest chain 
        as the longest chain and with that deconfirm $\tx$.

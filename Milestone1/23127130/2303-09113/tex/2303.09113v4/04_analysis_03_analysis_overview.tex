\subsection{Analysis in the Probabilistic Model}
\label{sec:proof-analysis-overview}


We follow \cref{fig:analysis-comparison-sleepy}(b).
%
First, 
%
we show (\cref{sec:proof-analysis-cps-stabilize})
that blocks from \sltcps \emph{stabilize}, \ie,
they are in the longest processed chain of all nodes forever
(\cref{lem:cps-stabilize-informal}).
This is useful because
\emph{if we know that \sltcps occur frequently},
then honest nodes can confirm transactions that
%
must lie in 
%
the prefix of
a \sltcp's block (\emph{safety}),
and \sltcps' blocks (being produced by honest nodes)
bring any outstanding transactions onto chain (\emph{liveness}).
%
We then show that \sltcps occur frequently:
%
We show with a new probabilistic argument
(\cref{sec:proof-analysis-many-pps})
that \emph{\sltpps are abundant}, \ie,
in every `sufficiently long' interval (\ie, of length $\Omega(\kappa^2)$),
a constant fraction of the \timeslots are \sltpps (\cref{lem:many-pps-informal}).
%
Due to the decoupling of \sltcps and \sltpps, the proof up to this point does not depend on the capacity constraint and the scheduling policy.
Then, we show with a new combinatorial argument
(\cref{sec:proof-analysis-many-pps-one-cps})
that \emph{the adversary cannot prevent all \sltpps from becoming \sltcps},
\ie, in every `sufficiently long' interval,
there is at least one \sltcp (\cref{lem:many-pps-one-cps-informal}).
%
As a result,
if honest nodes confirm transactions that are still on their longest processed chain
after `sufficiently long' time (\ie, confirmation latency $\Omega(\kappa^2)$),
%
then PoW NC 
%
is safe and live under bounded capacity (\cref{sec:proof-pow}).

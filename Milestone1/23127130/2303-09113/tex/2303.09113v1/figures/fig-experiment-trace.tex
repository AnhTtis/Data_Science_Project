        A trace of a simulation of the longest chain protocol using a scheduling rule.
        This trace displays the timeline of events for each of 4 nodes. The nodes have a total mining rate $\blkratetime = 1$,
        %
        and each processes blocks at a rate of $\bwtime=1$. Blocks appear as squares at coordinate $(t,p)$ if they were mined by node $p$ at time $t$.
        %
        The $i$-th block of height $h$ to be mined is named $h.i$.
        For each node, we also display which blocks it is processing throughout the simulation, using horizontal bars from start to end of the processing.%

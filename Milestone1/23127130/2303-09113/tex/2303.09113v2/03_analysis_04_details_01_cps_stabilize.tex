\subsubsection{Combinatorial Pivots Stabilize}
\label{sec:analysis-details-cps-stabilize}

In this section, we show that the honest block produced in a \timeslot corresponding to a \sltcp persists in the longest downloaded chain of all honest nodes after $\goodsep$ \timeslots.
Towards this, we first show that if $\Dat{k}=1$, \ie, if all honest nodes download the block produced in the \sltgood \timeslot $t_k$, 
%
then the length of the longest downloaded chain of honest nodes increases (made precise in \cref{prop:chain-growth}).
Due to this, since all intervals around a \sltcp contain more \iindices with $\Dat{k}=1$ than those with $\Dat{k}=0$,
there can never be a chain which is longer than an honest node's longest downloaded chain and does not contain the block corresponding to the \sltcp (\cref{lem:cps-stabilize}).
%
In turn, this means that the block corresponding to the \sltcp remains in all honest nodes' longest downloaded chains forever.
\Cref{lem:cps-stabilize} is proved in \fullVersionRef{\cref{sec:appendix-full-version-proofs-cps-stabilize}} using tools similar to \cite{dem20,sleepy}.

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:chain-growth}
If $\Dat{k} = 1$, then $L_{\min}(t_k + \goodsep) \geq L_{\min}(t_k-1) + 1$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Since $\Dat{k} = 1$, \timeslot $t_k$ is a \sltgood \timeslot.
Let $b$ be the unique honest block produced in \timeslot $t_k$, and let honest node $p$ be its producer.
Since honest nodes produce blocks on their longest downloaded chain, $\len{b} = L_p(t_k-1) + 1 \geq L_{\min}(t_k-1) + 1$.
Further, $\Dat{k} = 1$ means that the block $b$ is downloaded by all honest nodes by the end of \timeslot $t_k + \goodsep$. Therefore, $L_{\min}(t_k + \goodsep) \geq \len{b}$.
\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:cps-stabilize}
Let $b^*$ be the block produced in a non-\sltempty \timeslot $t_k$ such that $\predCP{k}$. 
Then for all header chains $\Chain'$ that are valid at \timeslot $t \geq t_k + \goodsep$ and $\len{\Chain'} \geq L_{\min}(t)$, $b^* \in \Chain'$.
Further, for all honest nodes $p$ and for all \timeslots $t \geq t_k + \goodsep$, $b^* \in \dC_p(t)$.
\end{lemma}

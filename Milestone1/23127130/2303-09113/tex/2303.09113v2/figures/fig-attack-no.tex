    \caption{
        Honest chain growth when the adversary does not release blocks (no attack or the private attack). Semi-transparent blocks have been announced (\ie, headers released) but were not yet downloaded by honest nodes.
        (a) A new block is announced at height $2$. This block is not yet processed by most of the nodes. As per the \rulelc policy, all honest nodes start processing this block. Until honest nodes process this block, they still attempt to mine a new block at height $2$.
        (b) Some blocks may be mined at the same height $2$, which do not lead to chain growth.
        (c) When honest nodes finish processing the first block at height $2$ (which takes at most $1/\bwtime$ time since that block was announced), they now attempt to mine the next block extending it at height $3$.
        Note: If the same node produces two consecutive blocks, then the second of the two blocks will be at a new height as this node has already processed the first.
        However, when the number of nodes is large, the probability that the same node produces two consecutive blocks is very small, and therefore can be neglected.

        \textbf{\Teaserattack:}
        %
        \textcolor{myParula05Green}{Green}/\textcolor{myParula07Red}{red} are honest/adversarial blocks, 
        %
        and 
        %
        numbers on blocks indicate 
        %
        height in the blockchain. Semi-transparent blocks have been announced (\ie, headers released) but were not yet downloaded by honest nodes.
        %
        %
        %
        (a) We begin when 
        %
        honest nodes have a chain of length $2$. All blocks have been downloaded and 
        %
        validated by honest nodes.
        The adversary mines a private chain extending its own block at height $1$ that it keeps withheld.
        %
        (b) An honest node builds a block at height $h=3$, and announces it. The majority of the nodes are still mining on top of the block at height $h-1$. The adversary wishes to delay the download of the new block.
        %
        (c) The adversary announces a block at height $h+1$ from the chain it had been withholding.
        %
        Since this is 
        %
        the longest announced chain, honest nodes prioritize its download beginning with the adversary's block $2$.
        %
        (d) Honest nodes have downloaded and validated the adversary's block $2$. Since they do not yet have a longer validated chain, they keep mining as before. When they request the adversary's block of height $h=3$, they find it to be unavailable (`\textcolor{myParula07Red}{?}'), \ie the adversary does not release its content. So honest nodes ignore the rest of the attacker's chain and resume downloading the honest block of height $h=3$. 
        %
        (e) While download of the honest block was delayed, some mining power may have been wasted and another honest block of height $h=3$ may have been produced. Notice now that we are in a scenario similar to that in step (a), so the adversary can repeat steps (b) with the next honest block of height $h+1$.
        %
        (f) Once an honest node mines a block of height $4$, the attacker announces a block at height $5$, and proceeds to allow a download of height $3$, delaying again the verification of the honest block at height $4$.
        %
        Eventually, the attack breaks safety as the adversary releases content for the rest of its chain to overtake the honest chain.

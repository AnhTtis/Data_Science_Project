\begin{lemma}
    \label{lem:safety-and-liveness-comb-pow}
    If for some $\Kcp > 0$,
    \begin{IEEEeqnarray}{C}
        \label{eq:condition-one-cp-m-pow-safety}
        \forall m \geq 0 \colon \exists k_m^* \in \intvl{m\Kcp}{(m+1)\Kcp} \colon \predCP{k_m^*},
        \IEEEeqnarraynumspace
    \end{IEEEeqnarray}
    then the PoW Nakamoto consensus protocol $\protocol$ with $\confDepth = 2\Kcp + 1$ satisfies safety.
    Further, if
    \begin{IEEEeqnarray}{C}
        \label{eq:cond-index-time-bridge-pow}
        \forall k \in \IN, K \geq \Kcp \colon t_{k+K} - t_{k} < \frac{K}{\blkratetime\slotduration(1-\delta)},
        \IEEEeqnarraynumspace
    \end{IEEEeqnarray}
    then it also satisfies liveness with $\Tlive = \frac{6\Kcp + 2}{\blkratetime\slotduration(1-\delta)}$.
\end{lemma}

The proof of \cref{lem:safety-and-liveness-comb-pow} is similar to that of 
the PoS case (in fact, much simpler) which is shown in \cref{sec:appendix-pos-proofs}. \Eqref{cond-index-time-bridge-pow} shows an event which occurs with overwhelming probability, and helps to determine the latency in \emph{real time} from the analysis which is in terms of \iindices. Detailed proof for the PoW case is in \fullVersionRef{\cref{sec:appendix-full-version-proofs-pow}}.

Briefly, to prove \cref{thm:safety-and-liveness-pow}, we calculate for given $\DeltaHeader,\bwtime,\goodsepbw$, the values of $\blkratetime$ for which with overwhelming probability, the conditions of \cref{lem:one-cp-induction-full} hold. This ensures that \sltcps occur and then \cref{lem:safety-and-liveness-comb-pow} proves safety and liveness. Finally, since $\goodsepbw$ is just an analysis parameter, we optimize over $\goodsepbw$ to find the maximum $\blkratetime$. Details are in \fullVersionRef{\cref{sec:appendix-full-version-proofs-pow}}.

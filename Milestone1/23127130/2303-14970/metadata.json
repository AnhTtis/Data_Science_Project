    "abstract": "We prove that for every tree $T$ of radius $h$, there is an integer $c$ such that every $T$-minor-free graph is contained in $H\\boxtimes K_c$ for some graph $H$ with pathwidth at most $2h-1$. This is a qualitative strengthening of the Excluded Tree Minor Theorem of Robertson and Seymour (GM I). We show that radius is the right parameter to consider in this setting, and $2h-1$ is the best possible bound.",

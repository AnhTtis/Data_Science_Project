    "abstract": "Novae were discovered to emit transient gamma rays during the period of several days to a few weeks after initial explosion, indicating presence of acceleration processes of particles in their expanding shells. In the case of recurrent novae, electrons can be in principle accelerated in the nova shells for the whole recurrence period of nova producing delayed $γ$ ray emission as considered in Bednarek (2022). Here we extend the ideas presented in this article by considering the fate of electrons which diffuse out of the shells of novae supplying fresh relativistic electrons to the recurrent nova super-remnants during the whole active period of nova ($\\ge 10^4$ yrs). We develop a model for the acceleration of electrons and their escape from the nova shells. The electrons within the recurrent nova super-remnants produce $γ$ rays in the comptonization process of the radiation from the red giant companion and the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation. As an example, the case of a symbiotic nova RS Oph (with the recurrence period estimated on $\\sim$10-50 yrs) is considered in more detail. Predicted $γ$-ray emission from the nova super-remnant around RS Oph is discussed in the context of its observability by satellite experiments (i.e. Fermi-LAT) as well as current and future Cherenkov telescopes.",

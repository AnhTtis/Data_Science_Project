\section{Conclusion and Extension}

We presented Saihu, a Python interface capable of executing multiple network analysis tools easily. It allows users to define a network and retrieve the analysis results for multiple tools. Its unified input and output layers enable the automation of all the tedious re-interpretation of a network for each tool. Such design not only simplifies many mechanical procedures previously hindering network researchers' works but also helps publicize these useful tools to more potential users due to its simplicity.

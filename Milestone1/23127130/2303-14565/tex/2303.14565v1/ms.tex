    \begin{abstract}  
   Time-sensitive networks, as in the context of IEEE-TSN and IETF-Detnet, require bounds on worst-case delays. Various network analysis tools compute such bounds, but these tools are based on different methods and provide different valid delay bounds. Hence, it is essential to identify the best, smallest bounds. As of today, users must implement multiple pieces of code with different syntaxes for each tool, as each tool is implemented by different groups and uses different programming languages and syntaxes. This results in a significant amount of mechanical actions from users and being error-prone. In this paper, we present \emph{Saihu}, a Python interface that integrates xTFA (supports TFA), DiscoDNC (supports LUDB, PMOO, SFA), and Panco (supports PLP and ELP), the three most frequently used  worst-case network analysis tools. Saihu provides a general interface that enables defining the networks in a single XML or JSON file and executing all tools simultaneously without any adjustment for individual tools. Saihu also exports analysis results into formatted reports automatically, and it offers automatic network generation for certain types of networks. Therefore, with its straightforward syntax and ease of execution, Saihu reduces the burden on users and makes it a valuable tool for anyone working with time-sensitive networks.  Lastly, we modularize the package to incorporate more tools in the future.

    
        % This paper presents Saihu, a Python interface that integrates multiple network analysis tools for obtaining bounds on worst-case delays. With Saihu, users can access multiple analysis tools and methods using straightforward syntax and easy execution: Saihu integrates three worst-case network analysis tools based on the network calculus framework, namely \textit{xTFA}, \textit{DiscoDNC}, and \textit{Panco}. While previously users are required to implement multiple pieces of code with different syntax for each tool respectively, Saihu provides a general interface for all tools and minimizes the required mechanical actions from users.
        % The main contribution of Saihu is that it allows users to define their networks via a single XML or JSON file and execute all tools at once without adjustment for individual tools. Saihu can also export analysis results into formatted reports automatically. Most importantly, Saihu demands only a very limited amount of commands from users.
        % ; fourth, it allows automatic network generation for certain types of networks; finally, We modularize the package so that it can incorporate more tools in the future.

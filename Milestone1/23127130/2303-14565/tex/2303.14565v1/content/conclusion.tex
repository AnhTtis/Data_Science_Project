\section{Conclusion}

We presented Saihu, a Python interface that is capable of executing multiple network analysis tools that is easy to use and extend. Saihu provides methods to define a network and to retrieve the analysis results for multiple tools, which is achieved by having unified input and output layers for each tool and automating the required internal processing. With the example provided in this paper, we showed that Saihu can indeed simplify many mechanical procedures previously hindering network researchers' works, and it can handle a real-world configuration with the tools it includes.
% We believe that Saihu can bring these useful network analysis tools to a broader audience due to its convenience. 

% \textbf{Future Work}
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item Include more tools
%     \item Optimize the internal processing for better speed, maybe consider parallelism 
%     \item Not limited to python but provides a UI?
%     \item Error maintenance.
%     \item As many error checks from user commands and exception handling as possible.
% \end{enumerate}

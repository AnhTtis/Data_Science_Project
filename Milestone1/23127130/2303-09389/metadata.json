    "abstract": "Betatron oscillation of trapped electrons in laser-driven long-distance propagating plasma bubble has been investigated with the help of particle-in-cell simulations and theoretical analysis. Parametric oscillation of the trapped electron beam is identified as a result of bubble breathing which develops with the steepening and depletion of the laser pulse. It leads to parametric amplification of the betatron oscillation of the electron beam with the exponential growth of its amplitude. It results in severe degradation of the qualities of the electron beam and thus is important for long-scale laser wakefield acceleration.",

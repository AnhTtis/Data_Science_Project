@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note=" Noted that Eq.~\protect \textup  {\hbox {\mathsurround \z@ \protect \normalfont  (\ignorespaces \ref {eq:momentum_equation}\unskip \@@italiccorr )}} can be used to describe the centroid trajectory of a trapped electron beam if its beam size and divergence are small in comparison with the plasma wavelength. Therefore, the discussion here also applies to the electron beam's centroid dynamics to some extent. "}

@article{Sohbatzadeh2013gro,
	abstract = {{The excitation of wake field plasma waves by a short laser pulse propagating through a parabolic plasma channel is studied. The laser pulse is assumed to be initially chirped. In this regard, the effects of initial and induced chirp on the plasma wake field as well as the laser pulse parameters are investigated. The group velocity dispersion and nonlinear relativistic effects were taken into account to evaluate the excited wake field in two dimension using source dependent expansion method. Positive, negative, and un-chirped laser pulses were employed in numerical code to evaluate the effectiveness of the initial chirp on 2-D wake field excitation. Numerical results showed that for laser irradiances exceeding 1018W/cm2, an intense laser pulse with initial positive chirp generates larger wake field compared to negatively and un-chirped pulses.}},

@article{Pathak2012eff,
	abstract = {The role of laser frequency chirps in the laser wakefield accelerator is examined. We show that in the linear regime, the evolution of the laser pulse length is affected by the frequency chirp, and that positive (negative) chirp compresses (stretches) the laser pulse, thereby increasing (decreasing) the peak vector potential and wakefield amplitude. In the blowout regime, the frequency chirp can be used to fine-tune the localized etching rates at the front of the laser. In our simulations, chirped laser pulses can lead to 15% higher self-trapped electrons and 10% higher peak energies as compared to the transform-limited pulse. Chirps may be used to control the phase velocity of the wake and to relax the self-guiding conditions at the front of the laser. Our predictions are confirmed by multi-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations with OSIRIS.},

@article{Zhang2012eff,
	abstract = {{A laser wakefield driven by an asymmetric laser pulse with/without chirp is investigated analytically and through two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. For a laser pulse with an appropriate pulse length compared with the plasma wavelength, the wakefield amplitude can be enhanced by using an asymmetric un-chirped laser pulse with a fast rise time; however, the growth is small. On the other hand, the wakefield can be greatly enhanced for both positively chirped laser pulse having a fast rise time and negatively chirped laser pulse having a slow rise time. Simulations show that at the early laser-plasma interaction stage, due to the influence of the fast rise time the wakefield driven by the positively chirped laser pulse is more intense than that driven by the negatively chirped laser pulse, which is in good agreement with analytical results. At a later time, since the laser pulse with positive chirp exhibits opposite evolution to the one with negative chirp when propagating in plasma, the wakefield in the latter case grows more intensely. These effects should be useful in laser wakefield acceleration experiments operating at low plasma densities.}},

@article{Kim2023pol,
	abstract = {We describe an interplay between two injection mechanism of background electrons into an evolving plasma bubble behind an intense laser pulse: one due to the overall bubble expansion, and another due to its periodic undulation. The two mechanisms occur simultaneously when an intense laser pulse propagating inside a plasma forms a shock-like steepened front. Periodic undulations of the plasma bubble along the laser propagation path can either inhibit or conspire with electron injection due to bubble expansion. We show that carrier-envelope-phase (CEP) controlled plasma bubble undulation induced by the self-steepening laser pulse produces a unique electron injector---expanding phase-controlled undulating bubble (EPUB). The longitudinal structure of the electron bunch injected by the EPUB can be controlled by laser polarization and power, resulting in high-charge (multiple nano-Coulombs) high-current (tens of kilo-amperes) electron beams with ultra-short (femtosecond-scale) temporal structure. Generation of high-energy betatron radiation with polarization- and CEP-controlled energy spectrum and angular distribution is analyzed as a promising application of EPUB-produced beams.},

Under fixed transverse and longitudinal ponderomotive force, the effect of optical cycles on the evolution of bubble structure and electron injection is studied by changing the laser wavelength. For a multi-cycle laser, electron acceleration is dominated by the ponderomotive force that produces symmetrical bubble and continuous injection. As the optical cycles decrease, the dominant effect of the electron acceleration can transition from the ponderomotive force to the carrier wave, and the carrier envelope phase shift can cause transverse oscillation of the bubble and periodic electron injection in the direction of laser polarization. The criterion for the dominant acceleration mechanism and the dependence of transition distance on the optical cycles and pulse width are obtained. The results are beneficial for manipulating electron acceleration and betatron radiation generation.}},

@article{Huijts2021ide,
	abstract = {{Driving laser wakefield acceleration with extremely short, near single-cycle laser pulses is crucial to the realization of an electron source that can operate at kHz-repetition rate while relying on modest laser energy. It is also interesting from a fundamental point of view, as the ponderomotive approximation is no longer valid for such short pulses. Through particle-in-cell simulations, we show how the plasma response becomes asymmetric in the plane of laser polarization, and dependent on the carrier-envelope phase (CEP) of the laser pulse. For the case of self-injection, this in turn strongly affects the initial conditions of injected electrons, causing collective betatron oscillations of the electron beam. As a result, the electron beam pointing, electron energy spectrum, and the direction of emitted betatron radiation become CEP dependent. For injection in a density gradient, the effect on beam pointing is reduced and the electron energy spectrum is CEP independent, as electron injection is mostly longitudinal and mainly determined by the density gradient. Our results highlight the importance of controlling the CEP in this regime for producing stable and reproducible relativistic electron beams and identify how CEP effects may be observed in experiments. In the future, CEP control may become an additional tool to control the energy spectrum or pointing of the accelerated electron beam.}},

When the laser pulse duration is long enough, the ionization injected electrons would not only possess angular momentum, but also be resonant with the laser pulses, resulting in helix structure trajectories in the process of acceleration. In our simulation, we acquired synchrotron radiation with the circularly polarized degree Pc  ∼0.8, the pulse duration ∼16 fs, the energy spectrum peak ∼1 keV and the brilliance ∼1.8 ×1020 photons s−1 mm−2 mrad−2/0.1{\%}BW.

@article{GallardoGonzalez2018aa,
	abstract = {In this work, we experimentally study the effects of the nitrogen concentration in laser wakefield acceleration of electrons in a gas mixture of hydrogen and nitrogen. A 15 TW peak power laser pulse is focused to ionize the gas, excite a plasma wave and accelerate electrons up to 230 MeV. We find that at dopant concentrations above 2{\%} the total divergence of the electrons is increased and the high energy electrons are emitted preferentially with an angle of $\pm$6 mrad, leading to a forked spatio-spectral distribution associated to direct laser acceleration (DLA). However, electrons can gain more energy and have a divergence lower than 4 mrad for concentrations below 0.5{\%} and the same laser and plasma conditions. Particle-in-cell simulations show that for dopant concentrations above 2{\%}, the amount of trapped charge is large enough to significantly perturb the plasma wave, reducing the amplitude of the longitudinal wakefield and suppressing other trapping mechanisms. At high concentrations the number of trapped electrons overlapping with the laser fields is increased, which rises the amount of charge affected by DLA. We conclude that the dopant concentration affects the quantity of electrons that experience significant DLA and the beam loading of the plasma wave driven by the laser pulse. These two mechanisms influence the electrons final energy, and thus the dopant concentration should be considered as a factor for the optimization of the electron beam parameters.},

	abstract = {Laser-plasma accelerators can produce high-quality electron beams, up to giga electronvolts in energy, from a centimetre scale device. The properties of the electron beams and the accelerator stability are largely determined by the injection stage of electrons into the accelerator. The simplest mechanism of injection is self-injection, in which the wakefield is strong enough to trap cold plasma electrons into the laser wake. The main drawback of this method is its lack of shot-to-shot stability. Here we present experimental and numerical results that demonstrate the existence of two different self-injection mechanisms. Transverse self-injection is shown to lead to low stability and poor-quality electron beams, because of a strong dependence on the intensity profile of the laser pulse. In contrast, longitudinal injection, which is unambiguously observed for the first time, is shown to lead to much more stable acceleration and higher-quality electron beams.},

	abstract = {Laser pulses in current ultra-short TW systems are far from being ideal Gaussian beams. The influence of the presence of non-Gaussian features of the laser pulse is investigated here from experiments and 3D Particle-in-Cell simulations. Both the experimental intensity distribution and wavefront are used as input in the simulations. It is shown that a quantitative agreement between experimental data and simulations requires to use realistic pulse features. Moreover, some trends found in the experiments, such as the growing of the X-ray signal with the plasma length, can only be retrieved in simulations with realistic pulses. The performances on the electron acceleration and the synchrotron X-ray emission are strongly degraded by these non-Gaussian features, even keeping constant the total laser energy. A drop on the X-ray photon number by one order of magnitude was found. This clearly put forward the limitation of using a Gaussian beam in the simulations.},

Most methods for generating betatron radiation are based on two typical approaches, one relying on an inherent transverse focusing electrostatic field, which induces transverse oscillation, and the other relying on the electron beam catching up with the rear part of the laser pulse, which results in strong electron resonance. Here, we present a new regime of betatron γ-ray radiation generated by stimulating a large-amplitude transverse oscillation of a continuously injected electron bunch through the hosing of the bubble induced by the carrier envelope phase (CEP) effect of the self-steepened laser pulse. Our method increases the critical photon energy to the MeV level, according to the results of particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. The highly collimated, energetic and femtosecond γ-ray bursts that are produced in this way may provide an interesting potential means of exploring nuclear physics in table top photo nuclear reactions.},

We present an extension to QSA that is free from many of its limitations and retains its main advantages of speed and reduced dimensionality. The new approach takes into account the exchange of information between adjacent plasma layers.

@article{Shukla1986aa,
	abstract = {The purpose of this article is to present a review of the nonlinear effects associated with relativistic electron-mass variation and the ponderomotive force in unmagnetized as well as magnetized plasmas. Many high-frequency waves can become unstable with respect to the electron-mass modulation and the excitation of low-frequency density fluctuations. The nonlinear equations which govern the evolution of the modulationally unstable waves are derived. The phenomena of soliton formation, radiation collapse, and profile modification are investigated. Finite amplitude theories of the envelope solitons are reviewed. In a multidimensional situation, the electromagnetic waves can undergo self-focusing. The use of the variational methods allows one to calculate the nonlinear wavenumber and radius of the self-focused laser beams. Analytical solutions for the self-trapped radiation and the three-dimensional relativistic solitons are obtained. It is found that magnetized plasmas can support the propagation of new types of ultrarelativistic electromagnetic waves. The modulational instability of the latter is analyzed. Furthermore, it is shown that the relativistic ponderomotive force in a magnetized plasma can produce large amplitude field-aligned electrostatic potentials which can effectively accelerate particles to very high energies. Finally, we consider the nonlinear propagation of intense electromagnetic waves in electron-positron plasmas. Possible applications in inertial fusion, beat-wave particle accelerator, rf heating of magnetically confined plasmas, and pulsar radiation are pointed out.},

@article{Rakowski2022aa,
	abstract = {Ultrafast high-brightness X-ray pulses have proven invaluable for a broad range of research. Such pulses are typically generated via synchrotron emission from relativistic electron bunches using large-scale facilities. Recently, significantly more compact X-ray sources based on laser-wakefield accelerated (LWFA) electron beams have been demonstrated. In particular, laser-driven sources, where the radiation is generated by transverse oscillations of electrons within the plasma accelerator structure (so-called betatron oscillations) can generate highly-brilliant ultrashort X-ray pulses using a comparably simple setup. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a method to markedly enhance the parameters of LWFA-driven betatron X-ray emission in a proof-of-principle experiment. We show a significant increase in the number of generated photons by specifically manipulating the amplitude of the betatron oscillations by using our novel Transverse Oscillating Bubble Enhanced Betatron Radiation scheme. We realize this through an orchestrated evolution of the temporal laser pulse shape and the accelerating plasma structure. This leads to controlled off-axis injection of electrons that perform large-amplitude collective transverse betatron oscillations, resulting in increased radiation emission. Our concept holds the promise for a method to optimize the X-ray parameters for specific applications, such as time-resolved investigations with spatial and temporal atomic resolution or advanced high-resolution imaging modalities, and the generation of X-ray beams with even higher peak and average brightness.},

	abstract = {{Reliable modeling of laser-plasma accelerators, where a short and intense laser pulse propagates in an underdense plasma over long distances, is a computationally challenging task. This is due to the great disparity among the scales involved in the modeling, ranging from the micrometer scale of the laser wavelength to, for instance, the meter scale of the laser-plasma interaction length for a multi-GeV-class laser-plasma accelerator. To reduce such imbalance, the time-averaged ponderomotive approximation may be used, where the plasma particle dynamics is analytically averaged over the laser frequency, and only spatiotemporal scales associated with the laser envelope are retained in the calculations, resulting in significant computational savings. In this paper, we characterize the accuracy and robustness of the time-averaged ponderomotive approximation for a range of laser parameters of interest for present and future laser-plasma accelerators, and we show that the error introduced by the averaging process is small in all relevant cases.}},

Based on these averaged equations, a new particle code is designed which calculates the particle trajectories on the plasma period time scale. The regime of total cavitation of the plasma is investigated. It is found that stable propagation over a long distance is possible in this regime, and that energetic electrons are produced with a simple characteristic dependence of their angle of deflection on energy. This new code allows for computationally efficient modeling of pulse propagation over great distances.}},

    "abstract": "We demonstrate the presence of non-invertible symmetries in an infinite family of superconformal Argyres-Douglas theories. This class of theories arises from diagonal gauging of the flavor symmetry of a collection of multiple copies of $D_p(\\mathrm{SU}(N))$ theories. The same set of theories that we study can also be realized from 6d $\\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ compactification on a torus. The main example in this class is the $(A_2, D_4)$ theory. We show in detail that this specific theory bears the same structures of non-invertible duality and triality defects as those of $\\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills with gauge algebra $\\mathfrak{su}(2)$. We extend this result to infinitely many other Argyres-Douglas theories in the same family, including those with central charges $a=c$ whose conformal manifold is one dimensional, and those with $a\\neq c$ whose conformal manifold has dimension larger than one. Our result is supported by examining certain special cases that can be realized in terms of theories of class $\\mathcal{S}$.",

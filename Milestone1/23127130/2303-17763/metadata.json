    "abstract": "Using the two-component model, we analyze Bose-Einstein correlations (BEC) at 13 TeV, measured by the CMS collaboration, and compare results with the $τ$-model. We utilize data described by the double ratios with [$0\\le k_T\\le 1.0$ GeV and six intervals for $N_{\\rm trk}^{\\rm offline}$]. The estimated range is 1-4 fm for the exponential form $R_1$ and 0.4-0.5 fm for the Gaussian form $R_2$. We estimate the upper limits of the 3-pion BEC to test the two-component model and investigate the role of the long-range correlation.",

    "abstract": "Within the model of coupled nonlinear Schroedinger equations, a new type of long-lived solitary structures has been numerically revealed for paraxial optics with two circular polarizations of light in a homogeneous defocusing Kerr medium with anomalous group velocity dispersion. The found hybrid three-dimensional soliton is a vortex ring on a plane-wave background in one component, where the vortex core is filled with the other component nonuniformly along the azimuthal angle. The existence in a certain parametric domain of such quasi-stationary structures with reduced symmetry is due to saturation of the so called sausage instability caused by effective surface tension of the domain wall between the two polarizations.",

    "abstract": "In this work we show that in several microscopic models for the pair-density-wave (PDW) state, when the PDW wave vectors connect special parts of the Fermi surface, the predominant instability driven by PDW fluctuations is toward a pairing state of the PDW boson themselves{, realizing a long-saught-after charge-$4e$ superconductor. Dual to the scenario for electron pairing, the effective attraction between the bosons is mediated by exchanging low-energy fermions.} In particular we show that the pairing interaction for the charge-$4e$ order is repulsive in the $s$-wave channel but attractive in the $d$-wave one. By analyzing the Ginzburg-Landau free energy including the fluctuation effects of PDW, within a large-$M$ extension of the theory, we find that the charge-$4e$ superconductivity emerges as a vestigial order of PDW, and sets in via a first-order transition.",

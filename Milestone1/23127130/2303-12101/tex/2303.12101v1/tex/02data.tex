\section{Data}\label{sec:data}

\input{tbl/sample}

We perform a joint analysis of the 19 PHANGS galaxies listed in \cref{tbl:sample}, combining MUSE optical spectroscopy, \textit{HST} stellar association catalogues, and \textit{AstroSat} $\FUV$ imaging.
The galaxies in the sample have masses in the range of $9.4<\log(M/\si{\Msun})<11.0$ and star formation rates  $-0.56<\log(\mathrm{SFR}/\si{\Msun\per\year})<1.23$. They contain diverse morphological features like bars, rings, and active galactic nuclei, enabling us to study the impact of a wide variety of parameters.

\subsection[MUSE HII region catalogue]{MUSE \HII region catalogue}

To trace the ionized gas, we use IFU data observed by the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer \citep[MUSE,][]{Bacon+2010} at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile. 
The PHANGS--MUSE survey (PI: Schinnerer) and the data reduction are described in \citet{Emsellem+2022}. 
They produced reduced and mosaicked spectral cubes and additional high-level data products like emission line maps. 
These maps achieve an average resolution of $\SI{0.72}{\arcsec}$, corresponding to a spatial resolution between \SIrange[range-phrase = {\text{~and~}}]{18.4}{77.9}{\parsec}, depending on the distance to the galaxy.

\citet{Santoro+2022} and \citet{Groves+2023} utilised these products to create a catalogue of \HII regions, which we use in this work and describe briefly below. 
\textsc{hiiphot} \citep{Thilker+2000} was used on the $\HA$ line maps to define the boundaries of the \HII regions based on their surface brightness profile. 
The integrated spectrum of each region was extracted from the spectral cubes and a number of nebular emission lines were fitted. 
We do not correct for the contribution of the diffuse ionized gas (DIG), as it is very sensitive to the exact \HII region boundaries and the majority of our \HII regions are bright ($L(\HA) >\SI{e37}{\erg\per\second}$ and $\HA$ surface brightness $>\SI{e39}{\erg\per\second\per\kilo\parsec\squared}$).
The fluxes were then corrected for Milky Way extinction with the extinction curve from \citet{ODonnell+1994}, adapting $R_V=3.1$ and $E(B-V)$ from \citet{Schlafly+2011}. For the internal extinction, the colour excess $E(B-V)$ is measured from the \emph{Balmer decrement}, assuming a theoretical ratio of $\HA/\HB=2.86$, and all fluxes are corrected assuming the same extinction curve parameters.

To remove contaminants such as supernova remnants or planetary nebulae, the \emph{Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich} (BPT) diagram \citep{Baldwin+1981} is used to classify the objects \citep[based on the demarcation lines by][using the $\NII$, $\SII$ and $\OI$ lines]{Kauffmann+2003,Kewley+2001b}. 
For each line used, we require a $\StoN>5$ to be included in the final catalogue. This conservative $\StoN$ cut accounts for the possibility that the line flux uncertainties are slightly underestimated \citep{Emsellem+2022}. Across 19 galaxies, a total of \num{31497} nebulae are detected and \num{23736} of them are classified as \HII regions.

Next, a number of physical properties are derived. 
We calculate $\EW$ following the procedure outlined in \citet{Westfall+2019}.
The $\HA$ and continuum flux are obtained by directly summing the spectral bins in the data cube.
Our \HII regions are observed in projection against the stellar disk, which is dominated by light from older stars that are not physically associated with the massive star-forming regions. 
To correct for this contribution to our $\EW$ measurement, we estimate the background contributed by the stellar continuum from a spectrum integrated over an annular mask. 
These masks are created by growing the existing nebula masks until they have increased by a factor of three in area, excluding any pixels that fall inside of other nebulae. 
We then calculate the background corrected equivalent width, $\EW_\mathrm{corr}$, by subtracting the background from continuum (but not from the $\HA$ line flux, see \cref{sec:bkg_EW} for more details).

The gas phase abundance $\logOH$ is measured with the $S$-calibration from \citet{Pilyugin+2016} and the radial abundance gradient is fitted and subtracted from the individual nebulae to get the local metallicity offset $\DeltaOH$ \citep{Kreckel+2019}. 
The ionization parameter $q=U/c$ is derived from the $\SIII/\SII$ ratio, based on the calibration by \citet{Diaz+1991}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:logq_D91}
        \log U=-1.684\cdot \log(\SIII/\SII)-2.986,
\end{equation}
where $\SIII/\SII=\SIII[(9069+9532)]\,/\,\SII[(6717+6731)]$. 
We measure $\SIII[9069]$ directly and assume a fixed atomic ratio of $\SIII[9532] = 2.5\cdot\SIII[9069]$ \citep{Osterbrock+2006}.

Finally we use \textsc{pyneb} \citep{Luridiana+2015} to derive the electron density from the $\SII[6731/6717]$ ratio. 
Ideally one would do this in conjunction with the temperature (e.g.\ from the $\NII[5755/6548]$ ratio). 
However, only $\sim\kern-2pt\SI{4}{\percent}$ of the \HII regions have a strong enough detection ($\StoN>10$) in the $\NII[5755]$ line to measure a temperature. 
We therefore assume a constant temperature of $\SI{8000}{\kelvin}$ for all nebulae. This is close to the mean temperature that we measure for the sub-sample that has a detection in the $\NII[5755]$ line \citep{Kreckel+2022}. 
That being said, the choice of $T_\mathrm{e}$ has only minor effects on the derived density (less than $\SI{10}{\percent}$, see also \cref{sec:CrossTemDen} for a more careful analysis).
More important is that most of the \HII regions are close to the low-density limit.
We apply the procedure outlined in \citet{Barnes+2021} and do not report densities for the regions that have $\SII[6731/6717]$ ratios within $3\sigma$ of this limit, as we are unable to derive reliable density measurements for them.

\subsection{\textit{HST} Stellar association catalogue}

The resolution of ground-based observations ($\sim\kern-5pt\SI{1}{\arcsec}$, corresponding to an average spatial resolution of $\sim\kern-2pt\SI{70}{\parsec}$ for the galaxies in our sample) is not sufficient to resolve the star clusters and associations that are the origin of the ionizing radiation and only the \textit{Hubble Space Telescope (HST)} is able to resolve the required $\sim\kern-4pt\SI{10}{\parsec}$ spatial scales \citep{Ryon+2017} in the optical and UV. 
The PHANGS--\textit{HST} survey (PI: Lee) covers 38 galaxies, including all galaxies in the PHANGS--MUSE sample, and is described in \citet{Lee+2022}. 
The galaxies were observed in 5 bands: F275W ($\NUV$), F336W (\textit{U}), F438W (\textit{B}), F555W (\textit{V}), F814W (\textit{I}). 

A number of high-level data products were produced by the PHANGS--\textit{HST} team. 
First is a catalogue of compact star clusters \citep[we use IR3 in this work]{Thilker+2022}. 
They are identified as sources that are slight more extended than a point source, based on their concentration index. 
However, the overlap with the \HII region catalogue is rather limited (as expected, as most clusters have ages $>\SI{10}{Myr}$) and we find that the majority of the ionizing sources are in OB associations \citep{Goddard+2010,Kruijssen+2012,Adamo+2015,Adamo+2020}. 
These larger and loosely bound structures were identified by \citet{Larson+2023} at different spatial scales and we use their multi-scale stellar association catalogue for our analysis.
A summary of the procedure is as follows, and also provided in \citet{Lee+2022}.
First, \textsc{dolphot} is used to create a catalogue of point-like sources (using either the $\NUV$ or \textit{V}-band). 
Then a `tracer image' is generated by smoothing to a fixed resolution (either $\SI{8}{\parsec}$, $\SI{16}{\parsec}$, $\SI{32}{\parsec}$ or $\SI{64}{\parsec}$) and a local background correction is applied to each by subtracting the equivalent image generated at four times larger scale. 
Next a \emph{watershed algorithm} \citep{Beucher+1979,vanderWalt+2014} is used to define the boundaries of the stellar associations that are identified at each scale as local enhancements in the background-subtracted tracer image.
Fluxes for the five available \textit{HST} filters are measured, using the photometry of detected stars, contained within the association.
Age, mass and reddening are derived by fitting theoretical models of a single stellar population \citep{Bruzual+2003} to the observed SED with \textsc{cigale} \citep{Boquien+2019}, assuming a fully sampled \citet{Chabrier+2003} IMF. The gas-phase metallicities are close to solar for most galaxies \citep{Groves+2023}, suggesting that the assumption of solar  metallicity is reasonable for the young stellar populations probed here. Complete details on the SED fitting are provided in \cite{Turner+2021}.

For this work, we choose to use the $\SI{32}{\parsec}$ stellar associations identified from the $\NUV$ images. 
This catalogue contains \num{16295} associations that fall within the MUSE field of view (FoV). 
This was done as the $\NUV$ is better at tracing the young massive stars that we are interested in, and the $\SI{32}{\parsec}$ structures are well matched to our MUSE resolution. 
While we find a larger number of \HII regions that overlap with the $\SI{64}{\parsec}$ associations, the percentage with a one-to-one relation is smaller, especially for the more nearby galaxies.
It should be noted that using a different scale for the analysis does not impact the results significantly.


\subsection{\textit{AstroSat}}

We used the Indian space telescope \textit{AstroSat} \citep{Singh+2014} to observe our galaxy sample in the far ultraviolet ($\FUV$, PI: Rosolowsky). 
The sample and data reduction are described in Hassani et al.\ (in preparation). The images have a resolution of $\SI{1.4}{\arcsec}$ with a pixel size of $\SI{0.42}{\arcsec}$, reasonably well matched to our MUSE resolution. 
Observations are available for 16 of the 19 MUSE galaxies (\galaxyname{NGC}{1087} and \galaxyname{NGC}{4303} can not be observed and for \galaxyname{NGC}{5068}, observing time is awarded but not yet executed). 
When available, we use the F148W filter, which is the case for all galaxies but \galaxyname{NGC}{1433}, \galaxyname{NGC}{1512} and \galaxyname{NGC}{4321}, which were observed with the F154W filter.
We subtract a uniform foreground that originates from Milky Way and solar system sources and whose average contribution varies between galaxies from \SIrange{1}{9}{\percent}.
% average of 3 percent
The \textit{AstroSat} images are then reprojected to the MUSE images to measure the $\FUV$ fluxes in the spatial masks of the nebula catalogue. 
The fluxes are corrected for Milky Way and internal extinction, following the procedure described for the \HII regions. 
For the colour excess we use the value derived from the Balmer decrement and assume $E(B-V)_\mathrm{stellar} = X \cdot E(B-V)_\mathrm{Balmer}$. 
It is common to use $X=0.44$ to account for the difference between the colour excess derived from the Balmer decrement and the stellar continuum \citep{Calzetti+2000}, reflecting that nebular sources are often more closely associated with dusty star-forming complexes in contrast to the bulk stellar light \citep{Charlot+2000}.
However, we are preferentially targeting stellar continuum emission that we believe to be co-spatial with the nebular emission, and so instead assume $X=1.0$. 
In \cref{sec:validate} we compare the colour excess derived from the Balmer decrement to the one from the SED fit and find good agreement between the two, validating this choice.

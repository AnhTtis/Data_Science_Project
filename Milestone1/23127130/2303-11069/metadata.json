    "abstract": "We consider the non-autonomous three-dimensional Roessler system under the external pulse action. In this work we describe changing of synchronization picture depending on the direction of the external action. Complex oscillatory modes, including quasi-periodic, chaotic and hyperchaotic, initiated by an external force are studied.",

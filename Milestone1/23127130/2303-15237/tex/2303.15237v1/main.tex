\begin{abstract}
We present a cascaded variational quantum eigensolver algorithm that only requires the execution of a set of quantum circuits once rather than at every iteration during the parameter optimization process, thereby reducing the number of needed circuit executions.  This algorithm lets a quantum processing unit probe all the needed probability mass functions and a classical processing unit perform all the remaining calculations, including the variational optimization.  The ansatz form does not restrict the solution space and provide full control over the parameter space, including the implementation of symmetry and other physically motivated constraints.

\maketitle

Quantum computing (QC) offers inherent advantages over classical computing (CC) for solving certain mathematical tasks~\cite{Benioff80,Feynman82,Deutsch85,Shor94,Shor97,Grover96,Lloyd96,Harrow09}.  One of the most promising application areas is the simulation of quantum-mechanical systems~\cite{Lloyd96,Abrams97,Ortiz01}.  Because the size of the Hilbert space comprising the quantum states of a quantum-mechanical system increases exponentially with the system size, performing operations on this space is an intractable task for conventional classical computers for all but the smallest systems.  A quantum computer, on the other hand, can process exponentially large vector spaces, including Hilbert spaces, by mapping them to the Hilbert space of a quantum register---the size of which increases exponentially with the number of qubits---and then performing quantum gate operations on this register.

The two main algorithms for QC calculations of quantum-mechanical systems are the quantum phase estimation algorithm~\cite{Kitaev96} and the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm~\cite{Peruzzo14}.  By recruiting classical computers for computationally efficient tasks, the latter algorithm requires relatively few gate operations, which limits the decoherence during the computations.  As less exposure to decoherence allows for higher computational fidelities, this algorithm has a reduced need for quantum error correction, making it ideal for current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers~\cite{Preskill18}.  Since its introduction, the VQE algorithm has been applied to calculate the ground-state energy of a number of systems in chemistry and physics~\cite{Peruzzo14,McClean16,OMalley16,McClean17,Li17,Kandala17,Colless18,Wang19,Arute19,Parrish19,McArdle20,Seki20,Huggins20,Arute20,Endo21,Cerezo21,Zhang22,Gonthier22,Tilly22}.  A disadvantage of the VQE algorithm is that it requires many quantum circuit executions as part of its iterative energy minimization process.  To prepare the needed trial states, the quantum circuit includes the implementation of an ansatz described by some operator $\hat A$ that depends on a collection of variational parameters $\theta$ generated by means of CC.  This dependence necessarily leads to a lot of back-and-forth communication between the quantum processing unit (QPU) and the classical processing unit (CPU).

To address this challenge, we propose a cascaded variational quantum eigensolver (CVQE) algorithm that separates the quantum circuit executions from the parameter optimization.  This variant is centered around an ansatz described by the ansatz operator in the form
\begin{equation}
   \hat{A}(\theta) = e^{i\hat\lambda(\theta)}\hat{U},
   \label{e.1}
\end{equation}
where $\hat\lambda(\theta)$ is any diagonal operator and $\hat U$ is any unitary operator, which in contrast to the commonly applied unitary coupled cluster ansatz~\cite{Yung14,Peruzzo14,McClean16,OMalley16,Shen17,Harsha18,Kivlichan18,Hempel18,Romero18,Lee19,Dallaire19,Setia19,Grimsley20,Matsuzawa20,Sokolov20,Nam20,Motta21,Bauman21}, the hardware-efficient ansatz~\cite{Kandala17,Barkoutsos18,Kandala19,Ganzhorn19,Kokail19,Nakanishi19,Gard20,Bravo20,Tkachenko21}, and those used in various adaptive or trainable VQE algorithms~\cite{Grimsley19,Rattew19,Chivilikhin20,Bilkis21,Cincio21,Tang21,Yordanov21,Du22}, is independent of $\theta$.

To show the method enabling the CVQE algorithm, consider a system of identical fermions described by some Hamiltonian $\hat H$.  Our goal is to get an upper bound for the ground-state energy $E_\text g$ of the system by applying the variational method of quantum mechanics, which can be stated as
\begin{equation}
	E_\text g \le \min_\theta E(\theta),
	\label{e.2}
\end{equation}
where $E(\theta)$ denotes an energy expectation value.

Our method begins with the vacuum state $\ket{0}$ in some antisymmetric Fock space $\mathcal{F}$ that serves as a representation space for the quantum states of our chosen fermionic system.  We then apply a unitary operator $\hat{U}$ that acts on $\mathcal F$ to produce the initial state
\begin{equation}
	\ket{\Psi_0}=\hat{U}\ket{0}
	\label{e.3}
\end{equation}
for the variational optimization.  The energy expectation value of the ansatz state $\ket{\Psi(\theta)}=\hat{A}(\theta)\ket{0}$ can then be expressed as
\begin{equation}
	E(\theta) = \frac{\braket{\Psi_0|e^{-i\hat\lambda^\dagger(\theta)}\hat He^{i\hat\lambda(\theta)}|\Psi_0}}{\braket{\Psi_0|e^{-i\hat\lambda^\dagger(\theta)}e^{i\hat\lambda(\theta)}|\Psi_0}}.
	\label{e.4}
\end{equation}

To make further progress, we need a basis for the Fock space $\mathcal F$.  However, first we introduce the basis $\{\ket{\psi_q}\}$ indexed by $\mathcal{Q}=\{1,2,...,Q\}$ for the $Q$-dimensional, one-fermion Hilbert space $\mathcal H$.  For all $q\in\mathcal{Q}$, we let $n_q$ in the set $\mathbb B=\{0,1\}$ be equal to $0$ and $1$ when the one-fermion basis state $\ket{\psi_q}$ is unoccupied and occupied, respectively.  A basis $\{\ket{n}\}$ for $\mathcal F=\mathcal F(\mathcal H)$ labeled by the fermionic configurations $n=(n_q)_{q\in\mathcal{Q}}$ of occupation numbers can then be formed by the Fock states $\ket{n}=C_n^\dagger\ket{0}$, for all $n\in\mathbb B^Q$, where
\begin{equation}
	C_n^\dagger = \prod_{q\in\mathcal{Q}}\big(c^{\dagger}_q\big)^{n_q},
	\label{e.5}
\end{equation}
where $c_q^{\dagger}$ denotes fermionic creation operators.  Using this basis, we can express the diagonal operator in Eq.\,(\ref{e.1}) as
\begin{equation}
	\hat\lambda(\theta) = \sum_{n\in\mathbb B^Q}\lambda_n(\theta)\ket{n}\!\bra{n},
	\label{e.6}
\end{equation}
where $\lambda_n(\theta)\in\mathbb C$ are given coefficients that, together with those of $\hat U$, define a specific ansatz operator $\hat{A}(\theta)$.

As the dimension of the Fock space $\mathcal F$ is $2^Q$, and thus increases exponentially with $Q$, the energy expectation value in Eq.\,(\ref{e.4}) cannot in general be calculated efficiently using a CPU alone.  A QPU, on the other hand, is able to process such large spaces.  Looking for an isomorphism between $\mathcal F$ and the Hilbert space for the qubit register in the QPU, we consider a register comprising $Q$ qubits.  As the qubits are distinguishable, the register Hilbert space can be expressed as the tensor power $\mathtt H^{\otimes Q}$, where $\mathtt H$ is the two-dimensional one-qubit Hilbert space.  We can take advantage of tensor power structure by, for each qubit $q\in\mathcal{Q}$, letting $\{\ket{0},\ket{1}\}$ be a basis for its space $\mathtt H_q$ and mapping the occupation number $n_q$ to it.  Thus, each Fock state $\ket{n}$ in $\mathcal F$ is automatically mapped to the tensor product state
\begin{equation}
	\ket{n}=\bigotimes_{q\in\mathcal Q}\ket{n_q}
	\label{e.7}
\end{equation}
in $\mathtt H^{\otimes Q}$.

The probability that a measurement on a QPU in the basis $\{\ket{n}\}$ collapses the quantum state $\hat R_m\ket{\Psi_0}$, where $\hat R_m$ is a unitary operator, to the state $\ket{n}$ associated with a particular outcome $n$ is given by the probability mass function
\begin{equation}
	\operatorname{P}[\hat R_m\Psi_0\!\mapsto\! n] = \big|\!\braket{\Psi_0|\hat R_m^\dagger|n}\!\big|^2.
	\label{e.8}
\end{equation}
By performing a number of identical measurements of $\hat R_m\ket{\Psi_0}$ and recording the outcome $n^m_s$ of each shot $s$ in some set $\mathcal{S}$, we obtain a set of fermionic configurations $\{n^m_s\!:\!s\in\mathcal{S}\}$.  Given this set, we can then approximate the expectation value of a function $f(n)$ with the arithmetic mean, yielding
\begin{equation}
	\sum_{n\in\mathbb B^Q}f(n)\operatorname{P}[\hat R_m\Psi_0\!\mapsto\! n] \approx \frac{1}{S}\sum_{s\in\mathcal{S}}f(n^m_s),
	\label{e.9}
\end{equation}
where the number of shots $S=|\mathcal{S}|$ is chosen such that desired statistical accuracy is attained.

Therefore, by performing a set of measurements of $\ket{\Psi_0}$ on a QPU to produce $\{n_s\!:\!s\in\mathcal{S}\}$ and then applying the mean approximation above to the denominator in Eq.\,(\ref{e.4}), we obtain
\begin{equation}
	\braket{\Psi_0|e^{-i\hat\lambda^\dagger(\theta)}e^{i\hat\lambda(\theta)}|\Psi_0}\approx \frac{1}{S}\sum_{s\in\mathcal{S}}e^{-2\operatorname{Im}\lambda_{n_s}(\theta)},
	\label{e.10}
\end{equation}
where the summation on the right-hand side is performed on a CPU.

To calculate the corresponding expectation value in the numerator in Eq.\,(\ref{e.4}), we first decompose the Hamiltonian, which without loss of generality, can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
	\hat H=\sum_{l\in\mathcal{L}}h_l\,C_{n_l^+}^\dagger C_{n_l^-\vphantom{^+}}\vphantom{^\dagger},
	\label{e.11}
\end{equation}
where the set $\mathcal{L}$ contains the indices of all nonzero interactions, each specified by a coefficient $h_l\in\mathbb C$ and two tuples $n_l^\pm=(n_{lq}^\pm)_{q\in\mathcal{Q}}$.  For each interaction $l\in\mathcal{L}$, we can divide the index set $\mathcal{Q}$ into two complementary subsets $\mathcal Q_l=\{q\in\mathcal Q:\delta_{n_{lq}^+n_{lq}^-}=0\}$ and $\bar{\mathcal Q}_l=\mathcal Q\setminus\mathcal Q_l$, where $\delta$ is the Kronecker delta.  As only those $q\in\mathcal{Q}$ with either a creation operator $c_q^{\dagger}$ or annihilation operator $c_q$ in the interaction are placed in $\mathcal Q_l$, this division separates out the one-fermion basis states $\ket{\psi_q}$ that are coupled to others by the interaction.  Number operators $\hat n_q=c_q^{\dagger}c_q$ do not couple different states and their indices are thus placed in $\bar{\mathcal Q}_l$.  As far as the interaction $l$ goes, the one-fermion Hilbert space can therefore be decomposed as the internal direct sum $\mathcal H=\mathcal H_l\oplus\bar{\mathcal H}_l$ with the bases $\{\ket{\psi_q}\}_{q\in\mathcal Q_l}$ and $\{\ket{\psi_q}\}_{q\in\bar{\mathcal Q}_l}$ for the two subspaces $\mathcal H_l$ and $\bar{\mathcal H}_l$, respectively.  As there is no coupling between the subspaces, we can split the system into two subsystems with the representation spaces $\mathcal F_l=\mathcal F_l(\mathcal H_l)$ and $\bar{\mathcal F}_l=\bar{\mathcal F}_l(\bar{\mathcal H}_l)$, and then define the isomorphism between $\mathcal F$ and $\mathcal F_l\otimes\bar{\mathcal F}_l$ by the bijection $n\mapsto(\nu,\bar{\nu})$, denoted $\nu\bar{\nu}$ below for brevity, for all $n\in\mathbb B^Q$, where $\nu=(n_q)_{q\in\mathcal Q_l}$ and $\bar{\nu}=(n_q)_{q\in\bar{\mathcal Q}_l}$ are subfamilies of $n$.  We assume that the number of interaction terms is bound by some even power of $Q$ with the exponent being independent of the system size (e.g., $Q^4$, for systems described by two-fermion interactions).  The cardinality $Q_l=|\mathcal Q_l|$ must therefore be independent of $Q$, and consequently, only the dimension of $\bar{\mathcal F}_l$, and not that of $\mathcal F_l$, increases exponentially with the system size.

To be able to apply the measurement approach described above again, we need the state $\ket{\Psi_0}$ to only appear within modulus squares in the form shown in Eq.\,(\ref{e.8}).  This requires that we diagonalize every term in the Hamiltonian.  As each interaction $l\in\mathcal{L}$ on $\bar{\mathcal F}_l$ is already diagonal, we focus on the space $\mathcal F_l$.  From the definition of $\mathcal Q_l$, it follows that $n_{lq}^-=1-n_{lq}^+$, for all $q\in\mathcal Q_l$.  As a result, the interaction on $\mathcal F_l$ is represented by a single element on the counter diagonal.  We can thus expand this interaction in a basis $\{\hat V_m\}$ composed of $2^{Q_l}$ counter-diagonal unitary operators.  One such basis can be formed by the operators
\begin{equation}
	\hat V_m=\hat\Pi_l\bigotimes_{q\in\mathcal Q_l}^{\vphantom{}}\hat\sigma_{m_q}\bigotimes_{q\in\bar{\mathcal Q}_l}\hat\sigma_0,
	\label{e.12}
\end{equation}
on $\mathtt H^{\otimes Q}$, for all $m\in\mathcal M_l$, where $\mathcal M_l=\{x,y\}^{Q_l}$, and where $\hat\Pi_l$ is a permutation operator that places the operators in the tensor products in the correct order given by $\mathcal Q$, and $\hat\sigma_x$ and $\hat\sigma_y$, along with $\hat\sigma_z$ appearing below, are Pauli operators, and $\hat\sigma_0$ is the identity operator.  Each unitary basis operator can furthermore always be transformed such that $\hat V_m=\hat R_m^\dagger\hat D_m\hat R_m$, where $\hat R_m$ is another unitary operator and $\hat D_m$ is a diagonal unitary operator.  Because $\hat V_m$ is a tensor product, each operator can be diagonalized separately by the rotation operators
\begin{equation}
	\begin{array}{cc}
		\hat R_x=\dfrac{\hat\sigma_0+i\hat\sigma_y}{\sqrt{2}},\quad & \quad\hat R_y=\dfrac{\hat\sigma_0-i\hat\sigma_x}{\sqrt{2}},
	\end{array}
	\label{e.13}
\end{equation}
which describe single-qubit rotations around the $y$ and $x$ axes by $-\pi/2$ and $\pi/2$, respectively, so that $\hat\sigma_x=\hat R_x^\dagger\hat\sigma_z\hat R_x$ and $\hat\sigma_y=\hat R_y^\dagger\hat\sigma_z\hat R_y$, for all $q\in\mathcal Q_l$.  We thus find that one transformation of $\mathtt H^{\otimes Q}$ is given by
\begin{equation}
	\hat R_m=\hat\Pi_l\bigotimes_{q\in\mathcal Q_l}^{\vphantom{}}\hat R_x^{\delta_{m_qx}}\hat R_y^{\delta_{m_qy}}\bigotimes_{q\in\bar{\mathcal Q}_l}^{\vphantom{}}\hat\sigma_0,
	\label{e.14}
\end{equation}
for all $m\in\mathcal M_l$, and $\hat D_m=\hat D$, where
\begin{equation}
	\hat D=\hat\Pi_l\bigotimes_{q\in\mathcal Q_l}^{\vphantom{}}\hat\sigma_z\bigotimes_{q\in\bar{\mathcal Q}_l}^{\vphantom{}}\hat\sigma_0.
	\label{e.15}
\end{equation}
Now that we have decomposed the Hamiltonian in the required form, we prepare the state $\hat R_m\ket{\Psi_0}$ and perform a set of measurements on the QPU, for every $m\in\mathcal M_l$.  This produces sets of fermionic configurations $\{\nu^m_s\bar{\nu}^m_s\!:\!s\in\mathcal{S}\}$ that we then use to calculate the numerator in Eq.\,(\ref{e.4}), which we find to be
\begin{align}
	\bra{\Psi_0}e^{-i\hat\lambda^\dagger(\theta)}\hat He^{i\hat\lambda(\theta)}\ket{\Psi_0}&\approx\frac{1}{S}\sum_{l\in\mathcal L}\frac{h_l}{2^{Q_l}}\sum_{m\in\mathcal M_l}\sum_{s\in\mathcal{S}}\Upsilon_{lm\nu^m_s\bar{\nu}^m_s}\nonumber\\
	&\times e^{-i\lambda_{\nu_l^+\bar{\nu}^m_s}(\theta)}e^{i\lambda_{\nu_l^-\bar{\nu}^m_s}(\theta)},
	\label{e.16}
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
	\Upsilon_{lm\nu^m_s\bar{\nu}^m_s}=(-1)^{\Pi_{l\bar{\nu}^m_s}}\!\!\prod_{q\in\mathcal Q_l}[(-1)^{\nu_{lq}^+}i]^{\delta_{m_{q}y}}(-1)^{\nu^m_{sq}}\!\prod_{q\in\bar{\mathcal Q}_l}\!\delta_{\bar{\nu}^m_{sq}1}^{\bar{\nu}_{lq}^+}
	\label{e.17}
\end{align}
are phase factors or zero, where $\Pi_{l\bar{\nu}^m_s}$ is the number of permutations of creation and annihilation operators performed to separate the two subsystems.

	\caption{Schematic of the cascaded variational quantum eigensolver algorithm.  The QPU executes quantum circuits to generate quantum states $\hat R_m\hat U\!\ket{0}$ that when measured yield a collection of occupation numbers $(n_1, n_2, ..., n_Q)$ recorded as the tuple $n^m_s$.  Repeating the same measurements multiple times over the set of shots $\mathcal{S}$ produces sets of fermionic configurations $\{n^m_s\!:\!s\in\mathcal{S}\}$, which are passed on as input to the CPU.  The CPU uses these sets together with a generated collection of variational parameters $\theta$ to compute the expectation value of the Hamiltonian $\hat H$ for the ansatz state $\hat A(\theta)\ket{0}$.  The CPU then completes the parameter optimization to obtain the sought minimum of the energy expectation value $E(\theta)$.}
	\label{f.1}
\end{figure}
Once we have collected the needed sets of fermionic configurations $\{n_s\!:\!s\in\mathcal{S}\}$ and $\{n^m_s\!:\!s\in\mathcal{S}\}$ from the QPU, we can calculate the energy expectation value $E(\theta)$ in Eq.\,(\ref{e.4}) using Eqs.\,(\ref{e.10}), (\ref{e.16}), and (\ref{e.17}), for any collection of variational parameters $\theta$.  This lets us perform the optimization of $\theta$ in the CVQE algorithm, in contrast to other variants, using a CPU, without further involvement of the QPU, until the energy has been minimized.  See Fig.\,\ref{f.1}, for a schematic of this process.

The ansatz operator $\hat A(\theta)$ in Eq.\,(\ref{e.1}) is both general and versatile.  The generality follows from the isomorphism between the vector space of diagonal operators on $\mathbb C$ and the Fock space $\mathcal F$.  Provided a surjective function $\hat\lambda(\theta)$ and a unitary operator $\hat U$ such that all the coefficients $u_n=\braket{n|\hat U|0}\in\mathbb C$ are nonzero, any quantum state is the image of a unique diagonal operator $\hat\lambda=\hat\lambda(\theta)$ and that image is the ansatz state
\begin{equation}
	\ket{\Psi(\theta)} = \sum_{n\in\mathbb B^Q}e^{i\lambda_n(\theta)}u_n\ket{n}.
	\label{e.18}
\end{equation}
Furthermore, there exists an operator $\hat\lambda=\hat\lambda(\theta)$, for which the ansatz state is the ground state and the energy of this state, and its equivalent unit-normalized state $\ket{\tilde\Psi(\theta)}$, is given by the equality in Eq.\,(\ref{e.2}).

\begin{figure}[t]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{fig2.pdf}
	\caption{Energy expectation value for the two-fermion, spin-singlet, two-site Hubbard model.  The Hamiltonian is $\hat H=t\sum_\sigma\big(c_{0\sigma}^\dagger c_{1\sigma}+\text{h.c.}\big)+U\sum_i \hat n_{i\uparrow}\hat n_{i\downarrow}$, where $t$ and $U$ are coefficients and the indices are given by the one-fermion basis $\{\ket{0\!\uparrow},\ket{0\!\downarrow},\ket{1\!\uparrow},\ket{1\!\downarrow}\}$.  The parameter space is restricted by letting $\lambda_n\!\rightarrow i\infty$ for all fermionic configurations $n$, except for those with two fermions with zero total spin.  The normalized spin-singlet ansatz state is a linear combination of $\ket{\tilde\Psi_1}=\big(\!\ket{0110}+\ket{1001}\!\big)/\sqrt{2}$ and $\ket{\tilde\Psi_2}=\big(\!\ket{0011}+\ket{1100}\!\big)/\sqrt{2}$ and is enforced by the constraints $\lambda_{0110}\!=\!\lambda_{1001}\!=\!\lambda$  and $\lambda_{0011}\!=\!\lambda_{1100}\!=\!-\lambda$.  The parametric equation $\lambda=\lambda(\varphi,\phi)=\phi/2-i\ln\tan\big(\frac{\pi}{4}\!+\!\frac{\varphi}{2}\big)$ is defined on the parameter space $\{(\varphi,\phi)\!:\!\varphi\!\in\!(-\pi/2,\pi/2), \phi\!\in\!(-\pi,\pi]\}$.  The energy function $E(\varphi,\phi)$ for $t/U=-0.158$ is shown in color in (a) with the colorbar in (b).  The red curves trace the longitude $\phi=0$ from the state $\ket{\tilde\Psi_0}=\big(\!\ket{\tilde\Psi_1}+\ket{\tilde\Psi_2}\!\big)/\sqrt{2}$ prepared on the QPU to the ground state marked by a dot at latitude $\varphi\approx\pi$.}
	\label{f.2}
\end{figure}
In practice, however, because of limited CC resources, for a sufficiently large system, there is no feasible parametric equation $\hat\lambda=\hat\lambda(\theta)$, for which the ansatz state is a surjective function.  Therefore, we will somehow need to restrict the parameter space $\Theta$.  The ansatz form herein makes that process physically intuitive.  By letting $\lambda_n\rightarrow i\infty$, we can eliminate any Fock state $\ket{n}$ that is not in the same irreducible representation of the symmetry group on the Fock space as the ground state.  In addition, we can enforce symmetry-adapted linear combinations of Fock states by constraints on the parameter space.  See Fig.\,\ref{f.2}, for an illustration.  We can even choose our parametric equation to be function of physically motivated many-fermion operators (e.g., the double-occupancy operator in the Hubbard model).  An illustration of this approach is described in a forthcoming paper~\cite{Stenger__} that implements the Gutzwiller ansatz~\cite{Gutzwiller63} within the cascaded VQE algorithm.

Another challenge, as system sizes increase, is going to be the limited number of shots $S$.  If $S\ll2^Q$, our mean approximation of $E(\theta)$ will be independent of the majority of coordinates $\lambda_n$, and concomitantly, the associated Fock states $\ket{n}$ in the expansion of $\ket{\Psi(\theta)}$ will have its coefficients $u_ne^{i\lambda_n(\theta)}$ fixed by $\hat U$.  Therefore, the closer $\ket{\Psi(0)}=\ket{\Psi_0}$ is to the sought ground state, the better.  For a gradually refinement of the state $\ket{\Psi_0}$, we can execute the CVQE algorithm herein iteratively.  For each iteration $i\in\{0,1,...,I\}$, in this refinement algorithm, we: (i) define and implement $\hat U_i$ such that $\ket{\tilde\Psi_i(0)}=\hat U_i\ket{0}$; (ii) minimize the energy to obtain $\ket{\Psi_i(\theta)}$; (iii) normalize $\ket{\Psi_i(\theta)}$ to get $\ket{\tilde\Psi_i(\theta)}$; and (iv) let $\ket{\tilde\Psi_{i+1}(0)}=\ket{\tilde\Psi_i(\theta)}$.  Moreover, as part of each iteration, we can also redefine the parametric equation, which would allow for the exploration of new parts of the Fock space.  Even without employing this iterative algorithm, it can be useful to normalize $\ket{\Psi(\theta)}$ and then implement a new $\hat U$ for the normalized state, as this would allow the normalized, optimized ansatz state to be prepared in its entirety on the QPU, which would allow for the calculation of other observables using the QPU.

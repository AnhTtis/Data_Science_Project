    "abstract": "We present a cascaded variational quantum eigensolver algorithm that only requires the execution of a set of quantum circuits once rather than at every iteration during the parameter optimization process, thereby reducing the number of needed circuit executions. This algorithm uses a quantum processing unit to probe the needed probability mass functions and a classical processing unit perform the remaining calculations, including the energy minimization. The ansatz form does not restrict the Fock space and provides full control over the ansatz state, including the implementation of symmetry and other physically motivated constraints.",

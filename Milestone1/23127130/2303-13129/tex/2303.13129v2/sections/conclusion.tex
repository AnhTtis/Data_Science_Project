\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we introduce TOHO, the first approach to synthesizing continuous task-oriented human-object interaction motions with unseen objects. TOHO generates complete human-object motions to conduct specific tasks with the task type, the object's initial information, and the starting human status as the only inputs. We address the synthesis process in four steps: 1) we estimate the ending object position given the task type; 2) use object positions and task labels to estimate keyframe poses; 3) the motion inbetweening model then generates continuous motions to infill the keyframes; 4) apply a novel closed-form object motion estimation algorithm to produce an object motion consistent to the human motion. The evaluation results show our framework can generate natural and realistic motions, and our generated motions are continuous, allowing for arbitrary upsampling and velocity adjustment. Future work may include generating interaction motions in scenes with occlusions and synthesizing physically corrected motions.

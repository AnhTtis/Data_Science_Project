\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we introduce TOHO, the first approach to synthesize continuous task-oriented human-object interaction motions with unseen objects. TOHO generates complete human-object motions to conduct specific tasks with the task type, the object initial information, and the starting human status as the only inputs. We address the synthesis process in three steps: 1) we estimate the ending object position given the task type and use object positions and task labels to estimate keyframe poses; 2) with the estimated keyframes, our motion inbetweening model generates continuous motions to infill them; 3) we then use a novel closed-form object motion estimation algorithm to produce a natural object motion consistent to the human motion. We evaluate our method qualitatively and quantitatively. The results show our framework can generate natural and realistic motions, and our generated motions are continuous, allowing for arbitrary upsampling and velocity adjustment.

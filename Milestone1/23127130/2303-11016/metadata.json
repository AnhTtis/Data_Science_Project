    "abstract": "Simulations of lattice gauge theories with tensor networks and quantum computing have so far mainly focused on staggered fermions. In this paper, we use matrix product states to study Wilson fermions in the Hamiltonian formulation and present a novel method to determine the additive mass renormalization. Focusing on the single-flavor Schwinger model as a benchmark model, we investigate the regime of a nonvanishing topological $θ$-term, which is inaccessible to conventional Monte Carlo methods. We systematically explore the dependence of the mass shift on the volume, the lattice spacing, the $θ$-parameter, and the Wilson parameter. This allows us to follow lines of constant renormalized mass, and therefore to substantially improve the continuum extrapolation of the mass gap and the electric field density. For small values of the mass, our continuum results agree with the theoretical prediction from mass perturbation theory. Going beyond Wilson fermions, our technique can also be applied to staggered fermions, and we demonstrate that the results of our approach agree with a recent theoretical prediction for the mass shift at sufficiently large volumes.",

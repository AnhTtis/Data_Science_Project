Recent years, Graph Neural Networks(GNNs) have attracted more and more research attention because of its superior performance on some graph learning tasks. Training of GNNs needs large amount of labeled data, which casts shadows on the usability and expansibility of GNNs. Inspired by recent unsupervised research on computer vision and natural language processing, we propose a novel unsupervised graph representation learning model together with several graph data augmentation methods (drop edge, blur, mask features) and a local and global graph mutual information maximization strategy. By maximize two types of mutual information between original graph and augmented graph, the model is forced to learn some useful prior domain knowledge. We conduct experiments on both node classification and graph classification tasks and show the superior performance of the proposed model over state-of-the-art baselines.},

abstract = {Summary
The impact of spontaneous movements on neuronal activity has created the need to quantify behavior. We present a versatile framework to directly capture the 3D motion of freely definable body points in a marker-free manner with high precision and reliability. Combining the tracking with neural recordings revealed multiplexing of information in the motor cortex neurons of freely moving rats. By integrating multiple behavioral variables into a model of the neural response, we derived a virtual head fixation for which the influence of specific body movements was removed. This strategy enabled us to analyze the behavior of interest (e.g., front paw movements). Thus, we unveiled an unexpectedly large fraction of neurons in the motor cortex with tuning to the paw movements, which was previously masked by body posture tuning. Once established, our framework can be efficiently applied to large datasets while minimizing the experimental workload caused by animal training and manual labeling.}

Existing 3D measurement techniques draw on specialized hardware, such as motion capture or depth cameras, as well as deep multi-view and monocular computer vision. Continued advances at the intersection of deep learning and computer vision will facilitate 3D tracking across more anatomical features, with less training data, in additional species, and within more natural, occlusive environments. 3D behavioral measurement enables unique applications in phenotyping, investigating the neural basis of behavior, and designing artificial agents capable of imitating animal behavior.}

	abstract = {The hypothalamus plays a key role in regulating innate behaviors. It is widely believed to function as a system of {\textquoteleft}labeled lines{\textquoteright}, containing behavior-specific neurons with characteristic transcriptomic and connectomic profiles. This view however fails to explain why, although activation of estrogen receptor-1 (Esr1) expressing neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvl) promotes aggression, few VMHvl neurons are tuned to attack. To address this paradox, we adopted an unsupervised dynamical systems framework to analyze population activity among VMHvlEsr1 neurons during aggression. We discovered that this activity contains an {\textquotedblleft}integration{\textquotedblright} dimension exhibiting slow-ramping dynamics and persistent activity that correlates with escalating aggressiveness. These dynamics are implemented as an approximate line attractor in state space. Our analysis suggests a function for VMHvl to encode the intensity of behavior-relevant motive states using line attractors. This view reconciles observational and perturbational studies of VMHvl, and reveals a new mode of neural computation in the hypothalamus.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

We propose two advanced solutions, namely TrajGAN and TrajVAE, which utilize LSTM to model the characteristics of trajectories first, and then take advantage of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) frameworks respectively to generate trajectories. In order of compare the similarity of existing trajectories in our dataset and the generated trajectories, we utilize multiple trajectory similarity metrics. Through several experiments, we demonstrate that our method is more accurate and stable than the baseline.}

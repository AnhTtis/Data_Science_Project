    "abstract": "We consider the set of lower-triangular, infinite matrices with natural operations such as addition, multiplication by a number or matrix multiplication. With respect to every of these operations separately, the set preserves the group structure. With respect to all three operations considered jointly, the set becomes an algebra with unity. We indicate important properties of the obtained in this way algebraic structures. In particular, we indicate several sub-groups or sub-rings. Among sub-groups, we consider the group of Riordan matrices and indicate its several sub-groups. We also present many examples (in fact around 20) of such matrices composed of the sequences of important families of polynomials or numbers as entries of certain lower-triangular infinite matrices. By applying well-known matrix operations such as multiplication and calculating an inverse, we see that such representation can be and is a source of getting new, important relationships between these families.",

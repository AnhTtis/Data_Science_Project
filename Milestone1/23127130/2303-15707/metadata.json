    "abstract": "Motivation: There is accumulating evidence showing the important roles of bacteriophages (phages) in regulating the structure and functions of microbiome. However, lacking an easy-to-use and integrated phage analysis software hampers microbiome-related research from incorporating phages in the analysis.\n  Results: In this work, we developed a web server, PhaBOX, to comprehensively identify and analyze phage contigs in metagenomic data. To our best knowledge, this is the first web server that supports integrated phage analysis, including detecting phage contigs from the metagenomic assembly, lifestyle prediction, taxonomic classification, and host prediction. Instead of treating the algorithms as a black box, PhaBOX also supports visualization of the essential features for making predictions. With the user-friendly graphical interface, users with or without informatics training can easily use the web server for analyzing phages in microbiome data.\n  Availability: The web server of PhaBOX is available via: https://phage.ee.cityu.edu.hk. The source code of PhaBOX is available via: https://github.com/KennthShang/PhaBOX",

    "abstract": "Magnetic skyrmions are magnetic quasi-particles with enhanced stability and different manipulation mechanisms using external fields and currents making them promising candidates for future applications for instance in neuromorphic computing. Recently, several measurements and simulations have shown that thermally activated skyrmions in confined geometries, as they are necessary for device applications, arrange themselves predominantly based on commensurability effects. In this simulational study, based on the Thiele model, we investigate the enhanced dynamics and degenerate non-equilibrium steady state of a system in which the intrinsic skyrmion-skyrmion and skyrmion-boundary interaction compete with thermal fluctuations as well as current-induced spin-orbit torques. The investigated system is a triangular-shaped confinement geometry hosting four skyrmions, where we inject spin-polarized currents between two corners of the structure. We coarse-grain the skyrmion states in the system to analyze the intricacies of skyrmion arrangements of the skyrmion ensemble. In the context of neuromorphic computing, such methods address the key challenge of optimizing read-out positions in confined geometries and form the basis to understand collective skyrmion dynamics in systems with competing interactions on different scales.",

    "abstract": "A determination of the jet energy scale is presented using proton$-$proton collision data with a centre-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 140 fb$^{-1}$ collected using the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Jets are reconstructed using the ATLAS particle-flow method that combines charged-particle tracks and topo-clusters formed from energy deposits in the calorimeter cells. The anti-$k_{t}$ jet algorithm with radius parameter $R=0.4$ is used to define the jet. Novel jet energy scale calibration strategies developed for the LHC Run 2 are reported that lay the foundation for the jet calibration in Run 3. Jets are calibrated with a series of simulation-based corrections, including state-of-the-art techniques in jet calibration such as machine learning methods and novel $\\textit{in situ}$ calibrations to achieve better performance than the baseline calibration derived using up to 81 fb$^{-1}$ of Run 2 data. The performance of these new techniques is then examined in the $\\textit{in situ}$ measurements by exploiting the transverse momentum balance between a jet and a reference object. The $b$-quark jet energy scale using particle flow jets is measured for the first time with around 1% precision using $γ$+jet events.",

abstract="An external Human-Machine-Interface (eHMI) signaling the vehicle's intended movements facilitates pedestrians' encounters with self-driving vehicles (SDV). However, there is no standard for automated driving system (ADS) lamps today. This study compares the efficacy of a steady, a flashing and a sweeping light signal to communicate an SDV's intention to yield. The eHMI designs were evaluated at an unsignalized intersection with participants crossing in front of a yielding Wizard-of-Oz SDV. We analyzed crossing behavior and conducted questionnaires and structured interviews with N = 30 participants to identify eHMI design recommendations. Our research provides evidence that a steady and a flashing signal facilitate user experience, learnability and likeability more than a sweeping light. With a flashing signal, pedestrians tend to cross sooner compared to a sweeping signal, and thus improving traffic flow. Design adjustments to the present signals are proposed. This paper provides guidance in the development of a standardized yielding light signal.",

abstract="To analyze the influence of right of way and automated vehicle (AV) deceleration maneuvers on pedestrians' behavior, a virtual reality study was conducted. Participants were asked to press a button when they understood the intention of an approaching AV, and to rate the driving behavior after each trial. Results showed that the AV's driving behavior was able to communicate an intention. If the AV decelerates for pedestrians, it should decelerate early. When right of way is not defined, the AV should adapt to the expectations of pedestrians (e.g. not drive too fast). At a zebra crossing, participants expect the AV to communicate at an early stage that they are allowed to go first.",

More importantly, how will mobility itself change as these independent operational vehicles first share and then dominate our roadways? How will the public be kept apprised of their evolving capacities, and what will be the impact of science and the communication of scientific advances across the varying forms of social media on these developments?

ABSTRACT={While traffic signals, signs, and road markings provide explicit guidelines for those operating in and around the roadways, some decisions, such as determinations of “who will go first,” are made by implicit negotiations between road users. In such situations, pedestrians are today often dependent on cues in drivers' behavior such as eye contact, postures, and gestures. With the introduction of more automated functions and the transfer of control from the driver to the vehicle, pedestrians cannot rely on such non-verbal cues anymore. To study how the interaction between pedestrians and automated vehicles (AVs) might look like in the future, and how this might be affected if AVs were to communicate their intent to pedestrians, we designed an external vehicle interface called automated vehicle interaction principle (AVIP) that communicates vehicles' mode and intent to pedestrians. The interaction was explored in two experiments using a Wizard of Oz approach to simulate automated driving. The first experiment was carried out at a zebra crossing and involved nine pedestrians. While it focused mainly on assessing the usability of the interface, it also revealed initial indications related to pedestrians' emotions and perceived safety when encountering an AV with/without the interface. The second experiment was carried out in a parking lot and involved 24 pedestrians, which enabled a more detailed assessment of pedestrians' perceived safety when encountering an AV, both with and without the interface. For comparison purposes, these pedestrians also encountered a conventional vehicle. After a short training course, the interface was deemed easy for the pedestrians to interpret. The pedestrians stated that they felt significantly less safe when they encountered the AV without the interface, compared to the conventional vehicle and the AV with the interface. This suggests that the interface could contribute to a positive experience and improved perceived safety in pedestrian encounters with AVs – something that might be important for general acceptance of AVs. As such, this topic should be further investigated in future studies involving a larger sample and more dynamic conditions.}

This chapter illustrates the use of reading time measures. The time measures sum fixation durations to gain an understanding of the difficulty experienced while reading texts. A distinction is made between two approaches to sum the duration of fixations. The first approach is to sum the duration of fixations which neighbor each other in a specified region of space. The second approach is to sum fixations that occur in a sequence over a specified period of time. It is argued that both types of reading time measures are needed if the experimenter is to understand the time course of the influence of a linguistic variable on readers' processing of text. Primarily, a number of hypothetical eye movement records are discussed to illustrate the differential sensitivities of different eye movement measures. An eye movement experiment investigates how people process reduced relative clause sentences with and without the focus operator only to examine the utility of different reading time measures is recorded. The results show that measures summing temporally contiguous fixations can make an important contribution to the experimenters' understanding of the precise pattern of eye movements which occur when a problem is encountered in the text."

title="How can humans understand their automated cars? HMI principles, problems and solutions",
journal="Cognition, Technology {\&} Work",

month="May",
day="12",
abstract="As long as vehicles do not provide full automation, the design and function of the Human Machine Interface (HMI) is crucial for ensuring that the human ``driver'' and the vehicle-based automated systems collaborate in a safe manner. When the driver is decoupled from active control, the design of the HMI becomes even more critical. Without mutual understanding, the two agents (human and vehicle) will fail to accurately comprehend each other's intentions and actions. This paper proposes a set of design principles for in-vehicle HMI and reviews some current HMI designs in the light of those principles. We argue that in many respects, the current designs fall short of best practice and have the potential to confuse the driver. This can lead to a mismatch between the operation of the automation in the light of the current external situation and the driver's awareness of how well the automation is currently handling that situation. A model to illustrate how the various principles are interrelated is proposed. Finally, recommendations are made on how, building on each principle, HMI design solutions can be adopted to address these challenges.",

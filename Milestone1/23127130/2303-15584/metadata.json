    "abstract": "With long data sets available for asteroseismology from space missions, it is sometimes necessary to deal with time series that have large gaps. This is becoming particularly relevant for TESS, which is revisiting many fields on the sky every two years. Because solar-like oscillators have finite mode lifetimes, it has become tempting to close large gaps by shifting time stamps. Using actual data from the Kepler Mission, we show that this results in artificial structures in the power spectrum that compromise the measurements of mode frequencies and linewidths.",

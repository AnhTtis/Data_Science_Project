abstract = {ABSTRACT
Physics-informed deep learning has drawn tremendous interest in recent years to solve computational physics problems, whose basic concept is to embed physical laws to constrain/inform neural networks, with the need of less data for training a reliable model. This can be achieved by incorporating the residual of physics equations into the loss function. Through minimizing the loss function, the network could approximate the solution. In this paper, we propose a mixed-variable scheme of physics-informed neural network (PINN) for fluid dynamics and apply it to simulate steady and transient laminar flows at low Reynolds numbers. A parametric study indicates that the mixed-variable scheme can improve the PINN trainability and the solution accuracy. The predicted velocity and pressure fields by the proposed PINN approach are also compared with the reference numerical solutions. Simulation results demonstrate great potential of the proposed PINN for fluid flow simulation with a high accuracy.}

abstract = {Neural Particle Method (NPM) is a newly proposed Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) based, truly meshfree method for hydrodynamics modeling. In the NPM, PINN is applied to globally approximate field variables, and the high-order Implicit Runge–Kutta (IRK) method is used to treat the time integration. The NPM can easily achieve incompressibility and deal with the free-surface problem. However, the NPM is currently limited to inviscid hydrodynamics problems and is computationally expensive. In this work, we developed a general NPM (gNPM) for viscous hydrodynamics modeling. In the gNPM, a single pressure is output as the predicted pressure field rather than the multiple pressures in the original NPM. Thus, the size of the neural network is greatly reduced, making the gNPM computationally more efficient. Besides, the spatial derivatives in the governing equations are calculated with respect to the current spatial coordinates rather than the predicted space. In this manner, the gNPM is more straightforward to be implemented. Furthermore, by considering the viscous term in the conservation of momentum, the gNPM can be applied for viscous hydrodynamics modeling. The effectiveness and robustness of the gNPM have been demonstrated through several hydrodynamics benchmark cases with different boundary conditions. We highlight that the proposed gNPM is able to cope with highly uneven particle distributions, while the traditional meshfree method can produce severe failure.}

abstract = {We extend the ability of an unitary quantum circuit by interfacing it with a classical autoregressive neural network. The combined model parametrizes a variational density matrix as a classical mixture of quantum pure states, where the autoregressive network generates bitstring samples as input states to the quantum circuit. We devise an efficient variational algorithm to jointly optimize the classical neural network and the quantum circuit to solve quantum statistical mechanics problems. One can obtain thermal observables such as the variational free energy, entropy, and specific heat. As a byproduct, the algorithm also gives access to low energy excitation states. We demonstrate applications of the approach to thermal properties and excitation spectra of the quantum Ising model with resources that are feasible on near-term quantum computers.}

journal = {Journal of Physics G: Nuclear and Particle Physics},
abstract = {One of the problems in the analysis of nucleus–nucleus collisions is to get information on the value of the impact parameter b. This work consists in the application of pattern recognition techniques aimed at associating values of b to groups of events. To this end, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier is adopted to analyse multifragmentation reactions. This method allows us to backtrace the values of b through a particular multidimensional analysis. The SVM classification consists of two main phases. In the first one, known as the training phase, the classifier learns to discriminate events that are generated by a model. In this case we used a classical molecular dynamics (CMD) model for the reaction: 58Ni + 48Ca at 25 A MeV. To check the classification of events in the second one, known as the test phase, what has been learned is tested on new events generated by the same model. These new results have been compared to those obtained through others techniques of backtracing the impact parameter (estimate function of b and PCA analysis). This approach better classifies central and peripheral collisions with respect to other techniques. We have finally performed the SVM classification on the experimental data measured by the NUCL-EX Collaboration with CHIMERA apparatus for the previous reaction and we show some results of the method.}

This way of combining individual “expert” models makes it hard to generate samples from the combined model but easy to infer the values of the latent variables of each expert, because the combination rule ensures that the latent variables of different experts are conditionally independent when given the data. A product of experts (PoE) is therefore an interesting candidate for a perceptual system in which rapid inference is vital and generation is unnecessary. Training a PoE by maximizing the likelihood of the data is difficult because it is hard even to approximate the derivatives of the renormalization term in the combination rule. Fortunately, a PoE can be trained using a different objective function called “contrastive divergence” whose derivatives with regard to the parameters can be approximated accurately and efficiently. Examples are presented of contrastive divergence learning using several types of expert on several types of data.}",

abstract = {Tree boosting is a highly effective and widely used machine learning method. In this paper, we describe a scalable end-to-end tree boosting system called XGBoost, which is used widely by data scientists to achieve state-of-the-art results on many machine learning challenges. We propose a novel sparsity-aware algorithm for sparse data and weighted quantile sketch for approximate tree learning. More importantly, we provide insights on cache access patterns, data compression and sharding to build a scalable tree boosting system. By combining these insights, XGBoost scales beyond billions of examples using far fewer resources than existing systems.},

abstract = {We show that standard multilayer feedforward networks with as few as a single hidden layer and arbitrary bounded and nonconstant activation function are universal approximators with respect to Lp(μ) performance criteria, for arbitrary finite input environment measures μ, provided only that sufficiently many hidden units are available. If the activation function is continuous, bounded and nonconstant, then continuous mappings can be learned uniformly over compact input sets. We also give very general conditions ensuring that networks with sufficiently smooth activation functions are capable of arbitrarily accurate approximation to a function and its derivatives.}

The issues leading to undesirable and unpredicted emergent behavior are set in place during the phases of creation and production and realized during the operational phase, with many of those problematic issues due to human interaction. We propose that the idea of the Digital Twin, which links the physical system with its virtual equivalent can mitigate these problematic issues. We describe the Digital Twin concept and its development, show how it applies across the product lifecycle in defining and understanding system behavior, and define tests to evaluate how we are progressing. We discuss how the Digital Twin relates to Systems Engineering and how it can address the human interactions that lead to ``normal accidents.'' We address both Digital Twin obstacles and opportunities, such as system replication and front running. We finish with NASA's current work with the Digital Twin.},

The procedure repeatedly adjusts the weights of the connections in the network so as to minimize a measure of the difference between the actual output vector of the net and the desired output vector. As a result of the weight adjustments, internal `hidden'units which are not part of the input or output come to represent important features of the task domain, and the regularities in the task are captured by the interactions of these units. The ability to create useful new features distinguishes back-propagation from earlier, simpler methods such as the perceptron-convergence procedure1.},

ABSTRACT = {The beam interruptions (interlocks) of particle accelerators, despite being necessary safety measures, lead to abrupt operational changes and a substantial loss of beam time. A novel time series classification approach is applied to decrease beam time loss in the High-Intensity Proton Accelerator complex by forecasting interlock events. The forecasting is performed through binary classification of windows of multivariate time series. The time series are transformed into Recurrence Plots which are then classified by a Convolutional Neural Network, which not only captures the inner structure of the time series but also uses the advances of image classification techniques. Our best-performing interlock-to-stable classifier reaches an Area under the ROC Curve value of 0.71±0.01 compared to 0.65±0.01 of a Random Forest model, and it can potentially reduce the beam time loss by 0.5±0.2 s per interlock.},

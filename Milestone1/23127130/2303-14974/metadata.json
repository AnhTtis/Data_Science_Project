    "abstract": "I discuss empty space, as it appears in the physical foundations of relativistic field theories and in the semiclassical study of isolated systems. Of particular interest is the relationship between empirical measurements of the cosmological constant and the question of appropriate representation of empty space by spacetimes, or models of general relativity. Also considered is a speculative move that shows up in one corner of quantum gravity research. In pursuit of holographic quantum cosmology given a positive cosmological constant, there is evidently some freedom available for theoretical physicists to pick between two physically inequivalent spacetime representations of empty space, moving forward: de Sitter spacetime or its 'elliptic' cousin.",

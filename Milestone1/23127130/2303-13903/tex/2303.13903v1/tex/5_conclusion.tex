\section{Conclusion and Outlook}%
\label{sec:conclusion_and_outlook}

This paper proposed an SDN-based network control scheme for \ac{SOME/IP} \ac{SD}.
We designed an \ac{SDN} controller application that fully supports \ac{SOME/IP} \ac{SD}, while remaining transparent to existing \ac{SOME/IP} implementations.
The controller detects available service instances and automatically sets up paths in forwarding devices for acknowledged subscriptions.

We evaluated the performance of our approach in a simulation-based study, comparing its scalability to non-optimized SDN and standard Ethernet switching. 
Our approach improved the SDN performance by up to 50\% compared to the non-optimized SDN solution.
The central controller processing all \ac{SOME/IP} \ac{SD} messages significantly reduces SDN performance, but the additional delay only affects subscription setup time, not the actual data transfer.
Our approach achieves a setup time below \SI{10}{\milli\second} for 2500 subscriptions, complying with the fastest service availability normally required in a vehicle, which is about \SI{200}{\milli\second}.

We explored various potentials and extensions of a \ac{SOME/IP} \ac{SD}-aware \ac{SDN} controller. 
Future work will focus on further optimizing service discovery, mobility, and reconfiguration mechanisms for improved robustness, QoS support, and security enhancements.

    "abstract": "All-dielectric optical metasurfaces can locally control the amplitude and phase of light at the nanoscale, enabling arbitrary wavefront shaping. However, lack of post-fabrication tunability has limited the true potential of metasurfaces for many applications. Here, we utilize a thin liquid crystal (LC) layer as a tunable medium surrounding the metasurface to achieve a phase-only spatial light modulator (SLM) with high reflection in the visible frequency, exhibiting an active and continuous resonance tuning with associated 2pi phase control and uncoupled amplitude. Dynamic wavefront shaping is demonstrated by programming 96 individually addressable electrodes with a small pixel pitch of ~1 um. The small pixel size is facilitated by the reduced LC thickness, strongly suppressing crosstalk among pixels. This device is used to demonstrate dynamic beam steering with wide field-of-view and high absolute diffraction efficiencies. We believe that our demonstration may pave the way towards realizing next generation, high-resolution SLMs, with wide applications in dynamic holography, tunable optics and light detection and ranging (LiDAR), to mention a few.",

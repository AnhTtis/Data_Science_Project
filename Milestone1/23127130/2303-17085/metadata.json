    "abstract": "We numerically investigate photo-responses of the charge ordered state upon stimuli of pulsed laser light, especially paying attention to the differences in the pulse width, whose shortness has been a key to experimentally realize large photo-induced effects. As a model for charge ordering, we consider an interacting spinless fermion model on a one-dimensional chain coupled to classical phonons and numerically simulate its real-time dynamics. First, we demonstrate the case where spatially uniform dynamics take place, and show the delayed response of phonons after the photo-irradiation causing destabilization of charge order. When a local impurity potential is introduced in the initial state, an inhomogeneous charge order melting occurs and the delay in the time scale also happens in the real space melting process. Finally, by investigating wider parameter ranges using different pulse widths, we find that the use of ultrashort pulses considerably expands the frequency window for charge order melting; it is indispensable in realizing the photo-induced phase transition with off-resonant conditions.",

    "abstract": "The unit value of a commodity that Michio Morishima's method and its variations enable to determine correctly, is the sum of the value of the commodities it contains (inputs) and the quantity of labor required for its production. However, goods are sold at their market production price only when they meet a solvent social need that involves the entire economy with its interconnections between the different industrial sectors. This condition gives full meaning to Marx's fundamental equalities, which derive from the law of value and constitute invariants that apply to the economy as a whole. These equalities are necessary to determine market production prices. We demonstrate that they also enable to solve the transformation problem for a simple reproduction system without fixed capital by starting from Morishima's formalism and returning to a formalism closer to that used by Marx.",

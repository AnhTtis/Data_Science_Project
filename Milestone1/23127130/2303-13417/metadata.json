    "abstract": "We investigate a symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) Fisher information for kinetic uncertainty relations (KURs) of open quantum systems described by the GKSL quantum master equation with and without the detailed balance condition. In a quantum kinetic uncertainty relation derived by Vu and Saito [Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 140602 (2022)], the Fisher information of probability of quantum trajectory with a time-rescaling parameter plays an essential role. This Fisher information is upper bounded by the SLD Fisher information. For a finite time and arbitrary initial state, we derive a concise expression of the SLD Fisher information, which is a double time integral and can be calculated by solving coupled first-order differential equations. We also derive a simple lower bound of the Fisher information of quantum trajectory. We point out that the SLD Fisher information also appears in the speed limit based on the Mandelstam-Tamm relation by Hasegawa [arXiv:2203.12421v4]. When the jump operators connect eigenstates of the system Hamiltonian, we show that the Bures angle in the interaction picture is upper bounded by the square root of the dynamical activity at short times, which contrasts with the classical counterpart.",

    "abstract": "The distinguishing chromatic number of a graph $G$ is the smallest number of colors needed to properly color the vertices of $G$ so that the trivial automorphism is the only symmetry of $G$ that preserves the coloring. We investigate the distinguishing chromatic number for Hamiltonian circulant graphs with maximum degree at most 4.",

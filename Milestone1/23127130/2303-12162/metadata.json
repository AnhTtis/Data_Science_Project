    "abstract": "We determine filtering and master equations for a quantum system interacting with wave packet of light in a continuous-mode squeezed number state. We formulate the problem of conditional evolution of a quantum system making use of model of repeated interactions and measurements. In this approach the quantum system undergoes a sequence of interactions with an environment defined by a chain of harmonic oscillators. We assume that the environment is prepared in an entangled state being a discrete analogue of a continuous-mode number state. We present a derivation of a discrete stochastic dynamics that depends on the results of measurement performed on the field after its interaction with the system. In this paper we consider a photon counting measurement scheme. By taking a continuous time limit, we finally obtain differential stochastic equations for the system. Analytical formulae for quantum trajectories and exclusive probability densities that allow to fully characterize the statistics of photons in the output field are given.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces VR Haptics at Home, a method of repurposing everyday\nobjects in the home to provide casual and on-demand haptic experiences. Current\nVR haptic devices are often expensive, complex, and unreliable, which limits\nthe opportunities for rich haptic experiences outside research labs. In\ncontrast, we envision that, by repurposing everyday objects as passive haptics\nprops, we can create engaging VR experiences for casual uses with minimal cost\nand setup. To explore and evaluate this idea, we conducted an in-the-wild study\nwith eight participants, in which they used our proof-of-concept system to turn\ntheir surrounding objects such as chairs, tables, and pillows at their own\nhomes into haptic props. The study results show that our method can be adapted\nto different homes and environments, enabling more engaging VR experiences\nwithout the need for complex setup process. Based on our findings, we propose a\npossible design space to showcase the potential for future investigation.",

  abstract = {The performance is investigated of a multichannel feedforward headrest system for the active control of interior road noise around a listener's ears in a vehicle cabin. An active headrest system is combined with the remote microphone technique so that direct measurement of the error signals at the listener's ears are not necessary. The formulation of the optimal observation filter for the remote microphone technique and the optimal controller for active control is presented in the time domain, to sense and control broadband random road noise. The estimation accuracy of the remote microphone technique is investigated through simulations, using the signals measured at a number of monitoring microphones and error microphones in the cabin of a large SUV. It is shown that disturbances at the virtual error microphones can be accurately estimated by a causal observation filter. The attenuation performance of the active headrest system using the remote microphone technique is also predicted offline, using measured plant responses, disturbance signals and reference signals, which shows that several peaks in the spectrum of the road noise can be reduced at frequencies of up to 1 kHz. The effects of delays and head movements on the attenuation performance are also studied.},

Robust performance of adaptive feedforward control algorithms incorporating such virtual sensing techniques is essential to achieving noise attenuation at the designated locations in practice, when subject to uncertainties in the control environment. Off-line simulations using the data measured with a headrest ANC system in a running car are initially conducted, to evaluate the performance of the two virtual sensing methods under practical conditions. The differences between the two methods are further studied by using an analytical model and numerical simulations of the headrest ANC system. It is shown that in general the additional-filter method is sensitive to uncertainties in the properties of the reference signals used for feedforward control, whereas the remote-microphone method is sensitive to changes in the plant responses related to the monitoring microphones. This study, therefore, can be used to guide the choice of virtual sensing methods in different applications.},

Conventionally, spatial ANC is achieved by using complex error microphone arrays such as grid or spherical geometry, which are impractical and obstruct the users to enter the quiet region. Recently, the remote microphone technique has been introduced to spatial ANC systems without using error microphones inside the region of interest. However, this technique still requires an error microphone array during the tuning stage. In this paper, we further improve the remote microphone technique by introducing a spatial sound field recording method with a moving higher order microphone for the noise field recording (tuning stage) as well as secondary channel estimations (control stage). This eliminates the requirement for impractical microphone array geometries, typically required in existing spatial ANC solutions. The experimental data based simulation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method on noise reduction over space with its feasible array design.},

The proposed ANC system can reduce narrowband noise while improving the noise reduction ability at the desired locations. A headmounted ANC system based on an adaptive feedback structure can reduce noise with periodicity or narrowband components. However, since quiet zones are formed only at the locations of error microphones, an adequate noise reduction cannot be achieved at the locations where error microphones cannot be placed such as near the eardrums. A solution to this problem is to apply a virtual sensing technique. A virtual sensing ANC system can achieve higher noise reduction at the desired locations by measuring the system models from physical sensors to virtual sensors, which will be used in the online operation of the virtual sensing ANC algorithm. Hence, we attempt to achieve the maximum noise reduction near the eardrums by applying the virtual sensing technique to the head-mounted ANC system. However, it is impossible to place the microphone near the eardrums. Therefore, the system models from physical sensors to virtual sensors are estimated using the Head And Torso Simulator (HATS) instead of human ears. Some simulation, experimental, and subjective assessment results demonstrate that the headmounted ANC system with virtual sensing is superior to that without virtual sensing in terms of the noise reduction ability at the desired locations.},

As the frequency range is extended, however, the uncertainties in the acoustic responses become more significant, and the design of multichannel adaptive controllers that are robustly stable to these uncertainties becomes more important. In order to fully characterise the uncertainties, a very large number of measurements would, in principle, need to be taken, due to the combination of all the possible changes in the acoustic environment. For uncertainties due to the simultaneous change in position of several objects within the acoustic environment, however, it is shown that the uncertainties can be accurately predicted by the superposition of these uncertainties, due to the change in position of the objects individually. This allows the uncertainty that is due to the change in position of a number of objects to be rapidly evaluated from a limited number of experiments and considerably simplifies the controller design process, which is illustrated here for an active headrest system using two different virtual sensing techniques.},

A general formulation is presented for the optimum controller in an active system for local sound control in a spatially random primary field. The sound field in a control region is selectively attenuated using secondary sources, driven by reference sensors, all of which are potentially remote from this control region. It is shown that the optimal controller is formed of the combination of a least-squares estimation of the primary source signals from the reference signals, and a least-squares controller driven by the primary source signals themselves. The optimum controller is also calculated using the remote microphone technique, in both the frequency and the time domains. The sound field under control is assumed to be stationary and generated by an array of primary sources, whose source strengths are specified using a spectral density matrix. This can easily be used to synthesize a diffuse primary field, if the primary sources are uncorrelated and far from the control region, but can also generate primary fields dominated by contributions from a particular direction, for example, which is shown to significantly affect the shape of the resulting zone of quiet.},

The resulting zone of quiet is generally limited in size and this requires the physical error sensor be placed at the desired location of attenuation, which is often inconvenient. To overcome this, a number of virtual sensing algorithms have been developed for active noise control. Using the physical error signal, the control signal and knowledge of the system, these virtual sensing algorithms estimate the error signal at a location that is remote from the physical error sensor, referred to as the virtual location. Instead of minimising the physical error signal, the estimated error signal is minimised with the active noise control system to generate a zone of quiet at the virtual location. This paper will review a number of virtual sensing algorithms developed for active noise control. Additionally, the performance of these virtual sensing algorithms in numerical simulations and in experiments is discussed and compared. \textcopyright{} 2008 by the authors.},

  abstract = {For active noise control systems in an open aperture application, virtual sensing system is often needed to overcome design constraint in terms of microphone placement. The virtual sensing system, however, make assumptions to the acoustical field and thus is highly sensitive to any changes in the primary field. Taking the window aperture ANC application for example, incoming disturbance signals could impinge from multiple locations, altering the spatial correlation between the physical and virtual microphones. For instance, in the context of a high-rise apartment window, aircraft noise would propagate downwards from the sky, whereas traffic noise propagate upward from the ground. This paper considers the estimation performance of the remote microphone technique, an example of a virtual sensing method, in an open aperture application when faced with changes in the primary noise source. Additionally, this paper introduces a new method for estimating the spectral density due to multiple sources through the incoherent decomposition method. It has been shown experimentally that this algorithm is able to improve the nearfield estimation of the system.},

In this article, we firstly improve the forward model of acoustic power propagation by considering background noises at the sensor array, and the propagation uncertainty caused by wind tunnel effects. We then propose a robust super-resolution approach via sparsity constraint for acoustic imaging in strong background noises. The sparsity parameter is adaptively derived from the sparse distribution of source powers. The proposed approach can jointly reconstruct source powers and positions, as well as the background noise power. Our approach is compared with the conventional beamforming, deconvolution and sparse regularization methods by simulated, wind tunnel data and hybrid data respectively. It is feasible to apply the proposed approach for effectively mapping monopole sources in wind tunnel tests.},

  abstract = {Acoustic inverse methods, based on the output of an array of microphones, can be readily applied to the characterisation of acoustic sources that can be adequately modelled as a number of discrete monopoles. However, there are many situations, particularly in the fields of vibroacoustics and aeroacoustics, where the sources are distributed continuously in space over a finite area (or volume). This paper is concerned with the practical problem of applying inverse methods to such distributed source regions via the process of spatial sampling. The problem is first tackled using computer simulations of the errors associated with the application of spatial sampling to a wide range of source distributions. It is found that the spatial sampling criterion for minimising the errors in the radiated far-field reconstructed from the discretised source distributions is strongly dependent on acoustic wavelength but is only weakly dependent on the details of the source field itself. The results of the computer simulations are verified experimentally through the application of the inverse method to the sound field radiated by a ducted fan. The un-baffled fan source with the associated flow field is modelled as a set of equivalent monopole sources positioned on the baffled duct exit along with a matrix of complimentary non-flow Green functions. Successful application of the spatial sampling criterion involves careful frequency-dependent selection of source spacing, and results in the accurate reconstruction of the radiated sound field. Discussions of the conditioning of the Green function matrix which is inverted are included and it is shown that the spatial sampling criterion may be relaxed if conditioning techniques, such as regularisation, are applied to this matrix prior to inversion. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, it is still difficult to obtain the position and strength information of unsteady rotating loading sources in practice. In this paper, a time-domain inverse method for the localization and quantification of unsteady rotating loading sources is proposed, based on the Farassat integral solution of the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings equation with the monopole and quadrupole source terms being neglected. In this method, the analytical direct model that relates the unsteady rotating forces to the radiated sound field is first discretized, and then the unsteady rotating forces are reconstructed from the measured pressures via a timedomain inversion procedure. Different from the previous inverse aeroacoustic methods, the proposed method can reconstruct the time histories of the three components of the unsteady rotating forces in the Cartesian coordinate system, thereby accurately locating the source posi\- tions and quantitatively estimating the source strengths in a real-time way. Numerical simulations with two unsteady rotating point forces and experiments with the rotating blades of an unmanned aerial vehicle examine the validity of the proposed method.},

We describe an active sound control system fitted onto the opening of the domestic window that attenuates the incident sound, achieving a global reduction in the room interior while maintaining natural ventilation. The incident sound is actively attenuated by an array of control modules (a small loudspeaker) distributed optimally across the aperture. A single reference microphone provides advance information for the controller to compute the anti-noise signal input to the loudspeakers in real-time. A numerical analysis revealed that the maximum active attenuation potential outperforms the perfect acoustic insulation provided by a fully shut single-glazed window in ideal conditions. To determine the real-world performance of such an active control system, an experimental system is realized in the aperture of a full-sized window installed on a mockup room. Up to 10-dB reduction in energy-averaged sound pressure level was achieved by the active control system in the presence of a recorded real-world broadband noise. However, attenuation in the low-frequency range and its maximum power output is limited by the size of the loudspeakers.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a systematic comparison of several prominent beamforming algorithms developed for aeroacoustic measurements. The most widely used delay-and-sum (DAS) beamformer is known to suffer from high sidelobe level and low resolution problems. Therefore, more advanced methods, in particular the deconvolution approach for the mapping of acoustic sources (DAMAS), sparsity constrained DAMAS (SC-DAMAS), covariance matrix fitting (CMF) and CLEAN based on spatial source coherence (CLEAN-SC), have been considered to achieve improved resolution and more accurate signal power estimates. The performances of the aforementioned algorithms are evaluated via experiments involving a 63-element logarithmic spiral microphone array in the presence of a single source, two incoherent sources with similar strengths and with different strengths, and two coherent sources. It is observed that DAMAS, SCDAMAS and CMF provide the most reliable source location estimates, even at relatively low frequencies. Furthermore, the integrated levels obtained with the array processing algorithms are shown to agree with what a single reference microphone placed at the center of the array measures when the array is appropriately calibrated. It is also shown that, as expected, the aforementioned algorithms are unsuccessful in distinguishing coherent acoustic sources unless the frequency is relatively high. DAS and CLEAN-SC are shown to be around 2 to 90 times faster than the other three algorithms.},

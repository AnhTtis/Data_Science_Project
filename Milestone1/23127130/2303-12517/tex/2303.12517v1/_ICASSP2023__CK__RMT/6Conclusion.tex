Although the remote microphone technique is sensitive to changes in the primary acoustic field, it can be reconstructed in real-time implementation through source decomposition as shown previously. The effect of the source ratio parameter on the estimation performance, however, is yet to be studied. In this paper, we have demonstrated the significance of the source ratio parameter when performing the RMT through source decomposition, as a large mismatch in the source ratio will cause a degradation of the estimation. Thus, we proposed a source-tracking algorithm by matching the CM directly and then iterating the source ratio parameter through gradient descent. To verify our algorithm, simulations with physical measurements from an open-aperture setup were conducted. Simulation results showed a good convergence when estimating the source ratio using the proposed algorithm, and thus can be used to reconstruct the observation filter in real-time implementation.

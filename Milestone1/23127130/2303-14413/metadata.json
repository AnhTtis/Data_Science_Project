    "abstract": "Exact solutions to an Einstein-Maxwell(E-D-M) system with an electric current are simple models of global cosmic magnetic phenomena in the universe. In this paper, we consider an E-D-M system with two chiral spinors $ ψ^\\pm$ coupled with a gauge field $ A$ and an electromagnetic field $F=dA$. We construct a family of exact solutions to the E-D-M system on four-dimensional static Sasakian spacetimes. The electromagnetic field in the solutions is a contact magnetic field, and the chiral spinors are induced from Sasakian quasi-Killing spinors. We find closed universe models whose weak energy condition holds and open universe models whose weak energy condition is violated. In this study, we introduce the Sasakian frame, which is used to prospectively discuss the properties of Sasakian quasi-Killing spinors. A simple description of Sasakian quasi-Killing spinors of a certain type is obtained.",

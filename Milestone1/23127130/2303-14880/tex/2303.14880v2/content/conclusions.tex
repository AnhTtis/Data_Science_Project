\section{CONCLUSIONS}
\label{sec::conclusions}
We present a large-scale, multi-modal, social human navigation dataset, MuSoHu, to allow robots to learn human-like, socially compliant navigation behaviors. Our open-sourced hardware and software design allows our portable sensor suite to be easily replicated and used to collect social human navigation data in a variety of public spaces worldwide. Such an easy access to a variety of natural social navigation interactions in human-inhabited public spaces in the wild is shown in our preliminary experiments to be useful to learn social robot navigation. We point out future anticipated use cases and research directions of MuSoHu to develop socially compliant robot navigation.

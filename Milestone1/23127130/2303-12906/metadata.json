    "abstract": "This paper defines compatible BiHom-Lie algebras by twisting the compatible Lie algebras by two linear commuting maps. We show the characterization of compatible BiHom-Lie algebra as a Maurer-Cartan element in a suitable bidifferential graded Lie algebra. We also define a cohomology theory for compatible BiHom-Lie algebras.",

    "abstract": "We prove that there exists a constant $c_0$ such that for any $t \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and any $n\\geq c_0 t$, if $A \\subset S_n$ is a $t$-intersecting family of permutations then$|A|\\leq (n-t)!$. Furthermore, if $|A|\\ge 0.75(n-t)!$ then there exist $i_1,\\ldots,i_t$ and $j_1,\\ldots,j_t$ such that $σ(i_1)=j_1,\\ldots,σ(i_t)=j_t$ holds for any $σ\\in A$. This shows that the conjectures of Deza and Frankl (1977) and of Cameron (1988) on $t$-intersecting families of permutations hold for all $t \\leq c_0 n$. Our proof method, based on hypercontractivity for global functions, does not use the specific structure of permutations, and applies in general to $t$-intersecting sub-families of `pseudorandom' families in $\\{1,2,\\ldots,n\\}^n$, like $S_n$.",

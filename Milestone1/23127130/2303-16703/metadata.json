    "abstract": "We study arithmetic properties of certain quaternionic periods of Hilbert modular forms arising from base change of elliptic modular forms. These periods which we call the distinguished periods are closely related to the notion of distinguished representation that appear in work of Harder--Langlands--Rapoport, Lai, Flicker--Hakim on the Tate conjectures for the Hilbert--Blumenthal surfaces and their quaternionic analogues. In particular, we prove an integrality result on the ratio of the distinguished period and the quaternionic Peterson norm associated to the modular form. Our method is based on an Euler system argument initiated by Flach by producing elements in the motivic cohomologies of the quaternionic Hilbert--Blumenthal surfaces with control of their ramification behaviours. We show that these periods give natural bounds for certain subspaces of the Selmer groups of these quaternionic Hilbert--Blumenthal surfaces. The lengths of these subspaces can be determined by using the Taylor--Wiles method and can be related to the quaternionic Peterson norms of the modular forms.",

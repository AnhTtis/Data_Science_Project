    "abstract": "Answering Vershik's question we show that quasi-similarity does not conserve the entropy, proving quasi-similarity of all Bernoulli actions of a countable infinite group. We prove also the following generalization of Pinsker's theorem: the actions with zero Kirillov-Kushnirenko $P$-entropy and the actions with completely positive $P$-entropy are disjoint. Poisson suspensions are used as examples.",

    "abstract": "We prove a stochastic homogenization result for integral functionals defined on finite partitions assuming the surface tension to be stationary and possibly ergodic. We also consider the convergence of boundary value problems when we impose a boundary value just on part of the boundary. As a consequence, we show that if the homogenized surface tension is isotropic, then one can obtain it by a multi-cell problem where Dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed only at the bottom and the top of the cube. We also show that this result fails in the general anisotropic case.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we propose the application of non-Hermitian photonic crystals (PCs) with anisotropic emissions. Unlike a ring of exceptional points (EPs) in isotropic non-Hermitian PCs, the EPs of anisotropic non-Hermitian PCs appear as lines symmetrical about the $Γ$ point. The non-Hermitian Hamiltonian indicates that the formation of EPs is related to the non-Hermitian strength. The real spectrum appears in the $Γ$Y direction and has been validated as the complex conjugate medium (CCM) by effective medium theory (EMT). But for the $Γ$X direction, EMT indicates that the effective refractive index has a large imaginary part, which forms an evanescent wave inside the PCs. Thence, coherent perfect absorber (CPA) and laser effects can be achieved in the directional emission of the $Γ$Y. The outgoing wave in the $Γ$X direction is weak, which can significantly reduce the losses and electromagnetic interference caused by the leakage waves. Furthermore, the non-Hermitian PCs enable many fascinating applications such as signal amplification, collimation, and angle sensors.",

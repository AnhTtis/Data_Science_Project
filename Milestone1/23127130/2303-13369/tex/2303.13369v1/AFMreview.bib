The AFM moments partially rotate with out-of-plane magnetic fields, producing room-temperature SMR. By manipulating the electron spins in Pt, we observe Larmor precession-induced oscillating SMR, reaffirming the spin current transport determined by the relative arrangement between the Pt electron spins and AFM moments. The use of the AFM with no net moments annihilates the magnetic proximity effect and thus confirms the SMR origination from AFM-controlled spin current transport, with significant spin mixing conductance of ∼1017m-2. Our findings provide an interesting perspective to detecting AFM moments and represent a significant step towards AFM spintroincs.},

abstract = {In solids, electronic Bloch states are formed by atomic orbitals. While it is natural to expect that orbital composition and information about Bloch states can be manipulated and transported, in analogy to the spin degree of freedom extensively studied in past decades, it has been assumed that orbital quenching by the crystal field prevents significant dynamics of orbital degrees of freedom. However, recent studies reveal that an orbital current, given by the flow of electrons with a finite orbital angular momentum, can be electrically generated and transported in wide classes of materials despite the effect of orbital quenching in the ground state. Orbital currents also play a fundamental role in the mechanisms of other transport phenomena such as spin Hall effect and valley Hall effect. Most importantly, it has been proposed that orbital currents can be used to induce magnetization dynamics, which is one of the most pivotal and explored aspects of magnetism. Here, we give an overview of recent progress and the current status of research on orbital currents. We review proposed physical mechanisms for generating orbital currents and discuss candidate materials where orbital currents are manifest. We review recent experiments on orbital current generation and transport and discuss various experimental methods to quantify this elusive object at the heart of orbitronics - an area which exploits the orbital degree of freedom as an information carrier in solid-state devices.},

The SMR is induced by the simultaneous action of spin Hall and inverse spin Hall effects and therefore a nonequilibrium proximity phenomenon. We compute the SMR in F|N and F|N|F layered systems, treating N by spin-diffusion theory with quantum mechanical boundary conditions at the interfaces in terms of the spin-mixing conductance. Our results explain the experimentally observed spin Hall magnetoresistance in N|F bilayers. For F|N|F spin valves we predict an enhanced SMR amplitude when magnetizations are collinear.

We obtain direct access to the surface magnetization of magnetoelectric antiferromagnets providing a read-out method for ferromagnet-free magnetoelectric memory. Owing to the great sensitivity, the technique bears a strong potential to address the physics of antiferromagnets. Exemplarily, we apply the method to access the criticality of the magnetic transition for an antiferromagnetic thin film. We reveal the presence of field-invariant uncompensated magnetization even in 6-nm-thin IrMn films and clearly distinguish two contributions, of which only the minor one is involved in interfacial magnetic coupling.

Using the magnetoelectric antiferromagnet Cr 2 O 3, we demonstrate reliable isothermal switching via gate voltage pulses and all-electric readout at room temperature. As no ferromagnetic component is present in the system, the writing magnetic field does not need to be pulsed for readout, allowing permanent magnets to be used. Based on our prototypes, we construct a comprehensive model of the magnetoelectric selection mechanisms in thin films of magnetoelectric antiferromagnets, revealing misfit induced ferrimagnetism as an important factor. Beyond memory applications, the AF-MERAM concept introduces a general all-electric interface for antiferromagnets and should find wide applicability in antiferromagnetic spintronics.},

It aims at reduced power consumption, increased integration density and enhanced functionality where non-volatile memory is combined with high-speed logical processing. Promising spintronic device concepts use the electric control of interface and surface magnetization. From the combination of magnetometry, spin-polarized photoemission spectroscopy, symmetry arguments and first-principles calculations, we show that the (0001) surface of magnetoelectric Cr2O3 has a roughness-insensitive, electrically switchable magnetization. Using a ferromagnetic Pd/Co multilayer deposited on the (0001) surface of a Cr2O3 single crystal, we achieve reversible, room-temperature isothermal switching of the exchange-bias field between positive and negative values by reversing the electric field while maintaining a permanent magnetic field. This effect reflects the switching of the bulk antiferromagnetic domain state and the interface magnetization coupled to it. The switchable exchange bias sets in exactly at the bulk Néel temperature. The control of magnetic properties by electric fields is key to realizing spintronics devices. The surface of the antiferromagnetic magnetoelectric Cr2O3 is now shown to exhibit room-temperature ferromagnetism, whose direction can be switched by an electric field. This magnetization switches the exchange-bias field with magnetic multilayers grown on Cr2O3, promising a new route towards room-temperature spintronics devices.},

We also report the discovery of magnetic anneal-ing effects in an antiferromagnet. In conjunction with other structure-sensitive phenomena which we found by means of magnetoelectric (ME) measurements , these magnetic annealing effects will be shown to provide the first strong evidence for the existence of antiferromagnetic "domains.

Our experimental results show that the temperature dependence of V~~ and V~ is essentially the same as that of the n ~~ and n& which we deduced from our (ME)@ effect' experiments and described satisfactorily in a recent theoretical' study. As shown in Fig. 1, the temperature dependence of I Vg I and 1 &8 aPP I [which were measured by means of the (ME)H and (ME)@ effects, respec-tively] are also in agreement. Since the values of antiferromagnetic permeabilities are close to unity, we find that ngaPP (the measured value of o. g) is given by the relation ng PP=[1-(Nsi/4m)]ng, where Nz& is the axial demagnetizing factor of an oblate spheroid having the same axial ratio as the disks used in the ME measurements. Furthermore , we observed that the signs of VI9 and 1 ng aPP reverse at the same temperature.

In our experiments on Cr203 the applied electric field was zero. Using x-ray-oriented single-crystal disks whose cylindrical axes z' were at an angle 8 (8 =0, 90', and 8~ =30') to the z axis, we switched on a magnetic field H along z' and measured the voltage V which was induced between the silvered plane surfaces of the disks. For fields up to the highest values used (H = 2500 oe), V was found to be proportional to H. Although V decays with a relaxation time 7 determined by the conductivity and dielectric constant of Cr~03, the value of v was found to be sufficiently large to permit us to measure V with a vacuum tube electrometer (Keithley Instruments, Inc. , Model 610R). In the vicinity of room temperature the low-voltage measurements could not be made because of drift in the apparatus. The actual voltage V may not be equal to the open-circuit voltage Vo (because the resistance of the disks may not be small in comparison to the input impedance of the electrom-eter), but it is clear the V must be proportional 50},

abstract = {Antiferromagnets have recently surged as the prominent material platform for the next generation spintronics devices. Despite the remarkable abundance of antiferromagnets and the variety of their spin textures in nature, they share a widely common, if not ubiquitous, feature. Magnetoelasticity, which is expressed as strictions of different origin, relativistic and/or exchange, significantly contributes to the magnetic anisotropy of antiferromagnets. Crucially, a general theoretical framework able to address the role of domain walls on the spin dynamics in antiferromagnets in the presence of magnetoelasticity is lacking. Here we tackle this problem developing a very general macroscopic phenomenological model. We demonstrate that the magnetoelasticity defines both the equilibrium and dynamical magnetic properties of easy-plane antiferromagnets in linear and nonlinear regimes. We employ our model to reproduce experimental results, showing that domain walls majorly affect the optically driven ultrafast nonlinear spin dynamics. Our model can be applied to a wide group of materials and, if properly extended, can be utilised to describe also other physical scenarios, key in the establishment of concepts for antiferromagnetic spintronics.},

abstract = {Antiferromagnetic materials could represent the future of spintronic applications thanks to the numerous interesting features they combine: they are robust against perturbation due to magnetic fields, produce no stray fields, display ultrafast dynamics and are capable of generating large magneto-transport effects. Intense research efforts over the past decade have been invested in unraveling spin transport properties in antiferromagnetic materials. Whether spin transport can be used to drive the antiferromagnetic order and how subsequent variations can be detected are some of the thrilling challenges currently being addressed. Antiferromagnetic spintronics started out with studies on spin transfer, and has undergone a definite revival in the last few years with the publication of pioneering articles on the use of spin-orbit interactions in antiferromagnets. This paradigm shift offers possibilities for radically new concepts for spin manipulation in electronics. Central to these endeavors are the need for predictive models, relevant disruptive materials and new experimental designs. This paper reviews the most prominent spintronic effects described based on theoretical and experimental analysis of antiferromagnetic materials. It also details some of the remaining bottlenecks and suggests possible avenues for future research.},

abstract = {Spintronics of antiferromagnets is a new and rapidly developing field of the physics of magnetism. Even without macroscopic magnetization, antiferromagnets, similar to ferromagnetic materials are affected by spin-polarized current, and as in ferromagnets this phenomenon is based on a spin-dependent interaction between localized and free electrons. However, due to the nature of antiferromagnetic materials (complex magnetic structure, essential role of exchange interactions, absence of macroscopic magnetization) the study of possible spintronic effects requires new theoretical and experimental approaches. The purpose of this review is to systemize and describe recent developments in this area. After presenting the main features of structure and behavior of antiferromagnets various microscopic and phenomenological models for description of the current-induced phenomena in heterostructures containing ferro- and antiferromagnetic layers are considered. The questions related to an effect of antiferromagnetic ordering on an electric current, as well as the questions of possible creation of fully antiferromagnetic spin valves are discussed. In addition, we briefly discuss available experimental results and try to interpret them. VC},

In the AC-demagnetized state, spatial distributions of the XMCD corresponding to the magnetic domains were clearly observed. In particular, ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic magnetic domains were separately observed by tuning the photon energy to either the ferromagnetic Co L3 edge or the antiferromagnetic Cr L3 edge. The ferromagnetic domain pattern is similar to the ones previously reported for Co/Pt multilayers, and the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic domains are spatially coupled. The magnetization curve measured after cooling the sample, while maintaining the demagnetized state, exhibited positive and negative exchange biases simultaneously, which suggests that the exchange bias is determined on a domain-by-domain basis.},

In particular, the longitudinal spin relaxation of the NV defect accelerates in the presence of magnetic noise with a spectral component at its electron spin resonance frequency. We look into this effect quantitatively by applying a calibrated and tunable magnetic noise on a single NV defect. We show that an increase of the longitudinal spin relaxation rate translates into a reduction of the photoluminescence (PL) signal emitted under continuous optical illumination, which can be explained using a simplified three-level model of the NV defect. This PL quenching mechanism offers a simple, all-optical method to detect magnetic noise sources at the nanoscale.},

abstract = {Antiferromagnetic materials promise improved performance for spintronic applications as they are robust against external magnetic field perturbations and allow for faster magnetization dynamics compared to ferromagnets. The direct observation of the antiferromagnetic state, however, is challenging due to the absence of a macroscopic magnetization. Here, we show that the spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) is a versatile tool to probe the antiferromagnetic spin structure via simple electrical transport experiments by investigating the easy-plane antiferromagnetic insulators $\alpha${\`{A}}Fe 2 O 3 (hematite) and NiO in bilayer heterostructures with a Pt heavy-metal top electrode. While rotating an external magnetic field in three orthogonal planes, we record the longitudinal and the transverse resistivities of Pt and observe characteristic resistivity modulations consistent with the SMR effect. We analyze both their amplitude and phase and compare the data to the results from a prototypical collinear ferrimagnetic Y 3 Fe 5 O 12 /Pt bilayer. The observed magnetic field dependence is explained in a comprehensive model, based on two magnetic sublattices and taking into account magnetic field-induced modifications of the domain structure. Our results show that the SMR allows us to understand the spin configuration and to investigate magnetoelastic effects in antiferromagnetic multi-domain materials. Furthermore, in $\alpha${\`{A}}Fe 2 O 3 /Pt bilayers, we find an unexpectedly large SMR amplitude of 2:5 {\^{A}} 10 {\`{A}}3 , twice as high as for prototype Y 3 Fe 5 O 12 /Pt bilayers, making the system particularly interesting for room-temperature anti-ferromagnetic spintronic applications.

Here, we determine the material parameters of the insulating iron oxide hematite, $\alpha$-Fe 2 O 3 , using the surface sensitive spin-Hall magnetoresistance (SMR). Combined with a simple analytical model, we extract the antiferromagnetic anisotropies and the bulk Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya field over a wide range of temperatures and magnetic fields. Across the Morin phase transition, we show that the electrical response is dominated by the antiferromagnetic N{\'{e}}el vector rather than by the emergent weak magnetic moment.

@article{Chiang2019,
abstract = {Much theoretical and experimental attention has been focused on the electrical switching of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) N{\'{e}}el vector via spin-orbit torque. Measurements employing multiterminal patterned structures of Pt=AFM show recurring signals of the supposedly planar Hall effect and magnetoresistance, implying AFM switching. We show in this Letter that similar signals have been observed in structures with and without the AFM layer, and of an even larger magnitude using different metals and substrates. These may not be the conclusive evidence of spin-orbit torque switching of AFM, but the thermal artifacts of patterned metal structure on substrate. Large current densities in the metallic devices, beyond the Ohmic regime, can generate unintended anisotropic thermal gradients and voltages. AFM switching requires unequivocal detection of the AFM N{\'{e}}el vector before and after SOT switching. Purely electrical control of magnetic devices is an ultimate goal in spintronics. Previously, spin transfer torque (STT) could provide electrical switching of ferromagnetic (FM) layers but required at least two FM entities, e.g., Co=Cu=Co, where the spin-polarized current from one FM switches the magnetization of the other FM [1]. The recent discovery of spin-orbit torque (SOT) accommodates electrical switching of a single FM layer adjacent to a heavy metal (HM), such as in HM/FM bilayers [2-4]. Spin-orbit torque (SOT) switching is based on the spin Hall effect, where a charge current through the HM (e.g., Pt) with a large spin Hall angle $\theta$ SH generates a pure spin current in the lateral direction with the spin index $\sigma$ in the third direction. Above a threshold current density, the SOT can electrically switch the adjacent FM with in-plane anisotropy as well as perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, but the latter requires an external field along the current direction, and is thus highly undesirable. Several schemes have been demonstrated to achieve field-free SOT switching of the FM layer with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy [5-12]. It has been well established in both STT and SOT that switching of the magnetization M of an FM layer occurs only when the current density j has exceeded the critical value j c [1-12]. There is no appreciable change of M at j < j c , regardless of the duration of the current or the number of such current pulses. Only until j ≥ j c , swift and irreversible changes in M occur. Switching (or lack thereof) can be readily revealed by the measurement of M using magnetometry, or more simply, by suitable Hall effect and magnetoresistance (MR). The evidence for switching is unequivocal and can be readily verified by rotating M of the FM via a small magnetic field to the specific directions. The recent proposal of electrical switching via SOT of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials, with the potential of ushering in AFM spintronics with terahertz frequencies, has attracted much attention [13-18]. However, unlike FMs, AFMs have no net magnetization (M ¼ 0). They are weakly responsive to magnetic field, but display a rich variety of AFM spin structures from uniaxial to kagome lattice. Most theoretical and experimental studies of AFM switching have focused on the simplest AFMs with two colinear sublattice magnetizations in opposite directions M 1 ¼ −M 2 defining a N{\'{e}}el vector n N{\'{e}}el¼ðM 1 −M 2 Þ=2M 0 , where M 0 is the magnitude of the sublattice magnetization. Theories suggest that the antidamping SOT, but not the fieldlike SOT, can switch the AFM N{\'{e}}el vector n N{\'{e}}el with M ¼ 0 [19]. However, ascertaining electrical switching of the AFM N{\'{e}}el vector remains a formidable challenge, compounded by the fact that most AFMs have no well-defined n N{\'{e}}el. Experimental exploration of AFM switching was first reported in epitaxial thin films of CuMnAs, an unusual metallic AFM with broken inversion symmetry [13]. As such, it is argued that CuMnAS (a similar situation also exists in Mn 2 Au) affords N{\'{e}}el SOT switching without the necessity of an adjacent HM layer [13-15]. Most AFM switching studies have used Pt=NiO, where the SOT from Pt may switch NiO [16-18], a well-known AFM insulator. It has been assumed in the AFM switching studies that the AFM thin films would acquire the same AFM spin structures as those in bulk crystals, a premise that has not been borne out in extensive studies of exchange bias, which also involves AFM thin films [20]. To detect AFM switching, most studies have employed multiterminal structures, such as the four-terminal or the eight-terminal patterned structure.

abstract = {A quantitative investigation of the current-induced torque in antiferromagnets represents a great challenge due to the lack of an independent method for controlling N{\'{e}}el vectors. By utilizing an antiferromagnetic insulator with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction $\alpha$-Fe 2 O 3 , we show that the N{\'{e}}el vector can be controlled with a moderate external field, which is further utilized to calibrate the current-induced magnetic dynamics. We find that the current-induced magnetoresistance change in antiferro-magnets can be complicated by resistive switching that does not have a magnetic origin. By excluding nonmagnetic switching and comparing the current-induced dynamics with the field-induced one, we determine the nature and magnitude of current-induced effects in Pt=$\alpha$-Fe 2 O 3 bilayer films. Electrical control and detection of magnetic ordering inside antiferromagnets has attracted considerable interest for potential advantages in operating speed and device densities. Current-induced magnetic switching has recently been reported in both metallic [1-7] and insulating [8-11] antiferromagnetic systems. In the former case, special crystal symmetries are utilized for realizing staggered spin-orbit torque, while in the latter one, the spin torque from an adjacent heavy metal layer is utilized for inducing magnetic dynamics. In these studies, anisotropic magneto-resistance, spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR), or the related planar Hall resistance is generally employed to characterize the electrically induced 90° N{\'{e}}el vector switching. However, unlike ferromagnetic systems, where the current-induced spin torque is calibrated by using an external magnetic field as a standard [12-14], a quantitative relationship between the change of resistance value and the magnitude of spin torque in antiferromagnets remains to be built. So far x-ray based imaging techniques, which require specialized facilities, have to be utilized to determine the ratio of switched magnetic domains [2,7,8,10]. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of an electrical measurement method that can be used to quantify the magnitude of current-induced effects in antiferromagnets. $\alpha$-Fe 2 O 3 is a well-studied antiferromagnetic insulator [15-17], with a high N{\'{e}}el temperature (955 K) and strong antiferromagnetic exchange interaction (effective exchange field 900-1000 T). As shown in Fig. 1(a), $\alpha$-Fe 2 O 3 has a trigonal crystal structure, and the two spin sublattices are stacked alternatively along the (0001) direction. It is well known [18] that, at room temperature, $\alpha$-Fe 2 O 3 exhibits an easy-plane anisotropy which has a very weak ferromagnet-ism (M s ∼ 2 emu=cm 3) due to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, which causes a <0.1° in-plane canting angle between magnetic moments of the two sublattices. Because of the very weak magnetic anisotropy within the basal plane [18], the spin-flop field for aligning the N{\'{e}}el vector perpendicular to the external field direction in $\alpha$-Fe 2 O 3 can be very low (<1 T), providing a convenient way for controlling the magnetic ordering orientation. In the meantime , the small net moment (M) is perpendicularly oriented with respect to the N{\'{e}}el vector (N) direction, allowing us to separate the different contributions from M and N to magnetic dynamics and transport effects such as SMR. Therefore, $\alpha$-Fe 2 O 3 represents a nice antiferromagnetic material platform, enabling us to characterize the electrically induced magnetic dynamics by comparing it to field-induced ones. We grew $\alpha$-Fe 2 O 3 films on $\alpha$-Al 2 O 3 (0001) substrates with magnetron sputtering and postdeposition annealing. As shown in Fig. 1(b), despite the lattice mismatch of ∼5.8%, epitaxial $\alpha$-Fe 2 O 3 (0001) films were obtained. The mag-netization hysteresis curves measured with a superconduct-ing quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer at 300 K are illustrated in Fig. 1(c), which show a small M s of around 1.5-2 emu=cm 3 and a coercive field of 500-1000 Oe within the entire thickness range of 10-120 nm, which is consistent with previously reported values [18,19]. In order to study current-induced switching and observe SMR, we sputter 5 nm Pt on $\alpha$-Fe 2 O 3 films and fabricate Hall bars of various widths [Fig. 1(d)], with the voltage and current channels aligned along the ½10 ¯ 10 and ½ ¯ 12 ¯ 10 directions [Fig. 3(a)]. Both longitudinal (R long) and transverse resistances (R H) were measured with a rotating external field in the film plane, which aligns N perpendicular to the field orientation [Figs. 1(e) and 1(f)].

abstract = {In the quest for post-CMOS technologies, ferromagnetic skyrmions and their anti-particles have shown great promise as topologically protected1–6 solitonic information carriers in memory-in-logic or neuromorphic devices1, 7–9. However, the presence of dipolar fields in ferromagnets, restricting the formation of ultra-small topological textures2–4, 6, 7, 10, and the deleterious skyrmion Hall effect when driven by spin torques7, 8, 10 have thus far inhibited their practical implementations. Antiferromagnetic analogues, which are predicted to demonstrate relativistic dynamics, fast deflection-free motion and size scaling have recently come into intense focus7, 11–17, but their experimental realizations in natural antiferromagnetic systems are yet to emerge. Here, we demonstrate a family of topological antiferromagnetic spin-textures in $\alpha$Fe2O3 – an earth-abundant oxide insulator – capped with a Pt over-layer. By exploiting a first-order analogue of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism18, 19, we stabilize exotic merons-antimerons (half-skyrmions6), and bimerons14, 20, which can be erased by magnetic fields and re-generated by temperature cycling. These structures have characteristic sizes in the range ∼100 nm that can be chemically controlled via precise tuning of the exchange and anisotropy, with pathway to further scaling. Driven by current-based spin torques from the heavy-metal over-layer, some of these AFM textures could emerge as prime candidates for low-energy antiferromagnetic spintronics at room temperature1, 7–9, 21.},

abstract = {Vortices, occurring whenever a flow field 'whirls' around a one-dimensional core, are among the simplest topological structures, ubiquitous to many branches of physics. In the crystalline state, vortex formation is rare, since it is generally hampered by long-range interactions: in ferroic materials (ferromagnetic and ferroelectric), vortices are observed only when the effects of the dipole-dipole interaction are modified by confinement at the nanoscale 1-3 , or when the parameter associated with the vorticity does not couple directly with strain 4. Here, we observe an unprecedented form of vortices in antiferromagnetic haematite ($\alpha$-Fe 2 O 3) epitaxial films, in which the primary whirling parameter is the staggered mag-netization. Remarkably, ferromagnetic topological objects with the same vorticity and winding number as the $\alpha$-Fe 2 O 3 vortices are imprinted onto an ultra-thin Co ferromagnetic over-layer by interfacial exchange. Our data suggest that the ferromagnetic vortices may be merons (half-skyrmions, carrying an out-of plane core magnetization), and indicate that the vortex/meron pairs can be manipulated by the application of an in-plane magnetic field, giving rise to large-scale vortex-antivortex annihilation. $\alpha$-Fe 2 O 3 is a 'classic' room-temperature antiferromagnet, with a N{\'{e}}el temperature of 948 K and the trigonal corundum crystal structure (space group R 3c). The Fe moments lie in the basal ab plane and are antiferromagnetically ordered along c (Fig. 1c). We grew 10-nm-thick $\alpha$-Fe 2 O 3 epitaxial films with a Co(1 nm)/Al(1 nm) over-layer on a (0001)-Al 2 O 3 substrate by magnetron sputtering (see Methods). The Co layer was confirmed to be ferromagneti-cally ordered, with easy-plane anisotropy, by magneto-optical Kerr effect magnetometry (MOKE, see Methods) and its coercive field was found to be $\sim$8 mT. Vector-mapped X-ray magnetic linear (for $\alpha$-Fe 2 O 3) and circular (for Co) dichroism photoemission electron microscopy (XMLD-PEEM and XMCD-PEEM) images were collected at room temperature and zero applied magnetic field at the Fe-L 3 and Co-L 3 edges, respectively, using the I06 beamline at the Diamond Light Source, Didcot, UK. Exploiting the anisotropy of the XMLD/XMCD signal, data collected at different sample rotations were combined, to determine absolutely the direction paral-lel/anti-parallel to the antiferromagnetic (AFM) spins and the Co spin direction at the same positions on the surface of the sample (Fig.},

abstract = {Antiferromagnetic materials are promising platforms for next-generation spintronics owing to their fast dynamics and high robustness against parasitic magnetic fields. However, nanoscale imaging of the magnetic order in such materials with zero net magnetization remains a major experimental challenge. Here we show that non-collinear antiferromagnetic spin textures can be imaged by probing the magnetic noise they locally produce via thermal populations of magnons. To this end, we perform nanoscale, all-optical relaxometry with a scanning quantum sensor based on a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defect in diamond. Magnetic noise is detected through an increase of the spin relaxation rate of the NV defect, which results in an overall reduction of its photoluminescence signal under continuous laser illumination. As a proof-of-concept, the efficiency of the method is demonstrated by imaging various spin textures in synthetic antiferromagnets, including domain walls, spin spirals and antiferromagnetic skyrmions. This imaging procedure could be extended to a large class of intrinsic antiferromagnets and opens up new opportunities for studying the physics of localized spin wave modes for magnonics.},

Whereas nanoscale thin-film materials are key to the development of future antiferromagnetic spintronic technologies, existing experimental tools tend to suffer from low resolution or expensive and complex equipment requirements. We offer a simple, high-resolution alternative by addressing the ubiquitous surface magnetization of magnetoelectric antiferromagnets in a granular thin-film sample on the nanoscale using single-spin magnetometry in combination with spin-sensitive transport experiments. Specifically, we quantitatively image the evolution of individual nanoscale antiferromagnetic domains in 200 nm thin films of Cr 2 O 3 in real space and across the paramagnet-to-antiferromagnet phase transition, finding an average domain size of 230 nm, several times larger than the average grain size in the film. These experiments allow us to discern key properties of the Cr 2 O 3 thin film, including the boundary magnetic moment density, the variation of critical temperature throughout the film, the mechanism of domain formation, and the strength of exchange coupling between individual grains comprising the film. Our work offers novel insights into the magnetic ordering mechanism of Cr 2 O 3 and firmly establishes single-spin magnetometry as a versatile and widely applicable tool for addressing antiferromagnetic thin films on the nanoscale.},

abstract = {Understanding the behaviour of spins and charges in materials is at the heart of condensed matter physics. In the past few decades, a wide range of new materials displaying exciting physical phenomena has been discovered and explored. Examples include van der Waals materials 1 , topological insulators 2,3 and complex oxide interfaces 4. There is intense ongoing activity focused on developing and understanding these materials and on creating new ones. The success of these efforts relies on advances in theory and materials synthesis and on the development of sensitive measurement techniques. Because spins and moving charges generate stray magnetic fields, a local and non-perturbative magnetic field sensor that can operate over a broad temperature range could be used to characterize the growing number of correlated and topological electron systems. The spin of an elementary particle such as an electron or a nucleus can be used as an atomic-scale magnetic field sensor. Thus, spin-based magnetometry techniques, such as muon spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and neutron scattering 5-7 , give access to the magnetic structure of a material on the atomic scale. However, these techniques do not provide real-space imaging or sensitivity to samples with nanoscale volumes. By contrast, techniques such as magnetic force microscopy, magnetic resonance force microscopy and scanning superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) 8-12 allow real-space imaging of the magnetic fields emanating from nanoscale devices, but they have a finite size and act as perturbative probes and/or over a narrow temperature range. Magnetometry based on the electron spin associated with the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defect in diamond (FIG. 1a) combines powerful aspects of both worlds. The NV spin is an atomic-sized sensor that benefits from a large toolbox of spin manipulation techniques and can be controllably positioned within a few nanometres of the system under study. In the decade since it was first proposed 13,14 and implemented 15,16 , NV magnetometry has demonstrated a combination of capabilities that sets it apart from any other magnetic-sensing technique: room-temperature single-electron 17 and nuclear 18 spin sensitivity; spatial resolution on the nanometre scale 19 ; operation under a broad range of temperatures (from $\sim$1 K to above room temperature 20,21) and magnetic fields (from zero to a few Tesla 22,23); and non-perturbative operation. However, only in the past few years has NV magnetometry begun to be used to explore condensed matter systems. In this Review, we describe the application of NV magnetometry to the exploration of magnetic and Abstract | The magnetic fields generated by spins and currents provide a unique window into the physics of correlated-electron materials and devices. First proposed only a decade ago, magnetometry based on the electron spin of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defects in diamond is emerging as a platform that is excellently suited for probing condensed matter systems; it can be operated from cryogenic temperatures to above room temperature, has a dynamic range spanning from direct current to gigahertz and allows sensor-sample distances as small as a few nanometres. As such, NV magnetometry provides access to static and dynamic magnetic and electronic phenomena with nanoscale spatial resolution. Pioneering work has focused on proof-of-principle demonstrations of its nanoscale imaging resolution and magnetic field sensitivity. Now, experiments are starting to probe the correlated-electron physics of magnets and superconductors and to explore the current distributions in low-dimensional materials. In this Review, we discuss the application of NV magnetometry to the exploration of condensed matter physics, focusing on its use to study static and dynamic magnetic textures and static and dynamic current distributions.

A particularly intriguing question is whether lattice vibrations can also be used to control or even switch domains in collinear antiferromagnets, where all other mechanisms fail. To answer this question, here we study the magnetic effects induced by tunable and narrow-band infrared optical pulses in single crystals of antiferromagnetic nickel oxide. Our measurements reveal that a resonant excitation in the vicinity of the frequency of longitudinal optical phonons leads to the displacement of antiferromagnetic domains in NiO, potentially revealing a promising method to manipulate antiferromagnetic order.},

abstract = {What we believe to be the first experimental results have been obtained on strong magnetic x-ray dichroism in the M4, 5 absorption spectra of magnetically ordered rare-earth materials, in accordance with recent predictions. The feasibility of using x-rays to determine the magnetic structure of magnetically ordered materials by magnetic dichroism has recently been predicted theoretically. ' Strong magnetic x-ray dichroism (MXD) is expected in the Mq, q absorption edge structure of rare-earth-metal compounds. Polarized synchrotron radiation can therefore be used to reveal information on the local rare-earth-metal magnetic moments in solids, thin films, and surfaces. In this Brief Report we will give what we believe is the first experimental proof of this effect. The M4, q absorption in rare-earth-metal compounds shows good agreement with the atomic Hartree-Fock calculations for the transitions from the 4f"(J) Hund's rule ground state to the manifold of 3d 4f"+'(J') final states. Although in x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) hundreds of excited levels may be involved, one can distinguish between three different types of excitations, namely for J'-J-1, 0, and 1. In the presence of a magnetic field the 2J+1 degenerate ground state 4f"(J) splits into sublevels MJ-J,. .. , +J. The relative population of these sublevels depends on the temperature. That the polarization vector of the x rays has a drastic effect on the spectrum can be seen from the simple case where only M-J is populated (T 0 K). With the polarization direction parallel to the magnetization only the hM 0 transitions are allowed. The transitions J'-J-1 will then vanish, because the M'-Jsublevel is not present in the J' J-l state. Here, we will illustrate in more detail the use of MXD on terbium iron garnet (TbIG), which has a rather complicated magnetic structure. The rhombohedral (or trigonal distorted cubic) cell of ferrimagnetic rare-earth-metal iron garnets (R3Fe50t2) contains eight formula units. 5 The Fe + ions occupy the 24 d (tetrahedron) and the 16 a (oc-tahedron) positions. The larger R + ions occupy the 6 c (dodecahedral) positions. Below the Weel temperature the spins of the 24 d and 16 a irons are ordered antiparallel along the [111]axis. The rare-earth-metal moments couple antiferromagnetically to the net iron moment. By symmetry the 6 c sites can be divided into c$\sim$, c2, c3 and cI c2 c3 where C2 (c2) and C3 (c3) are obtained from the c$\sim$ (ct) by rotation around the trigonal [111]axis. From neutron diffraction at 4.2 K the Tb moments in TbIG are known to form a double umbrella structure. 7s The magnetic moments on c$\sim$ and cI are both in the (011) plane, having angles P 30. 79' and P'-28. 07' with the trigo-nal axis, and absolute values m 8.18ptt and m' 8.90ptt, respectively. Above 4.2 K the values of P, P', m and rn' are expected to decrease. In our experiment, a single crystal of TbIG was mounted on a rotatable helium-flow cryostat in an ultrahigh vacuum of-10 ' Torr. The temperature at the surface of the sample was 55+'5 K. A CosSm permanent magnet provided a field of-2 kG parallel to the [111] surface normal, which is the easy direction of magnetization. Synchrotron radiation from the 540-MeV storage ring ACO (Anneau de Collision d'Orsay) at the Laboratoire pour 1'Utilisation du Rayonnement Electromagnetique was monochromatized with a constant-deviation double-crystal monochromator. Using beryl (1010) crystals (morganite) the energy resolution at the Tb M5 edge is 0.9 eV full width at half maximum. In the spectral region of interest the x-ray flux is invariant with photon energy. The emitted radiation in the equatorial plane of the storage ring is linearly polarized. In the actual setup it is s polarized with respect to the beryl crystals and p polarized with respect to the sample. XAS spectra were measured using the electron yield},

abstract = {A theory is presented which predicts an anomalously large magnetic dichroism in the M4 q x-ray absorption-edge structure of rare earths in magnetically ordered materials. Polarized synchrotron radiation can therefore be used to determine accurately the magnitude, the orientation, and the temperature and magnetic field dependence of the local rare-earth magnetic moment in a large variety of magnetically ordered materials and thin films. PACS numbers: 78.20.Ls, 78.70.Dm Improved resolution, synchrotron sources, and advanced theory have strongly revived interest in the edge structures of x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The multiple-component edge structure of highly correlated narrow-band systems such as transition-metal compounds' and rare-earth metals and their compounds is now well understood in terms of atomic multiplet theory and the configuration interaction involving the highly localized 3d or 4f electrons and the delocalized valence-and conduction-band states. These highly correlated systems are of special interest because of their diversity of magnetic properties. It is well known from atomic theory that the optical dipole selection rules, as in XAS, cause the observed fine structure to depend on the detailed nature of the ground state. 2 This has also been demonstrated for strongly correlated atoms in solids. In this paper we predict that the polarization dependence of the 3d 4f XAS (M4 &) spectra of rare earths is expected to be very sensitive to the magnetic structure of the ground state and to unequal population of the MJ sublevels as found in magnetic systems. This implies that XAS can be used to determine the local magnetic moment of a rare-earth atom in a magnetically ordered material, the orientation of the local moment relative to the total magnetization direction, as well as the temperature and field dependence thereof. We derive simple equations relating these properties to the experimental temperature-and orientation-dependent spectra. The 3d 4f XAS spectra of rare-earth metals3 and compounds have recently been shown to agree extremely well with atomic calculations of the optical transitions from a 4f"(J) ground state as determined by Hund's rule to the many possible 3d94f"+'(J') final states. Optical selection rules dictate that J'-J =0, +1 in intermediate coupling. In the 3d94f"+' final configuration there are many states (hundreds) satisfying these selection rules. Upon application of a magnetic field the (2J+1)-fold degenerate (with of small crystal-field effects) ground state splits up into its M sublevels with energy-gp, BHM of which only the level M=-J is populated at T=0 K. The Boltzmann factor of the sublevels is given by exp(g p, aHM/kT) = exp(-M/8) which defines a reduced temperature 0 = kT/g i p, a iH. Assuming that the energy spacing between the lowest J levels in the initial state is large compared to kT, we can neglect the van Vleck term, 9 which is only important for 4f and 4f 6 ions.

The surface sensitive images with a lateral resolution of better than 50 nm reveal surface line defects that exhibit antiferromagnetic order with a reduced N{\'{e}}el temperature (455 K) relative to the rest of the film surface and the bulk (523 K).

@article{Xu2020,
abstract = {The spin-orbit torque induced by a topological insulator (TI) is theoretically examined for spin wave generation in a neighboring antiferromagnetic thin film. The investigation is based on the micromagnetic simulation of N{\'{e}}el vector dynamics and the analysis of transport properties in the TI. The results clearly illustrate that propagating spin waves can be achieved in the antiferromagnetic thin-film strip through localized excitation, traveling over a long distance. The oscillation amplitude gradually decays due to the non-zero damping as the N{\'{e}}el vector precesses around the magnetic easy axis with a fixed frequency. The frequency is also found to be tunable via the strength of the driving electrical current density. While both the bulk and the surface states of the TI contribute to induce the effective torque, the calculation indicates that the surface current plays a dominant role over the bulk counterpart except in the heavily degenerate cases. Compared to the more commonly applied heavy metals, the use of a TI can substantially reduce the threshold current density to overcome the magnetic anisotropy, making it an efficient choice for spin wave generation. The N{\'{e}}el vector dynamics in the nano-oscillator geometry are examined as well.},

In the current era, the commercial transition of nanotechnology from research level to industrial level is stimulating the world's total economic growth. However, commercialization of nanoparticles might offer possible risks once they are liberated in the environment. In recent years, the use of zebrafish (Danio rerio) as an established animal model system for nanoparticle toxicity assay is growing exponentially. In the current in-depth review, we discuss the recent research approaches employing adult zebrafish and their embryos for nanoparticle toxicity assessment. Different types of parameters are being discussed here which are used to evaluate nanoparticle toxicity such as hatching achievement rate, developmental malformation of organs, damage in gill and skin, abnormal behavior (movement impairment), immunotoxicity, genotoxicity or gene expression, neurotoxicity, endocrine system disruption, reproduction toxicity and finally mortality. Furthermore, we have also highlighted the toxic effect of different nanoparticles such as silver nanoparticle, gold nanoparticle, and metal oxide nanoparticles (TiO2, Al2O3, CuO, NiO and ZnO). At the end, future directions of zebrafish model and relevant assays to study nanoparticle toxicity have also been argued.},

The finite size effect of ordering temperature for ultrathin single crystal CoO film is revealed by the thickness and temperature dependent measurement of birefringence contrast. The magneto-optical birefringence effect is found to strongly depend on the photon energy of incident light, and a surprising large polarization rotation angle up to 168.5 mdeg is obtained from a 4.6 nm CoO film with a blue light source, making it possible to further investigate the evolution of AFM domains in AFM ultrathin film under external field.},

The symmetries and the electronic configurations of the cobalt ions in the oxides are determined.

The calculated Kerr rotation angles are large, being comparable to that of transition-metal magnets such as bcc Fe. The large Kerr rotation angles and ellipticities are found to originate from the lifting of band double degeneracy due to the absence of spatial symmetry in the Mn3X noncollinear antiferromagnets which together with the time-reversal symmetry would preserve the Kramers theorem. Our results indicate that Mn3X would provide a rare material platform for exploration of subtle magneto-optical phenomena in noncollinear magnetic materials without net magnetization.},

The maximum optical transmittance of 95{\%} was observed for the film deposited at 100 W. The slight shift in transmission threshold towards higher wavelength region with increasing rf power revealed the systematic reduction in optical energy band gap (3.93 to 3.12 eV) of the films. The dispersion curve of the refractive index shows an anomalous dispersion in the absorption region and a normal dispersion in the transparent region. It was observed that the dispersion data obeyed the single oscillator of the Wemple-Didomenico model, from which the dispersion parameters, dielectric constants, relaxation time, and optical non-linear susceptibility were evaluated.

abstract = {We investigate the current-induced switching of the N{\'{e}}el order in NiO(001)/Pt heterostructures, which is manifested electrically via the spin Hall magnetoresistance. Significant reversible changes in the longitudinal and transverse resistances are found at room temperature for a current threshold lying in the range of 107 A/cm2. The order-parameter switching is ascribed to the antiferromagnetic dynamics triggered by the (current-induced) antidamping torque, which orients the N{\'{e}}el order towards the direction of the writing current. This is in stark contrast to the case of antiferromagnets such as Mn2Au and CuMnAs, where fieldlike torques induced by the Edelstein effect drive the N{\'{e}}el switching, therefore resulting in an orthogonal alignment between the N{\'{e}}el order and the writing current. Our findings can be readily generalized to other biaxial antiferromagnets, providing broad opportunities for all-electrical writing and readout in antiferromagnetic spintronics.},

abstract = {The most popular theory concerning the electrical resistivity of metal foils is that given by Fuchs, despite the presence of a physically more realistic theory developed by Soffer. It is shown that as a result of using Fuchs' theory experimentalists have been led to erroneous conclusions regarding both the surface-induced deviations from Mathiessen's rule (DMR) and the temperature dependence of the product of the bulk resistivity and the bulk electron mean free path rho infinity lambda infinity. It is shown that Soffer's theory may be well fitted to the available data on aluminium foils using a temperature-independent rho infinity lambda infinity whilst also satisfactorily explaining surface-produced DMR. Consequently surface scattering is shown to be better characterised by Scoffer's model, which involves an angle-dependent scattering parameter, than by Fuchs' model which assumes that surface scattering is independent of angle of incidence. The two theories are shown to be equivalent only when the sample thickness is greater than the bulk electron mean free path.},

abstract = {Motivated by the presence of an unquenched orbital angular momentum in CoO, a team at Chalk River, including a recently hired research officer Roger Cowley, performed the first inelastic neutron scattering experiments on the classic Mott insulator [Sakurai {\$}\backslashtextit{\{}et al.{\}}{\$} 1968 Phys. Rev. {\$}\backslashmathbf{\{}167{\}}{\$} 510]. Despite identifying magnon modes at the zone boundary, the team was unable to parameterise the low energy magnetic excitation spectrum below {\$}T\backslashrm{\{}{\_}{\{}N{\}}{\}}{\$} using conventional pseudo-bosonic approaches. It would not be for another 40 years that Roger, now at Oxford and motivated by the discovery of the high-{\$}T{\_}{\{}c{\}}{\$} cuprate superconductors [Bednorz {\&} Muller 1986 Z. Phys. B {\$}\backslashmathbf{\{}64{\}}{\$} 189], would make another attempt at the parameterisation of the magnetic excitation spectrum that had previously alluded him. Upon his return to CoO, Roger found a system embroiled in controversy, with some of its most fundamental parameters still remaining undetermined. Faced with such a formidable task, Roger performed a series of inelastic neutron scattering experiments in the early 2010's on both CoO and a magnetically dilute structural analogue MgO. These experiments would prove instrumental in the determination of both single-ion [Cowley {\$}\backslashtextit{\{}et al.{\}}{\$} 2013 Phys. Rev.

Both these sets of parameters would eventually be used in a spin-orbit exciton model [Sarte {\$}\backslashtextit{\{}et al.{\}}{\$} 2019 Phys. Rev. B {\$}\backslashmathbf{\{}100{\}}{\$} 075143], developed by his longtime friend and collaborator Bill Buyers, to successfully parameterise the complex spectrum that both measured at Chalk River almost 50 years prior. The story of CoO is of one that has come full circle, one filled with both spectacular failures and intermittent, yet profound, little victories.},

Based on a new technique for evaluating the CF temperature during operation, we perform a statistical characterization of the critical filament temperature for the reset operation, i.e., the transition to the high-resistance state by the thermal dissolution of the CF. The thermal resistance of the CF and the activation energy for the dissolution mechanism are then evaluated, allowing for a physics-based numerical modeling of the reset operation based on CF thermal breakup. {\textcopyright} 2009 IEEE.},

The structural, optical and electrical properties of NiO films were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), visible spectrum and Hall effect measurements. The dependences of film properties on substrate temperature, crystalline structure and natural aging effect were studied. The results show that the resistivity increases as sputtering power increases from 100 to 200 W at constant temperature. The lowest resistivity and Hall coefficient obtained are 16.7 $\Omega$ cm and 1.99 cm3/C, respectively, as the sputtering power is 100 W and substrate temperature is 350°. The highest carrier concentration obtained is 3.13 × 1018 cm-3 as the sputtering power is 100 W and substrate temperature is 350°. The crystal structure was analyzed by X-ray diffraction method. The preferred orientation of NiO film changes from (111) to (200) when the substrate temperature varies from unheated condition to 350°. Electrical properties of NiO films were unstable and show a natural aging effect. Resistivity of NiO films increases as the time of natural aging increases. Under the substrate-unheated condition, the transmittance of as-deposited samples is lower compared to the film prepared at substrate temperature of 350 °C. The change in transmittance may be due to the microstructural change in the material. It is suggested that the sputtering power affects the preferred orientation of NiO film. Higher substrate temperature induces larger grain size and more perfect crystalline structure, which lead to low resistivity of NiO film. {\textcopyright} 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

When applied to antiferromagnetic transition-metal oxides (NiO, MnO, FeO, CoO), it solved the long-standing problem of reproducing the experimental values of the band gaps, which are underestimated in normal LSDF calculations. FeO and CoO become insulators, in contrast to the metallic ground state obtained in the usual LSDF calculations. Moreover, the calculated magnetic properties improved considerably due to the introduction of the USPC.

abstract = {This paper describes a two-terminal solid-state switch made from a thin film of nickel oxide. The switch has a typical OFF resistance of 10-20 M$\Omega$ and a typical ON resistance of 100-200 $\Omega$. Switching times are in the 0{\textperiodcentered}1-10 $\mu$sec range. The switching action is thought to be due to the formation and rupture of a nickel filament in the NiO matrix. The formation process is such that after about 100-1000 switching cycles, the devices to be described fail 'short'; i.e. they cannot be switched out of the ON condition with normal switching signal amplitudes. Several experiments which elucidate the switching mechanism and the terminal properties of the device are described. {\textcopyright} 1964.},

@article{Ferre1984,
abstract = {The study of changes in the refractive indices (with consequent changes of birefringence) of a transparent magnetic crystal which accompany changes in the magnetic order is becoming more popular. The authors review why this is. The first reason is that birefringence can be measured very accurately: the different experimental arrangements are reviewed. The second reason is because a birefringence measurement is an integrational spectroscopic technique and therefore it is studied both experimentally and theoretically as a branch of magneto-optics and hence gives information on the detailed energy level structure of the solid. The third reason is that in a number of interesting systems the birefringence is proportional to the magnetic energy over a wide temperature range and it is often a more convenient method of obtaining the magnetic specific heat than direct specific heat measurements; this is particularly true in magnetic crystals which show low dimensional ordering. The last reason is that in all magnetic crystals the birefringence change should vary like one of the thermodynamic critical exponents near to the phase transition. They review in detail the reasons why birefringence studies have become so successful for measuring critical exponents in pure and particularly mixed crystals.},

abstract = {The structures, relative stabilities, and multiplicities of the cationic, late-transition-metal oxides FeO+, CoO+, NiO+, and CuO+ are rationalized on the basis of ab initio computations. The bonding situation in these cations is analogous to that in the dioxygen molecule with a biradicaloid $\pi$-bonding, and hence the electronic ground states of these metal oxide cations correspond to their high-spin variants, FeO+ (6$\Sigma$+), CoO+ (5$\Delta$), NiO+ (4$\Sigma$-), CuO+ (3$\Sigma$-). Density functional theory augmented with CASPT2D computations is used to explore the reaction surface of FeO+ + H2 and to unravel the roots of the extremely low reactivity observed for this system. According to these calculations, the reaction violates spin-conservation rules and involves a curve crossing from the sextet ground state to the excited quartet surface, giving rise to a multicentered, energetically low-lying transition structure, from which the hydrido iron hydroxide cation H—Fe—OH+ is formed as the initial oxidation product. The implications of these results with respect to other ion/molecule processes of metal oxide cations with oxidizable organic substrates are discussed. {\textcopyright} 1994, American Chemical Society.

We find a highly localized and asymmetric magnetic sensitivity in the eight-terminal geometries that are frequently used in current-induced switching experiments, for instance, to probe antiferromagnetic materials. Using current-induced switching of antiferromagnetic NiO/Pt as an example, we estimate the change in the spin Hall magnetoresistance signal associated with switching events based on the domain-switching patterns observed via direct imaging. This estimate correlates with the actual electrical data after subtraction of a nonmagnetic contribution. Here, the consistency of the correlation across three measurement geometries with fundamentally different switching patterns strongly indicates a magnetic origin of the measured and analyzed electrical signals.},

Electrochromic films are therefore being developed for application in dynamic or "smart" windows that are at the forefront of emerging energy-saving advances in building technologies. Here we will describe the state-of-the-art technology that is being implemented in commercial applications. It predominantly relies on the use of tungsten oxide-based films (coloring with ion insertion) and nickel oxide-based films (coloring with ion extraction). We also suggest future research directions that are motivated by the need to reduce the production costs of large-area EC windows. Specifically, we describe the possibility of alternative less expensive manufacturing processes, as well as the development of flexible EC devices that allow for an inexpensive "retrofit" installation to existing structures. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

@article{Kaiser2007,
abstract = {The ordering of neighbouring atomic magnetic moments (spins) leads to important collective phenomena such as ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. A full understanding of magnetism on the nanometre scale therefore calls for information on the arrangement of spins in real space and with atomic resolution. Spin-polarized scanning tunnelling microscopy accomplishes this but can probe only conducting materials. Force microscopy can be used on any sample independent of its conductivity. In particular, magnetic force microscopy is well suited to exploring ferromagnetic domain structures. However, atomic resolution cannot be achieved because data acquisition involves the sensing of long-range magnetostatic forces between tip and sample. Magnetic exchange force microscopy has been proposed for overcoming this limitation: by using an atomic force microscope with a magnetic tip, it should be possible to detect the short-range magnetic exchange force between tip and sample spins. Here we show for a prototypical antiferromagnetic insulator, the (001) surface of nickel oxide, that magnetic exchange force microscopy can indeed reveal the arrangement of both surface atoms and their spins simultaneously. In contrast with previous attempts to implement this method, we use an external magnetic field to align the magnetic polarization at the tip apex so as to optimize the interaction between tip and sample spins. This allows us to observe the direct magnetic exchange coupling between the spins of the tip atom and sample atom that are closest to each other, and thereby demonstrate the potential of magnetic exchange force microscopy for investigations of inter-spin interactions at the atomic level. {\textcopyright}2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

The linear magnetic birefringence (LMB) and the dichroism (LMD) show pronounced structures between 13000 and 22000 cm+1 which decrease with increasing temperature and vanish above TN. They are connected with the 4T1g‐ and 4T2g‐absorption bands of the Mn2+ ions. In the LMB spectra a temperature‐dependent background is associated with the band gap absorption. Magnetic fields up to 7.5 T have no effect on the LMB and LMD. The temperature dependence of the optical anisotropy shows the behaviour of the long‐range order parameter of the phase transition which is discontinuous at TN. An exchange striction model which includes uniaxial stress and magnetic fields is discussed in the mean field approximation; the results are in quantitative agreement with the experimental data.

Here, we demonstrate the combined generation of broadband THz (incoherent) magnons and narrowband (coherent) magnons at 1 THz in low damping thin films of NiO/Pt. We evidence, experimentally and through modelling, two excitation processes of magnetization dynamics in NiO, an off-resonant instantaneous optical spin torque and a strain-wave-induced THz torque induced by ultrafast Pt excitation. Both phenomena lead to the emission of a THz signal through the inverse spin Hall effect in the adjacent heavy metal layer. We unravel the characteristic timescales of the two excitation processes found to be {\textless} 50 fs and {\textgreater} 300 fs, respectively, and thus open new routes towards the development of fast opto-spintronic devices based on antiferromagnetic materials.},

Comparison of the dynamical properties of the model antiferromagnet Cr(2)O(3) with model ferro- and ferrimagnets reveals that spin-lattice relaxation as the temporally limiting thermalization process of the magnetic subsystem is more complex and inherently faster than in compounds displaying a spontaneous magnetization. The exchange-bias compound NiO exhibits an ultrafast photoinduced AFM phase transition in the course of which the AFM order parameter is switched by 90 degrees. Properly timed sequences of pump pulses can repeatedly reorient the AFM order parameter within 10 ps, thus demonstrating ultrafast AFM switching.

The specific degrees of optical experiments - Including spectral, spatial, and temporal resolution - Lead to the observation of novel physical effects that cannot be revealed by other techniques of probing magnetism. These include local or hidden phase transitions, interacting magnetized and polarized sublattices and domain walls, and magnetic interfaces. SHG in various centrosymmetric and noncentrosymmetric crystal classes of antiferromagnetic oxides such as Cr 2 O 3 , hexagonal RMnO 3  (R = Sc, Y, In, Ho-Lu), magnetic garnet films, CuB  2 O 4 , CoO, and NiO, is discussed. {\textcopyright} 2005 Optical Society of America.},

The thinness of these oxide samples facilitates investigation by an array of surface techniques, many of which are precluded when applied to the corresponding bulk oxide. Layered and mixed binary oxides have been prepared by sequential synthesis of dissimilar oxide layers or co-deposition of two different oxides. Recent work has shown that the underlying oxide substrate can markedly influence the electronic and chemical properties of the overlayer oxide. The structural, electronic, and chemical properties of these ultrathin oxide films have been probed using Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electron energy loss spectroscopy (ELS), ion-scattering spectroscopy (ISS), high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), infrared reflectance absorption spectroscopy (IRAS), temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS).},

abstract = {Ultrafast control of magnets using femtosecond light pulses attracts interest regarding applications and fundamental physics of magnetism. Antiferromagnets are promising materials with magnon frequencies extending into the terahertz range. Visible or near-infrared light interacts mainly with the electronic orbital angular momentum. In many magnets, however, in particular with iron-group ions, the orbital momentum is almost quenched by the crystal field. Thus, the interaction of magnons with light is hampered, because it is only mediated by weak unquenching of the orbital momentum by spin-orbit interactions. Here we report all-optical excitation of magnons with frequencies up to 9 THz in antiferromagnetic CoO with an unquenched orbital momentum. In CoO, magnon modes are coupled oscillations of spin and orbital momenta with comparable amplitudes. We demonstrate excitations of magnon modes by directly coupling light with electronic orbital angular momentum, providing possibilities to develop magneto-optical devices operating at several terahertz with high output-to-input ratio.},

abstract = {The absence of net magnetization inside antiferromagnetic domains has made the control of their spatial distribution quite challenging. Here we experimentally demonstrate an optical method for controlling antiferromagnetic domain distributions in MnF2. Reduced crystalline symmetry can couple an order parameter with non-conjugate external stimuli. In the case of MnF2, time-reversal symmetry is macroscopically broken reflecting the different orientations of the two magnetic sublattices. Thus, it exhibits different absorption coefficients between two orthogonal linear polarizations below its antiferromagnetic transition temperature under an external magnetic field. Illumination with linearly polarized laser light under this condition selectively destructs the formation of a particular antiferromagnetic order via heating. As a result, the other antiferromagnetic order is favoured inside the laser spot, achieving spatially localized selection of an antiferromagnetic order. Applications to control of interface states at antiferromagnetic domain boundaries, exchange bias and control of spin currents are expected.},

The paramagnetic diffuse scattering predicted by Halpern and Johnson has been studied, resulting in the determination of the magnetic form factor for Mn++ ions. From the form factor, the radial distribution of the electrons in the 3d-shell of Mn++ has been determined, and this is compared with a theoretical distribution of Dancoff. Antiferromagnetic substances are shown to produce strong, coherent scattering effects in the diffraction pattern. The antiferromagnetic reflections have been used to determine the magnetic structure of the material below the antiferromagnetic Curie temperature. For some substances the magnetic unit cell is found to be larger than the chemical unit cell. The temperature dependence of the antiferromagnetic intensities has been studied, and the directional effects which characterize neutron scattering by aligned atomic moments have been used to determine the moment alignment with respect to crystallographic axes. From studies with magnetic ions possessing both orbital and spin moments, it is found that the antiferromagnetic intensities contain partial orbital moment components along with the spin moment component. The degree of orbital moment contribution agrees satisfactorily with that predicted by models of lattice quenching. {\textcopyright} 1951 The American Physical Society.},

A., Feb. 13, 1979) Based on accurate X-ray diffraction intensity data collected from spherically shaped single crystals, detailed electron-density distribu-tions have been studied for synthetic mono-oxides, Mg0 (periclase), Mn0 (manganosite) , CoO, and Ni0 (bunsenite) . Mg0 (Sanger, 1969; Vidal-Valat and Vidal,1978) , MnO, and Coo have the NaCI type struc-ture at room temperature. Although Ni0 is rhombohedral below a Neel temperature 523°K (Rooksky, 1948; Vernon, 1970) due to anti-ferromagnetic distortion from a NaCI type structure, the distortion is negligible for X-ray studies, so we assumed the NaCI type structure for this oxide as well. The result has revealed, as shown below, the atomic net charge, radial distribution, asphericity of electron density, and experimental atomic scattering factors. Crystal structure refinement. The crystals used for the present study were synthesized by Bernoulli method. Spheres with radii 0.155 mm, 0.105, 0.10, and 0.105 were prepared respectively from transparent crystals of MgO, MnO, CoO, and Ni0 and used for X-ray study. These crystals are pure and homogeneous within the analy-tical accuracy of EPMA, although trace amounts of Mn203 or Mn0.4 were detected from one of the Mn0 crystals by wet chemical analysis. The space group is Fm3m and the cell dimensions obtained from single crystal diffractometry (graphite monochromatized Mo Ka) are: a= 4.217(1)A for MgO; a=4.446 (1) for MnO; a=4.263 (1) for CoO; a-4.178(1) for NiO. The w-20 technique was used to collect, at tempera-ture 23.5±0.5° C, intensity data up to 20=157°, involving all equivalent reflections; a Syntex P21 diffractometer was used with bisecting mode for 20{\_}{\textless} 134° and parallel one for 134°{\textless}20{\textless} 157°. Of a total of 1200-1600 reflections measured for each of the four materials, independent reflections, 64, 74, 66 and 64 respectively for MgO, MnO, CoO, and NiO, were used for respective refinements after averaging all equi-valent reflections.

Using devices with different orientations, we demonstrate that the SMR response strongly depends on the direction of the charge current with respect to the magneto-crystalline anisotropies axis. We show that we can extract the anisotropies over a wide temperature range including across the Morin phase transition. We observe that the electrical response is dominated by the orientation of the antiferromagnetic N$\backslash$'eel order parameter, rather than by the emergent weak magnetic moment.

abstract = {We investigate the current-induced switching of the N{\'{e}}el order in NiO(001)/Pt heterostructures, which is manifested electrically via the spin Hall magnetoresistance. Significant reversible changes in the longitudinal and transverse resistances are found at room temperature for a current threshold lying in the range of 107 A/cm2. The order-parameter switching is ascribed to the antiferromagnetic dynamics triggered by the (current-induced) antidamping torque, which orients the N{\'{e}}el order towards the direction of the writing current. This is in stark contrast to the case of antiferromagnets such as Mn2Au and CuMnAs, where fieldlike torques induced by the Edelstein effect drive the N{\'{e}}el switching, therefore resulting in an orthogonal alignment between the N{\'{e}}el order and the writing current. Our findings can be readily generalized to other biaxial antiferromagnets, providing broad opportunities for all-electrical writing and readout in antiferromagnetic spintronics.},

@article{Moriyama2018,
abstract = {For a long time, there were no efficient ways of controlling antiferromagnets. Quite a strong magnetic field was required to manipulate the magnetic moments because of a high molecular field and a small magnetic susceptibility. It was also difficult to detect the orientation of the magnetic moments since the net magnetic moment is effectively zero. For these reasons, research on antiferromagnets has not been progressed as drastically as that on ferromagnets which are the main materials in modern spintronic devices. Here we show that the magnetic moments in NiO, a typical natural antiferromagnet, can indeed be controlled by the spin torque with a relatively small electric current density ({\~{}}4 × 107 A/cm2) and their orientation is detected by the transverse resistance resulting from the spin Hall magnetoresistance. The demonstrated techniques of controlling and detecting antiferromagnets would outstandingly promote the methodologies in the recently emerged “antiferromagnetic spintronics”. Furthermore, our results essentially lead to a spin torque antiferromagnetic memory.},

abstract = {Recent research demonstrated the electrical switching of antiferromagnets via intrinsic spin-orbit torque or the spin Hall effect of an adjacent heavy metal layer. The electrical readout is typically realized by measuring the transverse anisotropic magnetoresistance at planar cross- or star-shaped devices with four or eight arms, respectively. Depending on the material, the current density necessary to switch the magnetic state can be large, often close to the destruction threshold of the device. We demonstrate that the resulting electrical stress changes the film resistivity locally and thereby breaks the fourfold rotational symmetry of the conductor. This symmetry breaking due to film inhomogeneity produces signals, that resemble the anisotropic magnetoresistance and is experimentally seen as a “saw-tooth”-shaped transverse resistivity. This artifact can persist over many repeats of the switching experiment and is not easily separable from the magnetic contribution. We discuss the origin of the artifact, elucidate the role of the film crystallinity, and propose approaches how to separate the resistive contribution from the magnetic contribution.},

Here, we examine the origin of spin Hall magnetoresistance-like signals measured in a standard Hall bar geometry, which have recently been taken as evidence of current-induced switching of the antiferromagnetic order in Pt/AFI bilayers. We show that transverse voltage signals consistent with both the partial switching and toggle switching of the N{\'{e}}el vector in epitaxial Pt/NiO bilayers on Al2O3 are also present in Pt/Al2O3 in which the AFI is absent. We show that these signals have a thermal origin and arise from (i) transient changes in the current distribution due to nonuniform Joule heating and (ii) irreversible changes due to electromigration at elevated current densities, accompanied by long-term creep. These results suggest that more sophisticated techniques that directly probe the magnetic order are required to reliably exclude transport artifacts and thus infer information about the antiferromagnetic order in such systems.},

abstract = {We demonstrate the possibility to drive an antiferromagnetic domain wall at high velocities by fieldlike N{\'{e}}el spin-orbit torques. Such torques arise from current-induced local fields that alternate their orientation on each sublattice of the antiferromagnet and whose orientation depends primarily on the current direction, giving them their fieldlike character. The domain wall velocities that can be achieved by this mechanism are 2 orders of magnitude greater than the ones in ferromagnets. This arises from the efficiency of the staggered spin-orbit fields to couple to the order parameter and from the exchange-enhanced phenomena in antiferromagnetic texture dynamics, which leads to a low domain wall effective mass and the absence of a Walker breakdown limit. In addition, because of its nature, the staggered spin-orbit field can lift the degeneracy between two 180° rotated states in a collinear antiferromagnet, and it provides a force that can move such walls and control the switching of the states.},

DMI is known to generate noncollinear magnetic textures, and can take two forms in antiferromagnets: homogeneous or inter-sublattice, leading to small, canted moments and inhomogeneous or intra-sublattice, leading to formation of chiral structures. In this work, we first determine the strength of the effective field created by the DMI, using SQUID based magnetometry and transport measurements, in thin films of the antiferromagnetic iron oxide hematite, $\alpha$-Fe2O3. We demonstrate that DMI additionally introduces reconfigurability in the long distance magnon transport in these films under different orientations of a magnetic field. This arises as a hysteresis centred around the easy-axis direction for an external field rotated in opposing directions whose width decreases with increasing magnetic field as the Zeeman energy competes with the effective field created by the DMI.},

In this article, we report long-distance spin-transport in the easy-plane canted antiferromagnetic phase of hematite and at room temperature, where the linearly polarized magnons are not intuitively expected to carry spin. We demonstrate that the spin-transport signal decreases continuously through the easy-axis to easy-plane Morin transition, and persists in the easy-plane phase through current induced pairs of linearly polarized magnons with dephasing lengths in the micrometer range. We explain the long transport distance as a result of the low magnetic damping, which we measure to be ≤ 10 −5 as in the best ferromagnets. All of this together demonstrates that long-distance transport can be achieved across a range of anisotropies and temperatures, up to room temperature, highlighting the promising potential of this insulating antiferromagnet for magnon-based devices.},

In order to test some ideas concerning pure spin transport through insulating oxides, the present paper reports on the behaviour of two materials with very different properties: NiO is an antiferromagnet whereas SiO2 is a non-magnetic light element insulator. While a sizeable flow of angular momentum is found to be able to propagate through nickel oxide, a SiO2 layer as thin as 2 nm completely blocks this transfer. This underlines some essential features required to conduct a spin current, including the presence of either magnetic order through which magnons can propagate, or compounds with large spin-orbit interactions where phonons can carry angular momentum.},

@article{Keffer1957,
abstract = {The magnetic dipolar energy is computed for ordering of the second kind with the four antiferromagnetic sublattices of a facecentered cube making arbitrary spin directions with respect to one another, and this energy is shown to be of the same form in the sublattice direction cosines as is the calculated powder neutron-diffraction pattern. (The dipolar energy is also calculated for ordering of the third kind and shown to lead to a spin arrangement in disagreement with powder neutron-diffraction results on $\beta$ MnS.) The observed neutron patterns in MnO and $\alpha$ MnS agree with minimum dipolar energy, but many spin arrangements can satisfy this and the spins are constrained only to certain regions. Other sources of anisotropy in Mn++ salts are shown to be much weaker. A model is introduced in which the spins are constrained by dipolar and exchange forces to point parallel to (111) planes and constrained by the weaker anisotropy to a threefold set of easy axes within these planes. Nagamiya's small-field approximation for the field dependence of the powder susceptibility of a uniaxial antiferromagnet is extended to all values of the applied field, and a similar calculation is made for the powder susceptibility of our MnO model. Comparison with experimental data indicates that the weak within-plane anisotropy is ∼3×104 ergs/cm3 which is to be contrasted with the theoretical out-of-plane dipolar anisotropy of 107 ergs/cm3. A rough theory of antiferromagnetic resonance for our model seems to explain the partial paramagnetic-like absorption observed below the N{\'{e}}el point. {\textcopyright} 1957 The American Physical Society.},

@article{Hutchings1972,
abstract = {Inelastic neutron scattering techniques have been used to measure the spin-wave dispersion relations at 78°K in the fcc antiferromagnet NiO. The energy dispersion has a steep initial slope (∼250 meV ) and a high maximum energy (∼117 meV) and is further characterized by a relatively low zone boundary energy in certain directions. The exchange parameters defined by H1,2=JjS→(1)•S→(2) were determined by fitting the theoretical expression for the spin-wave energies to the experimental data corrected for instrumental resolution effects. The predominant interaction is a large antiferromagnetic exchange J2=221°K (19.01 meV) between next-nearest neighbors, which are linked by a 180°superexchange path. The interaction between nearest neighbors, linked by a 90°Ni2+-O2 - Ni2+ configuration, is much smaller and ferromagnetic in sign, J1=-15.9°K (-1.37 meV). A consequence of the relatively small value of J1 is that the spin waves from the four domains present in the sample can only be resolved in a limited region of reciprocal space. These values of exchange interactions are in accord with simple ideas of covalency and overlap, and the results emphasize the behavior of NiO as a weakly covalent insulator. The density of magnon states, estimates of the transition temperature, and several thermomagnetic properties of NiO have been calculated from the measured exchange parameters using molecular field and random-phase-approximation Green's-function formulas. {\textcopyright} 1972 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {As first noted by N{\'{e}}el, antiferromagnetic nanoparticles could exhibit superparamagnetic relaxation of their spin lattices is well as permanent moments arising from uncompensated surface spins. Several samples of antiferromagnetic NiO nanoparticles with average sizes ranging from 50 to {\textgreater} 800 {\AA} were investigated in the present study. In addition to the inverse dependence on avenge particle size of the susceptibility predicted by N{\'{e}}el. and previously reported, some unusual behavior was observed. Above the blocking temperatures (TB) of the particles, the reversible magnetization could not be fit with a Langevin function that was consistent with the physically reasonable moment representing the uncompensated spins. For the 53 {\AA} diameter particles, both zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) loops below TB exhibit large coercive forces (several kOe) and the loops showed irreversibility up to 50 kOe. In addition, in the FC state below TB the hysteresis loops were strongly shifted. The latter behavior may be due to exchange coupling of the uncompensated spins with the antiferromagnetic core. However, the large coercive forces and high field irreversibility which accompany the shifted loops raise new questions about the nature of the uncompensated spins. The magnetization relaxation of these particles is also discussed. {\textcopyright} 1997 American Institute of Physics.},

In particular, the thinner tBE makes dissipation of Joule heat less efficient, so the filaments will be at a higher temperature and become less stable.

abstract = {Temperature-dependent Raman scattering by two magnons has been observed in both green and black (from excess oxygen) NiO single crystals, peaking at 1555 cm-1 at 1.4°K. The shape of the band is reasonably well described by a dominant intersublattice exchange of J2=148 cm-1, in excellent agreement with the value J2=153 cm-1, obtained from neutron scattering.1 The high-frequency cutoff of the Raman scattering lies near 1900 cm-1 in agreement with the J1=0 two-magnon joint density-of-states cutoff at 176 cm-1. The absorption line2 peaking at 1940 cm-1 has been reexamined in light of this data, and is found to exhibit a cutoff on the high-frequency side at 2460 cm-1, and a threshold near the peak of the Raman scattering. These data support a model for the absorption band in which two magnons are created simultaneously with a photon, with the cutoff corresponding to the creation of two zone boundary magnons and an L0 phonon of 580 cm-1 at k=0. Such a phonon sideband of a two-magnon transition probably derives its intensity from the phonon modulation of exchange as suggested by Koide et al.3 {\textcopyright} 1971 The American Institute of Physics.},

In these cases Al- and Ga-atoms, respectively, segregate from the substrate and react with adsorbed oxygen. The grown Al- and Ga-oxide films, respectively, order at elevated temperatures.

abstract = {{Neutron diffraction intensities have been computed for antiferromagnetic spin arrangements in the rock-salt-type structure. D the spin directions in the unit cell occur at relative angles other than 0' or 180', the neutron scattering from powder specimens does not lead to a unique solution of the spin arrangement. A unique solution can be obtained from neutron scattering by a single-domain crystal. Neutron diffraction from crystals of nickel oxide shows that in all crystals examined, either the magnetic moments were parallel to more than one direction in the crystal, or antiferromagnetic domains were present. The results can be quantitatively accounted for by assuming the crystal consisted of domains with a common magnetic axis. HE application of neutron diffraction methods now makes it possible to arrive at descriptions of the detailed arrangement of atomic moments in magnetic solids. Below a critical ordering temperature, there may arise a three-dimensional periodic arrange-ment of moments which superimposes a characteristic magnetic structure upon the original crystal structure. In a recent paper' the results of a neutron diffraction investigation by powder methods of the antiferro-magnetic ordering in MnO, FeO, CoO, and XiO were reported. The interpretation of the neutron diffraction patterns was based on the assumption that within a single magnetic unit cell the atomic moments were parallel or antiparallel to a single magnetic axis. It was concluded that the structures of all the monoxides were based on ferromagnetic sheets of moments parallel to (111) planes, with the direction of magnetization reversed on adjacent sheets. The most probable axis of magnetization for FeO was along the [111]direction perpendicular to the ferromagnetic sheet, whereas for MnO, and NiO the most probable direction lay within the ferromagnetic sheet. The observation of diffuse neutron scattering left some uncertainty regarding the precise direction of the magnetic axes, and consequently there was the possibility of a tilt of the moment direc-tion out of the (111)plane toward the [001]direction, particularly in the case of CoO. A crystallographic deformation occurs at the same temperature as the magnetic ordering. In the para-magnetic state, the oxides are cubic; upon passing into the antiferromagnetic state, MnO and NiO become rhombohedral with n)60', FeO rhombohedral with n(60', and CoO tetragonal with c/a(1. '' The ar-rangement of moments in MnO, NiO, and FeO is con-sistent with the crystal deformation in the sense that the unique crystal axis is perpendicular to the ferro-magnetically coupled sheets. This simple correlation is absent for CoO. Since Pin+' is in an 5 state and the orbital moment of Ni+' is quenched by the crystalline 6eld, dipole-dipole interactions favor the moments * Neutron diffraction experiments were made at the Brookhaven National Laboratory Reactor, Upton, New York.

Rooksby, Nature 165, 442 (1950). lying within (111)planes' in. agreement with the neutron diffraction results. The orbital contributions to the moment of Co+' is appreciable, however, and from recent calculations, Kanamori' concludes that the magnetic axis should be nearly parallel to the tetragonal [001] axis. On the other hand, calculations by Loch and Goodenough' show that minimum dipole energies may also be obtained from more complex types of spin configurations in which the atomic spins form angles other than 0' or 180' with each other. In the previous work it was pointed out that although a set of solutions could be deduced which was consistent with data limited to neutron diffraction from powder specimens, these solutions were not unique since they depended on certain basic assumptions which limited the range of possible structures. It is the purpose of this paper to explore the consequence of removing the re-striction that there is a single magnetic axis in a domain of an antiferromagnet and consequently to generalize the problem to include the multimagnetic-axis struc-tures. As a result of this generalization, it is found that a variety of multiaxis arrangements are consistent with data obtainable from powder specimens. Further calculations showed that neutron diffraction from a single crystal which consists of a single antiferrornag-netic domain could be used to differentiate between the alternative arrangements. Nickel oxide was chosen as a suitable material to investigate, and neutron scat-tering experiments were undertaken in order to as-certain the angular distribution of spin directions within the magnetic unit cell. NEUTRON DIFFRACTION POWDER PATTERNS FROM MULTIAXIS STRUCTURES The theory of the scattering of neutrons by atomic moments has been given by Halpern and Johnson. " In their analysis of the coherent diffraction pattern produced by scattering from an ordered arrangement of 4 S. 773 moments, the magnetic moments were assumed parallel or antiparallel. An extension of the original analysis required to compute the scattering from moments making arbitrary angles with each other in a rocksalt-type structure is given in the appendix. A general formulation for the description of the possible magnetic structures in the rocksalt-like oxides is shown in Fig. 1. The atomic spins are arrayed in four antiferromagnetic substructures 3f jj (j=1, 2, 3, 4) such that if the spin direction of atom j is S;=Le,v,w;), the spin on atom j' is reversed and S; = — S;= [uAm, j. In the general case, it is assumed there is no relationship between the magnetization directions of the sub-structures, and hence to uniquely de6ne the spin structure in an unit cell (or a single domain) it is necessary to prescribe the four spin vectors S,.

abstract = {In this paper, we show the coexistence of the bipolar and unipolar resistive-switching modes in NiO cells realized using an optimized oxidation process of a Ni blanket layer used as the bottom electrode. The two switching modes can be activated independent of the cell switching history provided the appropriate programming conditions are applied. The bipolar and unipolar switching modes are discussed as driven by electrochemical- and thermal-based mechanisms, respectively. The switching versatility between these two modes is demonstrated both for large oxidized Ni films and for Ni films oxidized at the bottom of small dimension contact holes. The perspective of selecting the desired switching mode in a scaled device made in a small diameter single hole is highly attractive because the specific advantages of the two modes broaden the application scope of the cell and enable larger flexibility in terms of memory architecture. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Recent demonstrations of electrical detection and manipulation of antiferromagnets (AFMs) have opened new opportunities toward robust and ultrafast spintronics devices. However, it is difficult to establish the connection between the spin-transport behavior and the microscopic AFM domain states in thin films due to the lack of a real-time imaging technique under the electric field. Here we report a large magneto-optical birefringence effect with polarization rotation up to 60 millidegrees in thin NiO(001) films at room temperature. Such large optical polarization rotation allows us to directly observe AFM domains in thin-film NiO by utilizing a wide-field optical microscope. Complementary x-ray magnetic linear dichroism-photoemission electron microscopy measurement further confirms that the optical contrast is related to the NiO AFM domain. We examine the domain pattern evolution at a wide range of temperatures and with the application of external magnetic field. Comparing to large-scale-facility techniques such as x-ray photoemission electron microscopy, using a wide-field, tabletop optical imaging method in reflection geometry enables straightforward access to domain configurations of single-layer AFMs.},

abstract = {Low-temperature solution processing opens a new window for the fabrication of oxide semiconductors due to its simple, low cost, and large-area uniformity. Herein, by using solution combustion synthesis (SCS), p-type Cu-doped NiO (Cu:NiO) thin films are fabricated at a temperature lower than 150 °C. The light doping of Cu substitutes the Ni site and disperses the valence band of the NiO matrix, leading to an enhanced p-type conductivity. Their integration into thin-film transistors (TFTs) demonstrates typical p-type semiconducting behavior. The optimized Cu5{\%}NiO TFT exhibits outstanding electrical performance with a hole mobility of 1.5 cm2 V−1 s−1, a large on/off current ratio of ≈104, and clear switching characteristics under dynamic measurements. The employment of a high-k ZrO2 gate dielectric enables a low operating voltage (≤2 V) of the TFTs, which is critical for portable and battery-driven devices. The construction of a light-emitting-diode driving circuit demonstrates the high current control capability of the resultant TFTs. The achievement of the low-temperature-processed Cu:NiO thin films via SCS not only provides a feasible approach for low-cost flexible p-type oxide electronics but also represents a significant step toward the development of complementary metal–oxide semiconductor circuits.},

The core-level and valence-level photoemission spectra, as well as the work function and energy-level alignment with a common hole-injection material, have been measured using X-ray photoemission spectroscopy and ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy. We found that in situ oxidation results in the formation of a purely NiO film, while ex situ oxidation and air exposure result in a hydroxide-terminated NiO film. Work functions as high as 6.7 eV can be achieved for in situ-oxidized NiO; however, the work function decreases rapidly with time due to adsorption of residual gases in vacuum. The work functions of ex situ and air-exposed NiO were significantly lower, between 5.2 and 5.6 eV, due to hydroxylation of the oxide surface. We have examined the rate at which the work function decreases with air exposure and found there to be a very rapid initial decrease in work function, followed by a much slower continual decline. Despite the decrease in work function, energy-level alignment of $\alpha$-NPD is not affected until the work function drops below a threshold value. We have also examined the effect of vacuum annealing of NiO and found that it becomes highly defective with oxygen vacancies, causing the Fermi level position of the oxide to move away from the valence band maximum and decreasing the work function. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Chemical Society.},

General trends of the effects of electron correlation and the treatment of exchange on the calculated properties are observed. None of the standard methods considered provided results in agreement with experimental data for all properties. A combination of Becke's three-parameter exchange functional and the Lee-Yang-Parr correlation functional (B3LYP) leads to a consistent description of the electronic and structural properties in comparative studies of the three compounds. Other methods are more accurate than B3LYP if certain properties or compounds are considered. The combination of the Hartree-Fock exchange functional with the Lee-Yang-Parr density-functional correlation is the best method for the open-shell transition-metal oxides NiO and CoO in terms of relative stability and geometry and the electronic structure of the valence band. The absolute values of calculated heats of atomization, however, are generally too small. The density-functional method based on the Perdew-Wang generalized gradient approximation (PWGGA) is preferable for the calculation of thermodynamic properties for all compounds but is less reliable in the prediction of structural and electronic properties.

Moreover, by utilizing a structure with separated writing current paths and Hall cross area, the quadratic relationship between $\Delta$Rxy and the writing current's amplitude is observed, which provides quantitative evidence of the thermal contribution.

Understanding the switching properties of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) domain state is critical for developing AFM spintronics. By utilizing the magneto-optical birefringence effect, we experimentally demonstrate the switching rate of the AFM domain can be enhanced by more than 2 orders of magnitude through applying an alternating square-wave field on a single crystalline Fe/CoO bilayer. The observed extraordinary speed can be much faster than that triggered by a constant field with the same amplitude. The effect can be understood as the efficient suppression of the pinning of AFM domain walls by the strong exchange torque triggered by the reversal of the Fe magnetization, as revealed by spin dynamics simulations. Our finding opens up new opportunities to design the antiferromagnet-based spintronic devices utilizing the ferromagnet-antiferromagnet heterostructure.},

The T walls can be observed with polarized light, and both T- and S-type domains can be studied by neutron diffraction. Crystals with simple T-wall structures are produced by annealing at high temperature. The crystallography of the T walls can be understood in terms of a small rhombohedral deformation which accompanies the antiferromagnetic ordering. The T walls are easily displaced by the application of small mechanical stresses or magnetic fields. A crystal without T walls may still contain S walls, and these S walls also are displaced or rotated by magnetic fields. {\textcopyright} 1960 The American Institute of Physics.},

Optical pumping and probing with linearly and circularly polarized light along the optic axis of the NiO crystal scrutinizes the mechanism behind the ultrafast magnon excitation. A phenomenological symmetry-based theory links these experimental results to expressions for the optically induced magnetization via the inverse Faraday effect and the inverse Cotton-Mouton effect. We obtain striking agreement between experiment and theory that, furthermore, allows us to extract information about the spin domain distribution. We also find that in NiO the energy transfer into the magnon mode via the inverse Cotton-Mouton effect is about three orders of magnitude more efficient than via the inverse Faraday effect.},

For instance, the absence of net magnetization and stray fields eliminates crosstalk between neighbouring devices, and the absence of a primary macroscopic magnetization makes spin manipulation in antiferromagnets inherently faster than in ferromagnets. However, control of spins in antiferromagnets requires exceedingly high magnetic fields, and antiferromagnetic order cannot be detected with conventional magnetometry. Here we provide an overview and illustrative examples of how electromagnetic radiation can be used for probing and modification of the magnetic order in antiferromagnets. We also discuss possible research directions that are anticipated to be among the main topics defining the future of this rapidly developing field.},

abstract = {A determination of the three-dimensional spin directions in all types of domain walls (DWs) of antiferromagnetic NiO has been successfully performed by photoemission electron microscopy combined with x-ray magnetic linear dichroism (XMLD), both for s- and p-polarized light. By comparing the azimuthal angle dependence of the XMLD contrast in the DWs with cluster model calculations which include the crystal symmetry and full-multiplet splitting, we determine the spin structures in the {\{}001{\}} T walls, {\{}011{\}} T walls, 120° S walls, and 180° S walls. In some cases, distinct S walls are not formed between two adjacent S domains, and the spin direction changes gradually over a wide range of the S domain structures. In the S walls, the spin direction is parallel to the magnetic easy {\{}111{\}} plane. These spin configurations arise from the large difference in anisotropy energy between the in-plane and out-of-plane directions. Unexpectedly large widths in the several hundred nanometer range were observed for all the DWs. This also shows that NiO has a small magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy. Together with Monte Carlo simulation results, the qualitative phenomena concerning the wall energies are discussed. We further investigated the difference in wall energy between the {\{}001{\}} T wall and the {\{}011{\}} T wall.

@article{Armstrong2009,
abstract = {The present study shows that antiferromagnetic spin and twin domain walls govern the hysteretic expressions of exchange anisotropy at low and high fields, respectively, using annealed NiO single crystals and Co. In the presence of twin walls, spin walls are shown to be a geometrical necessity in the antiferromagnetic NiO. A threshold field (∼10000Oe) exists below which twin walls are frozen, and rotational hysteresis is dominated by losses due to spin walls. Above the threshold field, twin walls become mobile, resulting in a sharp increase in rotational hysteresis. Remarkably, rotational hysteresis associated with spin walls is similar to that of an ordinary ferromagnet-as the field strength increases, rotational hysteresis tends toward zero. However, unlike an ordinary ferromagnet where rotational hysteresis becomes zero above its saturation field, rotational hysteresis in antiferromagnet drops but then sharply increases once the threshold field for twin wall motion is exceeded. In crystals without spin walls, low-field rotational hysteresis is zero or negligible. Domain imaging of twin walls in antiferromagnet and Weiss walls in ferromagnet reveals a one-to-one spatial correlation even though twin walls are considered to have no net dipoles. This surprising result is explained by the fact that crystallographic interfaces in real crystals are not atomically sharp or ideal, and the defective interface invariably results in net moment across the finite width of the twin wall. The field dependence of domain walls in Co film exchange coupled to NiO shows global similarities to previously reported behavior of Co films deposited on nanocrystalline NiO. In both cases, domain wall motion is not the dominant mode of magnetization reversal (wall motion is entirely absent in the present study while wall motion was only occasionally observed in the previous study), reversal occurs abruptly and different regions switch at different fields, and the observed pinning sites are frozen in the applied field range. Despite vastly different underlying microstructure of NiO in these two studies (annealed NiO single crystal with a fixed orientation across the NiO-Co interface in the present study versus nanocrystalline NiO in the previous study), the observed similarities may be understood by recognizing that, just as crystallographically imperfect twin interfaces serve as pinning sites for walls in Co film, other defects can play a similar role. Practically, results provide means of tuning rotational hysteresis by varying the type and the density of domain walls in NiO and by tuning the saturation field of the ferromagnet relative to the threshold field for the twin wall motion. {\textcopyright} 2009 The American Physical Society.},

We find that the presence and the type of strain strongly conditions the dipolar anisotropy, while the finite thickness introduces an additional perturbation to the dipolar energy, similar to the well known shape anisotropy of ferromagnetic films, with sizable effects due to surface roughness. An analytic expression relating the strain and thickness contributions to the dipolar anisotropy is derived from first-order perturbation theory, showing that in films with degenerate moment directions different domains can be stabilized by different combinations of tetragonal strain and thickness. Our predictions are in good qualitative agreement with the magnetic domain structure of strained NiO(001) films recently measured by x-ray magnetic linear dichroism. {\textcopyright} 2003 The American Physical Society.},

Emphasis was on the study of the oxide layer misfit strain. Primary beam diffraction modulated electron emission and low energy electron diffraction experiments allowed the determination of the in-plane and out-of-plane strain in the oxide layer, while scanning tunneling microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and secondary electron imaging have been used to monitor the film morphology, stoichiometry and structure, respectively. The film strain begins to be removed at a critical thickness of 10 ML, while at 20 ML the film is fully relaxed. Strain analysis indicates that the Poisson ratio of the oxide layer is nearly equal to that of the bulk material. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

In practice, however, owing to the existence of kinetic barriers, much thicker coherent layers may often be grown. We present a systematic study of the relaxation behaviour of NiO(00l) layers (from 160 up to 1600 {\AA} in thickness), grown by molecular beam epitaxy on MgO(00l) substrates. Ex situ X-ray specular reflectivity measurements determined the layer thickness and interface roughness. Relaxation of the NiO lattice parameter was detected with X-ray diffraction via reciprocal-space maps about non-specular diffraction peaks common to the substrate and overlayer. The Poisson ratio for NiO was experimentally determined to be 0.21. A comparison with theoretical predictions of the relaxation behaviour for NiO on MgO is made. {\textcopyright} 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The relation between the symmetry of electron orbitals and superexchange interaction is discussed. It is shown that the sign of the superexchange interaction is closely connected with the cation orbital state, when the cation is subject to the crystalline field arising from octahedrally or tetrahedrally surrounding anions. In some cases, the sign of the superexchange interaction is definitely determined from the symmetry relations. The cases in which each cation is subject to an octahedral cubic field and the lines connecting the interacting cations to the intervening anion make an angle of either 180° or 90° are discussed in particular. Our discussion of the 180° case is applicable to crystals of the perovskite type and NaCl type and that of the 90° case to anhydrous chlorides. In the case where each cation is subject to a tetrahedral cubic field, there is a definite relation between the symmetry of the cation electron orbitals and superexchange interaction, if only the s-orbital of anion participates in the superexchange interaction. TiH2 is an example of this case. The interaction between nearest-neighbor cations in the crystal of the NaCl type is also discussed. {\textcopyright} 1959.},

In the case of compounds containing Cu 2+ or Mn3+ at octahedral sites, the lowest orbital level of these ions is doubly degenerate in the undistorted structure, and there is no spin-orbit coupling in this level. It is shown that, introducing a fictitious spin to specify the degenerate orbital states, we can discuss the problem by analogy with the magnetic problems. The "ferromagnetic" and "antiferromagnetic" distortions are discussed in detail. The transition from the distorted to the undistorted structure is of the first kind for the former and of the second kind for the latter. Higher approximations are discussed briefly. In compounds like FeO, CoO, and CuCr2O 4, the lowest orbital level is triply degenerate, and the spin-orbit coupling is present in this level. In this case the distortion is dependent on the magnitude of the spin-orbit coupling relative to the strength of the Jahn-Teller effect term. The distortion at absolute zero temperature and its temperature dependence are discussed. {\textcopyright} 1960 The American Institute of Physics.},

In their crystalline field of cubic symmetry the orbital degeneracies of Fe++ and Co++ are not completely removed and the residual orbital angular momenta play an important role through the presence of the spin-orbit coupling and through the direct effect of the orbital magnetic moments. After deriving the effective Hamiltonian for these degenerate cases, which corresponds to the Hamiltonian derived by Pryce for the non-degenerate case, we discuss the paramagnetic susceptibility, the N{\'{e}}el temperature and the state of each ion at absolute zero. We can give a reasonable quantitative interpretation of the susceptibility of CoO in paramagnetic state and obtain a good agreement with experiment for the magnetic moment of CoO in antiferromagnetic state. For FeO, sufficiently reliable data to compare with theory are not available at present, but a preliminary comparison is made. Further, in connection with the investigation of the validity of our theory, the origins of the crystalline field are discussed and it is pointed out that the covalent effect may make an appreciable contribution to the crystalline field.},

abstract = {We report high-resolution observations of antiferromagnetic (AF) domain walls at the surface of NiO and determine the typical width of AF walls in this material to be of the order of 150 nm. We observe a number of different types of domain walls, including double walls caused by long-range interaction between walls. We describe the observed wall profiles by a model containing the exchange interaction and magnetostriction as basic ingredients. The good agreement of this model with experiment shows that the formation of walls between antiferromagnetic domains in NiO and their properties are dominated by magnetoelastic interactions. {\textcopyright} 2003 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Co/NiO/Fe trilayers are grown on Ag(001) substrate using molecular-beam epitaxy and investigated by element-specific magnetic domain images using x-ray magnetic circular dichroism and x-ray magnetic linear dichroism techniques. By comparing the Co, Fe, and NiO magnetic domain images, we identify that the anomalous Co-Fe interlayer coupling from a 90° coupling to a collinear coupling with increasing the NiO film thickness is due to a transition from a collinear to 90° coupling at the NiO/Fe interface while retaining a 90° coupling at the Co/NiO interface. Uncompensated Ni spins are found at the Co/NiO interface but are absent at the NiO/Fe interface. No evidence of spiral NiO spin structure is found in this Co/NiO/Fe sandwich. {\textcopyright} 2009 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {We demonstrate how shape-induced strain can be used to control antiferromagnetic order in NiO/Pt thin films. For rectangular elements patterned along the easy and hard magnetocrystalline anisotropy axes of our film, we observe different domain structures and we identify magnetoelastic interactions that are distinct for different domain configurations. We reproduce the experimental observations by modeling the magnetoelastic interactions, considering spontaneous strain induced by the domain configuration, as well as elastic strain due to the substrate and the shape of the patterns. This allows us to demonstrate and explain how the variation of the aspect ratio of rectangular elements can be used to control the antiferromagnetic ground state domain configuration. Shape-dependent strain does not only need to be considered in the design of antiferromagnetic devices, but can potentially be used to tailor their properties, providing an additional handle to control antiferromagnets.},

abstract = {Some aspects of the dynamical behaviour of S walls are studied at room temperature through in situ optical observations performed on vapour-grown NiO (111) platelets in a magnetic field. The field is applied in the plane of the platelets, i.e., in the easy plane of magnetisation, by changing its strength and/or direction. The observations give direct confirmation of the occurrence of spin flopping for a field above about 15.4 kOe; hence the anisotropy energy associated with the easy axes of magnetisation within the easy plane is estimated as 42 erg g-1. The observations also give information concerning the field strength necessary for creating S walls in single S domain platelets, and for displacing S walls in multiple S domain platelets. This information is used to evaluate the formation energy and coercivity of S walls.},

@article{Gomonay2014,
abstract = {High fraction of the surface atoms considerably enhances the influence of size and shape on the magnetic and electronic properties of nanoparticles. Shape effects in ferromagnetic nanoparticles are well understood and allow us to set and control the parameters of a sample that affect its magnetic anisotropy during production. In the present paper we study the shape effects in the other widely used magnetic materials - antiferromagnets, - which possess vanishingly small or zero macroscopic magnetization. We take into account the difference between the surface and bulk magnetic anisotropy of a nanoparticle and show that the effective magnetic anisotropy depends on the particle shape and crystallographic orientation of its faces. The corresponding shape-induced contribution to the magnetic anisotropy energy is proportional to the particle volume, depends on magnetostriction, and can cause formation of equilibrium domain structure. Crystallographic orientation of the nanoparticle surface determines the type of domain structure. The proposed model allows us to predict the magnetic properties of antiferromagnetic nanoparticles depending on their shape and treatment. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Such devices aim to make use of the insensitivity to external magnetic fields and the ultrafast dynamics at the picosecond timescale intrinsic to antiferromagnets. The possibility to electrically switch antiferromagnets was first predicted for Mn2Au and then experimentally observed in tetragonal CuMnAs. Here, we report on the electrical switching and detection of the Neel order in epitaxial films of Mn2Au. The exponential dependences of the switching amplitude on the current density and the temperature are explained by a macroscopic thermal activation model taking into account the effect of the Joule heating in Hall cross devices and we observe that the thermal activation plays a key role in the reorientation process of the Neel order. Our model analysis shows that the electrically set Neel-state is long-term stable at room temperature, paving the way for practical applications in memory devices.},

abstract = {In this work we present a comprehensive study of the domain structure of a nickel oxide single crystal grown by floating zone melting and suggest a correlation between point defects and the observed domain structure. The properties and structure of domains dictate the dynamics of resistive switching, water splitting and gas sensing, to name but a few. Investigating the correlation between point defects and domain structure can provide a deeper understanding of their formation and structure, which potentially allows one to tailor domain structure and the dynamics of the aforementioned applications. A range of inhomogeneities are observed by diffraction and microscopy techniques. X-ray and low-energy electron diffraction reveal domains on the submicron- and nanometer-scales, respectively. In turn, these domains are visualised by atomic force and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), respectively. A comprehensive transmission electron microscopy (TEM) study reveals inhomogeneities ranging from domains of varying size, misorientation of domains, variation of the lattice constant and bending of lattice planes. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electron energy-loss spectroscopy indicate the crystal is Ni deficient. Density functional theory calculations—considering the spatial and electronic disturbance induced by the favourable nickel vacancy—reveal a nanoscale distortion comparable to STM and TEM observations. The different inhomogeneities are understood in terms of the structural relaxation induced by ordering of nickel vacancies, which is predicted to be favourable.},

abstract = {The combination of soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy with photoemission electron microscopy (X-PEEM) provides a powerful tool for imaging the domain structure in magnetically ordered systems. Using linearly polarized X-rays in the PEEM-3 microscope of the Advanced Light Source, we have investigated the antiferromagnetic (AFM) domain patterns in LaFeO3 thin films and nanostructures. Embedded nanostructures with AFM order were defined using a structuring technique which relies on local disruption of the magnetic order by Ar+ ion implantation. We demonstrate that extended AFM domains can be stabilized along the edges of such embedded nanostructures, when the edges are aligned with AFM easy axes in the thin film material. Detailed analysis of the magnetic linear dichroism in polarization-dependent X-PEEM data from LaFeO 3/La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 bilayers shows stabilization of multiple degenerate easy axes of the LaFeO3 layer. We argue that the extra set of easy axes, not present in LaFeO3 grown directly on a cubic substrate (i.e., SrTiO3), arises from structural coupling to the La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 buffer layer, acting as the effective substrate. Finally, we demonstrate how the combination of this structural perturbation and nanoscale patterning may be exploited to selectively stabilize extended AFM domains along either of the available easy axes. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Magnetic micro- and nanostructures are of high interest for industrial applications. However, many phenomena employed in magnetic devices require better understanding. For instance, the unidirectional coupling of a ferromagnet to an adjacent antiferromagnet, referred to as exchange bias effect, is not fully understood even though it has been known for five decades. Spatially-resolved magnetic, elemental, and chemical information about the ferro-/antiferromagnetic interface is required in order to solve the exchange bias puzzle. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and XAS-based magnetic microscopy techniques such as the photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) are uniquely able to provide this information. In the present work, the magnetic domain structure of thin films and multilayers is examined. The main aim of this thesis is to study the role of the magnetic domains in the exchange bias effect. In order to address the complexity of this effect, the studies were carried out in three steps: studying the ferromagnetic (FM) system, the antiferromagnetic (AF) system and finally the AF/FM bilayers. For the FM studies, cobalt and Permalloy films were deposited as a wedge on top of pre-patterned silicon substrates using dc magnetron sputtering and evaporation, respectively resulting in an array of structures surrounded by a continuous film beneath. The FM domain structure as a function of the film thickness of the continuous and the patterned films was studied using the PEEM. In addition, effects of surface roughness 6 on the magnetic domain structure are discussed. This work provides important information of how various parameters, such as thickness, substrate roughness or patterning, influence the FM domain structure in thin films. For the AF studies, thin LaFeO3 films were grown using pulsed laser deposition (PLD) on SrTiO3 substrates. Continuous and patterned LaFeO3 films were studied. The patterning was carried out by either growing the films on pre-patterned substrates or post-patterning (i.e. patterning the film after deposition) using either a combination of electron beam lithography and ion-milling or focused ion beam lithography. The PEEM has been used to determine the orientation of individual antiferromagnetic domains in LaFeO3 thin films. We found the antiferromagnetic axes are tilted by 20° out of the surface plane and have a different sign of the x-ray magnetic linear dichroism compared to previous reports on LaFeO3. Using multiplet calculations, we show that this sign depends on the orientation of the magnetization with respect to the crystalline axes. Furthermore, we found that the AF and crystallographic domains in the LaFeO3 films are one-to-one correlated. Finally, we found that the AF domain structure remains unaffected by the patterning. We have obtained initial results on a LaFeO3/Co exchange bias system. Indications for pinned uncompensated moments in the LaFeO3 film without Co and for free uncompensated moments in the LaFeO3/Co system were obtained. First measurements of the AF/FM domain correlation were carried out and the ability to perform PEEM measurements in applied magnetic fields was proven. This work highlights the importance of the magnetic domain structure for the understanding of the exchange bias phenomenon. Our findings shed light on the mystery of the magnetic domain formation in thin films and nanostructures},

abstract = {It is of common knowledge that the direction of easy axis in the finite-size ferromagnetic sample is controlled by its shape. In the present paper we show that a similar phenomenon should be observed in the compensated antiferromagnets with strong magnetoelastic coupling. Destressing energy which originates from the long-range magnetoelastic forces is analogous to demagnetization energy in ferromagnetic materials and is responsible for the formation of equilibrium domain structure and anisotropy of macroscopic magnetic properties. In particular, crystal shape may be a source of additional uniaxial magnetic anisotropy which removes degeneracy of antiferromagnetic vector or artificial 4th order anisotropy in the case of a square cross-section sample. In a special case of antiferromagnetic nanopillars shape-induced anisotropy can be substantially enhanced due to lattice mismatch with the substrate. These effects can be detected by the magnetic rotational torque and antiferromagnetic resonance measurements.},

Significant impact on the AFM domain configuration was observed. Extended domains were found to form along edges parallel to the in-plane 〈100〉 crystalline axes of the cubic substrate, with their AFM spin axis parallel to the edge. No such edge-imposed domain configuration was found for nanoislands defined with the edges at 45° with the in-plane crystalline axes. Epitaxial constraints on the film crystalline structure appear to play an important role in the formation of the edge-bound extended AFM domains.

Here, we first report the detection of the average Neel vector orientiation in polycrystalline NiO via spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR). Secondly, by applying strain through a piezo-electric substrate, we reduce the critical magnetic field required to reach a saturation of the SMR signal, indicating a change of the anisotropy. Our results are consistent with polycrystalline NiO exhibiting a positive sign of the in-plane magnetostriction.

The total winding number of the topological texture can be configured from - 1 to 3 by selective non-local electric switching of the quadrant domains. By using angle-resolved piezoresponse force microscopy in conjunction with local winding number analysis, we directly identify the existence of vortices and anti-vortices, observe pair creation and annihilation and manipulate the net number of vortices.

abstract = {The mechanism of formation of the equilibrium domain structure during a thermoelastic phase transition is proposed. This mechanism is related to long-range elastic strain fields created by "elastic charges" at the free crystal surface. It is assumed that, during a phase transition, there appears not only the nonzero primary (antiferromagnetic, martensitic) order parameter in the crystal but also an internal (quasi-plastic) stress rigidly related to the order parameter. The orientation of this stress with respect to the crystallographic axes can be changed by external fields. Elastic charges arise due to those components of the internal stress tensor whose flux across the crystal surface is nonzero. The nonlocal destressing energy is found. It is shown that, for a certain shape of a sample, an inhomogeneous distribution of the primary order parameter (a domain structure) is energetically more favorable. The characteristic field at which a sample becomes a single domain is shown to be dependent on the shape of the crystal. {\textcopyright} 2005 Pleiades Publishing, Inc.},

We assume that the microstress tensors arise locally at each crystallographic site along with the magnetic order parameter due to magnetoelastic coupling. Formally, these tensors are equivalent to the elastic dipoles and, like the magnetic dipoles in ferromagnets, produce long-range elastic fields whose contribution to the thermodynamic potential may be reduced by the formation of an equilibrium domain structure. In analogy with ferromagnets, the energy contribution which arises from the interaction between the elastic dipoles favors reduction of macroscopic deformation of the sample and may be called «destressing» energy.

@article{VanDerLaan2011,
abstract = {Photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) with linearly polarized x rays is used to determine the orientation of antiferromagnetic domains by monitoring the relative peak intensities at the 3d transition metal L2 absorption edge. In such an analysis it is necessary to take into account the orientations of the x-ray polarization E and magnetization H with respect to the crystalline axes. We address this problem by presenting a general expression of the angular dependence for both x-ray absorption (XA) spectroscopy and x-ray magnetic linear dichroism (XMLD) for arbitrary directions of E and H in the (001) cubic plane. In cubic symmetry the angular-dependent XMLD is a linear combination of two spectra with different photon energy dependencies. As a result the intensity maxima of the XA and XMLD are no longer found for E parallel to H and their directions will vary with photon energy. When E or H is along a high-symmetry axis there is only one spectrum. The angular-dependent XMLD can be separated into an isotropic part, which is symmetric around H, and an anisotropic part, which depends on the orientation of the crystal axes. The anisotropic part has maximal intensity when E and H have equal but opposite angles with respect to the [100] direction. The Ni2+ L2 edge has the peculiarity that the isotropic part vanishes, which has the interesting consequence that the maximum in the XMLD intensity is obtained not only for E H [100] but also for (E [110], H [110]). We apply the angular-dependent theory to determine the spin orientation near the Co/NiO(100) interface. The PEEM images show that the ferromagnetic Co spins and antiferromagnetic NiO spins are aligned perpendicular to each other. By rotating the sample with respect to the linear x-ray polarization we furthermore find that the perpendicular coupling with the ferromagnetic Co layer at the interface causes a canting of the antiferromagnetic Ni moments. This shows that taking into account the angular dependence of the XMLD in the detailed analysis of PEEM images can lead to an accurate retrieval of the spin axes of the antiferromagnetic domains. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Magnetic proximity effect between two magnetic layers is an important focus of research for discovering new physical properties of magnetic systems. Antiferromagnets (AFMs) are fundamental systems with magnetic ordering and promising candidate materials in the emerging field of antiferromagnetic spintronics. However, the magnetic proximity effect between antiferromagnetic bilayers is rarely studied because detecting the spin orientation of AFMs is challenging. Using X-ray linear dichroism and magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements, we investigated antiferromagnetic proximity effects in epitaxial CoO/NiO/MgO(001) systems. We found the antiferromagnetic spin of the NiO underwent a spin reorientation transition from in-plane to out-of-plane with increasing NiO thickness, with the existence of vertical exchange spring spin alignment in thick NiO. More interestingly, the N{\'{e}}el temperature of the CoO layer was greatly enhanced by the adjacent NiO layer, with the extent of the enhancement closely dependent on the spin orientation of NiO layer. This phenomenon was attributed to different exchange coupling strengths at the AFM/AFM interface depending on the relative spin directions. Our results indicate a new route for modifying the spin configuration and ordering temperature of AFMs through the magnetic proximity effect near room temperature, which should further benefit the design of AFM spintronic devices.},

We found that the NiO AFM spins undergo a spin reorientation transition (SRT) from the in-plane orientation to the out-of-plane orientation at a critical NiO thickness. The NiO AFM SRT can be attributed to the competition between the out-of-plane anisotropy of the NiO AFM spins and the AFM interfacial exchange coupling with the CoO in-plane spins. The NiO SRT thickness increases with the CoO thickness and also with the interfacial coupling strength. The temperature-dependent XMLD measurement indicates that the exchange coupling at the NiO/CoO interface can greatly enhance the N{\'{e}}el temperature of the CoO layer. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Physical Society.},

Here, we demonstrate the direct optical probe of ultrafast laser-induced AFM spin dynamics of thin AFM CoO films using time-resolved magnetic linear dichroism effect in reflection geometry. The ultrafast laser excitation of the CoO film leads to the quench of AFM order, manifested as large polarization rotations of the reflected probe light. Far below the N{\'{e}}el temperature (TN), the quench of the AFM order occurs within 300 fs, which is faster than the lattice thermalization (∼1ps) via electron-lattice scattering. This AFM quench process, however, slows down near TN, where an additional slower quench process with the time constant longer than 20 ps is emergent. Such an AFM spin dynamics is dramatically different than the transient reflectivity dynamics which is nearly invariant in a wide temperature range across TN. We attribute the quench of AFM order in CoO to the charge-transfer excitation and thermal effect, but the latter mechanism only plays a significant role near TN.},

It would not be for another 40 years that Roger, now at Oxford and motivated by the discovery of the high-{\$}T{\_}{\{}c{\}}{\$} cuprate superconductors [Bednorz {\&} Muller 1986 Z. Phys. B {\$}\backslashmathbf{\{}64{\}}{\$} 189], would make another attempt at the parameterisation of the magnetic excitation spectrum that had previously alluded him. Upon his return to CoO, Roger found a system embroiled in controversy, with some of its most fundamental parameters still remaining undetermined. Faced with such a formidable task, Roger performed a series of inelastic neutron scattering experiments in the early 2010's on both CoO and a magnetically dilute structural analogue MgO. These experiments would prove instrumental in the determination of both single-ion [Cowley {\$}\backslashtextit{\{}et al.{\}}{\$} 2013 Phys. Rev.

Both these sets of parameters would eventually be used in a spin-orbit exciton model [Sarte {\$}\backslashtextit{\{}et al.{\}}{\$} 2019 Phys. Rev. B {\$}\backslashmathbf{\{}100{\}}{\$} 075143], developed by his longtime friend and collaborator Bill Buyers, to successfully parameterise the complex spectrum that both measured at Chalk River almost 50 years prior. The story of CoO is of one that has come full circle, one filled with both spectacular failures and intermittent, yet profound, little victories.},

Antiferromagnetic twin domains were observed in (001) CoO films at 77°K by transmitted polarized light. The tetragonal distortion in CoO was measured down to 83°K and had bulk values with a c/a ratio of 0.9880 at 83°K. Magnetic torque measurements were made from 77° to 296°K in fields up to 22 kOe. The symmetry and amplitude of the torque varied when the sample was cooled from room temperature in a field. Cooling in a field altered the spin axes distribution to favor those spin axes most perpendicular to the cooling field direction. The torque data for the (111) orientation were consistent with a single- and a multi-spin-axis model. However, the torque data for the (001) orientation were consistent only with a single-spin-axis model. {\textcopyright} 1966 The American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {The x-ray photoemission spectrum of the valence states of 3d transition-metal systems is spin polarized when using circularly polarized photons. The integral of the spin-orbit spectrum is proportional to the expectation value of the angular part of the 3d spin-orbit operator in the initial state. We show that this quantity can be used to get an estimate of the atomic orbital moment. While the measurement is sensitive to the magnetization axis, it does not require a net macroscopic magnetization nor the presence of a long-range magnetic order, and is therefore suitable for any transition-metal systems being antiferromagnetic or paramagnetic or magnetically disordered. In the case of full 3d shell the integral of the spin-orbit spectrum is zero, but the spectral shape can give a direct estimate of the 3d spin-orbit energy splitting $\Delta$ESO. We have used Cu and CoO to experimentally test this technique. As expected Cu provides a vanishing result for (Lz), whereas for Co2+ in CoO we find (Lz) = 1.36ℏ at 0 K. On the other hand we find $\Delta$ESO≃280 meV for Cu.},

The magneto-optical birefringence effect is found to strongly depend on the photon energy of incident light, and a surprising large polarization rotation angle up to 168.5 mdeg is obtained from a 4.6 nm CoO film with a blue light source, making it possible to further investigate the evolution of AFM domains in AFM ultrathin film under external field.},

In their crystalline field of cubic symmetry the orbital degeneracies of Fe++ and Co++ are not completely removed and the residual orbital angular momenta play an important role through the presence of the spin-orbit coupling and through the direct effect of the orbital magnetic moments. After deriving the effective Hamiltonian for these degenerate cases, which corresponds to the Hamiltonian derived by Pryce for the non-degenerate case, we discuss the paramagnetic susceptibility, the N{\'{e}}el temperature and the state of each ion at absolute zero. We can give a reasonable quantitative interpretation of the susceptibility of CoO in paramagnetic state and obtain a good agreement with experiment for the magnetic moment of CoO in antiferromagnetic state. For FeO, sufficiently reliable data to compare with theory are not available at present, but a preliminary comparison is made. Further, in connection with the investigation of the validity of our theory, the origins of the crystalline field are discussed and it is pointed out that the covalent effect may make an appreciable contribution to the crystalline field.},

In this work, we demonstrate that in antiferromagnetic NiO/Pt bilayers circular domain structures can be generated by switching driven by electrical current pulses. The generated domains are T-domains, separated from each other by a domain wall whose spins are pointing toward the average direction of the two T-domains rather than the common axis of the two planes. Interestingly, this direction is the same for the whole circular domain indicating the absence of strong Lifshitz invariants. The domain wall can be micromagnetically modeled by strain distributions in the NiO thin film induced by the MgO substrate, deviating from the bulk anisotropy.

Our results prove that the strong magneto-crystalline anisotropy of CoO antiferromagnetic spin plays a significant role in exchange-induced anisotropy. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Institute of Physics.},

The symmetry change observed at the N{\'{e}}el point is interpreted as a strong effect of spontaneous anisotropy magnetostriction. As a consequence the uniaxial direction of the modified symmetry must coincide with that of the magnetic axis. Assignments of antiferromagnetic arrangements for the compounds are reached.

   abstract = {Antiferromagnetic insulators are a ubiquitous class of magnetic materials, holding the promise of low-dissipation spin-based computing devices that can display ultra-fast switching and are robust against stray fields. However, their imperviousness to magnetic fields also makes them difficult to control in a reversible and scalable manner. Here we demonstrate a novel proof-of-principle ionic approach to control the spin reorientation (Morin) transition reversibly in the common antiferromagnetic insulator α-Fe 2 O 3 (haematite) – now an emerging spintronic material that hosts topological antiferromagnetic spin-textures and long magnon-diffusion lengths. We use a low-temperature catalytic-spillover process involving the post-growth incorporation or removal of hydrogen from α-Fe 2 O 3 thin films. Hydrogenation drives pronounced changes in its magnetic anisotropy, Néel vector orientation and canted magnetism via electron injection and local distortions. We explain these effects with a detailed magnetic anisotropy model and first-principles calculations. Tailoring our work for future applications, we demonstrate reversible control of the room-temperature spin-state by doping/expelling hydrogen in Rh-substituted α-Fe 2 O 3 .},

abstract = {In the quest for post-CMOS (complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor) technologies, driven by the need for improved efficiency and performance, topologically protected ferromagnetic ‘whirls' such as skyrmions1–8 and their anti-particles have shown great promise as solitonic information carriers in racetrack memory-in-logic or neuromorphic devices1,9–11. However, the presence of dipolar fields in ferromagnets, which restricts the formation of ultrasmall topological textures3,6,8,9,12, and the deleterious skyrmion Hall effect, when skyrmions are driven by spin torques9,10,12, have thus far inhibited their practical implementation. Antiferromagnetic analogues, which are predicted to demonstrate relativistic dynamics, fast deflection-free motion and size scaling, have recently become the subject of intense focus9,13–19, but they have yet to be experimentally demonstrated in natural antiferromagnetic systems. Here we realize a family of topological antiferromagnetic spin textures in $\alpha$-Fe2O3—an Earth-abundant oxide insulator—capped with a platinum overlayer. By exploiting a first-order analogue of the Kibble–Zurek mechanism20,21, we stabilize exotic merons and antimerons (half-skyrmions)8 and their pairs (bimerons)16,22, which can be erased by magnetic fields and regenerated by temperature cycling. These structures have characteristic sizes of the order of 100 nanometres and can be chemically controlled via precise tuning of the exchange and anisotropy, with pathways through which further scaling may be achieved. Driven by current-based spin torques from the heavy-metal overlayer, some of these antiferromagnetic textures could emerge as prime candidates for low-energy antiferromagnetic spintronics at room temperature1,9–11,23.},

The manipulation of antiferromagnetic spin-waves in thin films is anticipated to lead to new exotic phenomena such as spin-superfluidity, requiring an efficient propagation of spin-waves in thin films. However, the reported decay length in thin films has so far been limited to a few nanometers. In this work, we achieve efficient spin-wave propagation over micrometer distances in thin films of the insulating antiferromagnet hematite with large magnetic domains while evidencing much shorter attenuation lengths in multidomain thin films. Through transport and magnetic imaging, we determine the role of the magnetic domain structure and spin-wave scattering at domain walls to govern the transport. We manipulate the spin transport by tailoring the domain configuration through field cycle training. For the appropriate crystalline orientation, zero-field spin transport is achieved across micrometers, as required for device integration.},

abstract = {The dependence of the energy $\gamma$180 and the halfwidth $\delta$180 of 180° L‐domain walls in antiferromagnets on the magnetic field H is calculated for low fields. At H → H0 (H0 is the critical field of the spin‐flop transition) the walls expand and their energy $\gamma$180 decreases. In the spin‐flop region 90° domain structure appears. $\gamma$90 and $\delta$90 are determined by the value of fourth‐order anisotropy constant K2. The calculation of the metastable state (K2 {\textless}0) region shows that its boundaries may be approximated by the astroid at |K2| ≪ K1 only. The wall displacement in the spin‐flop region (K2 ≪ 0) and the domain structure at K2 {\textgreater} 0 are discussed. The problem of the new magnetic phase nucleation is considered.

Two of the trypsin-chymotrypsin inhibitors were adsorbed on the first four types of chromatographic media. All three inhibitors have a molecular mass of 16 kDa as judged by gel filtration and sodium dodecyl sul-fate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The trypsin inhibitory activity of the inhibitors was attenuated in the presence of the reducing agent dithiothreitol. The remaining inhibitor was unadsorbed on SP-Sepharose but adsorbed on Q-Sepharose, Mono Q and Mono S. The protease inhibitors did not exert any inhibitory effect on hepatoma (Hep G2) and breast cancer (MCF 7) cells or antifungal action toward Botrytis cinerea, Fusarium oxyspontm and Mycosphaerella arachidicola. Two of the inhibitors slightly inhibited the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, with an IC 50 in the millimolar range. {\textcopyright} 2009 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.},

abstract = {The problem of the observable equilibrium domain structure (DS) in pure antiferromagnets is investigated with the use of continuous elasticity theory. It is shown that the difference between the bulk and surface magnetoelastic strains causes imaginary 'incompatibility elastic charges' analogous to the surface 'magnetic' charges in ferromagnets. The corresponding long-range field is shown to contribute to the 'stray' energy of the sample that governs the appearance of the DS, the contribution from the 'elastic charges' being proportional to the sample volume. Competition between the elastic 'stray' field, which favours inhomogeneous strain distribution, and an external field, which tends to make the sample homogeneous, provides a reversible reconstruction of the DS under the action of the external magnetic field.},

Antiparallel spin sublattices in antiferromagnets, producing zero dipolar fields, lead to insensitivity to magnetic field perturbations, multi-level stability, ultrafast spin dynamics and other favourable characteristics, and may find utility in fields ranging from magnetic memories to optical signal processing. However, the absence of a net magnetic moment and ultrashort magnetization dynamics timescales make antiferromagnets notoriously difficult to study using common magnetometers or magnetic resonance techniques. Here, we demonstrate the experimental determination of the N{\'{e}}el vector in a thin film of antiferromagnetic CuMnAs (refs 9,10), a prominent material used in the first realization of antiferromagnetic memory chips.

abstract = {The origin of equilibrium domain structure in the bulk antiferromagnets with strong magnetoelastic coupling is analyzed. The developed model is based on the assumption that the description of macroscopic elastic stresses and strains that ac company the thermoelastic phase transition can be adequate only with the due account of microscopic tensor order parameter, namely, the microstress tensor. We assume that the microstress tensors arise locally at each crystallographic site along with the magnetic order parameter due to magnetoelastic coupling. Formally, these tensors are equivalent to the elastic dipoles and, like the magnetic dipoles in ferromagnets, produce long-range elastic fields whose contribution to the thermodynamic potential may be reduced by the formation of an equilibrium domain structure. In analogy with ferromagnets, the energy contribution which arises from the interaction between the elastic dipoles favors reduction of macroscopic deformation of the sample and may be called «destressing» energy. The due account of the «destressing» energy makes it possible to describe properly the formation of the domain structure in antiferromagnets and its dependence on the external field and the shape of the sample.},

@article{Li1956,
abstract = {At the N{\'{e}}el temperature local nucleations of the antiferromagnetic order and their subsequent growth lead to the formation of domain walls. The domains in an antiferromagnet are thermodynamically stable only when the anisotropy force opposing the gradual switch of spins in the Bloch zone is small such that the wall energy is offset by the gain in entropy. However, in most cases the domain wall would owe its stability to the presence of lattice imperfections, such as interstitial atoms or dislocations. A typical magnetization curve of an antiferromagnet with ferromagnetic domain walls is dipicted. The weak ferromagnetism observed in the (111) plane of -Fe2O3 (hematite) is identified with the magnetization in domain walls pinned down by lattice imperfections. An assumption that the linear dimension of domains is, on the average, 104 atomic spaces gives the observed strength of the weak ferromagnetism. The disappearance of this ferromagnetism at ca -20°C when the magnetic axis switches from [112] direction to the [111] direction is due to the extreme difference in the anisotropy force in the (111) plane and that in a plane containing the [111] axis. The following experimental findings on -Fe2O3 are interpreted: (a) The variation of the ferromagnetism as the temperature increases shows the general feature of the decrease of long-range order in cooperative phenomena, being very gradual at lower temperatures and growing sharper and sharper as the temperature approaches the N{\'{e}}el point. (b) In the transition region of the two antiferromagnetic states of -Fe2O3 an applied field in the (111) plane causes a decrease of the temperature at which the ferromagnetic effect and the large magnetostriction effect disappear but produces no change in the neutron diffraction intensity of the (111) line. {\textcopyright} 1956 The American Physical Society.},

Optical and X-ray topographic techniques have been used to study the distribution of imperfections and antiferromagnetic domains in these crystals. The appearance of plastic deformation at the growth surface in crystals grown at high temperatures is a result of the combined stresses induced by differential thermal contraction of overgrowth and substrate, and the presence of growth striations throughout the bulk of the crystals. The complexity of the antiferromagnetic domain structure, which is sensitive to crystal thickness, is a direct result of the inhibiting effect of the substrate and the misfit associated with the antiferromagnetic tetragonal distortion.

The electric field of free-space terahertz pulses has provided a direct gateway to manipulating the motion of charges on the femtosecond timescale. Here, we complement this process by showing that the magnetic component of intense terahertz transients enables ultrafast control of the spin degree of freedom. Single-cycle terahertz pulses switch on and off coherent spin waves in antiferromagnetic NiO at frequencies as high as 1 THz. An optical probe pulse with a duration of 8 fs follows the terahertz-induced magnetic dynamics directly in the time domain and verifies that the terahertz field addresses spins selectively by means of the Zeeman interaction. This concept provides a universal ultrafast means to control previously inaccessible magnetic excitations in the electronic ground state. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Antiferromagnetic materials are internally magnetic, but the direction of their ordered microscopic moments alternates between individual atomic sites. The resulting zero net magnetic moment makes magnetism in antiferromagnets externally invisible. This implies that information stored in antiferromagnetic moments would be invisible to common magnetic probes, insensitive to disturbing magnetic fields, and the antiferromagnetic element would not magnetically affect its neighbours, regardless of how densely the elements are arranged in the device. The intrinsic high frequencies of antiferromagnetic dynamics represent another property that makes antiferromagnets distinct from ferromagnets. Among the outstanding questions is how to manipulate and detect the magnetic state of an antiferromagnet efficiently. In this Review we focus on recent works that have addressed this question. The field of antiferromagnetic spintronics can also be viewed from the general perspectives of spin transport, magnetic textures and dynamics, and materials research.

Here, we show the optical generation of ultrafast spin current in an AFM/HM heterostructure at zero external magnetic field and at room temperature by detecting the associated terahertz emission.

@article{Hoogeboom2017,
abstract = {We report on spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) measurements of Pt Hall bars on antiferromagnetic NiO(111) single crystals. An SMR with a sign opposite to conventional SMR is observed over a wide range of temperatures as well as magnetic fields stronger than 0.25 T. The negative sign of the SMR can be explained by the alignment of magnetic moments being almost perpendicular to the external magnetic field within the easy plane (111) of the antiferromagnet. This correlation of magnetic moment alignment and the external magnetic field direction is realized just by the easy-plane nature of the material without the need of any exchange coupling to an additional ferromagnet. The SMR signal strength decreases with increasing temperature, primarily due to the decrease in N{\'{e}}el order by including fluctuations. An increasing magnetic field increases the SMR signal strength as there are fewer domains, and the magnetic moments are more strongly manipulated at high magnetic fields. The SMR is saturated at an applied magnetic field of 6 T, resulting in a spin-mixing conductance of ∼1018 $\Omega$-1m-2, which is comparable to that of Pt on insulating ferrimagnets such as yttrium iron garnet. An argon plasma treatment doubles the spin-mixing conductance.},

abstract = {In spin transport experiments with spin currents propagating through antiferromagnetic (AFM) material, the antiferromagnet is treated as a mainly passive spin conductor not generating nor adding any spin current to the system. The spin current transmissivity of the AFM NiO is affected by magnetic fluctuations, peaking at the N$\backslash$'eel temperature and decreasing by lowering the temperature.

The spin currents are injected either electrically or by thermal gradients and measured at a wide range of temperatures and magnetic field strengths.

The thermally generated signals, however, show an additional upturn below 100{\$}\backslash,{\$}K which are unaffected by an increased NiO thickness. A change in the thermal conductivity could affect these signals. The temperature and magnetic field dependence is similar as for bulk NiO, indicating that NiO itself contributes to thermally induced spin currents.},

@article{Qiu2018,
abstract = {Colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) refers to a large change in electrical conductivity induced by a magnetic field in the vicinity of a metal-insulator transition and has inspired extensive studies for decades 1,2 . Here we demonstrate an analogous spin effect near the N{\'{e}}el temperature, T N = 296 K, of the antiferromagnetic insulator Cr2O3. Using a yttrium iron garnet YIG/Cr2O3/Pt trilayer, we injected a spin current from the YIG into the Cr2O3 layer and collected, via the inverse spin Hall effect, the spin signal transmitted into the heavy metal Pt. We observed a two orders of magnitude difference in the transmitted spin current within 14 K of the N{\'{e}}el temperature. This transition between spin conducting and non-conducting states was also modulated by a magnetic field in isothermal conditions. This effect, which we term spin colossal magnetoresistance (SCMR), has the potential to simplify the design of fundamental spintronics components, for instance, by enabling the realization of spin-current switches or spin-current-based memories.},

@article{Hou2017,
abstract = {Spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) has been investigated in Pt/NiO/YIG structures in a wide range of temperature and NiO thickness. The SMR shows a negative sign below a temperature that increases with the NiO thickness. This is contrary to a conventional SMR theory picture applied to the Pt/YIG bilayer, which always predicts a positive SMR. The negative SMR is found to persist even when NiO blocks the spin transmission between Pt and YIG, indicating it is governed by the spin current response of the NiO layer. We explain the negative SMR by the NiO "spin flop" coupled with YIG, which can be overridden at higher temperature by positive SMR contribution from YIG. This highlights the role of magnetic structure in antiferromagnets for transport of pure spin current in multilayers.},

Here, we report long-distance spin-transport in the antiferromagnetic orthoferrite YFeO 3 , where a different transport mechanism is enabled by the combined presence of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and externally applied fields. The magnon decay length is shown to exceed hundreds of nanometers, in line with resonance measurements that highlight the low magnetic damping. We observe a strong anisotropy in the magnon decay lengths that we can attribute to the role of the magnon group velocity in the transport of spin-waves in antiferromagnets. This unique mode of transport identified in YFeO 3 opens up the possibility of a large and technologically relevant class of materials, i.e., canted antiferromagnets, for long-distance spin transport.},

    "abstract": "Recently the field of Human-Robot Interaction gained popularity, due to the\nwide range of possibilities of how robots can support humans during daily\ntasks. One form of supportive robots are socially assistive robots which are\nspecifically built for communicating with humans, e.g., as service robots or\npersonal companions. As they understand humans through artificial intelligence,\nthese robots will at some point make wrong assumptions about the humans'\ncurrent state and give an unexpected response. In human-human conversations,\nunexpected responses happen frequently. However, it is currently unclear how\nsuch robots should act if they understand that the human did not expect their\nresponse, or even showing the uncertainty of their response in the first place.\nFor this, we explore the different forms of potential uncertainties during\nhuman-robot conversations and how humanoids can, through verbal and non-verbal\ncues, communicate these uncertainties.",

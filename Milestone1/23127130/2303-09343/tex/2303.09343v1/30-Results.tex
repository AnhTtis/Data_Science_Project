Our method is implemented in Python.
To be more specific, we use PyTorch to handle the network and evaluate $J$ on
the GPU, while the optimization solver is a limited memory BFGS algorithm 
\cite{byrd1995} available in the Scipy package.
Our numerical tests run on a Titan RTX GPU and AMD Ryzen 9 3950x CPU, with 32 GiB of RAM.

We presented a physics-based solution for a partial surface-matching problem that works with non-linear material using deep learning and optimal control formalism. The results are obtained on two main scenarios that differ both in scale and complexity. We showed that a fast and accurate registration can be obtained in both cases and can, in addition, predict the set of external forces that led to the deformation. Such results show that deep learning and optimal control have a lot in common and can be easily coupled to solve optimization problems very efficiently. Current limitations of our work are mostly due to the limited accuracy of the network and the need to retrain the network when the shape or material parameters of the model change.

    "abstract": "The well-known Erdős-Hajnal conjecture states that for any graph $F$, there exists $ε>0$ such that every $n$-vertex graph $G$ that contains no induced copy of $F$ has a homogeneous set of size at least $n^ε$. We consider a variant of the Erdős-Hajnal problem for hypergraphs where we forbid a family of hypergraphs described by their orders and sizes. For graphs, we observe that if we forbid induced subgraphs on $m$ vertices and $f$ edges for any positive $m$ and $0\\leq f \\leq \\binom{m}{2}$, then we obtain large homogeneous sets. For triple systems, in the first nontrivial case $m=4$, for every $S \\subseteq \\{0,1,2,3,4\\}$, we give bounds on the minimum size of a homogeneous set in a triple system where the number of edges spanned by every four vertices is not in $S$. For all $S$ we determine if the growth rate is polylogarithmic. Several open problems remain.",

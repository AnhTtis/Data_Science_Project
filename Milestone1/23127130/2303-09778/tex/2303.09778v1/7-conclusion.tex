\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclu}

To cope with edge perturbations in graphs with heterophily, this paper proposes a novel graph structure learning framework ~\framework{} that considers the structural entropy theory in graph structure optimization.  
We design a structure enhancement module guided by the one-dimensional structural entropy maximization strategy to extend the information embedded in the topology. To capture the hierarchical semantics of graphs, high-dimensional structural entropy minimization is performed for optimal encoding trees. We propose a node sampling technique on the encoding tree to restore the most appropriate edge connections at different community levels, taking into account the deduction structural entropy distribution. In the future, we plan to combine delicate loss functions with structural entropy so that the knowledge in encoding trees can be converted into gradient information, which will further allow for end-to-end structure optimization.

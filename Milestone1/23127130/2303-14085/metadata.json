    "abstract": "In this paper we introduce a variant of optimal transport adapted to the causal structure given by an underlying directed graph. Different graph structures lead to different specifications of the optimal transport problem. For instance, a fully connected graph yields standard optimal transport, a linear graph structure corresponds to adapted optimal transport, and an empty graph leads to a notion of optimal transport related to CO-OT, Gromov-Wasserstein distances and factored OT. We derive different characterizations of causal transport plans and introduce Wasserstein distances between causal models that respect the underlying graph structure. We show that average treatment effects are continuous with respect to causal Wasserstein distances and small perturbations of structural causal models lead to small deviations in causal Wasserstein distance. We also introduce an interpolation between causal models based on causal Wasserstein distance and compare it to standard Wasserstein interpolation.",

    "abstract": "The MadMax theory is a recently discovered theory of non-linear electrodynamics that admits many important gravitating solutions within the Einstein theory. Namely, it was originally derived as the unique non-linear electrodynamics (that depends only on the field invariant $F_{μν}F^{μν}$) whose radiative solutions can be found in the Robinson-Trautman class. At the same time, it is the only electrodynamics of this type (apart from Maxwell) whose slowly rotating solutions are fully characterized by the electrostatic potential. In this paper, after discussing the basic properties of the MadMax theory, we concentrate on its spherical electric solutions. These not only provide \"the simplest\" regularization of point electric field and its self-energy, but also feature complex thermodynamic behavior (in both canonical and grandcanonical ensembles) and admit an unprecedented phase diagram with multiple first-order, second-order, and zeroth-order phase transitions. Among other notable solutions, we construct a novel C-metric describing accelerated AdS black holes in the MadMax theory. We also present a generalization of the MadMax Lagrangian applicable to magnetic solutions, and find the corresponding spherical, slowly rotating, and weakly NUT charged solutions.",

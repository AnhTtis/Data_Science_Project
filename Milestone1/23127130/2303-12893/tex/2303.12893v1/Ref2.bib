    abstract = { Understanding Dirac-like fermions has become an imperative in modern condensed matter sciences: All across the research frontier, from graphene to high Tc superconductors to the topological insulators and beyond, various electronic systems exhibit properties that can be well described by the Dirac equation. Such physics is no longer the exclusive domain of quantum field theories and other esoteric mathematical musings; instead, physics of real condensed matter systems is governed by such equations, and important materials science and practical implications hinge on our understanding of Dirac particles in two and three dimensions. Although the physics that gives rise to the massless Dirac fermions in each of the above-mentioned materials is different, the low-energy properties are governed by the same Dirac kinematics. The aim of this article is to review a selected cross-section of this vast field by highlighting the generalities and contrasting the specifics of several physical systems. }

Indeed, many of the first successes of the quantum theory of solids, such as understanding the large specific heat of metals, followed from applications of the Fermi surface concept. Great effort has been devoted in recent years to semimetals in which the Fermi surface shrinks to a set of Dirac or Weyl points, where four or two bands cross respectively. 3D crystals with both kinds of band structure have been found in recent years, which completes a search that began in the 1930s with the work of Conyers Herring.}",

abstract = {Among different topological and related phases of condensed matter, nodal semimetals occupy a special placeÑthe electronic band topology in these materials is related to 3D bulk, rather than to surface, states. A great variety of different realizations of electronic band crossings (the nodes) leads to a plethora of different electronic properties, ranging from chiral anomaly to solid-state realizations of a black-hole horizon. The different nodal phases have similar low-energy band structure and quasiparticle dynamics, which both can be accessed experimentally by a number of methods. Optical measurements with their large penetration depth and high energy resolution are ideally suited as such a bulk probe, especially at low energies where other spectroscopic methods often lack the required resolution. Herein, recent optical conductivity studies of different nodal semimetals are reviewed, possible limitations of such measurements are discussed, and a comparison between the experimental results, simple theoretical models, and band-structure-based calculations is provided.},

abstract = {Metals are canonical plasmonic media at infrared and optical wavelengths, allowing one to guide and manipulate light at the nanoscale. A special form of optical waveguiding is afforded by highly anisotropic crystals revealing the opposite signs of the dielectric functions along orthogonal directions. These media are classified as hyperbolic and include crystalline insulators, semiconductors, and artificial metamaterials. Layered anisotropic metals are also anticipated to support hyperbolic waveguiding. However, this behavior remains elusive, primarily because interband losses arrest the propagation of infrared modes. Here, we report on the observation of propagating hyperbolic waves in a prototypical layered nodal-line semimetal ZrSiSe. The observed waveguiding originates from polaritonic hybridization between near-infrared light and nodal-line plasmons. Unique nodal electronic structures simultaneously suppress interband loss and boost the plasmonic response, ultimately enabling the propagation of infrared modes through the bulk of the crystal. Nodal-line metals allow hyperbolic infrared waveguiding through the bulk with band structureÐengineered loss reduction.}}

abstract = {We visualized negative refraction of phonon polaritons, which occurs at the interface between two natural crystals. The polaritonsÑhybrids of infrared photons and lattice vibrationsÑform collimated rays that display negative refraction when passing through a planar interface between the two hyperbolic van der Waals materials: molybdenum oxide (MoO3) and isotopically pure hexagonal boron nitride (h11BN). At a special frequency ?0, these rays can circulate along closed diamond-shaped trajectories. We have shown that polariton eigenmodes display regions of both positive and negative dispersion interrupted by multiple gaps that result from polaritonic-level repulsion and strong coupling. Refraction is a familiar effect in which a light beam alters direction as it propagates from one medium to another. Negative refraction is a nonintuitive but well-established effect in which the light beam is bent in the ÒwrongÓ direction. Two groups now independently demonstrate negative refraction at the interface of two-dimensional van der Waal materials. Hu et al. used molybdenum trioxide with a graphene overlayer to show that in-plane negative refraction of mid-infrared (mid-IR) polaritons occurs at the interface and is gate tunable. Sternbach et al. used molybdenum trioxide/hexagonal boron nitride bicrystals to show that negative refraction of mid-IR polaritons occurs for propagation normal to the interface. Polaritonic negative refraction in the mid-IR provides opportunities for optical and thermal applications such as IR super-resolution imaging, nanoscale thermal manipulation, and chemical sensing devices with enhanced sensitivity. ÑISO Nanoscale negative refraction is demonstrated for polaritons propagating normal to the interface of 2D bicrystals.}}

    abstract = { Weyl metal is the first example of a conducting material with a nontrivial electronic structure topology, making it distinct from an ordinary metal. Unlike in insulators, the nontrivial topology is not related to invariants associated with completely filled bands but with ones associated with the Fermi surface. The Fermi surface of a topological metal consists of disconnected sheets, each enclosing a Weyl node, which is a point of contact between two nondegenerate bands. Such a point contact acts as a source of Berry curvature or a magnetic monopole in momentum space. Its charge, or the flux of the Berry curvature through the enclosing Fermi surface sheet, is a topological invariant. We review the current state of this rapidly growing field with a focus on bulk transport phenomena in topological metals. }

This unusual electronic structure has deep analogies with particle physics and leads to unique topological properties. We report the experimental discovery of a Weyl semimetal, tantalum arsenide (TaAs). Using photoemission spectroscopy, we directly observe Fermi arcs on the surface, as well as the Weyl fermion cones and Weyl nodes in the bulk of TaAs single crystals. We find that Fermi arcs terminate on the Weyl fermion nodes, consistent with their topological character.

	abstract = {Theoretical predictions and subsequent experimental observations of high-temperature superconductivity in dense hydrogen-rich compounds have reinvigorated the field of superconductivity. A systematic computational study of the hydrides of lanthanum and yttrium over a wide composition range reveals hydrogen-rich structures with intriguing electronic properties under pressure. Electron{\textendash}phonon coupling calculations predict the existence of new superconducting phases, some exhibiting superconductivity in the range of room temperature. Moreover, the calculated stabilities indicate the materials could be synthesized at pressures that are currently accessible in the laboratory. The results open the prospect for the design, synthesis, and recovery of new high-temperature superconductors with potential practical applications.A systematic structure search in the La{\textendash}H and Y{\textendash}H systems under pressure reveals some hydrogen-rich structures with intriguing electronic properties. For example, LaH10 is found to adopt a sodalite-like face-centered cubic (fcc) structure, stable above 200 GPa, and LaH8 a C2/m space group structure. Phonon calculations indicate both are dynamically stable; electron phonon calculations coupled to Bardeen{\textendash}Cooper{\textendash}Schrieffer (BCS) arguments indicate they might be high-Tc superconductors. In particular, the superconducting transition temperature Tc calculated for LaH10 is 274{\textendash}286 K at 210 GPa. Similar calculations for the Y{\textendash}H system predict stability of the sodalite-like fcc YH10 and a Tc above room temperature, reaching 305{\textendash}326 K at 250 GPa. The study suggests that dense hydrides consisting of these and related hydrogen polyhedral networks may represent new classes of potential very high-temperature superconductors.},

For broken time reversal symmetry (TR) they are displaced in momentum space by  and the anomalous DC Hall conductivity  is proportional to  at charge neutrality. For finite doping there are additive corrections to  which depend on the chemical potential as well as on the tilt () of the Dirac cones and on their relative orientation. If inversion symmetry (I) is also broken the Weyl nodes are shifted in energy by an amount . This introduces further changes in  and we provide simple analytic formulas for these modifications for both type I () and type II (, overtilted) Weyl. For type I when the Weyl nodes have equal magnitude but oppositely directed tilts, the correction to  is proportional to the chemical potential ÎŒ and completely independent of the energy shift . When instead the tilts are parallel, the correction is linear in  and ÎŒ drops out. For type II the corrections involve both ÎŒ and , are nonlinear and also involve a momentum cut off.

abstract = {Introduction
Spin gapless semiconductors (SGSs) and nodal ring states (NRSs) have aroused great scientific interest in recent years due to their unique electronic properties and high application potential in the field of spintronics and magnetoelectronics.
Objectives
Since their advent, all SGSs and NRSs have been predicted in independent materials. In this work, we proposed a novel type of material, nodal ring spin gapless semiconductor (NRSGS), which combines both states of the SGSs and NRSs.
Methods
The synthesized material Mg2VO4 has been detailed with band structure analysis based on first principle calculations.
Results
Obtained results revealed that there are gapless crossings in the spin-up direction, which are from multiple topological nodal rings located exactly at the Fermi energy level. Mg2VO4 combines the advantages inherited from both NRSs and SGSs in terms of the innumerable gapless points along multiple nodal rings with all linear dispersions and direct contacts. In addition, Mg2VO4 also shows strong robustness against both the spin orbit coupling effect and strain conditions.
Conclusion
For the first time, we propose the concept of an NRSGS, and the first such material candidate Mg2VO4 can immediately advance corresponding experimental measurements and even facilitate real applications.}

@article{Bian2016,
	abstract = {Topological semimetals can support one-dimensional Fermi lines or zero-dimensional Weyl points in momentum space, where the valence and conduction bands touch. While the degeneracy points in Weyl semimetals are robust against any perturbation that preserves translational symmetry, nodal lines require protection by additional crystalline symmetries such as mirror reflection. Here we report, based on a systematic theoretical study and a detailed experimental characterization, the existence of topological nodal-line states in the non-centrosymmetric compound PbTaSe2 with strong spin-orbit coupling. Remarkably, the spin-orbit nodal lines in PbTaSe2 are not only protected by the reflection symmetry but also characterized by an integer topological invariant. Our detailed angle-resolved photoemission measurements, first-principles simulations and theoretical topological analysis illustrate the physical mechanism underlying the formation of the topological nodal-line states and associated surface states for the first time, thus paving the way towards exploring the exotic properties of the topological nodal-line fermions in condensed matter systems.},

	abstract = {Materials harbouring exotic quasiparticles, such as massless Dirac and Weyl fermions, have garnered much attention from physics and material science communities due to their exceptional physical properties such as ultra-high mobility and extremely large magnetoresistances. Here, we show that the highly stable, non-toxic and earth-abundant material, ZrSiS, has an electronic band structure that hosts several Dirac cones that form a Fermi surface with a diamond-shaped line of Dirac nodes. We also show that the square Si lattice in ZrSiS is an excellent template for realizing new types of two-dimensional Dirac cones recently predicted by Young and Kane. Finally, we find that the energy range of the linearly dispersed bands is as high as 2 eV above and below the Fermi level; much larger than of other known Dirac materials. This makes ZrSiS a very promising candidate to study Dirac electrons, as well as the properties of lines of Dirac nodes.},

abstract = {Photoemission demonstrates that the Dirac-like band crossings form 1D nodal lines and 2D nodal surfaces in the bulk of ZrSiS. Topological semimetals are characterized by symmetry-protected band crossings, which can be preserved in different dimensions in momentum space, forming zero-dimensional nodal points, one-dimensional nodal lines, or even two-dimensional nodal surfaces. Materials harboring nodal points and nodal lines have been experimentally verified, whereas experimental evidence of nodal surfaces is still lacking. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we reveal the coexistence of Dirac nodal surfaces and nodal lines in the bulk electronic structures of ZrSiS. As compared with previous ARPES studies on ZrSiS, we obtained pure bulk states, which enable us to extract unambiguously intrinsic information of the bulk nodal surfaces and nodal lines. Our results show that the nodal lines are the only feature near the Fermi level and constitute the whole Fermi surfaces. We not only prove that the low-energy quasiparticles in ZrSiS are contributed entirely by Dirac fermions but also experimentally realize the nodal surface in topological semimetals.}}

abstract = {We review the recent, mainly theoretical, progress in the study of topological nodal line semimetals in three dimensions. In these semimetals, the conduction and the valence bands cross each other along a one-dimensional curve in the three-dimensional Brillouin zone, and any perturbation that preserves a certain symmetry group (generated by either spatial symmetries or time-reversal symmetry) cannot remove this crossing line and open a full direct gap between the two bands. The nodal line(s) is hence topologically protected by the symmetry group, and can be associated with a topological invariant. In this review, (i) we enumerate the symmetry groups that may protect a topological nodal line; (ii) we write down the explicit form of the topological invariant for each of these symmetry groups in terms of the wave functions on the Fermi surface, establishing a topological classification; (iii) for certain classes, we review the proposals for the realization of these semimetals in real materials; (iv) we discuss different scenarios that when the protecting symmetry is broken, how a topological nodal line semimetal becomes Weyl semimetals, Dirac semimetals, and other topological phases; and (v) we discuss the possible physical effects accessible to experimental probes in these materials.}

abstract = {Weyl fermionsâmassless particles with half-integer spinâwere once mistakenly thought to describe neutrinos. Although not yet observed among elementary particles, Weyl fermions may exist as collective excitations in so-called Weyl semimetals. These materials have an unusual band structure in which the linearly dispersing valence and conduction bands meet at discrete âWeyl points.â Xu et al. used photoemission spectroscopy to identify TaAs as a Weyl semimetal capable of hosting Weyl fermions. In a complementary study, Lu et al. detected the characteristic Weyl points in a photonic crystal. The observation of Weyl physics may enable the discovery of exotic fundamental phenomena. Science, this issue p. 613 and 622 Angle-resolved photoemission is used to detect the topological surface states and bulk dispersion of the compound tantalum arsenide. [Also see Report by Lu et al.] A Weyl semimetal is a new state of matter that hosts Weyl fermions as emergent quasiparticles and admits a topological classification that protects Fermi arc surface states on the boundary of a bulk sample. This unusual electronic structure has deep analogies with particle physics and leads to unique topological properties. We report the experimental discovery of a Weyl semimetal, tantalum arsenide (TaAs). Using photoemission spectroscopy, we directly observe Fermi arcs on the surface, as well as the Weyl fermion cones and Weyl nodes in the bulk of TaAs single crystals. We find that Fermi arcs terminate on the Weyl fermion nodes, consistent with their topological character. Our work opens the field for the experimental study of Weyl fermions in physics and materials science.}}

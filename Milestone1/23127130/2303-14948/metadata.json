    "abstract": "Quantum tunneling reactions play a significant role in chemistry when classical pathways are energetically forbidden, be it in gas phase reactions, surface diffusion, or liquid phase chemistry. In general, such tunneling reactions are challenging to calculate theoretically, given the high dimensionality of the quantum dynamics, and also very difficult to identify experimentally. Hydrogenic systems, however, allow for accurate first-principles calculations. In this way the rate of the gas phase proton transfer tunneling reaction of hydrogen molecules with deuterium anions, H_2 + D^- --> H^- + HD, has been calculated, but has so far lacked experimental verification. Here we present high-sensitivity measurements of the reaction rate carried out in a cryogenic 22-pole ion trap. We observe an extremely low rate constant of (5.2 +- 1.6) x 10^(-20) cm^3/s. This measured value agrees with quantum tunneling calculations, serving as a benchmark for molecular theory and advancing the understanding of fundamental collision processes. A deviation of the reaction rate from linear scaling, which is observed at high H_2 densities, can be traced back to previously unobserved heating dynamics in radiofrequency ion traps.",

We propose HIDEP, an approach that learns the dynamic embedding of patients from the longitudinal medical record of patients.
The novelty in HIDEP is that patient embedding captures spatial information from patient room transfer records as well as the interaction with the doctors.
Our experimental results show that HIDEP performs particularly well on CDI classification task where both exposure and individual susceptibility plays a role in CDI transmission, which confirms that HIDEP were able to capture this information in the patient embedding.

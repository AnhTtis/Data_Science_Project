\subsection{Evaluating the Embeddings}
Results described earlier in the paper show that embeddings obtained via \ourmethod are excellent for a variety of predictive tasks. 
In this subsection, we present findings from a qualitative exploration of the embeddings. 
This was done in collaboration with a medical doctor at the hospital who specializes in infectious diseases.

We start our exploration by computing \textit{dispersions} for subsets of healthcare entities.
% Specifically, 
Suppose that the set of doctors $\doc$ is partitioned into subsets $\doc_1, \doc_2, \ldots, \doc_d$.
For any $1 \le i < j \le d$ and time $t$ we define the pairwise \textit{doctor dispersion} between $\doc_i$ and $\doc_j$ as
\begin{align}
\small
    disp_{\doc, t}(i, j) = \frac{\sum_{d \in \doc_i, d' \in \doc_j} ||\ed_{d,t} - \ed_{d',t}||_2}{|\doc_i|\cdot |\doc_j|}
\end{align}
% $$disp_{\doc, t}(i, j) = \frac{\sum_{d \in \doc_i, d' \in \doc_j} ||\ed_{d,t} - \ed_{d',t}||_2}{|\doc_i|\cdot |\doc_j|}.$$ 

Recall that $\ed_{d,t}$ denotes the embedding of a doctor $d$ at time $t$.
If the partition $\doc_1, \doc_2, \ldots, \doc_d$ represents a grouping of doctors by specialty (e.g., pediatrics, cardiology, anesthesia, neurology, etc.) then the pairwise
doctor dispersions provide a measure of the average distance between doctors from different specialties in the computed embeddings.

One of the findings from the pairwise dispersion also confirms what is generally known about hospital operations. 
For example, doctors in general internal medicine and anesthesia interact with a wide variety of patients, and thus doctors in these specialties are close to those in other specialties. On the other hand, patients of doctors in Family Practice and Otolaryngology (ears, nose, and throat) tend not to require referral to other specialties. 
As a result, doctors in these specialties are relatively far away from doctors in other specialties.
In Figure \ref{fig:DECEnt_doctor_2d}, we plot the doctor embeddings learned by DECEnt projecting them to 2-d using t-SNE \cite{van2008visualizing}.
% We see a clear separation of the doctors that provide care to infants or children with internal medicine physicians and other physicians. which confirms that \ourmethod successfully captures the dynamics in care.

% Similarly, we compute pairwise \textit{medication dispersions} (induced by a partition of medications into classes) and pairwise \textit{room dispersions} (induced by a partition of rooms into units) and provide evaluations on the trained embeddings in the Appendix.

    "abstract": "The paper studies the large-time behavior of solutions to the Robin problem for PDEs with critical nonlinearities. For the considered problems, nonexistence results are obtained, which complements the interesting recent results by Ikeda et al. [J. Differential Equations, 269 (2020), no. 1, 563-594], where critical cases were left open. Moreover, our results provide partially answers to some other open questions previously posed by Zhang [Proc. Roy. Soc. Edinburgh Sect. A, 131 (2001), no. 2, 451-475] and Jleli-Samet [Nonlinear Anal., 178 (2019), 348-365].\n  The proof of main results is based on methods of nonlinear capacity estimates specifically adapted to the nature of the exterior domain. Furthermore, the difference in our approach lies in the fact that we are considering a class of test functions with logarithmic arguments.",

    \caption{\textbf{Quantitative Results for VGG11 across all convolutional layers}. We evaluate the localization scores each attribution method at the input and each convolutional layer of VGG11, on each of \gridpg, \difull, and \dipart. \emph{Top:} Backpropagation-based methods. \emph{Middle:} Activation-based methods. \emph{Bottom:} Perturbation-based methods. The two horizontal dotted lines mark localization scores of $1.0$ and $0.25$, which correspond to perfect and random localization, respectively. We find that the trends in performance corroborate with those seen across the selected input, middle, and final layers in our experiments.}

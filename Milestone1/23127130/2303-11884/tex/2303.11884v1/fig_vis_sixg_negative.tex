\caption{\textbf{Qualitative Visualization of smoothing \ixg attribution maps for various kernel sizes, including both positive and negative attributions.} \emph{Top}: Aggregate attribution maps for VGG19 on \pg at the top-left corner across the dataset. We see that positive attributions (green) aggregate to the top-left grid cell and negative attributions (red) aggregate outside when smoothing with large kernel sizes. \emph{Middle and Bottom}: Examples of smoothing on a single grid and non-grid image. 
Positive attributions concentrate inside the bounding box when smoothed with large kernels.

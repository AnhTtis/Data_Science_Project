\textbf{Left:} Illustration of \emph{\disc} and \emph{ML-Att}. In \disc, we evaluate models on image grids (col.~1). Crucially, we employ separate \emph{classification heads} for each subimage that cannot possibly be influenced by other subimages; this yields `ground truths' for possible and impossible attributions (col.~2). For ML-Att, we evaluate methods at different network layers; and show attributions for the example grid image using \gradcam and \intgrad. Further, we show results after smoothing \intgrad (\sintgrad), which we find to perform well (\cref{subsec:smoothing}). \gradcam, for instance, incorrectly attributes the bottom-right butterfly which lies in the `impossible' partition for attributions.
\textbf{Right:} Visualisation of our \aggatt evaluation. By sorting attributions into percentile ranges w.r.t.~their performance and aggregating them over many samples, we obtain a holistic view of a methods' performance. AggAtt can thus reflect both best and worst case behaviour of an attribution method.

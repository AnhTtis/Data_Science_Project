\caption{\textbf{Mean localization performance layer-wise across seven models of a selected subset of attribution methods.} For each method and network, we plot the mean localization score at at several depths. The x-axis shows the fraction of the total network depth (0 - input, 1 - final layer). As discussed in \cref{sec:method:intermediate} and \cref{fig:main}, the localization performance tends to improve towards the final layer.

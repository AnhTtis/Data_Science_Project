\caption{\textbf{Quantitative Results on VGG19 and Resnet152.} For each metric, we evaluate all attribution methods with respect to the input image (Inp), a middle (Mid), and the final (Fin) spatial layer. We observe the performance to improve from \emph{Inp} to \emph{Fin} on most settings. See also \cref{fig:scatter:selected}.
We find similar results on \difull and \dipart across methods.
The symbol * denotes boxes that collapse to a single value, for better readability.

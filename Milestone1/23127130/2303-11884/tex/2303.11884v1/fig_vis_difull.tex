\caption{\textbf{Qualitative Results for VGG19 on \disc evaluated at the top-left corner}. \textit{Centre:} Aggregate attributions sorted and binned in descending order of localization. Each column corresponds to a bin and each row corresponds to a method applied at its standard layer. \textit{Left:} Examples from the first bin, which corresponds to the best set of attributions. \textit{Right:} Examples from the last bin, which corresponds to the worst set of attributions. All examples shown correspond to images whose attributions lie at the median position in their bins.}

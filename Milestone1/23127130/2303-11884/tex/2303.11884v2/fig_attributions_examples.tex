\caption{\textbf{Left:} Example Attributions on the Standard, \pg, and \disc Settings. We show attributions for all methods on their typically evaluated layers, \ie input for backpropagation-based and perturbation-based, and final layer for activation-based methods. Blue boxes denote the object bounding box (Standard) or the grid cell (\pg, \disc) respectively. For \disc, we use images of the same class at the top-left and bottom-right corners as in our experiments. \textbf{Right:} \occ attributions for an example evaluated on \pg, \disc, and \cs. The top-left and bottom-right corners contain two different species of dogs, which share similar low-level features, causing both to be attributed in \pg. In contrast, our disconnected construction in \disc and \cs ensures that the bottom-right subimage does not influence the classification of the top-left, and thus should not be attributed by any attribution methods, even though some do erroneously.

    \caption{\textbf{Quantitative Results on CIFAR10 using VGG11}. We evaluate each attribution method at the input (Inp), middle (Mid), and final (Fin) convolutional layers, on each of \gridpg, \difull, and \dipart using $2\times2$ (left) and $3\times3$ (right) grids. \emph{Top:} Results on backpropagation-based methods. \emph{Middle:} Results on activation-based methods. \emph{Bottom:} Results on perturbation-based methods. The two horizontal dotted lines mark localization scores that correspond to perfect and random localization, respectively, which equal scores of $0.25$ and $0.11$ respectively for $2\times2$ and $3\times3$ grids. We use the ``*'' symbol to show boxes that collapse to a single point, for better readability.}

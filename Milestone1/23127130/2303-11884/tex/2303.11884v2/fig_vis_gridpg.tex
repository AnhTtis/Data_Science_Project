\caption{\textbf{Qualitative Results for VGG19 on \pg evaluated at the top-left corner}. \textit{Centre:} Aggregate attributions sorted and binned in descending order of localization. Each column corresponds to a bin, and set of three rows corresponds to a method. For each method, the three rows from top to bottom show the aggregate attributions at the input, middle, and final spatial layers. \textit{Left:} Examples from the first bin, which corresponds to the best set of attributions. \textit{Right:} Similarly, we show examples from the last bin, which corresponds to the worst set of attributions. For smooth \ixg, we use $K=129$ for the input layer, $K=17$ at the middle layer, and $K=9$ at the final layer. All examples shown correspond to images whose attributions lie at the median position in their respective bins.

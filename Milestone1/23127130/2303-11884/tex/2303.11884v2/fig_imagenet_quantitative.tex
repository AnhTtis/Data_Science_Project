    \caption{\textbf{Quantitative Results on ImageNet}. We evaluate the localization scores each attribution method at the input (Inp), middle (Mid), and final (Fin) convolutional layers, on each of \gridpg, \difull, and \dipart using seven models. \emph{Top:} Backpropagation-based methods. \emph{Middle:} Activation-based methods. \emph{Bottom:} Perturbation-based methods. The two horizontal dotted lines mark localization scores of $1.0$ and $0.25$, which correspond to perfect and random localization, respectively.}

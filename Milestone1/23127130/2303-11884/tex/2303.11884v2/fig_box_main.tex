\caption{\textbf{Quantitative Results on VGG19 and Resnet152.} For each metric, we evaluate all attribution methods with respect to the input image (Inp), a middle (Mid), and the final (Fin) spatial layer. Boxes of the same colour correspond to the same attribution method, and each group of three boxes shows, from left to right, the results at the input (Inp), middle (Mid), and final (Fin) spatial layers respectively. We observe the performance to improve from \emph{Inp} to \emph{Fin} on most settings. See also \cref{fig:scatter:selected}.
We find similar results on \difull and \dipart across methods.
The symbol * denotes boxes that collapse to a single value, for better readability.

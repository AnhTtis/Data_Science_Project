    "abstract": "Strain correlation functions in two-dimensional isotropic elastic bodies are shown both theoretically (using the general structure of isotropic tensor fields) and numerically (using a glass-forming model system) to depend on the coordinates of the field variable (position vector r in real space or wavevector q in reciprocal space) and thus on the direction of the field vector and the orientation of the coordinate system. Since the fluctuations of the longitudinal and transverse components of the strain field in reciprocal space are known in the long-wavelength limit from the equipartition theorem, all components of the correlation function tensor field are imposed and no additional physical assumptions are needed. An observed dependence on the field vector direction thus cannot be used as an indication for anisotropy or for a plastic rearrangement. This dependence is different for the associated strain response field containing also information on the localized stress perturbation.",

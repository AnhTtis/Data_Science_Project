    "abstract": "We investigate the possibility of detectable 2-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) type-II cross-sections at the High-Luminosity phase of the Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) for the production of the Standard Model (SM)-like Higgs boson ($h$) in association with a single top (anti)quark over the parameter space region corresponding to the so-called `wrong-sign solution' of the bottom (anti)quark Yukawa coupling. We isolate the latter by using the toolbox Magellan, which performs Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) scans in the presence of all current theoretical and experimental constraints, which relevance is accounted for accurately by using built-in Bayesian statistical methods. It is found that the allowed points in the 2HDM type-II parameter space of the aforementioned kind would not only provide inclusive rates considerably above those of the equivalent SM process but also distributions in several kinematical observables that are very different from the SM, both of which can help disentangle the SM from the 2HDM hypothesis. This difference is a consequence of the bottom-gluon fusion sub-process, which in the 2HDM becomes dominant over all others, with the latter remaining very close to the SM yields. We prove that this phenomenology would be observable at the HL-LHC for the illustrative example of $h$ to bottom-antibottom quark decays.",

\begin{abstract}
It was proven in  \cite{EsnShuSri}, that the \'etale fundamental group of a connected smooth projective variety over an algebraically closed field $k$ is topologically finitely presented. In this note, we extend this result to all connected proper schemes over $k$.

\section{Introduction}
For a connected algebraic variety $X$ over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic $0$, the \'etale fundamental group $\piet(X,\bx)$ of $X$ is a topologically finitely presented profinite group. This is proven by first reducing to the case of $k=\mathbb{C}$ and then applying the Riemann Existence Theorem \cite[Exp.~XII, Thm.~5.1]{SGA1} together with the fact that the topological fundamental group $\pi_1^{\rm top}(X(\mathbb{C}),x)$ is of finite presentation as a discrete group (see e.g.\ \cite{LojasiewiczTriangulations} or \cite{HironakaTriangulations}). 

In characteristic $p>0$, the picture is much more subtle due to the existence of Artin-Schreier covers of affine schemes, which makes $\piet(\Spec(A),\bx)$ typically not even topologically finitely generated. 
Remark~5.7 of \cite[Exp.~IX]{SGA1} raised doubts whether $\piet(X,\bx)$ is topologically finitely presented for proper varieties, even for proper smooth curves. 
In recent work, however, Shusterman (in the case of curves \cite{ShustermanBalanced}), and
Esnault, Shusterman and the second named author \cite{EsnShuSri} have shown that  for smooth projective varieties  $\piet(X,\bx)$ is still topologically finitely presented. Both results are based on a criterion for finite presentation of profinite groups due to Lubotzky \cite{Lubotzky}.

From now on, we will omit the base points.
\begin{theorem}[part of Thm.~1.1 of \cite{EsnShuSri}] 
\label{thm:ESS-main}
Let $X$ be a connected smooth  projective variety over an algebraically closed field $k$.
Then the \'etale fundamental group $\piet(X)$ is topologically finitely presented.
\end{theorem}

Our goal is to generalize Thm.~\ref{thm:ESS-main} to all connected schemes that are proper over $\Spec(k)$ (which is new only if $k$ has characteristic $p>0$). Such a generalization responds affirmatively to a question raised by Esnault.

\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:main}
Let $X$ be a connected scheme that is proper over $\Spec(k)$ for an algebraically closed field $k$. Then $\piet(X)$ is topologically finitely presented.
\end{theorem}

To prove the theorem, we use descent along an 
alteration map to $X$ and the van Kampen presentation of $\piet(X)$ arising in this way.
More precisely, we use this trick twice.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{The proof}
For a scheme $T$, let $\sfFEt_T$ denote the category of finite \'etale covers of $T$. This gives rise to a category fibred over schemes. Recall that a morphism $g:T' \to T$ of schemes is said to be of effective descent for $\sfFEt$, if $g^*$ induces an equivalence of categories between $\sfFEt_T$ and the category of descent data in $\sfFEt$ along $g$.

\begin{prop}[Exp.~IX, Thm.~4.12 of \cite{SGA1}]\label{prop:proper-effective-descent}
    Let $f: X ' \to X$ be a proper surjective morphism of finite presentation. Then $f$ is of effective descent for $\sfFEt$.
\end{prop}

Morphisms of effective descent $f : X' \to X$ for $\sfFEt$ give rise to a van Kampen-like presentation of $\piet(X)$ as the profinite completion of a quotient of the free topological product of the \'etale fundamental groups of the connected components of $X'$ and the usual topological fundamental group of a suitably defined ``dual graph''. 
This goes back to \cite[Exp.~IX, \S~5]{SGA1} and has been worked out in detail in \cite[Cor.~5.3]{Stix-vK}.

The existence of such a presentation allows one to ``descend'' finite generation/presentation of the fundamental groups involved, as made precise in the following proposition. Every statement below is about \emph{topological} finite generation/presentation.
\begin{prop}[Exp.~IX, Cor.~5.2 + Cor.~5.3 of \cite{SGA1}]\label{prop:fin-gen-pres-descent}
  Let $f: X' \to X$ be a morphism of effective descent for $\sfFEt$. We denote $X' \times_X X'$ by $X''$ and $X' \times_X X' \times_X X'$ by $X'''$.
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item \label{prop:pt:fin-gen-descent} Assume that $X', X''$ have finite $\pi_0$'s and that  $\piet$'s of the connected components of $X'$ are finitely generated. Then $\piet(X)$ is finitely generated.
  \item \label{prop:pt:fin-pres-descent} Assume that $X', X'', X'''$ have finite $\pi_0$'s, that  $\piet$'s of the connected components of $X'$ are  of finite presentation and that  $\piet$'s of the connected components of $X''$ are finitely generated. Then $\piet(X)$ is  of finite presentation. 
  \end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

Let us now recall a result of de Jong specialized to our setting.

\begin{prop}[see Thm.~4.1 of \cite{deJong-alterations}]\label{prop:alterations}
    Let $X$ be a scheme 
    that is 
    proper over $\Spec(k)$ for an algebraically closed field $k$. Then there exists a proper surjective morphism 
    (of finite presentation) 
    $f: X' \to X$ from a smooth projective variety $X'$ over $\Spec(k)$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  Let $\nu : X^\nu \to X$ be the normalization of $X$. The map $\nu$ is finite, and thus the scheme $X^\nu$ is still proper over $\Spec(k)$.

  Let then $f_1 : X' \to X^\nu$ be the alteration map of \cite[Thm.~4.1]{deJong-alterations} applied to each connected component of $X^\nu$. The map $f_1$  is proper, dominant, and thus surjective. Moreover,  \emph{loc.\ cit.\ }guarantees that $X'$ is regular and projective (and not merely proper!) over $\Spec(k)$. Now, as $k$ is algebraically closed, $X'$ is smooth over $\Spec(k)$. The composition $f = \nu \circ f_1 : X' \to X$ has all the requested properties.  
\end{proof}

We are now ready to finish the proof of the main result.
\begin{proof}[Proof of Thm.~\ref{thm:main}]
    Take $f : X' \to X$ as in Prop.~\ref{prop:alterations}. By 
    Thm.~\ref{thm:ESS-main} and Prop.~\ref{prop:proper-effective-descent} the map $f$ satisfies the assumptions for Prop.~\ref{prop:fin-gen-pres-descent}\ref{prop:pt:fin-gen-descent}. This shows that $\piet(X)$ is finitely generated, for any scheme $X$ that is proper over $\Spec(k)$. In fact, finite generation was already proven in \cite[Exp.~X, Thm.~2.9]{SGA1}, and we included the argument here for the convenience of the reader. 
    
    We are going to apply finite generation to the connected components of $X'' = X' \times_X X'$, which are connected proper schemes over $\Spec(k)$. Indeed, using Thm.~\ref{thm:ESS-main} (this time crucially!) and Prop.~\ref{prop:proper-effective-descent} again,     the map $f$ now satisfies the assumptions of Prop.~\ref{prop:fin-gen-pres-descent}\ref{prop:pt:fin-pres-descent}. This shows that $\piet(X)$ is finitely presented. 
\end{proof}

\section{More general base fields}

  Similarly to \cite[\S5]{EsnShuSri}, our main result extends to more arithmetic settings. We thank Peter Haine for  essentially suggesting the following corollary.

\begin{corollary}
Let $X$ be a connected scheme that is proper over $\Spec(k)$ for a field $k$. Then  $\piet(X)$ is finitely presented if and only if the absolute Galois group $\Gal_k$ is finitely presented.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
We may assume $X$ is reduced and thus $k' = \mathrm{H}^0(X,\calO_X)$ is a finite field extension of $k$. Let $\bar k$ be an algebraic closure of $k$ containing $k'$. Then $X \to \Spec(k')$ being the Stein factorization of $X \to \Spec(k)$ implies that $\bar X = X \times_{k'} \bar k$ is connected. By Thm.~\ref{thm:main}, the group $\pi_1(\bar X)$ is finitely presented. The fundamental exact sequence \cite[Exp.~IX, Thm.~6.1]{SGA1} 
\[
1 \to \pi_1(\bar X) \to \pi_1(X) \to \Gal_{k'} \to 1
\]
shows that $\pi_1(X)$ is finitely presented if and only if $\Gal_{k'}$ is finitely presented. The latter is equivalent to $\Gal_k$ being finitely presented, see for example \cite[Prop.~2.3]{EsnSriSti}.
\end{proof}

\begin{rmk}
  Examples of fields $k$ with finitely presented $\Gal_k$ include: fields algebraic over a finite field, local $p$-adic fields, $\mathbb{R}$ and more generally real closed fields, $K((t))$ for a field of characteristic $0$ with $\Gal_K$ of finite presentation, and by \cite[Thm.~5.1]{Jarden} for a hilbertian field $k$, probabilistically almost always (for the Haar measure on $\Gal_k$) the fixed field $k^\Sigma$ in the separable closure $\bar k$ of a finite subset $\Sigma \subset \Gal_k$.

    "abstract": "A statistical, path-dependent framework to describe time-dependent macroscopic theories using the Principle of Maximum Caliber is presented. By means of this procedure, it is possible to infer predictive non-equilibrium statistical mechanical models from a variational principle, provided that the adequate time-dependent constraints and the state of the system at some specific times are given. The approach is exemplified by obtaining the description of a time-dependent Brownian particle from kinetic restrictions. We relate the predictive nature of a model to the structure of the prior distribution that represents the state of knowledge about the system before the dynamical constraints are considered. Non-predictive models are shown to be possible in the presented framework and as an example, retrodictive dynamics are obtained from the same kinetic constraints.",

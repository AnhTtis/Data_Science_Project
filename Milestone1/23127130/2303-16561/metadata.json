    "abstract": "Intrusion detection is an indispensable part of RPL security due to its nature opening to attacks from insider attackers. While there are a good deal of studies that analyze different types of attack and propose intrusion detection systems based on various techniques that are proposed in the literature, how to place such intrusion detection systems on RPL topology is not investigated. This is the main contribution of this study, and three intrusion detection architectures based on central and distributed placement of intrusion detection nodes are analyzed rigorously against different types of attacks and attackers at various locations in the RPL topology and evaluated from different aspects including their effectiveness, cost, and security.",

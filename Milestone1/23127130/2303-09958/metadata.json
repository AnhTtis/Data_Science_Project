    "abstract": "Sets satisfying Central sets theorem and other Ramsey theoretic large sets were studied extensively in literature. Hindman and Strauss proved that product of some of these large sets is again large. In this paper we show that if we take two combinatorially large sets along idempotent filters, then their product is also a filter large set. The techniques used here to prove our results are completely elementary in nature.",

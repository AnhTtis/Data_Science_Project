    "abstract": "Interesting phenomena happen when an eccentric rigid body is rolling on an inclined or horizontal plane. For example, a variety of motions between rolling and sliding is exhibited until suddenly a jump occurs. We provide a detailed theoretical description of the last effect for a general eccentric cylinder. Before the jump, when the cylinder moves along the ramp, we could assume a pure rolling motion, however it turns out that when the cylinder is reaching its jump position, both the normal and static frictional forces approach zero. Thus, it seems that there will no longer be sufficient force to maintain rolling without slip. In order to have a jump without slipping, we prove that the parameters that characterize the dynamic behavior of the cylinder must belong to some restricted region.",

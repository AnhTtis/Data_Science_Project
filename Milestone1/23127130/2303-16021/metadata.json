    "abstract": "A spatial active noise control (ANC) method based on the interpolation of a sound field from reference microphone signals is proposed. In most current spatial ANC methods, a sufficient number of error microphones are required to reduce noise over the target region because the sound field is estimated from error microphone signals. However, in practical applications, it is preferable that the number of error microphones is as small as possible to keep a space in the target region for ANC users. We propose to interpolate the sound field from reference microphones, which are normally placed outside the target region, instead of the error microphones. We derive a fixed filter for spatial noise reduction on the basis of the kernel ridge regression for sound field interpolation. Furthermore, to compensate for estimation errors, we combine the proposed fixed filter with multichannel ANC based on a transition of the control filter using the error microphone signals. Numerical experimental results indicate that regional noise can be sufficiently reduced by the proposed methods even when the number of error microphones is particularly small.",

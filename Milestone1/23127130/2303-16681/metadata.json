    "abstract": "The damped oscillating structures recently revealed by a three parametric formula from the proton ``effective'' form factor data extracted of the measured total cross section $σ^{bare}_{tot}(e^+e^-\\to p\\bar p)$ still seem to have an unknown origin. The conjectures of their direct manifestation of the quark-gluon structure of the proton indicate that they are not specific only of the proton and neutron, but they have to be one's own, similar to other hadrons.\n  Therefore, the oscillatory structures from the charged pion electromagnetic form factor timelike data, extracted of the process $e^+e^-\\to π^+ π^-$ are investigated by using the same procedure as in the case of the proton.\n  The analysis shows the appearance of the oscillating structures in the description of the charged pion electromagnetic form factor timelike data by three parametric formula with a rather large value of $χ^2/ndf$, while the description of the data by the physically well-founded Unitary and Analytic model has not revealed any damped oscillating structures.\n  From the obtained result on the most simple object of strong interactions, one can conclude that damped oscillating structures received from the ``effective'' proton form factor data are probably generated by a utilization of the improper three parametric formula which does not describe these data with sufficient precision.",

    "abstract": "This work introduces a decentralized mechanism for the fair and efficient\nallocation of limited renewable energy sources (RESs) among consumers in an\nenergy community. In the proposed non-cooperative game, the self-interested\ncommunity members independently decide whether to compete or not for access to\nRESs during peak hours and shift their loads analogously. In the peak hours, a\nproportional allocation policy is used to allocate the limited RESs among them.\nThe existence of a Nash equilibrium (NE) or dominant strategies in this\nnon-cooperative game is shown, and closed-form expressions of the renewable\nenergy demand and social cost are derived. Moreover, a decentralized algorithm\nfor choosing consumers' strategies that lie on NE states is designed. The work\nshows that the risk attitude of the consumers can have a significant impact on\nthe deviation of the induced social cost from the optimal. Besides, the\nproposed decentralized mechanism is shown to attain a much lower social cost\nthan one using the naive equal sharing policy.",

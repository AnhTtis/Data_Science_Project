    "abstract": "The determination of the absolute and relative position of a spacecraft is critical for its operation, observations, data analysis, scientific studies, as well as deep space exploration in general. A spacecraft that can determine its own absolute position autonomously may perform more than that must rely on transmission solutions. In this work, we report an absolute navigation accuracy of $\\sim$ 20 km using 16-day Crab pulsar data observed with $Fermi$ Gamma ray Burst Monitor (GBM). In addition, we propose a new method with the inverse process of the triangulation for joint navigation using repeated bursts like that from the magnetar SGR J1935+2154 observed by the Gravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor (GECAM) and GBM.",

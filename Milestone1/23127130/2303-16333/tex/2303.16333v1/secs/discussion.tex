\section{Discussion}
We presented a method to apply flow supervision for deformable NeRF. We demonstrated that our method significantly improves view synthesis quality of deformable NeRF on videos with lower effective multi-view factors. However, due to the ambiguities of the monocular 3D reconstruction problem, our method has following \textbf{limitations:} (i) our method is not able to recover correct relative scale of moving objects (see Fig.~\ref{fig:scale_issue}); (ii) our method can be sensitive to the selection of canonical frame if there is large object deformations (see Fig.~\ref{fig:can_issue}); (iii) it requires sufficient motion parallax and does not work for fixed or small camera motion; (iv) Long optimization time is required, but could be sped up using more efficient implementation \cite{mueller2022instant}.

(v) our current implementation assumes frontal cameras, support for inward or outward cameras are in progress.

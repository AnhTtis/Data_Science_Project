    "abstract": "DANTE is a new Digital Pulse Processor (DPP) developed for fluorescence detectors, like silicon drift detectors (SDDs) or High Purity Germanium detectors (HPGe), used in X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) and X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) experiments at synchrotron facilities. Its main features are its optimal energy resolution and peak stability for detector count rate values up to 1-2 Mcps, and its enhanced rejection of pile-up events. In this paper, we present the first complete evaluation of DANTE performance in SOLEIL synchrotron facility. DANTE has been tested in laboratory with an X-ray generator source and in different experiments at LUCIA and PUMA beamlines at SOLEIL.",

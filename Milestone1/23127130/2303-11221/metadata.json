    "abstract": "Using YouTube Kids as an example, in this work, we argue the need to understand a child's interaction process with AI and its broader implication on a child's emotional, social, and creative development. We present several design recommendations to create value-driven interaction in child-centric AI that can guide designing compelling, age-appropriate, beneficial AI experiences for children.",

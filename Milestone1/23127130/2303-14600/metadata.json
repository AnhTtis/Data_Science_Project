    "abstract": "An integer-valued multiplicative function $f$ is said to be polynomially-defined if there is a nonconstant separable polynomial $F(T)\\in \\mathbb{Z}[T]$ with $f(p)=F(p)$ for all primes $p$. We study the distribution in coprime residue classes of polynomially-defined multiplicative functions, establishing equidistribution results allowing a wide range of uniformity in the modulus $q$. For example, we show that the values $φ(n)$, sampled over integers $n \\le x$ with $φ(n)$ coprime to $q$, are asymptotically equidistributed among the coprime classes modulo $q$, uniformly for moduli $q$ coprime to $6$ that are bounded by a fixed power of $\\log{x}$.",

    "abstract": "For a class of robustly transitive diffeomorphisms on $\\mathbb T^4$ introduced by Shub in [24], satisfying an additional bunching condition, we show that there exits a $C^2$ open and $C^r$ dense subset $\\mathcal U^r$, $2\\leq r\\leq\\infty$, such that any two hyperbolic points of $g\\in \\mathcal U^r$ with stable index $2$ are homoclinically related. As a consequence, every $g\\in \\mathcal U^r$ admits a unique homoclinic class associated to the hyperbolic periodic points with index $2$, and this homoclinic class coincides to the whole ambient manifold. Moreover, every $g\\in \\mathcal U^r$ admits at most one measure with maximal entropy, and every $g\\in\\mathcal U^{\\infty}$ admits a unique measure of maximal entropy.",

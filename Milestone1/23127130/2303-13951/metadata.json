    "abstract": "This paper is aimed to identify some new characterizations and representations of the Minkowski inverse in Minkowski space. First of all, a few representations of {1,3m}, {1,2,3m}, {1,4m} and {1,2,4m}-inverses are given in order to represent the Minkowski inverse. Secondly, some famous characterizations of the Moore-Penrose inverse are extended to that of the Minkowski inverse. Thirdly, using the Hartwig-Spindelböck decomposition we present a representation of the Minkowski inverse. And, based on this result, an interesting characterization of the Minkowski inverse is showed by a rank equation. Finally, we obtain several new representations of the Minkowski inverse in a more general form, by which the Minkowski inverse of a class of block matrices is given.",

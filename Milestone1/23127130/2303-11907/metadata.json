    "abstract": "The proposal \"no boundary\" of physicists Hartle and Hawking seeks to build a satisfactory model of the early Universe, in a way that avoids the singularity \"Big Bang\" of the beginning of the Universe. As a consequence of this proposal, the concept of metric signature change arises, which is approached in different ways in the literature. Here, we reinterpret the Mansouri-Nozari approach, which modifies the FLRW metric, and uses the formalism of Colombeau's Algebras, to develop its equations. In addition, we write the function that changes the sign in terms of redshift. Finally, we developed Friedmann's equations, of the modified metric, as well as the equation of state and other relevant equations in Cosmology.",

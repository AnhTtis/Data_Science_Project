    "abstract": "I study several aspects of the path(st) integral we formulated in previous papers on energetic causal sets with Cortes and others. The focus here is on quantum field theories, including the standard model of particle physics. I show that the the theory can be extended to a quantum field theory, cut off in momentum space. Fields of spin 0, 1/2 and 1 may be naturally included, which allows us to formulate the standard model in this framework. The theory is at first formulated in momentum space. Under certain conditions, spacetime can emerge in a semiclassical limit. The theory comes with a $uv$ cutoff in momentum space, $μ$, hence that is also a scale for lorentz invariance to break down. Traditionally, m is taken to be. a Planck energy, but we explore as a possibility making m smaller.",

  abstract = {We develop a method to study coupled dynamics of gauge-invariant variables, constructed out of metric and gauge field fluctuations on the background of a AdS{$_5$} Reissner-Nordstr\"om black brane. Using this method, we compute the numerical spectrum of quasinormal modes associated with fluctuations of spin 0, 1 and 2, non-perturbatively in \$\textbackslash mu/T\$. We also analytically compute the spectrum of hydrodynamic excitations in the small chemical potential limit. Then, by studying the spectral curve at complex momenta in every spin channel, we numerically find points at which hydrodynamic and non-hydrodynamic poles collide. We discuss the relation between such collision points and the convergence radius of the hydrodynamic derivative expansion. Specifically in the spin 0 channel, we find that within the range \$1.1\textbackslash lesssim \textbackslash mu/T\textbackslash lesssim 2\$, the radius of convergence of the hydrodynamic sound mode is set by the absolute value of the complex momentum corresponding to the point at which the sound pole collides with the hydrodynamic diffusion pole. It shows that in holographic systems at finite chemical potential, the convergence of the hydrodynamic derivative expansion in the mentioned range is fully controlled by hydrodynamic information. As the last result, we explicitly show that the relevant information about quantum chaos in our system can be extracted from the pole-skipping points of energy density response function. We find a threshold value for \$\textbackslash mu/T\$, lower than which the pole-skipping points can be computed perturbatively in a derivative expansion.},

  abstract = {It is well-known that chiral anomaly can be macroscopically detected through the energy and charge transport, due to the chiral magnetic effect. On the other hand, in a holographic many body system, the chaotic modes might be only associated with the energy conservation. This suggests that, perhaps, one can detect microscopic anomalies through the diagnosis of quantum chaos in such systems. To investigate this idea, we consider a magnetized brane in AdS space time with a Chern-Simons coupling in the bulk. By studying the shock wave geometry in this background, we first compute the corresponding butterfly velocities, in the presence of an external magnetic field \$B\$, in \$\textbackslash mu\textbackslash ll T\$ and \$ B \textbackslash ll T\^2\$ limit. We find that the butterfly propagation in the direction of \$B\$ has a different velocity than in the opposite direction. The splitting of butterfly velocities confirms the idea that chiral anomaly can be macroscopically manifested via quantum chaos. We then show that the pole-skipping points of energy density Green's function of the boundary theory coincide precisely with the chaos points. This might be regarded as the hydrodynamic origin of quantum chaos in an anomalous system. Additionally, by studying the near horizon dynamics of a scalar field on the above background, we find the spectrum of pole-skipping points associated with the two-point function of dual boundary operator. We find that the sum of wavenumbers corresponding to pole-skipping points at a specific Matsubara frequency is a universal quantity, which is independent of the scaling dimension of the dual boundary operator. We then show that this quantity follows from a closed formula and can be regarded as another macroscopic manifestation of the chiral anomaly.},

Type-III can arise at non-integer i{$\omega$} values, which is due to a specific UV condition, contrary to the types I and II, which are related to a non-unique near horizon boundary condition. We also clarify the relation between the pole-skipping structure of the Green's function and the near horizon analysis.

The curved space-times that will be taken into account are the ones that suitably approach, at infinity, Minkowski space-time. In particular we will focus on asymptotically flat space-times. In this work the concept of asymptotic symmetry group of those space-times will be studied. In the first two sections we derive the asymptotic group following the classical approach which was basically developed by Bondi, van den Burg, Metzner and Sachs. This is essentially the group of transformations between coordinate systems of a certain type in asymptotically flat space-times. In the third section the conformal method and the notion of asymptotic simplicity are introduced, following mainly the works of Penrose. This section prepares us for another derivation of the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs group which will involve the conformal structure, and is thus more geometrical and fundamental. In the subsequent sections we discuss the properties of the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs group, e.g. its algebra and the possibility to obtain as its subgroup the Poincar\textbackslash 'e group, as we may expect. The paper ends with a review of the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs invariance properties of classical gravitational scattering discovered by Strominger, that are finding application to black hole physics and quantum gravity in the literature.},

The Physics Performance Report (PPR) will give an updated and comprehensive summary of the current status and performance of the various ALICE subsystems, including updates to the Technical Design Reports, where appropriate, as well as a description of systems which have not been published in a Technical Design Report. The PPR will be published in two volumes. The currentVolume I contains: 1. a short theoretical overview and an extensive reference list concerning the physics topics of interest to ALICE, 2. relevant experimental conditions at the LHC, 3. a short summary and update of the subsystem designs, and 4. a description of the offline framework and Monte Carlo generators. Volume II, which will be published separately, will contain detailed simulations of combined detector performance, event reconstruction, and analysis of a representative sample of relevant physics observables from global event characteristics to hard processes.},

The method is that employed by Jaff\'e in his determination of the electronic spectra of the hydrogen molecule ion in 1934, and analytic representations of the quasi-normal mode wavefunctions are presented here for the first time. Numerical solution of Jaff\'e's characteristic equation indicates that for each               l               -pole there is an infinite number of damped Schwarzschild quasi-normal modes. The real parts of the corresponding frequencies are bounded, but the imaginary parts are not. Figures are presented that illustrate the trajectories the five least-damped of these frequencies trace in the complex frequency plane as the angular momentum of the black hole increases from zero to near the Kerr limit of maximum angular momentum per unit mass,               a               =               M               , where there is a coalescence of the more highly damped frequencies to the purely real value of the critical frequency for superradiant scattering.},

When constructed using a complex-frequency approach the necessary Green's function splits into three components. We discuss all of these in some detail: 1) The contribution from the singularities (the quasinormal modes of the black hole) is approximated and the mode-sum is demonstrated to converge after a certain well defined time in the evolution. A dynamic description of the mode-excitation is introduced and tested. 2) It is shown how a straightforward low-frequency approximation to the integral along the branch cut in the black-hole Green's function leads to the anticipated power-law fall off at very late times. We also calculate higher order corrections to this tail and show that they provide an important complement to the leading order. 3) The high-frequency problem is also considered. We demonstrate that the combination of the obtained approximations for the quasinormal modes and the power-law tail provide a complete description of the evolution at late times. Problems that arise (in the complex-frequency picture) for early times are also discussed, as is the fact that many of the presented results generalize to, for example, Kerr black holes.},

  abstract = {It was recently shown that spacetime singularities in numerical relativity could be avoided by excising a region inside the apparent horizon in numerical evolutions. In this paper we report on the details of the implementation of this scheme. The scheme is based on using (1)\textasciitilde a horizon locking coordinate which locks the coordinate system to the geometry, and (2)\textasciitilde a finite differencing scheme which respects the causal structure of the spacetime. We show that the horizon locking coordinate can be affected by a number of shift conditions, such as a ``distance freezing'' shift, an ``area freezing'' shift, an ``expansion freezing'' shift, or the minimal distortion shift. The causal differencing scheme is illustrated with the evolution of scalar fields, and its use in evolving the Einstein equations is studied. We compare the results of numerical evolutions with and without the use of this horizon boundary condition scheme for spherical black hole spacetimes. With the boundary condition a black hole can be evolved accurately well beyond \$t=1000 M\$, where \$M\$ is the black hole mass.},

We continue this investigation in this paper. Having in mind a S-matrix approach with future and past null infinity playing the role of holographic screens on which the BMS group acts, we connect the IR sectors of the gravitational field with the representation theory of the BMS group. We analyze the (complicated) mapping between bulk and boundary symmetries pointing out differences with respect to the AdS/CFT set up. Finally we construct a BMS phase space and a free hamiltonian for fields transforming w.r.t BMS representations. The last step is supposed to be an explorative investigation of the boundary data living on the degenerate null manifold at infinity.},

Special emphasis is placed on the effective Schrodinger problems for axial and polar perturbations that realize supersymmetric partner potential barriers on the half-line. Using the holographic renormalization method, we compute the energy-momentum tensor for perturbations satisfying arbitrary boundary conditions at spatial infinity and discuss some aspects of the problem in the hydrodynamic representation. It is also observed in this general framework that the energy-momentum tensor of black hole perturbations and the energy momentum tensor of the gravitational Chern-Simons action (known as Cotton tensor) exhibit an axial-polar duality with respect to appropriately chosen supersymmetric partner boundary conditions on the effective Schrodinger wave-functions. This correspondence applies to perturbations of very large AdS4 black holes with shear viscosity to entropy density ratio equal to 1/4\textbackslash pi, thus providing a dual graviton description of their hydrodynamic modes. We also entertain the idea that the purely dissipative modes of black hole hydrodynamics may admit Ricci flow description in the non-linear regime.},

Further we show that this shock wave profile is directly related to the behaviour of energy fluctuations in the boundary theory. In particular, we demonstrate using the Teukolsky formalism that at complex frequency {$\omega{_\ast}$} = i2{$\pi$}T there exists an extra ingoing solution to the linearised Einstein equations whenever the angular profile of metric perturbations near the horizon satisfies this shock wave equation. As a result, for metric perturbations with such temporal and angular profiles we find that the energy density response of the boundary theory exhibit the signatures of ``pole-skipping'' \textemdash{} namely, it is undefined, but exhibits a collective mode upon a parametrically small deformation of the profile. Additionally, we provide an explicit computation of the OTOC in the equatorial plane for slowly rotating large black holes, and show that its form can be used to obtain constraints on the dispersion relations of collective modes in the dual CFT.},

  abstract = {We explore a new class of general properties of thermal holographic Green's functions that can be deduced from the near-horizon behaviour of classical perturbations in asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes. We show that at negative imaginary Matsubara frequencies and appropriate complex values of the wavenumber the retarded Green's functions of generic operators are not uniquely defined, due to the lack of a unique ingoing solution for the bulk perturbations. From a boundary perspective these `pole-skipping' points correspond to locations in the complex frequency and momentum planes at which a line of poles of the retarded Green's function intersects with a line of zeroes. As a consequence the dispersion relations of collective modes in the boundary theory at energy scales {$\omega$} {$\sim$} T are directly constrained by the bulk dynamics near the black-brane horizon. For the case of conserved U (1) current and energy-momentum tensor operators we give examples where the dispersion relations of hydrodynamic modes pass through a succession of pole- skipping points as real wavenumber is increased. We discuss implications of our results for transport, hydrodynamics and quantum chaos in holographic systems.},

  abstract = {Recent developments have indicated that in addition to out-of-time ordered correlation functions (OTOCs), quantum chaos also has a sharp manifestation in the thermal energy density two-point functions, at least for maximally chaotic systems. The manifestation, referred to as pole-skipping, concerns the analytic behaviour of energy density two-point functions around a special point \$\o mega = i \textbackslash lambda\$, \$k = i \textbackslash lambda/v\_B\$ in the complex frequency and momentum plane. Here {$\lambda$} and \$v\_B\$ are the Lyapunov exponent and butterfly velocity characterising quantum chaos. In this paper we provide an argument that the phenomenon of pole-skipping is universal for general finite temperature systems dual to Einstein gravity coupled to matter. In doing so we uncover a surprising universal feature of the linearised Einstein equations around a static black hole geometry. We also study analytically a holographic axion model where all of the features of our general argument as well as the pole-skipping phenomenon can be verified in detail.},

  abstract = {Recent studies of out-of-time ordered thermal correlation functions (OTOC) in holographic systems and in solvable models such as the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model have yielded new insights into manifestations of many-body chaos. So far the chaotic behavior has been obtained through explicit calculations in specific models. In this paper we propose a unified description of the exponential growth and ballistic butterfly spreading of OTOCs across different systems using a newly formulated "quantum hydrodynamics," which is valid at finite \$\textbackslash hbar\$ and to all orders in derivatives. The scrambling of a generic few-body operator in a chaotic system is described as building up a "hydrodynamic cloud," and the exponential growth of the cloud arises from a shift symmetry of the hydrodynamic action. The shift symmetry also shields correlation functions of the energy density and flux, and time ordered correlation functions of generic operators from exponential growth, while leads to chaotic behavior in OTOCs. The theory also predicts an interesting phenomenon of the skipping of a pole at special values of complex frequency and momentum in two-point functions of energy density and flux. This pole-skipping phenomenon may be considered as a "smoking gun" for the hydrodynamic origin of the chaotic mode. We also discuss the possibility that such a hydrodynamic description could be a hallmark of maximally chaotic systems.},

While we can restrict the class of gauges in which such data may be expressed, there will still be an infinite-dimensional group of transformations allowed while remaining in this class, and almost as many different---though physically equivalent---waveforms as there are transformations. This paper presents a method for calculating the effects of the most important transformation group, the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) group, consisting of rotations, boosts, and supertranslations (which include time and space translations as special cases). To a reasonable approximation, these transformations result in simple coupling between the modes in a spin-weighted spherical-harmonic decomposition of the waveform. It is shown that waveforms from simulated compact binaries in the publicly available SXS waveform catalog contain unmodeled effects due to displacement and drift of the center of mass, accounting for mode-mixing at typical levels of 1\%. However, these effects can be mitigated by measuring the average motion of the system's center of mass for a portion of the inspiral, and applying the opposite transformation to the waveform data. More generally, controlling the BMS transformations will be necessary to eliminate the gauge ambiguity inherent in gravitational-wave data for both numerical and analytical waveforms. Open-source code implementing BMS transformations of waveforms is included along with this paper in the supplemental materials.},

For \$p=2\$, we show that the full dual geometry is algebraically special Petrov type II. The construction is a mathematically precise realization of suggestions of a holographic duality relating fluids and horizons which began with the membrane paradigm in the 70's and resurfaced recently in studies of the AdS/CFT correspondence.},

The physical significance of the SUSY generator and of the solutions at \$\O mega\$ in general is elucidated as follows. The RWE has no (quasinormal or total-transmission) modes at all; however, \$\O mega\$ is nonetheless `special' in that (a) for the outgoing wave into the horizon one has a `miraculous' cancellation of a divergence expected due to the exponential potential tail, and (b) the branch-cut discontinuity at \$\o mega=\O mega\$ vanishes in the outgoing wave to infinity. Moreover, (a) and (b) are related. For the ZE, its only mode is the-inverse-SUSY generator, which is at the same time a quasinormal mode\_and\_ a total-transmission mode propagating to infinity. The subtlety of these findings (of general relevance for future study of the equations on or near the negative imaginary \$\o mega\$-axis) may help explain why the situation has sometimes been controversial. For finite black-hole rotation, the algebraically special modes are shown to be totally transmitting, and the implied singular nature of the Schwarzschild limit is clarified. The analysis draws on a recent detailed investigation of SUSY in open systems [math-ph/9909030].},

  abstract = {The 'retarded' Green function for fields propagating on a Schwarzschild black hole spacetime possesses a branch cut on the complex frequency plane. Classically, the branch cut is important, for example, in order to fully determine the response of the black hole to a linear field perturbation. The branch cut is also useful for the calculation of the self-force on a point particle moving in the Schwarzschild background. In this paper we use techniques of analytic-continuation to the complex plane of the radial coordinate in order to calculate the branch cut contribution to the Green function in the limit of large imaginary frequency. It is expected that the contribution of this frequency regime to the perturbation response and to the self-force will be mostly for short time intervals. We also determine the highly-damped quasinormal mode frequencies for electromagnetic perturbations in Schwarzschild for the first time (previously only the leading imaginary part was known), which seem to have a 'deep connection' with the branch cut. We find that these frequencies behave like \$\textbackslash omega\_\{\textbackslash ell,n\}= -\textbackslash dfrac\{in\}\{2\}-\textbackslash dfrac\{i[\textbackslash ell(\textbackslash ell+1)]\^2\}\{2n\}+\textbackslash dfrac\{\textbackslash pi\^\{1/2\}(1-i)[\textbackslash ell(\textbackslash ell+1)]\^3\}\{2\^\{3/2\}n\^\{3/2\}\}+O(n\^\{-2\})\$. The highly-damped quasinormal modes are particularly interesting for theories of quantum gravity in that they are believed to probe the small scale structure of the spacetime.},

This self-force may be calculated by integrating the Green function for the wave equation over the past worldline of the small object. We compute the self-force in this way for the case of a scalar charge in Schwarzschild spacetime, making use of the semi-analytic method of matched Green function expansions. Inside a local neighbourhood of the compact object, this method uses the Hadamard form for the Green function in order to render regularization trivial. Outside this local neighbourhood, we calculate the Green function using a spectral decomposition into poles (quasinormal modes) and a branch cut integral in the complex-frequency plane. We show that both expansions overlap in a sufficiently large matching region for an accurate calculation of the self-force to be possible. The scalar case studied here is a useful and illustrative toy-model for the gravitational case, which serves to model astrophysical binary systems in the extreme mass-ratio limit.},

After Fourier decomposing the Green function, its two natural contributions are given by poles (quasinormal modes) and a largely unexplored branch cut in the complex-frequency plane. We present new analytic methods for calculating the branch cut on a Schwarzschild black hole for arbitrary values of the frequency. The branch cut yields a power-law tail decay for late times in the response of a black hole to an initial perturbation. We determine explicitly the first three orders in the power-law and show that the branch cut also yields a new logarithmic behaviour \$T\^\{-2\textbackslash ell-5\}\textbackslash ln(T)\$ for late times. Before the tail sets in, the quasinormal modes dominate the black hole response. For electromagnetic perturbations, the quasinormal mode frequencies approach the branch cut at large overtone index \$n\$. We determine these frequencies up to \$n\^\{-5/2\}\$ and, formally, to arbitrary order. Highly-damped quasinormal modes are of particular interest in that they have been linked to quantum properties of black holes.},

However, the polar modes get different from their GR counterparts when the scalar fields are excited at the background level. In such a case the polar modes are sourced by an additional massless scalar mode and, as a result, the isospectrality between the axial and the polar modes breaks down. We also perform a similar analysis for the predecessor of this model (DW-I) and arrive at the same conclusion for it.},

The Schwarzschild case with a power-law tail is exceptional among the class of the potentials having a logarithmic spatial dependence.

We propose that pole skipping is determined by the stress tensor contribution to many-body chaos, and the special point is at ({$\omega$}, p)p.s. = i{$\lambda$}(T )(1, 1/u(BT )), where {$\lambda$}(T ) = 2{$\pi$}/{$\beta$} and u(BT ) are the stress tensor contributions to the Lyapunov exponent and the butterfly velocity respectively. While this proposal is consistent with previous studies conducted for maximally chaotic theories, where the stress tensor dominates chaos, it clarifies that one cannot use pole skipping to extract the Lyapunov exponent of a theory, which obeys {$\lambda$} {$\leq$} {$\lambda$}(T ). On the other hand, in a large class of strongly coupled but non-maximally chaotic theories u(BT ) is the true butterfly velocity and we conjecture that uB {$\leq$} u(BT ) is a universal bound. While it remains a challenge to explain pole skipping in a general framework, we provide a stringent test of our proposal in the large-q limit of the SYK chain, where we determine {$\lambda$}, uB, and the energy density two point function in closed form for all values of the coupling, interpolating between the free and maximally chaotic limits. Since such an explicit expression for a thermal correlator is one of a kind, we take the opportunity to analyze many of its properties: the coupling dependence of the diffusion constant, the dispersion relations of poles, and the convergence properties of all order hydrodynamics.},

  author = {Chung, Adrian Ka-Wai and Li, Tjonnie G F},

  abstract = {One of the most fundamental results of general relativity is that the event horizon of black hole is purely ingoing. On the other hand, semiclassical-gravity effects, such as particle creation and the quantization of black-hole area, suggest that black holes can emit energy. Since a black hole is characterized by the presence of the event horizon, the emitted energy must be extracted from the black hole through its horizon. These considerations provide a motivation to test the validity of the purely ingoing nature of black-hole horizon. In this paper, we propose a novel test of the purely ingoing nature of black-hole horizon through gravitational-wave detection. We study the effects of hypothetical out-going gravitational waves to a perturbed black hole by supplementing the boundary condition of gravitational waves at the horizon with a phenomenological outgoing part. We show that this leads to extra excitation of the usual quasinormal modes of a perturbed black hole and continuous emission of gravitational waves. These additional signatures enable us to test the boundary condition(s) of the black-hole event horizon through gravitational-wave detection. Reanalysing the merger remnant of GW150914, we constrain the intensity of the outgoing gravitational-horizon flux to be {$<$} 1040W, which is roughly 10-9 of peak luminosity of GW150914.},

  abstract = {We define and extensively test a set of boundary conditions that can be applied at black hole excision surfaces when the Hamiltonian and momentum constraints of general relativity are solved within the conformal thin-sandwich formalism. These boundary conditions have been designed to result in black holes that are in quasiequilibrium and are completely general in the sense that they can be applied with any conformal three-geometry and slicing condition. Furthermore, we show that they retain precisely the freedom to specify an arbitrary spin on each black hole. Interestingly, we have been unable to find a boundary condition on the lapse that can be derived from a quasiequilibrium condition. Rather, we find evidence that the lapse boundary condition is part of the initial temporal gauge choice. To test these boundary conditions, we have extensively explored the case of a single black hole and the case of a binary system of equal-mass black holes, including the computation of quasi-circular orbits and the determination of the inner-most stable circular orbit. Our tests show that the boundary conditions work well.},

  abstract = {In the past ten years, the ideas of supersymmetry have been profitably applied to many nonrelativistic quantum mechanical problems. In particular, there is now a much deeper understanding of why certain potentials are analytically solvable and an array of powerful new approximation methods for handling potentials which are not exactly solvable. In this report, we review the theoretical formulation of supersymmetric quantum mechanics and discuss many applications. Exactly solvable potentials can be understood in terms of a few basic ideas which include supersymmetric partner potentials, shape invariance and operator transformations. Familiar solvable potentials all have the property of shape invariance. We describe new exactly solvable shape invariant potentials which include the recently discovered self-similar potentials as a special case. The connection between inverse scattering, isospectral potentials and supersymmetric quantum mechanics is discussed and multi-soliton solutions of the KdV equation are constructed. Approximation methods are also discussed within the framework of supersymmetric quantum mechanics and in particular it is shown that a supersymmetry inspired WKB approximation is exact for a class of shape invariant potentials. Supersymmetry ideas give particularly nice results for the tunneling rate in a double well potential and for improving large \$N\$ expansions. We also discuss the problem of a charged Dirac particle in an external magnetic field and other potentials in terms of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Finally, we discuss structures more general than supersymmetric quantum mechanics such as parasupersymmetric quantum mechanics in which there is a symmetry between a boson and a para-fermion of order \$p\$.},

We express the equations in a suitable double null gauge. To obtain decay, one must in fact add a residual pure gauge solution which we prove to be itself quantitatively controlled from initial data. Our result a fortiori includes decay statements for general solutions of the Teukolsky equation (satisfied by gauge-invariant null-decomposed curvature components). These latter statements are in fact deduced in the course of the proof by exploiting associated quantities shown to satisfy the Regge\textendash Wheeler equation, for which appropriate decay can be obtained easily by adapting previous work on the linear scalar wave equation. The bounds on the rate of decay to linearised Kerr are inverse polynomial, suggesting that dispersion is sufficient to control the non-linearities of the Einstein equations in a potential future proof of nonlinear stability. This paper is self-contained and includes a physical-space derivation of the equations of linearised gravity around Schwarzschild from the full non-linear Einstein vacuum equations expressed in a double null gauge.},

It turns out that in the boundary theory it is possible to find information about the radial size of the shell. The shell deforms the background spacetime, and the deformed background metric enters into the action of a generic bulk field. As a consequence, the correlators of operators coupling to the bulk field are modified. By studying the analytic structure of the correlators, we find that in the boundary theory there are unstable excitations (''shellons'') whose masses are multiples of a scale set by the radius of the shell. We also comment on the relation between black hole formation in the bulk and thermalization in the boundary.},

We also examine the corresponding properties of Einstein-Maxwell-axion theories on black brane geometries which interpolate from either AdS4 or AdS5 to an AdS2 \texttimes{} R2 or AdS2 \texttimes{} R3 near-horizon geometry. These provide holographic descriptions of non-quasiparticle metallic states without momentum conservation. We find a precise match between low temperature transport and thermodynamics of the SYK and holographic models. In both models the Seebeck transport coefficient is exactly equal to the Q-derivative of the entropy. For the SYK models, quantum chaos, as characterized by the butterfly velocity and the Lyapunov rate, universally determines the thermal diffusivity, but not the charge diffusivity.},

In four dimensions, our results generalize those of Couch and Newman, who found infinite families of time-dependent algebraically special perturbations. In higher dimensions, we find that the only regular algebraically special perturbations are those corresponding to deformations within the Myers-Perry family.

For astrophysical black holes, which have a negligible charge-to-mass ratio, the black hole quasi-normal mode spectrum is characterized entirely by the black hole mass and angular momentum and is unique to black holes. In a different theory of gravity, or if the observed radiation arises from a different source (e.g., a neutron star, strange matter or boson star), the spectrum will be inconsistent with that predicted for general relativistic black holes.

It is emphasized that a further condition is necessary for the system to be well posed; the ``prescribed curvature conditions" are therefore proposed to complete the coordinate conditions at the black hole. These conditions lead to a system of two 2D elliptic differential equations on the inner boundary surface, which coexist nicely to the 3D equation for maximal slicing (or related slicing conditions). The overall 2D/3D system is argued to be well posed and globally well behaved. The importance of ``boundary conditions without boundary values" is emphasized. This paper is the first of a series.

  abstract = {We provide dramatic evidence that `Mellin space' is the natural home for correlation functions in CFTs with weakly coupled bulk duals. In Mellin space, CFT correlators have poles corresponding to an OPE decomposition into `left' and `right' sub-correlators, in direct analogy with the factorization channels of scattering amplitudes. In the regime where these correlators can be computed by tree level Witten diagrams in AdS, we derive an explicit formula for the residues of Mellin amplitudes at the corresponding factorization poles, and we use the conformal Casimir to show that these amplitudes obey algebraic finite difference equations. By analyzing the recursive structure of our factorization formula we obtain simple diagrammatic rules for the construction of Mellin amplitudes corresponding to tree-level Witten diagrams in any bulk scalar theory. We prove the diagrammatic rules using our finite difference equations. Finally, we show that our factorization formula and our diagrammatic rules morph into the flat space S-Matrix of the bulk theory, reproducing the usual Feynman rules, when we take the flat space limit of AdS/CFT. Throughout we emphasize a deep analogy with the properties of flat space scattering amplitudes in momentum space, which suggests that the Mellin amplitude may provide a holographic definition of the flat space S-Matrix.},

  abstract = {Spectral methods are now common in the solution of ordinary differential eigenvalue problems in a wide variety of fields, such as in the computation of black hole quasinormal modes. Most of these spectral codes are based on standard Chebyshev, Fourier, or some other orthogonal basis functions. In this work we highlight the usefulness of a relatively unknown set of non-orthogonal basis functions, known as Bernstein polynomials, and their advantages for handling boundary conditions in ordinary differential eigenvalue problems. We also report on a new user-friendly package, called SpectralBP, that implements Berstein-polynomial-based pseudospectral routines for eigenvalue problems. We demonstrate the functionalities of the package by applying it to a number of model problems in quantum mechanics and to the problem of computing scalar and gravitational quasinormal modes in a Schwarzschild background. We validate our code against some known results and achieve excellent agreement. Compared to continued-fraction or series methods, global approximation methods are particularly well-suited for computing purely imaginary modes such as the algebraically special modes for Schwarzschild gravitational perturbations.},

We introduce here an effective description for perturbations around spherically symmetric spacetimes in the context of scalar-tensor theories, which we apply to study quasinormal modes for black holes with scalar hair. We derive the equations of motion governing the dynamics of both the polar and the axial modes in terms of the coefficients of the effective theory. Assuming the deviation of the background from Schwarzschild is small, we use the WKB method to introduce the notion of ``light ring expansion''. This approximation is analogous to the slow-roll expansion used for inflation, and it allows us to express the quasinormal mode spectrum in terms of a small number of parameters. This work is a first step in describing, in a model independent way, how the scalar hair can affect the ringdown stage and leave signatures on the emitted gravitational wave signal. Potential signatures include the shifting of the quasi-normal spectrum, the breaking of isospectrality between polar and axial modes, and the existence of scalar radiation.},

The standard paradigm for Massive Gravity is the Fierz-Pauli theory, which, nonetheless, displays well known flaws in its massless limit. The most serious one is represented by the vDVZ discontinuity, which consists in a disagreement between the massless limit of the Fierz-Pauli theory and General Relativity. Our approach is based on a field-theoretical treatment of Massive Gravity: General Relativity, in the weak field approximation, is treated as a gauge theory of a symmetric rank-2 tensor field. This leads us to propose an alternative theory of linearized Massive Gravity, describing five degrees of freedom of the graviton, with a good massless limit, without vDVZ discontinuity, and depending on one mass parameter only, in agreement with the Fierz-Pauli theory.},

An observer in these models will have an event horizon whose area can be interpreted as the entropy or lack of information of the observer about the regions which he cannot see. Associated with the event horizon is a surface gravity {$\kappa$} which enters a classical "first law of event horizons" in a manner similar to that in which temperature occurs in the first law of thermodynamics. It is shown that this similarity is more than an analogy: An observer with a particle detector will indeed observe a background of thermal radiation coming apparently from the cosmological event horizon. If the observer absorbs some of this radiation, he will gain energy and entropy at the expense of the region beyond his ken and the event horizon will shrink. The derivation of these results involves abandoning the idea that particles should be defined in an observer-independent manner. They also suggest that one has to use something like the Everett-Wheeler interpretation of quantum mechanics because the back reaction and hence the spacetime metric itself appear to be observer-dependent, if one assumes, as seems reasonable, that the detection of a particle is accompanied by a change in the gravitational field. \textcopyright{} 1977 The American Physical Society.},

The formalism is based on the 3+1 decomposition of General Relativity with maximal slicing and spatial harmonic gauge. The presence of the black hole is enforced using the notion of apparent horizon in equilibrium. This setting leads to the main result of this paper: a set of boundary conditions describing the horizon and that must be used when solving the 3+1 equations. Those conditions lead to a choice of coordinates that is regular even on the horizon itself. The whole procedure is validated with three different examples chosen to illustrate the great versatility of the method. First, the single rotating black holes are recovered up to very high values of the Kerr parameter. Second, non-rotating black holes coupled to a real scalar field, in the presence of a negative cosmological constant (the so-called MTZ black holes), are obtained. Last, black holes with complex scalar hairs are computed. Eventually, prospects for future work, in particular in contexts where stationarity is only approximate, are discussed. I.},

The information recovered from the shock wave can be reconstructed in terms of purely diffusionlike, linearized gravitational waves at the horizon of a single-sided black hole with specific regularity-enforced imaginary values of frequency and momentum. In two-derivative bulk theories, this horizon "diffusion" can be related to late-time momentum diffusion via a simple relation, which ceases to hold in higher-derivative theories. We then show that the same values of imaginary frequency and momentum follow from a dispersion relation of a hydrodynamic sound mode. The frequency, momentum, and group velocity give the holographic Lyapunov exponent and the butterfly velocity. Moreover, at this special point along the sound dispersion relation curve, the residue of the retarded longitudinal stress-energy tensor two-point function vanishes. This establishes a direct link between a hydrodynamic sound mode at an analytically continued, imaginary momentum and the holographic butterfly effect. Furthermore, our results imply that infinitely strongly coupled, large-Nc holographic theories exhibit properties similar to classical dilute gases; there, late-time equilibration and early-time scrambling are also controlled by the same dynamics.},

Examples of such bounds are shown along with holographic theories that can demonstrate the validity of the conditions involved.

In particular, we first consider Einstein-Hilbert gravity deformed by curvature-squared (\$R\^2\$) corrections and then type IIB supergravity theory with the \$\textbackslash alpha'\^3 R\^4\$ term, where \$\textbackslash alpha'\$ is set by the length of the fundamental string. The former case allows us to discuss the effects of leading-order \$1/N\_c\$ corrections (with \$N\_c\$ being the number of colours of the dual gauge group) and phenomenological coupling constant dependence. In Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory, pole-skipping turns out to be valid non-perturbatively in the Gauss-Bonnet coupling. The \$\textbackslash alpha'\^3 R\^4\$ deformation enables us to study perturbative inverse 't Hooft coupling corrections (\$\textbackslash alpha'\^3 \textbackslash sim 1 / \textbackslash lambda\^\{3/2\}\$) in \$SU(N\_c)\$, \$\textbackslash mathcal\{N\} = 4\$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with infinite \$N\_c\$. While the maximal Lyapunov exponent characterising quantum chaos remains uncorrected, the butterfly velocity is shown to depend both on \$N\_c\$ and the coupling. Several implications of the relation between hydrodynamics and chaos are discussed, including an intriguing similarity between the dependence of the butterfly velocity and the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density on stringy corrections.},

In this article, we propose a higher dimensional generalization of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, which is a lattice model with \$N\$ Majorana fermions at each site and random interactions between them. Our model can be defined on arbitrary lattices in arbitrary spatial dimensions. In the large \$N\$ limit, the higher dimensional model preserves many properties of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model such as local criticality in two-point functions, zero temperature entropy and chaos measured by the out-of-time-ordered correlation functions. In addition, we obtain new properties unique to higher dimensions such as diffusive energy transport and a "butterfly velocity" describing the propagation of chaos in space. We mainly present results for a \$(1+1)\$-dimensional example, and discuss the general case near the end.},

  abstract = {We study two novel approaches to efficiently encoding universal constraints imposed by conformal symmetry, and describe applications to quantum chaos in higher dimensional CFTs. The first approach consists of a reformulation of the shadow operator formalism and kinematic space techniques. We observe that the shadow operator associated with the stress tensor (or other conserved currents) can be written as the descendant of a field \$\{\textbackslash cal E\}\$ with negative dimension. Computations of stress tensor contributions to conformal blocks can be systematically organized in terms of the "soft mode" \$\{\textbackslash cal E\}\$, turning them into a simple diagrammatic perturbation theory at large central charge. Our second (equivalent) approach concerns a theory of reparametrization modes, generalizing previous studies in the context of the Schwarzian theory and two-dimensional CFTs. Due to the conformal anomaly in even dimensions, gauge modes of the conformal group acquire an action and are shown to exhibit the same dynamics as the soft mode \$\{\textbackslash cal E\}\$ that encodes the physics of the stress tensor shadow. We discuss the calculation of the conformal partial waves or the conformal blocks using our effective field theory. The separation of conformal blocks from shadow blocks is related to gauging of certain symmetries in our effective field theory of the soft mode. These connections explain and generalize various relations between conformal blocks, shadow operators, kinematic space, and reparametrization modes. As an application we study thermal physics in higher dimensions and argue that the theory of reparametrization modes captures the physics of quantum chaos in Rindler space. This is also supported by the observation of the pole skipping phenomenon in the conformal energy-energy two-point function on Rindler space.},

This thermal emission leads to a slow decrease in the mass of the black hole and to its eventual disappearance: any primordial black hole of mass less than about 1015 g would have evaporated by now. Although these quantum effects violate the classical law that the area of the event horizon of a black hole cannot decrease, there remains a Generalized Second Law: S+1/4 A never decreases where S is the entropy of matter outside black holes and A is the sum of the surface areas of the event horizons. This shows that gravitational collapse converts the baryons and leptons in the collapsing body into entropy. It is tempting to speculate that this might be the reason why the Universe contains so much entropy per baryon. \textcopyright{} 1975, Springer-Verlag. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {We consider charge transport properties of 2+1 dimensional conformal field theories at non-zero temperature. For theories with only Abelian U(1) charges, we describe the action of particle-vortex duality on the hydrodynamic-to-collisionless crossover function: this leads to powerful functional constraints for self-dual theories. For the n=8 supersymmetric, SU(N) Yang-Mills theory at the conformal fixed point, exact hydrodynamic-to-collisionless crossover functions of the SO(8) R-currents can be obtained in the large N limit by applying the AdS/CFT correspondence to M-theory. In the gravity theory, fluctuating currents are mapped to fluctuating gauge fields in the background of a black hole in 3+1 dimensional anti-de Sitter space. The electromagnetic self-duality of the 3+1 dimensional theory implies that the correlators of the R-currents obey a functional constraint similar to that found from particle-vortex duality in 2+1 dimensional Abelian theories. Thus the 2+1 dimensional, superconformal Yang Mills theory obeys a "holographic self duality" in the large N limit, and perhaps more generally.},

Using out-of-time-order correlation functions to diagnose chaos, we characterize the ability of a channel to process quantum information. We show that the generic decay of such correlators implies that any input subsystem must have near vanishing mutual information with almost all partitions of the output. Additionally, we propose the negativity of the tripartite information of the channel as a general diagnostic of scrambling. This measures the delocalization of information and is closely related to the decay of out-of-time-order correlators. We back up our results with numerics in two non-integrable models and analytic results in a perfect tensor network model of chaotic time evolution. These results show that the butterfly effect in quantum systems implies the information-theoretic definition of scrambling.},

  abstract = {It is well known that asymptotically flat black holes in general relativity have a vanishing static, conservative tidal response. We show that this is a result of linearly realized symmetries governing static (spin 0,1,2) perturbations around black holes. The symmetries have a geometric origin: in the scalar case, they arise from the (E)AdS isometries of a dimensionally reduced black hole spacetime. Underlying the symmetries is a ladder structure which can be used to construct the full tower of solutions, and derive their general properties: (1) solutions that decay with radius spontaneously break the symmetries, and must diverge at the horizon; (2) solutions regular at the horizon respect the symmetries, and take the form of a finite polynomial that grows with radius. Taken together, these two properties imply that static response coefficients\textemdash and in particular Love numbers\textemdash vanish. Moreover, property (1) alone is sufficient to forbid the existence of black holes with linear (perturbative) hair. We also discuss the manifestation of these symmetries in the effective point particle description of a black hole, showing explicitly that for scalar probes the worldline couplings associated with a non-trivial tidal response and scalar hair must vanish in order for the symmetries to be preserved.},

We first review a gauge-invariant formalism for linear perturbations in a fairly generic class of (m+n)-dimensional spacetimes with a warped product metric, including black hole geometry. We classify perturbations of such a background into three types, the tensor, vector and scalar-type, according to their tensorial behaviour on the n-dimensional part of the background spacetime, and for each type of perturbations, we introduce a set of manifestly gauge invariant variables. We then introduce harmonic tensors and write down the equations of motion for the expansion coefficients of the gauge invariant perturbation variables in terms of the harmonics. In particular, for the tensor-type perturbations a single master equation is obtained in the (m+n)-dimensional background, which is applicable for perturbation analysis of not only static black holes but also some class of rotating black holes as well as black-branes. For the vector and scalar type, we derive a set of decoupled master equations when the background is a (2+n)-dimensional static black hole in the Einstein-Maxwell theory with a cosmological constant. As an application of the master equations, we review the stability analysis of higher dimensional charged static black holes with a cosmological constant. We also briefly review the recent results of a generalisation of the perturbation formulae presented here and stability analysis to static black holes in generic Lovelock theory.},

  abstract = {A perturbed black hole rings down by emitting gravitational waves in tones with specific frequencies and durations. Such tones encode prized information about the geometry of the source spacetime and the fundamental nature of gravity, making the measurement of black hole ringdowns a key goal of gravitational wave astronomy. However, this task is plagued by technical challenges that invalidate the naive application of standard data analysis methods and complicate sensitivity projections. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive account of the formalism required to properly carry out ringdown analyses, examining in detail the foundations of recent observational results, and providing a framework for future measurements. We build on those insights to clarify the concepts of ringdown detectability and resolvability \textendash{} touching on the drawbacks of both Bayes factors and naive Fisher matrix approaches \textendash{} and find that overly pessimistic heuristics have led previous works to underestimate the role of ringdown overtones for black hole spectroscopy. We put our framework to work on the analysis of a variety of simulated signals in colored noise, including analytic injections and a numerical relativity simulation consistent with GW150914. We demonstrate that we can use tones of the quadrupolar angular harmonic to test the no-hair theorem at current sensitivity, with precision comparable to published constraints from real data. Finally, we assess the role of modeling systematics, and project measurements for future, louder signals. We release ringdown, a Python library for analyzing black hole ringdowns using the the methods discussed in this paper, under a permissive open-source license at https://github.com/maxisi/ringdown},

We see that the locations of the branch points extracted using the first approach are in good quantitative agreement with the radius of convergence extracted perturbatively. We see that for different values of the charge, different types of pole collisions set the radius of convergence. The latter turns out to be finite in the neutral case for all hydrodynamic modes, while it goes to zero at extremality for the shear and sound modes. Furthermore, we also establish the phenomenon of pole-skipping for the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole, and we find that the value of the momentum for which this phenomenon occurs need not be within the radius of convergence of hydrodynamics.},

  abstract = {We study the scrambling of local quantum information in chaotic many-body systems in the presence of a locally conserved quantity like charge or energy that moves diffusively. The interplay between conservation laws and scrambling sheds light on the mechanism by which unitary quantum dynamics, which is reversible, gives rise to diffusive hydrodynamics, which is a slow dissipative process. We obtain our results in a random quantum circuit model that is constrained to have a conservation law. We find that a generic spreading operator consists of two parts: (i) a conserved part which comprises the weight of the spreading operator on the local conserved densities, whose dynamics is described by diffusive charge spreading; this conserved part also acts as a source that steadily emits a flux of (ii) nonconserved operators. This emission leads to dissipation in the operator hydrodynamics, with the dissipative process being the slow conversion of operator weight from local conserved operators to nonconserved, at a rate set by the local diffusion current. The emitted nonconserved parts then spread ballistically at a butterfly speed, thus becoming highly nonlocal and, hence, essentially nonobservable, thereby acting as the "reservoir" that facilitates the dissipation. In addition, we find that the nonconserved component develops a power-law tail behind its leading ballistic front due to the slow dynamics of the conserved components. This implies that the out-of-time-order commutator between two initially separated operators grows sharply upon the arrival of the ballistic front, but, in contrast to systems with no conservation laws, it develops a diffusive tail and approaches its asymptotic late-time value only as a power of time instead of exponentially. We also derive these results within an effective hydrodynamic description which contains multiple coupled diffusion equations.},

Our formulation applies to the case of vanishing as well as non-vanishing cosmological constant Lambda. The sign of the sectional curvature K of each spatial section of equipotential surfaces is also kept general. In the four-dimensional Schwarzschild background, this master equation for a scalar perturbation is identical to the Zerilli equation for the polar mode and the master equation for a vector perturbation is identical to the Regge-Wheeler equation for the axial mode. Furthermore, in the four-dimensional Schwarzschild-anti-de Sitter background with K=0,1, our equation coincides with those derived by Cardoso and Lemos recently. As a simple application, we prove the perturbative stability and uniqueness of four-dimensional non-extremal spherically symmetric black holes for any Lambda. We also point out that there exists no simple relation between scalar-type and vector-type perturbations in higher dimensions, unlike in four dimensions. Although we only treat maximally symmetric black holes in the present paper, the final master equations are valid even when the hirozon geometry is described by a generic Einstein manifold.},

We argue that in quantum spin and fermionic systems, where all local operators are bounded, an OTOC of local observables is bounded as well and thus its exponential growth is merely transient. As a better measure of quantum chaos in such systems, we propose, and study, the density of the OTOC of extensive sums of local observables, which can exhibit indefinite growth in the thermodynamic limit. We demonstrate this for the kicked quantum Ising model by using large-scale numerical results and an analytic solution in the integrable regime. In a generic case, we observe the growth of the OTOC density to be linear in time. We prove that this density in general, locally interacting, non-integrable quantum spin and fermionic dynamical systems exhibits growth that is at most polynomial in time---a phenomenon, which we term weak quantum chaos. In the special case of the model being integrable and the observables under consideration quadratic, the OTOC density saturates to a plateau.},

It has been recently shown that these wave equations possess an infinite number of symmetries that correspond to the flow of the infinite hierarchy of Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equations. As a consequence, the infinite set of associated conserved quantities, the KdV integrals, are the same for all the different master equations that we can consider. In this paper we show that the BH scattering reflection and transmission coefficients characterizing the continuous spectrum can be fully determined via a moment problem, in such a way that the KdV integrals provide the momenta of a distribution function depending only on the reflection coefficient. We also discuss the existence and uniqueness of solutions, strategies to solve the moment problem, and finally show the case of the P\textbackslash "oschl-Teller potential where all the steps can be carried out analytically.},

  abstract = {Perturbation theory of vacuum spherically symmetric spacetimes is a crucial tool for understanding the dynamics of black hole perturbations. Spherical symmetry allows for an expansion of the perturbations in scalar, vector, and tensor harmonics. The resulting perturbative equations are decoupled for modes with different parity and different harmonic numbers. Moreover, for each harmonic and parity, the equations for the perturbations can be decoupled in terms of (gauge-invariant) master functions that satisfy wave equations. By working in a completely general perturbative gauge, in this paper we study what is the most general master function that is linear in the metric perturbations and their first-order derivatives and satisfies a wave equation with a potential. The outcome of the study is that for each parity we have two branches of solutions with similar features. One of the branches includes the known results: In the odd-parity case, the most general master function is an arbitrary linear combination of the Regge-Wheeler and the Cunningham-Price-Moncrief master functions whereas in the even-parity case it is an arbitrary linear combination of the Zerilli master function and another master function that is new to our knowledge. The other branch is very different since it includes an infinite collection of potentials which in turn lead to an independent collection master of functions which depend on the potential. The allowed potentials satisfy a nonlinear ordinary differential equation. Finally, all the allowed master functions are gauge invariant and can be written in a fully covariant form.},

The conditions are studied for a system to have a supersymmetric(SUSY) partner with the same complex quasinormal-mode spectrum (or the same except for one eigenvalue). The discussion naturally includes total-transmission modes as well(incoming at one extreme and outgoing at the other). Several types of SUSY transformations emerge, and each is illustrated with examples, including the transformation among different Poschl-Teller potentials and the well-known identity in spectrum between the two parity sectors of linearized gravitational waves propagating on a Schwarzschild background. In contrast to the case of normal modes, there may be multiple essentially isospectral partners, each missing a different state. The SUSY transformation preserves orthonormality under a bilinear map which is the analog of the usual inner product for conservative systems. SUSY transformations can lead to doubled quasinormal and total-transmission modes; this phenomenon is analysed and illustrated. The existence or otherwise of SUSY partners is also relevant to the question of inversion: are open wave systems uniquely determined by their complex spectra?},

We apply this framework to bulk physics at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), both for standard (Glauber-type) as well as for color-glass-condensate (CGC) initial conditions and show that the results do not depend strongly on the values for the second-order transport coefficients. Results for multiplicity, radial flow and elliptic flow are presented, and we quote the ratio of viscosity over entropy density for which our hydrodynamic model is consistent with experimental data.

  abstract = {Trigonometric formulas are derived for certain families of associated Legendre functions of fractional degree and order, for use in approximation theory. These functions are algebraic, and when viewed as Gauss hypergeometric functions, belong to types classified by Schwarz, with dihedral, tetrahedral, or octahedral monodromy. The dihedral Legendre functions are expressed in terms of Jacobi polynomials. For the last two monodromy types, an underlying `octahedral' polynomial, indexed by the degree and order and having a non-classical kind of orthogonality, is identified, and recurrences for it are worked out. It is a (generalized) Heun polynomial, not a hypergeometric one. For each of these families of algebraic associated Legendre functions, a representation of the rank-2 Lie algebra so(5, C) is generated by the ladder operators that shift the degree and order of the corresponding solid harmonics. All such representations of so(5, C) are shown to have a common value for each of its two Casimir invariants. The Dirac singleton representations of so(3, 2) are included.},

These symmetries are spontaneously broken by the AdS2 geometry and they are explicitly broken by the small deformation away from AdS2. This pattern of spontaneous plus explicit symmetry breaking governs the gravitational backreaction of the system. It determines several gravitational properties such as the linear in temperature dependence of the near extremal entropy as well as the gravitational corrections to correlation functions. These corrections include the ones determining the growth of out of time order correlators that is indicative of chaos. These gravitational aspects can be described in terms of a Schwarzian derivative effective action for a reparametrization.},

We observe that, in this limit, we can still trust the near horizon geometry for large \$N\$. The enhanced supersymmetries of the near horizon geometry correspond to the extra supersymmetry generators present in the superconformal group (as opposed to just the super-Poincare group). The 't Hooft limit of 4-d \$\{\textbackslash cal N\} =4\$ super-Yang-Mills at the conformal point is shown to contain strings: they are IIB strings.

The formalism is applied to the typical problem of calculating the gravitational waves produced by material sources moving in the Schwarzschild spacetime. We examine the radiation escaping to future null infinity as well as the radiation crossing the event horizon. The waveforms, the energy radiated, and the angular-momentum radiated can all be expressed in terms of two gauge-invariant scalar functions that satisfy one-dimensional wave equations. The first is the Zerilli-Moncrief function, which satisfies the Zerilli equation, and which represents the even-parity sector of the perturbation. The second is the Cunningham-Price-Moncrief function, which satisfies the Regge-Wheeler equation, and which represents the odd-parity sector of the perturbation. The covariant forms of these wave equations are presented here, complete with covariant source terms that are derived from the stress-energy tensor of the matter responsible for the perturbation. Our presentation of the formalism is concluded with a separate examination of the monopole and dipole components of the metric perturbation.},

Nakamura, Class. Quantum Grav. \{\textbackslash bf 38\} (2021), 145010; K. Nakamura, Letters in High Energy Physics \{\textbackslash bf 2021\} (2021), 215.]. We first review our general framework of the gauge-invariant perturbation theory, which can be easily extended to the \{\i t higher-order\} perturbation theory. When we apply this general framework to perturbations on the Schwarzschild background spacetime, a gauge-invariant treatments of \$l=0,1\$ mode perturbations are required. On the other hand, in the current consensus on the perturbations of the Schwarzschild spacetime, gauge-invariant treatments for \$l=0,1\$ modes are difficult if we keep the reconstruction of the original metric perturbations in our mind. Based on this situation, we propose a strategy of a gauge-invariant treatments of \$l=0,1\$ mode perturbations through the decomposition of the metric perturbations by singular harmonic functions at once and the regularization of this singularity through the imposition of the boundary conditions to the Einstein equations. Following this proposal, we derive the linearized Einstein equations for any modes of \$l\textbackslash geq 0\$ in a gauge-invariant manner. We discuss the solutions to the odd-mode perturbation equations in the linearized Einstein equations and show that these perturbations include the Kerr parameter perturbation in these odd-mode perturbation, which is physically reasonable.},

However, at the special point, both solutions are indeed regular. Moreover, the incoming mode cannot be uniquely defined at the special point due to these solutions.},

The absorption probability has the form P (l) = P0(l)fl({$\lambda$}), where P0(l) is the partial wave's absorption probability in the extremal case, and the thermal factor fl({$\lambda$}) depends on the ratio of the frequency of the incoming wave and the Hawking temperature, {$\lambda$} = {$\omega$}/{$\pi$}T . Using Langer-Olver's method, we obtain a low-temperature ({$\lambda$} {$\gg$} 1) asymptotic expansion for P (l) with coefficients determined recursively. This expansion, which turns out to be a fairly good approximation even for {$\lambda$} {$\sim$} 1, accounts for all power-like finite-temperature corrections to P0(l), and we calculate a few terms explicitly. We also show that at low temperature the absorption probability contains exponentially suppressed terms, and attempt to develop an approximation scheme to calculate those. The high-temperature expansion is also considered. For the s-wave, the low-temperature gravity result is consistent with the free finite-temperature field theory calculation, while for high temperature and higher partial waves we find a disagreement. As a check of the approximation methods used, we apply them to the D1 - D5-brane system, and compare results to the known exact solution.},

To obtain a manifold structure we consider a finer Whitney-type topology. This turns the unit component of the NU group into an infinite-dimensional Lie group. We then study the Lie theoretic properties of this group. Surprisingly, the group operations of the full NU group become discontinuous, whence the NU group does not support a Lie group structure. The NU group contains the Bondi\textendash Metzner\textendash Sachs (BMS) group as a subgroup, whose Lie group structure was constructed in a previous article. It is well known that the NU Lie algebra splits into a direct sum of Lie ideals of the Lie algebras of the BMS group and conformal rescalings of scri. However, the lack of a Lie group structure on the NU group implies that the BMS group cannot be embedded as a Lie subgroup therein.},

All members of the same family of isospectral Hamiltonians are unitarily equivalent, and the unitary transformations between them form a group isomorphic with the additive group of real numbers. The theory is generalized by including the parameter identifying a member of an isospectral family as a new variable. The unitary transformations within a family correspond to translations in the parameter space. The generator of infinitesimal translations represents a conserved quantity in the extended theory. Isometric operators are then applied to the development of models of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. In addition to the standard models based on the Darboux procedure, I show how to construct models based on the Abraham-Moses and Pursey procedures. The formalism shows that the Nieto ambiguity present in all models of supersymmetric quantum mechanics can be interpreted as a renormalization of the ground state of the supersymmetric system. This allows a generalization of supersymmetric quantum mechanics analogous to that developed for systems of isospectral Hamiltonians.},

It has recently received renewed interest in the context of the flat holography and the infrared structure of gravity. In this thesis, we investigate the consequences of considering extensions of the BMS group in four dimensions with superrotations. In particular, we apply the covariant phase space methods on a class of first order gauge theories that includes the Cartan formulation of general relativity and specify this analysis to gravity in asymptotically flat spacetime. Furthermore, we renormalize the symplectic structure at null infinity to obtain the generalized BMS charge algebra associated with smooth superrotations. We then study the vacuum structure of the gravitational field, which allows us to relate the so-called superboost transformations to the velocity kick/refraction memory effect. Afterward, we propose a new set of boundary conditions in asymptotically locally (A)dS spacetime that leads to a version of the BMS group in the presence of a non-vanishing cosmological constant, called the {$\Lambda$}BMS asymptotic symmetry group. Using the holographic renormalization procedure and a diffeomorphism between Bondi and Fefferman-Graham gauges, we construct the phase space of {$\Lambda$}-BMS and show that it reduces to the one of the generalized BMS group in the flat limit.},

  abstract = {A new method which allows one to study multiple coherent reflection/transmissions by partially transparent interfaces, (e.g., in multi-layer mesoscopic structures or grain boundaries in high-Tc's), in the framework of the quasiclassical theory of superconductivity is suggested. It is argued that in the presence of interfaces, a straight-line trajectory transforms to a simple connected 1-dimensional tree (graph) with knots, i.e. the points where the interface scattering events occur and pieces of the trajectories are coupled. For the 2-component trajectory ''wave function'' which factorizes the Gor'kov matrix Green's function, a linear boundary condition on the knot is formulated for an arbitrary interface, specular or diffusive (in the many channel model). From the new boundary condition, we derive: (i) the excitation scattering amplitude for the multi-channel Andreev/ordinary reflection/transmission processes; (ii) the boundary conditions for the Riccati equation; (iii) the transfer matrix which couples the trajectory Green's function before and after the interface scattering. To show the usage of the method, the cases of a film separated from a bulk superconductor by a partially transparent interface, and a SIS' sandwich with finite thickness layers, are considered. The electric current response to the vector potential (the superfluid density {$\rho$}s) with the {$\pi$} phase difference in S and S' is calculated for the sandwich. It is shown that the model is very sensitive to imperfection of the SS' interface: the low temperature response being paramagnetic ({$\rho$}s {$<$} 0 ) in the ideal system case, changes its sign and becomes diamagnetic ({$\rho$}s {$>$} 0) when the probability of reflection is as low as a few percent.},

Specifically, we mildly perturb a thermofield double state by adding a small number of quanta on one side. If these quanta are released a scrambling time in the past, they destroy the local two-sided correlations present in the unperturbed state. The corresponding bulk geometry is a two-sided AdS black hole, and the key effect is the blueshift of the early infalling quanta relative to the \$t = 0\$ slice, creating a shock wave. We comment on string- and Planck-scale corrections to this setup, and discuss points that may be relevant to the firewall controversy.},

  abstract = {Abstract: In [1] we gave a precise holographic calculation of chaos at the scrambling time scale. We studied the influence of a small perturbation, long in the past, on a two-sided correlation function in the thermofield double state. A similar analysis applies to squared commutators and other out-of-time-order one-sided correlators [2-6]. The essential bulk physics is a high energy scattering problem near the horizon of an AdS black hole. The above papers used Einstein gravity to study this problem; in the present paper we consider stringy and Planckian corrections. Elastic stringy corrections play an important role, effectively weakening and smearing out the development of chaos. We discuss their signature in the boundary field theory, commenting on the extension to weak coupling. Inelastic effects, although important for the evolution of the state, leave a parametrically small imprint on the correlators that we study. We briefly discuss ways to diagnose these small corrections, and we propose another correlator where inelastic effects are order one.},

The background space-time metric depends both on the in-states and on the out-states. We present some model calculations and extensive discussions. In particular, we show, in the context of a toy model, that the \$S\$-matrix describing soft particles in the hard particle background of a collapsing star is unitary, nevertheless, the spectrum of particles is shown to be approximately thermal.

For the case of dS3, which is analyzed in some detail, the central charge of the CFT2 is computed in an analysis of the asymptotic symmetry group at I{$\pm$}. This dS/CFT proposal is supported by the computation of correlation functions of a massive scalar field. In general the dual CFT may be non-unitary and (if for example there are sufficently massive stable scalars) contain complex conformal weights. We also consider the physical region O- of dS3 corresponding to the causal past of a timelike observer, whose holographic dual lives on a plane rather than a sphere. O- can be foliated by asymptotically flat spacelike slices. Time evolution along these slices is generated by L0 + L\textasciimacron 0, and is dual to scale transformations in the boundary CFT2.},

  abstract = {According to 't Hooft the combination of quantum mechanics and gravity requires the three dimensional world to be an image of data that can be stored on a two dimensional projection much like a holographic image. The two dimensional description only requires one discrete degree of freedom per Planck area and yet it is rich enough to describe all three dimensional phenomena. After outlining 't Hooft's proposal I give a preliminary informal description of how it may be implemented. One finds a basic requirement that particles must grow in size as their momenta are increased far above the Planck scale. The consequences for high energy particle collisions are described. The phenomena of particle growth with momentum was previously discussed in the context of string theory and was related to information spreading near black hole horizons. The considerations of this paper indicate that the effect is much more rapid at all but the earliest times. In fact the rate of spreading is found to saturate the bound from causality. Finally we consider string theory as a possible realization of 't Hooft's idea. The light front lattice string model of Klebanov and Susskind is reviewed and its similarities with the holographic theory are demonstrated. The agreement between the two requires unproven but plausible assumptions about the nonperturbative behavior of string theory. Very similar ideas to those in this paper have been long held by Charles Thorn.},

We access the many-body localized state using a standard fixed point Hamiltonian, and we show that operators exhibit slow logarithmic growth under time evolution. We compare the result with the expected growth of commutators in both localized and delocalized non-interacting disordered models.

To image and study this phenomenon, we have assembled the Event Horizon Telescope, a global very long baseline interferometry array observing at a wavelength of 1.3 mm. This allows us to reconstruct event-horizon-scale images of the supermassive black hole candidate in the center of the giant elliptical galaxy M87. We have resolved the central compact radio source as an asymmetric bright emission ring with a diameter of 42+/-3 micro-as, which is circular and encompasses a central depression in brightness with a flux ratio 10:1. The emission ring is recovered using different calibration and imaging schemes, with its diameter and width remaining stable over four different observations carried out in different days. Overall, the observed image is consistent with expectations for the shadow of a Kerr black hole as predicted by general relativity. The asymmetry in brightness in the ring can be explained in terms of relativistic beaming of the emission from a plasma rotating close to the speed of light around a black hole. We compare our images to an extensive library of ray-traced general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of black holes and derive a central mass of M = (6.5+/-0.7) x 10\^9 Msun. Our radio-wave observations thus provide powerful evidence for the presence of supermassive black holes in centers of galaxies and as the central engines of active galactic nuclei. They also present a new tool to explore gravity in its most extreme limit and on a mass scale that was so far not accessible.},

In the source frame, the initial black hole masses are \$36\^\{+5\}\_\{-4\} M\_\o dot\$ and \$29\^\{+4\}\_\{-4\} M\_\o dot\$, and the final black hole mass is \$62\^\{+4\}\_\{-4\} M\_\o dot\$, with \$3.0\^\{+0.5\}\_\{-0.5\} M\_\o dot c\^2\$ radiated in gravitational waves. All uncertainties define 90\% credible intervals.These observations demonstrate the existence of binary stellar-mass black hole systems. This is the first direct detection of gravitational waves and the first observation of a binary black hole merger.},

  abstract = {The open question of whether a Kerr black hole can become tidally deformed or not has profound implications for fundamental physics and gravitational-wave astronomy. We consider a Kerr black hole embedded in a weak and slowly varying, but otherwise arbitrary, multipolar tidal environment. By solving the static Teukolsky equation for the gauge-invariant Weyl scalar {$\psi$}0, and by reconstructing the corresponding metric perturbation in an ingoing radiation gauge, for a general harmonic index {$\mathscr{l}$}, we compute the linear response of a Kerr black hole to the tidal field. This linear response vanishes identically for a Schwarzschild black hole and for an axisymmetric perturbation of a spinning black hole. For a nonaxisymmetric perturbation of a spinning black hole, however, the linear response does not vanish, and it contributes to the Geroch-Hansen multipole moments of the perturbed Kerr geometry. As an application, we compute explicitly the rotational black hole tidal Love numbers that couple the induced quadrupole moments to the quadrupolar tidal fields, to linear order in the black hole spin, and we introduce the corresponding notion of tidal Love tensor. Finally, we show that those induced quadrupole moments are closely related to the well-known physical phenomenon of tidal torquing of a spinning body interacting with a tidal gravitational environment.},

The stability of these objects, which has been discussed in a recent report1, ensures their continued existence after formation. Inasmuch as the infinite redshift associated with it and its behaviour as a one-way membrane make the Schwarzschild horizon at once elusive and intriguing, it is important to explore theoretically all possible modes in which the presence of such a black-hole manifests itself. In what follows, we present a partial summary of some results obtained from an investigation of the scattering of gravitational waves by a Schwarzschild horizon. \textcopyright{} 1970 Nature Publishing Group.},

The perturbations superposed on the Schwarzschild background metric are the same as those given by Regge and Wheeler, consisting of odd- and even-parity classes, and with the time dependence exp(-ikt), where k is the frequency. An analysis of the Einstein field equations computed to first order in the perturbations away from the Schwarzschild background metric shows that when the frequency is made purely imaginary, the solutions that vanish at large values of r, conforming to the requirement of asymptotic flatness, will diverge near the Schwarzschild surface in the Kruskal coordinates. Since the background metric itself is finite at this surface, the above behavior of the perturbation clearly contradicts the basic assumption that the perturbations are small compared to the background metric. Thus perturbations with imaginary frequencies that grow exponentially with time are physically unacceptable, and hence the metric is stable. Perturbations with real values of k representing gravitational waves are also examined. It is shown that the only nontrivial stationary perturbation that can exist is one that is due to the rotation of the source, which is given by the odd perturbation with the angular momentum l=1. The significance of solutions with complex frequencies is pointed out, as is the lack of a theorem (completeness of the eigenfunction) for the even-parity case to parallel the Sturm-Liouville theory, which is applicable to the odd-parity case. Such a theorem would be required to convert the computations indicating stability as given here into a fully rigorous stability theorem. \textcopyright{} 1970 The American Physical Society.},

Defining a weight to organize the bulk equations of motion, a set of general pole-skipping conditions are derived. In particular, the frequencies simply follow from general covariance and weight matching. In the presence of higher spin fields, we find that the imaginary frequency for the highest-weight pole-skipping point equals the higher-spin Lyapunov exponent which lies outside of the chaos bound. Without higher spin fields, we show that the energy density Green's function has its highest-weight pole skipping happening at a location related to the OTOC for arbitrary higher-derivative gravity, with a Lyapunov exponent saturating the chaos bound and a butterfly velocity matching that extracted from a shockwave calculation. We also suggest an explanation for this matching at the metric level by obtaining the on-shell shockwave solution from a regularized limit of the metric perturbation at the skipped pole.},

In particular, we discuss the absolutely crucial property of \{\textbackslash em isospectrality\} of the aforementioned transformations which guarantees that the quasinormal mode (QNM) spectra of potentials, related via the transformation, completely coincide. We demonstrate that, while the first two types of the Darboux transformations (DT and BDT) are indeed isospectral, the situation is wildly different for the GDT: it violates the isospectrality requirement and is therefore only valid for the solutions with just one fixed frequency. Furthermore, it is shown that although in this case the GDT does provide a relationship between two arbitrary potentials (a short-ranged and a long-ranged potentials relationship being just a trivial example), this relationship ends up being completely formal. Finally, we consider frequency-dependent potentials. A new generalization of the Darboux transformation is constructed for them and it is proven (on a concrete example) that such transformations are also not isospectral. In short, we demonstrate how a little, almost incorporeal flaw may become a major problem for an otherwise perfectly admirable goal of mathematical generalization.},

We have examined the problem in the approximation of linear perturbations from a Schwarzschild background geometry, utilizing the decomposition into the tensor spherical harmonics given by Regge and Wheeler (1957) and by Mathews (1962). The falling particle contributes a {$\delta$}-function source term (geodesic motion in the background Schwarzschild geometry) which is also decomposed into tensor harmonics, each of which "drives" the corresponding perturbation harmonic.

In this section we investigate the fitness $f_1$ on \algGlobalSemoAlt.
We will prove that the algorithm finds an optimal $W$-separator in expectation in FPT-runtime with the parameters $\opt$ and $W$.
Recall that the parameter $k$ in the decision variant of the $W$-separator asks for a $W$-separator of size at most $k$.
A more general variant, known as \textit{weighted component order connectivity problem}, was studied in~\cite{DBLP:journals/algorithmica/DrangeDH16} by Drange et al.
They achieve a $\O(k^2 W + W^2 k)$ vertex-kernel, which also holds for the $W$-separator problem.

\begin{theorem}[\cite{DBLP:journals/algorithmica/DrangeDH16}, Theorem~15]
	\label{thm::degreeKernel}
	The $W$-separator admits a kernel with at most $kW(k+W)+k$ vertices, where $k$ is the solution size.
\end{theorem}

Essentially, they use the following \emph{reduction rule}: as long as there is a vertex with degree greater than $k + W$, the vertex is included in the solution set and may be removed from the instance.

It is not difficult to see that this vertex must be included in the solution, since otherwise we would have to take more than $k$ vertices from its neighborhood to get a feasible solution.
After using this reduction rule exhaustively each vertex in the reduced instance has degree at most $k+W$.
Consequently, in the reduced instance, each vertex of a $W$-separator is connected to at most $k+W$ connected components after its removal, where each of those components has size at most $W$.  
A simple calculation provides finally the vertex-kernel stated in \cref{thm::degreeKernel}.

Now, we make use of the degree-objective from $f_1$ to find a search point that selects those vertices which can be safely added to an optimal solution according to the reduction rule.

\begin{lemma}
	\label{lemma::reducedInstance_f1}
	Using the fitness function $f_1$, the expected number of iterations of %\algGlobalSemo or
	\algGlobalSemoAlt where the population $\P$ contains a solution $X$ in which for all $u \in u(X)$ and for all $v \in X_1$ we have $d(u) \leq \opt+W$ and $d(v) > \opt+W$ is bounded by $\O(n^3(\opt + \log n))$. 
\end{lemma}

With \cref{lemma::reducedInstance_f1} in hand we can upper bound the expected number of iterations that \algGlobalSemoAlt takes to find an optimal $W$-separator with respect to the fitness $f_1$.
Note that the uncovered-objective of $f_1$ ensures that the algorithms \algGlobalSemoAlt converge to a feasible solution and that a search point $X$ with $f_1(X) = (\opt, 0, *)$ corresponds to an optimal $W$-separator.   

\begin{theorem}
	\label{thm::fitness1Opt}
	Using the fitness function $f_1$, the expected number of iterations of \algGlobalSemoAlt until it finds a minimum $W$-separator in $G=(V,E)$ is upper bounded by $\O\left(n^3(\opt + \log n) + n^2 \cdot 2^q \right)$, where $q=\opt \cdot W(\opt+W)+\opt$.
\end{theorem}

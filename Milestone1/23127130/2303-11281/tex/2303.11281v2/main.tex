		Parameterized analysis provides powerful mechanisms for obtaining fine-grained insights into different types of algorithms.
		In this work, we combine this field with evolutionary algorithms and provide parameterized complexity analysis of evolutionary multi-objective algorithms for the $W$-separator problem, which is a natural generalization of the vertex cover problem.
		The goal is to  remove  the  minimum  number of  vertices such  that  each  connected component in the resulting graph has at most $W$ vertices.
		We provide different multi-objective formulations involving two or three objectives that provably lead to fixed-parameter evolutionary algorithms with respect to the value of an optimal solution $OPT$ and $W$.
		Of particular interest are kernelizations and the reducible structures used for them.
		We show that in expectation the algorithms make incremental progress in finding such structures and beyond.
		The current best known kernelization of the $W$-separator uses linear programming methods and requires a non-trivial post-process to extract the reducible structures.
		We provide additional structural features to show that evolutionary algorithms with appropriate objectives are also capable of extracting them.
		Our results show that evolutionary algorithms with different objectives guide the search and admit fixed parameterized runtimes to solve or approximate (even arbitrarily close) the $W$-separator problem.

	\section{Conclusion}
	
	In this work, we studied the behavior of evolutionary algorithms with different multi-objective fitness functions for the $W$-separator problem from the perspective of parameterized complexity.
	More precisely, we investigated the running time of such evolutionary algorithms depending on the problem parameter $\opt + W$.
	Our analysis was based on properties of reducible structures, showing that, given a suitable fitness function, the evolutionary algorithm tends to reduce the given instance along these structures.
	Once this is done, the running time for either obtaining an arbitrarily close approximation or an exact solution is tractable with respect to the problem parameter.
	In particular, this shows that evolutionary algorithms solve the $W$-separator problem in expectation in FPT-time for the parameter $\opt + W$.

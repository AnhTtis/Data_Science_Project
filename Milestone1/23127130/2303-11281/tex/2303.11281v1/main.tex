% Parameterized analysis of algorithms~\cite{downey2012parameterized} provides a way of understanding the working behaviour of algorithms via their dependence on important structural parameters for NP-hard problems. This technique of fine-grained analysis allows for insights into which parameters make a problem hard. When analyzing heuristic search methods such as evolutionary algorithms, a parameterized runtime analysis allows for runtime bounds not just dependent on the given input size but also in terms of parameters that measure the difficulty of the problem. 
%
% Parameterized analysis of evolutionary algorithms has been carried out for several important combinatorial optimization problems (see \cite{DBLP:series/ncs/0001S20} for an overview). 
% The first analysis was for the classical vertex cover problem~\cite{DBLP:journals/algorithmica/KratschN13} which is the prime problem in the area of parameterized complexity.
% Following that, problems such as the maximum leaf spanning problem~\cite{DBLP:conf/ppsn/KratschLNO10} and parameterized settings of 
% makespan scheduling~\cite{DBLP:conf/ppsn/SuttonN12} were considered. More recently, both the closest string problems~\cite{DBLP:journals/algorithmica/Sutton21} and
% jump and repair operators have been analyzed in the parameterized setting~\cite{DBLP:conf/foga/BransonS21}.
%
%A crucial aspect of the parameterized analysis of evolutionary algorithms (and algorithms in general) is the ability of the considered approaches to obtain a kenerlization for the considered problems. A kernel here refers to a smaller sub-problem whose size is polynomially bounded in the size of the given parameter(s). As the size is bounded, brute-force methods or random sampling can then be applied to obtain an optimal solution. 
%
%In this paper, we extend the results obtained in \cite{DBLP:journals/algorithmica/KratschN13} for the vertex cover problem to the more general $W$-separator problem.
%%This work can be seen as an extension of the results from \cite{DBLP:journals/algorithmica/KratschN13} for the vertex cover problem to the more general $W$-separator problem.

%The approaches considered in \cite{DBLP:journals/algorithmica/KratschN13} obtain a kernelzation for the vertex cover problem enabled through the multi-objective formulations of the problem.

    \section{Conclusion}
    
    In this work, we studied the behavior of evolutionary algorithms with different multi-objective fitness functions for the $W$-separator problem from the perspective of parameterized complexity.
    More precisely, we investigated the running time of such evolutionary algorithms depending on the problem parameter $\opt + W$.
    Our analysis was based on properties of reducible structures, showing that, given a suitable fitness function, the evolutionary algorithm tends to reduce the given instance along these structures.
    Once this is done, the running time for either obtaining an arbitrarily close approximation or an exact solution is tractable with respect to the problem parameter.
    In particular, this shows that evolutionary algorithms solve the $W$-separator problem in expectation in FPT-time for the parameter $\opt + W$.

    % In this work, we combine problem-independent evolutionary algorithms with parameterized complexity and study the W-separator problem parameterized by $\opt+W$.
    % It is already complexity-wise hard to find good approximation for this problem (see literature review).
    %The problem is a natural generalization of the well-known vertex cover problem and 
    % to find good approximations for it is already complexity-wise hard (see literature review).
    %By using structural properties of reducible structures of the %$W$-separator, we have shown that the algorithms tend to reduce first instances by them.
    %Knowing that the algorithms reach this milestone, it was possible to prove that the algorithms achieve tractable run times with respect to the parameters for exact solutions and arbitrarily close approximations.

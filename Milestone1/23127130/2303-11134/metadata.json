    "abstract": "Since the lensing effects play a vital role in modern cosmology. A new framework is developed for the static spherically symmetrical wormhole (WH) in terms of the radial equation of state (REoS). Following the standard procedure, we calculate the lensing equation, magnification, and event rate according to REoS, where our analysis indicates that the image problem of light source is complicated. As for the event rate, our investigations indicate that the larger values for the throat radius of WH and REoS will lead to larger values of the event rate. Compared with the event rate of blackhole, it is also claimed that the value of WH will be larger, in which their mass and the distance of them (blackhole or WH) between the light source and observer are comparable. Thus, our study could provide a possibility for distinguishing the WH and blackhole under similar circumstances.",

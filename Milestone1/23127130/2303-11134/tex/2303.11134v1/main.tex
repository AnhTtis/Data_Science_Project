\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we develop a framework to re-examine the weak lensing (including the microlensing) effects of the static spherical symmetric wormhole in terms of the radial equation of state $\eta=\frac{p_r}{\rho}$ (REoS). As for its application, we calculate its magnification, and event rate under this REoS, in which we show that the maximal value of magnification of the Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole is only related to the relative position and intrinsic angle, whose the maximal value is around five. For the event rate, our results indicate that one cannot distinguish the Eillis-Bronnikov wormhole and charged wormhole, but its order is much higher than the vacuum case, in which all these metrics belong to the static spherical symmetric wormhole metric. By calculating the lensing equation of the static spherical symmetric wormhole,	we find an explicit formula between the maximal number of images of the wormhole and $\eta$. It shows that this relation is consistent with the classical wormhole, but the case for wormhole with quantum corrections is still mysterious.  Our new method may shed new light on distinguishing the wormhole and blackhole via the event rate.

\section{Introduction}
\label{introduction}


Wormhole has been proposed more than one hundred years. In 1916, Flamm studied the internal structure of Schwarzschild’s solution \cite{Flamm:1916}. Einstein and Rosen proposed the concept of a bridge structure, which paved the way for further understanding of wormholes \cite{Einstein:1935}. The wormhole was first introduced by Misner and Wheeler \cite{Misner:1957}. Ellis proposed the idea of a drain hole structure \cite{Ellis:1973}. Then, Morris proposed the concept of a traversable wormhole \cite{Morris:1988cz}, in which a type of wormhole that could be traversed by humans or spaceships without being destroyed. These advancements in the understanding of wormholes have contributed greatly to the field of theoretical physics. Thereafter, wormholes became the subject of extensive research \cite{Damour:2007ap,Kim:2003zb,Bueno:2017hyj,Visser:1989kh,Sushkov:2005kj,Bronnikov:2002rn,Clement:1995ya,Richarte:2017iit,Ayuso:2020vuu,KordZangeneh:2020ixt,Song:2023jdn,Saleem:2023lul,Eid:2023wrd,Godani:2023paj} by physicists. The study of wormholes typically begins with an assumption about their geometric structure and then involves calculating the corresponding material source required to create such a structure. However, such calculations often violate known energy conditions \cite{Hochberg:1998ii,Hochberg:1998ha,Lobo:2002zf,Lobo:2004rp}, indicating that some exotic matter is required to explain the existence of wormholes. The study of wormholes can deepen our understanding of general relativity and explore space.

As for the lensing effects, Einstein published the first article on gravitational lens field \cite{Einstein:1936llh}. After a period of silence, gravitational lens has become a hotspot. Gravitational lensing can be classified into two types: weak gravitational lensing including the microlensing \cite{Bartelmann:1999yn,Kaiser:1991qi} and strong gravitational lensing \cite{Bozza:2002zj,Virbhadra:1999nm}. Weak gravitational lensing is caused by relatively small perturbations in the gravitational field and results in slight distortions of images, while strong gravitational lensing involves more significant deformations due to the presence of massive objects like black holes, galaxies or galaxy clusters. Gravitational microlens is an effective method to explore wormholes \cite{Perlick:2004tq,SDSS:2002oin}. In the literature, The microlensing effect of a wormhole is extensively studied \cite{Gao:2022cds,Liu:2022lfb,Sokoliuk:2022owk,Zatrimaylov:2021ijd,Cheng:2021hoc,Li:2019qyb,Kuniyasu:2018cgv,Raidal:2018eoo,Tsukamoto:2017hva,Sajadi:2016hko,Lukmanova:2016czn,Tsukamoto:2016zdu,Kitamura:2016vad,Kitamura:2012zy,Kitamura:2012wcg,Toki:2011zu,Abe:2010ap,Bogdanov:2008zy,Torres:2001gb,Safonova:2001vz,Torres:1998cu,Torres:1998xd}. An interesting question arises as to how many images a light source will generate at the equatorial plane when passing through the wormhole space-time, and what this quantity is related to. There has been some discussions about microlensing imaging in wormholes spacetime \cite{Kitamura:2016vad,Kuniyasu:2018cgv,Abe:2010ap,Liu:2022lfb}. 

In this paper, we will re-examine this problem from a new perspective by implementing the REoS to depict the lensing effects of the spherically symmetric wormhole metric. Then we calculate the deflection angle of this metric by Gauss-Bonnet Theorem (GBT) \cite{Gibbons:2008rj,Gibbons:2008zi,Werner:2012rc} which is widely used in gravitational lenses to calculate deflection angle \cite{He:2023hsv,Upadhyay:2023yhk,Javed:2023iih,Javed:2022gtz,Huang:2022soh,He:2022yhp,Gao:2023ltr,Cai:2023ite,Ovgun:2023ego}, and we find that the state coefficient $\eta$ determines the maximum value of the image of a light source in the equatorial plane. In the last section, we discuss the applicability of the image number formula $n=2+\frac{1}{\eta}$. We also calculate the magnification, and get a general formula for magnification. We analyze the magnification of Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole as an instance, and detect that it has a maximum value which only depends on the relative position $\frac{D_{LS}}{D_{S}}$ and intrinsic angle $\beta$ in the first-order lens equation case. In addition, we study the event rate of a large scale wormhole. We regard it as an object with continuous mass distribution, and obtain the relationship between the event rate and the radial state coefficient.  Our work may bring new ideas to the study of wormholes. 

The structure of our article is organized as follows: In section \ref{wormhole}, we use REoS to construct a metric. Section \ref{microlensing}, we use the gravitational lens technology to calculate the deflection angle and lens equation and obtain a formula for the number of images. Besides, magnification and event rate are also discussed. In Section \ref{number of images}, we discuss the applicability of the formula in specific examples. In section \ref{conclusion and outlook}, we draw our conclusion and outlook. In appendix \ref{appendix}, we unify all of the parameters in SI unit. 



\section{Wormhole}
\label{wormhole}
In this section, we follow the notation of \cite{Lobo:2005us, Lobo:2005yv, Garattini:2007ff}. By starting with a static spherical symmetry metric:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq1}
ds^2=-e^{2\Phi}dt^2+\frac{dr^2}{1-b(r)/r}+r^2d\Omega^2,
\end{equation}
this metric describes a generic  static and spherical wormhole metric. The Einstein field equation provides the following relationships:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq2}
p_r^\prime=\frac{2}{r}\big(p_t-p_r\big)-\big(\rho+p_r\big)\Phi^\prime,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq3}
b^\prime=8\pi G\rho(r)r^2,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq4}
\Phi^\prime=\frac{b+8\pi Gp_rr^3}{2r^2\big(1-b(r)/r\big)},
\end{equation}
where the prime denotes a derivative with respect to the radial coordinate $r$, $p_r$ represents the radial pressure, $p_t$ indicates the tangential pressure, and $\rho$ is the energy density. REoS is defined as follows,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq5}
p_r=\eta \rho.
\end{equation}
where $\eta$ represents radial state coefficeient. The flaring-out condition and asymptotic flatness take the neccessary condition,
\begin{equation}
\eta>0 \,\, \text{and} \,\, \eta<-1.
\label{flaring out condition}
\end{equation}
Combining these equations \eqref{eq2}-\eqref{eq5}, we can get
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
b(r) = r_0\bigg(\frac{r_0}{r}\bigg)^\frac{1}{\eta}e^{-(2/\eta)[\Phi(r)-\Phi(r_0)]}\times
\\
\bigg[\frac{2}{\eta} \int_{r_0}^r\big(\frac{r}{r_0}\big)^{(1+\eta)/\eta}\Phi^\prime(r)
e^{(2/\eta)[\Phi(r)-\Phi(r_0)]}dr+1\bigg].
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
We choose a domain in which $\Phi(r)\approx constant$, then,
\begin{equation}
b(r)=r_0\bigg(\frac{r_0}{r}\bigg)^{\frac{1}{\eta}}.
\end{equation}
Substitute the above formula into Eq. \eqref{eq1}, then one can get 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq7}
ds^2=-Adt^2+\frac{dr^2}{1-\big(r_0/r\big)^{1+\frac{1}{\eta}}}+r^2d\Omega^2,
\end{equation}
where $A=-e^{2\Phi}$. In the next section, we will use this metric to discuss microlensing effect.





\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.9]{wormhole_image_1.png}
    \caption{A sketch of a wormhole. In our case, we consider the lensing effects occur on one side of wormhole (spacetime 1 or spacetime 2). }
    \label{fig:my_label}
\end{figure}





\section{Microlensing}
\label{microlensing}
In this section, we will calculate the magnification and the event rate of metric \eqref{eq7}. Under REoS,  we also find an explicit relation between the maximal number of images of wormhole and $\eta$. 






\subsection{Deflection angle}
In this subsection, we will implement GBT to calculate the deflection angle. 
For a photon $ds^2=0$, it (in equatorial plane) will satisfy the following relation as 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq 8}
dt^2=\frac{dr^2}{A\left(1-\big(r_0/r\big)^{1+\frac{1}{\eta}}\right)}+\frac{r^2}{A}d\phi^2.
\end{equation}
Then we define two auxiliary quantities as $du=\frac{dr}{\sqrt{A\big(1-\big(r_0/r\big)^{1+\frac{1}{\eta}}\big)}}$ and $\xi=\frac{r}{\sqrt{A}}$. Gaussian optical curvature can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
K=\frac{-1}{\xi(u)}[\frac{dr}{du}\frac{d}{dr}\big(\frac{dr}{du}\big)\frac{d\xi}{dr}+\big(\frac{dr}{du}\big)^2\frac{d^2\xi}{dr^2}],
\end{equation}
combine with metric \eqref{eq 8}, one can get
\begin{equation}
\label{eq10}
K=\frac{-\sqrt{A}r_0\big(\frac{r_0}{r}\big)^\frac{1}{\eta}\big(1+\frac{1}{\eta}\big)}{2r^3\sqrt{1-\big(\frac{r_0}{r}\big)^{1+\frac{1}{\eta}}}}.
\end{equation}
Now let's derive the expression of deflection angle.
We first give the Gauss-Bonnet theorem
\begin{equation}
\int\int_D KdS+\int_{\partial D}\kappa dt+\sum\limits_i\alpha_i=2\pi\chi(D).
\end{equation}
We choose the integral domain $D$ in Fig. \ref{fig:1},  $OS$ is the geodesic line, so the line integral on $OS$ is zero. Besides, this
Euler index $\chi$ in domain $D$ is 1.
\begin{equation}
\int\int_{D_2}KdS+\int_{\gamma_P}\kappa dt+\sum_i\alpha_i=2\pi
\end{equation}
We can choose $\gamma$ to vertically intersect the geodesic line $OS$ at point O and point S, which means
\begin{equation}
\sum_i\alpha_i=\frac{\pi}{2}(S)+\frac{\pi}{2}(O)=\pi.
\end{equation}
The sum of external angles here is the sum of two right angles, And then we do an integral transformation
\begin{equation}
\kappa dt=\kappa\frac{dt}{d\phi}d\phi.
\end{equation}
Here $\phi$ is the angular coordinate of the center at $wormhole$. It can be done to set up $\kappa\frac{dt}{d\phi}=1$ on $\gamma$, so there is
\begin{equation}
\int\int_{D_2}KdS+\int_{\phi_O}^{\phi_S}d\phi+\pi=2\pi.
\end{equation}
Geodesic $OS$ is approximately a straight line, that is, the angle that $OS$ spans is $\pi+\alpha$, and we let the angular coordinate of point O be 0. The result is
\begin{equation}
\int\int_{D_2}KdS+\int_{0}^{\pi+\alpha}d\phi+\pi=\int\int_{D_2}KdS+\pi+\alpha+\pi=2\pi.
\end{equation}
The final result is
\begin{equation}
\alpha=-\int\int_{D_2}KdS.
\end{equation}
That is to say, our deflection angle can be written as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq11}
\alpha=-\int_0^\pi\int_{\frac{b}{\sin\phi}}^\infty K\sqrt{\det  h_{ab}} drd\phi,
\end{equation}
where $b$ is impact parameter and $h_{ab}$ is metric \eqref{eq 8}. Note that our results only apply to small angles. Substitute formula \eqref{eq10} to \eqref{eq11}, one can obtain
\begin{equation}
\label{eq 22}
\alpha=\int_0^\pi\int_{\frac{b}{\sin\phi}}^\infty\frac{r_0\big(\frac{r_0}{r}\big)^\frac{1}{\eta}\big(1+\frac{1}{\eta}\big)}{2\sqrt{A}r^2\big(1-\big(\frac{r_0}{r}\big)^{1+\frac{1}{\eta}}\big)}drd\phi.
\end{equation}
Under the weak field approximation, we work out
\begin{equation}
\label{eq13}
\alpha=\frac{\sqrt{\pi}\big(\frac{r_0}{b}\big)^{1+\frac{1}{\eta}}\eta\Gamma[1+\frac{1}{2\eta}]}{2\sqrt{A}\Gamma[\frac{1}{2}\big(3+\frac{1}{\eta}\big)]}, ~~~\text{if } \frac{1}{\eta}>-2.
\end{equation}
This deflection angle is valid for the first order of $r_0/b$. Being armed with deflection angle \eqref{eq13}, one can investigate its corresponding lens equation. 





\subsection{Lensing equation}
Plane geometry in equatorial plane of lens Fig. \ref{fig:2} tells us
\begin{equation}
\label{eq14}
\beta=\theta-\frac{D_{LS}}{D_S}\alpha.
\end{equation}
Substitute Eq. \eqref{eq13} to Eq. \eqref{eq14}, one can obtain that
\begin{equation}
\theta^{2+\frac{1}{\eta}}-\beta\theta^{1+\frac{1}{\eta}}-\frac{D_{LS}}{D_S}\frac{\sqrt{\pi}\big(\frac{r_0}{D_L}\big)^{1+\frac{1}{\eta}}\eta\Gamma[1+\frac{1}{2\eta}]}{2\sqrt{A}\Gamma[\frac{1}{3}\big(3+\frac{1}{\eta}\big)]}=0,
\label{general lens eq}
\end{equation}
here we have used the approximation $b\approx\theta D_L$. According to eq. \eqref{general lens eq}, one can explicitly obtain the relation between the order of lensing equation (n) and $\eta$, 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq 16}
n=2+\frac{1}{\eta}.
\end{equation}
This is an equation about the number of images (If there are at most n solutions on the inference of the n order of equation). When $\eta\rightarrow 0_+$, then $n\rightarrow\infty$, this means that we can at most get an infinite number of images. On the other hand, when $\eta\rightarrow\pm\infty$, had $n\rightarrow 2$, we are expected to have two images. 
 
 From the perspective of observation, only the real solution is applicable. However, the second order of the lensing equation could have complex solutions. The situation of the higher order lensing equation is more complicated. To be more precise, one cannot find the exact real solution of the higher-order lensing equation. Thus, the image number equation will be guiding us to explore the image problems in various wormholes.

    \caption{Showing lens plane geometry. $I$ is the location of images, $S$ is location of source, $\alpha$ is the deflection angle, $W$ is the  wormhole and $b$ is the impact parameter. $\alpha$ is the deflection angle. All of these angles are much less than unity.}
    \label{fig:2}
\end{figure}








\subsection{Magnification}
Magnification is a result of the distortion caused by lensing. By applying the lens equation, the solid angle element $d\beta^2$ is transformed into the solid angle $d\theta^2$, ultimately affecting the observed solid angle under which the source is viewed. This shift in solid angle results in a magnification or demagnification of the received flux. The total magnification can be calculated as follows:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq 27}
\mu_{\rm total}=\sum_i \big|\frac{\beta}{\theta_i}\frac{d\beta}{d\theta_i}\big|^{-1}.
\end{equation}
substituting eq \eqref{eq14} into eq \eqref{eq 27}, which leads to
\begin{equation}
\mu_{\rm total}=\sum_i\big|\big(2+\frac{1}{\eta}\big)\frac{\beta}{\theta_i}-\big(1+\frac{1}{\eta}\big)\frac{\beta^2}{\theta^2_i}
\big|^{-1},
\label{total mag}
\end{equation}
where $\theta_i$ is the angle of $i-th$ image of wormhole. Eq. \eqref{total mag} is a general formula for calculating the magnification. We calculate the Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole as an example. For simplicity, one can use the $b\approx \theta D_L$ into the total magnification \eqref{total mag} with $\eta=1$. Consequently, one can get 
\begin{equation}
\mu=\big|\frac{3\beta}{\beta+\frac{D_{LS}}{D_S}\frac{\pi}{4}\big(\frac{r_0}{b}\big)^2}-\frac{2\beta^2}{\big(\beta+\frac{D_{LS}}{D_S}\frac{\pi}{4}\big(\frac{r_0}{b}\big)^2\big)^2}\big|^{-1}.
\end{equation}
We plot the magnification of Ellis-Bronnikov wormhol in Fig. \ref{fig:my_label 4}. It clearly shows that the magnification will be increased as enhancing $b$, where $r_0$ is fixed. This means that the more closely the photon trajectory is to the wormhole's throat, the more distorted the light can be, the greater magnification. Then there is an maximum value for this magnification, which depends on the relative position $\frac{D_{LS}}{D_S}$ and the intrinsic angle $\beta$, and the maximum value in our case is $4.92992\approx 5$. 



\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=1.1]{magnification.png}
    \caption{The magnification of Ellis wormhole.  As $b\to r_0$, $\frac{D_{LS}}{D_S}=\frac{1}{2}$ and $\beta=0.03$, it shows that $\mu=5$.}
    \label{fig:my_label 4}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Event rate}
The event rate of Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole has been studied by F.Abe \cite{Abe:2010ap}, which he discussed that wormholes of a throat $10\sim 10^{11}$ km are uniformly distributed in the universe, and he also calculated the corresponding optic depth and event rate. We adopt different assumptions: the throat of wormholes are quite large $r_0=10^{20}$ m and wormholes evenly distributed in the universe. We study a wormhole ($n=1$) which is regarded as an object with continuous mass distribution, and its event rate.
The effective mass of wormholes can be calculated as follows
\begin{equation}
M=\frac{r_0}{2}+\int_{r_0}^r4\pi\rho(r^\prime)r^{\prime 2}dr^\prime,
\end{equation}
where the energy density is
\begin{equation}
\rho=-\frac{Ar_0(\frac{r_0}{r})^{\frac{1}{\eta}}}{r^3\eta}\frac{c^4}{8\pi G}.
\end{equation}
Therefore,
\begin{equation}
M=\frac{Ac^4 D_L\big(\frac{r_0}{D_L}\big)^{1+\frac{1}{\eta}}}{2G}+\frac{r_0G-Ac^4}{2G}.
\end{equation}
There is a famous parameter in the field of gravitational lens---Einstein angle:
\begin{equation}
\theta_E\equiv \sqrt{\frac{4GM}{c^2}\frac{D_{LS}}{D_LD_S}},
\end{equation}
and Einstein ring is generally assumed to be the cross-section for microlensing
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{micro}=\pi\theta^2_E.
\end{equation}
This is the solid angle within which a source has to be placed in order to produce a detectable microlensing signal.
The Einstein radius crossing time is
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
t_E&=\frac{D_L\theta_E}{v}\\
&=\sqrt{\frac{2\big(Ac^4D_L\big(\frac{r_0}{D_L}\big)^{1+\frac{1}{\eta}}+r_0G-Ac^4\big)}{c^2v^2}\frac{D_{LS}D_L}{D_S}},
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $v$ is the speed of the observed object.
The optical depth $\tau$ to some distance $D_S$ is the probability that a source at that distance gives rise to a detectable microlensing event . For
\begin{equation}
\tau(D_S)=\frac{4\pi G}{c^2}D_S^2\int_0^1\rho(x)x(1-x)dx,
\end{equation}
where $x=\frac{D_L}{D_S}, dx=\frac{dD_L}{D_S}$, the integral results is
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
&\tau(D_S)=|\frac{Ac^2r_0\big(\frac{r_0}{D_L}\big)^\frac{1}{\eta}(D_L(1+\eta)-D_S)}{2D_SD_L(1+\eta)}
\\
&-\frac{Ac^2(r_0(1+\eta)-D_S)}{2D_S(1+\eta)}|.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
To know the rate of microlensing events
we may observe while monitoring a certain number of sources for a specific time, then we could represent the event rate as 
\begin{equation}
\Gamma=\frac{d(N\tau)}{dt}=\frac{2N}{\pi}\int_0^{D_S}n(D_L)\frac{\pi r_E^2}{t_E}dD_L,
\end{equation}
Assuming the Einstein crossing times to all subject are identical, the result is
\begin{equation}
\Gamma=\frac{2N}{\pi t_E}\tau.
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
&\Gamma=\frac{2N}{\pi\sqrt{\frac{2\big(Ac^4D_L\big(\frac{r_0}{D_L}\big)^{1+\frac{1}{\eta}}+r_0G-Ac^4\big)}{c^2v^2}\frac{D_{LS}D_L}{D_S}}}\times
\\
&|\frac{Ac^2r_0\big(\frac{r_0}{D_L}\big)^\frac{1}{\eta}\big(D_L(1+\eta)-D_S\big)}{2D_SD_L(1+\eta)}-\frac{Ac^2\big(r_0(1+\eta)-D_S\big)}{2D_S(1+\eta)}|.
\end{aligned}
\label{event rate}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=1.2]{event_rate_0.png}
    \caption{Event rate \eqref{event rate} varies with $\eta$ whose range covers from $9$ to $10$. As $\eta<2$, $\Gamma$ will nearly be divergent. }
    \label{fig:my_label 1}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=1.2]{event_rate_1.png}
    \caption{Event rate \eqref{event rate} varies with $\eta$ whose range is from $-10$ to $-1$. $\eta=-1$ corresponds to the vacuum case (will show in \ref{number of images}).}
    \label{fig:my_label 2}
\end{figure}
We draw a graph of event rate and $\eta$ as Fig. \ref{fig:my_label 1} and Fig. \ref{fig:my_label 2}.
We find that the event rate in interval $0<\eta<1$ is divergent because at this interval we have get $n\to \infty$, which is restricted by the flaring-out condition \eqref{flaring out condition}, and every image can be observed microlensing events. 
Take Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole ($\eta=1$) as an instance, we can observe about $9\times 10^4$ microlensing events in one year for $1\times10^6$ sources. If in vacuum ($\eta=-1$), we can observe about 300 times a year. We find that Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole ($\eta=1$ will show in Sec. \ref{number of images}) will make the event rate much higher than vacuum. In addition, if two wormholes have the same $\eta$ value, we cannot distinguish them by event rate. Because the event rate is only affected by $\eta$ in our case.







\section{Number of images}
\label{number of images}
In this part, we check the performance of our equations $n=2+\frac{1}{\eta}$ in specific situations which includes the Vacuum case, Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole, charged wormhole.
\subsection{Vacuum Case}
When $\eta=-1$, the metric \eqref{eq7} becomes Schwarzschild-like metric:
\begin{equation}
ds^2=-Adt^2+dr^2+r^2d\Omega^2.
\end{equation}
Our calculation shows the energy-momentum tensor is vanishing, thus we call it as the vacuum case. We solve the lensing equation and obtain
\begin{equation}
\theta=\frac{\pi D_{LS}}{2D_S\sqrt{A}}+\beta.
\end{equation}
For comparison, we substitute $\eta=-1$ into equation \eqref{eq 16}
\begin{equation}
n=2+\frac{1}{-1}=1.
\end{equation}
In the vacuum case, there will be at most one image, which is consistent with physical intuition.


\subsection{Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole}
We first discuss the number of images with the traditional method and then compare it with formula \eqref{eq 16}.
When redshift parameter $A=1$ and $\eta=1$ our metric turn to Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole
\begin{equation}
ds^2=-dt^2+\frac{dr^2}{1-\big(\frac{r_0}{r}\big)^{2}}+r^2d\Omega^2.
\end{equation}
The deflection angle for eq \eqref{eq 22} ($\eta=1$) is
\begin{equation}
\alpha=\frac{\pi}{4}\big(\frac{r_0}{b}\big)^2.
\end{equation}
So, the lens equation is
\begin{equation}
\theta^3-\beta\theta^2-\frac{\pi D_{LS}r_0^2}{4D_SD_L^2}=0.
\end{equation}
for a general cubic equation
$
ax^3+bx^2+cx^1+d=0,
$
The part discriminant is given
$
A=b^2-3ac \quad B=bc-9ad \quad   C=c^2-3bd.
$
The total discriminant is 
$
\varDelta =B^2-4AC.
$
We need $\varDelta<0$ to have three real solutions.
Using equation \eqref{eq 16},
\begin{equation}
n=2+\frac{1}{1}=3.
\end{equation}
We found that these two are consistent. This is not surprising, because Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole fits our previous metric \eqref{eq7}.



\subsection{Charged wormhole}
Referring to article \cite{Liu:2022lfb}, they show that there will be three images at most for the charged spherical symmetric wormhole and its metric \cite{Kim:2001ri} can also be expressed from 
\begin{equation}
ds^2=-\big(1+\frac{Q^2}{r^2}\big)dt^2+\big(1-\frac{r_0^2}{r^2}+\frac{Q^2}{r^2}\big)^{-1}dr^2+r^2d\Omega^2.
\end{equation}
Where $\frac{r_0^2}{r}$ is mass term.
We calculate the state coefficient with $\eta=\frac{p_r}{\rho}$. the result is
\begin{equation}
\eta=-\frac{r^4 \left(Q^4+Q^2 \left(r^2-r_0^2\right)+r^2 r_0^2\right)}{\left(Q^2+r^2\right)^2 \left(Q^2-r_0^2\right) \left(Q^2+r^2-r_0^2\right)},
\end{equation}
where $\eta$ is not a constant here, but $\eta$ is an approximately constant in our integral region, as shown in our numerical diagram Fig. \ref{fig:3}.
In the condition of the weak field and $r_0\ll r$ results in $\eta=1$, substituting equation \eqref{eq 16}
\begin{equation}
n=2+\frac{1}{1}=3.
\end{equation}
It demonstrates consistency in charged wormholes. We know equation \eqref{eq 16} was derived under the assumption of a constant redshift parameter, but this is reasonable that the limitation of microlensing makes $\underset{r\rightarrow\infty}{\lim}1+\frac{Q^2}{r^2}\approx 1$, which means that the observer is quite remote with source and wormhole.

\section{Conclusion and outlook}
\label{conclusion and outlook}
In this paper, we investigate the microlensing effects and the multi-image problem of static spherical wormhole \eqref{eq7}. By introducing the so-called REoS $\eta=\frac{p_r}{\rho}$, we can reformulate the metric \eqref{eq7}. Consequently, one can re-examine the microlensing effect of \eqref{eq7}, including its magnification, and event rate. In particular, one could obtain an explicit formula $n=2+\frac{1}{\eta}$ that reflects the maximum number of images on the equatorial plane. Our analysis shows that the investigation is consistent with the vacuum case, Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole, and charged wormhole. However, this formula is still unknown if considering a quantum-corrected wormhole whose metric is 
\begin{equation}
ds^2=-(1+\frac{\hbar q}{r^2})dt^2+\frac{dr^2}{1-\frac{b_0^2}{r^2}+\frac{\hbar q}{r^2}}+r^2d\Omega^2,
\label{quantum correction wormhole}
\end{equation}
where $\hbar q$ is from the quantum corrections. In the weak field approximation, one can obtain $\eta=\frac{b_0^2+q\hbar}{b_0^2-q\hbar}$. In the large scale ($b_0^2\gg \hbar q$), it will recover the Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole. In the small scale ($b_0^2\approx  \hbar q$), $\eta$ is variable that is determined by the $b_0^2/r$ (dubbed as mass part) and $q$ (dubbed as charge part). From another aspects, the order of lens equation is also unknown. For us, it is still mysterious for the wormhole with quantum corrections. Thus, we conclude that $n=2+\frac{1}{\eta}$ is valid for metric \eqref{eq7}. 





We also reformulate the magnification in terms of $\eta$, then used it to analyze the magnification of the Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole as an instance.
We find that the maximum magnification of an Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole only depends on the relative position $\frac{D_{LS}}{D_S}$ and intrinsic angle $\beta$, and in our case the maximum is about $5$, in which the photon is travelling near to the throat of wormhole. For the other types of static spherical wormholes, one can naturally extend our methods into multi-images cases which will be left for the future work. 

Instead of considering the hypothesis of a small wormhole ($r_0$ is at $10^3-10^{14}$ m), we consider a large-scale wormhole ($r_0$ is around $10^{20}$ m) that is evenly distributed throughout the universe. We calculated the event rate for a single wormhole situation. The event rates of the Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole and the charged wormhole are equal with the same $\eta$ under the microlensing conditions, and they are many orders of magnitude higher than vacuum. An interesting question is whether black holes and wormholes can be distinguished by event rates. Here, we only list some specific cases of the static spherical symmetric wormhole. For implementation into the blackhole, the difficulty is that we need the shape function of the metric of blackhole. Once finding the shape function as shown in \eqref{eq1}, it is possible to distinguish the wormhole and its associated blackhole \cite{Gao:2022cds}.

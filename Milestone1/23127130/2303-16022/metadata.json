    "abstract": "Considering two accelerated observers with same acceleration in two timelike wedges of Rindler frame we calculate all the thermal Feynmann propagators for a real scalar field with respect to the Minkowski vacuum. Only the same wedge correlators are symmetric in exchange of thermal bath and Unruh thermal bath. Interestingly, they contains a cross term which is a collective effects of acceleration and thermal nature of field. Partucularly the zero temperature description corresponds to usual thermofield double formalism. However, unlike in later formulation, the two fields are now parts of the original system. Moreover it bears the features of a spacial case of closed time formalism where the Keldysh contour is along the increasing Rindler time in the respective Rindler wedges through a specific complex time intra-connector. Hence Rindler frame field theory seems to be a viable candidate to deal thermal theory of fields and may illuminate the search for a bridge between the usual existing formalims.",

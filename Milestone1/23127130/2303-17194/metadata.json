    "abstract": "This research article introduces the concept of lightlike submanifolds of an indefinite Kenmotsu statistical manifold. Various results on geometry of contact CR and SCR-lightlike submanifolds have been developed. Some characterization theorems on the integrability of distributions and on the geodesicity of these submanifolds have been obtained. Appropriate examples have been presented.",

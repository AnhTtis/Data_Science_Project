    "abstract": "Linear regression models, especially the extended STIRPAT model, are routinely-applied for analyzing carbon emissions data. However, since the relationship between carbon emissions and the influencing factors is complex, fitting a simple parametric model may not be an ideal solution. This paper investigated various nonparametric approaches in statistics and machine learning (ML) for modeling carbon emissions data, including kernel regression, random forest and neural network. We selected data from ten Chinese cities from 2005 to 2019 for modeling studies. We found that neural network had the best performance in both fitting and prediction accuracy, which implies its capability of expressing the complex relationships between carbon emissions and the influencing factors. This study provides a new means for quantitative modeling of carbon emissions research that helps to understand how to characterize urban carbon emissions and to propose policy recommendations for \"carbon reduction\". In addition, we used the carbon emissions data of Wuhu city as an example to illustrate how to use this new approach.",

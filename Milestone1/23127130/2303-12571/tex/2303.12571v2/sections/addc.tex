The Address in Real Time Data Driver Card (ADDC)\,\cite{ADDC, ADDCprod,8376567,9058723} features two ART ASICs, two GBTx ASICs, one GBT-SCA ASIC, one VTTx optical transmitter and two FEAST ASICs.
The ADDC block diagram is shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:block_ADDC}.
Each ART ASIC receives the 320\,Mb/s ART data from 32 VMMs on four MMFE8 front-end boards.
In total 64 VMM ART signals are driven through eight MiniSAS cables to the ADDC. Each ART ASIC then transmits the data to the onboard GBTx.

The hit selection within the two ART ASICs has been explained in Section\,\ref{sec:ART}. Each GBTx ASIC transmits the data then to the Trigger Processor through one transmission channel of the VTTx.  The configuration and control of the ART and GBTx ASIC is achieved by the on-board GBT-SCA ASIC. The ASICs are powered through two on-board FEAST ASICs configured at 1.5\,V and 2.5\,V respectively.

Since the ADDC features only two transmission optical lines to minimize the fibre connections, each ADDC is connected to the GBTx on one L1DDC through a  MiniSAS cable.  Through this connection the following lines are provided to the on-board ASICs:

\begin{itemize}\itemsep-4pt
\item{SCA E-link: (three pairs,  BC clock, Tx/Rx data at 80\,Mb/s)}
\item{Two reference BC clocks, one for each of the GBTx ASICs}
\item{The BCR (Bunch Crossing Reset) signal}
\end{itemize}

\vspace{-6pt}\noindent Each of the GBTx ASICs is transmitting by itself the recovered and generated 40.079\MHz and 160.316\MHz clocks to each ART ASIC respectively.
In total 512 ADDC boards communicate with the 4096 front-end boards.

The ADDCs are placed on the edges of \MM detector along with the front-end boards (MMFE8) and the L1DDC boards.			 % "edges" is more descriptive than "sides".
The latency of the ADDC was measured to be $\sim$187\,ns, of which around 143\,ns is the latency of the GBTx plus VTTx dual optical transmitter module.

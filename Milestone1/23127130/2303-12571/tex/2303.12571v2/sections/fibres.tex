\section{Optical fibre interconnects}
\label{sec:fibres}
Fibres are used to connect between electronic boards on the NSW wheel itself in the collision cavern and the radiation-protected room (USA15).
All fibres are multi-mode {\small OM3} (allows transmission up to 10\,Gb/s) and radiation tolerant.
They range from LC-LC pairs to bundles of 36 and 144 fibres.
Figure\,\ref{fig:LL_FibreBlockDiagram_V01} shows a block diagram of the fibre path for one \MM or sTGC sector.

\caption{Block diagram of the trigger and readout fibre paths for one sector of sTGC \emph{or} \MM.
            \MM has 32 trigger inputs to the Small box, whereas sTGC has two additional inputs from the Pad Trigger for 34 inputs.
            Six output pairs of the sTGC Trigger Processor are used to fan out the segments to up to seven different Sector Logic sectors.
            When seven are required, a second Trigger Processor \gls{MTP}-24 IO connector is used.}

To minimize the trigger latency, the fibres to the Trigger Processors in USA15 pass through a special short path for ATLAS trigger fibres.
The need for several stages of fibre-to-fibre couplers as signals are aggregated to large fibre bundles introduces insertion loss at each coupler.
To have an optical power margin as large as possible despite these insertion losses, direct connections of fibre breakouts from the trunk cables are made to FELIX and the Trigger Processor,
i.e.\ there are no fibre patch panels in USA15 for fibres coming from the cavern.
Altogether, arriving in USA15, there are 2304 trigger fibres and 4608 readout fibres, including spares.
The MTP-36 cables between Small and Large boxes have different lengths depending on their angular position on the wheel.
For connection to FELIX, two \MM sectors share one 144-fibre readout trunk cable and two sTGC sectors another trunk cable.
For the trigger fibres, four sectors share a trunk cable.
The readout trunk cables were made long enough to reach almost anywhere in USA15 since it was not known where in USA15 the Phase\,2 FELIX servers would be located.

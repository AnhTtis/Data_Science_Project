abstract = {We present the design, characterization, and production of a signal packet router for the upgrade of the ATLAS forward muon detector. The router serves as a packet switch in one of the primary trigger paths. It handles up to 12 serial inputs at 4.8 Gbps/input from on-detector electronics and outputs four 4.8 Gbps to the trigger processing circuits. In the 12-to-4 packet switching process, the input streams are decoded and synchronized to a common clock domain for data packets forwarding and NULL packets suppression. Challenges in the design include operations of multi-giga hertz serial links with low and constant latency (<100 ns) for packet routing, as well as mitigation of radiation-induced effects in the harsh radiation environment over 10 years of detector operation. The Router design has been fully characterized and demonstrated to meet all specifications. In total 256 Routers were installed in the detector. Its design concept can be used in other similar applications, particularly in a radiation environment.}

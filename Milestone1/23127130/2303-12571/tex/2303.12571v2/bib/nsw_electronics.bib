      abstract = {The ATLAS collaboration at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN has endorsed the resistive-strip Micromegas technology for the high luminosity upgrade of the first muon station in the high-rapidity region, the so called “New Small Wheel” project. It requires detectors with a spatial resolution of ~100µm, fully efficient up to a particle rate of ~20kHz/cm2. In order to demonstrate that the resistive-strip Micromegas technology fulfils these requirements, small resistive bulk micromegas have been studied with radioactive sources and with high energy beams. The micromegas chambers were operated with an Ar+7%CO2 gas mixture and read out using the APV25 chip. Results on the detection efficiency and the position resolution are presented for track impact angles from 0° to 40°. A position reconstruction method has been developed for inclined tracks, called the “micro-TPC method”. A description of the method along with performance studies is presented. In addition, the impact of the unavoidable presence of pillars and the relative alignment of readout and resistive strips on the micromegas performance has been quantified. In view of the fact that the micromegas detectors will also contribute to the trigger in ATLAS their time response has been studied.}

The bit rate is programmable at 80, 160 or 320Mbit/s. Data jitter up to Â±3Â·Tbit/8 can be tolerated without jeopardizing the error-free data reception.

	abstract = {The ATLAS experiment at CERN is scheduled to replace the innermost station of its Muon Spectrometer in the forward region during its Phase-I upgrade in order to enhance the capabilities on triggering and tracking of high transverse momentum muons towards high luminosity LHC runs. The New Small Wheel (NSW), a completely new detector system to be built, is composed of two novel gaseous detectors: Micro-mesh Gaseous Structure (Micromegas) and the small-strip Thin Gap Chamber (sTGC). The sTGC sub-system is the primary trigger detector. It will be equipped with radiation-tolerant, low-latency electronics for reading out over 400,000 channels to identify the bunch crossing time of proton-proton collisions spaced by 25 ns, as well as to collect fine strip charge information for the charged track reconstruction. In this paper, we present the design and development of a set of Front-End Boards (FEBs) for the sTGC detector system. The major challenges in the design will be discussed. These include the accommodation of a few hundred readout channels per single board in a very constrained space, a tight requirement for the Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) protection of 130 nm ASICs, and customized analog input circuits to handle the high rate and high charge signals from the sTGC detectors. Moreover, the FEBs have to incorporate a few hundred parallel inter-chip links at 320 Mbps and several low-latency serial links operating at 4.8 Gbps for the Level-1 and trigger data readout. The characterization of the FEBs performance, both off-detector and on-detector, will be shown.}

To address these needs, the GBT (Giga-Bit Transceiver optical link [1,2]) architecture was developed to provide the simultaneous transfer of readout data, timing and trigger signals as well as slow control and monitoring data. The GBT-SCA ASIC, part of the GBT chip-set, has the purpose to distribute control and monitoring signals to the on-detector front-end electronics and perform monitoring operations of detector environmental parameters. In order to meet the requirements of different front-end ASICs used in the experiments, it provides various user-configurable interfaces capable to perform simultaneous operations. It is designed employing radiation tolerant design techniques to ensure robustness against SEUs and TID radiation effects and is implemented in a commercial 130 nm CMOS technology. This work presents the GBT-SCA architecture, the ASIC interfaces, the data transfer protocol, and its integration with the GBT optical link.}

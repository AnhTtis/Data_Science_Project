abstract = {With the luminosity upgrade of the LHC machine (SLHC, Super-LHC), the Muon system of the ATLAS experiment at CERN will also need a detector upgrade in the highest rapidity region. MAMMA, Muon ATLAS Micromegas Activity, is an ongoing R&D activity with the aim to develop large detectors based on the bulk-Micromegas technology for use in the ATLAS Muon Spectrometer. Micromegas is a good potential candidate for the construction of large muon chambers that combine trigger and tracking capability and can sustain high particle rates expected at the SLHC. A medium size Micromegas prototype, in scale 1:10 of the final chambers, has been built and evaluated in the laboratory and in beam tests at CERN. Results from the analysis of test-beam data are presented. The results indicate that large size Micromegas is a viable candidate for ATLAS Muon upgrade}

abstract = "{The instantaneous luminosity of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN will be increased up to a factor of five with respect to the present design value by undergoing an extensive upgrade program over the coming decade. The most important upgrade project for the ATLAS Muon System is the replacement of the present first station in the forward regions with the so-called New Small Wheels (NSWs). The NSWs will be installed during the LHC long shutdown in 2019/2020. Small-Strip Thin Gap Chamber (sTGC) detectors are designed to provide fast trigger and high precision muon tracking under the high luminosity LHC conditions. To validate the design, a full-size prototype sTGC detector of approximately 1.21.0m2 consisting of four gaps has been constructed. Each gap provides pad, strip and wire readouts. The sTGC intrinsic spatial resolution has been measured in a 32GeV pion beam test at Fermilab. At perpendicular incidence angle, single gap position resolutions of about 50m have been obtained, uniform along the sTGC strip and perpendicular wire directions, well within design requirements. Pad readout measurements have been performed in a 130GeV muon beam test at CERN. The transition region between readout pads has been found to be 4mm, and the pads have been found to be fully efficient.}"

It is the production version which will be used as the front ASIC for both Micromegas and sTGC detectors of the ATLAS Muon New Small Wheels upgrade at CERN. Due to its highly configurable parameters it has been proposed for several tracking detectors and other experiments. It is fabricated in the 130 nm Global Foundries 8RF-DM process. The ASIC integrates 64 channels, each providing charge amplification, discrimination, neighbour logic, amplitude and timing measurements, analog-to-digital conversions, and either direct output for trigger or multiplexed readout within a data-driven readout system. The front-end amplifier can operate with a wide range of input capacitances, has adjustable polarity, gain and peaking time. The ASIC has been tested on resistive Micromegas and sTGC prototypes in test beam campaigns at CERN.}

abstract = {Within 2015, the LHC operated close to the design energy of   ?s = 13–14 TeV delivering instantaneous luminosities up to   ? = 5 × 1033 cm?2s?1.  The   ATLAS Phase-I upgrade in 2018/19 will introduce the MicroMEGAS   detectors in the area of the small wheel at the end caps.   Accompanying new electronics are designed and built such as the VMM   front end ASIC, which provides energy, timing and triggering   information and allows fast data read-out.  The first VMM version   (VMM1) has been widely produced and tested in various test beams,   whilst the second version (VMM2) is currently being tested. This   paper focuses on the VMM1 single event upset studies and more   specifically on the response of the configuration registers under   harsh radiation environments. Similar conditions are expected at Run   III with ? = 2 × 1034 cm?2s?1 and a mean of 55   interactions per bunch crossing. Two VMM1s were exposed in a neutron   irradiation environment using the TANDEM Van Der Graaff accelerator   at NSCR Demokritos, Athens, Greece.  The results showed a rate of   SEU occurrences at a measured cross section of   (4.1±0.8)×10?14 cm2/bit for each   VMM. Consequently, when extrapolating this value to the luminosity   expected in Run III, the occurrence is roughly 6 SEUs/min in all the   read-out system comprising 40,000 VMMs installed during the Phase-I   upgrade.}

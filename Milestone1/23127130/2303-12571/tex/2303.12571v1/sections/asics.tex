The four NSW ASICs (VMM, ROC, TDS, ART) are fabricated in the Global Foundries 130\,nm 8RF-DM CMOS process on a common 8-inch wafer.
The reticle plan is shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:reticle}.

\caption{The NSW wafer reticle, showing the locations and relative sizes of two copies of the VMM3a, one ROC1 and one ROC2 along with the TDSvII and the ART2 ASIC. There are other ASICs for the ATLAS Calorimeter in the same reticle. As seen, the reticle contains two versions of the ROC ASIC. This was done in case the ROC2 version had an issue and the fall-back solution for scheduling reasons was the ROC1.  There are 86 reticles in the 8-inch wafer. Those on the perimeter, however, could not be used.  Each wafer contains 113 VMM3a, 66 ART2, 62 ROC1, 65 ROC2 and 65 TDSvII chips. The number that can be extracted depends on how the wafer is cut. The reticle size is $20798.32 \times 20795\,$\textmu m.}

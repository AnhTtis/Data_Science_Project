    "abstract": "Recently, various deep learning methods have shown significant successes in medical image analysis, especially in the detection of cancer metastases in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained whole-slide images (WSIs). However, in order to obtain good performance, these research achievements rely on hundreds of well-annotated WSIs. In this study, we tackle the tumor localization and detection problem under the setting of few labeled whole slide images and introduce a patch-based analysis pipeline based on the latest reverse knowledge distillation architecture. To address the extremely unbalanced normal and tumorous samples in training sample collection, we applied the focal loss formula to the representation similarity metric for model optimization. Compared with prior arts, our method achieves similar performance by less than ten percent of training samples on the public Camelyon16 dataset. In addition, this is the first work that show the great potential of the knowledge distillation models in computational histopathology.",

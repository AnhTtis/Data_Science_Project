abstract = {The years we are experiencing are often identified as those of the Age of Smart Technologies. Smart is now a very popular term, with the meaning of clever, intelligent, sharp, quick on the uptake. Its extensive meaning can be grasped if we consider it as an acronym for Self-Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology to indicate the essential features of the innovative technologies that characterize today's society in its daily life. Thus, the advent of the Smart Age, which is therefore the era of smart technologies, has heavily characterized and modified many aspects of today's society compared to the past. In this panorama, some arising questions regard transport infrastructure systems and, first of all, road transport. This research proposes a focus on one main issue: how roads fit into this smart revolution? Actually, the paper aims to offer an overview of the smart approach in road engineering by proposing a broad discussion about the current state of innovation in the smart roads field, i.e. the roads of the Smart Age. After defining the key functions of a smart road, the paper reviews some innovative technologies that make these items effective. These are studied in depth both with regard to motorway-type infrastructures and urban roads and intersections, with attention to the various technological aspects and to the benefits perceivable by management, users and the community. The paper, therefore, offers a bird's eye view of this extremely dynamic sector with innovative technologies for a new intelligent and connected mobility, and discusses some of their criticalities and strengths allowing for optimization and development of new transport functions and services, improving energy efficiency and promoting social, economic and environmental sustainability.}

abstract = {Threat modeling is widely adopted and increasingly recognized as an essential step in the secure software development life cycle (SDLC). Focused on privacy-specific threat categories, LINDDUN is a threat modeling framework that allows the identification of privacy-related design flaws at the stage of the initial architecture concept. LINDDUN advocates making explicit any assumptions during the identification and prioritization of privacy threats. These assumptions are in practice documented informally in a free-form, textual format, and the impact, nature and purpose of these assumptions within the context of LINDDUN is not well understood.We present a descriptive study of assumptions made during the application of LINDDUN. This empirical study involves in total 122 threat models created for an IoT-based home automation system and a total of 845 studied assumptions. This study focuses on (i) clarifying the role of assumption-making in the threat modeling process, and (ii) categorizing the types of information provided in these assumptions, and (iii) their relation to the LINDDUN threat categories or more broadly, any privacy-specific concepts.Our results indicate that in practice, (i) assumptions are used to motivate exclusion of potential threats, yet the rationale behind such decisions is often not documented, (ii) many assumption are about the system under analysis, and (iii) a majority is also relevant outside of the specific LINDDUN or privacy scope.},

abstract={The increasingly intelligent and connected vehicles have brought many unprecedented automotive cybersecurity threats, which may cause privacy breaches, personal injuries, and even national security issues. Before providing effective security solutions, a comprehensive risk assessment of the automotive cybersecurity must be carried out. A systematic cybersecurity risk assessment framework for automobiles is proposed in this study. It consists of an assessment process and systematic assessment methods considering the changes of threat environment, evaluation target, and available information in vehicle lifecycle. In the process of risk identification and risk analysis, the impact level and attack feasibility level are assessed based on the STRIDE model and attack tree method. An automotive cybersecurity risk matrix using a global rating algorithm is then constructed to create a quantitative risk metric. Finally, the applicability and feasibility of the proposed risk assessment framework are demonstrated through a use case, and the results prove that the proposed framework is effective. The proposed assessment framework helps to systematically derive automotive cybersecurity requirements.},

abstract={Ready or not, the digitalization of information has come, and privacy is standing out there, possibly at stake. Although digital privacy is an identified priority in our society, few systematic, effective methodologies exist that deal with privacy threats thoroughly. This paper presents a comprehensive framework to model privacy threats in software-based systems. First, this work provides a systematic methodology to model privacy-specific threats. Analogous to STRIDE, an information flow--oriented model of the system is leveraged to guide the analysis and to provide broad coverage. The methodology instructs the analyst on what issues should be investigated, and where in the model those issues could emerge. This is achieved by (i) defining a list of privacy threat types and (ii) providing the mappings between threat types and the elements in the system model. Second, this work provides an extensive catalog of privacy-specific threat tree patterns that can be used to detail the threat analysis outlined above. Finally, this work provides the means to map the existing privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) to the identified privacy threats. Therefore, the selection of sound privacy countermeasures is simplified.},

abstract={The advanced and personalised experience that modern cars offer makes them more and more data-hungry. For example, the cabin preferences of the possible drivers must be recorded and associated to some identity, while such data could be exploited to deduce sensitive information about the driver's health. Therefore, drivers' privacy must be taken seriously, requiring a dedicated risk assessment framework, as presented in this paper through a double assessment combining the asset-oriented ISO approach with the threat-oriented STRIDE approach. The framework is tailored to the level of specific car brand and demonstrated on the ten top-selling brands as well as, due to its innovative character, Tesla. The two approaches yield different, but complementary findings, demonstrating the additional insights gained through their parallel adoption.},

abstract = {Connected and autonomous vehicles produce, store and communicate a large amount of personal data (the route taken, the stop points, home and work addresses, etc.). The development of this type of vehicles brings the opportunity to offer new services to road users, with more software and hardware components on the vehicle. Many of these components suffer from weaknesses that can be exploited. The issue is that a single vulnerability in one element of the system will threaten the privacy of the vehicle's users (The weakest link principle of IT security). In this paper, we present a privacy threat analysis on the general architecture of connected and autonomous vehicles, to point out privacy risks according to formal privacy requirements. We present a use case modularization and its analysis that helps us to discern the privacy requirements of this use case, which can be enabled by manufacturers. To meet the previous objectives, we follow a LINDDUN methodology of privacy threat analysis}

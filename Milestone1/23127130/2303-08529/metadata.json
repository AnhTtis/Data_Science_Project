    "abstract": "We present the design and the absolute calibration of charged particle high-repetition-rate online readout CMOS system tailored for high-power laser experiments. This system equips a Thomson parabola (TP) spectrometer, used at the Apollon petawatt scale laser facility to measure the spectra of protons produced by high-intensity laser-target interactions. The RadEye1 CMOS matrixes array detectors are paired with a custom triggering system for image grabbing. This allows us to register the proton and ion signals remotely at a high-repetition-rate. The latter is presently of one shot/min, but the frame grabbing enables the system to be compatible with modern high-power lasers running e.g. at 10 Hz. We detail here the implementation, in the harsh electromagnetic environment of such interactions, of the system, and its absolute calibration of the RadEye CMOS matrices, which was performed for proton energies from 4 MeV to 20 MeV.",

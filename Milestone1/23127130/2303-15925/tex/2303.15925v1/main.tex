\begin{document}
\begin{abstract}
    In this paper, we study the generation of eigenvalues of a stable monotonic shear flow under perturbations in $C^s$ with $s<2$. More precisely, we study the Rayleigh operator $\mathcal{L}_{U_{m,\gamma}}= U_{m,\gamma}\partial_x-U''_{m,\gamma}\partial_x\Delta^{-1}$ associated with perturbed shear flow $(U_{m,\gamma}(y),0)$ in a finite channel $\mathbb{T}_{2\pi}\times [-1,1]$ where $U_{m,\gamma}(y)=U(y)+m\gamma^2\widetilde\Gamma(y/\gamma)$ with $U(y)$ being a stable monotonic shear flow and $\big\{m\gamma^2\widetilde\Gamma(y/\gamma)\big\}_{m\geq 0}$ being a family of perturbations parameterized by $m$. We prove that there exists $m_*$ such that for $0\leq m<m_*$, the Rayleigh operator has no eigenvalue or embedded eigenvalue, therefore linear inviscid damping holds. Otherwise, instability occurs when $m\geq m_*$. Moreover, at the nonlinear level, we show that asymptotic instability holds for $m$ near $m_*$ and a growing mode exists for $m>m_*$ which also leads to instability.

\section{Introduction}\label{Introduction}
\allowdisplaybreaks
We consider the two dimensional incompressible Euler equations in a finite $x$-periodic channel $\{(x,y): x\in \mathbb{T}_{2\pi},  y \in [-1,1]\},$
\begin{equation}\label{original euler}
 \begin{cases}
    \partial_t\tb{u} +\tb{u} \cdot \nabla \tb{u}+\nabla P=0 ,\\
   \nabla \cdot \tb{u}=0 ,\\
    v(t,x,-1)=0=v(t,x,1) ,
\end{cases}  
\end{equation}
 where $\tb{u}:=(u(t,x,y),v(t,x,y))$. Using the momentum (both horizontal and vertical) equations and incompressibility condition, one can recast \eqref{original euler} in terms of vorticity $\mathfrak{w}= v_x(t,x,y)-u_y(t,x,y)$ as follows
 \begin{equation}\label{Euler Equations}
     \partial_t \mathfrak{w} + \tb{u} \cdot \nabla \mathfrak{w}=0.
 \end{equation}
 A natural first step in our overall analysis is the linearization of \eqref{Euler Equations} around a shear flow $(U(y),0)$. This process yields the linearized problem
\begin{equation}\label{Linearized Euler Equations}
    \partial_t \omega + U(y)  \partial_x \omega +U''(y)\partial_x(-\Delta)^{-1}\omega=0,
\end{equation}
where we use $\omega$ to denote vorticity of the linearized equation. In terms of the stream function $\psi$, the linearized equation reads
\begin{equation} \label{linearized equation in terms of streamfunction}
    \partial_t \Delta \psi + U(y) \partial_x \Delta \psi-U''(y)\partial_x \psi=0.
\end{equation}

%When the linearization is done around the Couette flow, $U(y)\vec{e_1}=(y,0)$, the linearized equation becomes
%\begin{equation}\label{Linearized Euler Equations around Couette}
%    \partial_t \omega + U(y)  \partial_x \omega=0,
%\end{equation}
%where the last term in \eqref{Linearized Euler Equations} now disappears.

For the remaining portion of the paper, we will use $\mathcal{L}_{U}$ to denote the linearized operator displayed in \eqref{Linearized Euler Equations}, namely
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{U}=U(y)\partial_x - U''(y)\partial_x(\Delta^{-1}).
\end{equation} In the literature, the operator $\mathcal{L}_{U}$ goes by the name Rayleigh operator. Throughout the paper, we cling to the following assumptions on the background horizontal velocity $U$, 
\begin{enumerate}
[label=\textbf{(\subscript{A}{{\arabic*}})}]
    \item \label{Spectral} $\mathcal{L}_{U}$ has no eigenvalue or embedded eigenvalue.
    \item \label{Monotone} $U$ is monotonic, namely, there is $c_0$ such that $U'>c_0>0$.
\end{enumerate}

It is well-understood that if assumptions~\ref{Spectral} hold, then the background shear flow $(U(y),0)$ is linearly stable. Moreover, it was predicted earlier by Orr \cite{orr1907} in 1907 that for the Couette flow, the velocity converges to a shear flow as time goes to infinity. In the modern language, this phenomenon goes by the name inviscid damping. A couple decades after that, Case \cite{Case1960} predicted that the linear inviscid damping still holds true even for monotonic shear flows. Since then, there has been an immensely growing number of active research in the area.  We point readers to some of the recent papers on the subject: \cite{zillinger2017linear, WeiZhangZhao2015, jia2020linear,jia2020linearGevrey} for the results on the linear inviscid damping pertaining to monotonic shear flows. For non-monotonic shears, there is another interesting phenomena that has been observed at linear level known as vorticity depletion.  We also refer to some recent papers in this direction and references therein: \cite{bedrossiancotizelatiVicol2019vortex, WeiZhangZhao2019, WeiZhangZhao2020, IonescuJia2020,ionescuJia2022spectraldensity, ionescuSameerJia2022linear}.

Going back to inviscid damping, in the past few years, a number of breakthrough papers have been able to show that such damping mechanism indeed can be carried over from the linear to the nonlinear level. We mention some results by \cite{BedrossianMasoudi2015,  MasmoudiZhao2020, ionescuJia2020non, IonescuJia2022}. It is worth mentioning that the aforementioned papers require Gevrey-smooth perturbations in order to allow for the inviscid damping to occur. This triggers one to ask a question what if the perturbations is taken to be less smooth? It has been observed that the nonlinear inviscid damping has everything to do with the class of perturbation and the topology of the function space where the perturbation is taken. In \cite{LinZeng2011}, Lin and Zeng proved that nonlinear inviscid damping for Couette flow is not true when the velocity perturbation is chosen in $H^s$ for $s< 5/2$. Their idea is to perturb the Couette flow, such that the spectral assumption \ref{Spectral} fails to hold. More precisely, they proved that by choosing suitable $(m,\gamma)$, the Rayleigh operator $\mathcal{L}_{U_{m,\gamma}}$ has an embedded eigenvalue. The perturbed shear flow in their paper takes the form
\begin{equation*}
    (U_{m,\gamma},0)=\Big(y+m\gamma^2E\big(\frac{y}{\gamma}\big),0\Big),
\end{equation*} 
where $E$ is the error function. 

Studying the spectra of an operator under certain class of perturbation has been a classical subject of investigation in mathematics. For self-adjoint operators, in particular the Schr\"{o}dinger operator, the spectra theory is well-developed, see \cite{kato1995, Kiselev1998, ChristKiselev1998, Remling1998, simon2000schrodinger, killip2002perturbations} and the references therein. The present work sees the importance of studying the spectra of the linearized operator under a class of perturbation. In particular, we study the spectra changing of the Rayleigh operator 
\begin{equation}\label{linearized operator}
\mathcal{L}_{U_{m,\gamma}}= U_{m,\gamma}\partial_x-U''_{m,\gamma}\partial_x\Delta^{-1},
\end{equation}
associated with shear flow $(U_{m,\gamma}(y),0)$ in a finite channel $\mathbb{T}_{2\pi}\times [-1,1]$ where the perturbed horizontal velocity takes the form 
$$
U_{m,\gamma}(y)=U(y)+m\gamma^2\widetilde\Gamma(y/\gamma)
$$ with $\big\{m\gamma^2\widetilde\Gamma(y/\gamma)\big\}_{m\geq 0}$ being the family of the perturbations with an amplitude parameter $m$. 

\begin{comment}
    It is widely known that Euler equations \eqref{original euler} model the dynamics of inviscid (without viscosity) fluids, such as water. The complexity of the equations has given rise to a number of active research fields in mathematics, physics, engineering and other hard sciences. Among many of them is concerning the  hydrodynamics stability/instability. The investigation of stability/instability of inviscid fluids, in a nutshell,  can be regarded as an attempt to answer the question about ``how stable/unstable"  certain class of solutions of \eqref{original euler} are. The famous work of Lord Rayleigh \cite{Rayleigh1879} in 1879 started the investigation on the spectral stability or instability of planar non-viscous shear flows by looking at the existence of unstable eigenvalue. In the modern terminology, such approach goes by the name \textit{normal mode}. In the aforementioned paper, Rayleigh also presents a theorem concerning inflection point that, as a result, gives a criterion for spectral stability. Indeed, his theorem is proven to be useful and strong; it has been considered classical and used by many authors, see for instance \cite{WeiZhangZhao2015}.

Not long after that, Kelvin \cite{kelvin1887} presented the first construction of exact solutions to the linearized Euler equations around the Couette flow. Indeed, this is the first construction of solutions of the linearized problem: linearization of \eqref{Euler Equations} around the Couette flow. This flow is a special solution of \eqref{original euler} whose velocity field is of the form $\tb{u}=(y,0)$. In \cite{orr1907}, Orr showed that at the linear level, any sufficiently small disturbances applied to the Couette flow remains finite. This type of behavior is known as the \textit{inviscid damping} phenomenon, that is when the velocity field converges to zero as $t \to \infty$. This can be thought of as a linear stability phenomena. Such damping result had been proven earlier for Vlasov equation by Mouhot and Villani \cite{VilaniMouhot2011} which extended the \textit{Landau} damping from the linear to nonlinear level. We would like to note that unlike the exponential decay experienced in the Landau damping, the hydrodynamic decay found by Orr \cite{orr1907} is only at best algebraic in time.

%%% Content of the paper
The present work is inspired by the paper of Lin and Zeng \cite{LinZeng2011}. We manage to upgrade the results they attained in a number of aspects. Instead of working with Couette flow, we deal with a general class of monotonic shear flow $U(y)\vec{e_1}$. Additionally, we do not assume any oddness or eveness on the background shear flow. This causes the analysis to be several order of magnitude more complicated. The main objective of this paper is to construct solutions of \eqref{Euler Equations} as perturbations of a general class of monotonic shear flow:  We then study their dynamics in the spirit of \cite{LinZeng2011}. 

Additionally, in the construction of nonlinear steady solutions, we assume weaker regularity on $U$ which in general improves the result presented in \cite{LinZeng2011}. The main idea in the contruction is to recast the problem via an operator $\mathcal{F}$, precisely, $\mathcal{F}f=0$. Classically, in the bifurcation literature, the operator $\mathcal{F}$ is required to be of class $C^2$. Here, we are content that $\mathcal{F}$ to only be continuously differentiable. We show that under such weaker assumptions, the Crandall--Rabinowitz bifurcation framework can still be carried out. Lastly, we present an example of a class of shear flows that are linearly stable. Undergoing a $C^N$perturbation, we proved that the perturbed flows are still stable. As a corollary, nearby the perturbed flows, we obtain solutions that are asymptotically unstable.

%%% Commented Linearized equations
\begin{comment}
    \subsection{Linearized equations}
 

Furthermore, writing \eqref{Linearized Euler Equations} in terms of $\psi$ and  applying the Fourier transformation in $x$, one obtains
\[
(\partial_y^2-k^2)\partial_t \hat{\psi}=ik\bigg(U''(y)-U(y)(\partial_y^2-k^2))\bigg)\hat{\psi}.
\]
Composing the operator $(\partial_y-k^2)$ into the left and right hand sides of the above equation yields
\[
\dfrac{-1}{ik}\partial_t\hat{\psi}=\underbrace{-(\partial_y^2-k^2)^{-1}(U''(y)-U(y)(\partial_y^2-k^2))}_{\mathcal{R}_k} \hat{\psi}.
\]
Its eigenvalue problem, namely $\mathcal{R}_k\psi=c\psi$ gives rise to the Rayleigh equation
\begin{equation}\label{Rayleigh}
 -\psi_{yy}+\dfrac{U''(y)}{U(y)-c} \psi =-k^2 \psi,
\end{equation}
where we have dropped the $\hat{}$ notation. For the remaining part of this paper, we will limit ourselves and set $c=0$. 
\end{comment}
\subsection{Main results}
Let us now state the main contributions of the paper. In the present work, we classify three different regimes of the existence and nonexistence of eigenvalue or embedded eigenvalue of the Rayleigh operator \eqref{linearized operator} associated with the shear flow $(U_{m,\gamma}(y),0)$, where
\begin{equation}\label{perturbed shear}
    U_{m,\gamma}(y)=U(y)+ m \gamma\int_{0}^{y} \Gamma(z/\gamma)\; dz=:U(y)+m \gamma^2 \widetilde{\Gamma}(y/\gamma),
\end{equation}
and $\Gamma$ satisfies
\begin{equation}\label{condition on Gamma}
  \Gamma \in  H^4(\mathbb{R}),\quad -C_1<\dfrac{\Gamma'(y)}{y}<0,\quad \int_{\mathbb{R}} \dfrac{\Gamma' (y)}{y} \;dy=-1. 
\end{equation}

This classification depends on the distance of the parameter $m$ relative to $m_*$.
 \begin{theorem}[Linear]\label{linear}
Let $U \in C^4(-1,1)$ and satisfy \ref{Monotone} together with $ U(0)=0, U''(0)=0$ and $-C \leq U''(y)/U(y)\leq 0$. If the
assumption~\ref{Spectral} holds, then there exist $\delta_0$ and $\gamma_0>0$ such that for all $0<\gamma\leq \gamma_0$, there is $m_*$ so that the Rayleigh operator $\mathcal{L}_{U_{m,\gamma}}$
\begin{enumerate}[label=\normalfont{(\alph*)}]
    \item\label{Stability}\textup{(Stability)} has no eigenvalue or embedded eigenvalue when $0\leq m<m_*$;\\
    
    \item\label{Neutral mode} \textup{(Neutral mode)}  has only an embedded eigenvalue when $m=m_*$;\\
    
    \item\label{Instability} \textup{(Instability)} has at least two eigenvalues (each corresponds to unstable and stable mode respectively) when $m_*<m\leq m_*+\delta_0$.
\end{enumerate}
In the regime where $m_*<m\leq m_*+\delta_0$, if $\kappa=\kappa_r +i\kappa_i$ is the eigenvalue of $\mathcal{L}_{U_{m,\gamma}}$, then $\kappa_i=0$ and they satisfy the following estimate 
\begin{equation}\label{estimate for lambda r}
  C^{-1}\gamma |m-m_*|\leq |\kappa_r|\leq C\gamma |m-m_*|.  
\end{equation}
Here $C>1$ and $\delta_0$ are constants independent of $\gamma$. 
\end{theorem}
\begin{remark} Let us make a few remarks regarding our results in Theorem~\ref{linear}.
\begin{enumerate}[label=\normalfont{(\roman*)}]
    \item A direct application of the main result in \cite{WeiZhangZhao2015} informs us that the linear inviscid damping holds for the shear flows $(U_{m,\gamma},0)$ with $0\leq m<m_*$. 
    \item Since $\delta_0$ is independent of $\gamma$, the growing mode can reach the size $\approx \delta_0\gamma$ by increasing $m$, which also implies the lower bound of the semigroup for $m=m_*+\delta_0$
    \begin{equation*}
       \big\|e^{t\mathcal{L}_{U_{m,\gamma}}}\big\|_{L^2\to L^2}\geq C^{-1}e^{C^{-1}\delta_0\gamma t}.
    \end{equation*}
    \item We would like to highlight the implication of Theorem~\ref{linear} (c): there exists $\delta_1<\delta_0$ so that $m_*+\delta_1<m<m_*+\delta_0$, the shear flow $U_{m,\gamma}$ is also nonlinearly unstable. This follows from the result of Grenier \cite{Grenier2000}. Hence, in this regime, linear instability does imply nonlinear instability. We also refer to \cite{Lin2003, Vishik2003,deng2018long,DengZillinger2021} for recent instability results of shear flows. 
    \item  Although our work is done in the finite channel $\mathbb{T}_{2\pi} \times  [-1,1]$, it is indeed extendable to the infinite channel $\mathbb{T}_{2\pi} \times \mathbb{R}$. This requires some digressions into some of the details in our analysis. We avoid to pursue it here. 
    \item The parameter $m$ in the Theorem~\ref{linear} is  taken to be near $m_*$. As seen in the statement, the emergence or disappearance of eigenvalues or embedded eigenvalue hinges  on the location of $m$ relative to $m_*$.  In the paper \cite{limasmoudizhao2022} the authors prove existence of growing modes for $m>M_0$, where $M_0$ is required to be sufficiently large. The result in the present work is different compared to theirs in which ours focuses more on the regime where $m>M_0$ and $m_*\ll M_0$. Additionally, here we work with a general monotonic background shear flow rather than Couette flow. We also manage to obtain a precise description on how a growing mode is generated as the parameter $m$ varies. 
    
     We use an implicit function argument in our proof, which may not allow $\delta_0$ to be large. It is interesting to follow the movement of the eigenvalue as $m$ increasing and connect two regions discussed in \cite{limasmoudizhao2022} and this paper. This may require some global bifurcation argument. 
    \item We also introduce the general transition threshold problem we tackle for a family of linear operators which is closely related to the stability problem: 

    Let $T$ be a linear operator and $\{L_m\}_{m\in [a,b]}$ be a family of linear perturbation operators continuous in $m$ with $L_a=0$. Let $A\subset \mathbb{C}$ be the region that we are interested in. Suppose that at $m=a$,  the operator $T$ has no eigenvalue in $A$, namely, $\sigma_d(T)\cap A=\emptyset$ and at $m=b$, the operator $T+L_b$ has eigenvalue in $A$. One can then ask the following question : Determine the largest $m_1$ such that $\sigma_d(T+L_m)\cap A=\emptyset$ for $a\leq m<m_1$ and the smallest $m_2$ such that $\sigma_d(T+L_m)\cap A\neq \emptyset$ for $m_2 <m\leq b$? In spirit, this is essentially the question we are tackling here.
\end{enumerate}
\end{remark}
Next, we state our second result pertaining instability of $U_{m,\gamma}$ at the nonlinear level. We regard it as a quantitative description of the ``boundary'' between the linearly stable shear flows and linearly unstable shear flows. We record it below.
 \begin{theorem}[Nonlinear]\label{nonlinear}
Fix $N\in \mathbb{Z}^+ \cup \{0\}$. Consider $U_{m,\gamma} \in C^{2N+4}(-1,1)$ given by \eqref{perturbed shear} satisfying the assumptions in Theorem~\ref{linear} and the condition
\[
  U^{(2n)}_{m,\gamma} (0)=0, \text{ for } n=1,2,...,N, N+1.
\]
Let $\gamma_0$ and $m_*$ be the same as in Theorem~\ref{linear}. 
Then for all $0\leq\gamma<\gamma_0$ and $m$ satisfying 
\begin{align*}
    |m-m_*|\leq C \gamma^N,
\end{align*} 
there exists a nontrivial steady solution $(u(x,y),v(x,y))$ close to the background shear flow $(U_{m,\gamma}(y),0)$ in the following sense 
    \begin{equation}\label{norm of the distance background and nontrivial}
    \norm{(u(x,y),v(x,y))-(U_{m,\gamma}(y),0)}_{H^{5/2-\tau+N}(\mathbb{T}_{2\pi} \times (-1,1))}\leq \gamma^\tau,
    \end{equation}
for any $0<\tau<1$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{remark}
    Let us make a few remarks regarding our results in Theorem \ref{nonlinear}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The authors \cite{LinZeng2011} consider the Couette flow. Their results coincide with ours precisely when we set $N=0$, $U(y)=y$, and $\Gamma(y)=2e^{-y^2}/\sqrt{\pi}$. They proved that the stable Couette flow becomes unstable when the perturbation is taken in weaker topology, namely in the Sobolev space $H^{5/2-}$. In the present work, we verify that at the nonlinear level, the parameter $m$ also plays a key role. Concretely, it is related to the regularity of the function space where the perturbation that leads to asymptotic instability is taken: when $m$ is chosen even closer to $m_*$, one can take the perturbation in a smoother Sobolev space.   
        \item We refer to \cite{LinWeiZhangZhu2022,wang2022dynamics,castro2023traveling,franzoi2023space} for recent works on the nontrivial stationary solutions near Couette flow and to \cite{coti2023stationary} for the stationary structures near the Kolmogorov and Poiseuille flows. 
        \item We also mention some results on the 2-D water wave problem with constant vorticity \cite{Berti2021,sinambela2022existence,haziot2022traveling} and references therein.
    \end{itemize}
    
\end{remark}

%%NOTATIONS and CONVENTIONS
Before stating the idea of our proofs, we would like to introduce notations and conventions that are used frequently throughout the rest of the paper. We record them in the following subsection. 
\subsection{Notations and conventions} 
We use symbols $'$ and $''$ to denote the first and second derivative in $y$, respectively. Additionally, we will use $f^{(n)}(y)$ to mean the $n$-th derivative of the function $f$ with respect to $y$. Due to a number of parameters and variables involved in our analysis, we would like to point out conventions we have followed throughout the paper. For eigenfunctions, solutions of differential equation, or any other functions used in our analysis, in general, they will depend on the variables/parameters: $y,m,\gamma,c,\lambda$. The function and its complete (ordered) argument appear as $\phi(y,m,\gamma,c,\lambda)$. 

However, we warn readers that the argument in the function may change depending on the context. The reason for this is to keep the notation simpler and compact when possible. More precisely, if a priori we know that one (or more) of the variables/parameters in the argument is set to $0$, then we suppress the dependency of that variable(s)/parameter(s) in the argument of the function. For instance, let us say that we fix $\gamma=0$, then the function $\phi$ together with its argument read $\phi(y,m,c,\lambda)$. Additionally, if, on top of $\gamma=0$, we fix another variable: $c=0$, then the function and its argument read $\phi(y,m,\lambda)$. If the variable(s)/parameter(s) is fixed to a specific value other than $0$, then we shall display the value on the fixed variable(s)/parameter(s) in the function. 

In the present work, the constants in our computations will be denoted in various ways. We use $C, c_0, C_0$ and $C_1$ to mean some generic positive constants. In general, we do not display the parameter on which they depend on. However, there are a few parts in our analysis where we explicitly state the variable dependency in the constant.

Throughout our estimates, we will frequently use the notations $``\lesssim", ``\gtrsim", ``\approx"$. For arbitrary functions $f$ and $g$, the inequality $f \lesssim g$ means that there exists a constant C such that $f \leq C g$. Similarly, $f \gtrsim g$  means that there exists $C$ such that $f \geq C g$. Lastly, the notation $f \approx g$ is equivalent to the statement that $C^{-1}g \leq f \leq C g$, for some consant $C$. 

\subsection{Idea of the proofs}
In this subsection, we outline key ideas and mathematical machinery used in our proofs. We fix the two parameters $m,\gamma$ at the outset. Concerning Theorem~\ref{linear}, we will work for the most part with the linearized equation in terms of the voriticity \eqref{Linearized Euler Equations} or stream function \eqref{linearized equation in terms of streamfunction}. When the background shear $(U,0)$ is replaced by $(U_{m,\gamma},0)$, followed by taking the Fourier transform in $x$ of \eqref{Linearized Euler Equations}, we obtain
\[
\dfrac{-1}{ik}\partial_t \hat{\omega}=\mathcal{R}_{m,\gamma,k} \hat{\omega},
\] where
$\mathcal{R}_{m,\gamma,k}=(U_{m,\gamma}(y)-U''_{m,\gamma}(y)(\partial_y^2-k^2)^{-1})$.
If $c=c_r+ic_i \in \mathbb{C}$ is an eigenvalue of the operator $\mathcal{R}_{m,\gamma,k}$, then there exists a function $\Omega(y,m,\gamma,c,k) \in L^2(-1,1)$ such that 
\begin{equation}\label{operator R}
   \mathcal{R}_{m,\gamma,k}\Omega(y,m,\gamma,c,k)  =c \Omega(y,m,\gamma,c,k),
\end{equation}
where
\[
\Delta \Phi(y,m,\gamma,c,k)=\Omega(y,m,\gamma,c,k), \qquad \Phi(\pm1,m,\gamma,c,k)=0.
\]
 This leads us to the Rayleigh equation
\begin{equation}\label{Rayleigh Equation}
    -\partial^2_y \Phi(y,m,\gamma,c,k)+\dfrac{U''_{m,\gamma}}{U_{m,\gamma}-c}\Phi(y,m,\gamma,c,k)=-k^2\Phi(y,m,\gamma,c,k),
\end{equation} 
with $\Phi(-1,m,\gamma,c,k)=\Phi(1,m,\gamma,c,k)=0$. The homogeneous Rayleigh equation is well studied in \cite{WeiZhangZhao2015, limasmoudizhao2022} for a fixed shear flow. In this paper, the shear flow is changing as the parameters $m,\gamma$ vary. For this reason, we derive some uniform estimates related to the solutions of \eqref{Rayleigh Equation} on these parameters. See Lemma~\ref{phi1 phi2} in Appendix~\ref{Related Results}. We regard Appendix~\ref{Related Results} as a toolbox of estimates in our overall analysis.

For the most part, our main strategy is to study the eigenvalues of the Rayleigh operator \eqref{operator R}. In fact, this is equivalent to studying the eigenvalue of the Schr\"{o}diger-type operator found in \eqref{Rayleigh Equation}. We provide Remarks~\eqref{connection between c and k^2} and \eqref{TFAE statement} to elaborate more on the connection between the eigenvalues of the Rayleigh operator \eqref{linearized operator}, $\mathcal{R}_{m,\gamma,k}$ \eqref{operator R} and the Schr\"{o}dinger-type operator in \eqref{Rayleigh Equation}. 

Understanding the eigenvalue problem for Schr\"{o}dinger-type operator \eqref{Rayleigh Equation} for $c=0$ plays an undoubtedly crucial role in studying the transition threshold considered here. For convenience, the eigenvalue problem for the Schr\"{o}dinger-type operator for $c=0$ is recast alternatively as
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{H}_{m,\gamma}\Phi=-k^2 \Phi,
\end{equation}
where $ \mathcal{H}_{m,\gamma}$ is given by
\begin{equation}\label{operator H}
     \mathcal{H}_{m,\gamma}:=-\partial^2_y+Q_{m,\gamma}(y),
\end{equation}
 with
 \begin{equation}\label{Q}
 Q_{m,\gamma}(y):=\dfrac{U''_{m,\gamma}(y)}{U_{m,\gamma}(y)}.
 \end{equation}
  \begin{remark}\label{connection between c and k^2}We would like to highlight the following important points regarding the connection between eigenvalues of $\mathcal{R}_{m,\gamma,k}$ and $\mathcal{H}_{m,\gamma}$:
     \begin{itemize}
         \item In light of equation \eqref{operator R}, if $c=0$ is an embedded eigenvalue of the operator $\mathcal{R}_{m,\gamma,k}$, then $-k^2$ is an eigenvalue of the operator $\mathcal{H}_{m,\gamma}$ with $-1\geq -k^2 \geq \lambda_{m,\gamma}$.
         \item Moreover, if $\lambda_{m,\gamma}\geq -1$, then $-k^2$ cannnot be an eigenvalue of $\mathcal{H}_{m,\gamma}$ which implies that $c=0$ is not an embedded eigenvalue of the operator $\mathcal{R}_{m,\gamma,k}$.
     \end{itemize}
 \end{remark}
\subsubsection{Determining $m_*$}
To determine $m_*$, we study the Schr\"{o}dinger-type  operator $  \mathcal{H}_{m,\gamma}$. 
Let $\lambda_{m,\gamma}$ be the minimal eigenvalue associated with $ \mathcal{H}_{m,\gamma}$, then 
\begin{equation}\label{lambda m gamma}
    \lambda_{m,\gamma}= \min_{\substack{\lVert \Psi\rVert_{L^2}=1 \\ \Psi \in H^1_0}}(\mathcal{H}_{m,\gamma} \Psi,\Psi)=\min_{\substack{\lVert \Psi\rVert_{L^2}=1 \\ \Psi \in H^1_0}}\int_{-1}^{-1} |\partial_y\Psi|^2+\int_{-1}^1 Q_{m,\gamma}(y)|\Psi|^2\;dy.
\end{equation}
 We write the associated quadratic form as
\begin{equation}\label{quadratic form 2}
 H_{m,\gamma} \Psi:=\lVert \Psi' \rVert_{L^2}^2 + \int_{-1}^{1} Q_{m,\gamma}(y) |\Psi|^2 \; dy.
 \end{equation}
 Let $\Psi(y,m,\gamma,c,\lambda_{m,\gamma})$ be the eigenfuntion associated with the minimal eigenvalue $\lambda_{m,\gamma}$. From \eqref{lambda m gamma}, one can see that the function $\Psi(y,m,\gamma,\lambda_{m,\gamma})$ solves the Rayleigh equation \eqref{Rayleigh Equation} along with the boundary conditions for $c=0$ and $-k^2$ being replaced by $\lambda_{m,\gamma}$.

Furthermore, as $\gamma \to 0$, we obtain 
\[
(\mathcal{H}_{m,\gamma} \Psi,\Psi)\to (\mathcal{H}_{m,0} \Psi,\Psi):= \int_{-1}^{-1} |\partial_y\Psi|^2+\int_{-1}^{1}\dfrac{U''}{U}|\Psi|^2\;dy-\dfrac{m|\Psi(0)|^2}{U'(0)}.
\]
Similarly, let $\lambda_{m,0}$ be the minimal eigenvalue associated with $ \mathcal{H}_{m,0}$, then 
\[
\lambda_{m,0}= \min_{\substack{\lVert \Psi\rVert_{L^2}=1 \\ \Psi \in H^1_0}}(\mathcal{H}_{m,0} \Psi,\Psi).
\]
Additionally, the corresponding quadratic form is given by 
\begin{equation}\label{quadratic form 1}
 H_{m,0} \Psi:=\lVert \Psi' \rVert_{L^2}^2 + \int_{-1}^{1} \dfrac{U''}{U} |\Psi|^2 \; dy-\dfrac{m |\Psi(0)|^2}{U'(0)}.
 \end{equation} 
 Hence, the eigenfunction $\Psi(y,m,\gamma,\lambda_{m,0})$ associated with the minimal eigenvalue $\lambda_{m,0}$ is the solution of the associated Euler–Lagrange equation 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Euler-Lagrange}
    -\partial^2_y \Psi +\dfrac{U''(y)}{U(y)}\Psi-\dfrac{m\Psi(0)\delta(0)}{U'(0)}=\lambda_{m,0}\Psi,\quad \Psi(y=\pm1)=0.
\end{equation}

In Lemma~\ref{Monotonicity}, we obtain an explicit formula given by  the function $\mathfrak{M}$ which explains the relationship  between $m$ and $\lambda$ such that \eqref{eq:Euler-Lagrange} admits a nontrivial solution. Moreover, we show that $\mathfrak{M}$ is monotonic. As for the minimal eigenvalue $\lambda_{m,\gamma}$ of $\mathcal{H}_{m,\gamma}$, we also obtain the monotonicity with respect to the parameter $m$, see Lemma~\ref{monotonicity of lambda m gamma}.
We then derive an inequality that connects the two minimal  eigenvalues that is 
\[
|\lambda_{m,\gamma}-\lambda_{m,0}|\lesssim m \gamma. 
\] 
It will be clear later that from this inequality, for any fixed $\gamma$ small, one can determine $m_*$ such that $\lambda_{m_*,\gamma}=-1$.

\subsubsection{Stability for $m<m_*$} Since the eigenvalue problem \eqref{Rayleigh Equation} is an ODE problem, it is natural to introduce the associated Wronskian. We recall that the Wronskian of two solutions $f$ and $g$ to a second order ODE is given by 
\[
\mathcal{W}[f,g]=fg'-f'g.
\] If $\mathcal{W}[f,g]=0$, then $f$ and $g$ are linearly dependent, i.e. $f=Cg$, for some constant $C$. Let $\varphi^{-}(y,m,\gamma,c,\lambda)$ and $\varphi^{+}(y,m,\gamma,c,\lambda)$ be two solutions of the Rayleigh equation \eqref{Rayleigh Equation} with $-k^2=\lambda$ satisfying the conditions:
\begin{equation}\label{boundary conditions for varphi}
    \varphi^{-}(-1,m,\gamma,c,\lambda)=0=\varphi^{+}(1,m,\gamma,c,\lambda)\text{ and }(\varphi^{-})'(-1,m,\gamma,c,\lambda)=1=(\varphi^{+})'(1,m,\gamma,c,\lambda).
\end{equation}
Direct computation yields the Wronskian of these two solutions is $y-$independent, namely
\[
\partial_y \mathcal{W}[\varphi^{-},\varphi^{+}](y,m,\gamma,c,\lambda)=\partial_y\bigg(\varphi^{-}(\varphi^{+})'-(\varphi^{-})'\varphi^{+}\bigg)=0.
\]

As a result, upon computing the Wronskian of $\varphi^{-}$ and $\varphi^{+}$ and using the boundary conditions of $\varphi^{+}$ and $(\varphi^{+})'$ at $y=1$, we can infer 
\begin{equation}\label{wronskian of generic varphi}
   \mathcal{W}[\varphi^{-},\varphi^{+}](m,\gamma,c,\lambda)=\varphi^{-}(1,m,\gamma,c,\lambda). 
\end{equation}

By far, we have introduced three operators, eigenvalue problem associated with each of them and the notion of Wronskian of two solutions $\varphi^-$ and $\varphi^+$. To clear some things up and highlight the connections between them, we present the following remark:
\begin{remark}\label{TFAE statement}
    For any $k\in \mathbb{Z}\setminus\{0\}$. The following statements are equivalent for $c\notin \mathbb{R}$:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\kappa=ikc$ is an eigenvalue of the Rayleigh operator $\mathcal{L}_{U_{m,\gamma}}$;
        \item $c$ is an eigenvalue of the operator $\mathcal{R}_{m,\gamma,k}$;
        \item There is a nontrivial solution $\Phi$ solving the Rayleigh equation \eqref{Rayleigh Equation};
        \item $-k^2$ is an eigenvalue of the Schr\"{o}diger-type operator $-\partial^2_{y}+\frac{U''_{m,\gamma}}{U_{m,\gamma}-c}$;
         \item $c$ is a zero of $\mathcal{W}[\varphi_1,\varphi_2](m,\gamma,c,\lambda)$;
        \item $\varphi_1(y=1,m,\gamma,\lambda)=0$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{remark}
It is well-known that due the Howard’s semicircle theorem \cite{Howard1961}, the eigenvalues $c$ of the operator $\mathcal{R}_{m,\gamma,k}$ belong to a semicircle on the complex plane. In light of that, we introduce the following two sets:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    &\mathfrak{B}:=\Bigl\{c=c_r+ic_i:\bigg(c_r-\dfrac{U_{m,\gamma}(-1)+U_{m,\gamma}(1)}{2}\bigg)^2+(c_i)^2 \leq \dfrac{\big(U_{m,\gamma}(1)-U_{m,\gamma}(-1)\big)^2}{2}\Bigr\}\subset \mathbb{C},\\
    &\mathfrak{D}_{\epsilon_0}:=\Bigl\{c=c_r+ic_i: c_r \in \text{Ran}(U_{m,\gamma})\text{ and } 0\leq |c_i|<\epsilon_0 \Bigr\}\subset \mathbb{C}.
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation} 
In the aforementioned paper, the theorem essentially asserts that for $c\notin \mathfrak{B}$, $\mathcal{W}[\varphi_1,\varphi_2](m,\gamma,c,\lambda)\neq 0$. It is also easy to check that for $|\lambda|>C_0$ with $C_0>0$ large enough, $\mathcal{W}[\varphi_1,\varphi_2](m,\gamma,c,\lambda)\neq 0$ for all $c$, see for instance \cite[Proposition 4.5] {Grenier2000}. Thus we only focus on the case $\big\{(c,\lambda):~|\lambda|\leq C_0,\ c\in \mathfrak{B}\big\}$ which is compact. Moreover, we have an explicit formula for the Wronskian when $c\in \mathfrak{D}_{\epsilon_0}$, see equation \eqref{wronskian of varphi}.

To prove the stability for $m<m_*$, we apply the Rouche’s theorem from complex analysis and use a contradiction argument. We first show that the Rayleigh operator has no embedded eigenvalue. Secondly, we show the nonexistence of eigenvalue $c\in \mathfrak{B}$ with $c_i \neq 0$. The argument goes as follows: if there is an eigenvalue in $\mathfrak{B}$ with $c_i\neq0$ for $m<m_*$, then such eigenvalue should be generated by an embedded eigenvalue. However, since there is no embedded eigenvalue hence there is no such eigenvalue with $c_i \neq 0$. The nonexistence of eigenvalue is equivalent to the nonexistence of growing mode in the regime $m<m_*$. 

\subsubsection{Instability for $m>m_*$} To show the existence of growing mode, we study the zeros of the Wronskian $\mathcal{W}[\varphi^{-},\varphi^{+}](m,\gamma, c, -1)$. We prove that as $m$ getting large slightly away from $m_*$, the eigenvalue $c$ moves to the pure imaginary line, namely, there is $c_i(m)$ such that $c_i(m_*)=0$ and 
$$\mathcal{W}[\varphi^{-},\varphi^{+}](m,\gamma, ic_i,-1)=0,$$
for $m_*\leq m<m_*+\delta_0$. This is done by studying the partial derivatives of the modified Wronskian $W(m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)$ with respect to $c_i$, $m,$ and applying the implicit function theorem. 

\subsubsection{Nonlinear asymptotic instability for $m$ near $m_*$}
To prove nonlinear asymptotic instability, our argument relies on the Crandall--Rabinowitz local bifurcation theory. Using the observation that any stream function that solves $\Delta \psi = \widetilde G \circ \psi$ gives rise to a steady solution of the nonlinear problem \eqref{Euler Equations}, we apply the bifurcation theory to the Poisson problem. Due to the lack of evenness in our background stream function $\psi_0$, we work with the modified $\psi_0$ given by $\widetilde \psi_0$. The map $\widetilde G$ is given by the  modified background stream function via $\widetilde G(\widetilde\psi_0)=\mathcal{U}'(y)$.  Such map is well-defined at $y=0$. However, it is not obvious that its higher derivatives are still continuous at $y=0$. Due to the vanishing assumptions at $y=0$ on even derivatives of $\mathcal{U}$, we show that $\widetilde G$ is sufficiently smooth for all values of $y$. This result is recorded in Lemma~\ref{regularity lemma}. Upon checking all the assumptions to apply the local bifurcation theory, we deduce the existence of local curve of solutions bifurcating from the background shear $(\mathcal{U},0)$.

For fixed $\gamma \in (0,\gamma_0)$, one can choose  $m_1$ and $m_2$ close enough to $m_*$ so that $\lambda_{m_1,\gamma}<-1<\lambda_{m_2,\gamma}$. We then pick $m^\circ \in (m_1,m_2)$. Instead of bifurcating from the generic background shear $(\mathcal{U},0)$, we bifurcate our local curve of solutions from  $(U_{m^\circ,\gamma},0)$. The $m^\circ$ is chosen such that we obtain a local curve of solutions that exhibits a nontrivial (non-sheared) steady solution with $k=1$. By doing this, we confirm an existence of a nontrivial steady solution that is $2 \pi$-periodic in $x$ which proves the nonlinear asymptotic instability. 
\section{Preliminary}\label{Preliminary}

\subsection{Plan of the article}
 Let us now outline the general structure of the paper. In Section~\ref{Preliminary}, we record some estimates concerning distance between eigenvalues and monotonicity properties. As will be seen later, these estimates are crucial in proving our two main results. In the same section, we have provided some more discussions on the Wronskian. 

The main results of the present work are proved in Section~\ref{proof of main results}. The section is started with proof Theorem~\ref{linear}. The proof is partitioned into into four parts, each devoted to \ref{Stability}, \ref{Neutral mode}, \ref{Instability} and the estimate in \eqref{estimate for lambda r}. Following that is the proof of Theorem~\ref{nonlinear}. As an intermediate step, we have included a lemma on a bifurcation result that is important to close our argument in Theorem~\ref{nonlinear}. 

Finally, we have included two appendices: Appendix~\ref{Related Results} and Appendix~\ref{Regularity}. The first appendix contains some estimates concerning  functions in the expression of the regular solution of the Rayleigh equation. The second appendix is devoted to discuss the regularity of the the map $\widetilde{G}$. 


\subsection{Estimates} The following subsection is aimed to present important estimates on the location of eigenvalues and monotonicity results that are fundamental in our analysis. The whole idea hinges on the careful study of the Rayleigh equation \eqref{Rayleigh Equation} and an ODE-type of argument. In particular, at $c=0$, we manage to understand how eigenvalue transitions as we fix one parameter and vary the rest. 
The Rayleigh equation \eqref{Rayleigh Equation} has rather a delicate limiting structure as the parameter $\gamma \to 0$. To this end, we show the convergence of the the Rayleigh equation \eqref{Rayleigh Equation}. In light of our interest in steady solutions, taking $c=0$, we obtain 
\begin{equation}\label{Rayleigh equation at c=0}
    -\partial^2_y \Phi(y,m,\gamma,\lambda)+Q_{m,\gamma}\Phi(y,m,\gamma,\lambda)=\lambda \Phi(y,m,\gamma,\lambda),
\end{equation}
where $Q(y,m,\gamma,\lambda)$ is as in \eqref{Q}. Explicity, it takes the form
\[
  Q(y,m,\gamma,\lambda)= \dfrac{U''(y)}{U_{m,\gamma}(y)}+\dfrac{m\Gamma'(y/\gamma)}{\gamma(y/\gamma)}\dfrac{1}{\frac{U(y)}{y}+\gamma m \widetilde{\Gamma}(y/\gamma)/(y/\gamma)}.
 \] 
 
It is easy to check that $\Phi(y,m,\gamma, \lambda)$ solves \eqref{Rayleigh equation at c=0}, if and only if the following identity
\begin{equation}\label{weak formulation}
    -\int_{-1}^1\Phi(y,m,\gamma, \lambda)\partial_{yy}\varphi(y)
    +Q_{m,\gamma}\Phi(y,m,\gamma, \lambda)\varphi(y)dy=\lambda\int_{-1}^1\Phi(y,m,\gamma, \lambda)\varphi(y)dy
\end{equation}
holds for any test function $\varphi\in H_0^1(-1,1)$.
Taking $\gamma \to 0$ leads to
\[
 Q(y,m,\gamma,\lambda)\to \dfrac{U''(y)}{U(y)}-\dfrac{m\delta(0)}{U'(0)}. 
 \]
Hence, for all test functions $\varphi \in H^1_0(-1,1)$ we have 
\begin{equation}\label{Rayleigh equation at gamma 0}
   \int_{-1}^1 -\Phi(y,m,\lambda)\partial^2_y \varphi(y)  + \dfrac{U''(y)}{U(y)} \Phi(y,m,\lambda)\varphi(y)-\lambda  \Phi(y,m,\lambda)\varphi(y) dy =\dfrac{m\Phi (0,m,\lambda)\varphi(0)}{U'(0)},
\end{equation}
 In other words, when $\gamma=0$, the Rayleigh equation becomes a second order differential equation, namely
 \begin{equation}\label{second order DE}
     \partial^2_y \Phi(y,m,\lambda) - \dfrac{U''(y)}{U(y)}\Phi(y,m,\lambda)+\lambda\Phi(y,m,\lambda)=-\dfrac{m}{U'(0)} \Phi(0,m,\lambda)\delta(0).
 \end{equation}
 
The following lemma records a sufficient and necessary condition for the differential equation in \eqref{second order DE} to admit a nontrivial solution. Moreover, it also asserts that  $m$ which is proved to be $\lambda$-dependent satisfies some monotonicity condition with respect to $\lambda$. 
\begin{lemma}[Monotonicity of $m$]\label{Monotonicity} The differential equation \eqref{second order DE} admits a nontrivial solution for  fixed $m$ with $\lambda<0$ if and only if $m=\mathfrak{M}(\lambda)$, for some function $\mathfrak{M}$. Moreover, $m$ is strictly decreasing with respect to $\lambda$, 
\begin{equation}
    \partial_{\lambda}\mathfrak{M}<0.
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
   Our proof relies on the representation of solution of \eqref{second order DE}. As it will be clear soon that such representation gives us a precise description on how the eigenvalue $\lambda$ and the parameter $m$ are related from which the monotonicity result then follows. 
 
 Naturally, in order to solve \eqref{second order DE} one would want to solve the homogeneous version of it which is
\begin{equation}\label{homogeneous DE}
\widetilde{\phi}''(y,\lambda)-\dfrac{U''(y)}{U(y)} \widetilde{\phi}(y,\lambda) +\lambda \widetilde{\phi}(y,\lambda)=0.
\end{equation} 

In view of \eqref{Rayleigh equation at c=0}, the homogeneous problem \eqref{homogeneous DE} can be obtained by setting $m$ to equal 0 in \eqref{Rayleigh equation at c=0}. By fixing the value for of $m$, the function $\widetilde{\phi}$ in \eqref{homogeneous DE} and the homogeneous equation itself become $m$-independent. Thanks to Lemma~\eqref{phi1 phi2} in the Appendix~\ref{Related Results}, the homogeneous differential equation \eqref{homogeneous DE} has a regular solution which takes the form $\widetilde{\phi}(y,\lambda)=U(y)\phi_1(y,\lambda)$, where 
\begin{equation}\label{phi1}
   \phi_1(y,\lambda)= 1+\int_0^{y} \dfrac{-\lambda} {U^2(w)} \int_0^{w}\phi_1(z,\lambda) U^2(z) \;dz\;dw,
\end{equation}
and it satisfies the conditions
\begin{equation}\label{boundary conditions}
\phi_1(0,\lambda)=1, \qquad \phi'_1(0,\lambda)=0. 
\end{equation} We would like to mention that, alternatively, to obtain the expression of $\phi_1$, one can solve the following differential equation

\begin{equation}\label{differential equation for phi1}
    (U^2(y) \phi'_1(y,\lambda))'=-\lambda \phi_1(y,\lambda)U^2,
\end{equation}
which is obtained by simply plugging in the ansatz $\widetilde{\phi}$ into \eqref{homogeneous DE}.

It is important to note that since $c=0$, then $\phi_2$ in Lemma~\eqref{phi1 phi2} is uniformly equal to 1. That is the reason why we do not see it in the expression of $\widetilde{\phi}$. 


As a consequence, one can check that
\begin{equation}\label{phi tilde}
    \Phi(y,\lambda):=\Xi^{-}(y,\lambda)\chi_{[-1,0)}(y)+\Xi^{+}(y,\lambda)\chi_{(0,1]}(y),
\end{equation}

with
 \begin{equation}\label{expansion}
 \begin{aligned}
 \Xi^{\mp}(y,\lambda)&:= U(y) \phi_1(y,\lambda) \int_{\mp1}^y \dfrac{1}{U^2(z)}\bigg(\dfrac{1}{\phi_1^2(z,\lambda)} -1\bigg)\;dz
                            \\ &\quad + U(y) \phi_1(y,\lambda) \int_{U(\mp1)}^{U(y)} \dfrac{(U^{-1})'(u_1)-(U^{\mp1})'(0)-(U^{-1})''(0)(u_1)}{(u_1)^2}\;du_1
                            \\ &\quad -\dfrac{U(y)\phi_1(y,\lambda)}{U'(0)U(z)}\Big|_{z=\mp1}^{z=y}
 \end{aligned}
 \end{equation}
solves the homogeneous problem \eqref{homogeneous DE} for $y \in [-1,1]\setminus \{0\}$, is continuous at $y=0$, and satisfies the boundary conditions: $\Phi(\pm 1,\lambda)=0$.

In view of the inhomogeneous differential equation \eqref{second order DE}, the function $\Phi(y,\lambda)$ \eqref{phi tilde} can be regarded as a weak solution of \eqref{second order DE} in the following sense
\begin{equation}
   -\int_{-1}^1 \Phi(y,\lambda) \varphi''(y)  + \dfrac{U''(y)}{U(y)} \Phi(y,\lambda)\varphi(y)-\lambda  \Phi(y,\lambda)\varphi(y) dy =\dfrac{m\Phi(0,\lambda)\varphi(0)}{U'(0)},
\end{equation}
for all test functions $\varphi(y)\in H^{1}_0(-1,1).$
Via integration by parts and using the fact that $\Phi$ solves the homogeneous problem away from 0, we arrive at the following equation
\[
-\partial_y \Xi^{+}(0,\lambda)+\partial_y \Xi^{-}(0,\lambda)=m\Phi(0,\lambda).
\]

Moreover, using the expression of $\Xi^{\mp}$ \eqref{expansion} and the facts that $U(0)=0,\phi_1(0,\lambda)=1$, and $\phi'_1(0,\lambda)=0$, we obtain
\[
\begin{aligned}
    \mathfrak{M}(\lambda):=m&=\dfrac{\partial_y \Xi^{-}(0,\lambda)-\partial_y \Xi^{+}(0,\lambda)}{\Phi(0,\lambda)}\\
    &=U'(0) \dfrac{\int_{-1}^{1} \dfrac{1}{U^2(y)}\bigg(\dfrac{1}{\phi^2_1(y,\lambda)}-1\bigg)\;dy}{\Phi(0,\lambda)}.
\end{aligned}
\]
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Notice that the term $\Phi(0,\lambda)$ in the denominator of $\mathfrak{M}$ can expressed as 
\[
\begin{aligned}
\Phi(0,\lambda)&=\lim_{y\to 0^-}\Xi^{-}(y,\lambda)=\dfrac{-1}{U'(0)}.
\end{aligned}
\]
Altogether, we conclude that $\mathfrak{M}$ takes the form
\begin{equation}\label{expression of m}
    \mathfrak{M}(\lambda)=-(U'(0))^2\int_{-1}^{1} \dfrac{1}{U^2(y)}\bigg(\dfrac{1}{\phi^2_1(y,\lambda)}-1\bigg)\;dy.
\end{equation}
 

Having derived the expression for the function $\mathfrak{M}$, we now continue to prove its monotonicity with respect to $\lambda$. We focus our attention into looking at how $\mathfrak{M}$ varies with respect to $\lambda$. This can be done by first differentiating \eqref{expression of m} with respect to $\lambda$. Direct computation yields
\begin{equation} \label{monotonicity of m}
\partial_{\lambda} \mathfrak{M}=-(U'(0))^2 \int_{-1}^{1} \dfrac{-2}{(U(y)\phi_1(y,\lambda))^2}\dfrac{\partial_\lambda\phi_1(y,\lambda)}{\phi_1(y,\lambda)} \;dy=:-(U'(0))^2 \text{I}.
\end{equation}
 By applying Lemma~\ref{F} to $\partial_\lambda \phi_1/\phi_1$, we infer $ -(U'(0))^2 \text{I}<0$ which, as a result, implies
\begin{equation}\label{partial lambda m}
    \partial_{\lambda}\mathfrak{M}<0.
\end{equation}
Hence, we conclude that $\mathfrak{M}$ is monotonically decreasing with respect to $\lambda$. 
\end{proof}

 In the next lemma, we derive an estimate on the distance between two minimal eigenvalues of $\mathcal{H}_{m,0}$ and $\mathcal{H}_{m,\gamma}$, respectively.


\begin{comment}
\begin{remark}
Before stating the next lemmas, we make the following two remarks: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item \label{definition 1} For each $m$, 
\[
\lambda_{m,0}=\min_{\substack{\lVert \phi\rVert_{L^2}=1 \\ \phi \in H^1_0}}(\mathcal{H}_{m,0} \phi(y),\phi(y))=:\min_{\substack{\lVert \phi\rVert_{L^2}=1 \\ \phi \in H^1_0}}H_{m,0} \phi(y),
\]
where
\begin{equation}\label{quadratic form 1}
H_{m,0}\phi(y) := \lVert \phi'(y) \rVert_{L^2}^2+\int_{-1}^1\dfrac{U''(y)}{U(y)}\phi^2(y)\; dy-\dfrac{m\phi^2(0)}{U'(0)}
\end{equation}
if and only if there is $\phi(y,m,\lambda_{m,0})$ solving \eqref{Rayleigh equation at gamma 0} with  $m=\mathfrak{M}(\lambda_{m,0})$. 

\item \label{definition 2}
For each pair $(m,\gamma)$, let 
 \[
\lambda_{m,\gamma}= \min_{\substack{\lVert \phi\rVert_{L^2}=1 \\ \phi \in H^1_0}}(\mathcal{H}_{m,\gamma} \phi(y),\phi(y))=:\min_{\substack{\lVert \phi\rVert_{L^2}=1 \\ \phi \in H^1_0}}H_{m,\gamma} \phi(y),  
 \]
 where
\begin{equation}
 H_{m,\gamma} \phi(y):=\lVert \phi'(y) \rVert_{L^2}^2 + \int_{-1}^{1} Q_{m,\gamma}(y) \phi^2(y) \; dy,
 \end{equation}
 then there is $\phi(y,m,\lambda_{m,\gamma})$ solving \eqref{weak formulation} with.
 \end{enumerate}
\end{remark}

Throughout the rest of the paper, we use $\phi(y, m,\gamma)$ to denote the corresponding eigenfunction of the minimal eigenvalue $\lambda_{m,\gamma}$. We record our estimates below.

%To emphasize this fact, we introduce $\lambda_{m,0}$ to mean $\lambda$ for fixed $m$ and $\gamma=0$. Moreover, if we go back to the Schr\"{o}diger-type operator in \eqref{Rayleigh Equation}, one can realize that at $\gamma=0$, the potential is at its strongest form. This is merely due to the presence of the delta function. For this reason,  we view $\lambda_{m,0}$ as the minimal eigenvalue of a quadratic form
\end{comment}


 
\begin{lemma}\label{distance between minimal eigenvalues} For any $m>0$ and $\gamma \neq 0$, we have
\[
|\lambda_{m,0}-\lambda_{m,\gamma}|\lesssim m\gamma.
\]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Via the quadratic forms \eqref{quadratic form 2} and \eqref{quadratic form 1}, we can infer that 
 \begin{equation}\label{inequality for distance}
 \begin{aligned}
 &\lambda_{m,0} \leq H_{m,0}\Psi(y,m,\gamma,\lambda_{m,\gamma})\\
                    &= H_{m,\gamma}\Psi(y,m,\gamma,\lambda_{m,\gamma})-\int_{-1}^{1}\Bigg(\dfrac{U''(y)}{U_{m,\gamma}(y)}-\dfrac{U''(y)}{U(y)}\Bigg)|\Psi(y,m,\gamma,\lambda_{m,\gamma})|^2\;dy\\
                    &\quad -\int_{-1}^{1} \dfrac{m}{\gamma} \sigma(y/\gamma) \dfrac{|\Psi(y,m,\gamma,\lambda_{m,\gamma})|^2}{\frac{U(y)}{y}+\gamma m \widetilde{\Gamma}(y/\gamma)/(y/\gamma)} \; dy-\dfrac{m |\Psi(0,m,\gamma,\lambda_{m,\gamma})|^2} {U'(0)} \\
                    &= \lambda_{m,\gamma}-\int_{-1}^{1}\Bigg(\dfrac{U''(y)}{U_{m,\gamma}(y)}-\dfrac{U''(y)}{U(y)}\Bigg)|\Psi(y,m,\gamma,\lambda_{m,\gamma})|^2\;dy\\
                    &\quad- m\int_{-1/\gamma}^{1/\gamma} \sigma(y) \bigg(\dfrac{\gamma y}{U(\gamma y)}|\Psi(\gamma y,m,\gamma,\lambda_{m,\gamma})|^2-\dfrac{|\Psi(0,m,\gamma,\lambda_{m,\gamma})|^2}{U'(0)}\bigg)\;dy \\&\quad -m\int_{|y| \geq 1/ \gamma} \sigma(y) \dfrac{|\Psi(0,m,\gamma,\lambda_{m,\gamma})|^2}{U'(0)}\; dy +m \int_{-1}^{1} \dfrac{\sigma(y/\gamma)y^2}{\gamma U^2(y)} \dfrac{\gamma m \widetilde{\Gamma}(y/\gamma)/(y/\gamma)|\Psi(y,m,\gamma,\lambda_{m,\gamma})|^2}{1+\frac{y}{U(y)}\gamma m \widetilde{\Gamma}(y/\gamma)/(y/\gamma)} \; dy\\
                    &=:\lambda_{m,\gamma} +S_1+S_2+S_3+S_4,
 \end{aligned}
 \end{equation}
 where $\sigma(y)=\Gamma'(y)/y$.
 Let us now take a closer look at the terms $S_1,S_2,S_3,$ and $S_4$ and derive their estimates. We begin by deriving an estimate for $|S_1|$,
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
|S_1|&\leq \int_{-1}^{1}\Bigg|\dfrac{U''(y)U(y)-U''(y)U_{m,\gamma}(y)}{U(y)U_{m,\gamma}(y)}\Bigg||\Psi(y,m,\gamma,\lambda_{m,\gamma})|^2\;dy\\&= \int_{-1}^{1}\Bigg|\dfrac{U''(y)(U(y)-U_{m,\gamma}(y))}{U(y)U_{m,\gamma}(y)}\Bigg||\Psi(y,m,\gamma,\lambda_{m,\gamma})|^2\;dy\\
         &\lesssim \int_{-1}^{1} \Bigg|\dfrac{m\gamma^2\widetilde{\Gamma}(y/\gamma)}{U_{m,\gamma}(y)}\Bigg||\Psi(y,m,\gamma,\lambda_{m,\gamma})|^2\;dy\lesssim \int_{-1}^{1} \Bigg| \dfrac{m\gamma \widetilde{\Gamma}(y/\gamma)}{y/\gamma}\Bigg||\Psi(y,m,\gamma,\lambda_{m,\gamma})|^2\;dy \lesssim m \gamma.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Next is an estimate for $|S_2|$,
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
|S_2| &\leq m \int_{-1/\gamma}^{1/\gamma} \sigma(y) \bigg|\dfrac{\gamma y}{U(\gamma y)}-\dfrac{1}{U'(0)}\bigg| |\Psi(\gamma y,m,\gamma,\lambda_{m,\gamma})|^2\;dy\\&\quad
+m \int_{-1/\gamma}^{1/\gamma} \sigma(y)\bigg||\Psi(\gamma y,m,\gamma,\lambda_{m,\gamma})|^2-|\Psi(0,m,\gamma,\lambda_{m,\gamma})|^2\bigg|\dfrac{1}{U'(0)} \;dy\\
&=:\mathbb{I}+\mathbb{II}.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Observe that
\[
\begin{aligned}
 \mathbb{I}&=m\int_{-1/\gamma}^{1/\gamma}\sigma(y) \bigg|\dfrac{\gamma y}{U(\gamma y)}-\dfrac{1}{U'(0)}\bigg| |\Psi(\gamma y,m,\gamma,\lambda_{m,\gamma})|^2\;dy \\
&\lesssim m \int_{-1/\gamma}^{1/\gamma} \dfrac{\sigma(y) |\Psi(\gamma y,m,\gamma,\lambda_{m,\gamma})|^2 \gamma^3 y^3}{\gamma y}\;dy\\
&\lesssim m \int_{-1/\gamma}^{1/ \gamma} \sigma(y) |\Psi(\gamma y,m,\gamma,\lambda_{m,\gamma})|^2 \gamma^2 y^2\;dy\lesssim m \gamma^2\lesssim m \gamma.
\end{aligned}
\] Additionally,
\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{II}&=m \int_{-1/\gamma}^{1/\gamma} \sigma(y)\bigg||\Psi(\gamma y,m,\gamma,\lambda_{m,\gamma})|^2-|\Psi(0,m,\gamma,\lambda_{m,\gamma})|^2 \bigg|\dfrac{1}{U'(0)} \;dy \\
&\lesssim m \int_{-1/\gamma}^{1/\gamma} \sigma(y) \bigg|\Psi(\gamma y,m,\gamma,\lambda_{m,\gamma})+\Psi(0,m,\gamma,\lambda_{m,\gamma}) \bigg| \bigg|\Psi(\gamma y,m,\gamma,\lambda_{m,\gamma})-\Psi(0,m,\gamma,\lambda_{m,\gamma}) \bigg|\;dy\\
        &\lesssim m  \int_{-1/\gamma}^{1/\gamma} \sigma(y) \norm{\Psi(\gamma y,m,\gamma,\lambda_{m,\gamma})}_{L^{\infty}}\dfrac{1}{\gamma y} \Bigg(\int_{0}^{\gamma y} |\Psi'(z,m,\gamma,\lambda_{m,\gamma})|\;dz\Bigg) \gamma y\; dy\\
        &\lesssim m \norm{\sigma(y)}_{L^{\infty}} \norm{\Psi(y,m,\gamma,\lambda_{m,\gamma})}_{L^{\infty}}\int_{-1/\gamma}^{1/\gamma}\dfrac{1}{\gamma y}\int_{0}^{\gamma y} \Bigg(|\Psi'(z,m,\gamma,\lambda_{m,\gamma})|\;dz\Bigg) \gamma y\; dy\\&
        \lesssim m \gamma.                                                    
\end{aligned}
\] Hence, combining the two estimates yields 
$|S_2| \lesssim m \gamma$.

Further, it is easy to see that $|S_3|$ satisfies the following inequality
\[
\begin{aligned}
|S_3|= m\bigg|\int_{|y| \geq 1/ \gamma} \sigma(y) \dfrac{|\Psi(0,m,\gamma)|^2}{U'(0)}\; dy\bigg| \lesssim m \gamma.
\end{aligned}
\]
Lastly, it remains to obtain an estimate on $|S_4|$,
\[
\begin{aligned}
|S_4|&= m \bigg|\int_{-1}^{1} \dfrac{\sigma(y/\gamma)}{\gamma} \dfrac{y^2}{U^2(y)} \dfrac{(\gamma m \widetilde{\Gamma}(y/\gamma)/(y/\gamma))}{1+\frac{y}{U(y)}\gamma m \widetilde{\Gamma}(y/\gamma)/(y/\gamma)}\; dy\bigg|\\
         &\leq m  \bigg|\int_{-1/ \gamma}^{1/ \gamma} \sigma(y) \dfrac{y^2\gamma^2}{U^2(y\gamma)} \dfrac{(\gamma m \widetilde{\Gamma}(y)/(y))}{1+\frac{y\gamma}{U(y\gamma)}\gamma m \widetilde{\Gamma}(y)/(y)}\; dy\bigg| \lesssim m \gamma \bigg|\int_{\mathbb{R}} \sigma(y) \;dy\bigg| \approx m \gamma.
\end{aligned}
\] Note that to get the estimate for $|S_4|$,  we have used the fact $\widetilde{\Gamma}(z)/(z)$ is bounded.
 Hence, we can conclude that 
\begin{equation}\label{upper bound m gamma}
\lambda_{m,0}-\lambda_{m,\gamma}\lesssim m\gamma.
\end{equation}

 The other direction of the estimate above, namely $\lambda_{m,\gamma}-\lambda_m \lesssim m \gamma$ can be derived similarly as follows:
 \begin{align*}
 \lambda_{m,\gamma} &\leq H_{m,\gamma}\Psi(y,m,\lambda_{m,0})(y)\\
                    &= H_{m,0}\Psi(y,m,\lambda_{m,0})(y)+\int_{-1}^{1}\Bigg(\dfrac{U''(y)}{U_{m,\gamma}(y)}-\dfrac{U''(y)}{U(y)}\Bigg)|\Psi(y,m,\lambda_{m,0})|^2\;dy\\
                     &\quad+\int_{-1}^{1} \dfrac{m}{\gamma} \sigma(y/\gamma) \dfrac{1}{\frac{U(y)}{y}+\gamma m \widetilde{\Gamma}(y/\gamma)/(y/\gamma)}|\Psi(y,m,\lambda_{m,0})|^2 \; dy
                    +\dfrac{m |\Psi(0,m,\lambda_{m,0})|^2} {U'(0)} \\
                    &= \lambda_{m,0}+\int_{-1}^{1}\Bigg(\dfrac{U''(y)}{U_{m,\gamma}(y)}-\dfrac{U''(y)}{U(y)}\Bigg)|\Psi(y,m,\lambda_{m,0})|^2\;dy\\
                    &+m \int_{-1/\gamma}^{1/\gamma} \sigma(y) \bigg(\dfrac{\gamma y}{U(\gamma y)}|\Psi(\gamma y,m,\lambda_{m,0})|^2-\dfrac{|\Psi(0,m,\lambda_{m,0})|^2}{U'(0)}\bigg)\;dy \\&\quad +m\int_{|y| \geq 1/ \gamma} \sigma(y) \dfrac{|\Psi(0,m,\lambda_{m,0})|^2}{U'(0)}\; dy -m \int_{-1}^{1} \dfrac{\sigma(y/\gamma)y^2}{\gamma U^2(y)}  \dfrac{\gamma m \widetilde{\Gamma}(y/\gamma)/(y/\gamma)|\Psi(y,m,\lambda_{m,0})|^2}{1+\frac{y}{U(y)}\gamma m \widetilde{\Gamma}(y/\gamma)/(y/\gamma)}\; dy\\
                    &=:\lambda_{m,0} +\widetilde{S}_1+\widetilde{S}_2+\widetilde{S}_3+\widetilde{S}_4.
 \end{align*}
 As before, we can also obtain the bounds for all $\widetilde{S}_i$ for $i=1,2,3,4$, which eventually lead to the inequality 
 \begin{equation}\label{lower bound m gamma}
     \lambda_{m,\gamma}-\lambda_{m,0}\lesssim m \gamma.
 \end{equation} Finally, combining both estimates in \eqref{upper bound m gamma} and \eqref{lower bound m gamma} yields
 \begin{equation}\label{distance between eigenvalues}
      |\lambda_{m,0}-\lambda_{m,\gamma}|\lesssim m \gamma.
 \end{equation}
 The proof is then complete. \qedhere
\end{proof}

In addition to the estimate in Lemma~\ref{distance between minimal eigenvalues}, we also need a monotonicity property of the minimal eigenvalues of both operators $\mathcal{H}_{\widetilde{m},\gamma}$ and $\mathcal{H}_{\bar{m},\gamma}$ for $0<\widetilde{m}<\bar{m}$. This is the content of the next lemma. 
\begin{lemma}\label{monotonicity of lambda m gamma}
For any $0<\widetilde{m} <\bar{m}$ and $\gamma>0$, we have
\[
\lambda_{\bar{m},\gamma}-\lambda_{\widetilde{m},\gamma}<0.
\]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
      Via the quadratic form \eqref{quadratic form 2}, we deduce the following inequality
 \begin{equation}\label{lambda m tilde gamma}
 \begin{aligned}
     \lambda_{\bar{m},\gamma} &\leq \lVert \Psi'(y,\widetilde{m},\gamma) \rVert_{L^2}^2 + \int_{-1}^{1} Q_{\bar{m},\gamma} |\Psi(y,\widetilde{m},\gamma)|^2   \; dy\\
     &=\lambda_{\widetilde{m},\gamma}+\int_{-1}^1\bigg(\dfrac{U''_{\bar{m},\gamma}(y)}{U_{\bar{m},\gamma}(y)}-\dfrac{U''_{\widetilde{m},\gamma}(y)}{U_{\widetilde{m},\gamma}(y)}\bigg)|\Psi(y,\widetilde{m},\gamma)|^2  \; dy.
 \end{aligned}
 \end{equation}
 
 Let us focus on the integrand on the right hand side of \eqref{lambda m tilde gamma}. Notice that $\Psi^2(y,\bar{m},\gamma)$ is positive. Therefore, it suffices to check the sign of the remaining term in the integrand, that is $Q_{\bar{m},\gamma}(y)-Q_{\widetilde{m},\gamma}(y)$. We claim that this difference is strictly negative. This is equivalent to proving the derivative of $Q_{m,\gamma}(y)$ with respect to $y$ is uniformly bounded above by a negative constant. Indeed, via standard computations, we obtain
 \begin{equation}
 \begin{aligned}
     \partial_m(\dfrac{U''_{m,\gamma}(y)}{U_{m,\gamma}(y)})&=\dfrac{U(y)\Gamma'(y/\gamma)-U''(y)\gamma^2 \widetilde{\Gamma}(y/\gamma)}{U^2_{m,\gamma}(y)}= \dfrac{U(y)y\bigg(\frac{\Gamma'(y/\gamma)
}{y}-\frac{U''(y)}{U(y)}\gamma^2\frac{1}{y}\widetilde{\Gamma}(y/\gamma)\bigg)}{U^2_{m,\gamma}(y)}\\
&\lesssim \bigg(\dfrac{-C_0}{\gamma}+C_{1}\gamma^2 \lVert \Gamma \rVert_{L^{\infty}}\bigg) \lesssim \dfrac{-C_0}{\gamma}
 \end{aligned}
 \end{equation}
 for $\gamma$ small enough. Thus, $\partial_m(\dfrac{U''_{m,\gamma}}{U_{m,\gamma}})<0$ which then implies
 \[
 \bigg(\dfrac{U''_{\bar{m},\gamma}}{U_{\bar{m},\gamma}}-\dfrac{U''_{\widetilde{m},\gamma}}{U_{\widetilde{m},\gamma}}\bigg)<0.
 \]
 This inequality in concert with the one in \eqref{lambda m tilde gamma} lead us to
 \begin{equation}\label{inequality lambda m gamma}
     \lambda_{\bar{m},\gamma}-\lambda_{\widetilde{m},\gamma}<0.
 \end{equation}
 This completes the proof. \qedhere
\end{proof}

In the next three remarks, we provide more discussions on the Wronskian. 
\begin{remark}
We would like to mention that we have an explicit formula for the Wronskian for $c \in \mathfrak{B} \cap \mathfrak{D}_{\epsilon_0}\setminus \mathbb{R}$. Observe that we obtain a representation formula for each $\varphi^{-}$ and $\varphi^{+}$ mentioned in \eqref{wronskian of generic varphi}
\[
\begin{aligned} \label{varphis}
  &\varphi^{-}(y,m,c,\lambda)=\phi(-1,m,c,\lambda)\phi(y,m,c,\lambda) \int_{-1}^{y} \dfrac{1}{\phi^2(z,m,c,\lambda)}dz,\\
  &\varphi^{+}(y,m,c,\lambda)=\phi(1,m,c,\lambda)\phi(y,m,c,\lambda) \int_{1}^{y} \dfrac{1}{\phi^2(z,m,c,\lambda)}dz,
\end{aligned}
\]
where $\phi(y,m,c,\lambda)$ is defined  as in Lemma \ref{phi1 phi2}. It is also not hard to see that  $\varphi^{-}$ and $\varphi^{+}$ satisfy the boundary conditions \eqref{boundary conditions for varphi}.
By \eqref{wronskian of generic varphi}, we know that the Wronskian of $\varphi^{-}$ and  $\varphi^{+}$ is given by
\begin{equation}\label{wronskian of varphi}
\mathcal{W}[\varphi^{-},\varphi^{+}](m,\gamma,c,\lambda)= \phi(-1,m,c,\lambda)\phi(1,m,c,\lambda) \int_{-1}^{1} \dfrac{1}{\phi^2(y,m,c,\lambda)}\;dy.
\end{equation}
\end{remark}

 One can verify from the definition of $\phi(y,m,c,\lambda)$ that both terms $\phi(-1,m,c,\lambda)$ and $\phi(1,m,c,\lambda)$ in the Wronskian $\mathcal{W}$ are away from zero for all $c\in \mathfrak{B} \cap \mathfrak{D}_{\epsilon_0}\setminus \mathbb{R}$. This leads us to state the next remark.
\begin{remark}\label{equivalent condition for c eval and wronskian being 0}
    Let $c\in \mathfrak{B} \cap \mathfrak{D}_{\epsilon_0}\setminus \mathbb{R}$. the constant $c$ is an eigenvalue of operator $\mathcal{R}_{m,\gamma,k}$ \eqref{operator R} if and only if 
    \[
    W(m,\gamma,c,\lambda):=\int_{-1}^{1} \dfrac{1}{\phi^2(y,m,\gamma,c,\lambda)}\;dy=0.
    \]
More precisely, this gives us a criterion to decide whether or not $c$ is an eigenvalue of $\mathcal{R}_{m,\gamma,k}$. That is to say one only needs to check if $W$ is zero at $c$. For the rest of the paper $W$ will be called ``modified Wronskian".

 One may observe that the Wronskian $\mathcal{W}$ and modified Wronskian $W$ share the same zeros. However, it is important to note that although  $\mathcal{W}[\varphi^{-},\varphi^{+}](m,\gamma,c,\lambda)=\varphi^{-}(1,m,\gamma,c,\lambda)$ is analytic in $c$, the modified Wronskian $W$ may not be so for some $c$. Therefore, when the analyticity  is needed in our argument, we shall work with $\mathcal{W}$, otherwise it suffices to only work with the modified Wronskian $W$.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}\label{continuity of wronskian}
    It is proved in \cite[Lemma 6.3]{WeiZhangZhao2015} (also see \cite{limasmoudizhao2022}) that for any given $m,\gamma$ (namely fixed shear flow) and $\lambda$, the Wronskian $\mathcal{W}[\varphi^{-},\varphi^{+}](m,\gamma,c,\lambda)$ is one-sided continuous to the boundary $\mathrm{Ran}\, U_{m,\gamma}$ from both $\mathfrak{Im}\, c>0$ and $\mathfrak{Im}\, c<0$. Namely, there are real functions $A(m,\mathfrak{Re}\,c,\lambda)$ and $B(m,\mathfrak{Re}\,c,\lambda)$ such that 
    \begin{align*}
    \lim_{\mathfrak{Im}\, c\to 0_{\pm}}
    \mathcal{W}[\varphi^{-},\varphi^{+}](1,m,\gamma,c,\lambda)
    =A(m,\gamma,\mathfrak{Re}\,c,\lambda)\mp iB(m,\gamma,\mathfrak{Re}\,c,\lambda)
    \end{align*}
    where 
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{aligned}
        &B(m,\gamma, \mathfrak{Re}\,c,\lambda)\\
        &=\frac{U''_{m,\gamma}(U^{-1}_{m,\gamma}(\mathfrak{Re}\, c))}{U'_{m,\gamma}(U^{-1}_{m,\gamma}(\mathfrak{Re}\, c))^3}(U_{m,\gamma}(-1)-\mathfrak{Re}\, c)(U_{m,\gamma}(1)-\mathfrak{Re}\, c)\phi_1(1,m,\mathfrak{Re}\, c,\lambda)\phi_1(-1,m,\mathfrak{Re}\,c,\lambda)
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation*}
    It is easy to check that $B(m,0,\lambda)=0$, which means that $\mathcal{W}[\varphi^{-},\varphi^{+}](1,m,c,\lambda)$ is continuous at $0$. 

    In the same paper \cite{WeiZhangZhao2015}, the authors also proved the following statement:
    The pure imaginary number $ik c$ with $0\neq k\in \mathbb{Z}$ and $c\in \mathrm{Ran}\, U_{m,\gamma}$ is an embedded eigenvalue of the Rayleigh operator namely, the Rayleigh equation \eqref{Rayleigh Equation} with $c\in \mathrm{Ran}\, U_{m,\gamma}$, has nontrivial solutions, if and only if
    \begin{equation}
        A(m,c,-k^2)^2+B(m,c,-k^2)^2=0.
    \end{equation}
\end{remark}
Having established the tools and machinery for our argument, we now present our proofs. 
\section{Proofs}\label{proof of main results}
This section is devoted to proving both Theorems~\ref{linear} and \ref{nonlinear}. It consists of two folds. The first part is composed of a sequence of proof, each corresponds to the regime when $m<m_*, m=m_*,$ and $m>m_*$. Following that would be the proof of Theorem~\ref{nonlinear}.

Let us now establish a simple yet crucial fact for our proofs. Recall in \eqref{expression of m}, we know that for a given $\lambda$, one can find $m$ such that $\lambda$ is the corresponding minimal eigenvalue of $\mathcal{H}_{m,0}$. Let $\lambda_{m_0,0}=-1$ be the minimal eigenvalue of $\mathcal{H}_{m_0,0}$ (in other words for $m=m_0$). We shall use this fact as a building block in our arguments.

%%%PROOF OF THEOREM 1.1 b
We are now in the position of proving Theorem~\ref{linear}~\ref{Neutral mode}.
\begin{proof}[\textbf{Proof of Theorem~\ref{linear}\ref{Neutral mode}}]
By using inequality \eqref{distance between eigenvalues} we have just derived, for $m=m_0$, there exists $\gamma_0>0$ such that 
\[
|\lambda_{m_0,\gamma}-\lambda_{m_0,0}|\lesssim m_0 \gamma,
\] 
for all $\gamma \in (0,\gamma_0)$.

Let $\gamma_* \in (0,\gamma_0)$. Thanks to the expression of $m$ in \eqref{expression of m} and its monotonicity in  \eqref{partial lambda m} , there exists $m=m_1$ such that $\lambda_{m_1,0}<-1-Cm_1\gamma_*$ with $m_1>m_0$. Moreover, via inequality \eqref{distance between eigenvalues}, we know that 
\[
\lambda_{m_1,\gamma_*}\leq Cm_1\gamma_* +\lambda_{m_1,0}<-1.
\]
By similar argument, let $m_2<m_0$. Again, using the formula of $m$ in \eqref{expression of m} and the monotonicity of $m$ in \eqref{partial lambda m}, we can choose $m=m_2$, such that $\lambda_{m_2,0}>-1+Cm_2\gamma_*$. Further, via inequality \eqref{distance between eigenvalues} we have
\[
\lambda_{m_2,\gamma_*}\geq \lambda_{m_2,0}-Cm_2\gamma_*>-1. 
\]
Since, $\lambda_{m_2,\gamma_*}>-1$ and $\lambda_{m_1,\gamma_*}<-1$, then there exists $m=m_*$ such that $m_1>m_*>m_2$ and
\[
\lambda_{m_*,\gamma_*}=-1.
\]
This implies that $c=0$ is the an embedded eigenvalue of the Rayleigh operator. Since there is no other inflection point of $U_{m_*,\gamma_*}$ apart from $y=0$, then $c=0$ is the only embedded eigenvalue of $\mathcal{L}_{m_*,\gamma_*}$. This proves part\ref{Neutral mode}.
\end{proof}
Next, we prove part~\ref{Stability} of Theorem~\ref{linear}. 
\begin{proof}[\textbf{Proof of Theorem~\ref{linear}\ref{Stability}}]
Observe that for any $m<m_*$, where $m_*$ is the one mentioned before, we have
\begin{equation} \label{spectra condition for m<m_*}
\lambda_{m,\gamma_*}>-1=\lambda_{m_*,\gamma_*}.
\end{equation}
But we know that $-k^2\leq-1$ which means  $c=0$ cannot be an embedded eigenvalue of $\mathcal{R}_{m,\gamma,k}$ for $m<m_*$. Via Lemma~\ref{monotonicity of lambda m gamma}, the nonexistence of embedded eigenvalue also holds true for any $m<m_*$ and $\gamma\in (0,\gamma_0)$. 

%Howard's semicircle theorem \cite{Howard1961} tells us that it is possible for eigenvalues of the operator \eqref{operator R} to be located outside the range of $U_{m,\gamma_*}$. More precisely, the theorem confirms that such eigenvalue (if exists) should lie on the semicircle $S$ on the Complex plane. However, we claim that no eigenvalue exists on the semicircle $S$ for the parameter regime we consider here.

To that end, we look at the following Rayleigh equation for $k\neq 0$,
\begin{equation}\label{RE}
\Big(U_{m,\gamma_*}-c\Big)(\partial^2_y-k^2)\phi-U''_{m,\gamma_*} \phi=0.
\end{equation} We would like to note again that for $k>C_0$, where $C_0$ some generic constant, the Wronskian $\mathcal{W}(m,\gamma_*,c,-k^2) \neq 0$ for all $c$. Hence, one can apply the same argument below even for all $C_0>|k|\geq 1$.  We show that the Rayleigh equation contains no nontrivial solution $\phi\in H^1_0(-1,1).$ This is equivalent to proving that the Wronskian $\mathcal{W}(m,\gamma_*,c,-k^2)\neq 0$. %assuming $\varphi_1$ and $\varphi_2$ are solutions of \eqref{RE} with $\varphi_1(-1)=\varphi_2(1)=0$ and $\varphi'_1(-1)=\varphi'_2(1)=1$. 

Suppose that \eqref{RE} has a nontrivial solution for some $c$. We define the following set $\mathcal{M}_k$ and its infimum
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{M}_k:&=\{m: \exists\, c \in S\setminus R,\  \mathcal{W}(m,\gamma_*,c,-k^2)=0\}
, \quad m_{k,\infty}:=\inf_{m\in \mathcal{M}_k}m,
\end{align*}
where $R=\bigcup\limits_{m<m_*}[U_{m,\gamma_*}(-1),U_{m,\gamma_*}(1)]=\mathrm{Ran}\, U_{m,\gamma_*}$ and
$$
S=\left\{c\in \mathbb{C}:~\mathrm{dist}\,(c,R)\leq d_0\right\},
$$
with \[d_0=\sup\limits_{m<m_*}\frac{U_{m,\gamma_*}(1)-U_{m,\gamma_*}(-1)}{2}.\]
Note that $\mathcal{W}(m,\gamma_*,c,-k^2)\neq 0$ for $c\notin S$ for all $k$.

Since $\mathcal{M}_k=\emptyset$ for large $k$, we only focus on a finite number of $k$'s. The following argument can be done for each $k$. So we drop the $k$ in the notations and let $\mathcal{W}(m,c)=\mathcal{W}(m,\gamma_*,c,-k^2)$, $W(m,\gamma_*,c)=W(m,\gamma_*,c,-k^2)$,  $\mathcal{M}=\mathcal{M}_k$, and $m_{\infty}=m_{k,\infty}$ for convenience. 
Our strategy is to show that $\mathcal{M}$ is open and closed in the natural topology. As a consequence, it has to be either the empty set or the whole real line. The later one cannot be true since $0\notin \mathcal{M}$, hence it has to be empty. 

Let us start by showing the open property of $\mathcal{M}$. This can be done by proving that for any $m\in \mathcal{M}$, there exists a $\delta>0$ such that for all $x \in B_{\delta}(m)$ we have $x \in \mathcal{M}$.
By way of contradiction, we suppose that $\mathcal{M}$ is not open. Then there is $m\in\mathcal{M}$, such that for all $\delta>0$ there exists $x \in B_{\delta}(m)$ such that $x \notin \mathcal{M}$. Let $c_0$ be one zero of $\mathcal{W}(m,\gamma_*,c)$. Next we focus on the closed neighbourhood of $c_0$: $N_{\delta_1}(c_0)=\{z\in S\setminus R:~\mathrm{dist}(c_0,z)\leq \delta_1\}$ with $\delta_1$ fixed depending on $m$. Since $x\notin \mathcal{M}$, we have $\mathcal{W}(x,\gamma_*,c) \neq 0$ for all $c \in N_{\delta_1}(c_0)$. By the continuity of $\mathcal{W}(x,\gamma_*,c)$ in $c$, there exists a constant $C(x)>\epsilon>0$, such that $|\mathcal{W}(x,\gamma_*,c)|>C(x)$. By the continuity of $\mathcal{W}(x,\gamma_*,c)$ in $x$, it holds that there is $\epsilon_1$ such that for all $|x-m|<\epsilon_1$, 
\[
\begin{aligned}
   |\mathcal{W}(m,\gamma_*,c)-\mathcal{W}(x,\gamma_*,c)|\leq \epsilon/2<|\mathcal{W}(x,\gamma_*,c)|\quad \text{for} \quad x\in N_{\delta_1}(c_0).
\end{aligned}
\] 
However, by Rouche's theorem, we know that the number of zeros of $\mathcal{W}(m,\gamma_*,c)$ is equal to that of $\mathcal{W}(x,\gamma_*,c)$ in $N_{\delta_1}(c_0)$. However, $c_0$ is a zero of $\mathcal{W}(m,\gamma_*,c)$, but $W(x,\gamma_*,c) \neq 0$ in $N_{\delta_1}(c_0)$. Hence, we arrive at a contradiction. This proves that $\mathcal{M}$ has to be open.

It remains, therefore, to show that $\mathcal{M}$ is closed. Consider the sequence $\{(c_n,m_n)\}$ with 
\[\mathcal{W}(m_n,\gamma_*,c_n)=0=W(m_n,\gamma_*,c_n).
\] Recycling the same notation, there is a subsequence denoted by $(c_n,m_n)$ such that $(c_n,m_n) \to (c_\infty, m_{\infty})$ as $n\to \infty$. Since we are studying the limit of the subsequence $c_n$ to a real number, it suffices to only work with $c_n \in \mathfrak{B}\cap \mathfrak{D}_{\epsilon_0}$. This allows us to use the Wronskian $\mathcal{W}$. We claim that  $c_\infty$ does not belong to $R$. This then allows us to say that $c_\infty$ must belong to $S \setminus R$.

By way of contradiction, suppose that $c_{\infty} \in R$. Recall that, via the result in Lemma~\ref{phi1 phi2}, we know that the Rayleigh equation \eqref{RE} admits a regular solution of the form
    \[
     \phi(y,m,\gamma_*,c_n)=(U_{m,\gamma_*}(y)-c_n){\phi}_1(y,m,\gamma_*,\mathfrak{Re}c_n)\phi_2(y,m,\gamma_*,c_n). 
    \]
    We also would like to mention the following identity:
    \[
    \begin{aligned}
        &\lim_{(m_n,c_n)\to(m_\infty,c_\infty)}\mathcal{W}(m_n,\gamma_*,c_n)=\lim_{c_n\to c_\infty}\lim_{m_n\to m_\infty}\mathcal{W}(m_n,\gamma_*,c_n)\\&
        =\lim_{c_n\to c_\infty}\mathcal{W}(m_\infty,\gamma_*,c_n).
    \end{aligned}
    \]
    For fixed $m=m_\infty$, by Remark~\ref{continuity of wronskian}, we know that 
    \[
    \mathcal{W}(m_\infty,\gamma,c,\lambda)\to A(m_\infty,\gamma_*,c_\infty)\pm iB(m_\infty,\gamma_*,c_\infty),\quad \text{as } \mathfrak{Im}\; c_{n}\to 0. 
    \]
    However, due to the continuity of $\mathcal{W}$ with respect to $c$ and the fact that $\mathcal{W}(m_n,c_n)=0$, we have $\mathcal{W}(m_\infty,c_\infty)=0$. This implies that
    \[
    A^2(m_{\infty},\gamma_*,c_\infty)+B^2(m_{\infty},\gamma_*,c_\infty)=0.
    \]
    By the limit identity above, we conclude that 
    \[
    \lim_{c_n\to c_\infty}\mathcal{W}(m_\infty,\gamma_*,c_n)=0.
    \]
    Hence, $c_\infty$ must be an embedded eigenvalue of the operator $\mathcal{R}_{m_\infty,\gamma_*,c_\infty}$. This contradicts the fact that the operator $\mathcal{R}_{m,\gamma_*,c}$ has no embedded eigenvalue for $m<m_*$. Hence, $c_\infty \notin R$. Hence, $c_{\infty} \in S\setminus R$. Therefore, $\mathcal{M}$ must be  closed. Using the openness and closedness property of $\mathcal{M}$ along with the fact that $0\notin \mathcal{M}$, we conclude that $\mathcal{M}$ has to be empty. The proof is now complete.\qedhere
\end{proof}
 
\begin{proof}[\textbf{Proof of Theorem~\ref{linear}\ref{Instability}}]
Next, we prove the existence of growing mode  in Theorem~\ref{linear}\ref{Instability}.
From the proof of Theorem~\ref{linear}~\ref{Neutral mode}, we know that  there exist $m_*$ and $\gamma_*$ such that $\lambda_{m_*,\gamma_*}=-1$ with $c=0$ being an embedded eigenvalue of the operator $\mathcal{R}_{m_*,\gamma_*,1}$. By virtue of Remark~\ref{equivalent condition for c eval and wronskian being 0}, this is equivalent to saying that
\[
W(m_*,\gamma_*,0,-1)=0.
\]
Let $c=ic_i$ with $c_i\neq 0$. To show the existence of an unstable mode of the Rayleigh operator $\mathcal{L}_{m,\gamma}$ for $m>>m_*$, it suffices to show that $\partial_{c_i}W(m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)$ is bounded above and below.
Since $\mathcal{W}$ is analytic in $c$, then if we translate the parameter $m$ to the right (slightly larger), we expect the emergence of a purely imaginary eigenvalue $i c_i$ of the operator $\mathcal{R}_{m,\gamma,k}$.
To keep our notation simpler, we define the coupling between $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ as follows
\[
\phi_1^{E}(y,m,\gamma,c,\lambda):=\phi_1(y,m,\gamma,c_r,\lambda)\phi_2(y,m,\gamma,c,\lambda),
\]
where $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ are as stated in Lemma~\ref{phi1 phi2}.
Hence, the modified Wronskian takes the form
 \begin{equation}\label{modified wronskian at cr 0}
     W(m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)=\underbrace{\int_{-1}^1\dfrac{1}{(U_{m,\gamma}(y)-ic_i)^2}\;dy}_{\text{I}} + \underbrace{\int_{-1}^1\dfrac{1}{(U_{m,\gamma}(y)-ic_i)^2} \Bigg( \dfrac{1}{(\phi_1^E)^2(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)}-1\Bigg)\;dy}_{\text{II}}.
\end{equation}
With this in mind, we begin the proof by estimating $\partial_{c_i}\text{I}$ and $\partial_{c_i}\text{II}$. Notice that \text{I} can be recast as
\[
\begin{aligned}
\text{I}&=\int_{U_{m,\gamma}(-1)}^{U_{m,\gamma}(1)}\dfrac{\partial_v(U_{m,\gamma}^{-1})(v)}{(v-ic_i)^2}\;dv=\dfrac{2}{U_{m,\gamma}(1)U'_m(1)}+\int_{U_{m,\gamma}(-1)}^{U_{m,\gamma}(1)}\dfrac{\partial^2_v(U_{m,\gamma}^{-1})(v)}{(v-ic_i)}\;dv\\
        &=\dfrac{2}{U_{m,\gamma}(1)U'_m(1)}+\int_{U_{m,\gamma}(-1)}^{U_{m,\gamma}(1)}\dfrac{v\partial^2_v(U_{m,\gamma}^{-1})(v)}{(v^2+c_i^2)}+\dfrac{ic_i\partial^2_v(U_{m,\gamma}^{-1})(v)}{(v^2+c_i^2)}\;dv.
\end{aligned}
\]
Hence, differentiating with respect to $c_i$ yields
\[
\begin{aligned}
    \partial_{c_i}\text{I}&= \partial_{c_i}\int_{U_{m,\gamma}(-1)}^{U_{m,\gamma}(1)}\dfrac{v\partial^2_v(U_{m,\gamma}^{-1})(v)}{(v^2+c_i^2)}+\dfrac{ic_i\partial^2_v(U_{m,\gamma}^{-1})(v)}{(v^2+c_i^2)}\;dv\\
               &=:\partial_{c_i}\text{I}_1+\partial_{c_i}\text{I}_2,
\end{aligned}
\]               
where       
\[
\partial_{c_i}\text{I}_1=\int_{U_{m,\gamma}(-1)}^{U_{m,\gamma}(1)}\partial_{v}\Bigg(\dfrac{c_i}{(v^2+c_i^2)}\Bigg)\partial^2_v(U_{m,\gamma}^{-1})(v)\;dv,
\]
and 
\[
\partial_{c_i}\text{I}_2=-i\int_{U_{m,\gamma}(-1)}^{U_{m,\gamma}(1)}\partial_v\Bigg(\dfrac{ v}{(v^2+c_i^2)}\Bigg)\partial^2_v(U_{m,\gamma}^{-1})(v))\;dv.
\]
One may observe that for $c_i>0$,
\[
\begin{aligned}  &|\partial_{c_i}\text{I}_1+\pi\partial_v^3(U^{-1}_{m,\gamma})(0)|\\&\leq \int_{|v|\leq K_0c_i}\bigg|\dfrac{c_i}{v^2+c_i^2}\bigg(\partial^3_v(U_{m,\gamma}^{-1})(v)-\partial^3_v(U_{m,\gamma}^{-1})(0)\bigg)\bigg|\;dv+\int_{|v|\geq K_0c_i}\bigg|\dfrac{c_i}{v^2+c_i^2}\partial^3_v(U_{m,\gamma}^{-1})(0)\bigg|\;dv\\&
    \qquad +\int_{|v|\geq K_0c_i}\bigg|\dfrac{c_i}{v^2+c_i^2}\partial^3_v(U_{m,\gamma}^{-1})(v)\bigg|\;dv +\bigg|\dfrac{c_iU''_{m,\gamma}(y)}{(U^2_{m,\gamma}(y)+c_i^2)(U'_{m,\gamma}(y))^3}\Big|_{y=-1}^{1}\bigg|\\&
    \leq \bigg(\int_{|v|\leq K_0c_i}|\dfrac{c_i}{v^2+c_i^2}v|^2\;dv\bigg)^{1/2} \bigg(\int_{|v|\leq K_0c_i} |\partial^4_v(U_{m,\gamma}^{-1})(v)|^2\;dv\bigg)^{1/2}+C\Big|\frac{\pi}{2}-\arctan(K_0)\Big|\frac{1}{\gamma}\\&
    \qquad 
    +\bigg|\dfrac{c_iU''_{m,\gamma}(y)}{(U^2_{m,\gamma}(y)+c_i^2)(U'_{m,\gamma}(y))^3}\Big|_{y=-1}^{1}\bigg|\\
    &\leq C|K_0c_i|^{\frac12}\gamma^{-\frac{3}{2}}+C\Big|\frac{\pi}{2}-\arctan(K_0)\Big|\frac{1}{\gamma}+C|c_i|.
\end{aligned}
\]
By taking $K_0$ large enough, we have for $c_i<\epsilon_0(K_0)\gamma$ that
\begin{equation}
   C^{-1}\gamma^{-1}\leq |\partial_{c_i}\text{I}_1|\leq C\gamma^{-1}.
\end{equation}
Next, we shall derive an estimate for $\partial_{c_i}\text{I}_2$. Thanks to Lemma~\ref{Supremum estimate}, we can infer that
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
       |\partial_{c_i}\text{I}_2| &\lesssim \lVert \partial^3_v(U_{m,\gamma}^{-1})  \rVert^{1/2}_{L^2}\bigg(\lVert \partial^4_v(U_{m,\gamma}^{-1})  \rVert^{1/2}_{L^2}+ \lVert \partial^3_v(U_{m,\gamma}^{-1})  \rVert_{L^\infty}^{\frac{1}{2}} \bigg)\\
     &\lesssim(\dfrac{1}{\gamma^{1/2}})^{1/2}\bigg((\dfrac{1}{\gamma^{3/2}})^{1/2}+(\dfrac{1}{\gamma})^{\frac{1}{2}}\bigg)\lesssim \dfrac{1}{\gamma}.  
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

%As $c_i \to 0_+$,
%\[
%\partial_{c_i}\text{I}\to \pi\bigg(\dfrac{-U'''_m}{(U'_m)^4}\bigg)\bigg|_{y=0}+ i\bigg(\mathcal{H}(\partial^3_v(U_{m,\gamma}^{-1}))(0)\bigg) ,
%\]
%where $\mathcal{H}$ is the Hilbert transform.

To obtain the bounds for $\partial_{c_i}\text{II}$, we first define the so-called ``good" derivative
\begin{equation}\label{good derivative}
    \partial_G:=\bigg(\partial_{c_i}+i\dfrac{\partial_y}{U_{m,\gamma}'(0)}\bigg).
\end{equation}
With this in mind, in terms of the good derivative we can express $\partial_{c_i}$ as follows
\[
 \partial_{c_i}:=\partial_G -i\dfrac{\partial_y}{U_{m,\gamma}'(0)}.
\]

Hence, we obtain
\[
\begin{aligned}
\partial_{c_i}\text{II}&= \int_{-1}^1 \partial_G \Bigg(\dfrac{1}{(U_{m,\gamma}-ic_i)^2} \bigg( \dfrac{1}{(\phi_1^E)^2(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)}-1\bigg)\Bigg)\;dy\\
                       & \qquad -i\int_{-1}^1 \dfrac{\partial_y}{U_{m,\gamma}'(0)}\Bigg( \dfrac{1}{(U_{m,\gamma}-ic_i)^2} \bigg( \dfrac{1}{(\phi_1^E)^2(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)}-1\bigg)\Bigg)\;dy\\
                       &=\underbrace{\int_{-1}^1\bigg( \dfrac{1}{(\phi_1^E)^2(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)}-1\bigg)\Bigg[\partial_G \bigg( \dfrac{1}{(U_{m,\gamma}-ic_i)^2} \bigg)\Bigg]\;dy}_{\text{II}'_1}\\
                       &\qquad + \underbrace{\int_{-1}^1\bigg( \dfrac{1}{(U_{m,\gamma}-ic_i)^2} \bigg)\Bigg[\partial_G \bigg( \dfrac{1}{(\phi_1^E)^2(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)}-1\bigg)\Bigg]\;dy}_{\text{II}'_2}\\
                       &\qquad -i\dfrac{1}{U'_m(0)}\Bigg( \dfrac{1}{(U_{m,\gamma}-ic_i)^2} \bigg( \dfrac{1}{(\phi_1^E)^2(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)}-1\bigg)\Bigg)\Bigg|_{-1}^{1}.
\end{aligned}
\]
Observe that the boundary term on the last line above is finite. Therefore,
\[
\bigg| \dfrac{1}{U'_m(0)}\Bigg( \dfrac{1}{(U_{m,\gamma}-ic_i)^2} \bigg(\dfrac{1}{(\phi_1^E)^2(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)}-1\bigg)\Bigg)\bigg|_{-1}^{1}\bigg| < C.
\]
Let us now look at $\text{II}'_1$. Observe for a moment that 
\[
\bigg|\partial_G \bigg( \dfrac{1}{(U_{m,\gamma}-ic_i)^2}\bigg)\bigg|=\bigg|\dfrac{2\bigg(-i+i\dfrac{U'_{m,\gamma}(y)}{U'_{m,\gamma}(0)}\bigg)}{(U_{m,\gamma}(y)-ic_i)^3}\bigg|\leq C\dfrac{\lVert U''_{m,\gamma}(y)\rVert_{L^{\infty}_y}}{y^2+(c_i)^2}.
\] The quadratic singularity of $\partial_G(1/(U_{m,\gamma}-ic_i)^2)$ can be cancelled by the two zeros of $(1-(\phi_1^E)^2)$. That is to say, the integral $\text{II}'_1$ is well-defined. Again, using the uniform estimates for $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ in Lemma~\ref{phi1 phi2}, we conclude that $|\text{II}'_1|$ is uniformly bounded by a constant independent of $m,\gamma$ and $c_i$:
\[
|\text{II}'_1|\leq C.
\]
Next, we shall show, similarly, that  $\text{II}'_2$ is also uniformly bounded by a constant independent of $m,\gamma,c_i$. We begin by obtaining an estimate for $\partial_G((1-(\phi_1^E)^2)/(\phi_1^E)^2)$ which explicitly (after an expansion) reads
\[
\begin{aligned}
\partial_G(\dfrac{1}{(\phi_1^E)^2(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)}-1)&=\dfrac{-2\partial_G\phi_1^E(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)}{(\phi_1^E)^3(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)}\\&
=\dfrac{-2\partial_G\phi_1^E(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)}{(\phi_1^E(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1))}\dfrac{1}{(\phi_1^E)^2(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)}.
\end{aligned}
\]
But, by Lemma~\ref{phi1 phi2} and Lemma~\ref{partial G phi1}, we deduce that 
\[
\bigg|\partial_G(\dfrac{1}{(\phi_1^E)^2(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)}-1)\bigg|=\bigg|\dfrac{-2\partial_G\phi_1^E(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)}{(\phi_1^E(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1))}\dfrac{1}{(\phi_1^E)^2(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)}\bigg|\leq C y^2,
\]
where again $C$ is independent of $m,c,\gamma$. Therefore, we have
\[
|\text{II}'_2|\leq C \int_{-1}^{1}\dfrac{y^2}{y^2+(c_i)^2}\;dy\leq C.
\]

\end{comment}
\begin{comment}
Let us start with the second term: $\mathfrak{E}_1^2$. The boundedness of this term is mainly a consequence of Lemma~\ref{Supremum estimate}. It is sufficient to show that \[
f:=\partial_y\bigg(\frac{1}{U_{m,\gamma}'(y)} \partial_y(\frac{1}{\phi^2_1(y)})\bigg)\in H^{1}_y.
\] Direct computation yields
\[
f=\dfrac{2U_{m,\gamma}(y)\phi'_1(y)}{(U'_{m,\gamma}(y))^2\phi^3_1(y)}+\frac{1}{U_{m,\gamma}'(y)} \bigg(\dfrac{-2\phi''_1(y)}{\phi^3_1(y)}+\dfrac{6(\phi'_1)^2(y)}{(\phi_1(y))^4}\bigg)
\] Using the bounds found in Lemma~\ref{phi1 phi2} of Appendix~\ref{Related Results}, it is straightforward to see that $f\in L^2_y$. Similarly, upon differentiating $f$ in $y$ gives us
\[
\begin{aligned}
    \partial_y f&=\bigg(\dfrac{2U_{m,\gamma}(y)\phi'_1(y)}{(U'_{m,\gamma}(y))^2\phi^3_1(y)}\bigg)_y-\dfrac{U''_{m,\gamma}(y)}{(U'_{m,\gamma}(y))^2}\bigg(\dfrac{-2\phi''_1(y)}{\phi^3_1(y)}+\dfrac{6(\phi'_1(y))^2}{(\phi_1(y))^4}\bigg)\\&
    \qquad+ \dfrac{1}{U'_{m,\gamma}(y)}\bigg(\dfrac{-2\phi''_1(y)}{\phi^3_1(y)}+\dfrac{18\phi'_1(y)\phi''_1(y)}{\phi^4_1(y)}-24\dfrac{(\phi'_1(y))^3}{\phi^{5}_1(y)}\bigg).
\end{aligned}
\] Hence, by the estimate in Lemma~\ref{Supremum estimate} together with the estimate on the third derivative of $\phi$ in \eqref{bound on the third derivative of phi1}, we conclude that $\partial_yf \in H^1_y$. Thus, we can deduce that 
\[|\mathfrak{E}_1^2|\leq C.
\]

To get a handle on the first term, $\mathfrak{E}_1^1$, we first rewrite it explicitly in complex form, namely
\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathfrak{E}_1^1&=-2i\int_{-1}^1\bigg( \dfrac{U^2_{m,\gamma}(y)+(c_i)^2-2iU_{m,\gamma}(y)c_i)}{(U^2_{m,\gamma}(y)+(c_i)^2)^2} \bigg)\dfrac{1}{U_{m,\gamma}'(0)}\partial_y(\frac{1}{\phi^2_1(y)})\Big(\frac{1}{\phi_2^2(y,ic_i)}-1\Big)\;dy\\&
=-4\int_{-1}^1\bigg( \dfrac{U_{m,\gamma}(y)c_i}{(U^2_{m,\gamma}(y)+(c_i)^2)^2} \bigg)\dfrac{1}{U_{m,\gamma}'(0)}\partial_y(\frac{1}{\phi^2_1(y)})\Big(\frac{1}{\phi_2^2(y,ic_i)}-1\Big)\;dy\\&
\qquad-2i\int_{-1}^1\bigg( \dfrac{1}{U^2_{m,\gamma}(y)+(c_i)^2} \bigg)\dfrac{1}{U_{m,\gamma}'(0)}\partial_y(\frac{1}{\phi^2_1(y)})\Big(\frac{1}{\phi_2^2(y,ic_i)}-1\Big)\;dy.
\end{aligned}
\] Clearly that 
\[
|\mathfrak{E}_1^1|^2\leq (\mathfrak{Re}\mathfrak{E}_1^1)^2+(\mathfrak{Im}\mathfrak{E}_1^1)^2
\]
various bounds for $\phi_1$, $\phi_2$ and their derivatives found in Lemma~\ref{phi1 phi2} in Appendix~\ref{Related Results} we obtain 
\[
\begin{aligned}
 &|\mathfrak{E}_1^1|\leq C\bigg|\dfrac{\phi'_1(y)(1-\phi_2)(y,ic_i)}{(U_{m,\gamma}(y)-ic_i)^2}\bigg|\bigg|\dfrac{1}{\phi^3_1}\bigg|\bigg|\dfrac{1+\phi_2(y,ic_i)}{\phi^2_2(y,ic_i)}\bigg|\leq C_1.
\end{aligned}
\]
Thus, we can conclude that $|\mathfrak{E}_1|\leq C$. Let us focus on $\mathfrak{E}_2$. Again, via the estimate on the good derivative $\partial_G \phi_2$ in Lemma~\ref{partial G phi2} and bounds on $\phi_1$, $\phi_2$ and their derivatives in Lemma~\ref{phi1 phi2}, the expression for $\mathfrak{E}_2$ is indeed bounded.
%As $c_i \to 0$, we have
%\[
%\mathcal{E}_1\to -4i \int_{-1}^{1}\dfrac{1}{(U_{m,\gamma})^2(y)}\dfrac{\widetilde{T}(1)}{\phi_1^2(y)}\;dy,
%\] where $\widetilde{T}(1)=\lim_{c_i\to 0} T(1)$ and we have used the fact that $\norm{\phi_2-1}_{L^\infty}\lesssim c_i$. 


Now, it remains to show that $\text{II}'_1$ is bounded as well. Recall again that 
\[
\begin{aligned}
    \text{II}'_1&=\int_{-1}^1\bigg( \dfrac{1}{\phi_1^2(y)\phi_2^2(y,ic_i)}-1\bigg)\Bigg[\partial_G \bigg( \dfrac{1}{(U_{m,\gamma}-ic_i)^2(y)} \bigg)\Bigg]\;dy\\
                &=-2i\int_{-1}^1\bigg( \dfrac{1}{\phi_1^2(y)\phi_2^2(y,ic_i)}-1\bigg)\Bigg[\bigg( \frac{U'_m(y)}{U'_m(0)}-1\bigg)\bigg( \dfrac{1}{(U_{m,\gamma}-ic_i)^3(y)} \bigg)\Bigg]\;dy.
\end{aligned}
\] The integral above is clearly well-defined. Again, using the bounds in Lemma~\ref{phi1 phi2}, we know that the integrand is bounded. Hence, it is straightforward to conclude that $\text{II}'_1$ is bounded.
\end{comment}
Altogether, we have shown that 
\[
|\partial_{c_i}\text{II}|\leq C.
\]
Combining all terms back together gives us,
\[
|\partial_{c_i}\text{I}_1|-\Big(|\text{II}'_1|+|\text{II}'_2|\Big)\leq |\partial_{c_i}W(m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)|\leq|\partial_{c_i}\text{I}_1|+|\partial_{c_i}\text{I}_2|+|\text{II}'_1|+|\text{II}'_2|.
\]
Thus, taking $\gamma$ sufficiently small results in the following inequality
\begin{equation}\label{estimate of partial ci W}
    C^{-1}\dfrac{1}{\gamma}\leq |\partial_{c_i}W(m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)|\leq C\dfrac{1}{\gamma}.
\end{equation}
with constant $C$ independent of $\gamma$ and $c_i$.
\begin{comment}
    Hence, as $c_i\to 0$, 
\[
\text{II}'_1 \to -2i\int_{-1}^1\bigg( \dfrac{1}{\phi_1^2(y)}-1\bigg)\Bigg[\bigg( \frac{U'_m(y)}{U'_m(0)}-1\bigg)\bigg( \dfrac{1}{(U_{m,\gamma})^3(y)} \bigg)\Bigg]\;dy.
\]

Altogether, we can conclude that the real part of $\partial_{c_i}\text{I}+\partial_{c_i}\text{II}$ is nothing but
\begin{equation}\label{Real part of partial ci W}
\Re{(\partial_{c_i}\text{I}+\partial_{c_i}\text{II})}=\bigg(\dfrac{-U'''_m(y)}{(U'_m)^4(y)}\bigg)\bigg|_{y=0}-4\pi\dfrac{\phi_1''(0)}{(U'_m(0))^2}.
\end{equation}
\end{comment}

\begin{comment}
    One can see that the above expression can be made to be nonzero when $\gamma$ is chosen sufficiently large. This tells us that $\partial_{c_i}W|_{(0,m_*)} \neq 0$. Hence, by the Implicit function theorem, for any $m$ in a sufficiently small neighborhood of $m_*$, one can find $c=ic_i$, such that $W(c,m)=0$. Direct computations on \eqref{Real part of partial ci W} yield the following lower bound estimate 
\end{comment}
Since, this estimate is uniform in $m$ and $c$, setting $m=m_*$ and $c=0$ yields 
\begin{equation}
    C^{-1}\dfrac{1}{\gamma}\leq |\partial_{c_i}W(m_*,\gamma,0,-1)|\leq C\dfrac{1}{\gamma}.
\end{equation} By implicit function theorem, we know that there exists $\delta_{0}>0$ such that for any $\gamma\in(0,\gamma_0)$ and $m_*<m\leq m_*+\delta_0$, we have $W(m,\gamma,ic_i,\lambda)=0$. In light of Remark~\ref{TFAE statement}, $\kappa=ikc=i(\pm1)ic_i=\pm c_i$ are at least the two eigenvalues of $\mathcal{L}_{U_{m,\gamma}}$ for $m\in(m_*,m_*+\delta_0]$ . This completes the proof of Theorem~\ref{linear}\ref{Instability}.
\end{proof}


\begin{proof}[\textbf{Proof of Theorem~\ref{linear}~\eqref{estimate for lambda r}}]
It remains, therefore, to obtain the estimate displayed in \eqref{estimate for lambda r}. Intuitively, such estimate provides us with information about the location of an unstable mode. Deducing it requires us to go through a series of tedious estimates. We begin by showing that $\partial_m W(m,\gamma,ic_i,-1) \approx C $.
Recall that for any $(m,c)=(m,ic_i)$, the Wronskian is given by the expression in \eqref{modified wronskian at cr 0}.

\partial_m\text{II}&=\int_{-1}^1\partial_m\bigg(\dfrac{1}{(U_{m,\gamma}-ic_i)^2}\bigg) \Bigg( \dfrac{1}{(\phi_1^E(y,m,c_r,-1))^2}-1\Bigg)\;dy\\&
\qquad +\int_{-1}^1 \bigg(\dfrac{1}{(U_{m,\gamma}-ic_i)^2}\bigg) \partial_m\Bigg( \dfrac{1}{(\phi_1^E(y,m,c_r,-1))^2}-1\Bigg)\;dy\\&
=\int_{-1}^1 \bigg(\dfrac{-2(\gamma^2 \widetilde{\Gamma}(y/\gamma))}{(U_{m,\gamma}-ic_i)^3}\bigg) \Bigg( \dfrac{1}{(\phi_1^E(y,m,c_r,-1))^2}-1\Bigg)\;dy\\&
\qquad +\int_{-1}^1 \bigg(\dfrac{1}{(U_{m,\gamma}-ic_i)^2}\bigg) \Bigg( \dfrac{- 2\partial_m(\phi_1^E(y,m,c_r,-1))}{(\phi_1^E(y,m,c_r,-1))^3}\Bigg)\;dy=:\text{II}^{(1)}+\text{II}^{(2)}.
\end{aligned}
\]
Looking closely at the integrand of $\text{II}^{(1)}$, we can say that the first part of the integrand can be bounded as follows
\[
\bigg|\dfrac{-2(\gamma^2 \widetilde{\Gamma}(y/\gamma))}{(U_{m,\gamma}-ic_i)^3}\bigg|\leq \dfrac{C\gamma^2}{y^2+(c_i)^2}.
\]
Moreover, the second part of the integrand involving $\phi_1^E$ is bounded by using the estimates in Lemma~\ref{phi1 phi2}. It has two zeros that can cancel the singularity caused by the term $y^2+(c_i)^2$ from the above estimate. 

To get an estimate of the term $\text{II}^{(2)}$, we first use Lemma~\ref{partial m phi1} together with Lemma~\ref{phi1 phi2} to bound the portion of the integrand involving $\phi_1^E$. More precisely, one obtains the estimate

\[
 \bigg|\dfrac{- 2\partial_m(\phi_1^E(y,m,c_r,-1))}{(\phi_1^E(y,m,c_r,-1))^3}\bigg|\leq Cy^2,
\]
where C is independent of $\gamma$.

On the other hand, the other term in the integrand of  $\text{II}^{(2)}$ obeys the following estimate, namely
\[
\bigg|\dfrac{1}{(U_{m,\gamma}-ic_i)^2}\bigg|\leq \dfrac{1}{y^2+(c_i)^2}.
\]
Combining the two bounds gives us
\[
|\text{II}^{(2)}|\leq \int_{-1}^1 \dfrac{y^2}{y^2+(c_i)^2} \;dy\leq C.
\]

%estimate on partial_m W(ic_i,\lambda)
In order to get an estimate of $\partial_m W(m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)$, we recast the Wronskian in the following way:

\begin{equation}\label{partial m W}
  \begin{aligned}
 W(m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)&= \bigg(\dfrac{-1}{U'_{m,\gamma}(0)} \int_{-1}^{1} \dfrac{U'_{m,\gamma}(y)-U_{m,\gamma}'(0)}{(U_{m,\gamma}(y)-ic_i)^2}\;dy\bigg)-\dfrac{1}{U'_{m,\gamma}(0)}\bigg[\dfrac{1}{(U_{m,\gamma}(1)-ic_i}-\dfrac{1}{U_{m,\gamma}(-1)-ic_i}\bigg]\\&
 \qquad+ \bigg(\int_{-1}^1 \dfrac{1}{(U_{m,\gamma}(y)-ic_i)^2}\bigg(\dfrac{1}{(\phi_1^E)^2(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)}-1\bigg)\;dy\bigg).
\end{aligned}  
\end{equation}
Taking a partial derivative with respect to $m$ yields
\[
\partial_m W(m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)= \Pi^1+\Pi^2+\Pi^3+\Pi^4,
\]
where
\[
\begin{aligned}
\Pi^1&:=\partial_m\bigg(\dfrac{-1}{U'_{m,\gamma}(0)} \int_{-1}^{1} \dfrac{U'_{m,\gamma}(y)-U_{m,\gamma}'(0)}{(U_{m,\gamma}(y)-ic_i)^2}\;dy\bigg),\\
\Pi^2&:=\partial_m\bigg(\dfrac{1}{U'_{m,\gamma}(0)}\bigg)\bigg[\dfrac{1}{(U_{m,\gamma}(1)-ic_i}-\dfrac{1}{U_{m,\gamma}(-1)-ic_i}\bigg],\\
\Pi^3&:=\dfrac{1}{U'_{m,\gamma}(0)}\partial_m\bigg[\dfrac{1}{(U_{m,\gamma}(1)-ic_i}-\dfrac{1}{U_{m,\gamma}(-1)-ic_i}\bigg],\\
\Pi^4&:=\partial_m \bigg(\int_{-1}^1 \dfrac{1}{(U_{m,\gamma}(y)-ic_i)^2}\bigg(\dfrac{1}{(\phi_1^E)^2(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)}-1\bigg)\;dy\bigg).
\end{aligned}
\]

Let us now discuss each term individually. First of all, via integration by parts, $\Pi^1$ can be written in the following way
\[
\begin{aligned}
    \partial_m\Bigg(\dfrac{-1}{U'_{m,\gamma}(0)} \int_{-1}^{1} \dfrac{U'_{m,\gamma}(y)-U_{m,\gamma}'(0)}{(U_{m,\gamma}(y)-ic_i)^2}\;dy\Bigg)&=\partial_m\Bigg(\dfrac{1}{U'_{m,\gamma}(0)}\bigg[\dfrac{(U_{m,\gamma}(y)+ic_i)}{U^2_{m,\gamma}(y)+(c_i)^2}\bigg(\dfrac{U'_{m,\gamma}(y)-U'_{m,\gamma}(0)}{U'_{m,\gamma}(y)}\bigg)\bigg|_{-1}^{1}\bigg]\\&
    \qquad-\dfrac{1}{U'_{m,\gamma}(0)}\int_{-1}^{1} \dfrac{U'_{m,\gamma}(0)U''_{m,\gamma}(y)(U_{m,\gamma}(y)+ic_i)}{U^2_{m,\gamma}(y)+(c_i)^2}\;dy\Bigg).
\end{aligned}
\]
As a consequence, we can subdivide $\Pi^1$ into three different parts, namely 
\[
\begin{aligned}
\Pi^1=\Pi^1_1+\Pi^1_2+\Pi^1_3,
%\partial_m\bigg(\dfrac{1}{U'_{m,\gamma}(0)}\bigg)\bigg[\dfrac{(U_{m,\gamma}(y)+ic_i)}{U^2_{m,\gamma}(y)+(c_i)^2}\bigg(\dfrac{U'_{m,\gamma}(y)-U'_{m,\gamma}(0)}{U'_{m,\gamma}(y)}\bigg)\bigg|_{-1}^{1}\bigg]\\&
%\qquad+ \bigg(\dfrac{1}{U'_{m,\gamma}(0)}\bigg)\partial_m \bigg[\dfrac{(U_{m,\gamma}(y)+ic_i)}{U^2_{m,\gamma}(y)+(c_i)^2}\bigg(\dfrac{U'_{m,\gamma}(y)-U'_{m,\gamma}(0)}{U'_{m,\gamma}(y)}\bigg)\bigg|_{-1}^{1}\bigg]\\&
%\qquad-\partial_m\bigg(\dfrac{1}{U'_{m,\gamma}(0)}\bigg)\int_{-1}^{1} \dfrac{U'_{m,\gamma}(0)U''_{m,\gamma}(y)(U_{m,\gamma}(y)+ic_i)}{U^2_{m,\gamma}(y)+(c_i)^2}\;dy\\&
%\qquad -\bigg(\dfrac{1}{U'_{m,\gamma}(0)}\bigg)\partial_m\int_{-1}^{1} \dfrac{U'_{m,\gamma}(0)U''_{m,\gamma}(y)(U_{m,\gamma}(y)+ic_i)}{U^2_{m,\gamma}(y)+(%c_i)^2}\;dy\\&
\end{aligned}
\]
where

\begin{align*}
&\Pi^1_1:=\dfrac{\gamma \Gamma(0)}{(U'_{m,\gamma}(0))^2}\bigg[\dfrac{(U_{m,\gamma}(y)+ic_i)}{U^2_{m,\gamma}(y)+(c_i)^2}\bigg(\dfrac{U'_{m,\gamma}(y)-U'_{m,\gamma}(0)}{U'_{m,\gamma}(y)}\bigg)\bigg|_{-1}^{1}\bigg]\\&
\qquad +\bigg(\dfrac{\gamma}{U'_{m,\gamma}(0)}\bigg)\bigg[\dfrac{\gamma\widetilde{\Gamma}(y/\gamma)(U'_{m,\gamma}(y)-U'_{m,\gamma}(0))+(U_{m,\gamma}(y)+ic_i)(\Gamma(y/\gamma)-\Gamma(0))}{(U^2_{m,\gamma}(y)+(c_i)^2)(U'_{m,\gamma}(y))}\\&
\qquad \qquad +\dfrac{\Big(2\gamma \widetilde{\Gamma}(y/\gamma)U'_{m,\gamma}(y)+\Gamma(y/\gamma)(U^2_{m,\gamma}(y)+(c_i)^2)\Big)\Big(U_{m,\gamma}(y)+ic_i\Big)\Big(U'_{m,\gamma}(y)-U_{m,\gamma}(0)\Big)}{(U^2_{m,\gamma}(y)+(c_i)^2)^2(U'_{m,\gamma}(y))^2}\bigg|_{-1}^{1}\bigg],\\&
\Pi^1_2:= -\dfrac{\gamma}{U'_{m,\gamma}(0)}\int_{-1}^{1}\bigg[\dfrac{2\Gamma(0)U''_{m,\gamma}(y)(U_{m,\gamma}(y)+ic_i)+U'_{m,\gamma}(0)U''_{m,\gamma}(y)\gamma\widetilde{\Gamma}(y/\gamma)}{U^2_{m,\gamma}(y)+(c_i)^2}\\&
\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad  \qquad \qquad +\dfrac{2\gamma \widetilde{\Gamma}(y/\gamma)U_{m,\gamma}(y)U'_{m,\gamma}(0)U''_{m,\gamma}(y)(U_{m,\gamma}(y)+ic_i)}{(U^2_{m,\gamma}(y)+(c_i)^2)^2}\bigg]\;dy,\\&
\Pi^1_3:=-\dfrac{1}{U'_{m,\gamma}(0)}\int_{-1}^{1}\dfrac{U'_{m,\gamma}(0)\Gamma'(y/\gamma)(U_{m,\gamma}(y)+ic_i)}{U^2_{m,\gamma}(y)+(c_i)^2}\;dy.
\end{align*}

It is not hard to see that the boundary terms in the expression of $\Pi^1_1$ give rise to the following estimate
\[
|\Pi^1_1|\leq C \gamma.
\]
Let us now jump into $\Pi^1_3$. Spilliting the expression into real and imaginary parts yields
\[
\Pi^1_3=-\int_{-1}^{1}\dfrac{\Gamma'(y/\gamma)U_{m,\gamma}(y)}{U^2_{m,\gamma}(y)+(c_i)^2}\;dy-ic_i\int_{-1}^{1}\dfrac{\Gamma'(y/\gamma)}{U^2_{m,\gamma}(y)+(c_i)^2}\;dy=:\mathfrak{Re}(\Pi^1_3)+\mathfrak{Im}(\Pi^1_3)
\]
For the real part, observe that 
\[
\mathfrak{Re}(\Pi^1_3)=-\int_{|y|<\gamma}\dfrac{\Gamma'(y/\gamma)U_{m,\gamma}(y)}{U^2_{m,\gamma}(y)+(c_i)^2}\;dy-\int_{1\geq|y|\geq \gamma}\dfrac{\Gamma'(y/\gamma)U_{m,\gamma}(y)}{U^2_{m,\gamma}(y)+(c_i)^2}\;dy.
\]
The integral first integral in $\mathfrak{Re}(\Pi^1_3)$ reads
\[
\begin{aligned}
   -\int_{|y|<\gamma}\dfrac{\Gamma'(y/\gamma)U_{m,\gamma}(y)}{U^2_{m,\gamma}(y)+(c_i)^2}\;dy&\approx -\int_{\substack{|y|<c_i}}\dfrac{\dfrac{\Gamma'(y/\gamma)}{(y/\gamma)}(y^2/\gamma)}{y^2+(c_i)^2}\;dy-\int_{\substack{c_i\leq |y|\leq\gamma}}\dfrac{\dfrac{\Gamma'(y/\gamma)}{(y/\gamma)}(y^2/\gamma)}{y^2+(c_i)^2}\;dy\\&
   \approx \int_{\substack{|y|< c_i}}C \dfrac{y^2}{(c_i)^2}\dfrac{1}{\gamma}\;dy-\frac{1}{\gamma}\int_{\substack{c_i\leq|y|\leq\gamma}}\dfrac{\Gamma'(y/\gamma)}{(y/\gamma)}\;dy\\
   &\approx \frac{\gamma-|c_i|}{\gamma}\approx 1 \quad \text{for}\quad |c_i|\leq \epsilon_0\gamma.
\end{aligned}
\]
For the second integral in $\mathfrak{Re}(\Pi^1_3)$, we have
\begin{align*}
    0< -\int_{1\geq|y|\geq \gamma}\dfrac{\Gamma'(y/\gamma)U_{m,\gamma}(y)}{U^2_{m,\gamma}(y)+(c_i)^2}\;dy
    \lesssim -\int_{1\geq|y|\geq \gamma}\dfrac{\Gamma'(y/\gamma)}{y/\gamma}\frac{1}{\gamma}dy\leq 1
\end{align*}
Next, we estimate the imaginary part of $\Pi^1_3$. Direct computation tells us that
\[
|\mathfrak{Im}(\Pi^1_3)|=\int_{-1}^{1}\dfrac{|c_i|}{U^2_{m,\gamma}(y)+(c_i)^2}\;dy\leq C.
\] Hence, we can infer that there exists $C>0$ such that
\[
C^{-1}<|\Pi^1_3|<C.
\]

To finish the bound for $\Pi^1$, it remains to derive an estimate for $\Pi^1_2$. It is important to realize that $\Pi^1_2$ shares a similar structure as $\Pi^1_3$. Hence, to obtain an estimate for $\Pi^1_2$, one can go through the same process as estimating $\Pi^1_3$. Therefore, one can say
\[
|\Pi^1_2|\leq C \gamma.
\]

In order to get an estimate on the boundary term $\Pi^2$,we first rewrite $\Pi^2$ as 
\[
\Pi^2=\dfrac{-\gamma\Gamma(0)}{(U'_{m,\gamma}(0))^2}\bigg[\dfrac{U_{m,\gamma}(y)+ic_i}{U^2_{m,\gamma}+(c_i)^2}\bigg]\bigg|_{-1}^{1}.
\]
It is not hard to see that we obtain the following bound
\[
|\Pi^2|\leq C\gamma.
\]
The next term we shall discuss is $\Pi^3$. Notice that
\[
\begin{aligned}
\Pi^3&=\dfrac{\gamma^2}{U'_{m,\gamma}(0)}\bigg[\dfrac{-\widetilde{\Gamma}(y/\gamma)}{U^2_{m,\gamma}+(c_i)^2}-\dfrac{2\widetilde{\Gamma}(y/\gamma)U_{m,\gamma}(y)(U_{m,\gamma}(y)+ic_i)}{(U^2_{m,\gamma}+(c_i)^2)^2}\bigg]\bigg|_{-1}^{1}.
\end{aligned}
\]
Therefore, we can say that 
\[
|\Pi^3|\leq C\gamma^2.
\]
Last but not least, let us estimate the term $\Pi^4$. We start by rewriting $\Pi^4$ explicitly as follows
\[
\begin{aligned}
\Pi^4&=\int_{-1}^1\dfrac{-2\gamma^2\widetilde{\Gamma}(y/\gamma)}{(U_{m,\gamma}(y)-ic_i)^3}\bigg(\dfrac{1}{(\phi_1^E)^2(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)}-1\bigg)\\&
\quad +\dfrac{1}{(U_{m,\gamma}(y)-ic_i)^2}\partial_m\bigg(\dfrac{1}{(\phi_1^E)^2(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)}-1\bigg)\;dy\\&=\Pi^4_1+\Pi^4_2.
\end{aligned}
\]
The integral in $\Pi^4_1$ is well-defined. Moreover,
\[
|\Pi^4_1|\leq \int_{-1}^1\dfrac{\gamma}{(y^2+(c_i)^2)}\lVert\Gamma(y/\gamma)\rVert_{L^{\infty}}\bigg(\dfrac{1}{(\phi_1^E)^2(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)}-1\bigg)\;dy\leq C \gamma^2,
\]
where we have used the bounds in Lemma~\ref{phi1 phi2} and the fact that the last term in the integrand involving $\phi_1^E$ has two zeros.
And to get the other bound we are going to use the estimate in Lemma~\ref{partial m phi1} 
\[
|\Pi^4_2|\leq C\gamma.
\]
By choosing the constant $C$ sufficiently large, we conclude
\[
|\Pi^4|\leq C \gamma.
\]

Finally, gathering all terms back, we get
\[
|\Pi^1_3|-\Big(|\Pi^1_1|+|\Pi^1_2|+|\Pi^2|+|\Pi^3|+|\Pi^4|\bigg)\leq|\partial_m W(m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)|\leq |\Pi^1_3|+\Big(|\Pi^1_1|+|\Pi^1_2|+|\Pi^2|+|\Pi^3|+|\Pi^4|\Big).
\]
Hence, by choosing $\gamma$ sufficiently small, one can infer that 
\[
|\partial_m W(m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)| \approx C.
\]
Combining this estimate with the lower bound in \eqref{estimate of partial ci W}  yields
\[
|\partial_m(c_i)|\approx \gamma.
\] Hence, the proof of Theorem~\ref{linear} is complete. \qedhere
\end{proof}

Having completed the proof for Theorem~\ref{linear}. We are now ready to present our argument for Theorem~\ref{nonlinear}. This is exactly the content of what is coming next.
%Additionally, we would like to mention that concerning the regularity, we have proved a related lemma. Due to its technicality, we have placed it in the Appendix~\ref{Regularity}. 

\subsection{Nontrivial steady solution}\label{Cat's eyes}
In this subsection, we show an existence of a flow that solves \eqref{original euler} with non-shearing structure. As mentioned at the outset, this portion of our work is fully inspired by the seminal work of \cite{LinZeng2011}. In the aforementioned paper, both authors, Lin and Zeng, showed an existence of a steady nontrivial (non-sheared) flow near Couette. In contrast, our result applies to a general class of monotonic background shear flows (not only Couette). To that end, we begin with the following lemma.
\begin{lemma}\label{Bifurcation}
Let $\mathcal{U}$ and $G$ be as stated in Lemma~\ref{regularity lemma}. If the operator
\begin{equation}\label{Operator L}
\mathcal{X}:=-\dfrac{d^2}{dy^2}+\dfrac{\mathcal{U}''}{\mathcal{U}},\; H^{2}(-1,1) \to L^{2}(-1,1),
\end{equation} with Dirichlet boundary conditions at $y\in \{\pm1\}$ has a negative eigenvalue $-k_0^2$, then there exists  $\epsilon_0>0$ such that for any $0 < \epsilon<\epsilon_0$, there exist a nontrivial (non-sheared) steady solution $(u_\epsilon(x,y),v_\epsilon(x,y))$ with period $T_\epsilon$ such that 
\begin{equation}\label{norm nonsheard and background shear}
 \norm{(u_{\epsilon}(x,y),v_{\epsilon}(x,y))-(\mathcal{U},0)}_{H^{2}(\mathbb{T}_{2\pi}\times[-1,1])}=\epsilon.
\end{equation} As $\epsilon \to 0$, the period $T_\epsilon \to \frac{2 \pi}{k_0}$. Moreover, 
\begin{equation}\label{higher exponent norm}
 \norm{(u_{\epsilon}(x,y),v_{\epsilon}(x,y))-(\mathcal{U},0)}_{H^{5/2-\tau+N}(\mathbb{T}_{2\pi}\times[-1,1])}\leq C(\gamma,N) \epsilon.
\end{equation}
Here the constant $C(\gamma,N)$ depends on $\gamma, N$. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof} 
We recall the definition of $\widetilde{\psi}_0$ in \eqref{definition of tilde psi}. 
For arbitrary stream function, we introduce the extension of the map $G\in C^1(\min{\widetilde{\psi}_0},\max{\widetilde{\psi}_0})$ via $\widetilde{G}\in C^1_0(\mathbb{R})$ to the entire real line where $\widetilde{G} \equiv G$ on $[\min{\widetilde{\psi}_0},\max{\widetilde{\psi}_0}]$. One can check that any stream function $\psi $ that solves
\begin{equation}\label{Poisson-type eq}
\Delta \psi= \widetilde{G}(\psi),
\end{equation}
is indeed also a solution of \eqref{Euler Equations}. In preparation of implementing a bifurcation framework, we introduce a new horizontal variable $\zeta:=kx$. The variable $k$ will play a role as the bifurcation parameter in our construction. In the new coordinate $(\zeta,y)$, the stream function $\psi$ becomes $\bar{\psi}$. Therefore, equation \eqref{Poisson-type eq} now reads 

\begin{equation}\label{Poisson-type eq in new variable}
k^2\dfrac{\partial^2}{\partial_\zeta^2}\bar{\psi}(\zeta,y) +\dfrac{\partial^2}{\partial_y^2}\bar{\psi}(\zeta,y) = \widetilde{G}(\bar{\psi}(\zeta,y)).
\end{equation} 

Our goal is to construct ``near-by solutions"  to the background flow. In light of that, we consider the perturbation of the background stream function 
\[
\psi_{\text{per}}(\zeta, y)=\bar{\psi}(\zeta,y)-\psi_0(y),
\] where the subscript ``per" refers to perturbation. 

We define the following two spaces
\[
P:=\{\psi_{\text{per}}(\zeta,y)\in H^3(\mathbb{T}_{2 \pi}\times [-1,-1]), \psi_{\text{per}}(\zeta,-1)=0=\psi_{\text{per}}(\zeta,1),2\pi-\text{periodic}\},
\]
and
\[
D:=\{\psi_{\text{per}}(\zeta,y)\in H^1(\mathbb{T}_{2 \pi}\times [-1,-1]), \psi_{\text{per}}(\zeta,-1)=0=\psi_{\text{per}}(\zeta,1),2\pi-\text{periodic}\}.
\]
Via \eqref{Poisson-type eq in new variable}, we define an operator
\[
\mathcal{F}(\psi_{\text{per}},k^2):P\times \mathbb{R}^+ \to D,
\]
by
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{F}(\psi_{\text{per}},k^2):&=k^2\dfrac{\partial^2}{\partial_\zeta^2}\psi_{\text{per}}+\dfrac{\partial^2}{\partial_y^2}\psi_{\text{per}} -\Big(\widetilde{G}(\psi_{\text{per}}+\psi_0)-\widetilde{G}(\psi_0)\Big),
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Observe that for any $k\in \mathbb{R}$, $\mathcal{F}(0,k^2)=0$. We then linearize the operator $\mathcal{F}$ around $(\psi_{\text{per}},k^2)=(0,k_0^2)$, where $k_0$ is the wave number that corresponds to the negative eigenvalue of the Sturm--Liouville problem. The resulting linearized operator around $(0,k_0^2)$ now reads
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\mathfrak{L}:=\mathcal{F}_{\psi_{\text{per}}}(0,k_0^2)&=k_0^2 \dfrac{\partial^2}{\partial_\zeta^2}+\dfrac{\partial^2}{\partial_y^2}-\widetilde{G}'(\psi_0)\\
                    &=k_0^2 \dfrac{\partial^2}{\partial_\zeta^2}+\dfrac{\partial^2}{\partial_y^2}-\dfrac{\mathcal{U}''}{\mathcal{U}}.\end{aligned}
\end{equation}  Let $\phi_0$ be the associated positive eigenvector of the eigenvalue $-k_0^2$ of $\mathcal{X}$. One can check that the kernel of $\mathfrak{L}$ given by
\[
\textup{Ker}(\mathfrak{L})=\textup{span}(\phi_0(y) \cos{\zeta}),
\] is one dimensional. Further, since $\mathfrak{L}$ is self-adjoint, then $\phi_0(y) \cos{\zeta} \notin \text{Ran}(\mathfrak{L})$. One can also see that 
\begin{equation}\label{mixed derivative}
\lim_{k \to k_0}\dfrac{\partial_{\psi_{\text{per}}}\mathcal{F}(0,k^2)(\phi_0(y) \cos{\zeta})-\partial_{\psi_{\text{per}}}\mathcal{F}(0,k_0^2)(\phi_0(y) \cos{\zeta})}{k^2-k_0^2}=-\phi_0(y) \cos{\zeta} \notin \text{Ran}(\mathfrak{L}).
\end{equation}Formally speaking, the mixed-higher derivative is well-defined at $(0,k_0^2)$ in the direction of the kernel.

All of these facts together allow us to employ the Crandall--Rabinowitz local bifurcation theorem \cite{CrandallRabinowitz1971} from which we obtain a one-parameter local curve of solutions
\[
\mathcal{C}^\epsilon_{\loc}:=\{\psi_{\text{per}}(\epsilon),k^2(
\epsilon): \mathcal{F}(\psi_{\text{per}}(\epsilon),k^2(\epsilon))=0,\; 0\leq \epsilon<\epsilon_0\} \subset H^3 \times \mathbb{R},
\]
for some $\epsilon_0>0.$
 It is important to remark that the curve $\mathcal{C}^\epsilon_{\loc}$ contains the information of the perturbation. As $\epsilon \to 0$, then $(\psi_{\text{per}}(\epsilon),k^2(\epsilon))\to (0,k^2_0)$; this is the case when perturbation size shrinks to zero. Hence, to the leading order, the perturbed stream function takes the form
 \begin{equation}
 \bar{\psi}(\zeta,y)=\psi_0(y)+\epsilon \phi_0(y) \cos{\zeta}+o(\epsilon),
 \end{equation}
 where $\phi_0$ is the positive eigenfunction associated with eigenvalue $-k_0^2$ of the operator $\mathcal{X}$. This gives rise to the non-sheared solution and the norm in \eqref{norm nonsheard and background shear}.
 
 In order to obtain the estimate on the higher regularity \eqref{higher exponent norm}, we first recall from Lemma~\ref{regularity lemma} that the map $\widetilde{G}\in C^{N+1}$. Using the equation
 \[
 \Delta \psi_{\text{per}}(\zeta,y)=\widetilde{G}(\psi_{\text{per}}(\zeta,y))=\psi_{\text{per}}(\zeta,y)\int_{0}^1\widetilde{G}'(\psi_0+s(\psi_{\text{per}}(\zeta,y)))\;ds.
 \]
 and \eqref{norm nonsheard and background shear},
along with some elliptic bootstrap argument, we get the desired estimate \eqref{higher exponent norm}.
 \qedhere
 \end{proof}
 
 \begin{remark}
We would like to mention that here we do not require $\mathcal{F}$ to belong to $C^2$. Rather, we are content with $\mathcal{F}\in C^1$ as we only need the mix derivative \eqref{mixed derivative} to exist at the point $(0,k_0^2)$ which is one of the sufficient requirements to use the bifurcation theory of \cite{CrandallRabinowitz1971}. This level of regularity condition on $\mathcal{F}$ is indeed weaker than the one used in \cite{LinZeng2011}.
\end{remark}

The remaining portion of this section will be devoted to proving Theorem~\ref{nonlinear}. Most of the ingredients for the proof has been established in Lemma~\ref{Bifurcation}. Additionally, our shear flow $(\mathcal{U},0)$ now takes the form $(U_{m,\gamma},0))$, that is the perturbed shear flow of $(U,0)$. The local bifurcation curve will start at the perturbed background shear. Note that the assumptions on $\mathcal{U}$ are also satisfied by $U_{m,\gamma}$.  Furthermore, the spectral condition required in Lemma~\ref{Bifurcation} for $\mathcal{X}$ is also satisfied by the operator  $\mathcal{H}_{m,\gamma}$.

Moreover, due to the monotonicity of $\lambda_{m,\gamma}$, we can choose $m$ on the interval $|m-m_*|\lesssim \gamma^N$ such that the corresponding operator $\mathcal{H}_{m,\gamma_*}$ has a minimal eigenvalue $\lambda_{m,\gamma_*}$ located close to $-1$ with the associated eigenfunction satisfying the Dirichlet conditions at $y=\pm 1$. 
 
 From Lemma~\ref{Bifurcation}, it is known that for any $m\in (m_*-\gamma^N,m_*+\gamma^N)$, we have a local curve of solutions of the 2-D Euler equations parameterized by $\epsilon$ with $0<\epsilon<\epsilon_0$ \eqref{Euler Equations}  bifurcating from the shear flow $(U_{m,\gamma}(y),0)$ where a nontrivial (non-sheared) steady flow belongs. 

%Moreover, we claim that for any $m\in (m_*-\gamma^N,m_*+\gamma^N)$ and $r\in[0,5/2+N)$, 
%\[
%\norm{}
%\]
 Via the monotonicity of eigenvalue $\lambda_{m,\gamma}$, there exist $m_1\in(m_*-\gamma^N,m_*)$,  $m_2\in(m_*,m_*+\gamma^N)$, such that 
\[
\lambda_{m_1,\gamma_*;\epsilon}<-1<\lambda_{m_2,\gamma_*;\epsilon}.
\]
Moreover, for any $m\in(m_1,m_2)$, we can show that when $0 \leq s< 5/2+N$,
\[
\norm{U_{m,\gamma}(y)-U(y)}_{H^s(-1,1)}\to 0 \text{ as } \gamma\to 0.
\]
First of all, it is not hard to see that 
\[
U_{m,\gamma}(y)-U_{m_*,\gamma}(y)=(m-m*)\gamma^2\widetilde\Gamma(y/\gamma).
\]
Hence, 
\[
\norm{U_{m,\gamma}(y)-U_{m_*,\gamma}(y)}_{H^s(-1,1)}\lesssim \norm{\gamma^{2+N}\widetilde\Gamma(y/\gamma)}_{H^s(\mathbb{R})}.
\]
But, 
\[
\norm{\gamma^{2+N}\widetilde\Gamma(y/\gamma)}_{L^2(\mathbb{R})} \lesssim \gamma^{3+N}, \text{ and } \norm{\gamma^{2+N}\widetilde\Gamma(y/\gamma)}_{\dot{H}^s(\mathbb{R})} \lesssim \gamma^{5/2-s+N}.
\]
Therefore, we conclude that 
\begin{equation}\label{distance between background shears}
    \norm{U_{m,\gamma}(y)-U_{m_*,\gamma}(y)}_{H^{(\frac{5}{2}-s+N)}(-1,1)}\to 0 \text{ as } \gamma\to 0,
\end{equation}
for $0 \leq s< 5/2+N$.

Observe that, since $\lambda_{m,\gamma;\epsilon}$ is continuous with respect to $m$, the above inequality tells us that there exists a pair $(m^{\circ},\epsilon^{\circ})\in (m_1,m_2)\times(0,\epsilon_0)$ such that following along the local curve bifurcating from $U_{m^{\circ},\gamma_*}$, we find a nontrivial steady solution at the parameter value $\epsilon=\epsilon^{\circ}$ with  $k=\pm 1$ and satisfies the norm in \eqref{norm nonsheard and background shear}.
By choosing even smaller $m\in (m_*-m^{\circ},m_*+m^{\circ})$ and using the estimate \eqref{higher exponent norm}, one obtains
\[\norm{(u_{\epsilon}(x,y),v_{\epsilon}(x,y))-(U_{m,\gamma}(y),0)}_{H^{5/2-\tau+N}(\mathbb{T}_{2\pi}\times[-1,1])}\leq \epsilon,
\]
for sufficiently small $\epsilon>0$. This is precisely the desired inequality in \eqref{norm of the distance background and nontrivial}. Hence, this completes the proof of Theorem~\ref{nonlinear}. \qedhere

\section{Regular solution to the homogeneous Rayleigh equations}\label{Related Results}
The following appendix contains key lemmata that are used in some parts of the proofs throughout the paper. The first lemma below provides us with a representation of solution of the Rayleigh equation \eqref{Rayleigh Equation} along with some estimates of functions involved in he representation. Since this lemma has appeared in previous works, we have decided not to present its proof here. Following that is a sequence of lemma containing some derivative estimates. These estimates are used mostly in proving the results in Theorem~\ref{linear} to obtain bounds on various derivatives of the Wronskian.

\begin{lemma}\label{phi1 phi2}
For any $\lambda$, there exists $0<\epsilon_0\leq 1$, such that for any $c \in \mathfrak{B} \cap \mathfrak{D}_{\epsilon_0}\subset \mathbb{C}$, the Rayleigh equation \eqref{Rayleigh Equation} has a regular solution,
\[
\phi(y,m,\gamma,c,\lambda)=(U_{m,\gamma}(y)-c)\phi_1(y,m,\gamma,c_r,\lambda)\phi_2(y,m,\gamma,c,\lambda),
\]
which satisfies the conditions: $\phi(y_c,m,\gamma,c,\lambda)=0, \phi'(y_c,m,\gamma,c,\lambda)=U'_{m,\gamma}(y_c),$
where $U_{m,\gamma}(y_c)=c_r$. The function $\phi_1$ is a real-valued function that solves
\begin{equation}
    \left\{ \begin{aligned}
    &\partial_y\Big((U_{m,\gamma}(y)-c_r)^2\phi'_1(y,m,\gamma,c_r,\lambda)\Big)+\lambda\phi_1(y,m,\gamma,c_r,\lambda)(U_{m,\gamma}(y)-c_r)^2=0,\\
    & \phi_1(y_c,m,\gamma,c_r,\lambda)=1\qquad \phi'_1(y_c,m,\gamma,c_r,\lambda)=0. 
\end{aligned} \right.
\end{equation}
Meanwhile, the function $\phi_2$ is a complex-valued function that solves
\begin{equation}\label{DE for phi2}
    \left\{ \begin{aligned}
    &\partial_y\Big((U_{m,\gamma}(y)-c)^2\phi^2_1(y,m,\gamma,c_r,\lambda)\phi'_2(y,m,\gamma,c,\lambda)\Big)\\
    &\qquad \qquad \qquad +\dfrac{2ic_iU'_{m,\gamma}(y)(U_{m,\gamma}(y)-c)}{U_{m,\gamma}(y)-c_r}\phi_1(y,m,\gamma,c_r,\lambda)\phi'_1(y,m,\gamma,c_r,\lambda)\phi_2(y,m,\gamma,c,\lambda)=0,\\
    & \phi_2(y_c,m,\gamma,c,\lambda)=1\qquad \phi'_2(y_c,m,\gamma,c,\lambda)=0. 
\end{aligned} \right.
\end{equation}
Explicitly, $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ take the form
\begin{equation}\label{general expression of phi1}
\phi_1(y,m,c_r,\lambda)=1+\int_{y_c}^y \dfrac{-\lambda}{(U_{m,\gamma}(w)-c_r)^2}\int_{y_c}^{w}\phi_1(z,\lambda)(U_{m,\gamma}(z)-c_r)^2\;dz\;dw.
\end{equation}
and
\[
\begin{aligned}
    &\phi_2(y,m,\gamma,c,\lambda)=1\\
    &-2ic_i\int_{y_c}^y \dfrac{1}{(U_{m,\gamma}(w)-c)^2\phi^2_1(w,m,\gamma,c_r,\lambda)}\\
    &\quad\quad\quad\times \int_{y_c}^{w}\dfrac{U'_{m,\gamma}(z)(U_{m,\gamma}(z)-c)}{(U_{m,\gamma}(z)-c_r)}\phi'_1(z,m,\gamma,c,\lambda)\phi_1(z,m,\gamma,c,\lambda)\phi_2(z,m,\gamma,c,\lambda)\;dz\;dw.
\end{aligned}
\]
Moreover, we have the following estimates for $\phi_1$, $\phi_2$ and their derivatives,
\begin{align*}
    &1\leq \phi_1(y_1,m,\gamma,c_r,\lambda)\leq \phi_1(y_2,m,\gamma,c_r,\lambda)\quad \text{for}\quad |y_2-y_c|\geq |y_1-y_c|,\\
    &C^{-1}e^{C^{-1}\sqrt{-\lambda}|y-y_c|}\leq \phi_1(y,m,\gamma,c_r,\lambda)\leq Ce^{C\sqrt{-\lambda}|y-y_c|}\\
    &\phi_1(y,m,\gamma,c_r,\lambda)-1\leq C\min \{|\lambda||y-y_c|^2,1\}\phi_1(y,m,\gamma,c,\lambda)\\
    &\left|\frac{\partial_y\phi_1(y,m,\gamma,c_r,\lambda)}{\phi_1(y,m,\gamma,c_r,\lambda)}\right|\leq C\sqrt{-\lambda}|y-y_c|,\quad \left|\frac{\partial_{yy}\phi_1(y,m,\gamma,c_r,\lambda)}{\phi_1(y,m,\gamma,c_r,\lambda)}\right|\leq C|\lambda|
\end{align*}
and
\begin{align}
    &|\phi_{2}(y,m,\gamma,c,\lambda)-1|\le C\min \{\sqrt{-\lambda}|c_i|, |\lambda||y-y'|^2\},\label{eq-phi2-est-1}\\
      &|\partial_y\phi_{2}(y,m,\gamma,c,\lambda)|\le C|\lambda|\min \{c_i, |y-y'|\},\label{eq-phi2-est-2}\\
      & \|\partial_{yy}\phi_{2}(y,m,\gamma,c,\lambda)\|_{L^\infty_y}\le C|\lambda|,\label{eq-phi2-est-3}
  \end{align}

%\[
%\begin{aligned}
%    &\phi_1(y,m,c_r,\lambda)\geq 1,\qquad {\color{red}\phi'_1(y,m,c_r,\lambda)\leq \phi_1(y,m,c_r,\lambda)\text{should be better}},\\
%    &\lVert \phi_2(y,m,c,\lambda)-1 \rVert_{L^\infty_y} \leq C|c_i|, \qquad {\color{red}\lVert \phi'_2(y,m,c,\lambda)-1 \rVert_{L^\infty_y }\leq C|c_i|, \text{check}}\qquad \lVert\phi''_2(y,m,c,\lambda)\rVert_{L^\infty_y }\leq C.
%\end{aligned}
%\]
The constant $C$ is independent of $\gamma, y, y_c, m, \lambda,c$. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    The proof is omitted here. We refer reader to \cite[Proposition 5.3] {limasmoudizhao2022} for the estimate of $\phi_2(y,m,c,\lambda)$ and to \cite{WeiZhangZhao2015} for more accurate estimate of $\phi_1(y,m,c_r,\lambda)$. There, the authors presented a complete argument to obtain all the estimates. Note that the estimates relays only on the upper and lower bound of $U'_{m,\gamma}$ and $\|U''_{m,\gamma}(y)\|_{L^{\infty}_y}$. Thus the constant is independent of $\gamma$. 
\end{proof}

Earlier in \eqref{good derivative} we define the notion of good derivative denoted by $\partial_G$. Here, we present an estimate when the good derivative acts on the function $\phi_2$ from Lemma~\ref{phi1 phi2}.
\begin{comment}
\begin{lemma}\label{bound on the third derivative of phi1}
    For $\lambda=-1, c_r=0$, we have the following estimate
    \[
    |\phi^{'''}_1(y,m,0,-1)|\leq C, \qquad \bigg|\partial_y(\dfrac{\phi'_1(y,m,0,-1)}{U_{m,\gamma}(y)})\bigg| \leq C.
    \]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    From the integral form of $\phi_1$ in \eqref{general expression of phi1}, differentiating $\phi_1$ 3-times in terms of $y$ gives us
    \[
    \begin{aligned}
         \phi^{'''}_1(y,m,0,-1)
         &=\bigg[\dfrac{-2U''_{m,\gamma}(y)}{(U_{m,\gamma}(y))^3}+\dfrac{6(U'_{m,\gamma}(y))^2}{(U_{m,\gamma}(y))^4}\bigg] \int_{0}^{y}\phi_1(w,m,0,-1)(U_{m,\gamma}(w))^2\;dw\\
         &-\dfrac{2U'_{m,\gamma}(y)\phi_1(y,m,0,-1)}{(U_{m,\gamma}(y))}+\phi'_1(y,m,0,-1)\\
         &=\dfrac{-2U''_{m,\gamma}(y)}{(U_{m,\gamma}(y))^3}\int_{0}^{y}\phi_1(w,m,0,-1)(U_{m,\gamma}(w))^2\;dw\\
         &+\dfrac{6(U'_{m,\gamma}(y))^2}{(U_{m,\gamma}(y))^4}\int_{0}^{y}(\phi_1(w,m,0,-1)-1)(U_{m,\gamma}(w))^2\;dw \\
         &+\underbrace{\dfrac{6(U'_{m,\gamma}(y))^2}{(U_{m,\gamma}(y))^4}\int_{0}^{y}(U_{m,\gamma}(w))^2\;dw-\dfrac{2U'_{m,\gamma}(y)}{(U_{m,\gamma}(y))}}_{a}\\
         &-\dfrac{2U'_{m,\gamma}(y)(\phi_1(y,m,0,-1)-1)}{(U_{m,\gamma}(y))}+\phi'_1(y,m,0,-1).
    \end{aligned}
    \]
\begin{align*}
a&=\dfrac{2U'_{m,\gamma}(y)}{(U_{m,\gamma}(y))}\bigg(\dfrac{3(U'_{m,\gamma}(y))}{(U_{m,\gamma}(y))^3}\int_{0}^{y}(U_{m,\gamma}(w))^2\;dw-1\bigg)\\
&=\dfrac{2U'_{m,\gamma}(y)}{(U_{m,\gamma}(y))}\bigg(\int_{0}^{y}\dfrac{3(U'_{m,\gamma}(y)-U'_{m,\gamma}(w))(U_{m,\gamma}(w))^2}{(U_{m,\gamma}(y))^3}dw\bigg)
\end{align*}
which implies $|a|\leq C$ where constant $C$ is independent of $y,m,\gamma$. 
    One can see, therefore, via the boundedness of  $\phi_1$ and $\phi'_1$  we obtain
    \[
    |\phi^{'''}_1(y,m,0,-1)|\leq C.
    \]
    To obtain the second estimate, one can use the same integral formulation for $\phi_1$. Namely, differentiating $\phi_1$ \eqref{general expression of phi1} in $y$ and dividing the result by $U_{m,\gamma}$ yields
    \[
    \dfrac{\phi'_1(y,m,0,-1)}{U_{m,\gamma}(y)}=\dfrac{1}{U^3_{m,\gamma}(y)}\int_{0}^{y}\phi_1(w,m,0,-1)U^2_{m,\gamma}(w)\;dw.
    \]
    Differentiating the above expression in $y$ gives us
    \begin{equation}\label{ partial y phi1 prime over U}
        \begin{aligned}
     \partial_y\bigg(\dfrac{\phi'_1(y,m,0,-1)}{U_{m,\gamma}(y)}\bigg)&=\bigg(\dfrac{-3U'_{m,\gamma}(y)}{U^4_{m,\gamma}(y)}\int_{0}^{y}\phi_1(w,m,0,-1)U^2_{m,\gamma}(w)\;dw\bigg)+\dfrac{1}{U_{m,\gamma}(y)}\phi_1(y,m,0,-1)\\
     &=\dfrac{-3U'_{m,\gamma}(y)}{U^4_{m,\gamma}(y)}\int_{0}^{y}\Big(\phi_1(w,m,0,-1)-1\Big)U^2_{m,\gamma}(w)\;dw\\&
     \qquad \underbrace{-\dfrac{3U'_{m,\gamma}(y)}{U^4_{m,\gamma}(y)}\int_{0}^{y}U^2_{m,\gamma}(w)\;dw+\dfrac{1}{U_{m,\gamma}(y)}}_{b}\\&
     \qquad +\dfrac{1}{U_{m,\gamma}(y)}\Big(\phi_1(y,m,0,-1)-1\Big).
     \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}
     Further, notice that $b$ can be recast as
    \[
    \begin{aligned}
    b&=\dfrac{-1}{U_{m,\gamma}(y)}\bigg(\dfrac{3U'_{m,\gamma}(y)}{U^3_{m,\gamma}(y)}\int_{0}^{y}U^2_{m,\gamma}(w)\;dw-1\bigg)\\
    &=\dfrac{-1}{U_{m,\gamma}(y)}\int_{0}^{y}\dfrac{3\Big(U'_{m,\gamma}(y)-U'_{m,\gamma}(w)\Big)U^2_{m,\gamma}(w)}{U^3_{m,\gamma}(y)}\;dw.
    \end{aligned}
    \] Hence, we can infer that $|b|<C$. Looking back at the full expression in \eqref{ partial y phi1 prime over U}, and again, using the boundedness of $U_{m,\gamma},U_{m,\gamma}$ and $\phi_1$, we can conclude that 
    \[
    \bigg|\partial_y\bigg(\dfrac{\phi'_1(y,m,0,-1)}{U_{m,\gamma}(y)}\bigg)\bigg|\leq C.
    \]
    The constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ in both estimates may not be the same. They are also in fact indepedendent of $\gamma$ and $m$.
\end{proof}
\end{comment}
Let us now introduce $\phi_1^{E}(y,m,c,\lambda)=\phi_1(y,m,\gamma,c_r,\lambda)\phi_2(y,m,\gamma,c,\lambda)$. Note that $\phi_1^{E}(y,m,\gamma,c,\lambda)=\phi_1(y,m,\gamma,c_r,\lambda)$ for $c=c_r$, since $\phi_2(y,m,\gamma,c,\lambda)\equiv 1$ for $c=c_r$. One can regard $\phi_1^{E}(y,m,\gamma,c,\lambda)$ as the complex extension of $\phi_1(y,m,\gamma,c_r,\lambda)$. The next lemma gives a good property of $\phi_1^{E}(y,m,\gamma,c,\lambda)$ when the `good derivative' $\partial_{c_i}+i\frac{\partial_y}{U_{m,\gamma}'(0)}$ acts on it. We present the lemma by taking $c_r=0$ and $\lambda=-1$, which is used in the proof. 

\begin{lemma} [Estimates on $\partial_G \phi_1^E$ ]\label{partial G phi1}
Let $\phi_1^E(y,m,\gamma,c,\lambda)=\phi_1(y,m,\gamma,c_r,\lambda) \phi_2(y,m,\gamma,c,\lambda)$. For $c=ic_i$ and $\lambda=-1$, we have
\begin{equation}\label{estimate on the good derivative of phi1E}
\left| \frac{\partial_G \phi_1^{E}(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1) }{\phi_1^{E}(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)}\right|\leq C|y|^2,
\end{equation}
where the constant $C$ is independent of $\gamma,m,c$.
\end{lemma}
We remark that the same property holds for general $c$ and $\lambda$ by replacing the good derivative $\partial_G$ by $\partial_c+\frac{\partial_y}{U_{m,\gamma}'(y_c)}$. 
\begin{proof}
From Lemma~\ref{phi1 phi2}, we have $\phi_1^E(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)=\phi(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1) /(U_{m,\gamma}(y)-ic_i)$. As a consequence, $\phi_1^{E}(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)$ solves 

%We also know that 
%\[
%\bigg((U_{m,\gamma}(y)-c)\phi_1^E\bigg)''-\phi_1^E(U_{m,\gamma}(y)-c)=U''_{m,\gamma}(y)\phi_1(y),
%\] which gives us

%\begin{equation}\label{DE for phi1E}
%(U_{m,\gamma}(y)-c)(\phi_1^E)''+2U'_{m,\gamma}(y)%(\phi_1^E)'-\phi_1^E(U_{m,\gamma}(y)-c)=0.
%\end{equation}
%This is equivalent to saying that
\[
\bigg((U_{m,\gamma}(y)-ic_i)^2(\phi_1^E)'(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)\bigg)'=\phi_1^E(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)(U_{m,\gamma}(y)-ic_i)^2.
\]
Applying the good derivative $\partial_G$ to both sides of the above equation,
%yields
%\[
%\bigg(\partial_G\Big((U_{m,\gamma}(y)-c)^2(\phi_1^E)'\Big)\bigg)'=\partial_G\Big(\phi_1^E(U_{m,\gamma}(y)-c)^2\Big),
%\]which is equivalent to 
%\[
%\begin{aligned}
 %   \bigg(\dfrac{\partial_G\Big((U_{m,\gamma}(y)-c)^2\Big)}{(U_{m,\gamma}(y)-c)^2}&(U_{m,\gamma}(y)-c)^2(\phi_1^E)'\bigg)'+\bigg((U_{m,\gamma}(y)-c)^2\partial_G(\phi_1^E)'\bigg)'\\&=(\partial_G(\phi_1^E))(U_{m,\gamma}(y)-c)^2+\phi_1^E(U_{m,\gamma}(y)-c)^2\dfrac{\partial_G(U_{m,\gamma}(y)-c)^2}{(U_{m,\gamma}(y)-c)^2}.
%\end{aligned}
%\]
%Using equation \eqref{DE for phi1E}, 
we arrive at 
\begin{equation}\label{partial G DE}
    \begin{aligned}
   &\bigg((U_{m,\gamma}(y)-ic_i)^2\partial_G(\phi_1^E)'(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)\bigg)'\\&\quad=(\partial_G(\phi_1^E(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)))(U_{m,\gamma}(y)-ic_i)^2\\&\qquad- \bigg(\dfrac{\partial_G\Big((U_{m,\gamma}(y)-ic_i)^2\Big)}{(U_{m,\gamma}(y)-ic_i)^2}\bigg)'(U_{m,\gamma}(y)-ic_i)^2(\phi_1^E)'(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1).
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
%Let $\partial_G(\phi_1^E)=\mathfrak{A}\phi_1^E$, for some function $\mathcal{A}$. Diffentiating it both sides with respect to $y$ yields $\partial_G(\phi_1^E)'=(\mathfrak{A}\phi_1^E)'$. Relying on this, We can then simply equation \eqref{partial G DE} in which it now reads
Moreover, it is equivalent to saying that
\begin{equation}\label{good derivative phi1E}
    \begin{aligned}
   &\bigg((U_{m,\gamma}(y)-ic_i)^2\left(\frac{\partial_G\phi_1^E(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)}{\phi_1^E(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)}\right)'(\phi_1^E)^2(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)\bigg)'\\&\quad=- \bigg(\dfrac{\partial_G\Big((U_{m,\gamma}(y)-ic_i)^2\Big)}{(U_{m,\gamma}(y)-ic_i)^2}\bigg)'(U_{m,\gamma}(y)-ic_i)^2(\phi_1^E)'(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)\phi_1^E(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1).
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Solving for $\frac{\partial_G\phi_1^E}{\phi_1^E}$ gives us
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    &\frac{\partial_G\phi_1^E(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)}{\phi_1^E(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)}
    \\&\quad=-\int_{0}^y\dfrac{1}{(U_{m,\gamma}(w)-ic_i)^2(\phi_1^E)^2(w,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)}\\
    &\quad\quad\times\int_{0}^w\bigg(\dfrac{\partial_G\Big((U_{m,\gamma}(z)-ic_i)^2\Big)}{(U_{m,\gamma}(z)-ic_i)^2}\bigg)'(U_{m,\gamma}(z)-ic_i)^2(\phi_1^E)'(z,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)\phi_1^E(z,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)\;dz\;dw.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Let us take a closer look at the term above involving the good derivative,
\begin{equation}\label{expression of good derivative}
\begin{aligned}
\bigg|\bigg(\dfrac{\partial_G\Big((U_{m,\gamma}(z)-ic_i)^2\Big)}{(U_{m,\gamma}(z)-ic_i)^2}\bigg)'\bigg|&=\bigg|\dfrac{2\bigg(i\frac{U''_{m,\gamma}(z)}{U'_{m,\gamma}(0)}(U_{m,\gamma}(z)-ic_i)-(-i+i\frac{U'_{m,\gamma}(z)}{U'_{m,\gamma}(0)})U'_{m,\gamma}(z)\bigg)}{(U_{m,\gamma}(z)-ic_i)^2}\bigg|\\&
=\bigg|2\dfrac{\bigg(-c_i\frac{U''_{m,\gamma}(z)}{U'_{m,\gamma}(0)}+i\bigg(\frac{U''_{m,\gamma}(z)}{U'_{m,\gamma}(0)}U_{m,\gamma}(z)+U'_{m,\gamma}(z)-\frac{U'_{m,\gamma}(z)}{U'_{m,\gamma}(0)}U'_{m,\gamma}(z)\bigg)}{(U_{m,\gamma}(z)-ic_i)^2}\bigg|\\&
\leq 2\frac{\lVert U''_{m,\gamma}(z)\rVert_{L^{\infty}}\lVert U'_{m,\gamma}(z)\rVert_{L^{\infty}}}{U'_{m,\gamma}(0)}\dfrac{1}{|z|+|c_i|}.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

It is clear that the expression on the right hand side of \eqref{expression of good derivative} has one singularity at $(z,c_i)=(0,0)$. When plugging this term back into the integral in \eqref{good derivative phi1E}, the simple singularity of \eqref{expression of good derivative} in the integrand can be cancelled by the zero of $(\phi_1^E)'$. Moreover, all terms in the integrand are all bounded as a consequence of estimates in Lemma~\ref{phi1 phi2}. Therefore, the integral is well-defined. Altogether, we obtain the estimate \eqref{estimate on the good derivative of phi1E}. Hence, the proof is complete.\qedhere
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma} [Estimates on $\partial_m \phi_1^E$ ]\label{partial m phi1}
Let $\phi_1^E(y,m,\gamma,c,\lambda)=\phi_1(y,m,\gamma,c_r,\lambda) \phi_2(y,m,c,\lambda)$. For $c=ic_i$ and $\lambda=-1$, we have
\[
\left| \frac{\partial_m \phi_1^{E}(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1) }{\phi_1^{E}(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)}\right|\leq C\gamma|y|^2,
\]
with constant $C$ independent of $\gamma,m,c,y$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Here, the proof is a straight adaptation of the one in Lemma~\ref{partial G phi1}.
Again, from Lemma~\ref{phi1 phi2}, we have $\phi_1^E(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)=\phi(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1) /(U_{m,\gamma}(y)-ic_i)$. As a consequence, $\phi_1^{E}$ solves 

%We also know that 
%\[
%\bigg((U_{m,\gamma}(y)-c)\phi_1^E\bigg)''-\phi_1^E(U_{m,\gamma}(y)-c)=U''_{m,\gamma}(y)\phi_1(y),
%\] which gives us

%\begin{equation}\label{DE for phi1E}
%(U_{m,\gamma}(y)-c)(\phi_1^E)''+2U'_{m,\gamma}(y)%(\phi_1^E)'-\phi_1^E(U_{m,\gamma}(y)-c)=0.
%\end{equation}
%This is equivalent to saying that
\[
\bigg((U_{m,\gamma}(y)-ic_i)^2(\phi_1^E)'(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)\bigg)'=\phi_1^E(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)(U_{m,\gamma}(y)-ic_i)^2.
\]
Upon applying  $\partial_m$ to both sides of the above equation, we arrive at 
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
   &\bigg((U_{m,\gamma}(y)-ic_i)^2\partial_m(\phi_1^E)'(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)\bigg)'\\&
   =(\partial_m(\phi_1^E(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)))(U_{m,\gamma}(y)-ic_i)^2\\&- \bigg(\dfrac{\partial_m\Big((U_{m,\gamma}(y)-ic_i)^2\Big)}{(U_{m,\gamma}(y)-ic_i)^2}\bigg)'(U_{m,\gamma}(y)-ic_i)^2(\phi_1^E)'(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1).
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
%Let $\partial_G(\phi_1^E)=\mathfrak{A}\phi_1^E$, for some function $\mathcal{A}$. Diffentiating it both sides with respect to $y$ yields $\partial_G(\phi_1^E)'=(\mathfrak{A}\phi_1^E)'$. Relying on this, We can then simply equation \eqref{partial G DE} in which it now reads
Moreover, it is equivalent to saying that
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
   &\bigg((U_{m,\gamma}(y)-ic_i)^2\left(\frac{\partial_m\phi_1^E(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)}{\phi_1^E(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)}\right)'(\phi_1^E)^2(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)\bigg)'\\&\quad=- \bigg(\dfrac{\partial_m\Big((U_{m,\gamma}(y)-ic_i)^2\Big)}{(U_{m,\gamma}(y)-ic_i)^2}\bigg)'(U_{m,\gamma}(y)-ic_i)^2(\phi_1^E)'(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1)\phi_1^E(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1).
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Solving for $\frac{\partial_m\phi_1^E}{\phi_1^E}$ gives us
\[
\begin{aligned}
    &\frac{\partial_m\phi_1^E(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1))}{\phi_1^E(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1))}
    \\&\quad=-\int_{0}^y\dfrac{1}{(U_{m,\gamma}(w)-ic_i)^2)(\phi_1^E)^2(w,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1))}\\
    &\quad\quad\times\int_{0}^w\bigg(\dfrac{\partial_m\Big((U_{m,\gamma}(z)-ic_i)^2\Big)}{(U_{m,\gamma}(z)-ic_i)^2}\bigg)'(U_{m,\gamma}(z)-ic_i)^2(\phi_1^E)'(z,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1))\phi_1^E(z,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1))\;dz\;dw.
\end{aligned}
\] 
Direct computation tells us that
\[
\begin{aligned}
    \bigg|\bigg(\dfrac{\partial_m\Big((U_{m,\gamma}(z)-ic_i)^2\Big)}{(U_{m,\gamma}(z)-ic_i)^2}\bigg)'\bigg|&\leq \lVert\Gamma \rVert_{L^{\infty}} \dfrac{\bigg|2\gamma \bigg((U_{m,\gamma}(z)-ic_i)+\gamma z U'_{m,\gamma}(z)\bigg)\bigg|}{(U_{m,\gamma}(z)-ic_i)^2}\\&
    \leq 2\gamma \lVert\Gamma \rVert_{L^{\infty}} \dfrac{\Big|\lVert U'_{m,\gamma}(z)\rVert_{L^{\infty}}\Big|}{|z|+|c_i|}.
\end{aligned}
\]

Observe that the term above has one singularity. In particular, upon plugging in this estimate into the inner integral in the expression of $\partial_m\phi_1^E/\phi_1^E$, the singularity in the inner integrand will be cancelled by the zero of $(\phi_1^E)'$. Further, the two singularities in the outter integrand can be overcome by the two zeros of $(U_{m,\gamma}(z)-ic_i)^2$. This results in the integral to be well-defined. Hence, we arrive at
\[
\bigg|\frac{\partial_m\phi_1^E(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1))}{\phi_1^E(y,m,\gamma,ic_i,-1))}\bigg|\leq C \gamma y^2.
\]
We would like to remark that the constant $C$ is independent of $\gamma$ and obtained by using the estimates in Lemma~\ref{phi1 phi2}. Hence, the proof is complete. \qedhere
\end{proof}

\begin{comment}
\begin{lemma}\label{bounds on phi1 and its fraction}
Let $T(y)=\dfrac{\phi_1'(y)}{\phi_1(y)}$, where $\phi_1$ is as stated in \eqref{phi1}. Then the following estimates hold:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}\label{bounds for phi_1 and its fraction}
    e^{-\sqrt{-\lambda_m}|y|}&\leq \phi_1(y)\leq e^{\sqrt{-\lambda_m}|y|}\\
    e^{-\sqrt{-\lambda_m}|y-w|}&\leq \dfrac{\phi_1(w)}{\phi_1(y)}\leq e^{\sqrt{-\lambda_m}|y-w|}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Using the fact that $\phi_1$ satisfies the equation
\[
    \bigg(U^2 \phi_1'\bigg)'=-\lambda_m\phi_1 U^2,
\]
    one can easily check that $T$ satisfies
\begin{equation}\label{T}
    T'(y)+T^2(y)+2\dfrac{U'}{U}T(y)+\lambda_m=0.
\end{equation}
Further, exploiting the expression of $\phi_1$ in \eqref{phi1} we know that
\[
    \phi_1(0)=1\text{ and } \phi'_1(0)=0,
\]
from which we can infer $T(0)=0$. Additionally, it is straightforward to see from \eqref{T} that as $y\to 0$, $T'(y)$ enjoys the following limiting behavior
\[
\begin{aligned}
    \lim_{y\to 0}T'(y)&=-\lambda_m-\lim_{y\to 0}T^2(y)-\lim_{y\to 0}2\dfrac{U'}{U}T(y)\\
                    &=-\lambda_m-2\lim_{y\to 0}T'(y).
\end{aligned}
\]
Hence, $T'(0)=\frac{-\lambda_m}{3}>0.$ Our goal is to get a precise bound on $T$ that wil then lead us to the estimate stated in the lemma. For that, we need to make another observation on $\phi_1$, that is
\[
\phi_1'(y)>0 \text{ for } y>0, \text{ and } \phi_1'(y)<0\text{ for } y>0. 
\]
As a result, 
\[
\phi_(w)\geq\phi(y) \text{ for any } w \in [y,0] \text{ or }  w \in [0,y].
\]
Recalling the fact that $U(0)=0$ and $U'(y)>0$, we can conclude $\frac{T(y)}{U(y)}\geq 0$ for $y\in[-1,1].$

Moreover, one has
\[
|T(y)|=\bigg|\dfrac{\phi'(y)}{\phi(y)} \bigg|=\bigg|\dfrac{\lambda_m}{U(y)}\int_0^{y}\dfrac{\phi_1(z)}{\phi_1(y)}U^2(z) \;dz\bigg|\lesssim |\lambda_m||y|.
\]
Furthermore, let suppose that $T$ attains its maximum somewhere at $y_*\in [-1,1]$ (i.e. $T'(y_*)=0$). Without loss of generality, we assume that $y_*\geq 0$ then from \eqref{T} we obtain
\[
T^2(y_*)=-\lambda_m-2\dfrac{U'(y_*)}{U(y_*)}T(y_*)\leq |\lambda_m|.
\]

Combining both estimates, we conclude that 
\begin{equation}\label{bound on T}
    |T(y)|=\bigg|\dfrac{\phi_1'(y)}{\phi_1(y)}\bigg|\leq \sqrt{-\lambda_m}.
\end{equation}
As a consequence, both inequalities in \eqref{bounds for phi_1 and its fraction} follow directly from \eqref{bound on T}. 
\end{proof}
\end{comment}

\begin{lemma}\label{F}
    Consider the function $\phi_1$ in \eqref{phi1}. It follows that 
    \[
    -C_1\dfrac{y^2}{\sqrt{-\lambda}}\geq \dfrac{\partial_\lambda \phi_1(y,m,\gamma,c_r,\lambda)}{\phi_1(y,m,\gamma,c_r,\lambda)}\geq -C_0\dfrac{y^2}{\sqrt{-\lambda}},
    \]
for some positive constants $C_1$ and $C_0$. In addition, we have the following estimate for $|\partial_\lambda m|$,
\begin{equation}
|\partial_\lambda m| \approx \Big( 1-e^{-2 \sqrt{-\lambda}}\Big).
\end{equation}
where $\partial_\lambda m$ is given by \eqref{monotonicity of m}.
\end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        Recall that $\phi_1$ solves the equation \eqref{differential equation for phi1}. Differentiating \eqref{differential equation for phi1}  with respect to $\lambda$ yields
\begin{equation} \label{DE for partial lambda phi1}
(U^2(y) \partial_{\lambda}\phi'_1(y,m,\gamma,c_r,\lambda))'=-\lambda\partial_{\lambda} \phi_1(y,m,\gamma,c_r,\lambda)U^2-\phi_1(y,m,\gamma,c_r,\lambda) U^2(y).
\end{equation}
We think of $\partial_\lambda \phi_1$ as the unknown and consider the ansatz  \begin{equation}\label{ansatz for DE partial lambda phi1}
    \partial_{\lambda} \phi_1(y,m,\gamma,c_r,\lambda)= F(\phi_1,y)\phi_1(y,m,\gamma,c_r,\lambda)
\end{equation} for \eqref{DE for partial lambda phi1} . Plugging it into  \eqref{DE for partial lambda phi1} gives
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
&-\lambda F(\phi_1,y) \phi_1(y,m,\gamma,c_r,\lambda) U^2(y) -\phi_1(y,m,\gamma,c_r,\lambda) U^2(y)\\&\qquad=(U^2(y)F'(\phi_1,y)\phi_1(y,m,\gamma,c_r,\lambda) )'+(U^2(y) F(\phi_1,y) \phi'_1(y,m,\gamma,c_r,\lambda) )'\\
                                                      &\qquad=(U^2(y)F'(\phi_1,y)\phi_1(y,m,\gamma,c_r,\lambda) )'+(U^2(y) \phi'_1)'F(\phi_1,y) +U^2(y) F'(\phi_1,y)\phi'_1(y,m,\gamma,c_r,\lambda) \\
                                                      &\qquad=(U^2(y)F'(\phi_1,y)\phi_1)'-\lambda F(\phi_1,y)\phi_1(y,m,\gamma,c_r,\lambda)  U^2(y)+U^2(y) F'(\phi_1,y)\phi'_1(y,m,\gamma,c_r,\lambda) ,
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
from which we can say
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
0&=(U^2(y))'F'(\phi_1,y) \phi^2_1(y,m,\gamma,c_r,\lambda)+U^2(y) F''(\phi_1,y) \phi^2_1(y,m,\gamma,c_r,\lambda)\\&\qquad +2U^2(y)F'(\phi_1,y) \phi'_1(y,m,\gamma,c_r,\lambda)\phi_1(y,m,\gamma,c_r,\lambda)+\phi^2_1(y,m,\gamma,c_r,\lambda)U^2(y)\\
&=(U^2(y) F'(\phi_1,y) \phi^2_1(y,m,\gamma,c_r,\lambda))'+\phi^2_1(y,m,\gamma,c_r,\lambda) U^2(y).
\end{aligned}
\end{equation} Straightforward computation yields
\begin{equation}
F(\phi_1,y)=-\int_0^y\dfrac{\int_{0}^{w}\phi^2_1(y,m,\gamma,c_r,\lambda) U^2(z) \; dz}{U^2(w) \phi^2_1(y,m,\gamma,c_r,\lambda)}\;dw\leq 0.
\end{equation}

Furthermore, we compute more precise upper and lower bounds of $F$. Without lost of generality, we assume that $w>0$ (i.e. $0\leq z<w$). Hence, we deduce the lower bound for $F$:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
0&\geq- \int_0^y\int_{0}^{w}\dfrac{\phi^2_1(z,m,\gamma,c_r,\lambda)U^2(z) \; dz}{U^2(w) \phi^2_1(w,m,\gamma,c_r,\lambda)}\;dw\\
  &\geq- \int_0^y\int_{0}^{w}e^{-\sqrt{-\lambda}|w-z|}\dfrac{U^2(z) \; dz}{U^2(w)}\;dw
  \geq \dfrac{y^2}{-\sqrt{-\lambda}},
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where we have used the inequality for $\phi_1$ in Lemma~\ref{phi1 phi2}. In the case when $w<0$, the same argument holds. Again, via a straightforward computation using the estimate for $\phi_1$ in Lemma~\ref{phi1 phi2}, we obtain an upper bound of $F$, namely $F \leq -C y^2/ \sqrt{-\lambda}$, where $C$ is some constant. Combining both bounds, we get
\begin{equation}\label{estimate for A}
-C_1\dfrac{y^2}{\sqrt{-\lambda}}\geq F \geq -C_0\dfrac{y^2}{\sqrt{-\lambda}}.
\end{equation}

Having obtained the estimate for $F$, we now proceed to derive the bound for $\partial_{\lambda} m$. We list out a number of inequalities that are useful for the derivation. First, we present a lower bound for $\partial_{\lambda} m$,

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
|\partial_{\lambda} m| \gtrsim \int_{-1}^1 \dfrac{1}{\phi_1^2} \; dy &\gtrsim \Bigg( \int_{-1}^0 e^{2 \sqrt{-\lambda}y}\;dy + \int_{0}^1e^{-2 \sqrt{-\lambda}y}\;dy\Bigg)\\
&\gtrsim \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{-\lambda}} \bigg( 1-e^{-2 \sqrt{-\lambda}}\bigg).
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Via the same computations, we show that $\partial_{\lambda}m$ satisfies the following upper bound
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
|\partial_{\lambda} m| \lesssim \int_{-1}^1 \dfrac{1}{\phi_1^2} \; dy &\lesssim \Bigg( \int_{-1}^0 e^{2 \sqrt{-\lambda}y}\;dy + \int_{0}^1e^{-2 \sqrt{-\lambda}y}\;dy\Bigg)\\
&\lesssim \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{-\lambda}} \bigg( 1-e^{-2 \sqrt{-\lambda}}\bigg).
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Finally, using all inequalities displayed above and inserting them into the expression in \eqref{monotonicity of m} gives us
\begin{equation}
|\partial_\lambda m| \approx \bigg( 1-e^{-2 \sqrt{-\lambda}}\bigg).
\end{equation}
\end{proof}
\begin{comment}
\begin{lemma}\label{convergence of wronskian}
Fix $m=m_\infty$. The Wronskian satisfies the following uniform convergence
\[
W(c_n,m_\infty) \to \dfrac{1}{U'_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}(y_{c_n})}\Bigg(\mathbb{A}(c_r)-i\mathbb{B}(c_r)\Bigg),\quad \text{as } c_{n_{i}}\to 0,
\]
where
\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{A}&=\int_{-1}^{1} \dfrac{U'_{\gamma_0,m_\infty(y_{c_n})}}{(U_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}-c_{n_r})^2}\Bigg( \dfrac{1}{\phi^2(y,c_{n_r})}-1\Bigg)\;dy+\dfrac{U_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}(1)-U_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}(-1)}{\bigg(U_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}(1)-c_{n_r}\bigg)\bigg(U_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}(-1)-c_{n_r}\bigg)}\\
&\qquad +\text{P.V.} \int_{-1}^1 \dfrac{R(y)}{(U_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}-c_r)^2}\;dy+\ln{\dfrac{(U_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}(1)-c_{n_r})}{(U_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}(-1)-c_{n_r})}},\\
\mathbb{B}&=\pi\dfrac{U''_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}(y_{c_n})}{U'_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}(y_{c_n})^2}.  
\end{aligned}
\]
\begin{proof}
    First, we follow the splitting idea as before
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    \int_{-1}^{1} \dfrac{1}{\phi^2(y,c_n)}\;dy&=\int_{-1}^{1} \dfrac{1}{(U_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}-c_n)^2\phi^2(y,c_n)}\;dy\\
    &=\int_{-1}^{1} \dfrac{1}{(U_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}-c_n)^2}\;dy + \int_{-1}^{1} \dfrac{1}{(U_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}-c_n)^2}\Bigg( \dfrac{1}{\phi^2(y,c_n)}-1\Bigg)\;dy.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
By Lebesgue Dominated Convergence Theorem, we have
\[\lim_{c_{n_{i}}\to 0} \int_{-1}^{1} \dfrac{1}{(U_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}-c_n)^2}\Bigg( \dfrac{1}{\phi^2(y,c_n)}-1\Bigg)\;dy= \int_{-1}^{1} \dfrac{1}{(U_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}-c_{n_r})^2}\Bigg( \dfrac{1}{\phi^2(y,c_{n_r})}-1\Bigg)\;dy
\]
Furthermore, using the fact that $U'(y_{c_n})>0$, we have
\[
\int_{-1}^{1} \dfrac{1}{(U_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}-c_n)^2}\;dy=\dfrac{1}{U'_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}(y_{c_n})}\Bigg(\underbrace{\int_{-1}^1 \dfrac{U'_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}}{(U_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}-c_n)^2}\;dy}_{\text{I}}-\underbrace{\int_{-1}^1 \dfrac{U'_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}-U'_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}(y_{c_n})}{(U_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}-c_n)^2}\;dy}_{\text{II}}\Bigg).
\]
Observe that as $c_{n_i}\to 0$,
$\text{I}\to \dfrac{U_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}(1)-U_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}(-1)}{\bigg(U_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}(1)-c_{n_r}\bigg)\bigg(U_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}(-1)-c_{n_r}\bigg)}$. Furthermore, we can express $\text{II}$ in the following way:
\[
\text{II}=\underbrace{\int_{-1}^1\dfrac{R(y)}{(U_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}-c_n)^2}\;dy}_{\text{II}_1}+\dfrac{U''_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}(y_{c_n})}{U'_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}(y_{c_n})^2}\underbrace{\int_{-1}^1\dfrac{U'_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}(U_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}-c_r)}{(U_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}-c_n)^2}\;dy}_{\text{II}_2},
\]
where
\[
R(y)=U'_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}-U'_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}(y_{c_n})-\dfrac{U''_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}(y_{c_n})}{U_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}(y_{c_n})}U'_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}(U_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}-c_r).
\]
It is easy to see that $R(y_{c_n})=R'(y_{c_n})=0$. As a result, $|R'(y)|=|R'(y)-R'(y_{c_n}|\leq C|y-y_{c_n}|$. Hence, we can again apply L.D.C.T. and infer that as $c_i\to 0$
\[
\text{II}_1=\int_{-1}^1 \dfrac{R(y)}{(U_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}-c_n)^2} \;dy \to \text{P.V.} \int_{-1}^1 \dfrac{R(y)}{(U_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}-c_r)^2}\;dy.
\]
It remains to investigate the convergence of $\text{II}_2$. Via change of variables, the expression of $\text{II}_2$ becomes
\[
\begin{aligned}
\text{II}_2&=\int_{U_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}(-1)-c_n}^{U_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}(1)-c_n} \dfrac{z+ic_{n_i}}{z^2}\;dz=\ln{\dfrac{U_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}(1)-c_n}{U_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}(-1)-c_n}}+ic_{n_i}\bigg(U_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}(-1)-U_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}(1)\bigg).
\end{aligned}
\]
Taking $c_{n_i}\to 0$,
\[
\text{II}_2\to \ln{\dfrac{U_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}(1)-c_{n_r}}{U_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}(-1)-c_{n_r}}}+i\pi.
\]
Altogether, this tells us that
\[
\text{II}\to  \text{P.V.} \int_{-1}^1 \dfrac{R(y)}{(U_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}-c_r)^2}\;dy+ \dfrac{U''_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}(y_{c_n})}{U'_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}(y_{c_n})^2} \Bigg(\ln{\dfrac{U_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}(1)-c_{n_r}}{U_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}(-1)-c_{n_r}}}\Bigg)+i\pi\dfrac{U''_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}(y_{c_n})}{U'_{\gamma_0,m_\infty}(y_{c_n})^2}
\]
\end{proof}

\end{comment}

Next, we present you a lemma that provides a useful estimate in computing the bounds for $\partial_{c_i}W$ and $\partial_m W$. 
\begin{lemma} \label{Supremum estimate}
    Let $a<0<b$, for all $f\in H^{1}(a,b)$, we have the following estimate
    \begin{equation}
        \sup_{c_i\in (0,1]}\left|\int_{a}^{b} \dfrac{1}{v-ic_i} f(v)\;dv\right|\lesssim \lVert f \rVert^{1/2}_{L^2}\bigg(\lVert f' \rVert^{1/2}_{L^2}+\lVert f \rVert^{1/2}_{L^\infty}\bigg).
    \end{equation}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Define the following integral operator
    \[
    T_{c_i,a,b}f(v):=\int_{a}^b \dfrac{1}{v-w+ic_i}f(w)\;dw. 
    \]
Hence,
\begin{equation} \label{bound on A}
   \begin{aligned}
       &\sup_{c_i\in(0,1]}\left|p.v.\int_{a}^{b} \dfrac{1}{v-ic_i} f(v)\;dv\right|\leq \sup_{\substack{c_i \in (0,1] \\ v \in [\frac{a}{2},\frac{b}{2}]}}\Big|T_{c_i,a,b}f(v)\Big|\\ 
       &\lesssim \sup_{c_i \in (0,1]}\bigg(\lVert T_{c_i,a,b}f (v)\rVert^{1/2}_{L^2_v}\lVert \partial_v T_{c_i,a,b}f(v) \rVert^{1/2}_{L^2_v} + \lVert T_{c_i,a,b}f(v)\rVert_{L^2_v}\bigg). 
   \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Observe that via integration by parts, we obtain
\[
\partial_v T_{c_i,a,b}f(v)=\dfrac{1}{v-b+ic_i}f(b)-\dfrac{1}{v-a+ic_i}f(a)+T_{c_i,a,b}(f'(v)).
\] Moreover, we have the following estimates:
\[
\begin{aligned}
    \sup_{c_i\in (0,1]}\lVert T_{c_i,a,b}f(v) \rVert_{L^2_v} &\lesssim \lVert f(v) \rVert_{L^2_v},\\
    \sup_{c_i\in (0,1]}\lVert \partial_v T_{c_i,a,b}f(v) \rVert_{L^2_v} &\lesssim \lVert f(v) \rVert_{L^\infty_v}+\sup_{\substack{c_i \in (0,1] }}\Big\| T_{c_i,a,b} f'(v) \Big\|_{L^2}\\
    &\lesssim \lVert f(v) \rVert_{L^\infty_v} +\sup_{c_i\in(0,1]} \lVert f'(v) \rVert_{L^2}.
\end{aligned}
\]
Combining all these estimates and plug them back into \eqref{bound on A} gives the desired bound in the statement of the lemma. \qedhere
\end{proof}

\section{Regularity}\label{Regularity}
Next, this appendix concerns the regularity of the background flow and the map $G$ or its extension $\widetilde{G}$. Observe that the assumptions on $\mathcal{U}$ in the lemma is generic. We also do not assume any oddness or eveness on $\mathcal{U}$. We demand that $\mathcal{U}$ and its even derivatives (if exist) to vanish at $y=0$. The regularity used for $\mathcal{U}$ is also weaker compared to the one in \cite{LinZeng2011}.

In practice, when employing the bifurcation argument, we shall specify $(\mathcal{U}(y),0)$; we deal with the background shear $(U_{m,\gamma}(y),0)$. It is important to note that the conclusion on the higher regularity on $\widetilde{G}$ in this lemma is used to obtain the higher regularity result in Lemma~\ref{Bifurcation}.

\allowdisplaybreaks
\begin{lemma}\label{regularity lemma}
 Fix $N \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \cup \{0\}$. Suppose that $\mathcal{U} \in C^{2N+3}(-1,1)$, $\mathcal{U}'>c_0>0$, $\mathcal{U}(0)=0$, $\mathcal{U}^{(2j)}(0)=0$ for $j=1,2,...N,N+1$, and $-C_0<\mathcal{U}''/\mathcal{U}<0$ for some $c_0, C_0>0$. Consider a function $\widetilde{\psi}_0$ obtained by modifying the background stream function
\begin{equation}\label{definition of tilde psi}
\widetilde{\psi}_0(y):=\left\{ \begin{aligned}
\psi_0(y)\; &\text{for } y\geq0,\\
-\psi_0(y)\; &\text{for } y<0,
\end{aligned} \right.
\end{equation}
where $\int_{0}^y \mathcal{U}(z)\;dz=\psi_0(y)$.
If  $G(\widetilde{\psi_0}(y))=\mathcal{U}'(y)$, then $G(\widetilde{\psi_0}(y))\in C^{N+1}(-1,1).$
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let $\psi_0$ be the associated stream function of the background shear flow $(\mathcal{U},0)$. Since, $\mathcal{U}\in C^{2N+3}(-1,1)$, then $\psi_0 \in C^{2N+4}(-1,1).$ Further, from the monotonicity of $\mathcal{U}$ and the fact that $\mathcal{U}(0)=0,$ we can easily infer that $\mathcal{U}(y)<0$ for all $y\in[-1,0)$ and $\mathcal{U}(y)>0$ for all $y\in(0,1].$ As a result, the background stream function $\psi_0$ is decreasing on [-1,0] and increasing on [0,1]. Thus, $\widetilde{\psi}_0$ is increasing on $[-1,1]$. 

 Our method relies on the mathematical induction argument subject to the regularity exponent $N$. As the base case, we assume that 
 $N=0$. This is equivalent to saying that $\mathcal{U}\in C^3(-1,1)$. Differentiating $G$ in $y$ yields $G'(\widetilde{\psi}_0(y))= \mathcal{U}''(y)/\widetilde{\psi}_0'(y)$. Away from $y=0$, $G'(\widetilde{\psi}_0(y))$ is clearly well-defined. The subtlety occurs at $y=0$ 
as expected due to the definition of $\widetilde{\psi}_0$ in \eqref{definition of tilde psi}. In other words, we need to show that $\lim_{y\to 0^+}G'(\psi_0(y)$ and $\lim_{y\to 0^-}G'(-\psi_0(y)))$  exist and are  both equal. To prove this, we use the Taylor expansion of $\psi_0$ around $y=0$
\[
\psi_0(y)=\frac{\psi_0''(0)}{2}y^2+\frac{\psi_0^{(4)}(0)}{24}y^4+R(y):=F(y^2)+R(y),
\] where we have used the fact that $\mathcal{U}(0)=\mathcal{U}''(0)=0.$ Hence, the first derivative of $G$ can be expressed as follows
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
G'(\psi_0)&=\dfrac{\bigg(2F'(y^2)+4y^2F''(y^2)+R''(y)\bigg)'}{2yF'(y^2)+R'(y)}\\
                &=\dfrac{\bigg(w(y^2)+R''(y)\bigg)'}{2yF'(y^2)+R'(y)}\\
                &=\dfrac{w'(y^2)+\frac{R'''(y)}{2y}}{F'(y^2)+\frac{R'(y)}{2y}}:=\dfrac{a_1(y^2)+b_1(y)}{c_1(y^2)+d_1(y)}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*} 
where we have done another grouping of terms and call it $w(y^2)$. Note that $\frac{R'''(y)}{2y}$ and $\frac{R'(y)}{2y}$ vanish as $y\to0^+$. Therefore, it is straightforward to see that $\lim_{y\to 0^+}G'(\psi_0(y))$ exists. Replacing $\psi_0$ by $-\psi_0$ and going through the same computation as above, we conclude that $\lim_{y\to 0^-}G'(-\psi_0(y))$ exists and is equal to $\lim_{y\to 0^+}G'(\psi_0(y))$. Hence $G\in C^1(\min \widetilde{\psi_0} ,\max \widetilde{\psi_0}).$ 

Now, we set $N=1$. Again, using the Taylor expansion of $\psi_0$, we obtain
 \begin{equation}
 \begin{aligned}
 G''(\psi_0(y))&=\dfrac{1}{\psi_0'}\bigg(\dfrac{a_1(y^2)+b_1(y)}{c_1(y^2)+d_1(y)}\bigg)'=\dfrac{1}{\psi_0'}\bigg(\dfrac{w'(y^2)+\frac{R'''(y)}{2y}}{F'(y^2)+\frac{R'(y)}{2y}}\bigg)'\\
                          &=\dfrac{1}{\psi_0'}\dfrac{2yw''(y^2)F'(y^2)+F'(y^2)(\frac{R'''}{2y})'+\frac{R'}{2y}2yw''(y^2)+\frac{R'}{2y}(\frac{R'''}{2y})'}{(F'(y^2)+\frac{R'}{2y})^2}\\&\qquad-\dfrac{2yw'(y^2)F''(y^2)+w'(y^2)(\frac{R'}{2y})'+\frac{R'''}{2y}2yF''(y^2)+\frac{R'''}{2y}(\frac{R'}{2y})'}{(F'(y^2)+\frac{R'}{2y})^2}\\
                           &=\dfrac{1}{\psi_0'}\dfrac{2yp(y^2)+q(y)}{r'(y^2)+s(y)}\\
                           &=\dfrac{1}{\big(F'(y^2)+\frac{R'(y)}{2y}\big)}\dfrac{p(y^2)+\frac{q(y)}{2y}}{r'(y^2)+s(y)}=:=\dfrac{a_2(y^2)+b_2(y)}{c_2(y^2)+d_2(y)}.
 \end{aligned}
 \end{equation}

For the sake of induction, we suppose that for $N=2,3,...n-1$ and $\mathcal{U} \in C^{2N+3}$, we have $G \in C^{N+1}$ with
\begin{equation*}
G^{(n)}(\psi_0(y))=\dfrac{1}{2yF'(y^2)+R'(y)}\Bigg(\dfrac{a_{n-1}(y^2)+b_{n-1}(y)}{c_{n-1}(y^2)+d_{n-1}(y)}\Bigg)',
\end{equation*}
where we have arranged terms such that $b_{n-1}$ and $d_{n-1}$ contains all terms consisting of $R$ and its higher derivatives coming from the Taylor expansion of $\psi_0$. With 
this in mind, we can explicitly represent $G^{(n)}$ as follows:
\begin{equation}\label{n-th derivative}
G^{(n)}(\psi_0(y))=\dfrac{a_n(y^2)+b_n(y)}{c_n(y^2)+d_n(y)}
\end{equation}
for some $a_n, b_n, c_n,$ and $d_n$ with $b_n(y), d_n(y) \to 0, a_n(y^2)\to a_n(0), c_n(y)\to c_n(0)$  as $y\to 0.$
 
Now, suppose that $N=n$, we show that for $\mathcal{U} \in C^{2n+3}$ satisfying the hypothesis in the lemma, we have $G\in C^{n+1}$. We begin by writing the $n+1$ derivative of $G(\psi_0)$ for $y>0$. Again, this derivative is well-defined due to the regularity of $\mathcal{U}$. Differentiating \eqref{n-th derivative}, we obtain
 \begin{equation}
 \begin{aligned}
 &G^{(n+1)}(\psi_0(y))\\&=\dfrac{1}{\psi_0'}\dfrac{\bigg(c_n(y^2)+d_n(y)\bigg)\bigg(2ya_n'(y^2)+b_n'(y)\bigg)-\bigg(a_n(y^2)+b_n(y)\bigg)\bigg(2yc_n'(y^2)+d_n'(y)\bigg)}{c_n^2(y^2)+2c_n(y^2)d_n(y)+d_n^2(y)}
 \end{aligned}
 \end{equation}
 By the same regrouping idea, we can write 
 \begin{equation*}
 G^{(n+1)}(\psi_0(y))=\dfrac{a_{n+1}(y^2)+b_{n+1}(y)}{c_{n+1}(y^2)+d_{n+1}(y)},
 \end{equation*}
 for some $a_{n+1}, b_{n+1}, c_{n+1}, d_{n+1}$. One can easily check that both $b_{n+1}(y)$ and $d_{n+1}(y)$ decay as $y\to 0$. Hence, $\lim_{y\to 0}G^{(n+1)}(\psi_0(y))$ exists. Therefore, we have shown that $G \in C^{n+1}$. The proof is complete. \qedhere

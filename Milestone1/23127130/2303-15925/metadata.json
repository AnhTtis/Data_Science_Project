    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the generation of eigenvalues of a stable monotonic shear flow under perturbations in $C^s$ with $s<2$. More precisely, we study the Rayleigh operator $\\mathcal{L}_{U_{m,γ}}= U_{m,γ}\\partial_x-U''_{m,γ}\\partial_xΔ^{-1}$ associated with perturbed shear flow $(U_{m,γ}(y),0)$ in a finite channel $\\mathbb{T}_{2π}\\times [-1,1]$ where $U_{m,γ}(y)=U(y)+mγ^2\\widetildeΓ(y/γ)$ with $U(y)$ being a stable monotonic shear flow and $\\big\\{mγ^2\\widetildeΓ(y/γ)\\big\\}_{m\\geq 0}$ being a family of perturbations parameterized by $m$. We prove that there exists $m_*$ such that for $0\\leq m<m_*$, the Rayleigh operator has no eigenvalue or embedded eigenvalue, therefore linear inviscid damping holds. Otherwise, instability occurs when $m\\geq m_*$. Moreover, at the nonlinear level, we show that asymptotic instability holds for $m$ near $m_*$ and a growing mode exists for $m>m_*$ which also leads to instability.",

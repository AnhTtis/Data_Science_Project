    "abstract": "A quantum network is expected to enhance distributed quantum computing and quantum communication over a long distance while providing unconditional security. As quantum entanglement is essential for a quantum network, major issues from various types of noise and decoherence prevent it from being realized, and research has been intensively active to obtain optimal configurations for a quantum network. In this work, we address the performance of a quantum network capable of quantum error correction and entanglement purification. Our results show that one should distribute Bell pairs as fast as possible while balancing the deployment of fidelity enhancement. We also show suitable hybrid strategies in quantum cryptography tasks under some noise regimes that need to use purification and quantum error correction together. Our results suggest that using purification to distribute high fidelity Bell pairs and preserving them for application using quantum error correction is a promising way to achieve a near-term quantum network for secure communication.",

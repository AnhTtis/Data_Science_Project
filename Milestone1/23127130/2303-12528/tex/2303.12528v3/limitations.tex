\section*{Limitations}

Although we compare the evaluation results of DV003 with BLOOMZ and SOTA models, we could not evaluate closed models such as PaLM, which also contains training data in many languages. A limitation of our study is that we do not evaluate on all the multilingual datasets that are available, and we plan to scale up our evaluation in future versions of the study with the help of the research community. Even if we do evaluate on all available multilingual datasets, they do not cover many typologically diverse and under-resourced languages, which is a fundamental limitation of trying to scale up multilingual evaluation today. For example, there is very little representation from African languages, Indigenous languages of the Americas etc. in any of the evaluation benchmarks available today. Finally, we restrict ourselves to the accuracy dimension of evaluation for this study - however, we plan to include evaluation of toxicity, bias, robustness etc. in future versions.

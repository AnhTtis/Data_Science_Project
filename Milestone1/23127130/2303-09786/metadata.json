    "abstract": "To describe the pre- and post-selected quantum ensembles, a complex quantity called the weak value of an operator is used. The weak value is highly controversial due to the fact that it is not bounded by the possible eigenvalues of the corresponding operator. Nevertheless, the obtaining of the anomalous weak value is regarded as a powerful technique in the quantum interferometry nowadays. Here it is shown that the postselection on a quantum system recovers a completely hidden interference effect in the measurement apparatus. Studying the interference pattern shows the optimal settings for the amplification and the parameter estimation. It also proves that the weak value is not an element of reality. Using single photons, it is investigated how a postselected photon can impart a $π$ phase shift (the peak of the amplification) to a photon interacting weakly with it in a nonlinear optical medium. The increasing of the degree of the entanglement lies behind the effectiveness of the postselection in the parameter estimation. In particular, arranging to postselect on pure entangled states can optimize the signal-to-noise ratio, allowing to achieve high-sensitive measurements using low input power.",

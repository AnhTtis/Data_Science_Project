\section{Conclusion}
Our work, GeoSpark, aims to utilize explicit geometry guidance to enhance feature learning and downsampling. It leverages easily obtained geometry partition information to guide the feature learning process, resulting in a significant boost to the baseline models. Querying global features from geometric partitions enlarges the receptive fields in a data-dependent way, which helps to capture more expressive features. The geometric partitions also guide the downsampling procedure to drop redundant points while keeping unique points. We hope that this work will draw more attention to integrating geometric partition clues into point cloud understanding, as redundancy is a unique problem of point clouds compared to 2D images.
In the future, we plan to investigate integrating the proposed techniques into other 3D scene understanding tasks, such as object detection and instance segmentation, Additionally, we aim to test the proposed method on outdoor datasets, where long-term feature learning and point redundancy pose significant challenges.

 \caption{\textbf{The Paradigm of GeoSpark Architecture} Initially, the point input is fed into the "Geometric Partition \& Embedding" module to obtain geometric partitions and encode them into superpoints. These superpoints are then processed in the global branch to learn features at multiple scales before being added to the local branch as geometry guidance. In addition to the primary prediction loss, a superpoint loss is introduced to guide the training of the global branch. The aggregation module can be altered to various backbones.}

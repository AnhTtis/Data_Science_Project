    "abstract": "An edge coloring of a graph $G$ is \\emph{woody} if no cycle is monochromatic. The \\emph{arboricity} of a graph $G$, denoted by $\\arb (G)$, is the least number of colors needed for a woody coloring of $G$. A coloring of $G$ is \\emph{strongly woody} if after contraction of any single edge it is still woody. In other words, not only any cycle in $G$ can be monochromatic but also any \\emph{broken cycle}, i.e., a simple path arising by deleting a single edge from the cycle. The least number of colors in a strongly woody coloring of $G$ is denoted by $ζ(G)$ and called the \\emph{strong arboricity} of $G$.\n  We prove that $ζ(G)\\leqslant χ_a(G)$, where $χ_a(G)$ is the \\emph{acyclic chromatic number} of $G$ (the least number of colors in a proper vertex coloring without a $2$-colored cycle). In particular, we get that $ζ(G)\\leqslant 5$ for planar graphs and $ζ(G)\\leqslant 4$ for otuterplanar graphs. We conjecture that $ζ(G)\\leqslant 4$ holds for all planar graphs. We also prove that $ζ(G)\\leqslant 4(\\arb(G))^2$ holds for arbitrary graph $G$. A natural generalziation of strong arboricity to \\emph{matroids} is also discussed, with a special focus on cographic matroids.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we consider a sensor selection drawn at random by a sampling\nwith replacement policy for a linear time-invariant dynamical system subject to\nprocess and measurement noise. We employ the Kalman filter to estimate the\nstate of the system. However, the statistical properties of the filter are not\ndeterministic due to the stochastic selection of sensors. As a consequence, we\nderive concentration inequalities to bound the estimation error covariance of\nthe Kalman filter in the semi-definite sense. Concentration inequalities\nprovide a framework for deriving semi-definite bounds that hold in a\nprobabilistic sense. Our main contributions are three-fold. First, we develop\nalgorithmic tools to aid in the implementation of a matrix concentration\ninequality. Second, we derive concentration-based bounds for three types of\nstochastic selections. Third, we propose a polynomial-time procedure for\nfinding a sampling distribution that indirectly minimizes the maximum\neigenvalue of the estimation error covariance. Our proposed sampling policy is\nalso shown to empirically outperform three other sampling policies: uniform,\ndeterministic greedy, and randomized greedy.",

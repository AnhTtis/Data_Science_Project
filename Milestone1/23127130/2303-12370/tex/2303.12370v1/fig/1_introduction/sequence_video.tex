The samples come from CSV dataset. They describe two types of step schedule to accomplish the task of ”fix the test tube on the iron stand with iron clamp”. The upper process the step "fix on the iron stand " before the steps "take up the test tube" and "screw the iron clamp". Diversely, the lower make the steps of "take up the test tube" and "screw the iron clamp" before the step "fix on the iron stand ". It can be seen that the order, time span and temporal location of sub-actions to accomplish the task are apparently different.

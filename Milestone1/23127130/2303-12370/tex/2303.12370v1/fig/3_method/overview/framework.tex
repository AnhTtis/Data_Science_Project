\textbf{Overview of our framework.}
Our framework consists of three parts: vision representation module, language representation module, multiple granularity loss module. In the vision representation module, we feed the frames sampled from the untrimmed sequential video into the module, then obtain the frame representations and a video representation. In the language representation module, a collection of texts of procedures and the description of the entire video pass into the pre-trained language backbone separately, and we get the sentence representations and a paragraph representation. In addition, we introduce multiple granularity contrastive learning loss to restrict representations in cross-model space.

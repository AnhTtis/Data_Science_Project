\section{Conclusions}

The landscape of cloud security is changing with the growing desire to  
remove the cloud provider from the trust domain. 
%
%
Hardware vendors lay foundation for implementing this vision through a
collection of mechanisms that ensure confidentiality of a cloud execution,
i.e.,  encryption of VM memory, but, unfortunately, lack support for
ensuring runtime integrity. 
%
Our work develops a novel approach for virtualizing the hardware
root-of-trust through a combination of hardware mechanisms and a new
ephemeral approach to the management of the TPM state.
%
%
We demonstrate how an ephemeral \vtpm{} can be used for providing
remote attestation of a \cvm{}.
%
In the spirit of transparency, our implementation is in the open
source, and can be audited, verified, and extended.
%
As more and more cloud providers are gearing up for offering confidential
VMs, we believe our \svtpm{} architecture would provide a reference
point for implementing a \vtpm{} on \snp{} infrastructure.
%
While our implementation is tied to \snp{}, there is no real reason
why it could not be replicated in other TEEs. The only requirement is
to deploy ephemeral \vtpm{}s inside a secure enclave that is isolated
from both the rest of the hardware (i.e. encrypted) and from the guest
(the equivalent of what VMPLs provide).

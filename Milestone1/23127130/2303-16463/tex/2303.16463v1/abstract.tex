\section*{Abstract}

Departing from \textit{your data is safe with us} model where the cloud
infrastructure is trusted, cloud tenants are shifting towards a model 
in which the cloud provider is not part of the trust domain. 
%
Both silicon and cloud vendors are trying to address this shift by
introducing \textit{confidential computing} -- an umbrella term that
provides mechanisms for protecting the data in-use through encryption 
below the hardware boundary of the CPU, e.g., Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX), 
AMD secure encrypted virtualization (SEV), Intel trust domain extensions (TDX), etc.
%

In this work, we design and implement a virtual trusted platform
module (\vtpm{}) that virtualizes the hardware root-of-trust 
without requiring to trust the cloud provider. 
%
To ensure the security of a \vtpm{} in a provider-controlled environment,
we leverage unique isolation properties of the \snp{} hardware and a novel
approach to ephemeral TPM state management.  
%
%
Specifically, we develop a stateless \emph{ephemeral} \vtpm{} that supports 
remote attestation without persistent state. 
%
This allows us to pair each confidential VM with a private instance of a \vtpm{} that 
is completely isolated from the provider-controlled environment and other VMs. 
%
We built our prototype entirely on open-source components -- Qemu, Linux,
and Keylime.
%
Though our work is AMD-specific, a similar approach could be used to build
remote attestation protocol on other trusted execution environments~(TEE).

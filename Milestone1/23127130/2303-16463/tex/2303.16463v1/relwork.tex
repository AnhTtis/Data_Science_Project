\paragraph{Cloud \vtpm{}s}
Cloud providers offering \cvm{}s typically provide virtual TPM device that
would serve as a root-of-trust and could also be used for remote
attestation.
%
%
Google cloud only offers plain \sev{} \cvms{} and offers measured boot
attestation via a \vtpm{} managed by the
hypervisor~\cite{vtpm:gcp-shielded-vms}.
%
%
Microsoft Azure cloud relies on azure attestation service for attesting
\cvms{}~\cite{vtpm:azure} that generates a token to decrypt the \vtpm{}
state and the disk, hinting that 
%
Microsoft may have their custom firmware based on \svsm{}
specification~(i.e., inside \vmpl{0}) with a persistent \vtpm{} for attesting
\snp{} VMs.
%
Alibaba cloud offers \vtpm{} support on their elastic compute service
VMs~\cite{vtpm:alibaba}.
%
Amazon AWS provides Nitro TPM, a virtual TPM implementation conforming to
the TPM 2.0 specification as part of their EC2
offering~\cite{vtpm:aws-nitro}.
%
Some of these providers use a qemu-backed \vtpm{} that runs on the host,
which requires trusting the cloud provider.
%
Also, there is very limited public knowledge on how these cloud \vtpm{}s
are designed and the security guarantees of it.
%
In contrast, we plan to publish the source code of \svtpm{} implementation
that is built on top of other standard opensource components~(i.e., Qemu,
Linux, and Keylime).
%
As our \svtpm{} rely only on the hardware-protected isolation environment
offered by the AMD-SP hardware, by bringing their own \svsm{} firmware, a
user can completely eliminate the need for trusting the cloud provider.
%
\paragraph{TEE-based \vtpm{}s}
\cocotpm{} proposes a unified architecture for attestation of
\cvms{} where the hypervisor launches a \cvm{} that acts as a \vtpm{}
manager and handles all the \vtpm{} instances~\cite{cocotpm}.
They require TLS for securing the communication channel between a \cvm{}
and its \vtpm{}.
%
Though the \vtpm{} is running under a TEE, a central \vtpm{} manager
suffers from several attacks ranging from denial of service to colluding
with other \cvm{}s,
%
on the other hand launching a dedicated \cocotpm{} for every \cvm{} results
in wastage of architectural resources as the number of
address space identifiers~(ASIDs) are limited.
%

Several projects rely on running \vtpm{} under isolation provided by other
hardware TEE mechanisms such as Intel SGX~\cite{svtpm, eTPM,
vtpm-for-cloud} and ARM Trustzone~\cite{fTPM}.
%
SvTPM aims to protect against NVRAM replacement, and rollback
attacks~\cite{svtpm} by running the \vtpm{} inside an SGX enclave for
KVM-based VMs, whereas
%
eTPM manages several enclave \vtpm{}s in a Xen environment and relies on a
physical TPM to provide root-of-trust~\cite{eTPM}, similar to Berger et
al.~\cite{vtpm:berger}.
%
In contrast, our \svtpm{} architecture equips each \cvm{} with their own
private \vtpm{} instance by leveraging the \svsm{} architecture that
implements VM privilege levels.
%
Also, by implementing an ephemeral \vtpm{}, we completely eliminate the
classes of attacks that come with state protection.

\paragraph{Trusted execution environments}
Arm introduced confidential compute architecture~(CCA) with their Armv9-A
architecture where the processor provides an isolated hardware execution
environment called \emph{Realms}, for hosting entire VMs in a secure
space~\cite{wp:arm-cca}.
%
Similar to other TEEs~\cite{wp:amd-sev, spec:intel-tdx} they offer
pre-attestation of realms and can do measured boot with their hardware
enforced security~(HES) module specification~\cite{spec:arm-cca-sec-model}
which serves as the root-of-trust~\cite{arm-cca:rss, arm-cca:rss-talk}.

Intel, with their trust domain extensions~(TDX) introduced their own
version of hardware-isolated encrypted virtual machines called trusted
domains~(TDs).
%
Intel TDX relies on an SGX-based quoting enclave called the TD-quoting
enclave to perform remote attestation of trusted domains~\cite{spec:intel-tdx}.
%
However, SGX suffered from numerous vulnerabilities in the
past~\cite{sgx-attacks:survey} where researchers were able to extract the SGX
quoting enclave's attestation keys through micro-architectural side-channel
attacks to forge attestation reports~\cite{sgx-attack:foreshadow}.
%
The attestation keys used by these quoting enclave are long-lived, and when
leaked, affect millions of devices.
%
In our design, we do not have any secrets to guard as the attestation keys
are ephemeral.

\subsubsection{Different DLCLF, Different Controller}

This task will assume that \eqref{eq:switched_traj} is \iac{DTS} the controller has access to the switching sequence. Furthermore, the switching transitions of \eqref{eq:switched_traj} are described by a directed graph $\gs$ in which the vertices $\vs$ are the subsystems $1..N_s$. The edges $\es$ describe possible transitions: given a pair of systems $(i, j) \in (1..N_s)^2$, the edge $(i, j) \in \es$ if the switching sequence can obey $S(t)=i$ and $S(t+1)=j$. We note that self-loops are allowed in $\es$, and that discrete-time dwell-time constraints may be implemented by inflating the number of subsystems.

Each subsystem $s$ will possess \iac{DLCLF} with parameter $v_s > 0$ and a controller matrix $K_s$.
\begin{thm}
\Iac{DTS} \eqref{eq:switched_traj} that obeys the switching constraints $\gs$ is positive-stabilized by the switching-dependent feedback controller $u(t) = K_{S(t)} x(t)$ if there exists a tolerance $\eta > 0$,  vectors $v_s > 0$, matrices $X_s = \diag{v}$ and $Y_s \in \R^{m_s \times n}$  for all $s\in 1..N_s$ if for each arc $(i, j) \in \es$ the following equation holds,
\begin{align}
\label{eq:lyap_arc}
    v_i - (A_{j} X_j + B_j Y_j)\1_n - \eta\1_n \in \R_{\geq 0}^n.
\end{align}
The subsystem controller gains may be recovered $K_s = Y_s X_s^{-1}$ for each $s=1..N_s$.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
Let $V_s(x) = \max(x./v_s)$ be the \ac{DLCLF} for each subsystem $s\in1..N_s$. Equation \ref{eq:lyap_arc} represents the statement that
\begin{align}
        \forall (i,j) &\in \es: \qquad V_i(x) - V_j(x) > 0 
\end{align}

\end{proof}

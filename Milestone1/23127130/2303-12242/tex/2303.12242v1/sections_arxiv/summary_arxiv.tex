This paper has the following structure: 
Section \ref{sec:preliminaries} reviews the preliminaries of notation, positive systems, copositive Lyapunov functions, and the Extended Farkas Lemma.
Section \ref{sec:stab} presents \iac{LP} to perform data-driven stabilizing control of positive systems. Section \ref{sec:peaktopeak} extends this \ac{LP} framework to yield controllers that minimize the worst-case peak-to-peak gain between an external input and a controlled output. Section \ref{sec:switched} extends the \ac{LP} stabilization methods towards control of switched positive linear systems. Section \ref{sec:lpv} details how these approaches can be used for positive \ac{LPV} systems.
Section \ref{sec:examples} demonstrates effectiveness of these methods on stabilizing and worst-case-optimal control of example systems.
Section \ref{sec:conclusion} concludes the paper.

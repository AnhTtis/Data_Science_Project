The contributions of this work are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \Iac{LP} that performs data-driven positive-stabilizing control for all systems consistent with observed data.
    \item A tabulation of computational complexity required to solve this \ac{LP}.
    \item An extension of this \ac{LP} towards worst-case peak-to-peak gain minimizing control.
    \item An application of the \ac{LP} for positive switched and positive \ac{LPV} systems.
\end{itemize}

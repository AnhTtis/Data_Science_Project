\section{Conclusion}

\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper presented an LP-based algorithm (Theorem \ref{thm:poly_contain_lp}) to perform data-driven stabilizing control of positive linear systems. The state-feedback controller $K$ stabilizes all possible systems in the $L_\infty$-norm bounded consistency set $\Sigma_\dc$, as certified by a common \ac{DLCLF} function $V(x) = \max(x./v)$  and the Extended Farkas Lemma. There is no conservativeness in such a design: Equation \eqref{eq:lp_stab} will find a controller iff there exists such a linear copositive Lyapunov function across all consistent systems. This framework can also be used to perform data-driven worst-case peak-to-peak gain minimization using Equation \eqref{eq:p2p}.

Future work includes imposing forms of consistency sets for the noise (e.g. elementwise L2 norm bounds, semidefinite energy-based noise bounds for $\bw$). Other avenues include 
creating controllers in the switched or linear-parameter-varying setting, and extending this method towards Monotone systems. 

% An alternative  approach involves using polynomial-optimization hierarchies for copositive matrices by allowing for common quadratic copositive Lyapunov functions \cite{parrilo2000structured}.

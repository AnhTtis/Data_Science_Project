\begin{itemize}
    \item Switching (Same controller, subsystem controllers, LPV, choosing the switching sequence)
    \item Other noise models ($L_2$, Semidefinite/energy)
    \item Bounded input control, ROA
    \item EIV control for positive systems based on the methods of \cite{miller2022eiv_short, miller2022eivarx}
\end{itemize}

I have implemented same-controller, subsystem-controllers, and LPV of 1. I need to find a good working example of the Lyapunov-Metzler inequalities in discrete-time to choose the switching sequence.

I have a rough example for 2 (L2-bounded noise), which should be enough for the case study. This uses Yalmip's robust optimization module.

I don't yet have code for bounded-input control.

EIV for positive system should go in its own paper (ACC 2024?). Much of the math is the same ($n^2 + n$ Psatz constraints for a single system in state-space, $n_p + n_c + 2$ constraints for SISO control), but there are some additional considerations and linear constraints that may be added in when the underlying plant is Metzler/Nonnegative.

% \subsection{Other Noise Models}
% \urg{$L_2$ noise, Semidefinite/energy noise. We can use robust counterparts and everything will be non-conservative and tight.}
% \begin{rmk}
% \urg{we might not need to write the discrepency matrix}

% Other noise models include elementwise constraints on $\norm{w}_2^2$ or energy constraints such that $P - \bw \bw^T$ is positive semidefinite for some known positive definite $P$ matrix.

% \subsection{Switching}

% \urg{This could be in a separate journal paper. There is a large amount of material on copositive Lypapunov functions for  switching positive systems.

% We can talk about three basic models of switching:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Common Controller with different $(A, B)$
%     \item Individual-system controller and (possibly) Lyapunov Function with different $(A, B)$
%     \item LPVA (different $A$, same $B$) system: common Lypunov function with gain-scheduled controller.
% \end{itemize}

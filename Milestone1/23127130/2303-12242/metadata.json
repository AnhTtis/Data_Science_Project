    "abstract": "This paper presents a linear-programming based algorithm to perform data-driven stabilizing control of linear positive systems. A set of state-input-transition observations is collected up to magnitude-bounded noise. A state feedback controller and dual linear copositive Lyapunov function are created such that the set of all data-consistent plants is contained within the set of all stabilized systems. This containment is certified through the use of the Extended Farkas Lemma and solved via Linear Programming. Sign patterns and sparsity structure for the controller may be imposed using linear constraints. The complexity of this algorithm scales in a polynomial manner with the number of states and inputs. Effectiveness is demonstrated on example systems.",

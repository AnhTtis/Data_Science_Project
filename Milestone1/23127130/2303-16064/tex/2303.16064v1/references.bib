ABSTRACT = {Classical option pricing schemes assume that the value of a financial asset follows a geometric Brownian motion (GBM). However, a growing body of studies suggest that a simple GBM trajectory is not an adequate representation for asset dynamics, due to irregularities found when comparing its properties with empirical distributions. As a solution, we investigate a generalisation of GBM where the introduction of a memory kernel critically determines the behaviour of the stochastic process. We find the general expressions for the moments, log-moments, and the expectation of the periodic log returns, and then obtain the corresponding probability density functions using the subordination approach. Particularly, we consider subdiffusive GBM (sGBM), tempered sGBM, a mix of GBM and sGBM, and a mix of sGBMs. We utilise the resulting generalised GBM (gGBM) in order to examine the empirical performance of a selected group of kernels in the pricing of European call options. Our results indicate that the performance of a kernel ultimately depends on the maturity of the option and its moneyness.},

abstract = {We study the transport and mixing properties of flows in a variety of settings, connecting the classical geometrical approach via invariant manifolds with a probabilistic approach via transfer operators. For non-divergent fluid-like flows, we demonstrate that eigenvectors of numerical transfer operators efficiently decompose the domain into invariant regions. For dissipative chaotic flows such a decomposition into invariant regions does not exist; instead, the transfer operator approach detects almost-invariant sets. We demonstrate numerically that the boundaries of these almost-invariant regions are predominantly comprised of segments of co-dimension 1 invariant manifolds. For a mixing periodically driven fluid-like flow we show that while sets bounded by stable and unstable manifolds are almost-invariant, the transfer operator approach can identify almost-invariant sets with smaller mass leakage. Thus the transport mechanism of lobe dynamics need not correspond to minimal transport. The transfer operator approach is purely probabilistic; it directly determines those regions that minimally mix with their surroundings. The almost-invariant regions are identified via eigenvectors of a transfer operator and are ranked by the corresponding eigenvalues in the order of the sets’ invariance or “leakiness”. While we demonstrate that the almost-invariant sets are often bounded by segments of invariant manifolds, without such a ranking it is not at all clear which intersections of invariant manifolds form the major barriers to mixing. Furthermore, in some cases invariant manifolds do not bound sets of minimal leakage. Our transfer operator constructions are very simple and fast to implement; they require a sample of short trajectories, followed by eigenvector calculations of a sparse matrix.}

    abstract = { We investigate the linear programming framework for an exit-time stochastic control problem and apply the moment-sum-of-squares hierarchy to obtain tight pointwise bounds and global bounding functions for the value function. The primal linear program over suitable measures and the dual linear program over test functions are implemented numerically by semidefinite programs which target at moments and sum-of-squares polynomial representations, respectively. Numerically optimized bounds converge to the value function from below as polynomial degree increases to infinity under suitable technical conditions. We focus on the dual problem, which is particularly effective, as its single implementation yields a polynomial bounding function over the entire problem domain, and since it allows a flexible choice of objective function, one may improve the global bound on regions of interest. }

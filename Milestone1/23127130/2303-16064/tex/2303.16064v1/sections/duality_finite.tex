\section{Duality and Finite-Dimensional Programs}
\label{sec:duality}
% Compact restriction.

Statement of dual program in terms of an auxiliary function $v(t, x)$

\urg{Possibly put Finite-Dimensional on its own, or lump everything together. I'm not sure how the sectional breakdown will occur. We also have a choice of when to introduce concepts from the Moment-SOS hierarchy. }

% Presentation of Strong duality under the compact setting.

Moment-SOS program with strong duality.



% \urg{ We can't assume that $\mu_p^*$ at optimality will be a dirac delta.}

\section{Conclusion}

\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper considered the chance-peak problem, which involved finding upper bounds on the quantiles of state functions $p(x)$ achieved by \ac{SDE} systems. The true $(1-\epsilon)$-quantile statistic $P^*$ \eqref{eq:peak_chance} is upper-bounded by the Cantelli/VP approximation $P^*_r$ \eqref{eq:peak_chance_tail}, which in turn is upper bounded by an infinite-dimensional \ac{SOCP} $p^*_r$ \eqref{eq:var_meas_soc} and its moment-\ac{SOS} finite-dimensional \acp{SDP} yielding $p^*_{r,d}$ with $\lim_{d\rightarrow \infty} p^*_{r, d} = p^*_d$. Each of these upper-bounds contribute valuable information towards the analysis of \acp{SDE}.

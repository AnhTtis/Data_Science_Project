This paper puts forth the following contributions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Infinite-dimensional convex programs (tail-bound \acp{SOCP} and \ac{CVAR} \acp{LP}) to upper-bound the \ac{VAR} of a stochastic process
    \item Converging sequences of \acp{SDP} in increasing size (degree) that upper-bound the infinite-dimensional program using the moment-\ac{SOS} hierarchy
    \item Experiments that demonstrate the utility of these methods on polynomial stochastic systems
\end{itemize}

Distinctions as compared to prior work include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The chance-peak analysis problem maximizes the worst-case tail-bound/\ac{CVAR}, rather than minimizing worst-case upper-bounds on the \ac{VAR} (v.s. \cite{dupacova1987minimax, vcerbakova2006worst, shapiro2021lectures})
    \item Optimal stopping is performed with a tail-bound/\ac{CVAR} objective of $p$, rather than an expectation (mean) objective (v.s. \cite{cho2002linear, kashima2010optimization})
\end{itemize}

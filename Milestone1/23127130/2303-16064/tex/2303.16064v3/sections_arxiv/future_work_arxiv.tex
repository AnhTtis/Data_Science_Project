\old{Future work includes finding conditions under which the measure-based upper-bounding does not add conservatism (e.g., cases where $p^*_r = P^*_r$), and utilizing higher-moment tail-probability inequalities to obtain closer estimates to the \ac{VAR} \cite{he2010bounding}. Another avenue involves developing stochastic optimal control strategies to minimize quantile statistics. Other aspects could include extension of Switching methods towards more general \levy processes \cite{applebaum2004levy, kashima2010optimization}.}

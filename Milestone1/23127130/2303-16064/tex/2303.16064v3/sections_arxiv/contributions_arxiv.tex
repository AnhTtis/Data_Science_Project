This paper puts forth the following contributions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Infinite-dimensional convex programs (Minimax \ac{SOCP} and \ac{CVAR} \ac{LP}) to upper-bound the \ac{VAR} of a stochastic process
    \item Converging sequences of \acp{SDP} in increasing size (degree) that upper-bound the infinite-dimensional program using the moment-\ac{SOS} hierarchy
    \item Experiments that demonstrate the utility of these methods on polynomial stochastic systems
    \item Proofs of strong duality and of no-relaxation-gap (between measure programs and \ac{SDE} truth)
\end{itemize}

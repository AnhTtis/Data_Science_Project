\section{Conclusion}

\label{sec:conclusion}


This paper considered the problem of finding the maximizing $\ac{VAR}$ of a state function $p(x)$ along trajectories of \ac{SDE} systems. Two upper-bounding methods were used to approximate this maximum \ac{VAR}: tail-bounds and \ac{CVAR}. The tail-bounds are used to formulate an \ac{SOCP} in measures \eqref{eq:var_meas_soc}, while \ac{CVAR} produces an \ac{LP} in measures \eqref{eq:peak_cvar_meas}. Each of these convex programs in measures are approximated by the moment-\ac{SOS} hierarchy of \acp{SDP} in a convergent manner if the problem data (dynamics, support sets) is polynomial.

Future work avenue involves reducing the conservatism of chance-peak based distance estimation, developing stochastic optimal control strategies to minimize quantile statistics, and applying chance-peak techniques towards analysis of hybrid systems.

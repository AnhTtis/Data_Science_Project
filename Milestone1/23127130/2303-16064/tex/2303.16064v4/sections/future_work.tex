Future work includes finding conditions under which the measure-based upper-bounding does not add conservatism (e.g. cases where $p^*_r = P^*_r$), and utilizing higher-moment tail-probability inequalities to obtain closer estimates to the \ac{VAR} \cite{he2010bounding}. Other work involves studying the duality structure of \eqref{eq:var_meas_soc} with respect to the achievement of strong duality. The techniques introduced in this paper can also be extended to application domains such as distance estimation \cite{miller2022distance_short}, 
\levy processes \cite{kashima2010optimization}, and exit-time statistics \cite{henrion2021moment}. Another avenue involves developing stochastic optimal control strategies to minimize quantile statistics.

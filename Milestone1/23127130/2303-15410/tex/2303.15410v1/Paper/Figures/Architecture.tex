\caption{
The proposed model architecture and training strategy. 
Both of teacher (\textit{bottom}) and student (\textit{top}) are trained by the same pose estimation loss, and student takes additional supervision from teacher through LUPI.
The loss for LUPI is applied to the feature maps of the first convolutional layer (\ie, C1) and the following four residual blocks (\ie, R1--R4) of a ResNet backbone.
Teacher and student share all the parameters except LSBNs.
Details of the pose estimation module are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:pose_architecture} of the supplementary material.

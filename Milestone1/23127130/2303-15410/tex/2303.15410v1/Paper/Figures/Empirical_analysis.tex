      Quantitative analysis on (a) style gaps and (b) feature gaps measured by the average Hausdorff distance~\cite{dubuisson1994modified} between low-light and well-lit conditions.
      The gaps are measured on each level of the four residual blocks (\ie, R1-R4) of the ResNet backbone while considering each lighting condition as a set of styles of associated images in (a) and their features in (b).

\section{Conclusion}

We have introduced the first attempt to estimate human poses in extremely low-light images. 
To this end, we have first presented the ExLPose dataset that provides paired low-light and well-lit images with accurate human pose labels.
The novel model and training strategy also have been proposed for learning representations insensitive to lighting conditions using the paired well-lit images as privileged information.
Our method has been evaluated on real images taken under various low-light conditions, where it clearly outperforms domain adaptation and image enhancement methods.

\caption{The overall architecture of the person detection network and training strategy.
Both of teacher (\textit{bottom}) and student (\textit{top}) are trained by the same detection loss functions ($\mathcal{L}_{\textrm{cls}}$ and $\mathcal{L}_{\textrm{reg}}$), and student takes additional supervision from teacher through LUPI. 
The loss for LUPI is applied to the feature maps of the first convolutional layer (\ie, C1) and the following feature pyramid network (FPN) which takes feature maps of four residual blocks (\ie, R1-R4) of a ResNet backbone as inputs. 
Teacher and student share all the parameters except LSBNs. 
``Head'', ``C'', and ``B'' denote roi head, object classification, and bounding box, respectively.

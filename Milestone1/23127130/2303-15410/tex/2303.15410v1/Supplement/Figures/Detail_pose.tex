\caption{Illustration of the detailed human pose estimation network architecture. Both of teacher (\textit{bottom}) and student (\textit{top}) are trained by the same pose estimation loss of $\mathcal{L}_{\textrm{global}}$ and $\mathcal{L}_{\textrm{refine}}$ from GlobalNet and RefineNet of CPN~\cite{chen2018cascaded}.
LUPI is applied to the feature maps of the first convolutional layer (\ie, C1) and four residual blocks (\ie, R1-R4) of a ResNet backbone.
Teacher and student share all the parameters except LSBNs.

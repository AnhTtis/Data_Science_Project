\caption{
$t$-SNE visualization of the distributions of Gram matrices computed from low-light and well-lit images.
The Gram matrices are computed from feature maps of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Res Blocks of ResNet-50~\cite{resnet} pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset~\cite{Imagenet}.
In all the visualizations, images of the same lighting condition are clustered together, suggesting that neural styles in the form of Gram matrices encode lighting conditions.

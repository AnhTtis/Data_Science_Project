    In this document, we include supplementary materials for ``Dual-path Adaptation from Image to Video Transformers''.
    We first provide more concrete implementation details (\secref{sec:imple_detail}), and additional experimental results (\secref{sec:swin}), including the results using a different backbone and ablation study for the resolution of the grid-like frameset.
    Finally, we visualize more attention maps from each path to complement the effectiveness of the proposed method (\secref{sec:qual}).

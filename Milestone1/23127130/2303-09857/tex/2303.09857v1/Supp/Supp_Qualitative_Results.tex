\section{More Attention Visualization of \method}\label{sec:qual}
    The additional attention visualization is illustrated in \figref{fig:qual_supp}.
    We depict the attention maps of $\spcls$ and $\tpcls$ from the final transformer block of each path.
    All videos are sampled from the SSv2~\cite{ssv2} dataset and ViT-B/16 is used as the backbone.
    While we use 8 frames in the spatial path, the attention maps corresponding to only 4 frames are displayed for visibility.
    Interestingly, the results show that the model trained with \method is capable of focusing on dynamic action-related regions in both adaptation paths.
    As exemplified in \figref{fig:quala-supp} and \figref{fig:qualc-supp}, $\spcls$ of the spatial path tends to focus on action-related objects, and $\tpcls$ of the temporal path concentrates on action-related movements.
    Therefore, the two paths complement each other, leading to spatiotemporal modeling.

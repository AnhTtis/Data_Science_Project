    "abstract": "Reduction of high-loop Feynman integrals is one of the main tasks in scatting amplitude. In this paper, a new representation of Feynman integrals proposed by Chen in [1,2] is considered. We combined Chen's method with \"syzygy\" trick to simplify the IBP relations, and successfully canceled the dimensional shift and the unwanted doubled propagators. Moreover, we improved the method to deal with tensor's structure. We demonstrated our method using three two-loop integrals to show our method, and presented the analytical reduction coefficients in the top-sector.",

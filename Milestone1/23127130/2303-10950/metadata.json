    "abstract": "We analyze the preservation properties of a family of reversible splitting methods when they are applied to the numerical time integration of linear differential equations defined in the unitary group. The schemes involve complex coefficients and are conjugated to unitary transformations for sufficiently small values of the time step-size. New and efficient methods up to order six are constructed and tested on the linear Schrödinger equation.",

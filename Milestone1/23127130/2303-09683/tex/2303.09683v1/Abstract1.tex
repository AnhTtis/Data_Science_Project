\indent A new three dimensional approach to the chaos game
representation of protein sequences is explored in this thesis.
The basics of DNA, the synthesis of proteins from DNA, protein
structure and functionality and sequence alignment techniques are
presented. The mathematical background needed for understanding
the chaos game representation and fractal analysis are briefly
discussed.
\paragraph
\indent An account of the existing literature on the chaos game
representation of DNA sequences and a detailed account of the
chaos game representation of protein sequences in two dimensions
with its advantages and limitations are presented. We explore a
new three dimensional approach to the chaos game representation of
protein sequences (3D-CGR) and study its ability \textit{a)} to
determine protein sequence similarity and differences, \textit{b)}
to study the  effect of dinucleotide biases at amino acid level on
the 3D-CGR derived protein homology, and \textit{c)} to identify
sequence similarity based on shuffled motifs that could be used
for studying protein evolution due to exon shuffling.

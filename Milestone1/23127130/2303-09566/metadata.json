    "abstract": "Non-topological solitons are localized classical field configurations stabilized by a Noether charge. Friedberg, Lee, and Sirlin proposed a simple renormalizable soliton model in their seminal 1976 paper, consisting of a complex scalar field that carries the Noether charge and a real-scalar mediator. We revisit this model, point out commonalities and differences with Q-ball solitons, and provide analytic approximations to the underlying differential equations.",

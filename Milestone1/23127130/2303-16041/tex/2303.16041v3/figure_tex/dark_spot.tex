\caption{A comparison of optical phase conjugation (OPC) performed with only the first phase plane: (a) Focusing efficiencies achieved at different points across the output facet of the multi-mode fiber using the phase-stepping (PS) and multi-plane neural network (MPNN) techniques. Output points with low focusing efficiency due to the inherent dark-spot problem can be seen in the PS method (see text for more details). In contrast, focusing efficiencies obtained with the MPNN method show more uniformity across the fiber facet. \AddB{ Log-scale images of light focused using the first SLM with a TM obtained by the (b) PS and (c) MPNN techniques. (d)} A histogram comparing the PS and MPNN methods shows that the PS technique leads to some output points with very low focusing efficiencies, while those obtained with MPNN method are more uniform and significantly higher. Note: Only the points within first 80\% diameter of the core from the center of the core are taken for the purpose of this histogram.}

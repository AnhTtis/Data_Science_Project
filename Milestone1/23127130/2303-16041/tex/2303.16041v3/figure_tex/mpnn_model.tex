\caption{Schematic of an $n$-layered optical network: a cascade of $n$ complex media denoted by their optical transmission matrices $T_k$ are separated by reconfigurable phase-shifter planes $x_k$, followed by detection optics $F$. This optical network can be represented as a multi-plane neural network (MPNN) with $n+1$ input layers of $x_k$, $n$ ``hidden-layers'' for $T_k$, and a known layer for $F$ with a $|.|^2$ activation.}

\caption{Noise-robustness of MPNN: A simulated $800 \times 800$- dimensional TM is recovered using the (a) phase-stepping (PS) and (b) multi-plane neural network (MPNN) techniques for different additive gaussian noise levels. The fidelity of the recovered TM is plotted as a function of the number of measurements per input mode ($\alpha$). While the PS technique quickly degrades in the presence of noise, the MPNN technique is able to reach high fidelities with small increases in the number of measurements.}

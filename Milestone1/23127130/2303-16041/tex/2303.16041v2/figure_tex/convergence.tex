\caption{Number of measurements required for optimal transmission matrix measurement: Experimental focusing efficiency achieved with (a) the first phase plane, (b) the second phase plane, and (c) both planes simultaneously, using a TM reconstructed with the phase-stepping technique and the multi-plane neural network (MPNN) plotted as a function of the number of measurements per input mode ($\alpha$). While phase-stepping converges to a maximum faster, the MPNN technique shows a much higher focusing efficiency.}

\caption{Learning multiple transmission matrices with an MPNN: (a) A cascade of multiple complex media interspersed by programmable phase planes can be characterised through the use of the MPNN technique. The recovered TMs corresponding to these media allows us to control the propagation of light at intermediate phase planes. (b) Numerical simulation showing three $16 \times 16$-dimensional TMs reconstructed with the MPNN technique, which are then used to focus light at each intermediate plane (insets). (c) Optimisation loss using the training and testing datasets for the three-plane MPNN.}

\caption{Learning the coherent transmission matrix of a multi-mode fiber: Test and train (a) loss and (b) mean-absolute percentage error (MAPE) as learning proceeds in epochs. A visual plot of the learnt transmission matrix in the (c) macro-pixel and (d) Laguerre-Gauss (LG) basis, where modes are segregated into respective mode groups. In order to change the basis of the TM from (c) to (d), a transformation matrix $B_{\textrm{Pix} \rightarrow \textrm{LG}}$ is constructed that maps the set of macro-pixel modes to a set of LG modes. The TM in the LG basis is calculated as $T_{\textrm{LG}} = B_{\textrm{Pix} \rightarrow \textrm{LG}}^\dagger T_{\textrm{Pix}} B_{\textrm{Pix} \rightarrow \textrm{LG}}$.}

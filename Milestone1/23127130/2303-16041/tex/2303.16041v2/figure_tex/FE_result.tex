\caption{(a-c) A comparison of optical phase conjugation (OPC) performed with only the second phase plane. Log-scale images of light focused using only $\textrm{SLM}_{2}$ with a TM obtained by the (a) phase-stepping and (b) multi-plane neural network techniques. (c) A histogram comparing second-plane focusing efficiencies of 50 random input modes achieved with the PS and MPNN techniques shows a marked improvement with the latter. (d-f) A comparison of OPC performed with both phase planes. Log-scale images of light focused using both SLMs with a TM obtained by the (d) PS and (e) MPNN techniques. (f) A histogram comparing focusing efficiencies for all output modes achieved with both planes shows a significant improvement with MPNN over the PS technique. The focusing efficiencies are corrected for SLM$_2$ basis-dependent loss for both methods.}

\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we study the unique problem of intermittently powered systems, where the system fails to observe or sense the target event due to insufficient energy to turn on. We take a unique approach to the problem by considering a swarm of intermittent nodes as an entity that amalgamates to address this non-observability problem. However, the high communication cost hinders this collaborative behavior by imposing no communication rules for efficiency. Therefore, we propose \Sys, where a group of intermittent nodes independently wakes up and sleeps to increase their collaborative capture and process success rate while minimizing the redundant active time by keeping at least one node active most of the time. On average, it captures and processes 58.50\% more events successfully than a single intermittent node and has a 54.40\% more capture and process success rate than a non-amalgamated swarm of intermittent nodes.

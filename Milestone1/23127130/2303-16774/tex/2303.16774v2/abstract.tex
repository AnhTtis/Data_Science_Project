Polarization is a common feature of social systems. Structural Balance Theory studies polarization of positive in-group and negative out-group ties in terms of semicycles in signed networks. However, enumerating semicycles is computationally expensive, so approximations are often needed to assess balance.
Here we introduce Multiscale Semiwalk Balance (MSB) approach 
for quantifying the degree of balance (DoB) in (un)directed, (un)weighted signed networks by approximating semicycles with closed semiwalks. MSB allows principled selection of a range of cycle lengths appropriate for assessing DoB and interpretable under the Locality Principle (which posits that patterns in shorter cycles are crucial for balance).
This calibration overcomes several limitations affecting walk-based approximations and enables efficient, interpretable methods for measuring DoB and clustering signed networks.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to real-world social systems. 
For instance, our methods can be used to provide strong evidence for increasing polarization in the U.S. Congress.

The question we ask in this paper is the following: is it possible to achieve a form of agreement also in presence of antagonistic interactions, modeled as negative weights on the communication graph? The answer to this question is affirmative: on signed networks all agents can converge to a consensus value which is the same for all agents except for the sign. Necessary and sufficient conditions are obtained to describe cases in which this is possible. These conditions have strong analogies with the theory of monotone systems. Linear and nonlinear Laplacian feedback designs are proposed.},

To demonstrate the approach's utility, we apply it to identify coalitions in US Congress since 1979 and examine the impact of polarized coalitions on the effectiveness of passing bills. Our models produce a globally optimal solution to the NP-hard problem of minimizing the total number of intra-group negative and inter-group positive edges. We tackle the intensive computations of dense signed networks by providing upper and lower bounds, then solving an optimization model which closes the gap between the two bounds and returns the optimal partitioning of vertices. Our substantive findings suggest that the dominance of an ideologically homogeneous coalition (i.e. partisan polarization) can be a protective factor that enhances legislative effectiveness.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Balance theory explains how network structural configurations relate to tension in social systems, which are commonly modeled as static undirected signed graphs. We expand this modeling approach by incorporating directionality of edges and considering three levels of analysis for balance assessment: triads, subgroups, and the whole network. For triad-level balance, we develop a new measure by utilizing semicycles that satisfy the condition of transitivity. For subgroup-level balance, we propose measures of cohesiveness (intra-group solidarity) and divisiveness (inter-group antagonism) to capture balance within and among subgroups. For network-level balance, we re-purpose the normalized line index to incorporate directionality and assess balance based on the proportion of edges whose position suits balance. Through comprehensive computational analyses, we quantify, analyze, and compare patterns of social structure in triads, subgroups, and the whole network across a range of social settings. We then apply our multilevel framework to examine balance in temporal and multilayer networks to demonstrates the generalizability of our approach. In most cases, we find relatively high balance across the three levels; providing another confirmation of balance theory. We also deliver empirical evidence for the argument that balance at different levels is not the same social phenomenon measured at different scales, but represents different properties (triadic balance, internal cohesion and external division of subgroups, and overall network polarization), and should therefore be evaluated independently from one another. We propose a comprehensive yet parsimonious approach to address this need.},

Through magnetic resonance imaging, this non-invasive technique is able to infer a snapshot of the cortical network within the living human brain. Here, we report on the initial success of a new weighted network communicability measure in distinguishing local and global differences between diseased patients and controls. This approach builds on recent advances in network science, where an underlying connectivity structure is used as a means to measure the ease with which information can flow between nodes. One advantage of our method is that it deals directly with the real-valued connectivity data, thereby avoiding the need to discretize the corresponding adjacency matrix, i.e. to round weights up to 1 or down to 0, depending upon some threshold value. Experimental results indicate that the new approach is able to extract biologically relevant features that are not immediately apparent from the raw connectivity data.},

Literary quality is not just hidden within a text; critics and other members of the literary field assign quality to texts. Previous judgements on the text, its author or on previous titles by the author, influence the evaluation of a text. Literary criticism is supposed to be orchestrated. In this article, orchestration of literary criticism is studied from the perspective of socialpsychological balance theory. Balance theory states that people tend to adjust their affections to affections expressed by or attributed to other people. As a result, affective relations display predictable patterns which reflect group structure. Network analysis identifies these patterns and can be used to investigate group structure.},

This condition emerges when a given nation belongs to a bloc of allies that only have enmities with a different confronted bloc. However, we find that large blocs of allies percolated by a tiny clique of mutual enemies, which are ubiquitous across history, are very unstable in terms of their balanced condition. We design a quantitative history approach to identify the nations playing a fundamental role in major events in human history over a period of almost 200 years. It is combined with historic narrative and the sociopolitical theory of ``balance of power'' to build up a new mixed approach to history based on network theory.},

  abstract = {The classic formulation of structural balance by Cartwright and Harary (Psychological Review, 63, 1956, 277-293) had the basic structural theorem that a balanced structure could be partitioned into two mutually antagonistic subgroups each having internal solidarity. Davis (Human Relations, 20, 1967, 181-187) extended this theorem for cases where there can be more than two such mutually antagonistic subgroups. We use these theorems to construct a criterion function for a local optimization partitioning procedure for signed digraphs. For any signed digraph, this procedure yields those partitions with the smallest number of errors, a measure of the imbalance in the graph, and an identification of those links inconsistent with both generalized and structural balance. These methods are applied to some artificial data and to the affect data from Sampson (A novitiate in a period of change: An experimental and case study of social relationships, Dissertation, Cornell University, 1968). The latter provides a positive test of a basic tenet of balance theory, that there is a tendency towards balance with signed relations in human groups. While these methods can be applied to all signed digraphs and signed graphs, the balance hypothesis is relevant only for affect ties.},

  abstract = {A fundamental problem in the study of complex networks is to provide quantitative measures of correlation and information flow between different parts of a system. To this end, several notions of communicability have been introduced and applied to a wide variety of real-world networks in recent years. Several such communicability functions are reviewed in this paper. It is emphasized that communication and correlation in networks can take place through many more routes than the shortest paths, a fact that may not have been sufficiently appreciated in previously proposed correlation measures. In contrast to these, the communicability measures reviewed in this paper are defined by taking into account all possible routes between two nodes, assigning smaller weights to longer ones. This point of view naturally leads to the definition of communicability in terms of matrix functions, such as the exponential, resolvent, and hyperbolic functions, in which the matrix argument is either the adjacency matrix or the graph Laplacian associated with the network.},

  abstract = {Signed social networks account for the situation in which friendship, trust, alliance \textendash represented by positive edges \textendash{} coexist with relations of dislike, distrust, conflict \textemdash{} represented by negative edges. According to Heider's hypothesis of balance certain combinations of positive and negative edges in a network confer stabilitybalance-to the networks, while others \textendash{} imbalanced networks \textendash{} are unstable and tend towards balance. Here, we review the concept of structural balance starting from ``first principles'' based on the original formulation of Heider. Based on Harary's ``tendency towards completeness'' hypothesis we formulate that a network is balanced if it can give rise to a balanced complete signed graph. We then propose an algorithm for edge completion of networks and prove several results concerning the balance of cycles, and graphs. We then consider balance as a dynamic process in which the entities of the system try to make agreements by pairs to reach consensus or ``agreed upon dissensus''. At this point we arrive at a few general conditions that any index quantifying the degree of balance \textendash{} or degree of imbalance \textendash{} has to have. We then analyze a degree of balance index proposed by Estrada and Benzi (2014) and show that it fulfills all these requirements. In contrast, we show how some other approaches to quantify the degree of balance are incomplete and we provide examples of the difficulties found with their use. Using all these developed conceptions about the level of balance in signed social networks we proceed to the study of the international relation among countries in the world for the period 1938\textendash 2008. We conclude that the system of international relations is highly imbalanced for the whole period with no trend to increasing balance with the passage of time. Finally, we consider the use of degree of balance indices relative to null models and clarify that they do not account for the degree of balance of a signed network but for the ``effort'' needed to create such degree of balance among a large set of randomly shuffled networks.},

After the transition, the stocks of companies in these groups become all negatively correlated between them and with most of the rest of the stocks in the market. The implied change in the network topology is directly related to a decrease in stock predictability, a finding with novel important implications for asset allocation and portfolio hedging strategies.},

In this expression, |S | is the number of (weakly) connected induced subgraphs of G on at most vertices, is the maximum degree of any vertex and {$\omega$} is the exponent of matrix multiplication. We compare the algorithm complexity both theoretically and experimentally with most of the existing algorithms for the same task. These comparisons show that the algorithm described here is the best general purpose algorithm for the class of graphs where ( {$\omega-$}1 -1 + 1)|S | {$\leq$} |Cycle |, with |Cycle | the total number of simple cycles of length at most , including backtracks and self-loops. On Erdo\H{}s\textendash R\'enyi random graphs, we find empirically that this happens when the edge probability is larger than circa 4/N . In addition, we show that some real-world networks also belong to this class. Finally, the algorithm permits the enumeration of simple cycles and simple paths on networks where vertices are labeled from an alphabet on n letters with an asymptotic running time of O N + M + n {$\omega$} + |S | . A Matlab implementation of the algorithm proposed here is available for download.},

We can investigate this question only if we can quantify polarization, by taking into account how extreme the opinions of the people are, how much they organize into echo chambers, and how these echo chambers organize in the network. Current polarization estimates are insensitive to at least one of these factors: They cannot conclusively clarify the opening question. Here, we propose a measure of ideological polarization that can capture the factors we listed. The measure is based on the generalized Euclidean distance, which estimates the distance between two vectors on a network, e.g., representing people's opinion. This measure can fill the methodological gap left by the state of the art and leads to useful insights when applied to real-world debates happening on social media and to data from the U.S. Congress.           ,              A previously unknown measure for estimating ideological divergence in social networks is used to study polarization.},

  abstract = {Heavy-tailed networks, which have degree distributions characterised by slower than exponentially bounded tails, are common in many different situations. Some interesting cases, where heavy tails are characterised by inverse powers {$\lambda$} in the range 1 {$<$} {$\lambda$} {$<$} 2, arise for associative knowledge networks, and semantic and linguistic networks. In these cases, the differences between the networks are often delicate, calling for robust methods to characterise the differences. Here, we introduce a method for comparing networks using a density matrix based on q-generalised adjacency matrix kernels. It is shown that comparison of networks can then be performed using the q-generalised Kullback\textendash Leibler divergence. In addition, the q-generalised divergence can be interpreted as a q-generalised free energy, which enables the thermodynamic-like macroscopic description of the heavy-tailed networks. The viability of the q-generalised adjacency kernels and the thermodynamic-like description in characterisation of complex networks is demonstrated using a simulated set of networks, which are modular and heavy-tailed with a degree distribution of inverse power law in the range 1 {$<$} {$\lambda$} {$<$} 2.},

WSNs can capture like/dislike, trust/distrust, and other social relationships between people. In this paper, we consider the problem of predicting the weights of edges in such networks. We propose two novel measures of node behavior: the goodness of a node intuitively captures how much this node is liked/trusted by other nodes, while the fairness of a node captures how fair the node is in rating other nodes' likeability or trust level. We provide axioms that these two notions need to satisfy and show that past work does not meet these requirements for WSNs. We provide a mutually recursive definition of these two concepts and prove that they converge to a unique solution in linear time. We use the two measures to predict the edge weight in WSNs. Furthermore, we show that when compared against several individual algorithms from both the signed and unsigned social network literature, our fairness and goodness metrics almost always have the best predictive power. We then use these as features in different multiple regression models and show that we can predict edge weights on 2 Bitcoin WSNs, an Epinions WSN, 2 WSNs derived from Wikipedia, and a WSN derived from Twitter with more accurate results than past work. Moreover, fairness and goodness metrics form the most significant feature for prediction in most (but not all) cases.},

Certain social networks contain, in addition to the usual friend links, enemy links. These networks are called signed social networks. A classical and major concept for signed social networks is that of structural balance, i.e., the tendency of triangles to be balanced towards including an even number of negative edges, such as friend-friend-friend and friend-enemy-enemy triangles. In this article, we introduce several new signed network analysis methods that exploit structural balance for measuring partial balance, for finding communities of people based on balance, for drawing signed social networks, and for solving the problem of link prediction. Notably, the introduced methods are based on the signed graph Laplacian and on the concept of signed resistance distances. We evaluate our methods on a collection of four signed social network datasets.},

Here we situate company-level production networks within a wider space of networks that are different in nature, but similar in local connectivity structure. Through this lens, we study a regional and a national network of inferred trade relationships reconstructed from Dutch national economic statistics and re-interpret prior empirical findings. We find that company-level production networks have so-called functional structure, as previously identified in protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. Functional networks are distinctive in their over-representation of closed squares, which we quantify using an existing measure called spectral bipartivity. Shared local connectivity structure lets us ferry insights between domains. PPI networks are shaped by complementarity, rather than homophily, and we use multi-layer directed configuration models to show that this principle explains the emergence of functional structure in production networks. Companies are especially similar to their close competitors, not to their trading partners. Our findings have practical implications for the analysis of production networks and give us precise terms for the local structural features that may be key to understanding their routine function, failure, and growth.},

Weak polarization occurs when relations between the polarized groups are merely absent, while strong polarization occurs when the relations between the polarized groups are negative. I apply the Stochastic Degree Sequence Model to data on bill cosponsorship in both the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate, from 1973 (93rd session) to 2016 (114th session) to infer a series of signed networks of political relationships among legislators, which I then use to answer two research questions. First, can the widely reported finding of increasing weak polarization in the U.S. Congress be replicated when using a statistical model to make inferences about when positive political relations exist? Second, is the (increasing) polarization observed in the U.S. Congress only weak polarization, or is it strong polarization? I find that both chambers exhibit both weak and strong polarization, that both forms are increasing, and that they are structured by political party affiliation. However, I also find these trends are unrelated to which party holds the majority in a chamber.},

It is also shown that a multiplex signed network is structurally balanced if and only if its related compressed network is structurally balanced. Built on the proposed theoretical results and dynamic mode decomposition technique, a distributed data-driven approach is proposed for verification of the structural balance of large-scale multiplex signed networks without relying on the explicit knowledge on network topology.},

  abstract = {Though research on the Semantic Web has progressed at a steady pace, its promise has yet to be realized. One major difficulty is that, by its very nature, the Semantic Web is a large, uncensored system to which anyone may contribute. This raises the question of how much credence to give each source. We cannot expect each user to know the trustworthiness of each source, nor would we want to assign top-down or global credibility values due to the subjective nature of trust. We tackle this problem by employing a web of trust, in which each user maintains trusts in a small number of other users. We then compose these trusts into trust values for all other users. The result of our computation is not an agglomerate ``trustworthiness" of each user. Instead, each user receives a personalized set of trusts, which may vary widely from person to person. We define properties for combination functions which merge such trusts, and define a class of functions for which merging may be done locally while maintaining these properties. We give examples of specific functions and apply them to data from Epinions and our BibServ bibliography server. Experiments confirm that the methods are robust to noise, and do not put unreasonable expectations on users. We hope that these methods will help move the Semantic Web closer to fulfilling its promise.},

Until now, polarization research has focused on opinion extremeness, overlooking the correlation between di erent policy issues. In this paper, we explain the emergence of hyperpolarization, i.e., the combination of extremeness and correlation between issues, by developing a new theory of opinion formation called ``Weighted Balance Theory (WBT)''. WBT extends Heider's cognitive balance theory to encompass multiple weighted attitudes. We validated WBT on empirical data from the National Election Survey. Furthermore, we developed an opinion dynamics model based on WBT, which, for the first time, is able to generate hyperpolarization and to explain the link between a ective and opinion polarization. Finally, our theory encompasses other phenomena of opinion dynamics, including mono-polarization and backfire e ects.},

A novel approach is proposed to analyze the structural balance of a general network based on the strongly connected components of the topology graph and the Frobenius normal form of the adjacency matrix. To address the distributed control of high-order signed networks, both statefeedback and observer-type algorithms are developed on the basis of low-gain strategies, where a unified framework is presented to construct full- or reduced-order observers. The dynamical behaviors of the signed network under the proposed algorithms are systematically explored, where the nontrivial final network state is computed by employing an eigenvector-based approach. The theoretical results are illustrated by numerical examples.},

However, empirical studies to date mostly focus on the analysis of stable relations. This article introduces Dynamic Network Actor Models (DyNAMs) for the study of directed, interpersonal interaction through time. The presented model addresses three important aspects of interpersonal interaction. First, interactions unfold in a larger social context and depend on complex structures in social systems. Second, interactions emanate from individuals and are based on personal preferences, restricted by the available interaction opportunities. Third, sequences of interactions develop dynamically, and the timing of interactions relative to one another contains useful information. We refer to these aspects as the network nature, the actor-oriented nature, and the dynamic nature of social interaction. A case study compares the DyNAM framework to the relational event model, a widely used statistical method for the study of social interaction data.},

On the other hand homophily, defined as the propensity of similar agents to connect to each other, is one of the most fundamental social processes observed in many human and animal societies. In this paper we examine the extent to which homophily is su icient to produce the typical structural properties of social networks. To do so, we conduct a simulation study based on the Social Distance Attachment (SDA) model, a particular kind of Random Geometric Graph (RGG), in which nodes are embedded in a social space and connection probabilities depend functionally on distances between nodes. We derive the form of the model from first principles based on existing analytical results and argue that the mathematical construction of RGGs corresponds directly to the homophily principle, so they provide a good model for it. We find that homophily, especially when combined with a random edge rewiring, is su icient to reproduce many of the characteristic features of social networks. Additionally, we devise a hybrid model combining SDA with the configuration model that allows generating homophilic networks with arbitrary degree sequences and we use it to study interactions of homophily with processes imposing constraints on degree distributions. We show that the e ects of homophily on clustering are robust with respect to distribution constraints, while degree assortativity can be highly dependent on the particular kind of enforced degree sequence.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The principle of similarity, or homophily, is often used to explain patterns observed in complex networks such as transitivity and the abundance of triangles (3-cycles). However, many phenomena from division of labor to protein-protein interactions (PPI) are driven by complementarity (differences and synergy). Here we show that the principle of complementarity is linked to the abundance of quadrangles (4-cycles) and dense bipartite-like subgraphs. We link both principles to their characteristic motifs and introduce two families of coefficients of: (1)~structural similarity, which generalize local clustering and closure coefficients and capture the full spectrum of similarity-driven structures; (2)~structural complementarity, defined analogously but based on quadrangles instead of triangles. Using multiple social and biological networks, we demonstrate that the coefficients capture structural properties related to meaningful domain-specific phenomena. We show that they allow distinguishing between different kinds of social relations as well as measuring an increasing structural diversity of PPI networks across the tree of life. Our results indicate that some types of relations are better explained by complementarity than homophily, and may be useful for improving existing link prediction methods. We also introduce a Python package implementing efficient algorithms for calculating the proposed coefficients.},

  abstract = {Graph distance and graph embedding are two fundamental tasks in graph mining. For graph distance, determining the structural dissimilarity between networks is an ill-defined problem, as there is no canonical way to compare two networks. Indeed, many of the existing approaches for network comparison differ in their heuristics, efficiency, interpretability, and theoretical soundness. Thus, having a notion of distance that is built on theoretically robust first principles and that is interpretable with respect to features ubiquitous in complex networks would allow for a meaningful comparison between different networks. For graph embedding, many of the popular methods are stochastic and depend on black-box models such as deep networks. Regardless of their high performance, this makes their results difficult to analyze which hinders their usefulness in the development of a coherent theory of complex networks. Here we rely on the theory of the length spectrum function from algebraic topology, and its relationship to the non-backtracking cycles of a graph, in order to introduce two new techniques: Non-Backtracking Spectral Distance (NBD) for measuring the distance between undirected, unweighted graphs, and Non-Backtracking Embedding Dimensions (NBED) for finding a graph embedding in low-dimensional space. Both techniques are interpretable in terms of features of complex networks such as presence of hubs, triangles, and communities. We showcase the ability of NBD to discriminate between networks in both real and synthetic data sets, as well as the potential of NBED to perform anomaly detection. By taking a topological interpretation of non-backtracking cycles, this work presents a novel application of topological data analysis to the study of complex networks.},

We discuss and prove their important properties, such as the metric property and the normalization property. We then highlight to the clustering community the importance of correcting information theoretic measures for chance, especially when the data size is small compared to the number of clusters present therein. Of the available information theoretic based measures, we advocate the normalized information distance (NID) as a general measure of choice, for it possesses concurrently several important properties, such as being both a metric and a normalized measure, admitting an exact analytical adjusted-for-chance form, and using the nominal [0, 1] range better than other normalized variants.},

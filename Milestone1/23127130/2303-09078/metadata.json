    "abstract": "We construct $O(1)\\times O(n)$-invariant ancient ``pancake'' solutions to a large and natural class of fully nonlinear curvature flows. We then establish that these are the unique $O(n)$-invariant ancient solutions to the corresponding flow which sweep out a slab by carrying out a fine asymptotic analysis for this class. This extends the main results of \\cite{BLT} to a surprisingly general class of flows.",

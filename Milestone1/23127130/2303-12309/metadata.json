    "abstract": "Quantum dynamics in a strongly-disordered quantum many-body system show localization properties. The initial state memory is maintained due to slow relaxation when the system is in the localized regime. This work demonstrates how localization can be observed using a noisy quantum computer by evaluating the magnetization and twist overlap in a quantum spin chain after a short-time evolution. Those quantities obtained from quantum-circuit simulation and real-device computation show apparent dependence on the disorder strength, although real-device computation suffers from noise-induced errors significantly. Using the exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian, this work analyzes how noise-induced errors influences those quantities. The analysis also suggests how twist overlap can reflect the information on eigenstates of the Hamiltonian.",

    "abstract": "Implicit neural representation has recently shown a promising ability in representing images with arbitrary resolutions. In this paper, we present a Local Implicit Transformer (LIT), which integrates the attention mechanism and frequency encoding technique into a local implicit image function. We design a cross-scale local attention block to effectively aggregate local features. To further improve representative power, we propose a Cascaded LIT (CLIT) that exploits multi-scale features, along with a cumulative training strategy that gradually increases the upsampling scales during training. We have conducted extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of these components and analyze various training strategies. The qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that LIT and CLIT achieve favorable results and outperform the prior works in arbitrary super-resolution tasks.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the control properties of the linearized compressible Navier-Stokes system with Maxwell's law around a constant steady state $(ρ_s, u_s, 0), ρ_s>0, u_s>0$ in the interval $(0, 2π)$ with periodic boundary data. We explore the exact controllability of the coupled system by means of a localized interior control acting in any of the equations when time is large enough. We also study the boundary exact controllability of the linearized system using a single control force when the time is sufficiently large. In both cases, we prove the exact controllability of the system in the space $L^2(0,2π)\\times L^2(0, 2π)\\times L^2(0, 2π)$. We establish the exact controllability results by proving an observability inequality with the help of an Ingham-type inequality. Moreover, we prove that the system is exactly controllable at any time if the control acts everywhere in the domain in any of the equations. Next, we prove the small time lack of controllability of the concerned system.\n  Further, using a Gramian-based approach demonstrated by Urquiza, we prove the exponential stabilizability of the corresponding closed-loop system with an arbitrary prescribed decay rate using boundary feedback control law.",

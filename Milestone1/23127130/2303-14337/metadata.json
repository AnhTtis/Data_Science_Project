    "abstract": "Emerging events, such as the COVID pandemic and the Ukraine Crisis, require a time-sensitive comprehensive understanding of the situation to allow for appropriate decision-making and effective action response. Automated generation of situation reports can significantly reduce the time, effort, and cost for domain experts when preparing their official human-curated reports. However, AI research toward this goal has been very limited, and no successful trials have yet been conducted to automate such report generation. We propose SmartBook, a novel task formulation targeting situation report generation, which consumes large volumes of news data to produce a structured situation report with multiple hypotheses (claims) summarized and grounded with rich links to factual evidence. We realize SmartBook for the Ukraine-Russia crisis by automatically generating intelligence analysis reports to assist expert analysts. The machine-generated reports are structured in the form of timelines, with each timeline organized by major events (or chapters), corresponding strategic questions (or sections) and their grounded summaries (or section content). Our proposed framework automatically detects real-time event-related strategic questions, which are more directed than manually-crafted analyst questions, which tend to be too complex, hard to parse, vague and high-level. Results from thorough qualitative evaluations show that roughly 82% of the questions in Smartbook have strategic importance, with at least 93% of the sections in the report being tactically useful. Further, experiments show that expert analysts tend to add more information into the SmartBook reports, with only 2.3% of the existing tokens being deleted, meaning SmartBook can serve as a useful foundation for analysts to build upon when creating intelligence reports.",

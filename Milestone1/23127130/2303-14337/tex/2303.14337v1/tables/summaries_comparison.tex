    Kamikaze drones, or suicide drones, have been used by Russia in its attacks on Ukrainian cities such as Kyiv, Vinnytsia and Odesa. They are known as a ``loitering munition'' because they are \textcolor{blue}{capable of waiting in an area identified as a potential target and only strike once an enemy asset is identified}. Russia is using Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones, which have a payload of approximately 50 kilograms (110 pounds) and are \textcolor{blue}{hard to detect due to their small size}. Ukraine has responded by \textcolor{blue}{developing an app that civilians can use to report sightings of incoming drones} and missiles, and increasing the proportion shot down before they hit the ground. &  Russia \textcolor{red}{and Ukraine} have been using Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones in the conflict. These drones are known as `kamikaze' drones due to their \textcolor{blue}{ability to self-destruct on impact}. The use of these drones has been highlighted by \textcolor{blue}{Russia's growing reliance on them and their use as both military weapons and psychological weapons}. On October 13, 2022, kamikaze drones and missiles hit north and south Ukraine, though the Kremlin denied any involvement from President Putin in talks between Russia and the West to end the war in Ukraine. & The Russia-Ukraine conflict has seen a \textcolor{blue}{paradigm shift in the nature of Russian tactics, with the increased reliance of kamikaze drones over artillery fire}. These drones, which are \textcolor{blue}{designed to crash into a target and explode, can spray potentially deadly debris} and are \textcolor{blue}{being used to plug gaps in the deployment of Russian forces along the front line}. Russia is reportedly using Iranian-made Shahed series drones, which are showcased at Kashan Airfield south of Tehran. This shift in tactics has seen an \textcolor{blue}{escalation in the aerial bombardment of densely populated urban areas and an attack on critical infrastructure and power sources}.\\

Question-relevant information in the summaries is highlighted in \textcolor{blue}{blue}. It can be seen that the SmartBook summary contains considerably more relevant information. The \textit{Web Search + LLM} baseline output also contains hallucinated content (highlighted in \textcolor{red}{red}) that suggests \textit{both} Russia and Ukraine have been using the `kamikaze' drones.}

    Kamikaze drones, or suicide drones, have been used by Russia in its attacks on Ukrainian cities such as Kyiv, Vinnytsia and Odesa. They are known as a ``loitering munition'' because they are \textcolor{blue}{capable of waiting in an area identified as a potential target and only strike once an enemy asset is identified}. Russia is using Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones, which have a payload of approximately 50 kilograms and are \textcolor{blue}{hard to detect due to their small size}. Ukraine has responded by \textcolor{blue}{developing an app that civilians can use to report sightings of incoming drones} and missiles, and increasing the proportion shot down before they hit the ground. &  Russia \textcolor{red}{and Ukraine} have been using Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones in the conflict. These drones are known as `kamikaze' drones due to their \textcolor{blue}{ability to self-destruct on impact}. The use of these drones has been highlighted by \textcolor{blue}{Russia's growing reliance on them and their use as both military weapons and psychological weapons}. On October 13, 2022, kamikaze drones and missiles hit north and south Ukraine, though the Kremlin denied any involvement from President Putin in talks between Russia and the West. & The Russia-Ukraine conflict has seen a \textcolor{blue}{paradigm shift in the nature of Russian tactics, with the increased reliance of kamikaze drones over artillery fire}. These drones, which are \textcolor{blue}{designed to crash into a target and explode, can spray potentially deadly debris} and are \textcolor{blue}{being used to plug gaps in the deployment of Russian forces along the front line}. Russia is reportedly using Iranian-made Shahed series drones, which are showcased at Kashan Airfield south of Tehran. This shift in tactics has seen an \textcolor{blue}{escalation in the aerial bombardment of densely populated urban areas and an attack on critical infrastructure and power sources}.\\

It can be seen that the SmartBook summary contains considerably more question-relevant information (highlighted in \textcolor{blue}{blue}). The \textit{Web Search + LLM} baseline output contains hallucinated content (highlighted in \textcolor{red}{red}) that suggests \textit{both} Russia and Ukraine have been using the drones.}

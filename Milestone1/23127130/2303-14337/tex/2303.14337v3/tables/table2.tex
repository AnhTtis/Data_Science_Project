      \textbf{Analyst-edited Summary}: Russia has reportedly stepped up its use of kamikaze drones in its assault against Ukraine. \textcolor{blue}{The aircraft are called kamikaze drones because they attack once and don’t come back.} The increased reliance on kamikaze drones over artillery fire likely signals a paradigm shift in Russian tactics - a shift introduced to counter high mobility offensive probing by Ukrainian forces. \textcolor{blue}{Their low price means the drones can be deployed in large numbers and they hover before they strike, so they have a psychological effect on civilians as they watch and wait for them to strike. These drones allow Russia to target Ukrainians far away from the front line, away from the primary battle space.} \textcolor{green}{The emergence of swarms of drones in Ukraine is part of a shift in the nature of the Russian offensive, which some speculate indicates that Moscow may be running low on long-range missiles.} \\

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec13}

In this work, we dive into the novel challenges and nuances of automated situation report generation, emphasizing the significant role of these reports in contributing to decision-makers' timely, in-depth understanding of emergent crises. Our approach, informed by a formative study and collaborative design, builds design strategies to address real-world intelligence analysts' needs. We have introduced \textbf{SmartBook}, an innovative framework crafted to generate situation reports with comprehensive, current, and factually-grounded information extracted from diverse sources. SmartBook goes beyond mere information aggregation; it presents chronologically-ordered sequences of topic-summarized events extracted from news sources and placed into a UI layout structure that aligns to the workflow of intelligence analysis. By involving analysts at each stage of SmartBook's conceptualization from design through evaluation, we pave the way for a more cohesive and productive analytical workflow. Our user study, with ten intelligence analysts and two decision-makers, validated SmartBook's effectiveness in providing grounded and easy-to-digest information with its intuitive interface. Both intelligence analysts and decision-makers found SmartBook to be usable, feasible to integrate into operational environments, and trustworthy.



%In this paper, we present the novel task of automated situation report generation, which is pertinent for timely and scalable complex event understanding of emergent crises. This problem formulation differs from the traditional multi-document news summarization domain in that it requires comprehensive, broad coverage of important information, which is to be presented in a structured format that is spread across a timeline.
%In addition, the vast amount of information needs to be organized into chapters and sections with a strategic structure to facilitate analysis and planning. To address these challenges, we propose \textit{SmartBook}, a generalizable framework for clustering news topics and summarizing news claims automatically. SmartBook offers automated generation of situation reports as an initial draft consolidating information to assist analysts, not to replace them. 

%For future work, we aim to explore the following avenues to improve the reliability and expand the scope of SmartBook:

%\begin{itemize}
  %  \item \textbf{Controlling the bias of sources:} To control bias in SmartBook, we will cross-check information from various news sources with differing angles, levels of detail, and interpretations, and also consider independent sources from the left, center, and right to identify alternate perspectives and hypotheses. \\
%    \item \textbf{Adding more languages:} By incorporating news articles from various languages, we plan to capture diverse perspectives, insights, and information on global events, while also enabling analysts to understand local customs, cultures, and nuances that influence event interpretation, ultimately presenting a more comprehensive and accurate picture. \\
 %   \item \textbf{Verifying the extracted claims:} Since situation reports inform strategic planning, we will provide a trustworthiness verification score for each SmartBook claim to ensure accuracy and prevent misguided actions, with lower scores indicating the need for further analyst oversight before final report inclusion.

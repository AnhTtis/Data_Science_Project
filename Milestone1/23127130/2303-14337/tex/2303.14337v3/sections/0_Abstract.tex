 %Emerging events require timely and comprehensive situation understanding for effective decision-making and response. Automated generation of situation reports can reduce the time, effort, and cost of intelligence analysts when preparing their official reports. 
Timely and comprehensive understanding of emerging events is crucial for effective decision-making; automating situation report generation can significantly reduce the time, effort, and cost for intelligence analysts. Through a formative study and collaborative design sessions, we identify intelligence analysts' practices and preferences for AI assistance in situation report generation to guide the design strategies for an effective, trust-building interface that aligns with their thought processes and needs. Next, we introduce SmartBook, an automated framework designed to generate situation reports from large volumes of news data, creating structured reports by automatically discovering event-related strategic questions. These reports include multiple hypotheses (claims), summarized and grounded to sources with factual evidence, to promote in-depth situation understanding. %Next, we propose SmartBook, an automated framework for generating situation reports: given large volumes of news data, produce a structured report with multiple hypotheses (claims) summarized and grounded to sources with factual evidence. %These reports are structured as a sequence of timespans, each consisting of major events.
 %SmartBook automatically discovers event-related strategic questions, with their grounded summaries promoting in-depth situation understanding. 
Our comprehensive evaluation of SmartBook, encompassing a user study alongside a content review with an editing study, reveals SmartBook's effectiveness in generating accurate and relevant situation reports that further benefit from human analyst refinement.
 %\textcolor{blue}{\textbf{TODO: Revanth - Change the below once we have user study results. They were criticized as 'over-claims' by reviewers.}} 
 %SmartBook offers an intuitive human-centric design that is amenable to intelligence analysis.  Qualitative evaluations indicate over 80\% of questions probe for strategic information, and over 90\% of summaries produce tactically useful content. Experts tend to add more information to the generated reports than they remove (under 2.5\% of existing tokens), indicating SmartBook provides analysts with a valuable foundation for situation reports. %SmartBook offers an intuitive and efficient approach to situation report generation, for reading and writing.

%\revanth{I now added a sentence related to strategic questions, but we're pretty constrained for space as CHI has a 150 word abstract limit}
%\heng{Can you add some emphasis on the unique functions of Smartbook including strategivally chapter and section/question generation? I think we need to add a bit intro to motivate the task.}

 \section{System Evaluation Overview}
To comprehensively evaluate SmartBook and its efficacy in aiding intelligence analysis, our approach encompassed two distinct but interrelated studies: a user study and a content review. The user study (in (\S{\ref{sec:usability_study}}) aimed to answer four research questions concerning SmartBook's usability, focusing on its effectiveness for intelligence analysts and decision-makers in generating and interacting with situation reports. Complementing this, the content review (in \S{\ref{sec:content_review_study}})  assessed the quality of SmartBook's summaries, focusing on readability, coherence, and relevance, alongside an editing study where an expert analyst edited the generated reports to understand their utility as preliminary utility. These combined efforts provided a holistic understanding of SmartBook's practicality and effectiveness in the field of intelligence analysis, offering insights into both its user experience and content quality.

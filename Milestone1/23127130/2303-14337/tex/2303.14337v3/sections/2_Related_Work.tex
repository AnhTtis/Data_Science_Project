%\textcolor{red}{need to extend each step in the first paragraph}

% \textcolor{blue}{Situation reports are pivotal in intelligence analysis, often requiring a synthesis of complex, and sometimes conflicting data from various sources. The introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools like SmartBook promises to revolutionize this process, offering an automated framework for report creation, which can serve as a foundational draft for intelligence analysts. In this section, we delve into the current landscape of AI in intelligence analysis and position SmartBook's innovation in this space.}

AI has ushered in a new era for intelligence analysis, as traditional methods can be often tedious and time-consuming. AI, however, can manage vast data sets and swiftly analyze information, ensuring accurate and timely insights. The intelligence analysis begins with data collection and ingestion, where automated tools play a pivotal role in efficient categorization and storage as highlighted by studies~\cite{stottlemyre2015humint, billman2006collaborative,pohl2012automatic}. These tools gather data from diverse sources, simplifying access for further analysis.
%AI has ushered in a new era for intelligence analysis. Traditional methods, though efficient, are often tedious and time-consuming. AI, however, can manage vast data sets and swiftly analyze information, ensuring accurate and timely insights. The initial step in intelligence analysis involves data collection and ingestion. As highlighted by studies like ~\cite{stottlemyre2015humint, billman2006collaborative,pohl2012automatic}, automated tools are crucial for this phase. They ensure a streamlined categorization and storage of data from an array of sources, making it easily accessible for subsequent processing. 
%\heng{maybe give some stats about how much time human analysts usually need to spend on drafting a report, and they can only update the report once every two weeks. You can check some wording in my slides: \url{https://blender.cs.illinois.edu/ALTA\_NLP\_SmartBook\_HengJi.pdf}}
In the domain of data visualization and examination~\cite{prunckun2010handbook}, AI significantly enhances the ability to discern complex data patterns, aiding analysts in drawing meaningful inferences. Furthermore, the assessment of evidence reliability is crucial. AI-driven tools can systematically evaluate information credibility, ensuring the use of verified data~\cite{barnes2016making, toniolo2014making}. Further, they can examine the depth and accuracy of insights, verifying the validity of intelligence reports~\cite{brody2011automatic}.
%The realm of data visualization and inspection has also benefited immensely from AI. Tools recommended by Prunckun et al. ~\cite{prunckun2010handbook} aid analysts in visualizing intricate data patterns, thereby aiding the drawing of meaningful conclusions. It's imperative to determine the reliability of the sourced evidence. AI-driven tools, as suggested by Barnes~\cite{barnes2016making} and Toniolo et al. ~\cite{toniolo2014making}, serve this purpose by systematically evaluating the credibility of the information, ensuring analysts work with verified and reliable data. ~\cite{brody2011automatic} introduced tools that scrutinize the depth and accuracy of insights, certifying the produced intelligence reports' validity.
%\heng{here maybe add a sentence to say that we partially solved this problem by making sure claims are carefully extracted and grounded into source, and thus 98\% of the information in our report draft is accurate and thus users can spend minimal time on inspection}
AI innovations, such as those exemplified by HITIQA~\cite{small-etal-2004-hitiqa-scenario}, have facilitated scenario-based question answering, essential for dissecting specific situations and deriving precise insights. This approach is crucial in intelligence analysis, where generating potential hypotheses is a key aspect~\cite{heuer1999psychology, cerutti2018cispaces}. While these developments represent significant progress, challenges persist. Studies~\cite{van2020improving,xia2019trace,pirolli2005sensemaking,pioch2006polestar,toniolo2023human} point out that current tools often require extensive crowdsourcing or necessitate human-machine collaboration for report drafting, highlighting the need for further improvement in this area.

Further, the generation of potential hypotheses is a core component of intelligence analysis. ~\cite{heuer1999psychology, cerutti2018cispaces} have advanced this process, offering a range of probable scenarios for analysts to consider. However, despite these advancements, challenges remain. Current tools, ~\cite{van2020improving, xia2019trace} point out, often demand extensive crowd-sourcing or necessitate human-machine collaborations for report drafting, as evidenced by research from~\cite{pirolli2005sensemaking, pioch2006polestar, toniolo2023human}.

%Automatic tools assist intelligence analysts in data collection, data inspection and visualization~\cite{prunckun2010handbook}, evidence credibility assessment~\cite{toniolo2014making,barnes2016making}, scenario-based question answering~\cite{small-etal-2004-hitiqa-scenario}, hypotheses generation~\cite{heuer1999psychology, cerutti2018cispaces}, and quality valuation~\cite{brody2011automatic}.
SmartBook brings in a significant advancement in automated situation report generation. SmartBook aims to produce initial report drafts, allowing analysts to channel their energies on critical thinking and comprehensive assessments. Additionally, the system's integration of a large language model aids in topic discovery, navigating the longstanding issue of analysts being unaware of unknown factors. By generating strategic questions for varying events, it guides analysts towards previously unseen patterns, prompting the exploration of new hypotheses, even when confronted with contradictory information. In an age where data inundation is a constant challenge for intelligence analysts, tools like SmartBook offer not just relief, but a pathway to enhanced efficiency and deeper insights. This research underscores the promise of SmartBook, positioning it as a significant milestone in AI-assisted intelligence analysis.

\subsection{Multi-Document Summarization}
Multi-document summarization aims to extract critical information across multiple documents into a few-sentence summary~\citep{fabbri-etal-2019-multi, abdi2017query, li2014improving, xiong2018multi, abdi2018qmos, abdi2018machine, deyoung2021ms2}.
Large Language Models (LLMs) have also shown unprecedented ability to generate summaries~\citep{zhang2023extractive,zhang2023benchmarking, yang2023exploring, zhang2023enhancing, wang2023zero, zeng2023meta}.
SmartBook differs from these summarization tools with its structural narratives, its focus on situational intelligence, and its automatic event-related question discovery.
First, the current summarization methods lack the organizational structure needed for intelligence situation reports, which require synthesizing diverse data points into a coherent narrative. 
SmartBook, by contrast, generates inherently structured reports that are broken down into time spans, major events, strategic questions, and their grounded summaries.
This layered structure, reminiscent of a book, provides a comprehensive view and intuitive navigation through the complex scenario being analyzed.
Second, while news summarization aims to provide a condensed version of events, SmartBook not only states what happened but also explores multiple aspects including implications, potential trajectories, and strategic importance of these events.
Third, previous query-based methods rely on human effort to identify important events as guidance or prompts, while SmartBook introduces an innovative mechanism to discover pertinent event-related questions automatically, allowing the system to probe deeper into events to offer users richer insights. 

\begin{comment}
The challenge of synthesizing information from multiple sources is a long-standing one in the fields of information retrieval and natural language processing. SmartBook builds upon these traditions but adapts them to the nuanced requirements of situation reports for end-user usage.

Automatic news summarization has been the focus of significant research~\cite{mani2001automatic}, aiming to help readers quickly grasp the main points from vast daily news articles.  Early methods relied heavily on extracting salient sentences from the articles based on word frequency and location~\cite{luhn1958automatic}. Later efforts, like TextRank~\cite{mihalcea2004graph}, use graph-based models to rank sentences. Following work on knowledge-enhanced summarization extracts useful information with prior knowledge, such as sentence similarity~\cite{wan2008exploration}, semantic role \citep{yan2014srrank, khan2015framework, khan2015genetic, alshaina2017multi}, Yago knowledge base~\citep{baralis2013multi}, and dependency parsing~\cite{kurisinkel2017abstractive}. While effective for generating short news summaries, these methods lack the depth and organizational structure needed for intelligence situation reports, which require synthesizing diverse data points into a coherent narrative. SmartBook, instead, identifies events, actors, and their relationships, organizing these into a structured report.

Summarizing multiple news articles into an situation analysis report is a new type of multi-document summarization~\cite{fabbri-etal-2019-multi, abdi2017query, li2014improving, xiong2018multi, abdi2018qmos, abdi2018machine}, which aims to extract critical information across multiple documents with particular guidance, such as sentiments~\citep{abdi2018machine}, queries \citep{abdi2018qmos}, and document structures~\citep{deyoung2021ms2}, into a few-sentence summary~\citep{fabbri-etal-2019-multi}. By contrast, the guidance in our query-based situation report summarization is identified and organized event knowledge in real-world scenarios (e.g., COVID and Russia-Ukraine Crisis). SmartBook’s goal expands past information summarization to the creation of an in-depth situation report based on multiple data streams. What sets SmartBook apart from traditional summarization tools is its focus on `situational intelligence'. While news summarization aims to provide a condensed version of events, SmartBook not only states what happened but also explores multiple aspects includiong implications, potential trajectories, and strategic importance of these events.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have set benchmarks in various natural language processing tasks, with their unprecedented ability to generate human-like text. Specifically, for text summarization, they have been used to produce extractive \cite{zhang2023extractive}, abstractive \cite{zhang2023benchmarking}, query-based \cite{yang2023exploring}, cross-document \cite{zhang2023enhancing} and cross-lingual summaries \cite{wang2023zero}. 
%However, SmartBook rises above conventional LLM-driven summarization by tailoring its capabilities to the domain of situation report generation.
Unlike generic LLM summaries that are linear and often lack detailed organization, SmartBook generates reports that are inherently structured, broken down into timespans, major events, strategic questions, and their grounded summaries. This layered structure, reminiscent of a book, provides a comprehensive view and intuitive navigation through the complex scenario being analyzed. Traditional summarization with LLMs, even if query-based, relies on external prompts. In contrast, SmartBook introduces an innovative mechanism to discover pertinent event-related questions automatically, allowing the system to probe deeper into events to offer users with richer insights. \heng{here we need to talk about LLM hallucination problem and how smartbook solves that problem}

%Our work is closely related to knowledge-enhanced summarization, which extracts useful information with prior knowledge, such as sentence similarity~\cite{wan2008exploration}, semantic role \citep{yan2014srrank, khan2015framework, khan2015genetic, alshaina2017multi}, Yago knowledge base~\citep{baralis2013multi}, and dependency parsing~\cite{kurisinkel2017abstractive}. 
%Nevertheless, the above methods do not meet the requirements for situation reports, as their outputs are typically short and do not organize events described in multiple documents, unlike SmartBook.

%\subsection{AI-Assisted Writing}


%\revanth{As per reviewer comments, this section needs to be rewritten to focus less on `collaborative writing/co-authoring` as SmartBook doesn't really provide iterative report generation, to be classified as co-authoring or collaborative.}
%AI-assisted writing~\cite{WangACL2019,Wang2020,selfcollaboration2023,cardon2023challenges} is a rapidly growing field in human-computer interaction research. In recent years, researchers have explored various approaches to develop AI systems that can assist users in writing tasks. AI-assisted writing tools have demonstrated benefits to a variety of end-users, like academics~\cite{gero2022sparks}, screenwriters~\cite{mirowski2023co} and developers~\cite{chen2021evaluating}. CoAuthor~\cite{lee2022coauthor} crafts a dataset that encapsulates the rich interactions observed between multiple writers and instances of GPT-3 over numerous writing sessions, thereby highlighting the efficacy of AI in fostering collaborative writing endeavors. In the area of automated story-writing~\cite{klein1973automatic}, attempts such as Creative Help~\cite{roemmele2015creative}, Writing Buddy~\cite{samuel2016design} and WordCraft~\cite{yuan2022wordcraft} aid the user in producing full stories with creative control throughout the process. More recently, with humans struggling to identify text as being machine generated ~\cite{wahle2022large}, concerns have been raised about academic integrity~\cite{perkins2023academic} and plagiarism\cite{wahle2022identifying} when using AI-assisted writing tools. In light of the ongoing developments in the AI-assisted writing, SmartBook introduces a unique automated framework designed specifically for generating situation reports for intelligence analysts. While the existing body of work predominantly focuses on augmenting creative and collaborative writing, SmartBook seamlessly integrates with analysts' workflows, emphasizing efficiency, analytical depth, and breadth. 

%\subsection{Structured Report Generation in other domains}

%\textcolor{blue}{Structured report generation has become pivotal across a multitude of domains, driven by the quest to extract meaningful insights from vast datasets. Medicine is one of the domains where structured report generation has gained significant traction. Natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision algorithms have been used to generate radiology reports by analyzing medical images \cite{kisilev2015medical, monshi2020deep}. In the finance sector, firms leverage machine learning and AI models to sift through vast amounts of financial data to produce concise, structured quarterly or yearly financial reports~\cite{}. }

%\textcolor{blue}{In the domain of meteorological reporting, AI's application spans from predicting weather patterns to offering detailed narratives~\cite{leon2002intelligent, sripada2014case}. Sports analytics, on the backdrop of rising demand, has moved towards converting raw match data into post-match summaries, aiding analysts and enthusiasts alike in deciphering game dynamics~\cite{araujo2021artificial, bhatnagar2022systematic}. Similarly, the urgency of environmental concerns has spurred the use of satellite data integrated with machine learning algorithms, producing environmental reports on critical subjects such as deforestation and urbanization~\cite{van2014environmental, piedelobo2018hidromap}.}

%\textcolor{blue}{Lastly, the corporate sector, especially e-commerce, has not remained untouched. Businesses, overwhelmed with vast pools of data, employ AI-driven tools to decode this data and produce structured reports. These reports offer pivotal insights into sales trends, customer behaviors, and market dynamics, thus aiding decision-making processes~\cite{negash2004business}. Such extensive applications across various sectors underscore the potential of AI-driven tools, with SmartBook aiming to assist intelligence analysts by presenting them with thorough situation reports.}

Important events and emerging crises come with a vast amount of news updates, which may result in an information overload for decision-makers and public interests. Automatic generation of a \textbf{SmartBook} can largely alleviate the time and cost of manual curation efforts, and enable timely presentation of organized information, in support of prompt reactions and tactical operations. \heng{define what is smartbook} Along this direction, previous news summarization formulations attempt to condense the overlapping information across multiple news documents into a brief paragraph.


However, the existing approaches to news report generation typically come with two natural shortcomings, lacking \textit{comprehensiveness} and \textit{structure}. While current techniques are still limited to paragraph-length summarizations, the real-world aggregated reports that people utilize as actionable references ({\i.e.} Wikipedia pages, government organization intel reports, etc.) are much more detailed, in the order of two-digit number of pages. In addition, the generation of a comprehensive, detailed report is not only about increasing the minimum token length, but also maintaining a structure and organizing related events addressing a similar subtopic/query as individual chapters.

In this work, we present a novel formulation of \textbf{SmartBook} generation, which for any set of questions ({\em} i.e. chapter headers), automatically summaries the claims from multiple sources and multiple languages. This \textbf{SmartBook} also grounds the information elements in the report to an interactive, multimedia knowledge graph, with relevant images included. Additionally, our \textbf{SmartBook} framework explores inferring a final, "perspective" section that predicts probable future events.

    "abstract": "In this paper we present experimental and numerical reference data for a NACA 64A-110 airfoil at two angles of attack for $Ma=0.72$ and a Reynolds number of $Re_c=930.000$ with respect to the chord length. The test cases are designed to provide data for an uninclined airfoil at $0^\\circ$ and for the case of a stable, steady shock at $3^\\circ$. For both cases we conduct experiments in the trisonic wind tunnel at the RWTH Aachen including PIV data as well as numerical wall-resolved large eddy simulations. The results show matching mean velocities and Reynolds stresses in the wake and boundary layer region. The experiment shows a stronger shock including a lambda structure, but the shock location and the overall flow physics are in good agreement for the tested angles of attack. The generated data can be used for code validation, feature development and turbulence modeling.",

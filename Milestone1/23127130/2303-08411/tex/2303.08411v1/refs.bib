   abstract = {This paper presents an attempt to reduce the computational complexity, while achieving acceptable level of noise reduction in a multi-channel active noise control (MCANC) system for mitigating noise passing through open windows. The reference signals are sensed at the back of the secondary loudspeakers. The existing approach to reduce the computational complexity has already used only one reference signal in each feedforward channel. As the number of error microphones is also important to ensure global noise reduction of the MCANC system for open windows, the main idea of this paper is to preprocess the error signals so that the number of inputs to the controller is further reduced. When the preprocessing is a simple summation, it is called the mixed-error approach. The number of inputs related to the error signals is eventually reduced to 1 after the mixed-error approach is applied. Simulation results demonstrate that the optimum control filters derived under general conditions can lead to similar global noise reduction to those derived based on the mixed-error approach. Experimental results confirm that in a 4-channel MCANC system applied to a 0.2m by 0.2m open window, the performance of global noise reduction is not compromised by the mixed-error approach.},

   abstract = {In this paper, we propose a multichannel active noise control (ANC) system combined with noise source separation by microphone arrays. A multichannel feedforward ANC system uses multiple reference microphones located close to noise sources and can reduce various acoustic noises such as broadband noise. In general, it is difficult to place the reference microphones close to the noise sources owing to physical constraints. In this case, the reference signals, which are the outputs of reference microphones, are highly correlated with each other, the noise reduction performance of the multichannel ANC system is degraded. In other words, the reference microphones detect the highly correlated noises, reducing the noise reduction ability of the ANC system. To solve this problem, a multichannel feedforward ANC system with a noise source separation technique is proposed. This system uses microphone arrays located at the reference microphone positions. The mixed signal is separated from the target noise and other components by noise source separation and the separated signals are used to update the noise control filters. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ANC system can separate the target noise and the disturbance noise and effectively reduce the target noise.},

Sound Vib. 419, 405–419, 2018) for improving the sound transmission loss of open windows by distributing an array of loudspeakers evenly on the opening. This paper investigates the feasibility of the boundary control for sound transmission through an opening, which only installs the secondary sources on its frame and thus has advantages of better ventilation and easier access. An analytical model is developed first to obtain the sound field transmitted into a cavity with a baffled opening by using the modal expansion method, and then the performances of the boundary control systems are investigated for different primary source and secondary source configurations numerically based on the model. The wavelength corresponding to the upper limit effective frequency of the proposed boundary control system with more than 10 dB noise reduction is found to be equal to the length of the short sides of the opening. Finally, experimental results are presented to verify the discoveries.},

   abstract = {Although decentralized control has great potential to facilitate multi-channel active noise/vibration control (ANC/AVC) systems, the practical implementations are greatly restricted by its inherent risk of system instability. In this paper, an optimized decentralized filtered-x least mean square algorithm is proposed for over-determined ANC/AVC systems subject to periodic disturbances. A diagonal parametric matrix is added into the update equations and a set of nonlinear equations is established with respect to the diagonal elements of this parametric matrix. An assumption is made and is verified through simulations that the nonlinear equations are solvable and have multiple solutions. With these solutions, all the eigenvalues of the characteristic matrix corresponding to system stability can be forced close to the point (1,0) in the complex domain. Convergence behaviors of the proposed algorithm are analysed in both frequency-domain and time-domain, through which the existence and characteristics of the convergence ripples are revealed. A criterion function is further established for the diagonal parametric matrix so that the convergence ripples can be restricted in an average sense. Simulations and experiments based on a multi-channel ANC system are carried out to validate the proposed algorithm. Corresponding results demonstrate that, compared with the original decentralized control, the proposed algorithm has advantages of guaranteed stability and accelerated convergence rates over the whole control frequency band without performance degradation as well as extra computational cost.},

   abstract = {Active noise control (ANC) systems have been widely used to reduce noise from indoor or outdoor sources, e.g. traffic, office/factory machines and ventilating systems. Since noise control usually needs to be executed within an extended area, the ANC network that involves a large amount of error microphones and loudspeakers is frequently employed. Distribution of the controller network saves computational burden and yields spatial diversity, which enhances the robustness of the system. This paper studies the diffusion (Diff) control for multi-channel ANC systems using filtered-x (Fx) least mean squares (LMS) algorithms. Since communication between nodes within the network makes it difficult to analyze the performance of the entire system, a comprehensive performance analysis of networked FxLMS algorithm is not available currently in literature to our best knowledge. In this paper, the convergence behavior of the Diff-FxLMS algorithm is investigated. The mean and mean squares difference equations are derived, from which the stability of the networked ANC system is analyzed and the steady-state excess mean square errors (EMSEs) for ANC controllers are obtained. Computer simulations are conducted to compare different control methods and verify the theoretical analysis. A specific 10-node network is studied in terms of the network strategy and the noise reduction performance. Moreover, using the proposed theoretical analysis, a systematic and simple design procedure for Diff-FxLMS based ANC systems is proposed. The usefulness of the theoretical analysis and design procedure is demonstrated by means of a design example.},

The computational burden is dispersed among the nodes over the networks. A comprehensive statistical analysis of the algorithm is conducted to better understand its convergence properties. Specifically, we investigate the convergence behavior of the weight-error vector in the mean and mean-square sense. Based on this analysis, the stability bound of the system is discussed. The expressions for steady-state mean-square deviation (MSD) and excess mean-square error (EMSE) are derived.

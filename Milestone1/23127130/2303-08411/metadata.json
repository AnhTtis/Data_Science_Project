    "abstract": "By assigning the massive computing tasks of the traditional multichannel active noise control (MCANC) system to several distributed control nodes, distributed multichannel active noise control (DMCANC) techniques have become effective global noise reduction solutions with low computational costs. However, existing DMCANC algorithms simply complete the distribution of traditional centralized algorithms by combining neighbour nodes' information but rarely consider the degraded control performance and system stability of distributed units caused by delays and interruptions in communication. Hence, this paper develops a novel DMCANC algorithm that utilizes the compensation filters and neighbour nodes' information to counterbalance the cross-talk effect between channels while maintaining independent weight updating. Since the neighbours' information required barely affects the local control filter updating in each node, this approach can tolerate communication delay and interruption to some extent. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve satisfactory noise reduction performance and high robustness to real-world communication challenges.",

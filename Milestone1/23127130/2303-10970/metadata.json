    "abstract": "The Sorted L-One Estimator (SLOPE) is a popular regularization method in regression, which induces clustering of the estimated coefficients. That is, the estimator can have coefficients of identical magnitude. In this paper, we derive an asymptotic distribution of SLOPE for the ordinary least squares, Huber, and Quantile loss functions, and use it to study the clustering behavior in the limit. This requires a stronger type of convergence since clustering properties do not follow merely from the classical weak convergence. We establish asymptotic control of the false discovery rate for the asymptotic orthogonal design of the regressor. We also show how to extend the framework to a broader class of regularizers other than SLOPE.",

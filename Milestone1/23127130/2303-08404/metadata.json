    "abstract": "Resonant tunneling transport in polar heterostructures is intimately connected to the polarization fields emerging from the geometric Berry-phase. In these structures, quantum confinement results not only in a discrete electronic spectrum, but also in built-in polarization charges exhibiting a broken inversion symmetry along the transport direction. Thus, electrons undergo highly asymmetric quantum interference effects with respect to the direction of current flow. By employing doping to counter the broken symmetry, we deterministically control the resonant transmission through GaN/AlN resonant tunneling diodes and experimentally demonstrate the recovery of symmetric resonant tunneling injection across the noncentrosymmetric double-barrier potential.",

% 
% Bib files are VERY PICKY about syntax, more so than python
% Don't mix your Ps and Qs or commas and brackets.
% 
% Check your line endings end in a comma,
%
% Always separate AUTHORs by "and"
% AUTHOR1 and AUTHOR2 and AUTHOR3 and AUTHOR4 and ..... and AUTHORX
% where AUTHORX is   Lastname, Firstname   or   Firstname Lastname
% Put ALL the authors, not et al. 
%
% When you get arbitrary downloads ALWAYS check the copyright, and ask or inform
% the institution/author if this is required. Citing is not enough, some
% material may not be used. 
%
% For web published items, because they can change, put YEAR = "Accessed in April 2012",
% and if the item has a publish date, put that in the HOWPUBLISHED field after
% the institutions's name, (then publish date, then \url{}).
% Always find the original URL, not some Google Docs upload where you saved it
%
% Never put %comments in the middle of a bibtex file; they cause problems
% too often.
%
% Remove the .bbl, .blg, .aux, ,.out files if your bibtex gets stuck 
% on errors (some non-ascii characters can cause this) and rerun in
% a terminal if texmaker does not tell you what the problem is.

    "abstract": "Sharding is used to address the performance and scalability issues of the blockchain protocols, which divides the overall transaction processing costs among multiple clusters of nodes. Shards require less storage capacity and communication and computation cost per node than the existing whole blockchain networks, and they operate in parallel to maximize performance. However, existing sharding solutions use locks for transaction isolation which lowers the system throughput and may introduce deadlocks. In this paper, we propose a lockless transaction method for ensuring transaction isolation without using locks, which improves the concurrency and throughput of the transactions. In our method, transactions are split into subtransactions to enable parallel processing in multiple shards. We use versions for the transaction accounts to implement consistency among the shards. We provide formal proof for liveness and correctness. We also evaluate experimentally our proposed protocol and compare the execution time and throughput with lock-based approaches. The experiments show that the transaction execution time is considerably shorter than the lock-based time and near to the ideal (no-lock) execution time.",

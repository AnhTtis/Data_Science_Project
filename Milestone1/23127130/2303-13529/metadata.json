    "abstract": "For network administration and maintenance, it is critical to anticipate when networks will receive peak volumes of traffic so that adequate resources can be allocated to service requests made to servers. In the event that sufficient resources are not allocated to servers, they can become prone to failure and security breaches. On the contrary, we would waste a lot of resources if we always allocate the maximum amount of resources. Therefore, anticipating peak volumes in network traffic becomes an important problem. However, popular forecasting models such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) forecast time-series data generally, thus lack in predicting peak volumes in these time-series. More than often, a time-series is a combination of different features, which may include but are not limited to 1) Trend, the general movement of the traffic volume, 2) Seasonality, the patterns repeated over some time periods (e.g. daily and monthly), and 3) Noise, the random changes in the data. Considering that the fluctuation of seasonality can be harmful for trend and peak prediction, we propose to extract seasonalities to facilitate the peak volume predictions in the time domain. The experiments on both synthetic and real network traffic data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

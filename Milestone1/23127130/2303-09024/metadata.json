    "abstract": "An increased energy demand, and environmental pressure to accommodate higher levels of renewable energy and flexible loads like electric vehicles have led to numerous smart transformations in the modern power systems. These transformations make the cyber-physical power system highly susceptible to cyber-adversaries targeting its numerous operations. In this work, a novel black box adversarial attack strategy is proposed targeting the AC state estimation operation of an unknown power system using historical data. Specifically, false data is injected into the measurements obtained from a small subset of the power system components which leads to significant deviations in the state estimates. Experiments carried out on the IEEE 39 bus and 118 bus test systems make it evident that the proposed strategy, called DeeBBAA, can evade numerous conventional and state-of-the-art attack detection mechanisms with very high probability.",

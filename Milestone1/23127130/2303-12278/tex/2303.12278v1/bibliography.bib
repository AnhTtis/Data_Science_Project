abstract = {As technology has evolved, cities have become increasingly smart. Smart mobility is a crucial element in smart cities, and autonomous vehicles are an essential part of smart mobility. However, vulnerabilities in autonomous vehicles can be damaging to quality of life and human safety. For this reason, many security researchers have studied attacks and defenses for autonomous vehicles. However, there has not been systematic research on attacks and defenses for autonomous vehicles. In this survey, we analyzed previously conducted attack and defense studies described in 151 papers from 2008 to 2019 for a systematic and comprehensive investigation of autonomous vehicles. We classified autonomous attacks into the three categories of autonomous control system, autonomous driving systems components, and vehicle-to-everything communications. Defense against such attacks was classified into security architecture, intrusion detection, and anomaly detection. Due to the development of big data and communication technologies, techniques for detecting abnormalities using artificial intelligence and machine learning are gradually being developed. Lastly, we provide implications based on our systemic survey that future research on autonomous attacks and defenses is strongly combined with artificial intelligence and major component of smart cities.}

	abstract = {Intelligent vehicle technologies have been developed rapidly. Modern vehicles include many Electronic Control Units (ECUs) and in-vehicle networks. While these technologies offer accurate vehicle control and increase the convenience and safety of drivers, their vulnerabilities also have been analyzed and exploited. Nevertheless, open platforms, such as the Android OS, have been introduced into vehicle systems without careful consideration about security issues. In this paper, we indicate the security problems of an Android OS-based telematics system. Our target device's firmware is offered on a public Web site and is easily analyzed using public analysis tools. This means that our analysis methods are more scalable and practical than previous ones for remote attacks that require difficult analysis skills, such as signal processing and reverse engineering. We also found that the device allows malicious firmware to be updated because of a problem related to misuse of certificates. Furthermore, we conducted attack experiments using a real vehicle.},

	abstract = {In recent years, there has been significant interest in developing autonomous vehicles such as self-driving cars. In-vehicle communications, due to simplicity and reliability, a Controller Area Network (CAN) bus is widely used as the de facto standard to provide serial communications between Electronic Control Units (ECUs). However, prior research reveals that several network-level attacks can be performed due to the lack of defense mechanisms in the CAN bus. In this work, we propose CAN Bus Message Attack Detection Framework (CAN-ADF) - a comprehensive anomaly generation, detection, and evaluation system for a CAN bus. In CAN-ADF, not only various anomalies and attack characteristics can be configured but also different detection methods, and visualization frameworks are provided to effectively detect those attacks and anomalies. For the detector, we employ both a rule-based approach crafted from dynamic network traffic characteristics and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). For evaluation, we use 7,875,791 in-vehicle CAN packets collected from real cars, KIA Soul and Hyundai Sonata. Our detection algorithm achieves accurate intrusion detection performance, with an average accuracy of 99.45% on CAN datasets, outperforming prior approach. Furthermore, we developed a visualization tool to validate the detection of anomalies by CAN-ADF and to find new patterns in the dataset.},

@article{SongWK20,
	abstract = {The implementation of electronics in modern vehicles has resulted in an increase in attacks targeting in-vehicle networks; thus, attack detection models have caught the attention of the automotive industry and its researchers. Vehicle network security is an urgent and significant problem because the malfunctioning of vehicles can directly affect human and road safety. The controller area network (CAN), which is used as a de facto standard for in-vehicle networks, does not have sufficient security features, such as message encryption and sender authentication, to protect the network from cyber-attacks. In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection system (IDS) based on a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) to protect the CAN bus of the vehicle. The DCNN learns the network traffic patterns and detects malicious traffic without hand-designed features. We designed the DCNN model, which was optimized for the data traffic of the CAN bus, to achieve high detection performance while reducing the unnecessary complexity in the architecture of the Inception-ResNet model. We performed an experimental study using the datasets we built with a real vehicle to evaluate our detection system. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed IDS has significantly low false negative rates and error rates when compared to the conventional machine-learning algorithms.},

@article{KangK16,
	abstract = {A novel intrusion detection system (IDS) using a deep neural network (DNN) is proposed to enhance the security of in-vehicular network. The parameters building the DNN structure are trained with probability-based feature vectors that are extracted from the in-vehicular network packets. For a given packet, the DNN provides the probability of each class discriminating normal and attack packets, and, thus the sensor can identify any malicious attack to the vehicle. As compared to the traditional artificial neural network applied to the IDS, the proposed technique adopts recent advances in deep learning studies such as initializing the parameters through the unsupervised pre-training of deep belief networks (DBN), therefore improving the detection accuracy. It is demonstrated with experimental results that the proposed technique can provide a real-time response to the attack with a significantly improved detection ratio in controller area network (CAN) bus.},

This communication network was not developed with cybersecurity in mind. Many methods based on constant time intervals between messages have been proposed to address this lack of security issue with the CAN bus. However, these existing methods may struggle to handle variable time intervals between messages during transitions of vehicle driving modes. This paper proposes a simple and cost-effective method to ensure the security of the CAN bus that is based on constant message frequencies across vehicle driving modes. This proposed method does not require any modifications on the existing CAN bus and it is designed with the intent for efficient execution in platforms with very limited computational resources. Test results with the proposed method against two different vehicles and a frequency domain analysis are also presented in the paper.},

@article{MarkovitzW17,
	abstract = {This paper describes a novel domain-aware anomaly detection system for in-car CAN bus traffic. Through inspection of real {CAN} bus communication, we discovered the presence of semantically-meaningful Constant fields, Multi-Value fields and Counter or Sensor fields. For CAN networks in which the specifications of the electronic control units (ECUs) are unknown, and hence, the borders between the bit-fields are unknown, we developed a greedy algorithm to split the messages into fields and classify the fields into the types we observed. Next, we designed a semantically-aware anomaly detection system for CAN bus traffic. In its learning phase, our system uses the classifier to characterize the fields and build a model for the messages, based on their field types. The model is based on Ternary Content-Addressable Memory (TCAM), that can run efficiently in either software or hardware. During the enforcement phase our system detects deviations from the model. We evaluated our system on simulated CAN bus traffic, and achieved very encouraging results: a median false positive rate of 1% with a median of only 89.5 TCAMs. Finally we evaluated our system on the real CAN bus traffic. With a sufficiently long period of recording, we achieved a median false positive rate of 0% with an average of 252 TCAMs.},

	abstract = {The CAN (Controller Area Network) bus connects different Electronic Control Units (ECU) inside a vehicle. Valuable information about the state of the vehicle is present on this bus and is useful to track driver behaviour, the health of the vehicle, etc. However, the configuration of this bus is not publicly disclosed by the car manufacturers. Therefore, reverse engineering techniques need to be applied. Nevertheless, performing these techniques manually is cumbersome and time consuming. In this paper, we propose an automation of the analysis steps of reverse engineering in order to improve and facilitate the process. Two approaches of automation are discussed, namely an arithmetic approach and machine learning using classification. In conclusion, we show that reverse engineering of CAN bus traffic is at least partially possible by applying machine learning techniques and the performance of the classifiers increases when adding additional features to the analysis.},

@inproceedings{PeseSCNCS19,
	abstract = {Modern Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are equipped with an increasing number of Electronic Control Units (ECUs), many of which produce large amounts of data. Data is exchanged between ECUs via an in-vehicle network, with the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus being the de facto standard in contemporary vehicles. Furthermore, CAVs have not only physical interfaces but also increased data connectivity to the Internet via their Telematic Control Units (TCUs), enabling remote access via mobile devices. It is also possible to tap into, and read/write data from/to the CAN bus, as data transmitted on the CAN bus is not encrypted. This naturally generates concerns about automotive cybersecurity. One commonality among most vehicular security attacks reported to date is that they ultimately require write access to the CAN bus. In order to cause targeted and intentional changes in vehicle behavior, malicious CAN injection attacks require knowledge of the {CAN} message format. However, since this format is proprietary to OEMs and can differ even among different models of a single make of vehicle, one must manually reverse-engineer the CAN message format of each vehicle they target --- a time-consuming and tedious process that does not scale. To mitigate this difficulty, we develop LibreCAN, which can translate most CAN messages with minimal effort. Our extensive evaluation on multiple vehicles demonstrates LibreCAN's efficiency in terms of accuracy, coverage, required manual effort and scalability to any vehicle.},

abstract = {With the development of autonomous vehicle technology, the controller area network (CAN) bus has become the de facto standard for an in-vehicle communication system because of its simplicity and efficiency. However, without any encryption and authentication mechanisms, the in-vehicle network using the CAN protocol is susceptible to a wide range of attacks. Many studies, which are mostly based on machine learning, have proposed installing an intrusion detection system (IDS) for anomaly detection in the CAN bus system. Although machine learning methods have many advantages for IDS, previous models usually require a large amount of labeled data, which results in high time and labor costs. To handle this problem, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning-based convolutional adversarial autoencoder model in this paper. The proposed model combines two popular deep learning models: autoencoder and generative adversarial networks. First, the model is trained with unlabeled data to learn the manifolds of normal and attack patterns. Then, only a small number of labeled samples are used in supervised training. The proposed model can detect various kinds of message injection attacks, such as DoS, fuzzy, and spoofing, as well as unknown attacks. The experimental results show that the proposed model achieves the highest F1 score of 0.9984 and a low error rate of 0.1% with limited labeled data compared to other supervised methods. In addition, we show that the model can meet the real-time requirement by analyzing the model complexity in terms of the number of trainable parameters and inference time. This study successfully reduced the number of model parameters by five times and the inference time by eight times, compared to a state-of-the-art model.}

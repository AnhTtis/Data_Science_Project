    "abstract": "Quantum technologies have matured to the point that we can test fundamental quantum phenomena under extreme conditions. Specifically, entanglement, a cornerstone of modern quantum information theory, can be robustly produced and verified in various adverse environments. We take these tests further and implement a high-quality Bell experiment during a parabolic flight, transitioning from microgravity to hypergravity of 1.8 g while continuously observing Bell violation, with Bell-CHSH parameters between $S=-2.6202$ and $-2.7323$, an average of $\\overline{S} = -2.680$, and average standard deviation of $\\overline{ΔS} = 0.014$. This violation is unaffected both by uniform and non-uniform acceleration. This experiment both demonstrates the stability of current quantum communication platforms for space-based applications and adds an important reference point for testing the interplay of non-inertial motion and quantum information.",

In very high AO correction regimes, residual speckles are pinned on the diffraction rings of the Airy pattern. We show that this effect is due to small errors in the complex wave in the focal plane, amplified by the coherent part of the wave. The statistics of these speckles are fairly well described by a modified Rician distribution. The variance of the speckles, at high flux and at photon-counting levels, finds simple expressions. The total variance can be partitioned into two contributions: one that can be suppressed by a coronagraph and one that cannot. Different regimes can be identified. These results enable us to analyze when a coronagraph can defeat the noise variance, and they provide a criterion for the effectiveness of such instruments.},

Recent advances in adaptive optics and imaging technology at visible and infrared wavelengths have opened the door to direct detections of planetary companions to nearby stars, but image processing techniques have yet to be optimized. We show that the performance of our approach gives a marked improvement over what is presently possible using existing methods such as loci. To test our approach, we use real angular differential imaging (ADI) data taken with the adaptive optics-assisted high resolution near-infrared camera NACO at the VLT. These data were taken during the commissioning of the apodizing phase plate (APP) coronagraph. By inserting simulated planets into these data, we test the performance of our method as a function of planet brightness for different positions on the image. We find that in all cases pynpoint has a detection threshold that is superior to that given by our loci analysis when assessed in a common statistical framework. We obtain our best improvements for smaller inner working angles (IWAs). For an IWA of {$\sim$}0.29 arcsec we find that we achieve a detection sensitivity that is a factor of 5 better than loci. We also investigate our ability to correctly measure the flux of planets. Again, we find improvements over loci, with pynpoint giving more stable results. Finally, we apply our package to a non-APP data set of the exoplanet {$\beta$} Pictoris b and reveal the planet with high signal-to-noise. This confirms that pynpoint can potentially be applied with high fidelity to a wide range of high-contrast imaging data sets.},

  abstract = {Direct imaging is a powerful exoplanet discovery technique that is complementary to other techniques and offers great promise in the era of 30 meter class telescopes. Space-based transit surveys have revolutionized our understanding of the frequency of planets at small orbital radii around Sun-like stars. The next generation of extremely large ground-based telescopes will have the angular resolution and sensitivity to directly image planets with \$R {$<$} 4R\_\textbackslash oplus\$ around the very nearest stars. Here, we predict yields from a direct imaging survey of a volume-limited sample of Sun-like stars with the Mid-Infrared ELT Imager and Spectrograph (METIS) instrument, planned for the 39 m European Southern Observatory (ESO) Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) that is expected to be operational towards the end of the decade. Using Kepler occurrence rates, a sample of stars with spectral types A-K within 6.5 pc, and simulated contrast curves based on an advanced model of what is achievable from coronagraphic imaging with adaptive optics, we estimated the expected yield from METIS using Monte Carlo simulations. We find the METIS expected yield of planets in the N2 band (10.10 - 12.40 \$\textbackslash mu\$m) is 1.14 planets, which is greater than comparable observations in the L (3.70 - 3.95 \$\textbackslash mu\$m) and M (4.70 - 4.90 \$\textbackslash mu\$m) bands. We also determined a 24.6\% chance of detecting at least one Jovian planet in the background limited regime assuming a 1 hour integration. We calculated the yield per star and estimate optimal observing revisit times to increase the yield. We also analyzed a northern hemisphere version of this survey and found there are additional targets worth considering. In conclusion, we present an observing strategy aimed to maximize the possible yield for limited telescope time, resulting in 1.48 expected planets in the N2 band.},

To assess the performance of the method, we applied ANDROMEDA on VLT/NaCo data of TYC-8979-1683-1 which is surrounded by numerous bright stars and on which we added synthetic planets of known position and flux in the field. In order to accommodate the real data properties, it was necessary to develop additional pre-processing and post-processing steps to the initially proposed algorithm. We then investigated its skill in the challenging case of a well-known target, {$\beta$} Pictoris, whose companion is close to the detection limit and we compared our results to those obtained by another method based on principal component analysis (PCA). Results. Application on VLT/NaCo data demonstrates the ability of ANDROMEDA to automatically detect and characterize point sources present in the image field. We end up with a robust method bringing consistent results with a sensitivity similar to the recently published algorithms, with only two parameters to be fine tuned. Moreover, the companion flux estimates are not biased by the algorithm parameters and do not require a posteriori corrections. Conclusions. ANDROMEDA is an attractive alternative to current standard image processing methods that can be readily applied to on-sky data.},

Linking astronomy to the world of modern statistics, this volume is a unique resource, introducing astronomers to advanced statistics through ready-to-use code in the public domain R statistical software environment. The book presents fundamental results of probability theory and statistical inference, before exploring several fields of applied statistics, such as data smoothing, regression, multivariate analysis and classification, treatment of nondetections, time series analysis, and spatial point processes. It applies the methods discussed to contemporary astronomical research datasets using the R statistical software, making it invaluable for graduate students and researchers facing complex data analysis tasks.

  abstract = {Imaging observations are generally affected by a fluctuating background of speckles, a particular problem when detecting faint stellar companions at small angular separations. These speckles can be created by both short-lived atmospheric aberrations and slowly changing distortions in the optical system. Over the course of a long-exposure image, the combination of many independent realizations of speckle patterns forms a halo in the point-spread function (PSF) of characteristic scale {$\Delta\theta$} {$\lambda$}/r0 (where r0 is the coherence length in the pupil). While adaptive optics can increase the achievable image contrast, speckle noise remains a major source of random error, which decreases the sensitivity of companion detection observations near the diffraction limit. Knowing the distribution of the speckle intensities at a given location in the image plane is therefore important for understanding the noise limits of companion detection. The speckle noise limit in a long-exposure image is characterized by the intensity variance and the speckle lifetime. In this paper we address the former quantity through the distribution function of speckle intensity. Previous theoretical work has predicted a form for this distribution function at a single location in the image plane. We developed a fast readout mode to take short exposures of stellar images corrected by adaptive optics at the ground-based UCO/Lick Observatory, with integration times of 5 ms and a time between successive frames of 14.5 ms ({$\lambda$} = 2.2 {$\mu$}m). These observations temporally oversample and spatially Nyquist sample the observed speckle patterns. We show, for various locations in the image plane, that the observed distribution of speckle intensities is consistent with the predicted form. In addition, we demonstrate a method by which Ic and Is can be mapped over the image plane. As the quantity Ic is proportional to the PSF of the telescope free of random atmospheric aberrations, this method can be used for PSF calibration and reconstruction.},

  abstract = {\emph{Context{$<$}i/{$>$}. The detection of exoplanets by direct imaging is an active research topic in astronomy. Even with the coupling of an extreme adaptive-optics system with a coronagraph, it remains challenging due to the very high contrast between the host star and the exoplanets.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} The purpose of this paper is to describe a method, named PACO, dedicated to source detection from angular differential imaging data. Given the complexity of the fluctuations of the background in the datasets, involving spatially variant correlations, we aim to show the potential of a processing method that learns the statistical model of the background from the data.\emph{Methods{$<$}i/{$>$}. In contrast to existing approaches, the proposed method accounts for spatial correlations in the data. Those correlations and the average stellar speckles are learned locally and jointly to estimate the flux of the (potential) exoplanets. By preventing from subtracting images including the stellar speckles residuals, the photometry is intrinsically preserved. A nonstationary multi-variate Gaussian model of the background is learned. The decision in favor of the presence or the absence of an exoplanet is performed by a binary hypothesis test.\emph{Results{$<$}i/{$>$}. The statistical accuracy of the model is assessed using VLT/SPHERE-IRDIS datasets. It is shown to capture the nonstationarity in the data so that a unique threshold can be applied to the detection maps to obtain consistent detection performance at all angular separations. This statistical model makes it possible to directly assess the false alarm rate, probability of detection, photometric and astrometric accuracies without resorting to Monte-Carlo methods.\emph{Conclusions{$<$}i/{$>$}. PACO offers appealing characteristics: it is parameter-free and photometrically unbiased. The statistical performance in terms of detection capability, photometric and astrometric accuracies can be straightforwardly assessed. A fast approximate version of the method is also described that can be used to process large amounts of data from exoplanets search surveys.}}}}}},

Our algorithm is based on a modified version of half-sibling regression (HSR), a flexible denoising framework that combines ideas from the fields of machine learning and causality. We adapt the method to address the specific requirements of high-contrast exoplanet imaging data obtained in pupil tracking mode. The key idea is to estimate the systematic noise in a pixel by regressing the time series of this pixel onto a set of causally independent, signal-free predictor pixels. We use regularized linear models in this work; however, other (non-linear) models are also possible. In a second step, we demonstrate how the HSR framework allows us to incorporate observing conditions such as wind speed or air temperature as additional predictors. Results. When we apply our method to four data sets from the VLT/NACO instrument, our algorithm provides a better false-positive fraction than PCA-based PSF subtraction, a popular baseline method in the field. Additionally, we find that the HSR-based method provides direct and accurate estimates for the contrast of the exoplanets without the need to insert artificial companions for calibration in the data sets. Finally, we present first evidence that using the observing conditions as additional predictors can improve the results. Conclusions. Our HSR-based method provides an alternative, flexible and promising approach to the challenge of modeling and subtracting the stellar PSF and systematic noise in exoplanet imaging data.},

To this end we implement a metric meant to replace the empirical frequentist-based thresholds for detection. Our method, implemented within a Bayesian framework, introduces an ``evidence-based'' approach to help decide whether a given detection is a true planet or just noise. We apply this metric jointly with a postprocessing technique and Karhunen\textendash Loeve Image Processing (KLIP), which models and subtracts the stellar PSF from the image. As a proof of concept we implemented a new routine named               PlanetEvidence               that integrates the nested sampling technique (Multinest) with the KLIP algorithm. This is a first step to recast such a postprocessing method into a fully Bayesian perspective. We test our approach on real direct imaging data, specifically using GPI data of               {$\beta$}               Pictoris b, and on synthetic data. We find that for the former the method strongly favors the presence of a planet (as expected) and recovers the true parameter posterior distributions. For the latter case our approach allows us to detect (true) dim sources invisible to the naked eye as real planets, rather than background noise, and set a new lower threshold for detection at {$\sim$}2.5               {$\sigma$}               level. Further it allows us to quantify our confidence that a given detection is a real planet and not just residual noise.},

We propose a reformulation of the exoplanet detection task (for ADI sequences) that builds on well-established machine learning techniques to take HCI post-processing from an unsupervised to a supervised learning context. In this new framework, we present algorithmic solutions using two different discriminative models: SODIRF (random forests) and SODINN (neural networks). We test these algorithms on real ADI datasets from VLT/NACO and VLT/SPHERE HCI instruments. We then assess their performances by injecting fake companions and using receiver operating characteristic analysis. This is done in comparison with state-of-the-art ADI algorithms, such as ADI principal component analysis (ADI-PCA). Results. This study shows the improved sensitivity versus specificity trade-off of the proposed supervised detection approach. At the diffraction limit, SODINN improves the true positive rate by a factor ranging from {$\sim$}2 to {$\sim$}10 (depending on the dataset and angular separation) with respect to ADI-PCA when working at the same false-positive level. Conclusions. The proposed supervised detection framework outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in the task of discriminating planet signal from speckles. In addition, it offers the possibility of re-processing existing HCI databases to maximize their scientific return and potentially improve the demographics of directly imaged exoplanets.},

Its role is almost as important as the choice of a coronagraph or a wavefront control system, and it is intertwined with the chosen observing strategy. Among the data processing techniques for angular differential imaging (ADI), the most recent is the family of principal component analysis (PCA) based algorithms. It is a widely used statistical tool developed during the first half of the past century. PCA serves, in this case, as a subspace projection technique for constructing a reference point spread function (PSF) that can be subtracted from the science data for boosting the detectability of potential companions present in the data. Unfortunately, when building this reference PSF from the science data itself, PCA comes with certain limitations such as the sensitivity of the lower dimensional orthogonal subspace to non-Gaussian noise.\emph{Aims. {$<$}i/{$>$}Inspired by recent advances in machine learning algorithms such as robust PCA, we aim to propose a localized subspace projection technique that surpasses current PCA-based post-processing algorithms in terms of the detectability of companions at near real-time speed, a quality that will be useful for future direct imaging surveys.\emph{Methods. {$<$}i/{$>$}We used randomized low-rank approximation methods recently proposed in the machine learning literature, coupled with entry-wise thresholding to decompose an ADI image sequence locally into low-rank, sparse, and Gaussian noise components (LLSG).

VIP implements functionalities for building high-contrast data processing pipelines, encompassing pre- and post-processing algorithms, potential source position and flux estimation, and sensitivity curve generation. Among the reference point-spread function subtraction techniques for ADI post-processing, VIP includes several flavors of principal component analysis (PCA) based algorithms, such as annular PCA and incremental PCA algorithms capable of processing big datacubes (of several gigabytes) on a computer with limited memory. Also, we present a novel ADI algorithm based on non-negative matrix factorization, which comes from the same family of low-rank matrix approximations as PCA and provides fairly similar results. We showcase the ADI capabilities of the VIP library using a deep sequence on HR 8799 taken with the LBTI/LMIRCam and its recently commissioned L-band vortex coronagraph. Using VIP, we investigated the presence of additional companions around HR 8799 and did not find any significant additional point source beyond the four known planets.

Sums of speckle patterns are also considered, the addition being either on an amplitude or on an intensity basis, with partially polarized speckle being a special case. Next we consider the sum of a speckle pattern and a coherent background, deriving the first-order probability density functions of intensity and phase. Attention is then turned to second-order statistics. The autocorrelation function and power spectral density are derived, both for a free-space propagation geometry and for an imaging geometry. In some cases the recorded speckle pattern may be spatially integrated or blurred, and accordingly consideration is given to the statistics of such patterns.

  abstract = {The direct characterization of exoplanetary systems with high contrast imaging is among the highest priorities for the broader exoplanet community. As large space missions will be necessary for detecting and characterizing exo-Earth twins, developing the techniques and technology for direct imaging of exoplanets is a driving focus for the community. For the first time, JWST will directly observe extrasolar planets at mid-infrared wavelengths beyond 5 \textmu m, deliver detailed spectroscopy revealing much more precise chemical abundances and atmospheric conditions, and provide sensitivity to analogs of our solar system ice-giant planets at wide orbital separations, an entirely new class of exoplanet. However, in order to maximise the scientific output over the lifetime of the mission, an exquisite understanding of the instrumental performance of JWST is needed as early in the mission as possible. In this paper, we describe our 54-hour Early Release Science Program that will utilize all four JWST instruments to extend the characterisation of planetary mass companions to {$\sim$}15 \textmu m as well as image a circumstellar disk in the mid-infrared with unprecedented sensitivity. Our program will also assess the performance of the observatory in the key modes expected to be commonly used for exoplanet direct imaging and spectroscopy, optimize data calibration and processing, and generate representative datasets that will enable a broad user base to effectively plan for general observing programs in future Cycles.},

Current instruments employing the combination of adaptive optics (AO) and coronagraphy can typically detect objects within 2'' of the star that are 104-105 times fainter. Correlated speckle noise is one of the biggest obstacles limiting such high-contrast imaging. We have obtained a series of 284 8 s, AO-corrected, coronagraphically occulted H-band images of the star Vega at the 3.63 m AEOS telescope located on Haleakala, Hawaii. This data set is unique for studying the temporal behavior of speckle noise and represents the first time such a study on highly corrected coronagraphic AO images has been carried out in a quantitative way. We find the speckle pattern to be highly stable in both position and time in our data. This is due to the fact that the AO system corrects disturbances to the stellar wave front at the level where the instrumental wave front errors dominate. Because of this, we find that our detection limit is not significantly improved simply with increased exposure time alone. However, we are able to improve our dynamic range by 1.5-2 mag through subtraction of static/quasi-static speckles in two rotating frames: the telescope pupil frame and the deformable mirror frame. The highly stable nature of speckles will exist for any program using coronagraphy and high-order AO. Furthermore, from our data, we are able to constrain the mass of any purported companion to Vega to be less than 45MJ at 8 AU and less than 30MJ at 16 AU, radii not previously probed at these sensitivities.},

In this paper, we argue that the current industry standard for such comparisons\textemdash the contrast curve\textemdash falls short of this mandate. We propose a new figure of merit, the ``performance map,'' that incorporates three fundamental concepts in signal detection theory: the true positive fraction, the false positive fraction, and the detection threshold. By supplying a theoretical basis and recipe for generating the performance map, we hope to encourage the widespread adoption of this new metric across subfields in exoplanet imaging.},

While the initial detection occurred in 2007, two of the planets were recovered in a reanalysis of data obtained in 2004. Here we present a detection of the furthest planet of that system, HR 8799 b, in archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) data from 1998. The detection was made using the locally optimized combination of images algorithm to construct, from a large set of HST/NICMOS images of different stars taken from the archive, an optimized reference point-spread function image used to subtract the light of the primary star from the images of HR 8799. This new approach improves the sensitivity to planets at small separations by a factor of {$\sim$}10 compared to traditional roll deconvolution. The new detection provides an astrometry point 10 years before the most recent observations, and is consistent with a Keplerian circular orbit with a{$\sim$} 70 AU and low orbital inclination. The new photometry point, in the F160W filter, is in good agreement with an atmosphere model with intermediate clouds and vertical stratification, and thus suggests the presence of significant water absorption in the planet's atmosphere. The success of the new approach used here highlights a path for the search and characterization of exoplanets with future space telescopes, such as the James Webb Space Telescope or a Terrestrial Planet Finder.},

  abstract = {Methods. In this study, we present the observing and data analysis strategy, the ranking process of the detected candidates, and the survey performances for a subsample of 150 stars, which are representative of the full SHINE sample. The observations were conducted in an homogeneous way from February 2015 to February 2017 with the dedicated ground-based VLT/SPHERE instrument equipped with the IFS integral field spectrograph and the IRDIS dual-band imager covering a spectral range between 0.9 and 2.3 \textmu m. We used coronographic, angular and spectral differential imaging techniques to reach the best detection performances for this study down to the planetary mass regime. Results. We have processed in a uniform manner more than 300 SHINE observations and datasets to assess the survey typical sensitivity as a function of the host star, and of the observing conditions. The median detection performance reaches 5{$\sigma$}-contrasts of 13 mag at 200 mas and 14.2 mag at 800 mas with the IFS (YJ and YJH bands), and of 11.8 mag at 200 mas, 13.1 mag at 800 mas and 15.8 mag at 3 as with IRDIS in H band, delivering one of the deepest sensitivity surveys so far for young nearby stars. A total of sixteen substellar companions were imaged in this first part of SHINE: seven brown dwarf companions, and ten planetary-mass companions. They include the two new discoveries HIP 65426 b and HIP 64892 B, but not the planets around PDS70 not originally select in the SHINE core sample. A total of 1483 candidates were detected, mainly in the large field-of-view of IRDIS. Color-magnitude diagrams, low-resolution spectrum when available with IFS, and follow-up observations, enabled to identify the nature (background contaminant or comoving companion) of about 86 \% of them. The remaining cases are often connected to crowded field missing follow-up observations. Finally, although SHINE was not designed for disk searches, twelve circumstellar disks were imaged including three new detections around the HIP 73145, HIP 86598 and HD 106906 systems. Conclusions. Nowadays, direct imaging brings a unique opportunity to probe the outer part of exoplanetary systems beyond 10 au to explore planetary architectures as highlighted by the discoveries of one new exoplanet, one new brown dwarf companion, and three new debris disks during this early phase of SHINE. It also offers the opportunity to explore and revisit the physical and orbital properties of these young giant planets and brown dwarf companions (relative position, photometry and low-resolution spectrum in near-infrared, predicted masses, contrast to search for additional companions). Finally, these results highlight the importance to finalize the SHINE systematic observation of about 500 young, nearby stars, for a full exploration of their outer part to explore the demographics of young giant planets beyond 10 au, and to nail down the most interesting systems for the next generation of high-contrast imagers on very large and extremely large telescopes.},

  abstract = {Methods. We carry out a large L -band high-contrast direct imaging survey for giant planets around 200 young stars with protoplanetary or debris discs using the NACO instrument at the ESO Very Large Telescope on Cerro Paranal in Chile. We use very deep angular differential imaging observations with typically {$>$}60{$\smwhtcircle$} field rotation, and employ a vector vortex coronagraph where feasible to achieve the best possible point source sensitivity down to an inner working angle of about 100 mas. This paper introduces the NACO Imaging Survey for Planets around Young stars (NACO-ISPY), its goals and strategy, the target list, and data reduction scheme, and presents preliminary results from the first 2.5 survey years. Results. We achieve a mean 5 {$\sigma$} contrast of {$\increment$}L = 6.4 {$\pm$} 0.1 mag at 150 mas and a background limit of Lbg = 16.5 {$\pm$} 0.2 mag at {$>$}1. 5. Our detection probability is {$>$}50\% for companions with 8 MJup at semi-major axes of 80\textendash 200 au and {$>$}13 MJup at 30\textendash 250 au. It thus compares well to the detection space of other state-of-the-art high-contrast imaging surveys. We have already contributed to the characterisation of two new planets originally discovered by VLT/SPHERE, but we have not yet independently discovered new planets around any of our target stars. We have discovered two new close-in low-mass stellar companions around R CrA and HD 193571 and report in this paper the discovery of close co-moving low-mass stellar companions around HD 72660 and HD 92536. Furthermore, we report L -band scattered light images of the discs around eleven stars, six of which have never been imaged at L -band before. Conclusions. The first 2.5 yr of the NACO-ISPY survey have already demonstrated that VLT/NACO combined with our survey strategy can achieve the anticipated sensitivity to detect giant planets and reveal new close stellar companions around our target stars.},

  abstract = {Angular differential imaging is a high-contrast imaging technique that reduces quasistatic speckle noise and facilitates the detection of nearby companions. A sequence of images is acquired with an altitude/azimuth telescope while the instrument field derotator is switched off. This keeps the instrument and telescope optics aligned and allows the field of view to rotate with respect to the instrument. For each image, a reference point-spread function (PSF) is constructed from other appropriately selected images of the same sequence and subtracted to remove quasistatic PSF structure. All residual images are then rotated to align the field and are combined. Observed performances are reported for Gemini North data. It is shown that quasistatic PSF noise can be reduced by a factor 5 for each image subtraction. The combination of all residuals then provides an additional gain of the order of the square root of the total number of acquired images. A total speckle noise attenuation of 20-50 is obtained for a 1 hr long observing sequence compared to a single 30 s exposure. A PSF noise attenuation of 100 was achieved for a 2 hr long sequence of images of Vega, reaching a 5 {$\sigma$} contrast of 20 mag for separations greater than 8''. For a 30 minute long sequence, ADI achieves signal-to-noise ratios 30 times better than a classical observation technique. The ADI technique can be used with currently available instruments to search for 1MJup exoplanets with orbits of radii between 50 and 300 AU around nearby young stars. The possibility of combining the technique with other high-contrast imaging methods is briefly discussed.},

  abstract = {In long adaptive optics corrected exposures, exoplanet detections are currently limited by speckle noise originating from the telescope and instrument optics, and it is expected that such noise will also limit future high-contrast imaging instruments for both ground- and space-based telescopes. Previous theoretical analyses have shown that the time intensity variations of a single speckle follow a modified Rician. It is first demonstrated here that for a circular pupil, this temporal intensity distribution also represents the speckle spatial intensity distribution at a fixed separation from the point-spread function center; this fact is demonstrated using numerical simulations for coronagraphic and noncoronagraphic data. The real statistical distribution of the noise needs to be taken into account explicitly when selecting a detection threshold appropriate for some desired confidence level (CL). In this paper, a technique is described to obtain the pixel intensity distribution of an image and its corresponding CL as a function of the detection threshold. Using numerical simulations, it is shown that in the presence of speckle noise, a detection threshold up to 3 times higher is required to obtain a CL equivalent to that at 5   for Gaussian noise. The technique is then tested on data acquired by simultaneous spectral differential imaging with TRIDENT and by angular differential imaging with NIRI. It is found that the angular differential imaging technique produces quasi-Gaussian residuals, a remarkable result compared to classical adaptive optic imaging. Finally, a power law is derived to predict the 1 \`A 3 ; 10\`A7 CL detection threshold when averaging a partially correlated non-Gaussian noise.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we review the impact of small sample statistics on detection thresholds and corresponding confidence levels (CLs) in high-contrast imaging at small angles. When looking close to the star, the number of resolution elements decreases rapidly toward small angles. This reduction of the number of degrees of freedom dramatically affects CLs and false alarm probabilities. Naively using the same ideal hypothesis and methods as for larger separations, which are well understood and commonly assume Gaussian noise, can yield up to one order of magnitude error in contrast estimations at fixed CL. The statistical penalty exponentially increases toward very small inner working angles. Even at 5\textendash 10 resolution elements from the star, false alarm probabilities can be significantly higher than expected. Here we present a rigorous statistical analysis that ensures robustness of the CL, but also imposes a substantial limitation on corresponding achievable detection limits (thus contrast) at small angles. This unavoidable fundamental statistical effect has a significant impact on current coronagraphic and future high-contrast imagers. Finally, the paper concludes with practical recommendations to account for small number statistics when computing the sensitivity to companions at small angles and when exploiting the results of direct imaging planet surveys.},

A quintessential example is the massive extrasolar planet {$\beta$} Pic b, which is 9 AU from and embedded in the debris disk of the young nearby A6V star {$\beta$} Pictoris. We observed the system with first light of the Magellan Adaptive Optics (MagAO) system. In Paper I we presented the first CCD detection of this planet with MagAO+VisAO. Here we present four MagAO+Clio images of {$\beta$} Pic b at 3.1 {$\mu$}m, 3.3 {$\mu$}m, L{${'}$}, and including the first observation in the fundamental CH4 band. To remove systematic errors from the spectral energy distribution (SED), we re-calibrate the literature photometry and combine it with our own data, for a total of 22 independent measurements at 16 passbands from 0.99 to 4.8 {$\mu$}m. Atmosphere models demonstrate the planet is cloudy but are degenerate in effective temperature and radius. The measured SED now covers {$>$}80\% of the planet's energy, so we approach the bolometric luminosity empirically. We calculate the luminosity by extending the measured SED with a blackbody and integrating to find log(/) From our bolometric luminosity and an age of 23 {$\pm$} 3 Myr, hot-start evolutionary tracks give a mass of 12.7 {$\pm$} 0.3 , radius of 1.45 {$\pm$} 0.02 , and Teff of 1708 {$\pm$} 23 K (model-dependent errors not included). Our empirically determined luminosity is in agreement with values from atmospheric models (typically dex), but brighter than values from the field-dwarf bolometric correction (typically dex), illustrating the limitations in comparing young exoplanets to old brown dwarfs.},

  abstract = {Direct imaging of exoplanets is a challenging task as it requires to reach a high contrast at very close separation to the star. Today, the main limitation in the high-contrast images is the quasi-static speckles that are created by residual instrumental aberrations. They have the same angular size as planetary companions and are often brighter, hence hindering our capability to detect exoplanets. Dedicated observation strategies and signal processing techniques are necessary to disentangle these speckles from planetary signals. The output of these methods is a detection map in which the value of each pixel is related to a probability of presence of a planetary signal. The detection map found in the literature relies on the assumption that the residual noise is Gaussian. However, this is known to lead to higher false positive rates, especially close to the star. In this paper, we re-visit the notion of detection map by analysing the speckle noise distribution, namely the Modified Rician distribution. We use non-asymptotic analysis of the sum of random variables to show that the tail of the distribution of the residual noise decays as an exponential distribution, hence explaining the high false detection rate obtained with the Gaussian assumption. From this analysis, we introduce a novel time domain detection map and we demonstrate its capabilities and the relevance of our approach through experiments on real data. We also provide an empirical rule to determine detection threshold providing a good trade-off between true positive and false positive rates for exoplanet detection.},

  abstract = {We describe the symmetries present in the point-spread function (PSF) of an optical system either located in space or corrected by an adaptive optics (AO) system to Strehl ratios of about 70\% and higher. We present a formalism for expanding the PSF to arbitrary order in terms of powers of the Fourier transform of the residual phase error over an arbitrarily shaped and apodized entrance aperture. For traditional unapodized apertures at high Strehl ratios, bright speckles pinned to the bright Airy rings are part of an antisymmetric perturbation of the perfect PSF, arising from the term that is first order in the residual phase error. There are two symmetric second-degree terms. One is negative at the center and, like the first-order term, is modulated by the perfect image's field strength\textemdash it reduces to the Mar\'echal approximation at the center of the PSF. The other is nonnegative everywhere, zero at the image center, and can be responsible for an extended halo\textemdash which limits the dynamic range of faint companion detection in the darkest portions of the image. In regimes where one or the other term dominates the speckles in an image, the symmetry of the dominant term can be exploited to reduce the effect of those speckles, potentially by an order of magnitude or more. We demonstrate the effects of both secondary obscuration and pupil apodization on the structure of residual speckles and discuss how these symmetries can be exploited by appropriate telescope and instrument design, observing strategies, and filter bandwidths to improve the dynamic range of high dynamic range AO and space-based observations. Finally, we show that our analysis is relevant to high dynamic range coronagraphy.},

Under the assumptions made in our modelling, in particular on the achievable inner working angle and sensitivity, our analyses reveal that within a reasonable amount of observing time METIS is able to image {$>$}20 already known, RV-detected planets in at least one filter. Many more suitable planets with dynamically determined masses are expected to be found in the coming years with the continuation of RV-surveys and the results from the GAIA astrometry mission. In addition, by extrapolating the statistics for close-in planets found by Kepler, we expect METIS might detect {$\approx$}10 small planets with equilibrium temperatures between 200 and 500~K around the nearest stars. This means that (1) METIS will help constrain atmospheric models for gas giant planets by determining for a sizable sample their luminosity, temperature and orbital inclination; and (2) METIS might be the first instrument to image a nearby (super-) Earth-sized planet with an equilibrium temperature near that expected to enable liquid water on a planet surface.},

  abstract = {One of the long-term goals of exoplanet science is the atmospheric characterization of dozens of small exoplanets in order to understand their diversity and search for habitable worlds and potential biosignatures. Achieving this goal requires a space mission of sufficient scale. We seek to quantify the exoplanet detection performance of a space-based mid-infrared nulling interferometer that measures the thermal emission of exoplanets. For this, we have developed an instrument simulator that considers all major astrophysical noise sources and coupled it with Monte Carlo simulations of a synthetic exoplanet population around main-sequence stars within 20 pc. This allows us to quantify the number (and types) of exoplanets that our mission concept could detect over a certain time period. Two different scenarios to distribute the observing time among the stellar targets are discussed and different apertures sizes and wavelength ranges are considered. Within a 2.5-year initial search phase, an interferometer consisting of four 2 m apertures with a total instrument throughput of 5\% covering a wavelength range between 4 and 18.5 \$\textbackslash mu\$m could detect up to \textasciitilde 550 exoplanets with radii between 0.5 and 6 R\$\_\textbackslash oplus\$ with an integrated SNR\$\textbackslash ge\$7. At least \textasciitilde 160 of the detected exoplanets have radii \$\textbackslash le\$1.5 R\$\_\textbackslash oplus\$. Depending on the observing scenario, \textasciitilde 25-45 rocky exoplanets (objects with radii between 0.5 and 1.5 \$\_\{\textbackslash oplus\}\$) orbiting within the empirical habitable zone (eHZ) of their host stars are among the detections. With an aperture size of 3.5 m, the total number of detections can increase to up to \textasciitilde 770, including \textasciitilde 60-80 rocky, eHZ planets. With 1 m aperture size, the maximum detection yield is \textasciitilde 315 exoplanets, including \$\textbackslash le\$20 rocky, eHZ planets. In terms of predicted detection yield, such a mission can compete with large single-aperture reflected light missions. (abridged)},

We resolve the disk in polarized light in the H and Ks filter between {$\sim$}0.{${''}$}1 and 1.{${''}$}4 (i.e., {$\sim$}10\textendash 140 AU). The innermost disk regions are directly imaged for the first time and the mean apparent disk inclination and position angle are derived. The surface brightness along the disk major axis drops off roughly with S(r){$\propto$}r-3 but has a maximum around 0.{${''}$}15 suggesting a marginal detection of the main disk inner rim at {$\sim$}15 AU. We find a significant brightness asymmetry along the disk minor axis in both filters with the far side of the disk appearing brighter than the near side. This enhanced backward scattering and a low total polarization degree of the scattered disk flux of 14+19 - 8\% suggest that the dust grains on the disk surface are larger than typical interstellar medium grains. Empirical scattering functions reveal the backward scattering peak at the largest scattering angles and a second maximum for the smallest scattering angles. This indicates a second dust grain population preferably forward scattering and smaller in size. It shows that, relatively, in the inner disk regions (40\textendash 50 AU) a higher fraction of larger grains is found compared to the outer disk regions (100\textendash 110 AU). Finally, our images reveal distinct substructures between 25 and 35 AU physical separation from the star and we discuss the possible origin for the two features in the context of ongoing planet formation.},

The effect is orders of magnitude greater than conventional photon noise. It depends on the dwell time of the speckle pattern, the brightness of the star, and the fraction (1 - S) of residual light in the halo (S being the Strehl ratio of the image). These predictions agree well with limits found using the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope adaptive optics bonnette. The limiting brightness for detection is proportional to (1 - S)/S, emphasizing the need for large Strehl ratios. Strategies to reduce speckle noise are proposed; the encouraging results of a test are presented.},

Our first epoch clearly revealed the source at {$\simeq$} 10{$\sigma$}, while our second epoch lacks good observing conditions, yielding a {$\simeq$} 3{$\sigma$} detection. Various tests were thus made to rule out possible artifacts. This recovery is consistent with the signal at the first epoch but requires cleaner confirmation. Nevertheless, our astrometric precision suggests that the companion is comoving with the star with a 3{$\sigma$} confidence level. The planetary nature of the source is reinforced by a non-detection in the Ks-band (2.18 {$\mu$}m) images according to its possible extremely red Ks\textendash L{${'}$} color. Conversely, background contamination is rejected with good confidence level. The luminosity yields a predicted mass of about 4\textendash 5 MJup (at 10\textendash 17 Myr) using ``hot-start'' evolutionary models, making HD 95086 b the exoplanet with the lowest mass ever imaged around a star.},

  abstract = {Background: Student's two-sample t test is generally used for comparing the means of two independent samples, for example, two treatment arms. Under the null hypothesis, the t test assumes that the two samples arise from the same normally distributed population with unknown variance. Adequate control of the Type I error requires that the normality assumption holds, which is often examined by means of a preliminary Shapiro-Wilk test. The following two-stage procedure is widely accepted: If the preliminary test for normality is not significant, the t test is used; if the preliminary test rejects the null hypothesis of normality, a nonparametric test is applied in the main analysis. Methods: Equally sized samples were drawn from exponential, uniform, and normal distributions. The two-sample t test was conducted if either both samples (Strategy I) or the collapsed set of residuals from both samples (Strategy II) had passed the preliminary Shapiro-Wilk test for normality; otherwise, Mann-Whitney's U test was conducted. By simulation, we separately estimated the conditional Type I error probabilities for the parametric and nonparametric part of the two-stage procedure. Finally, we assessed the overall Type I error rate and the power of the two-stage procedure as a whole. Results: Preliminary testing for normality seriously altered the conditional Type I error rates of the subsequent main analysis for both parametric and nonparametric tests. We discuss possible explanations for the observed results, the most important one being the selection mechanism due to the preliminary test. Interestingly, the overall Type I error rate and power of the entire two-stage procedure remained within acceptable limits. Conclusion: The two-stage procedure might be considered incorrect from a formal perspective; nevertheless, in the investigated examples, this procedure seemed to satisfactorily maintain the nominal significance level and had acceptable power properties.},

We performed long-exposure thermal infrared coronagraphic imaging observations to search for accreting planets, especially within dust gaps previously detected in scattered light and submillimeterwave thermal emission. Three nights of observations with the Keck/NIRC2 vortex coronagraph in L{${'}$} (3.4\textendash 4.1 {$\mu$}m) did not reveal any statistically significant point sources. We thereby set strict upper limits on the masses of nonaccreting planets. In the four most prominent disk gaps at 24, 41, 47, and 88 au, we obtain upper mass limits of 1.6\textendash 2.3, 1.1\textendash 1.6, 1.1\textendash 1.5, and 1.0\textendash 1.2 Jupiter masses(MJ), assuming an age range of 7\textendash 10Myr for TW Hya. These limits correspond to the contrast at 95\% completeness (true positive fraction of 0.95) with a 1\% chance of a false positive within 1{${''}$} of the star. We also approximate an upper limit on the product of the planet mass and planetary accretion rate of Mp M\textperiodcentered{}  10-8 MJ2 yr-1 implying that any putative {$\sim$}0.1 MJ planet, which could be responsible for opening the 24 au gap, is presently accreting at rates insufficient to build up a Jupiter mass within TW Hya's pre-main-sequence lifetime.},

Using example observations taken with the vortex coronagraph mode of Keck/NIRC2 in L{${'}$} band, we demonstrate that RDI provides improved sensitivity to point sources at small angular separations compared to angular differential imaging (ADI). Applying RDI to images of the low-mass stellar companions HIP79124C (192 mas separation, {$\Delta$}L{${'}$}=4.01) and HIP78233B (141 mas separation, {$\Delta$}L{${'}$}=4.78), the latter a first imaging detection, increases the significance of their detections by up to a factor of 5 with respect to ADI. We compare methods for reference frame selection and find that pre-selection of frames improves detection significance of point sources by up to a factor of 3. In addition, we use observations of the circumstellar disks around MWC758 and 2MASSJ16042165-2130284 to show that RDI allows for accurate mapping of scattered light distributions without self-subtraction artifacts.},

  abstract = {Rigorously quantifying the information in high contrast imaging data is important for informing follow-up strategies to confirm the substellar nature of a point source, constraining theoretical models of planet-disk interactions, and deriving planet occurrence rates. However, within the exoplanet direct imaging community, non-detections have almost exclusively been defined using a frequentist detection threshold (i.e. contrast curve) and associated completeness. This can lead to conceptual inconsistencies when included in a Bayesian framework. A Bayesian upper limit is such that the true value of a parameter lies below this limit with a certain probability. The associated probability is the integral of the posterior distribution with the upper limit as the upper bound. In summary, a frequentist upper limit is a statement about the detectability of planets while a Bayesian upper limit is a statement about the probability of a parameter to lie in an interval given the data. The latter is therefore better suited for rejecting hypotheses or theoretical models based on their predictions. In this work we emphasize that Bayesian statistics and upper limits are more easily interpreted and typically more constraining than the frequentist approach. We illustrate the use of Bayesian analysis in two different cases: 1) with a known planet location where we also propose to use model comparison to constrain the astrophysical nature of the point source and 2) gap-carving planets in TW Hya. To finish, we also mention the problem of combining radial velocity and direct imaging observations.},

  abstract = {We present a new matched-filter algorithm for direct detection of point sources in the immediate vicinity of bright stars. The stellar point-spread function (PSF) is first subtracted using a Karhunen-Lo\'eve image processing (KLIP) algorithm with angular and spectral differential imaging (ADI and SDI). The KLIP-induced distortion of the astrophysical signal is included in the matched-filter template by computing a forward model of the PSF at every position in the image. To optimize the performance of the algorithm, we conduct extensive planet injection and recovery tests and tune the exoplanet spectra template and KLIP reduction aggressiveness to maximize the signalto-noise ratio (S/N) of the recovered planets. We show that only two spectral templates are necessary to recover any young Jovian exoplanets with minimal S/N loss. We also developed a complete pipeline for the automated detection of point-source candidates, the calculation of receiver operating characteristics (ROC), contrast curves based onfalse positives, and completeness contours. We process in a uniform manner more than 330 data sets from the Gemini Planet Imager Exoplanet Survey and assess GPI typical sensitivity as a function of the star and the hypothetical companion spectral type. This work allows for the first time a comparison of different detection algorithms at a survey scale accounting for both planet completeness and false-positive rate. We show that the new forward model matched filter allows the detection of 50\% fainter objects than a conventional cross-correlation technique with a Gaussian PSF template for the same false-positive rate.},

Thus, it is of paramount importance to push towards detections at smaller separations, which is the part of the parameter space containing the greatest number of planets. The performance of traditional methods for the post-processing of pupil-stabilized observations decreases at smaller separations due to the larger field-rotation required to displace a source on the detector in addition to the intrinsic difficulty of higher stellar contamination.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} Our goal is to develop a method of extracting exoplanet signals, which improves performance at small angular separations.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} A data-driven model of the temporal behavior of the systematics for each pixel can be created using reference pixels at a different positions, on the condition that the underlying causes of the systematics are shared across multiple pixels, which is mostly true for the speckle pattern in high-contrast imaging. In our causal regression model, we simultaneously fit the model of a planet signal ``transiting'' over detector pixels and non-local reference light curves describing the shared temporal trends of the speckle pattern to find the best-fitting temporal model describing the signal.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} With our implementation of a spatially non-local, temporal systematics model, called TRAP, we show that it is possible to gain up to a factor of six in contrast at close separations ({$<$}3\emph{{$\lambda<$}i/{$>$}/\emph{D{$<$}i/{$>$}), as compared to a model based on spatial correlations between images displaced in time. We show that the temporal sampling has a large impact on the achievable contrast, with better temporal sampling resulting in significantly better contrasts. At short integration times, (4 s) for \emph{{$\beta<$}i/{$>$} Pic data, we increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the planet by a factor of four compared to the spatial systematics model. Finally, we show that the temporal model can be used on unaligned data that has only been dark- and flat-corrected, without the need for further pre-processing.}}}}}}}},

Orbital motion provides insight into the stability and possible formation mechanisms of this planetary system. Dynamical studies can also provide constraints on the planets' masses, which help calibrate evolutionary models, yet measuring the orbital motion is a very difficult task because the long-period orbits (50\textendash 500 yr) require long time baselines and high-precision astrometry. This paper studies the three planets HR 8799b, c, and d in the archival data set of HR 8799 obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) NICMOS coronagraph in 1998. The detection of all three planets is made possible by a careful optimization of the Locally Optimized Combination of Images algorithm, and we used a statistical analysis of a large number of reduced images. This work confirms previous astrometry for planet b and presents new detections and astrometry for planets c and d. These HST images provide a ten-year baseline with the discovery images from 2008, and therefore offer a unique opportunity to constrain their orbital motion now. Recent dynamical studies of this system show the existence of a few possible stable solutions involving mean motion resonances (MMRs), where the interaction between c and d plays a major role. We study the compatibility of a few of these stable scenarios (1d:1c, 1d:2c, or 1d:2c:4d) with the new astrometric data from HST. In the hypothesis of a 1d:2c:4b MMR our best orbit fit is close to the stable solution previously identified for a three-planet system and involves low eccentricity for planet d (ed = 0.10) and moderate inclination of the system (i = 28.0 deg), assuming a coplanar system, circular orbits for b and c, and exact resonance with integer period ratios. Under these assumptions, we can place strong constraints on the inclination of the system (27.3\textendash 31.4 deg) and on the eccentricity for d ed {$<$} 0.46. Our results are robust to small departures from exact integer period ratios and consistent with previously published results based on dynamical studies for a three-planet system prior to the discovery of the fourth planet.},

The results provide insight into the effects on the dynamic range of wave front control, coronagraphy, active speckle reduction, and differential speckle calibration.

For the idealized case where the spectrum of the star is well known and unchanging across the field, we discuss the utility of cross-correlation to seek the extrasolar planet signal and describe a mathematical approach to completely eliminate stray light from the host star (although not its Poisson noise). For the case where the point-spread function (PSF) is dominated by diffraction and scattering effects and comprises a multitude of speckles within an Airy pattern, typical of a space-based observation, we turn the wavelength dependence of the PSF to advantage and present a general way to eliminate the contribution from the star while preserving both the flux and spectrum of the extrasolar planet. We call this method "spectral deconvolution." We illustrate the dramatic gains by showing an idealized simulation that results in a 20 {$\sigma$} detection of a Jovian planet at 2 pc with a 2 m coronagraphic space telescope, even though the planet's peak flux is only 1\% that of the PSF wings of the host star. This scales to detection of a terrestrial extrasolar planet at 2 pc with an 8 m coronagraphic Terrestrial Planet Finder in 7 hr (or less with appropriate spatial filtering). Data on the spectral characteristics of the extrasolar planet and hence on its atmospheric constituents and possible biomarkers are naturally obtained as part of this process.},

  abstract = {Direct imaging of exoplanets is usually limited by quasi-static speckles. These uncorrected aberrations in a star's point spread function (PSF) obscure faint companions and limit the sensitivity of high-contrast imaging instruments. Most current approaches to processing differential imaging sequences like angular differential imaging (ADI) and spectral differential imaging (SDI) produce a self-calibrating dataset that are combined in a linear least squares solution to minimize the noise. Due to temporal and chromatic evolution of a telescope's PSF, the best correlated reference images are usually the most contaminated by the planet, leading to self-subtraction and reducing the planet throughput. In this paper, we present an algorithm that directly optimizes the non-linear equation for planet signal to noise ratio (SNR). This new algorithm does not require us to reject adjacent reference images and optimally balances noise reduction with self-subtraction. We then show how this algorithm can be applied to multiple images simultaneously for a further reduction in correlated noise, directly maximizing the SNR of the final combined image. Finally, we demonstrate the technique on an illustrative sequence of HR8799 using the new Julia-based Signal to Noise Analysis Pipeline (SNAP). We show that SNR optimization can provide up to a 5\texttimes{} improvement in contrast close to the star. Applicable to both new and archival data, this technique will allow for the detection of fainter, lower mass, and closer in companions, or achieve the same sensitivity with less telescope time.},

  abstract = {The SpHere INfrared Exoplanet (SHINE) project is a 500-star survey performed with SPHERE on the Very Large Telescope for the purpose of directly detecting new substellar companions and understanding their formation and early evolution. Here we present an initial statistical analysis for a subsample of 150 stars spanning spectral types from B to M that are representative of the full SHINE sample. Our goal is to constrain the frequency of substellar companions with masses between 1 and 75               M               Jup               and semimajor axes between 5 and 300 au. For this purpose, we adopt detection limits as a function of angular separation from the survey data for all stars converted into mass and projected orbital separation using the BEX-COND-hot evolutionary tracks and known distance to each system. Based on the results obtained for each star and on the 13 detections in the sample, we use a Markov chain Monte Carlo tool to compare our observations to two different types of models. The first is a parametric model based on observational constraints, and the second type are numerical models that combine advanced core accretion and gravitational instability planet population synthesis. Using the parametric model, we show that the frequencies of systems with at least one substellar companion are 23.0               -9.7               +13.5               , 5.8               -2.8               +4.7               , and 12.6               -7.1               +12.9               \% for BA, FGK, and M stars, respectively. We also demonstrate that a planet-like formation pathway probably dominates the mass range from 1\textendash 75               M               Jup               for companions around BA stars, while for M dwarfs, brown dwarf binaries dominate detections. In contrast, a combination of binary star-like and planet-like formation is required to best fit the observations for FGK stars. Using our population model and restricting our sample to FGK stars, we derive a frequency of 5.7               -2.8               +3.8               \%, consistent with predictions from the parametric model. More generally, the frequency values that we derive are in excellent agreement with values obtained in previous studies.},

One of our innovations is that we insert simulated point sources into the science images, which we then try to recover with maximum S/N. This improves the S/N of real point sources elsewhere in the field. The algorithm, based on the locally optimized combination of images (LOCI) method, is called Matched LOCI or MLOCI. We show with Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) data on HD 135344 B and Near-Infrared Coronagraphic Imager (NICI) data on several stars that the new algorithm can improve the S/N of point source detections by 30\textendash 400\% over past methods. We also find no increase in false detections rates. No prior knowledge of candidate companion locations is required to use MLOCI. On the other hand, while non-blind applications may yield linear combinations of science images that seem to increase the S/N of true sources by a factor {$>$}2, they can also yield false detections at high rates. This is a potential pitfall when trying to confirm marginal detections or to redetect point sources found in previous epochs. These findings are relevant to any method where the coefficients of the linear combination are considered tunable, e.g., LOCI and principal component analysis (PCA). Thus we recommend that false detection rates be analyzed when using these techniques.},

We analyze imaging data and corresponding adaptive optics telemetry, observing conditions, and other metadata over a three-year time period to characterize the performance of the instrument and predict the detection limits of future observations. We systematically process images from 359 observations of 304 unique stars to subtract residual starlight (i.e., the coronagraphic point-spread function) of the target star using two methods: angular differential imaging (ADI) and reference star differential imaging (RDI). We find that for the typical parallactic angle (PA) rotation of our data set ({$\sim$}10\textdegree ), RDI provides gains over ADI for angular separations smaller than 0.{${''}$}25. Furthermore, we find a power-law relation between the angular separation from the host star and the minimum PA rotation required for ADI to outperform RDI, with a power-law index of -1.18 {$\pm$} 0.08. Finally, we use random forest models to estimate ADI and RDI post-processed detection limits a priori. These models, which we provide publicly on a website, explain 70\%\textendash 80\% of the variance in ADI detection limits and 30\%\textendash 50\% of the variance in RDI detection limits. Averaged over a range of angular separations, our models predict both ADI and RDI contrast to within a factor of 2.

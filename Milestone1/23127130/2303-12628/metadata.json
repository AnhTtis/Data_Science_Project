    "abstract": "Quantum entanglement generation is generally known to be impossible by any classical means. According to Poisson statistics, coherent photons are not considered quantum particles due to the bunching phenomenon. Recently, a coherence approach has been applied to interpret quantum features such as the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect, Franson-type nonlocal correlation, and delayed-choice quantum eraser, where the quantum feature is due to basis-product superposition at the cost of 50 % photon loss. For this, it has been understood that a fixed sum-phase relation between paired photons is the bedrock of quantum entanglement. Here, coherently driven quantum features of the HOM effects are presented using linear optics-based polarization-basis control. Like quantum operator-based destructive interference in the HOM theory, a perfectly coherent analysis shows the same photon bunching of the paired coherent photons on a beam splitter, whereas individual output intensities are uniform.",

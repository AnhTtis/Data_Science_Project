    "abstract": "The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic revealed the criticality of timely intervention in a situation exacerbated by a shortage in medical staff and equipment. Pain-level screening is the initial step toward identifying the severity of patient conditions. Automatic recognition of state and feelings help in identifying patient symptoms to take immediate adequate action and providing a patient-centric medical plan tailored to a patient's state. In this paper, we propose a framework for pain-level detection for deployment in the United Arab Emirates and assess its performance using the most used approaches in the literature. Our results show that a deployment of a pain-level deep learning detection framework is promising in identifying the pain level accurately.",

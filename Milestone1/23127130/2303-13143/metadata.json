    "abstract": "Given a complex vector subspace $V$ of $\\mathbb{C}^n$, the dimension of the amoeba of $V \\cap (\\mathbb{C}^*)^n$ depends only on the matroid that $V$ defines on the ground set $\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}$. Here we prove that this dimension is given by the minimum of a certain function over all partitions of the ground set, as previously conjectured by Rau. We also prove that this formula can be evaluated in polynomial time.",

In this paper, we propose a novel C$^2$PNet for single image dehazing. Instead of using non-consensual negatives, we introduce consensual negatives to construct contrastive samples and then apply a curricular contrastive regularization that considers the difficulty of the negatives to constrain a more compact solution space. To enhance the interpretability of the feature space, we further design a physics-aware dual-branch unit based on the physics model. The features produced by the unit are enforced to conform with the hazing process, thus facilitating haze removal. Extensive experiments demonstrate the validity and generality of the proposed method.

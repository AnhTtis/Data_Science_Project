    "abstract": "We present the first study of galaxy evolution in $\\ddotμ$ based cosmologies. We find that recent JWST observations of massive galaxies at extremely high redshifts are consistent with such a cosmology. However, the low redshift Universe is entirely divergent from the $\\ddotμ$ cosmic star formation rate density. We thus propose that our Universe was at one point dominated by a Primordial Bovine Herd (PBH) which later decayed producing dark energy. Note that we do not detail the mechanisms by which this decay process takes place. Despite its vanishingly small probability for existence, a $\\ddotμ$ based cosmological model marries the disparate findings in the high and low redshift Universe.",

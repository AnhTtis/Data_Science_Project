    "abstract": "End-to-end semantic communication (ESC) system is able to improve communication efficiency by only transmitting the semantics of the input rather than raw bits. Although promising, ESC has also been shown susceptible to the crafted physical layer adversarial perturbations due to the openness of wireless channels and the sensitivity of neural models. Previous works focus more on the physical layer white-box attacks, while the challenging black-box ones, as more practical adversaries in real-world cases, are still largely under-explored. To this end, we present SemBLK, a novel method that can learn to generate destructive physical layer semantic attacks for an ESC system under the black-box setting, where the adversaries are imperceptible to humans. Specifically, 1) we first introduce a surrogate semantic encoder and train its parameters by exploring a limited number of queries to an existing ESC system. 2) Equipped with such a surrogate encoder, we then propose a novel semantic perturbation generation method to learn to boost the physical layer attacks with semantic adversaries. Experiments on two public datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed SemBLK in attacking the ESC system under the black-box setting. Finally, we provide case studies to visually justify the superiority of our physical layer semantic perturbations.",

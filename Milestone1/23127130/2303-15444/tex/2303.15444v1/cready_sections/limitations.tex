\section{Limitations}
\label{sec:limitations}
Differently than current quantum methods for single-model robust fitting \cite{Doan_2022_CVPR}, our approach does not terminate with a solution paired with its \emph{error bound}.  
Additionally, the decomposition policy at the core of \ourmethoddec does not provide theoretical guarantees of global optimality, as globally optimal models may be discarded with locally optimal selection performed by \ourmethod.
We believe it is worth trying to investigate this research question in future work.

\section{Conclusion} 
\label{sec:conclusion}
We brought a new, very important problem into AQC-admissible form.
Our method shows promising results on a variety of datasets for MMF and even surpasses the quantum SotA on single-model fitting, although not explicitly designed for such task.
We believe it offers many avenues for future research.

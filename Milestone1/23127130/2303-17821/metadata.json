    "abstract": "In this paper, we compute for odd fundamental discriminants $D>1$ the Fourier expansion of non-holomorphic elliptic Eisenstein series for $Γ_0(D)$ with quadratic nebentypus character $χ_D$ satisfying a certain plus space condition. For each genus of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, we obtain an associated plus space condition and corresponding Eisenstein series in all positive even weights. In weight $k=2$, the Fourier coefficients are associated to the geometry of Hirzebruch--Zagier divisors on Hilbert modular surfaces.",

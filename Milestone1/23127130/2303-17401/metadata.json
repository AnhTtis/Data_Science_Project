    "abstract": "Superconducting-nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) have enabled the realization of several quantum optics technologies thanks to their high detection efficiency, low dark-counts, and fast recovery time. However, the widespread use of technologies such as linear optical quantum computing (LOQC), quasi-deterministic single photon sources and quantum repeaters requires faster detectors that can distinguish between different photon number states. Here, we report the fabrication of an SNSPD array composed of 14 independent pixels, achieving a system detection efficiency (SDE) of 90% in the telecom band. By reading each pixel of the array independently we show that the detector can detect telecom photons at 1.5 GHz with 45% absolute SDE. We exploit the dynamic PNR of the array to demonstrate accurate state reconstruction for different photon-number statistics for a wide range of light inputs, including operation with long-duration light pulses, as commonly obtained with some cavity-based sources. We show 2-photon and 3-photon fidelities of 74% and 57% respectively, which represent state-of-the-art results for fiber-coupled SNSPDs.",

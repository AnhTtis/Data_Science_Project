    "abstract": "Microstructure--property relationships are key to effective design of structural materials for advanced applications. Advances in computational methods enabled modeling microstructure-sensitive properties using 3D models (e.g., finite elements) based on microstructure representative volumes. 3D microstructure data required as input to these models are typically obtained from either 3D characterization experiments or digital reconstruction based on statistics from 2D microstructure images. In this work, we present machine learning (ML) approaches to modeling effective properties of heterogeneous materials directly from 2D microstructure sections. To this end, we consider statistical learning models based on spatial correlations and convolutional neural networks as two distinct ML strategies. In both strategies, models are trained on a dataset of synthetically generated 3D microstructures and their properties obtained from micromechanical 3D simulations. Upon training, the models predict properties from 2D microstructure sections. The advantage of the presented models is that they only need 2D sections, whose experimental acquisition is more accessible compared to 3D characterization. Furthermore, the present models do not require digital reconstruction of 3D microstructures.",

abstract = "Material structure and defects created during additive manufacturing contribute to the variability in mechanical properties of these parts, limiting their use for critical applications. Three-dimensional crystallographic, structural, and chemical information in electron beam melted Inconel 718 was collected from the sub-micron to the millimeter scale using the TriBeam tomography system. The relationship of defects to the surrounding microstructure has been studied in detail. Lack of fusion defects created sharp discontinuities in the grain morphology that extended several build layers beyond the layer where the defect originated. Nitrides and carbides in the size range of 1.25 μm to 10 μm were observed throughout the volume, with pronounced nitride clustering. The similarities between solidification in additive manufacturing and traditional manufacturing processes are demonstrated by the comparable size and distribution of carbides measured for industrial-scale samples of 718. Defects created during additive manufacturing cannot be easily remedied via standard post-processing techniques, and will likely diminish the mechanical performance of additively manufactured parts."

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. In the present contribution, a phenomenological constitutive model of medium manganese steels, in which both twinning-induced (TWIP) and transformation-induced (TRIP) plasticity enhancing mechanisms are activated, is implemented in the finite element framework. The implementation is utilized for the analysis of the full-field strain partitioning in dual-phase microstructure maps obtained from electron backscattering diffraction. The results of the finite element analysis suggest that the strain localization in the studied steel has an alternating character. Specifically, in the low strain region, most of the externally imposed deformation is accommodated by the initially softer austenite. The higher strain hardening rate of austenite due to deformation twinning (TWIP effect) and the mechanically-induced transformation to martensite (TRIP effect) results in a shift of the strain localization to ferrite. This alternating strain localization is a key feature that distinguishes the medium manganese TWIP+TRIP steel. It is shown that this alternating strain localization cont ributes to the superior mechanical behavior of medium manganese TWIP+TRIP steel reported in the literature.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. In this study, porous titanium samples were manufactured by a space holder method with sodium chloride. Each porous titanium sample contained two types of pores based on their sizes: macropores and micropores. Macropores were those emerged from removing the space holder, whereas micropores were voids created during powder compaction. The porous titanium exhibited low elastic modulus close to that of the human bone. Computed tomography (CT) was employed to examine the porous structure of the Ti samples. The CT results were then used in finite element simulations for analysis of the mechanical behavior of the porous titanium. The CT-based finite element model was found to give better results compared to the unit-cell finite element model in terms of agreement with the experimental data. The CT model combined with the strain hardening behavior of Ti having micropores prescribed to the matrix allowed for accurate predictions of elastic modulus, yield strength, and flow stress. These results signify the importance of taking into account pores at different scales as well as their morphology and distribution at least at macroscale.},

abstract = {Three-dimensional cubic unit cells containing 30 non-overlapping identical spheres randomly distributed were generated using a new, modified random sequential adsortion algorithm suitable for particle volume fractions of up to 50{\%}. The elastic constants of the ensemble of spheres embedded in a continuous and isotropic elastic matrix were computed through the finite element analysis of the three-dimensional periodic unit cells, whose size was chosen as a compromise between the minimum size required to obtain accurate results in the statistical sense and the maximum one imposed by the computational cost. Three types of materials were studied: rigid spheres and spherical voids in an elastic matrix and a typical composite made up of glass spheres in an epoxy resin. The moduli obtained for different unit cells showed very little scatter, and the average values obtained from the analysis of four unit cells could be considered very close to the "exact" solution to the problem, in agreement with the results of Drugan and Willis (J. Mech. Phys. Solids 44 (1996) 497) referring to the size of the representative volume element for elastic composites. They were used to assess the accuracy of three classical analytical models: the Mori-Tanaka mean-field analysis, the generalized self-consistent method, and Torquato's third-order approximation. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Lack of assurance of quality with additively manufactured (AM) parts is a key technological barrier that prevents manufacturers from adopting AM technologies, especially for high-value applications where component failure cannot be tolerated. Developments in process control have allowed significant enhancement of AM techniques and marked improvements in surface roughness and material properties, along with a reduction in inter-build variation and the occurrence of embedded material discontinuities. As a result, the exploitation of AM processes continues to accelerate. Unlike established subtractive processes, where in-process monitoring is now commonplace, factory-ready AM processes have not yet incorporated monitoring technologies that allow discontinuities to be detected in process. Researchers have investigated new forms of instrumentation and adaptive approaches which, when integrated, will allow further enhancement to the assurance that can be offered when producing AM components. The state-of-the-art with respect to inspection methodologies compatible with AM processes is explored here. Their suitability for the inspection and identification of typical material discontinuities and failure modes is discussed with the intention of identifying new avenues for research and proposing approaches to integration into future generations of AM systems.},

abstract = {Five patients with isolated clefts in the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve, unassociated with atrioventricular septal defects, are described. All had significant mitral regurgitation, with the cleft being the only abnormality in three. Two patients had an associated ventricular septal defect, one with a straddling right atrioventricular valve. Angiocardiography in four showed moderate regurgitation, but was not able to delineate the aetiology. Two dimensional echocardiography showed a constant defect in the anterior leaflet, pointing towards the left ventricular outflow tract. This differed from 30 cases with atrioventricular septal defects where the "cleft" pointed towards the interventricular septum and was situated between the anterior and posterior bridging leaflets. All cases with isolated clefts had surgical correction, with minimal residual regurgitation on follow-up examination in two cases. Our current policy in patients with uncomplicated isolated cleft involves non-invasive assessment of these children and surgical correction if the regurgitation is significant. Most cardiologists and surgeons have adopted a conservative approach to the child with mitral regurgita-iion. This-is justified as the prospect of mitral valve replacement in this age group is not to be considered lightly, in view of the problems associated with prosthetic valves. I Reconstructive surgery may prove to be possible, but usually this cannot confidently be decided before operation on the basis of traditional investigational techniques. So the child goes for operation in an atmosphere of uncertainty, with all those involved hoping, but usually not knowing, that recon-structive surgery will be possible. Part of the basis for uncertainty is the wide variability of anatomical substrates for congenital mitral regurgitation. This may be produced by redundant and deficient chordae tendineae, parachute mitral valve and its variants, anomalous mitral arcade, floppy mitral valve, and, rarely, Ebstein's anomaly of the mitral valve.2 3},

@article{Goodlet2017,
Abstract = {Finite element (FE) modeling has been coupled with resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS) for nondestructive evaluation (NDE) of high temperature damage induced by mechanical loading. Forward FE models predict mode-specific changes in resonance frequencies (ΔfR), inform RUS measurements of mode-type, and identify diagnostic resonance modes sensitive to individual or multiple concurrent damage mechanisms. The magnitude of modeled ΔfR correlate very well with the magnitude of measured ΔfR from RUS, affording quantitative assessments of damage. This approach was employed to study creep damage in a polycrystalline Ni-based superalloy (Mar-M247) at 950$\,^{\circ}$C. After iterative applications of creep strains up to 8.8\%, RUS measurements recorded ΔfR that correspond to the accumulation of plastic deformation and cracks in the gauge section of a cylindrical dog-bone specimen. Of the first 50 resonance modes that occur, ranging from 3 to 220kHz, modes classified as longitudinal bending were most sensitive to creep damage while transverse bending modes were found to be largely unaffected. Measure to model comparisons of ΔfR show that the deformation experienced by the specimen during creep, specifically uniform elongation of the gauge section, is responsible for a majority of the measured ΔfR until at least 6.1\% creep strain. After 8.8\% strain considerable surface cracking along the gauge section of the dog-bone was observed, for which FE models indicate low-frequency longitudinal bending modes are significantly affected. Key differences between historical implementations of RUS for NDE and the FE model-based framework developed herein are discussed, with attention to general implementation of a FE model-based framework for NDE of damage.},

abstract = {The problem of determining exact expressions for the effective stiffness tensor macroscopically anisotropic, two-phase composite media of arbitrary microstructure in arbitrary space dimension d is considered. We depart from previous treatments by introducing an integral equation for the “cavity” strain field. This leads to new, exact series expansions for the effective stiffness tensor of macroscopically anisotropic, ddimensional, two-phase composite media in powers of the “elastic polarizabilities”. The nth-order tensor coefficients of these expansions are explicitly expressed as absolutely convergent integrals over products of certain tensor fields and a determinant involving n-point correlation functions that characterize the microstructure. For the special case of macroscopically isotropic media, these series expressions may be regarded as expansions that perturb about the optimal structures that realize the Hashin-Shtrikman bounds (e.g. coated-inclusion assemblages or finite-rank laminates). Similarly, for macroscopically anisotropic media, the series expressions may be regarded as expansions that perturb about optimal structures that realize Willis' bounds. For isotropic multiphase composites, we remark on the behavior of the effective moduli as the space dimension d tends to infinity.},

abstract = {Recently P.H. Dederichs and R. Zeller (1973) have developed a formal theory of the bounds of odd order n for the effective elastic moduli of linearly elastic, disordered materials. The bounds are established by use of statistical information given in terms of correlation functions up to order n (= 1, 3, 5,...). This theory is extended to include the bounds of even order n. It is indicated how these bounds can be made optimum under the given statistical information. The results for bounds of even and odd order are obtained in forms which resemble Neumann series, containing multiple integrals up to order (n-1). These integrals can be calculated for certain materials which are classified in terms of a gradual statistical homogeneity, isotropy and disorder. Materials which possess these properties up to the correlation functions of nth order are called overall grade n materials. The optimum bounds for overall grade 2 and grade 3 materials are given explicitly. Optimum bounds for materials which are of grade ??? in homogeneity and isotropy (i.e. (statistically) perfectly homogeneous and isotropic) and, at the same time, disordered of grade 2 or 3 are also derived. Those for grade 2 in disorder are the Z. Hashin and S. Shtrikman's (1963) bounds. Those for grade 3 are the narrowest, explicit bounds so far derived for random elastic materials. They contain within themselves the so-called self-consistent elastic moduli. ?? 1977.},

abstract = {It is supposed that a region within an isotropic elastic solid undergoes a spontaneous change of form which, if the surrounding material were absent, would be some prescribed homogeneous deformation. Because of the presence of the surrounding material stresses will be present both inside and outside the region. The resulting elastic field may be found very simply with the help of a sequence of imaginary cutting, straining and welding operations. In particular, if the region is an ellipsoid the strain inside it is uniform and may be expressed in terms of tabulated elliptic integrals. In this case a further problem may be solved. An ellipsoidal region in an infinite medium has elastic constants different from those of the rest of the material; how does the presence of this inhomogeneity disturb an applied stress-field uniform at large distances? It is shown that to answer several questions of physical or engineering interest it is necessary to know only the relatively simple elastic field inside the ellipsoid.},

abstract = {Highlights • A new model for predicting effective stress-strain curves of composites is presented. • The model is based on data-driven microstructure-response linkages. • Strength contrast is additionally incorporated into linkages to capture hardening. • Model shows comparable accuracy with FEM at much lower computational cost. Abstract In this contribution, we present a new Materials Knowledge System framework for microstructure-sensitive predictions of effective stress-strain responses in composite materials. The model is developed for composites with a wide range of combinations of strain hardening laws and topologies of the constituents. The theoretical foundation of the model is inspired by statistical continuum theories, leveraged by mean-field approximation of self-consistent models, and calibrated to data obtained from micromechanical finite element simulations. The model also relies on newly formulated data-driven linkages between micromechanical responses (phase-average strain rates and effective strength) and microstructure as well as strength contrast of the constituents. The paper describes in detail the theoretical development of the model, its implementation into an efficient computational plasticity framework, calibration of the linkages, and demonstration of the model predictions on two-phase composites with isotropic constituents exhibiting linear and power-law strain hardening laws. It is shown that the model reproduces finite element results reasonably well with significant savings of the computational cost.},

We use the VPSC model for predicting texture development during rolling and axisymmetric deformation of Zirconium alloys, and to calculate the yield locus and the Lankford coefficient of rolled Zircaloy sheet. We compare our results with experimental data and find that they are in good agreement with the available experimental evidence. We also compare the VPSC predictions with the ones of a Full Constraints approach and observe that they differ both quantitatively and qualitatively: according with the predictions of the VPSC scheme, deformation is accommodated mostly by the soft systems, the twinning activity is much lower, and fewer systems are active, in average, per grain. These results are a consequence of having accounted for the grain interaction with its surroundings, which is a crucial aspect when modeling plastically anisotropic materials.},

abstract = {A fundamental problem in mechanics of materials is the computation of the macroscopic response of polycrystalline aggregates from the properties of their constituent single-crystal grains and the microstructure. In this work, the nonlinear homogenization method of deBotton and Ponte Castaneda (1995) is used to compute `variational' self-consistent estimates for the effective behavior of various types of cubic viscoplastic polycrystals. In contrast with earlier estimates of the self-consistent type, such as those arising from the `incremental' and `tangent' schemes, the new estimates are found to satisfy all known bounds, even in the strongly nonlinear, rate-insensitive limit, and to exhibit a more realistic scaling law at large grain anisotropy. Also, unlike the Taylor and Reuss estimates, they are able to account for grain shape in a rigorous statistical sense. For these reasons, they can be shown to be significantly more accurate than earlier estimates. Thus, for example, the new self-consistent estimates can be less than half the corresponding Taylor estimates for ionic polycrystals with highly anisotropic `flat' grains.},

abstract = {Viscoplastic self-consistent polycrystal models have been successful in addressing and explaining features of plastic deformation which cannot be treated with the Taylor condition of isostrain. In particular, these models have been applied to the simulation of plastic deformation and texture development in materials with hexagonal, trigonal, orthorhombic and triclinic symmetry. An important assumption required to solve the equilibrium equation within self-consistent formulations is that the strain-rate varies linearly with the stress in the homogeneous effective medium surrounding the inclusion. The characteristic of such a linear relation has been a matter of debate and two extreme cases can be identified: the tangent and the secant approaches. The secant approach has associated with it a stiffer inclusion-matrix interaction than the tangent approach and is closer to the Taylor approach. In this work we perform a systematic study of the implications of both assumptions on the response of cubic and hexagonal materials (texture development, system activity, stress and strain-rate deviations). In addition, we argue that the strength of the matrix-inclusion interaction should not be constant but should depend on the capability of each orientation to accommodate the particular deformation mode imposed externally. As a consequence, we propose a relative directional compliance (RDC) criterion for defining a variable interaction between grain and matrix depending on their relative compliances and compare the predictions of the RDC approach with the predictions of the secant and the tangent schemes.},

The single crystal behavior is based on crystallographic slip, and the slip rate is a non-linear function of the resolved shear stress. The time independent plasticity is obtained as a limit when the rate sensitivity tends to zero. The polycrystal behavior is obtained from the single crystal constitutive relation by solving integral equations derived from the field equations. A self-consistent approach is developed, where each grain is assumed to be a single ellipsoidal inclusion in a homogeneous equivalent medium. An interaction formula is derived and the local strain rates are calculated by resolving a nonlinear system of equations.

abstract = {In polycrystalline aggregates deforming by crystal plasticity, the local shears on each slip system can be significantly affected by the intergranular interaction. Therefore, in the framework of mean-field approaches, the intragrain strain heterogeneity must be taken into account when dealing with microstructure evolution associated with strain hardening. For that goal, a novel treatment is proposed and applied to a two-dimensional linearly viscous polycrystal. The results of the implementation of this new hardening treatment within the self-consistent scheme are compared to those of a fast Fourier transform-based full-field computation, considered as a reference solution. It is shown that the evolution with strain of the grain average reference resolved shear stress (RRSS) is well reproduced by the proposed scheme. The overall stress response of the polycrystal is slightly underestimated, due to some intrinsic heterogeneity of the distribution of RRSS. {\textcopyright} 2006 Acta Materialia Inc.},

abstract = {Publisher Summary $\backslash$nThis chapter elaborates some closely related methods developed to estimate the effective behavior of nonlinear composites with random microstructures. The constitutive behavior of the individual constituents of the composite is assumed to be governed by a potential, or strain-energy function, in such a way that the strain and stress fields are related by the constitutive relation. The response of the phases is assumed to be linear for purely hydrostatic loadings and nonlinear in shear. The extension of the Hashin–Shtrikman variational principles, which can be used to obtain improved bounds (depending on up to two-point statistical information) for nonlinear composites, is presented. It is possible to obtain nontrivial lower bounds for the effective stress potential by an analogous development taking the polarization field to be piecewise constant. The variational principles are used to generate a general class of bounds for nonlinear composites, by making suitable approximations in the set of admissible linear comparison composites. Various interpretations of the variational procedures are developed, including an interpretation of the resulting bounds in terms of secant moduli. The variational principles for materials with a certain concavity hypothesis are also elaborated.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Inc.There is a critical need for the development and verification of practically useful multiscale modeling strategies for simulating the mechanical response of multiphase metallic materials with heterogeneous microstructures. In this contribution, we present data-driven reduced order models for effective yield strength and strain partitioning in such microstructures. These models are built employing the recently developed framework of Materials Knowledge Systems that employ 2-point spatial correlations (or 2-point statistics) for the quantification of the heterostructures and principal component analyses for their low-dimensional representation. The models are calibrated to a large collection of finite element (FE) results obtained for a diverse range of microstructures with various sizes, shapes, and volume fractions of the phases. The performance of the models is evaluated by comparing the predictions of yield strength and strain partitioning in two-phase materials with the corresponding predictions from a classical self-consistent model as well as results of full-field FE simulations. The reduced-order models developed in this work show an excellent combination of accuracy and computational efficiency, and therefore present an important advance towards computationally efficient microstructure-sensitive multiscale modeling frameworks.},

In this paper we determine, in the space of fourth-order tensors with major and minor symmetries, a special set of irreducible basis tensors, with which we obtain a simple explicit formula for the VRH average for elastic polycrystals with arbitrary crystal and texture symmetries.

One consists of randomly oriented crystallites and exhibits isotropic elastic behavior (two elastic constants), and the other has been highly textured by rolling and exhibits anisotropic elastic behavior (three elastic constants). The elastic constants are measured using electron backscatter diffraction, LRUS, and time domain laser ultrasound (LU). The elastic constants of the isotropic sample obtained via electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), LU, and LRUS agree closely. However, for the anisotropic sample, there is considerable disagreement between results obtained using LRUS and results obtained using LU and EBSD. Analysis reveals that increasing the dimensionality of the modulus space leads to a questions of whether the LRUS results are unique to within experimental error. The consequence is that for anisotropic materials, small measurement uncertainties can lead to large uncertainties in the measured elastic constants. This observation has important implications for the use of LRUS to measure the elastic constants of thin texture samples.},

@article{Fullwood2008,
abstract = {Homogenization relations, linking a material's properties at the mesoscale to those at the macroscale, are fundamental tools for design and analysis of microstructure. Recent advances in this field have successfully applied spectral techniques to Kroner-type perturbation expansions for polycrystalline and composite materials to provide efficient inverse relations for materials design. These expansions have been termed 'weak-contrast' expansions due to the conditionally convergent integrals, and the reliance upon only small perturbations from the reference property. In 1955, Brown suggested a different expansion for electrical conductivity that resulted in absolutely convergent integrals. Torquato subsequently applied the method to elasticity, with good results even for high-contrast materials; thus it is commonly referred to as a 'strong contrast' expansion. The methodology has been applied to elasticity for two phases of isotropic material, generally assuming macroscopic isotropy (with noted exceptions), thus resulting in a rather elegant form of the solution. More recently, a multi-phase form of the solution was developed for conductivity. This paper builds upon this result to apply the method to elasticity of polycrystalline materials with both local and global anisotropy. New spectral formulations are subsequently developed for both the weak and strong contrast solutions. These form the basis for efficient microstructure analysis using these frameworks, and subsequently for inverse design applications. The process is taken through to demonstration of a property closure, which acts as the basis for materials design; the closure delineates the envelope of all physically realizable property combinations for the chosen properties, based on the particular homogenization relation being used. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The current protocols of quantifying grain size and morphology often rely on microstructure metrics (e.g., mean grain diameter) that overlook important details of the mesostructure. In this work, we present a quantification framework based on directionally resolved chord length distribution and principal component analysis as a means of extracting additional information from 2-D microstructural maps. Towards this end, we first present in detail a method for calculating chord length distribution based on boundary segments available in modern digital datasets (e.g., from microscopy post-processing) and their low-rank representations by principal component analysis. The utility of the proposed framework for capturing grain size, morphology, and their anisotropy for efficient visualization, representation, and specification of polycrystalline microstructures is then demonstrated in case studies on datasets from synthetic generation, experiments (on Ni-base superalloys), and simulations (on steel during recrystallization).},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a two-step Bayesian framework for the estimation of the intrinsic single crystal elastic stiffness parameters from the measurements of spherical indentation stress-strain responses in multiple individual grains of a polycrystalline sample, whose crystal lattice orientations have been measured using electron back-scattered diffraction technique. The first step requires the establishment of the functional dependence of the indentation elastic modulus given the lattice orientation and the intrinsic single crystal elastic stiffness parameters. Previous efforts for this step required a large database of computationally expensive finite element (FE) simulations in order to establish this function with adequate accuracy. In this paper, it is shown that the introduction of a Bayesian framework can greatly reduce the number of simulations necessary to establish this function, while introducing practically useful measures of uncertainty which can guide the selection of specific additional simulations that are expected to best improve the predictive accuracy of the function. The second step involves a Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) sampling of the distribution of possible values for the single crystal elastic stiffness parameters based on a given set of experimentally measured elastic indentation moduli in individual grains of different lattice orientations. This second step is accomplished by calibrating the available experimental data to the function established in the first step. This novel framework is presented and demonstrated in this paper for an as-cast cubic polycrystalline Fe-3% Si sample and a hexagonal polycrystalline commercially pure (CP-Ti) titanium sample.},

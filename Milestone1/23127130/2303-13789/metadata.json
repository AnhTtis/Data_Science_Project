    "abstract": "For some classical solutions $Ψ_\\mathrm{sol}$ in Witten's bosonic string field theory, it was proven that energy of the solution is proportional to the Ellwood invariant $\\mathrm{Tr}(\\mathcal{V}Ψ_\\mathrm{sol})$ with $\\mathcal{V}=c\\bar{c}\\partial X^0\\bar{\\partial}X^0$. We examine the relation for solutions involving $X^0$ variables. As a result, we obtain that the relation may not hold for such solutions. Namely, there is a possibility that the energy is not proportional to the Ellwood invariant.",

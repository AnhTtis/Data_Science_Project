    "abstract": "This paper deals with speeding up the convergence of a class of two-step iterative methods for solving linear systems of equations. To implement the acceleration technique, the residual norm associated with computed approximations for each sub-iterate is minimized over a certain two-dimensional subspace. Convergence properties of the proposed method are studied in detail. The approach is further developed to solve (regularized) normal equations arising from the discretization of ill-posed problems. The results of numerical experiments are reported to illustrate the performance of exact and inexact variants of the method on several test problems from different application areas.",

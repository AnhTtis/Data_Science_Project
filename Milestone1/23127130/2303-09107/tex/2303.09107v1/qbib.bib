	abstract = {In contrast to the spatial Bell's inequalities which probe entanglement between spatially separated systems, the Leggett–Garg inequalities test the correlations of a single system measured at different times. Violation of a genuine Leggett–Garg test implies either the absence of a realistic description of the system or the impossibility of measuring the system without disturbing it. Quantum mechanics violates the inequalities on both accounts and the original motivation for these inequalities was as a test for quantum coherence in macroscopic systems. The last few years has seen a number of experimental tests and violations of these inequalities in a variety of microscopic systems such as superconducting qubits, nuclear spins, and photons. In this article, we provide an introduction to the Leggett–Garg inequalities and review these latest experimental developments. We discuss important topics such as the significance of the non-invasive measurability assumption, the clumsiness loophole, and the role of weak measurements. Also covered are some recent theoretical proposals for the application of Leggett–Garg inequalities in quantum transport, quantum biology and nano-mechanical systems.}

For single-qubit measurements, this partial projection has been demonstrated with violations of the Leggett--Garg inequality. Here we investigate the effects of weak measurement on a maximally entangled Bell state through application of the Hybrid Bell--Leggett--Garg inequality (BLGI) on a linear chain of four transmon qubits. By correlating the results of weak ancilla measurements with subsequent projective readout, we achieve a violation of the BLGI with 27 s.d.s. of certainty.},

	abstract = {Bell’s theorem renders quantum correlations distinct from those of any local-realistic model. Although being stronger than classical correlations, quantum correlations are limited by the Tsirelson bound. This bound, however, applies for Hermitian, commutative operators corresponding to non-signaling observables in Alice’s and Bob’s spacelike-separated labs. As an attempt to explore theories beyond quantum mechanics and analyze the uniqueness of the latter, we examine in this work the extent of non-local correlations when relaxing these fundamental assumptions, which allows for theories with non-local signaling. We prove that, somewhat surprisingly, the Tsirelson bound in the Bell–Clauser–Horne–Shimony–Holt scenario, and similarly other related bounds on non-local correlations, remain effective as long as we maintain the Hilbert space structure of the theory. Furthermore, in the case of Hermitian observables we find novel relations between non-locality, local correlations, and signaling. We demonstrate that such non-local signaling theories are naturally simulated by quantum systems of parafermionic zero modes. We numerically study the derived bounds in parafermionic systems, confirming the bounds’ validity yet finding a drastic difference between correlations of ‘signaling’ and ‘non-signaling’ sets of observables. We also propose an experimental procedure for measuring the relevant correlations.}

abstract = {Locality of uncertainty relations can explain why quantum nonlocality is the way it is. If nature allowed nonlocal correlations other than those predicted by quantum mechanics, would that contradict some physical principle? Various approaches have been put forward in the past two decades in an attempt to single out quantum nonlocality. However, none of them can explain the set of quantum correlations arising in the simplest scenarios. Here, it is shown that generalized uncertainty relations, as well as a specific notion of locality, give rise to both familiar and new characterizations of quantum correlations. In particular, we identify a condition, relativistic independence, which states that uncertainty relations are local in the sense that they cannot be influenced by other experimenters’ choices of measuring instruments. We prove that theories with nonlocal correlations stronger than the quantum ones do not satisfy this notion of locality, and therefore, they either violate the underlying generalized uncertainty relations or allow experimenters to nonlocally tamper with the uncertainty relations of their peers.}

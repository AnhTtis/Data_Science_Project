\small \emph{Notes:} This table compares annual labor expenditure and wholesale expenditure for cannabis retail establishments in Washington state for the years 2018-2020. Labor expenditure equals total wages divided by the number of retail establishments (both obtained from the Washington ESD). Establishments with missing UI data are excluded from total wages and establishment counts. COGS is the average annual wholesale expenditure for cannabis retailers in the estimation sample. Wholesale purchases from processor-only licenses are excluded. Data from Washington state ESD, Top Shelf Data, and High Peak Strategy.

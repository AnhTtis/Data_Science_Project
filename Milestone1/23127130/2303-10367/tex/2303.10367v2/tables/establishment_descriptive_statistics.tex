\small \emph{Notes:} This table displays summary statistics for the estimation sample. The sample period is August 2018 through July 2021. Panel (a) reports totals across all establishments and months in the sample. Panel (b) reports monthly averages at the establishment level. The wholesale sample excludes establishments with a processor-only license. Sales between producer-processors are included. Retail revenue is based on tax-inclusive prices. Data source: Top Shelf Data.\\
$^{+}$ For wholesalers, the LCB reports the unit weight for some product types (e.g. flower lots) in 1g units regardless of how the product is actually bundled. For such items, the number of units is the weight of the product in grams. As a result, the number of distinct products visible in the wholesale data is artificially low (since different unit weights are treated as a single product), and the number of units sold is artificially high.

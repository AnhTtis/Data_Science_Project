A growing empirical literature finds that firms pass the cost of minimum wage hikes onto consumers via higher retail prices. Yet, little is known about minimum wage effects on wholesale prices and whether retailers face a wholesale cost shock in addition to the labor cost shock. I exploit the unique market structure of Washington state's legal recreational cannabis industry to investigate minimum wage pass-through to wholesale and retail prices. In a dynamic difference-in-differences framework, I utilize scanner data on \$6 billion of transactions across the supply chain and leverage geographic variation in firms' minimum wage exposure across six minimum wage hikes between 2018 and 2021. When ignoring wholesale cost effects, I find retail pass-through elasticities consistent with existing literature---yet retail pass-through elasticities more than double once wholesale cost effects are accounted for. Retail markups do not adjust to the wholesale cost shock, indicating a full pass-through of the wholesale cost shock to retail prices. The results suggest that previous research may underestimate the impact of minimum wage increases on retail prices. This paper highlights the importance of analyzing the entire supply chain when evaluating the product market effects of minimum wage hikes.

\section{Introduction}
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Minimum wage laws are a popular tool for combating poverty and reducing economic inequality.\footnote{Approximately 90 percent of countries worldwide have instituted some form of minimum wage \citep{ilo2021}.} Yet, despite their pervasiveness, the question of 'who pays' for the minimum wage---i.e. firms, workers, or consumers---remains hotly debated. The answer to this question largely depends on how firms react to the labor cost shock induced by the minimum wage.\footnote{Recent evidence suggests that in some settings, workers' reactions to the minimum wage may also be important (see e.g. \cite{ku2022}).} If firms reduce employment or non-wage compensation (e.g. vacation days or health benefits) for low-wage workers, then low-wage workers bear the brunt of the policy. If firms absorb the cost shock by reducing profits, then firms bear the cost of adjustment. Finally, firms may pass the labor cost shock on to consumers in the form of higher retail prices, in which case consumers pay for the minimum wage increase. Of these three margins of adjustment, the first has received the lion’s share of attention, and evidence on employment effects is conflicted.\footnote{See Neumark (2019) for a recent overview.} The second channel has received less attention, but existing findings point to small profit effects \citep{draca2011,lindner2019}. Instead, recent evidence indicates that the third channel---price adjustment---plays a key role. With the aid of high-frequency price scanner data, a small but growing empirical literature finds that firms fully pass the cost shock through to retail prices, which suggests that nominal wage increases from minimum wage hikes are partly offset by increases in the prices of goods and services \citep{renkin2020, leung2021}. While price scanner data exhibits unparalleled richness, however, it is largely confined to retail outlets like grocery, merchandise, and drug stores.\footnote{One way to overcome this limitation is to use internet-based pricing. \cite{reich2018}, for example, exploit internet-based restaurant menus to study the effects of a 25\% minimum wage increase in San Jose, California in 2013. They find an average price increase of 1.45\%, indicating that most of the cost increase was passed on to consumers.} As a result, less is known about minimum wage pass-through to prices in other sectors. Yet, scanner data carries an additional shortcoming in that it only conveys information on prices at the final point of the supply chain. In principle, minimum wage hikes may affect not only retail outlets, but firms higher up the supply chain as well. If suppliers' increased labor costs are passed on to retailers via wholesale prices, then retailers will face not one, but two cost shocks from a minimum wage hike. The first is the higher labor cost of the retailer's own minimum wage employees---a direct effect. The second is the higher wholesale prices from suppliers---an indirect effect. To the extent that retailers pass both cost shocks on to consumers, retail price adjustment reflects both \emph{direct pass-through} and \emph{indirect pass-through}. The latter may even eclipse the former since, in many retail settings, the cost of goods sold (COGS) accounts for over 80\% of retailers' costs, and retail prices have been shown to be sensitive to even small changes in COGS \citep{eichenbaum2011,nakamura2010,renkin2020}. Crucially, retail scanner data cannot distinguish between these two forms of pass-through because the data only captures point of sale prices. Moreover, the reduced form regressions used in the pass-through literature only reveal the full (i.e. direct and indirect) pass-through to retail prices in the special case that retailers purchase predominantly from local wholesalers. If, instead, wholesale goods are highly tradeable (as with e.g. drugstores and general merchandise stores), then indirect pass-through to retail prices is absorbed by time fixed effects \citep{renkin2020}. In that case, estimates from retail scanner data only pick up direct pass-through effects, and hence, fail to capture the full effect of minimum wage hikes on retail prices. To assess the impact of minimum wage hikes on real wages, it is therefore crucial to examine both direct and indirect pass-through to retail prices.

In this paper, I investigate the impact of minimum wage increases on wholesale and retail prices in Washington state's legal recreational cannabis industry. Washington's cannabis market is an ideal laboratory for studying minimum wage pass-through for several reasons. Cannabis is one of the largest agricultural industries in the state and a major source of employment. The industry is labor-intensive and low-wage at all points of the supply chain, and minimum wage hikes likely induce a sizeable cost shock for wholesalers and retailers alike.\footnote{In this paper, I use the term "wholesaler", "producer", and "producer-processor" interchangeably. This reflects the legal structure of the cannabis market and is described in more detail in section \ref{section:2}.} In other markets, the distinction between wholesaler and retailer is often blurred by vertical integration, making it difficult to distinguish between pass-through at different points of the supply chain. In contrast, vertical integration is strictly prohibited for cannabis businesses, creating clearly defined vertical relationships between wholesalers and retailers. Importantly, the cannabis industry operates under statewide autarky, meaning wholesale and retail establishments are subject to the very same minimum wage hikes. This makes it possible to distinguish between direct and indirect pass-through to retail prices, but it also narrows the set of possible confounders by eliminating the influence of labor and product market shocks in other regions. Finally, unusually rich scanner data provides a close-up of price dynamics for the universe of products at both the wholesale and retail levels. This enables straightforward estimation of direct and indirect pass-through using a reduced-form approach.\footnote{The data also bypasses reliability issues associated with internal firm prices. For example, \cite{hong2017} argues that intrafirm prices may be vulnerable to accounting fictions for tax avoidance or record-keeping purposes.}

To estimate minimum wage pass-through elasticities, I use a dynamic difference-in-differences framework and exploit geographic variation in minimum wage exposure for all 1,192 wholesale and retail establishments over six minimum wage hikes between 2018 and 2021. I use scanner-level data on \$6 billion of wholesale and retail transactions to estimate pass-through to both wholesale and retail prices. Unlike previous studies that use retail scanner data, I also observe prices and quantities for the universe of retailers’ wholesale purchases, which enables me to quantify retailers' exposure to pass-through to wholesale prices. When ignoring wholesale cost effects, I find that a 10\% increase in the minimum wage translates into a 0.7\% increase in retail prices, consistent with existing literature (see e.g. \cite{leung2021}). Yet, I also find that a 10\% increase in the minimum wage corresponds to a 1.79\% increase in wholesale prices. Crucially, once pass-through to wholesale prices is considered, the pass-through elasticity to retail prices more than doubles to 1.92\%. This increase reflects a dominance of indirect over direct pass-through, with elasticities that are proportional to retailers' wholesale and labor cost shares. I also investigate the role of markup adjustment in pass-through to retail prices. In particular, I show that retailers do not adjust markups to the increase in wholesale prices, and that changes in retail markups entirely reflect direct pass-through. This indicates a full pass-through of the wholesale cost shock to retail prices. The finding that, at least in the cannabis industry, the majority of retail pass-through stems from changes in retailers’ wholesale costs (i.e. indirect pass-through) rather than labor costs (i.e. direct pass-through) underscores the importance of examining the entire supply chain when investigating the effects of minimum wage hikes on retail prices.

One concern in the cannabis industry is that rules governing production capacity for wholesalers have created an uneven playing field in which small wholesalers operate on slim margins while large establishments enjoy a higher degree of market power \citep{lcbtier1}. This suggests that large wholesalers may be able to absorb cost shocks along other margins (e.g. by adjusting profits) and thereby exhibit less price pass-through compared to smaller wholesalers. I test this directly and find that pass-through elasticities monotonically decrease with the scale of production---and are zero for the largest wholesalers---consistent with an increased ability of larger firms to adjust to the cost shock along other margins. I find no evidence of employment effects for retailers or wholesalers. Furthermore, I document no effect of minimum wage hikes on cannabis consumption, which precludes demand-induced feedback as a mechanism through which minimum wage hikes affect cannabis prices.

Taken together, my results highlight the importance of examining the entire supply chain---beyond the final point of sale---when investigating the price level effects of minimum wage hikes. Since minimum wage pass-through to retail prices attenuates the increase in real wages desired by policymakers, it is important to consider both direct and indirect pass-through when evaluating the efficacy of minimum wages as a poverty-reduction tool.

I make three main contributions in this paper. First, I provide evidence that minimum wages affect retail \emph{and} wholesale prices. While previous studies have estimated minimum wage pass-through to retail prices, to the best of my knowledge, pass-through to wholesale prices has not been studied before. Importantly, my results imply that retailers face a direct and an indirect cost shock from minimum wage hikes. Since wholesale costs often play an outsize role in retailers' variable cost structure, this suggests that studies that focus solely on a direct effect may be incomplete in a significant way. 

Second, I explicitly quantify direct and indirect pass-through effects. This allows me to compare their magnitudes and relate them to retailers' wholesale and labor cost shares. Previous studies do not distinguish between these two forms of pass-through and do not clarify whether they are estimating combined (i.e. direct and indirect) effects or direct pass-through only. To see this, note that it is common to estimate pass-through using a dynamic difference-in-differences model that relates store-level monthly inflation rates to the percent change in state minimum wages.\footnote{In such a setup, inflation in states with no minimum wage hike serves as the counterfactual for inflation in states with a minimum wage hike.} Such a model delivers different pass-through measures depending on implicit assumptions regarding the nature of retailers' wholesale purchases. If retailers predominantly purchase from local wholesalers, then reduced-form regressions from statewide hikes will capture both direct and indirect pass-through to retail prices. \cite{renkin2020}, for example, show that U.S. grocery stores source mostly from wholesalers located in the same region, and hence, estimates of pass-through to grocery prices may capture total pass-through effects. However, in industries with highly tradeable goods (e.g. drugstores and general merchandise stores), the wholesale cost shock is common across all states and indirect pass-through is absorbed by time fixed effects. In that case, reduced form estimates only reflect direct pass-through and fail to capture the full impact of minimum wages on retail prices, and hence, real wages. I overcome this issue by exploiting variation in the minimum wage bite at the industry subsector-by-county level. Since cannabis retailers and wholesalers belong to different industry subsectors, estimates of direct pass-through to retail prices are independent of wholesale cost effects. Moreover, full information on retailers' upstream transactions allows me to quantify retailers' exposure to the wholesale cost shock, which in turn enables me to estimate indirect pass-through independently from direct pass-through.

Third, the literature on minimum wage pass-through is underdeveloped and heavily centered on restaurants, grocery, drug, and merchandise stores. By investigating pass-through to cannabis prices, I provide novel insight on firms' margins of adjustment in a large agricultural market of growing importance. 

This paper primarily relates to three strands of literature. The first is the small but growing literature on the product market effects of minimum wages, which until recently has centered on the restaurant industry (see e.g. \cite{aaronson2001, reich2018, fougere2010,lindner2019}). Most closely related are two papers by \cite{renkin2020} and \cite{leung2021}, who use high frequency scanner data to study the impact of a large number of state-level minimum wage hikes on consumer prices in the U.S. Both studies employ a difference-in-differences framework and find full and more than full pass-through to grocery prices, respectively, but no effect on prices at merchandise stores. I deviate from these studies by adopting an identification strategy that exploits geographic variation in the minimum wage bite at the industry subsector level. Since cannabis retailers and wholesalers belong to different industry subsectors, this allows me to separately identify direct pass-through to retail and wholesale prices. My paper is a natural extension of \cite{renkin2020}, as they consider the possibility that minimum wage hikes induce a wholesale cost shock, but they cannot test for it because their data does not include information on wholesale cost. Instead, they calculate an upper bound for indirect pass-through using input-output tables under the assumption of full pass-through to wholesale prices. In contrast, I directly observe wholesale cost because my data contains prices and quantities for the universe of retailers' wholesale transactions. I construct a measure of each retailer's exposure to pass-through to wholesale prices and estimate indirect pass-through to retail prices using a reduced-form approach. 

By estimating the effects of the wholesale cost shock on retail markups, I provide empirical support for \citeauthor{renkin2020}'s (\citeyear{renkin2020}) assumption of full wholesale cost pass-through. Nevertheless, while \cite{renkin2020} conclude that indirect and direct pass-through to retail prices may be similar in magnitude, I find indirect pass-through elasticities that are twice as large as direct pass-through elasticities. This reflects substantial pass-through effects to wholesale prices and the subsequently large wholesale cost shock for cannabis retailers.

Second, the paper contributes to the literature on the transmission of cost shocks to firm pricing, much of which concerns exchange rate pass-through in specific industries (see \cite{burstein2014} for an overview). These papers typically combine separate wholesale and retail data sets and use structural models to infer pass-through of wholesale cost shocks to retail prices (see e.g. \citep{nakamura2010,bonnet2013}.\footnote{An exception is \cite{eichenbaum2011} who use data on prices and costs from a single U.S. retailer and find that retail price changes largely reflect changes in wholesale cost. \cite{hong2017} uses similar data to investigate the role of market structure on retail pass-through.} In contrast, my data uniquely identify both parties to each wholesale transaction and allow me to trace each product as it moves across the supply chain. As a result, I can estimate indirect pass-through directly from the data using a reduced form approach. More generally, I add to the literature on the transmission of upstream cost shocks by extending it to the minimum wage context.

Third, the paper contributes to the small but growing literature that uses Washington state's cannabis industry to investigate topics in industrial organization. Most closely related are two papers that study the role of the market structure on cannabis firm pricing. \cite{hollenbeck2021} consider the impact of cannabis license restrictions on retail market power while \cite{hansen2021} examine how a change in Washington's cannabis tax affected vertical integration among cannabis producers. I build on this literature by investigating the effects of minimum wages on cannabis pricing. In addition, I use scanner data from a newer administrative data software system that was introduced in early 2018. The newer data identifies products at the level of the stock keeping unit (SKU), which allows me to construct price indexes at a more granular level than was previously possible.

This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the institutional context for the study. Section 3 details the data and the main empirical strategy. Section 4 presents direct pass-through estimates to wholesale and retail prices and discusses robustness checks. Section 5 investigates indirect pass-through to retail prices and compares them to the direct pass-through estimates from section 4. Section 6 further dissects pass-through by examining markups over marginal input cost and price effect heterogeneity. Section 7 investigates other possible margins of adjustment to minimum wage hikes including employment, productivity, and demand effects. Section 8 concludes.

%% =========================================================
\subsection{The cannabis industry in Washington state}
%% =========================================================

In November 2012, voters in Washington state approved the creation of a legal recreational marijuana market for adults 21 years and older.\footnote{Cannabis production and consumption remains prohibited at the federal level. However, in August 2013, the United States Department of Justice announced that it would not interfere with state-level legalization as long as distribution and sales were strictly regulated by the state.} Cannabis has since become a major agricultural industry in the state. In 2020, retail sales topped \$1.4 billion and the industry contributed \$1.85 billion to gross state product, making it the fourth most valuable agricultural crop in the state behind apples, wheat, and potatoes but ahead of timber, cherries, and hay \citep{wsu2020}. 

\subsubsection*{Cannabis labor}
Several features of cannabis labor make the industry particularly well-suited for investigating the effects of minimum wage hikes. First, cannabis is an important source of employment, and the sector supports approximately 18,700 full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs in Washington \citep{wsu2020}. This mirrors the growing importance of cannabis employment in the U.S. more generally, where, according to one industry report, cannabis employs more than 428,000 workers \citep{leafly2022}.\footnote{To add perspective, there are more cannabis workers than hair stylists, barbers, and cosmetologists combined \citep{leafly2022}.} Second, cannabis is particularly labor intensive. Cannabis is primarily grown in small indoor facilities in a setting that is averse to mechanization and more labor intensive than outdoor cultivation \citep{caulkins2010}. Most harvesting, drying, trimming, and packaging is done by hand, as this allows growers to produce higher quality buds that sell at a higher price point \citep{miller2022}. Cannabis is labor intensive at the retail level as well. Inside each store, a service counter forms a physical barrier between customers and the products, and customers can only make a purchase with the help of a sales representative known as a `budtender'. Budtenders serve one customer at a time, and since a consultation can take several minutes depending on a customer's needs, most retailers employ several budtenders per shift to boost sales volume. Third, wages in cannabis are very low---less than 1/3 to 1/2 of the statewide average wage---reflecting the low-skill nature of cannabis labor. Cannabis producers typically employ 1-2 `master growers', who manage cultivation systems and oversee harvesting, along with a much larger number of low-skill workers who harvest, trim, and package cannabis. Retail budtending requires no formal training and the job resembles low-skilled retail employment in other industries. As a result, a high degree of minimum wage exposure is likely at cannabis establishments at all points of the supply chain. Appendix \ref{appendix:g} describes labor and wages in cannabis in further detail. 

\subsubsection*{The cannabis market structure}
A defining feature of Washington state's cannabis industry is its unique market structure. The industry is regulated by the Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board (LCB) which offers three separate licenses for cannabis businesses, each representing a different stage of the supply chain. The first license is for producers and it allows an establishment to cultivate, harvest, trim, dry, cure, and package cannabis to be sold at wholesale to other licensed producers and processors. The second license is for processors and it permits an establishment to process, dry, cure, and package cannabis to be sold at wholesale to other licensed processors or retailers. While there is some overlap between the producer and the processor licenses, the key distinction is that processors cannot cultivate plants and producers cannot sell to retailers. The third license is for retailers; they are permitted to sell usable cannabis products in retail stores. A key stipulation is that producer and processor licenses can be held simultaneously but retailers cannot obtain either producer or processor licenses.\footnote{Such `tied-house' rules are a remnant of the early days of U.S. alcohol regulation. They were imposed by states to limit the market power of brewers and distillers and prevent monopolies from preying on consumers' ``worst habits" \citep{wallach2014}. Washington state lawmakers adopted similar rules out of an abundance of caution and to increase the likelihood of legalization passing the state legislature \citep{wallach2014}.} As a result, the vast majority of upstream establishments own both producer and processor licenses and are commonly referred to as 'producer-processors'. Importantly, producer-processors may only sell cannabis to licensed retailers---they cannot sell directly to consumers. Retailers, moreover, can only sell to consumers. This creates a complete vertical separation between producer-processors on the one hand, and retailers on the other. Figure \ref{fig:0a} illustrates the different stages of cannabis production and their relation to cannabis licensing.

Another feature of the cannabis market is that it operates under statewide autarky. That is, retailers can only buy from producer-processors located in Washington state, and producer-processors can only sell to retailers in the state. This 'seals off' the core of the supply chain from other U.S. states with legal recreational markets such as Oregon or California.\footnote{The supply chain is not 100 percent sealed off, since consumers from other states can travel to Washington to purchase cannabis at retail stores, and wholesalers can purchase certain inputs such as grow lights, soil, and fertilizers from businesses in other states.} As a result, the entire supply chain is subject to the same minimum wage hikes, and hence, the same labor cost shocks.

Before moving on, it is worth noting several points. First, since the number of establishments with only a processor license (as opposed to a producer-processor license) is very small, I drop these from my analysis. In contrast, I keep establishments with only a producer license since these belong to the same industrial classification as producer-processors (see section \ref{section:3}). Second, I use the term 'producer-processor' and 'wholesaler' interchangeably throughout the paper to refer to upstream establishments. This reflects the dual role played by these establishments in the cannabis market: besides being producers, they also act as wholesalers when viewed from the perspective of retailers. Third, since wholesalers occupy the upstream portion of the supply chain, I assume that the minimum wage only induces a labor cost shock for wholesalers---that is, the minimum wage does not affect material input prices for these firms. In principle, this assumption may not hold entirely and wholesalers may be subject to minimum wage pass-through from their input suppliers. However, wholesale inputs like hydroponic systems, grow lights, and raw materials (e.g. soil or fertilizer) can be purchased from suppliers outside of Washington state, meaning minimum wage pass-through to wholesale input prices is likely small. Therefore, for wholesale prices I only estimate direct pass-through, whereas for retail prices I estimate both direct and indirect pass-through.

\small \emph{Notes:} This figure depicts the flow of cannabis products, from left to right, as they move through the supply chain. Only licensed producers are permitted to cultivate and harvest cannabis plants; producers can only sell to licensed processors, who in turn are permitted to process products; only processors can sell finished products at wholesale to retailers; licensed retailers can sell finished products to end consumers. An establishment can jointly hold producer and processor licenses, so the overwhelming majority of upstream establishments hold both licenses (i.e. producer-processors). Retailers may not hold a producer or a processor license and vice versa. As a result, wholesale (i.e. producer-processors) and retail activities are legally separated.

\subsection{The minimum wage in Washington state}
%% =========================================================

In November 2016, Washington voters approved a ballot measure to scale up the state minimum wage from \$9.47 to \$13.50 by the year 2020. The measure spelled out predetermined, stepwise increases for January 1st each year, with an initial increase to \$11.00 in 2017, then \$11.50 in 2018, \$12.00 in 2019, followed by the final increase to \$13.50 in 2020. Then, starting January 1st, 2021, the minimum wage was to adjust with the federal Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) on an annual basis. Besides the state minimum wage, there are two cities in Washington state with a binding citywide minimum wage. The city of Tacoma's minimum wage took effect in early 2016 with a predetermined schedule of annual increases designed such that the city and state minimum wages converged in 2020, with the latter binding for all subsequent years. Seattle's minimum wage went into effect in April 2015 and contained two sets of hikes depending on whether an employer paid towards an individual employee's medical benefits.\footnote{Firms with over 501 employees are subject to a higher minimum wage than small employers. Since no cannabis business in Seattle has more than 500 employees, the large employer minimum wage does not apply.} For employees earning \$2.19 per hour in benefits (on top of their hourly wage), the minimum wage was identical to the state minimum wage except for a larger (predetermined) jump to \$15 in 2021. In my main analysis, I assume that this is the schedule of hikes applicable to cannabis establishments in Seattle. However, in a series of robustness checks, I also consider the alternative schedule for employees earning less than \$2.19 in benefits. In that schedule, the minimum wage increased more steeply and reached \$15.75 in 2020, while in 2021 it adjusted according to a local CPI (this feature was written into the law in 2015). Due to the potential for reverse causality in that scenario, I drop Seattle establishments from the sample for the 2021 hike and find that results are unaffected (see appendix \ref{appendix:d} for details).\footnote{I also consider potential wage spillovers from Seattle to surrounding areas, in which case estimates for establishments in neighboring cities would also suffer from reverse causality in 2021. See appendix \ref{appendix:d} for details.} For both Seattle and Tacoma, the citywide hikes occurred on the same day of the year as the statewide hikes (January 1st). Figure \ref{fig:0b} summarizes the minimum wage hikes used in my main analysis.

Seattle's minimum wage is depicted under the assumption that employers paid at least \$2.19/hour in benefits (the alternative schedule is depicted in figure \ref{fig:d.1}).

%% =========================================================
\subsection{Price data}
%% =========================================================

To monitor developments in the cannabis market, legalization came with stringent data reporting and sharing requirements for all licensed cannabis businesses. Producer-processors (i.e. wholesalers) and retailers are required to track every step of production from `seed to sale' and they must regularly upload data feeds about plants, harvests, processing, transfers between businesses, and retail sales to the LCB. The data, which is usually reported weekly, contains detailed information on the price and quantity of each product sold by a producer-processor to a retailer, and the subsequent price and quantity of that very same product sold at the retail level.\footnote{Compliance with seed-to-sale traceability is strictly enforced by the LCB. When a business is issued a violation, it can receive a fine, a temporary license suspension, or both. In cases of repeated violations, a license can be revoked by the LCB board. Given such strict enforcement, violations are uncommon. In 2021 for example, the LCB issued 66 violations among approximately 2000 licensees. See: https://lcb.wa.gov/enforcement/violations-and-due-process} The LCB switched providers for its traceability system in October 2017 and again in December 2021, creating two structural breaks in the price data. My sample period lies between these breaks and spans August 2018 through July 2021, a period that covers three statewide and three citywide minimum wage hikes. I obtained the data from Top Shelf Data, a data analytic firm that ingests the raw tracking data from the LCB and matches it with additional product information. The estimation sample covers sales from 1,192 distinct retailers and wholesalers and contains an industry-wide average of 31,800 unique retail products and 18,268 unique wholesale products per month (see table \ref{tab:1}). To give an example, a 1.0 gram package and a 2.0 gram package of Sunset Sherbert usable marijuana (flower) produced by Northwest Harvesting Co are treated as different products in the data.\footnote{Similar to 
 how wines can be distinguished by the grape (e.g. Riesling, Chardonnay, etc), cannabis comes in many strains, which is 'Sunset Sherbert' in the given example.} The LCB classifies products as belonging to one of 12 categories. As table \ref{tab:2} illustrates, usable marijuana (dried flower) and concentrate for inhalation account for more than 80\% of all retail sales.\footnote{Concentrate for inhalation includes both solid cannabinoid concentrates like "wax" or "crumble" as well as liquid vape cartridges.} Another 14\% of retail sales comes from solid edibles (chocolate bars, cookies, etc), liquid edibles (soda and other infused drinks), and infused mix (e.g. pre-roll joints infused with concentrates). The remaining categories make up less than 2\% of total revenue; these are topical products (e.g. creams and ointments), packaged marijuana mix (e.g. pre-roll joints), capsules, tinctures, transdermal patches, sample jar, and suppository. Retailers are located in 37 counties while wholesalers are located in 35 counties in Washington state (the state has 39 counties in total). Due to restrictions on the number of licenses a firm can hold, the vast majority of retail and wholesale establishments are standalone firms. Over the entire sample period, the data contain \$4.47 and \$1.46 billion in retail and wholesale sales, respectively. Note that all retail cannabis sales are subject to a 37\% excise tax, and retail prices and revenues reported in this paper are tax-inclusive. In contrast, there is no tax on wholesale transactions.

To estimate pass-through elasticities I follow previous studies (e.g. \cite{renkin2020,leung2021}) and define the dependent variable as the natural logarithm of the monthly establishment-level price index:
\begin{equation}
    \pi_{j,t} = \ln I_{j,t}, \, \text{with} \, I_{j,t} = \prod_c I_{c,j,t}^{\omega_{c,j,y(t)}}
\end{equation}
$\pi_{j,t}$ is the inflation rate for establishment $j$ in month $t$; $I_{j,t}$ is an establishment-level Lowe price index that aggregates price changes across product subcategories $c$; the weight $\omega_{c,j,y(t)}$ is the revenue share of subcategory $c$ in establishment $j$ during the calendar year of month $t$.\footnote{As pointed out by\cite{renkin2020}, price indexes are often constructed using lagged quantity weights. Since product turnover is high in cannabis retail, lagged weights would limit the number of products used in constructing the price indexes. Thus, contemporaneous weights are used.} To limit the potential impact of outliers, I trim inflation rates above the 99.5th and below the 0.5th percentile of the monthly distribution in my main specification (results are robust to keeping outliers). I describe the establishment-level price index in more detail in Appendix \ref{appendix:a}.

%% =========================================================
\subsection{Wage data}
%% =========================================================

My identification strategy rests on the idea that minimum wage hikes affect establishments with a high share of minimum wage workers more than those with a low share. Since wages are not observable at the establishment level, I follow previous studies and use geographic variation in the minimum wage bite as a proxy (see e.g. \cite{card1992}). I define bite as the share of FTE workers in a county-subsector earning below the new minimum wage two quarters prior to the hike. The subsectors are based on the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) which explicitly spells out classification for cannabis establishments of various types. NAICS subsector 453 ("Miscellaneous store retailers") captures all cannabis retailers since NAICS 453998, a component of that subsector, includes "All Other Miscellaneous Store Retailers (except Tobacco Stores), including Marijuana Stores, Medicinal and Recreational" \citep{naics2007}. At the wholesale level, NAICS 111 ("Crop production") captures cannabis producers, since NAICS 111998 includes "All Other Miscellaneous Crop Farming, including Marijuana Grown in an Open Field" and NAICS 111419 includes "Other Food Crops Grown Under Cover, including Marijuana Grown Under Cover" \citep{naics2007}. A slight complication is the fact that in addition to growing cannabis, most producers are also processors (i.e. producer-processors). Processing falls under NAICS 424 which includes as a subcomponent "Other Farm Product Raw Material Merchant Wholesalers, including Marijuana Merchant wholesalers" (NAICS 424590). However, NAICS classifies an establishment based on its primary activity, meaning that a wholesaler only belongs to NAICS 424 if its revenue from processing activities exceeds that of its own crop production \citep{naics2007}. Table \ref{tab:2} shows that unprocessed "Usable Marijuana" accounts for the majority of revenue for producer-processors, indicating that producer-processors belong to NAICS 111.\footnote{\cite{miller2022} show that when cannabis was first legalized, the establishment count for NAICS 1114 in Washington increased by a similar count as the number of wholesale cannabis licenses. Moreover, the state saw a proportional increase in the number of workers in the sector and the total wages paid \citep{miller2022}.} Note that since very few establishments have only a processor license, I drop these from my sample.

In Appendix \ref{appendix:d.3}, I construct an alternative bite variable at the five-digit NAICS level and show that my results do not depend on the chosen level of industrial classification. Still, bite at the three-digit subsector level carries several advantages that make it preferable for the main analysis. First, cannabis producer-processors belong to different four-digit NAICS industries depending on whether they grow indoors or outdoors. Since I do not observe whether a given producer-processor grows indoors or outdoors, I would have to assume that all establishments are either indoor or outdoor growers, which increases measurement error. In contrast, the three-digit NAICS subsector captures both indoor and outdoor producer-processors and thereby avoids such measurement error. Second, with more detailed NAICS codes, the bite variable does not clear the Census Bureau's data privacy filters for several counties, resulting in a reduced sample size. I discuss these issues in more detail in appendix \ref{appendix:b}.

By defining bite at the level of the three-digit industry subsector, I assume that variation in wages at cannabis establishments resembles variation in the corresponding industry subsectors. I document several facts to support this assumption. First, in Appendix \ref{appendix:g} I show that average wages for cannabis retailers and wholesalers are very similar to those in the corresponding NAICS subsectors.\footnote{I also find that average wages are homogenous among the industries contained in the relevant NAICS subsectors.} Moreover, for both the cannabis industry and the NAICS subsectors, average wages are remarkably close to the wage floor imposed by the minimum wage.\footnote{For wholesalers, the gross wage is 5\%-10\% above the minimum wage for the years 2018 to 2020, while for retailers it ranges from 15\%-19\% above the minimum wage. See appendix \ref{appendix:g}.} Thus, to the extent that the wage distributions differ between cannabis establishments and their NAICS subsectors, these differences should come from the upper part of the wage distributions rather than the lower part (since outliers are bounded from below by the minimum wage but unbounded from above). Furthermore, my regressions control for local labor market conditions (county-level average wage and unemployment) as well as county or establishment fixed effects. This implies that any remaining measurement error is likely to be random, and hence will lead to conservative treatment effect estimates. Finally, the dynamic difference-in-differences framework allows me to closely examine treatment effect timing, meaning that for estimates to be biased, non-random measurement error would have to induce bias in the exact period that the minimum wage hike occurs. I view such a scenario as unlikely.

I obtained the bite data from the Washington Employment Security Department (ESD) which collects data on employment and wages in industries covered by unemployment insurance (about 95\% of U.S. jobs).\footnote{The ESD data feeds into the better-known Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW), a federal/state cooperative program that measures employment and wages in industries covered by unemployment insurance at the detailed-industry-by-county level.} A similar dataset has been used in the recent minimum wage literature (see e.g. \cite{dube2016,renkin2020,leung2021}). It is important to note that, while the treatment intensity varies across time and space in my sample, the timing of the treatment does not vary (i.e. no staggered treatment). Thus, the six minimum wage hikes (three citywide and three statewide hikes) in the sample period amount to three minimum wage events, each spaced 12 months apart. Figure \ref{fig:2} depicts the average bite in the sample period for the NAICS subsectors containing cannabis establishments, by county. The figure shows substantial heterogeneity in bite across counties but also across the two subsectors.

\subsection{Main identification strategy}
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

My identification strategy is based on the idea that, conditional on a set of controls and fixed effects, inflation in establishments with less minimum wage exposure is a valid counterfactual for inflation in establishments with more exposure.\footnote{\cite{callaway2021} show that with continuous treatment intensities like the minimum wage bite, the DiD estimator equals a weighted average of the $2 \times 2$ DiD comparisons between pairs of treatment intensities, scaled by the differences in the intensities.} Since firms may be forward-looking in their price setting, it is important to consider anticipatory effects that may cause price increases in the months leading up to the hike. Alternatively, firms may smooth price changes across several periods before and after a hike. Since the high frequency of the price data allows me to capture such dynamics, I specify a distributed lag model with leads and lags before and after each hike. I estimate the following equation separately for retailers and wholesalers:
\begin{equation}
   \pi_{j,t} = \sum_{l =-6}^{5} \beta_l \Delta MW_{j,t-l} \times Bite_{k(j),t-l} + X_{k(j),q(t)} + \theta_k + \gamma_t + \epsilon_{j,t}.\label{eq:2}
\end{equation}
Equation \ref{eq:2} relates the monthly establishment-level inflation rate, $\pi_{j,t}$, to the treatment intensity in county $k$, which is defined as the interaction between the percent change in the minimum wage applicable to establishment $j$, $\Delta MW_{j,t-l}$, and the minimum wage bite in the county $k$ that establishment $j$ is located in, $Bite_{k(j),t-l}$.\footnote{For establishments subject to a citywide minimum wage, $\Delta MW_{j,t-l}$ corresponds to the citywide hike.} The vector of control variables, $X_{k(j),q(t)}$, contains the average wage and unemployment rate for county $k$ in the quarter $q$ of month $t$. I include these to absorb variation in cannabis prices related to local macroeconomic factors that may covary with the minimum wage bite. County fixed effects $\theta_k$ absorb county trends in cannabis prices, while time fixed effects account for industry-wide changes in cannabis prices. Since the identifying variation is at the county level, standard errors are clustered by county to allow for autocorrelation in unobservables within counties, as in \cite{bertrand2004}.

For a given minimum wage hike, the parameter $\beta_l$ measures the percent change in establishment $j$'s prices resulting from a percentage point increase in minimum wage exposure $l$ months before the minimum wage hike. Though inflation is the dependent variable, I follow \cite{renkin2020} and present the estimates as the effect of the minimum wage on the price level. I thus normalize the effect to zero in a baseline period $m$ months before each hike and report the cumulative treatment effect as the sum of $\beta_l$ at various lags: $E_L = \sum_{l=-m}^{L}\beta_l$. The pre-treatment coefficients are reported in a similar manner with $P_L = -\sum_{l=m}^{-L-1}\beta_{-l}$.\footnote{\cite{siegloth2020} show that cumulative distributed lag coefficients are numerically equivalent to the parameter estimates from an event study design with binned endpoints. Since distributed lag coefficients measure treatment effect changes, one fewer lead has to be estimated compared to an event study specification. Thus, a 12 month event window requires estimating 11 distributed lag coefficients.}

By interacting the minimum wage hike with county-level bite, my approach resembles strategies that attempt to identify effects of aggregate shocks through cross-sectional variation in the fraction affected (see e.g. \cite{bartik1991,lucca2019,goldsmith2020}). This strategy is useful in the context of Washington's cannabis market as it enables me to estimate pass-through despite the relatively small number of minimum wage hikes. Another advantage is that the estimated price level effects $E_L$ can be reformulated as pass-through elasticities at the average bite, allowing direct comparison to elasticities found in the literature on minimum wage pass-through (e.g. \cite{leung2021,renkin2020}).

An important consideration is the number of leads and lags to include in equation \ref{eq:2}. One limitation is that minimum wage hikes occur in exact 12 month intervals in the sample period, meaning event variables get highly collinear when $l$ is large. Moreover, to the extent that bite may correlate within a county across time, disentangling the effects of adjacent hikes becomes difficult when events overlap. Another issue is that the establishment panel is not balanced, meaning that changes in the underlying sample may affect estimates when $l$ is large \citep{renkin2020}. In light of these issues, I opt for a non-overlapping event window beginning six months prior and ending six months after each hike. This implicitly assumes that treatment effects do not change more than six months before or after an event. While this may seem restrictive, there is little reason to expect firms to respond to hikes more than six months before or after a minimum wage hike. Indeed, several studies find that firms adjust prices at most three months prior to an event and that effects plateau within 1-2 months after the hike \citep{renkin2020, leung2021}. Thus, restricting the effect window to a 12 month period around the hike should adequately capture the short-run impact of the minimum wage on prices.

A central concern with this research design is possible reverse causality. Since the treatment intensity is the product of two variables, $\Delta MW_{j,t-l} \times Bite_{k(j),t-l}$, the potential for reverse causality must be addressed for each of these variables in turn. $\Delta MW_{j,t-l}$ suffers from reverse causality if policymakers increase the minimum wage in response to local inflation (e.g. in an effort to keep real wages constant). This is clearly not the case with the statewide hikes in my sample, since they are either predetermined or linked to the CPI-W, a national---not local---price index.\footnote{The city of Seattle has a citywide minimum wage that could be endogenous for some businesses for event 3 (January 1st, 2021). I address this possibility in Appendix \ref{appendix:d.2} and show that the main results are robust to dropping Seattle establishments for event 3.} $Bite_{k(j),t-l}$ suffers from reverse causality if county-level inflation drives wages. To account for this possibility, I include county fixed effects to absorb county-level differences in trend inflation. Moreover, the distributed lag specification allows me to closely examine effect timing. Thus, to the extent that differences in inflation trends remain, these can be easily distinguished from treatment effects.

It is important to highlight that, when estimated for retailers, equation \ref{eq:2} uniquely identifies direct pass-through to retail prices and avoids picking up indirect pass-through effects. To see this, note that two conditions must be met for the direct pass-through estimates to be contaminated by indirect pass-through. First, retailers must purchase predominantly from wholesalers located in the retailer’s own county. Second, the bite variable for retailers must correlate with bite for wholesalers within each county.\footnote{Importantly, both conditions must hold for the direct pass-through estimates to be contaminated by indirect pass-through effects. If the first condition is met but the second condition doesn't hold, then the minimum wage effect on wholesale prices is part of the error term, but it is orthogonal to retail bite, and hence does not bias direct pass-through estimates. If the second condition holds but not the first, then wholesale bite and retail bite are not independent, but the minimum wage effect on wholesale prices in a given county has no impact on retail prices in that county since retailers don't purchase from local wholesalers.} In appendix \ref{appendix:g}, I show that the first condition does not hold since over 85\% of retailers’ wholesale purchases are from wholesalers located in other counties. The second condition also does not hold since the within-county correlation coefficient for retail and wholesale bite is 0.33, which suggests a weak relationship between wholesale and retail bites.

One limitation is that my research design cannot distinguish between the effects of minimum wage legislation and implementation. If firms are forward-looking in their price setting, prices may adjust when a minimum wage hike is announced rather than when the hike actually takes effect.\footnote{\cite{renkin2020}, for example, find that price effects occur primarily in the three months following the passage of minimum wage legislation rather than after the hike itself.} The first two hikes in my sample period were announced in 2016, two and three years prior to implementation, respectively. Because my sample runs from August 2018 through July 2021, any price effects from that announcement fall outside of the sample window and cannot be estimated. For the third event, the magnitude of the hike was announced three months prior to implementation, meaning price effects at announcement can be directly observed using my event study framework. As detailed in appendix \ref{appendix:h.3}, for both wholesale and retail prices I find no evidence of price effects at announcement but large effects at implementation. This indicates that cannabis establishments wait until the cost shock hits before adjusting prices even if they have full prior information on the magnitude of the shock.

\subsection{Direct pass-through to wholesale prices}\label{section:5.1}
%% =========================================================

I begin by estimating the effect of minimum wage hikes on wholesale prices with time FE and county FE but no county controls. A central question regarding the wholesale estimates is whether to control for a treatment-specific pre-trend, since the baseline specification reveals a clear negative trend in the pre-treatment period. Nevertheless, the trend is interrupted by a large and highly statistically significant treatment effect in the period that the minimum wage hike occurs. The contemporaneous treatment effect is then undone in subsequent periods as the pre-trend continues into the post-treatment period. Thus, while the trend does not mask the impact factor itself, failure to account for the trend changes the interpretation of the results over a longer time horizon. In appendix \ref{appendix:c} I show that the pre-trend is entirely driven by event 2, a period corresponding to a wholesale supply glut and falling wholesale prices across the industry. It is therefore plausible that for event 2 unobserved confounders covary with treatment intensity and wholesale cannabis deflation. The trend persists despite the inclusion of county FE because county means are based on all three events and the trend is only present for a single event. 

Given the statistical significance of the pre-trend, coupled with the sharp inflationary treatment effect in period $t$, I apply two common strategies to control for the pre-trend, both of which yield similar results. First, I distinguish between the three major socioeconomic regions in Washington state, where each region includes a subset of counties.\footnote{The cascade mountain range and an arid shrub-steppe create three distinct socioeconomic regions in Washington state (West, Central, and East). See Appendix \ref{appendix:i} for details.} To the extent that unobserved time-variant heterogeneity is common within these regions, region-time FE (i.e. interactions between time and region dummy variables) will control for the treatment-specific trend \citep{neumark2014}.\footnote{Unlike the baseline specification, I include county controls to further capture time-varying heterogeneity, and I exclude county FE since county means are calculated using all three events rather than just the event with the pre-trend (event 2). Results are robust to including both county FE and controls or neither.} This assumes that the proper counterfactual for inflation in counties with high treatment intensity is inflation in counties with low treatment intensity \emph{located in the same region}; that is, the identifying information comes from within-region variation in the treatment intensity. I view this as a valid assumption given the stark economic, social, and political differences across the regions.\footnote{There is a long history of attempts by the state legislature to split Washington into several states more representative of local socioeconomic conditions, including in 1915, 1985, 1991, 2005, 2015, and most recently in 2017 \citep{hallenberg2017}.} Moreover, the three regions are visible in terms of average bite in figure \ref{fig:2} (panel a). Second, I apply the two-step procedure from \cite{gb2021} and re-estimate equation \ref{eq:2} using a trend-adjusted dependent variable. Specifically, I calculate the average of the distributed lag estimates (from equation \ref{eq:2}) in the pre-baseline period and then extrapolate this pre-trend through the 12-month event window to obtain the treatment-specific linear trend $\hat \pi_{j,t}$. I then subtract the linear trend from the original dependent variable to get the trend-adjusted variable $\tilde \pi_{j,t(e)} = \pi_{j,t} - \hat \pi_{j,t}$. As argued by \cite{roth2022a}, this form of trend-adjustment assumes that the observable linear pre-trend is a valid counterfactual for the unobservable post-trend. I view this as a valid assumption since the mean observable post-treatment trend (-0.00150, p-value: 0.128) is nearly identical to---and not statistically significantly different from---the pre-treatment trend (-0.00156, p-value: 0.074).

Figure \ref{fig:5.1a} illustrates that for all three specifications (unadjusted, trend-adjusted, region-time FE) the distributed lag coefficients are not statistically significantly different from zero for $t-5$ through $t-2$, and the period $t$ treatment effects are large and not statistically significantly different from each other. Figure \ref{fig:5.1b} shows the corresponding cumulative price level effects from the three specifications. With the trend-adjusted dependent variable, the pre-treatment period shows no significant trend, while the large contemporaneous inflationary effect carries over from the unadjusted regression. At the average bite (18.63\%), a 10\% increase in the minimum wage corresponds to a 1.03\% increase in wholesale prices in period $t$. Moreover, with the trend-adjusted regression the treatment effect is no longer undone by the continuation of the pre-trend into the post-treatment period. In appendix \ref{appendix:c}, I show that this holds even if I only adjust the dependent variable for event 2 (the only event with a treatment-specific trend) and leave events 1 and 3 unadjusted. The region-time FE specification yields nearly identical results, with a flat pre-trend, a period $t$ pass-through elasticity of 1.06\%, and a permanently higher price level.\footnote{At higher lags, the price level effects from the specification with region-time FE are slightly lower than the trend-adjusted regression, but the difference is not statistically significant.} Thus, it matters little how one controls for the trend, as the linear trend-adjustment and region-time FE specifications both lead to a permanently higher wholesale price level effect.

\subsection{Direct pass-through to retail prices}\label{section:5.2}
%% =========================================================

Having obtained estimates for wholesalers, I next estimate equation \ref{eq:2} for retail establishments. In my preferred specification for retailers, I include time FE and county controls (effect sizes are similar with county FE but estimates tend to be less precise at higher lags). Figure \ref{fig:5.2} illustrates that the effects for retailers differ from those of wholesalers in several respects. First, effects for retailers show no significant pre-trend. Second, the treatment effect appears in $t-1$, i.e. one period prior to that for wholesalers, suggesting that retailers may be more forward-looking in their pricing than wholesalers.\footnote{This is consistent with the findings of \cite{hollenbeck2021}, who find that Washington's cannabis retailers in have substantial market power and behave like local monopolists. Though wholesalers' market power has not been formally investigated in the literature, a common complaint among wholesalers is their lack of market power compared to retailers \citep{lcbtier1,schaneman2021,cbt2021}.} Given the earlier treatment effect, I normalize the baseline period in $t-2$ when calculating cumulative effects on retail prices. For retailers at the average bite (17.52\%), a 10\% increase in the minimum wage corresponds to a 0.54\% jump in prices in period $t$. Thus, the treatment effect in period $t$---while still large---is about half the size of that for wholesalers. I analyze the relative magnitudes of wholesale and retail pass-through in more detail in section \ref{section:5}.

\subsection{Robustness checks} \label{section:5.3}
%% =========================================================
\subsubsection*{Alternative specifications}
The results from the previous subsection stand up to a multitude of robustness checks. In table \ref{tab:5.1}, I present several variants of my empirical strategy for wholesalers. I use the linear trend-adjustment as my preferred specification as this enables direct comparison to the indirect pass-through estimates in section \ref{section:5}. Moreover, I normalize the baseline period in $t-2$ so that cumulative wholesale and retail results line up temporally. Note that changing the baseline period has no bearing on the estimated coefficients from equation \ref{eq:2} and simply amounts to a (downward) level shift in cumulative wholesale price level effects. For the baseline specification (column 1), I estimate equation \ref{eq:2} with time and county fixed effects but no controls. Column 2 shows that the estimated effects are virtually identical when including county-level controls. Column 3 shows that effects increase when county FE are omitted. Effect sizes are not affected by winsorizing (column 4) or including outliers (column 5), but standard errors tend to be larger in both cases compared to the baseline specification.\footnote{Recall that I trim the top and bottom 0.5\% of inflation per month in the baseline specification.} Column 6 shows price level effects when region-time FE are used to control for the pre-trend rather than the linear trend adjustment. I omit county FE from column 6 since they are based on all three events and the pre-trend is only present for a single event (event 2). Instead, I include time-variant county controls as these should capture additional confounding differences in price trends during event 2.\footnote{With the region-time FE specification, results are robust to including county FE, omitting controls, and a variety of other specifications. See Appendix \ref{appendix:d}.}

As table \ref{tab:5.2} illustrates, retail price level effects are similarly stable across specifications. Column 2 shows that effect sizes do not depend on the inclusion of county controls; columns 3 and 4 show similar effect sizes with county FE and region-time FE, respectively. As with the wholesale regressions, retail price effects are not affected by winsorizing (column 5) or including outliers (column 6), though standard errors tend to be larger.

\end{table}

\subsubsection*{Further robustness checks}
Besides testing different specifications, it is also important to consider the institutional assumptions underlying identification in my research design. In this section, I discuss these assumptions and the implications of them being violated. I report results from these additional robustness checks in appendix \ref{appendix:d}. 

First, since Washington's primary crop harvesting season is in Q3---the same quarter that the bite variable is calculated---it is important to ensure that seasonal labor fluctuations do not cause endogeneity in the bite variable. Therefore, I check whether results change if the bite variable is based on Q4 wages, i.e. outside of the main harvesting season. As tables \ref{tab:d.1} and \ref{tab:d.2} illustrate, results are robust to using this alternative bite variable.

I also consider the possibility that firms may not fully comply with the new minimum wage. If that were the case, the bite variable would not accurately measure minimum wage exposure since higher bite would not translate into a larger cost increase for firms. To account for such non-compliance, I redefine the bite variable as the difference between bite two quarters before and one quarter after the hike,
\begin{equation}
    \Delta Bite_{k(j)} = Bite_{k(j),Q3,y}-Bite_{k(j),Q1,y+1}
\end{equation}
This effectively nets out non-compliance at the county level. Tables \ref{tab:d.1} and \ref{tab:d.2} show that results are robust to this alternative bite variable.

An obvious concern is that policymakers may set minimum wage policy according to local price trends. If that were the case, then the treatment intensity would be endogenous due to reverse causality. Luckily, this concern does not apply to the statewide hikes in the sample since they are either predetermined (events 1 and 2) or linked to a national price index (event 3). However, the city of Seattle has a citywide minimum wage that could, under certain circumstances, be endogenous for some businesses in event 3. In Appendix \ref{appendix:d.2}, I consider the scenarios under which Seattle's minimum wage could be endogenous and show that the main results are unchanged when Seattle establishments are dropped from the sample for event 3.

Next, to ensure that my results are not driven by market entry or exit, I restrict the sample to establishments that are present at least 10 months for a given 12-month event. Results are robust to using this more balanced sample.

Since the establishment-level price indexes are constructed using annual product and subcategory weights, the weights change at the same time as the minimum wage hike. To ensure that effect sizes are not an artifact of this weighting scheme, I use alternate weights based on the fiscal year starting in July and ending in June each year (i.e. six months offset from the weights in the baseline model).\footnote{For the weights to cause endogeneity, the change in product and subcategory revenue shares within an establishment would need to covary with bite. I view this as unlikely.} Results are unaffected by this alternate weighting scheme.

Next, I show that results do not rely on interacting bite with the size of the minimum wage hike (i.e. I set treatment intensity equal to minimum wage bite itself). 

It is also important to test whether the results are impacted by the level of industry classification used to define the bite variable. Therefore, I construct an alternative bite variable based on 5-digit NAICS codes to show that the main results do not depend on the level of industrial classification used.\footnote{Though based on a more detailed level of industry classification, the alternate bite variable contains measurement error of a different sort, meaning it is not apparent that it is a better measure of minimum wage exposure. See appendix \ref{appendix:d} for details.}

\section{Indirect pass-through to retail prices}\label{section:5}
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Since wholesalers occupy the upstream portion of the supply chain, the pass-through estimates from equation \ref{eq:2} provide a complete measure of wholesale price adjustment in response to the minimum wage.\footnote{In practice, wholesalers may also be subject to minimum wage pass-through from their input suppliers. However, wholesale inputs like hydroponic systems, grow lights, and raw materials can be purchased from suppliers outside of Washington state. Therefore, minimum wage pass-through to wholesale input prices is likely small. To simplify the analysis, I do not consider indirect pass-through for wholesalers.} For retail prices, however, equation 2 only estimates direct pass-through and therefore fails to capture indirect pass-through. Thus, an analysis based solely on equation 2 may not reflect the true impact of the minimum wage on retail prices. To capture both direct and indirect effects, I estimate the following equation for retailers only:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:5}
   \pi_{r,t} = \sum_{l =-6}^{5} \beta_l \Delta MW_{r,t-l} \times Bite_{k(r),t-l} + \sum_{l =-6}^{5} \psi_l JB_{r,P,t-l} + X_{k(r),q(t)} + \theta_k(r) + \gamma_t + \epsilon_{r,t}.
\end{equation}
In contrast to equation \ref{eq:2}, equation \ref{eq:5} contains not one, but two treatment variables. The first, $\Delta MW_{r,t-l} \times Bite_{k(r),t-l}$, is identical to that from equation \ref{eq:2} except that the index $r$ replaces $j$ to emphasize that the bite corresponds to retailer $r$. The second treatment variable, $JB_{r,P,t-l}$, measures the weighted average minimum wage exposure of the wholesalers that retailer $r$ purchases from. $JB_{r,P,t-l}$ is calculated as follows:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:6}
    JB_{r,P,t-l} = \sum_{p = s}^{S} \alpha_{r,p} \Delta MW_{p,t-l} \times \sum_{p=s}^{S} \alpha_{r,p} Bite_{k(p),t-l}
\end{equation}
Here, $\Delta MW_{p,t-l}$ is the size of the minimum wage hike for wholesaler $p$; $\alpha_{r,p}$ is the average share of retailer $r$'s wholesale expenditures going to wholesaler $p$ from $t-4$ through $t-2$, i.e. in the months leading up to the hike; and $Bite_{k(p),t-l}$ is the minimum wage bite for the county $k$ that wholesaler $p$ is located in.\footnote{Note that a retailer and a wholesaler located in the same county will have different bites since bite is calculated at the industry subsector level.} Thus, the first term in equation \ref{eq:6} measures the average minimum wage hike for the set of wholesalers that retailer $r$ purchases from, while the second term measures the average bite for that same set of wholesalers.\footnote{One could instead directly interact wholesale expenditure share, hike size, and wholesaler bite as follows: $JB_{r,P,t-l} = \sum_{p = s}^{S} \alpha_{r,p} \Delta MW_{p,t-l} Bite_{k(p),t-l}$. Results are virtually identical under this definition of joint bite. However, the advantage of averaging before interacting (as in equation \ref{eq:6}) is that the coefficient $\psi_l$ can be interpreted as a pass-through elasticity.} It is worth emphasizing that $\alpha_{r,p}$ contains no time index and is therefore fixed for each retailer-event. In practice, retailers may react to the increase in wholesale prices by recalibrating their wholesale bundles (e.g. by substituting out of high pass-through products), in which case $\alpha_{r,p}$ would change from month to month. However, allowing $\alpha_{r,p}$ to vary within an event could result in reverse causality since a retailer's wholesale substitution patterns may reflect its own inflation. Defining $\alpha_{r,p}$ as the average expenditure share from $t-4$ through $t-2$ avoids this endogeneity, particularly since the results from the previous section indicate that wholesale price effects do not emerge until $t-1$. In other words, the expenditure shares $\alpha_{r,p}$ are based on a time frame prior to the emergence of the wholesale cost shock. %By including $JB_{r,P,t-l}$, equation \ref{eq:5} therefore separately identifies direct and indirect pass-through. 

As an alternative to the joint bite variable in equation \ref{eq:6}, one could use wholesalers' geographic proximity as an instrument for retailers' exposure to pass-through to wholesale prices. This assumes that retailers purchase more from wholesalers located nearby than those further away. However, I find little evidence supporting this assumption. Instead, a large share of retailers' wholesale purchases are from wholesalers located in other parts of the state (see appendix \ref{appendix:g}). Thus, a distance-based instrument is unlikely to capture retailers' exposure to pass-through to wholesale prices.

A key assumption is that equation \ref{eq:5} separately identifies direct and indirect pass-through. One way to test this is to examine whether the estimates for $\beta_l$ (the direct pass-through estimates) are affected by the inclusion of joint bite as an additional variable. If estimates for direct pass-through were to change, this would cast doubt on the main identification strategy and, by extension, the results from the previous section. I show in appendix \ref{appendix:d} that direct pass-through estimates are unaffected by the inclusion of joint wholesale bite.

In equation \ref{eq:5}, the indirect pass-through rate flows from the parameter $\psi_l$. For a given minimum wage hike, $\psi_l$ measures the percent change in retailer $r$'s prices resulting from a percentage point increase in indirect minimum wage exposure $l$ months before the minimum wage hike. As with direct pass-through, indirect pass-through is best illustrated in terms of cumulative price level effects. Therefore, I again normalize the effect to zero in a baseline period $m$ months before each hike and report the cumulative treatment effect as the sum of $\psi_l$ at various lags: $E_L = \sum_{l=-m}^{L}\psi_l$. I report the pre-treatment coefficients in a similar manner, with $P_L = -\sum_{l=m}^{-L-1}\psi_{-l}$. 

Figure \ref{fig:6.2a} illustrates that the time path of indirect pass-through to retail prices is remarkably similar to the direct pass-through to wholesale price estimates from the previous section. The figure reveals a downward-sloping pre-trend interrupted by an inflationary shock in the treatment period, followed by a continuation of the pre-trend into the post-treatment period. As in section \ref{section:5.1}, to quantify the pre-treatment trend I take the average of the distributed lag coefficients for the pre-baseline period, $\bar{\hat{\psi}}_{pre} = 1/4 \sum_{l=2}^{5} \hat{\psi}_{-l}$. I find no statistically significant difference between $\bar{\hat{\psi}}_{pre}$ and the bite-specific trend for pass-through to wholesale prices.\footnote{$\bar{\hat{ \psi}}_{pre} = -.00102$ ($90\%$ confidence interval: $-0.00329$ to $0.00126$), which overlaps with the pre-trend for pass-through to wholesale prices, $\bar{\hat{ \beta}}_{pre} = -0.00197$ ($90\%$ confidence interval: $-0.00367$ to $-0.00026$). See appendix \ref{appendix:c} for details.} Accordingly, I apply the \cite{gb2021} procedure and re-estimate equation \ref{eq:5} with the dependent variable adjusted for the joint-bite-specific trend.\footnote{Unlike in section \ref{section:4}, region-time FE cannot be used to control for the pre-trend since the dependent variable and joint bite stem from different sets of establishments (retailers and wholesalers, respectively). Moreover, as shown in appendix \ref{appendix:g}, retailers purchase a large share of products from wholesalers located in other regions of the state, meaning region-time FE based on a retailer's region will not capture the joint bite-specific trend.} 

Note that, while it is informative to compare the time paths of indirect pass-through to retail prices and direct pass-through to wholesale prices, the implied pass-through elasticities are not directly comparable. This stems from the fact that retail prices are higher than wholesale prices, meaning a given pass-through elasticity corresponds to a much larger absolute pass-through (in dollar terms) to retail prices than to wholesale prices. In contrast, direct and indirect pass-through to retail prices are directly comparable because they correspond to a single price level (i.e. the retail price level).

In table \ref{tab:6.1}, I report cumulative effects of indirect pass-through to retail prices relative to the normalized baseline period two months prior to the hike. For the baseline specification, at the average joint bite (18.14\%), a 10\% minimum wage hike corresponds to a 1.22\% increase in retail price level two months after the hike.

\centering
\caption{Minimum wage elasticity of the price level}
\label{tab:6.2}
\include{tables_no_10_mo_restriction/pass_through_elasticities}
\end{table}

To facilitate comparison, table \ref{tab:6.2} summarizes the main pass-through effects for wholesale and retail prices. Several facts stand out. First, the magnitude of direct pass-through to retail prices (0.7\%) is in line with existing studies. \cite{leung2021}, for example, finds a minimum wage pass-through elasticity of 0.6-0.8\% for grocery store prices in the U.S.\footnote{Using different scanner data from the U.S., \cite{renkin2020} find a minimum wage pass-through elasticity of 0.36\% for grocery store prices.} 

Second, for retail prices, the indirect pass-through elasticity exceeds the direct pass-through elasticity by a factor of 1.8. For retail stores in other sectors (e.g. grocery stores, general merchandise stores, etc) the cost of goods sold (COGS) typically makes up a larger share of retail variable costs compared to labor costs. If this applies to cannabis retailers as well, then it is reasonable for indirect pass-through to exceed direct pass-through to retail prices.\footnote{For example, \cite{renkin2020} find that COGS account for more than 80\% of retailers' variable costs.} To quantify the relative importance of labor and COGS for cannabis retailers, I use aggregate payroll data on cannabis retailers from the Washington state ESD for the years 2018-2020.\footnote{Data for 2021 is not available. I compute COGS directly from the cannabis traceability data.} I find that cannabis retailers' annual COGS expenditure exceeds labor expenditure by a factor of 2.1 (see appendix \ref{appendix:e}). In other words, indirect and direct pass-through elasticities to retail prices are in line with the relative importance of wholesale and labor costs in cannabis retailers' variable costs.\footnote{Note that labor costs and COGS comprise the two largest parts of retailers' variable costs \citep{renkin2020}}

Third, the total minimum wage elasticity of the retail price level, which is obtained by summing the direct and indirect elasticities, is 1.92\%---much larger than that from direct pass-through alone.\footnote{Note that the direct and indirect pass-through elasticities are computed with different average bites. One could instead compute both elasticities from a single average bite value, but this would be an out of sample prediction for at least one of the elasticities. Since the average bite for indirect pass-through (18.14\%) is similar to that for direct pass-through (19.43\%), I compute the elasticities using their own average bite values. The total elasticity is then the sum of the direct and indirect elasticities.} Thus, failing to account for indirect pass-through dramatically underestimates the minimum wage effect on retail cannabis prices.

\section{Dissecting the price effects}\label{section:6}
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Effects on markups over marginal input cost}

In this subsection, I estimate the impact of minimum wage hikes on retail markups over marginal input cost (MIC) with the aim of determining the degree of wholesale cost pass-through to retail prices. I estimate the following equation for retail establishments:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:7}
   \Delta \mu_{r,t} = \sum_{l =-6}^{5} \beta_l \Delta MW_{r,t-l} \times Bite_{k(r),t-l} + \sum_{l =-6}^{5} \psi_l JB_{r,P,t-l} + X_{k(r),q(t)} + \theta_k(r) + \gamma_t + \epsilon_{r,t}.
\end{equation}
The dependent variable, $\Delta \mu_{r,t}$, is the monthly percent change in MIC markup for establishment $r$ (see appendix \ref{appendix:f} for details on the markup index). Table \ref{tab:6.3} displays the estimated markup effects and compares them to the estimates for direct and indirect pass-through to retail prices found in sections \ref{section:4}-\ref{section:5}. Comparing $E_4$ in columns 1 and 2 reveals that the direct effect on the markup is very similar to the direct effect on the price level. This is not surprising, since direct pass-through to prices entails a price increase that is---by definition---independent of wholesale costs. In contrast, columns 3 and 4 reveal a large indirect effect on the price level in $E_4$ (significant at the 10\% level) but a small and statistically insignificant indirect markup effect. This indicates no markup adjustment to the wholesale cost shock on the part of retailers and implies a full pass-through of the wholesale cost shock to retail prices.

\begin{table}[!htbp] 
\centering
\caption{Minimum wage effects on retail prices and markups over marginal input cost}
\label{tab:6.3}
\include{tables_no_10_mo_restriction/markup}
\end{table}

\subsection{Price effects by scale of production}

One concern in the cannabis industry is that rules governing production capacity for producer-processors have created an uneven playing field, and a common complaint is that small producer-processors operate on very slim margins while large establishments enjoy a higher degree of market power \citep{lcbtier1}. If larger producer-processors have more market power, then they may be able to absorb cost shocks along other margins (e.g. by adjusting profits), in which case pass-through elasticities may decrease with establishment size. Therefore, in this section I test for heterogeneous pass-through across different establishment sizes.

Producer-processor (i.e. wholesale) licenses are based on a three-tier system governing the square footage of plant canopy an establishment is legally permitted to operate. Tier 1 producer-processors can grow up to 2,000 square feet of plant canopy, tier 2 can grow up to 10,000 square feet, while tier 3 can operate up to 30,000 square feet. Though retail cannabis licenses have no such restrictions, it is nevertheless informative to investigate heterogeneous pass-through at the retail level as well. Therefore, I sort retail establishments into tertiles for each event based on total revenue during the event window. I estimate equation \ref{eq:5} separately for each sub-sample and report the results in table \ref{tab:6.4}. Columns 1-3 show that pass-through to wholesale prices is monotonically decreasing with establishment size: small producer-processors exhibit much larger price level effects than medium-sized producer-processors, while effects for large producer-processors are close to zero and statistically insignificant.\footnote{The difference between effect sizes for small and large producer-processors is statistically significant for $E_2$ but not for $E_0$ or $E_4$.} I interpret this as evidence that small producer-processors may be less able to absorb the minimum wage cost shock via other margins of adjustment (e.g. by adjusting profits) compared to large producer-processors. %This could be due to low market power among small establishments, a common compliant among tier 1 producer-processors (see e.g. \cite{lcbtier1}). Unfortunately, the data do not contain information on firm-level profits or employment, meaning it is not possible to answer this definitively.

For retailers, results are less clear cut, as direct price level effects in $E_0$ are also monotonically decreasing with establishment size, but at higher lags medium-sized establishments have the largest effects (columns 4-6). Nevertheless, small retailers have consistently greater price level effects than large retailers (though the difference is not statistically significant). For indirect pass-through, medium establishments again have the largest effects (columns 7-9), but there is no systematic pattern when comparing only small and large establishments. More generally, direct and indirect pass-through to retail prices exhibit an inverse U-shape at higher lags. However, without information on the curvature of demand and the slope of the marginal cost curve, I caution against over-interpreting these results.

\section{Other margins of adjustment to minimum wage hikes}\label{section:7}
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

While the primary focus of this paper is the price level effects of minimum wage hikes, firms may adjust to the cost shock along other margins as well. In this section, I examine several other possible channels for firm adjustment.

%% =========================================================
\subsection{Employment effects}
%% =========================================================

In this section, I examine the employment effects of minimum wage hikes during the sample period. Since employment information is not available for cannabis establishments, I use monthly employment data from the QCEW at the 5-digit NAICS industry level. I estimate the following distributed lag equation: 
\begin{equation}
   \Delta \ln Emp_{k,t} = \sum_{l =-6}^{5} \beta_l \Delta MW_{t-l} \times Bite_{k,t-l} + X_{k,q(t)} + \theta_k + \gamma_t + \epsilon_{k,t}.\label{eq:8}
\end{equation}
The dependent variable is the first difference of (log) county employment at the 5-digit industry level.\footnote{Cannabis retailers belong to NAICS 45399 ("all other miscellaneous store retailers"). Cannabis producer-processors that grow indoors belong to NAICS 11141 ("food crops grown under cover"). I do not estimate employment effects for the NAICS industry containing outdoor growers because the majority of producer-processors in Washington state grow indoors.} The treatment intensity $\sum_{l =-6}^{5} \beta_l \Delta MW_{t-l} \times Bite_{k,t-l}$ is the same as in the previous sections but for one difference: Since equation \ref{eq:8} is at the county level, $\Delta MW$ does not include citywide minimum wage hikes. Table \ref{tab:j.1} in Appendix \ref{appendix:j} shows that employment effects are mostly insignificant.\footnote{Column 1 shows a positive effect that is significant at the 10\% level. However, this effect disappears when including region-time fixed effects, which is an important robustness check in the minimum wage-employment context (see \citep{reich2018}).} Overall, these results suggest that the minimum wage has no effect on employment for cannabis establishments. However, I caution against over-interpreting these results. Since cannabis workers are a subset of employees at the 5-digit NAICS level, one cannot definitively rule out employment effects at cannabis establishments.

%% =========================================================
\subsection{Demand feedback}
%% =========================================================

This paper treats minimum wage hikes as a cost shock to cannabis establishments. However, it is conceivable that by raising the incomes of low-wage workers, minimum wage hikes may affect demand for cannabis products. This in turn may contribute to the retail price effects found in the main part of the paper.\footnote{\cite{leung2021} finds more than full minimum wage pass-through to grocery store prices in the U.S. and attributes part of the price effect to demand feedback.} It is particularly important to investigate this channel in the context of the cannabis industry, since retail cannabis employees may be avid cannabis consumers themselves. To test for demand effects I estimate the following variant of equation \ref{eq:2} for retailers:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:9}
   \Delta Q_{r,t} = \sum_{l =-6}^{5} \beta_l \Delta MW_{r,t-l} \times Bite_{k(r),t-l} + \theta_k(r) + \gamma_t + \epsilon_{r,t}.
\end{equation}
The dependent variable is the natural logarithm of the monthly establishment-level quantity index, which is constructed similarly to the price index used in the previous sections. My results show that minimum wage hikes have no effect on cannabis consumption in the nine month period spanning $t-2$ through $t+6$ (see table \ref{tab:j.2} in appendix \ref{appendix:j}). However, a positive pre-trend is found for the periods $t-6$ through $t-2$. This pre-trend, coupled with the flat treatment effects after $t-2$, suggest that the results may not be very accurate and preclude a strong conclusion on the effects of minimum wage hikes on cannabis demand.

\subsection{Productivity: a discussion}

Productivity is another channel through which the minimum wage may affect firms and workers, and several mechanisms have been proposed in the literature. Since the minimum wage reduces the price of physical capital relative to labor, firms may substitute machinery for workers. \cite{mayernis2018} find evidence of this in the context of the 2004 minimum wage reform in China. However, I view this scenario as unlikely in the cannabis context, since cannabis production leaves little scope for technological adjustments. Most producer-processors grow cannabis indoors in a setting averse to mechanization, and most cannabis is harvested, dried, and trimmed by hand to produce aesthetically pleasing, higher-priced buds \citep{miller2022}.

\cite{ku2022} proposes a different mechanism through which the minimum wage might affect productivity: if the minimum wage causes workers to anticipate potential layoffs, workers may increase their individual effort to avoid being laid off. Alternatively, firms may substitute out of low-skilled workers and into high-skilled workers. I do not observe employment at the establishment level so I cannot test either of these mechanisms. 

The cost shock could also induce firms to adopt better management or organizational practices, which has been shown to increase productivity without the need for physical capital investment \citep{bloom2013,atkin2017}. Unfortunately, I do not observe worker or firm productivity and therefore cannot rule out this channel.

\section{Discussion and conclusion}\label{section:8}
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this paper, I study the effects of minimum wage increases on wholesale and retail prices in Washington state's legal recreational cannabis industry. I use scanner-level data to estimate pass-through rates across six minimum wage hikes from 2018 to 2021. When ignoring pass-through to wholesale prices, I find that a 10\% increase in the minimum wage raises retail prices by 0.7\%. Yet, I also find substantial pass-through to wholesale prices: a 10\% increase in the minimum wage raises wholesale prices by 1.79\%. The existence of pass-through to wholesale prices implies that retailers face a wholesale cost shock in addition to the labor cost shock. When the empirical model is augmented to account for the wholesale cost shock, retail pass-through elasticities more double to 1.92\%. I find that retailers do not adjust markups to wholesale pass-through, indicating a full pass-through of the wholesale cost shock to retail prices. Moreover, pass-through to wholesale prices decreases with the scale of production, which suggests that large wholesalers may adjust to the labor cost shock along other margins.

One issue with this type of analysis is the degree to which results from one industry can be used to infer price dynamics in other industries. Some of the characteristics that make Washington's cannabis industry an ideal laboratory for studying minimum wage pass-through also set the industry apart. The dominance of small-scale indoor cultivation, along with rules governing the scale of cultivation, mean that cannabis production is likely to be  more labor intensive than other agricultural industries (I discuss this topic in appendix \ref{appendix:g}). Similarly, since consumers must individually consult with a budtender to purchase products suggests that cannabis retail stores are more labor intensive than other types of retail outlets. Accordingly, the labor share of variable cost is expected to be higher, and hence, the cost shock imposed by the minimum wage may be larger compared to other industries. Therefore, I view my direct pass-through estimates as an upper-bound compared to less labor intensive industries.

Another difference to other industries is that the cannabis market operates under statewide autarky. This implies that cannabis retailers may be constrained in their response to the wholesale cost shock since the set of substitutable wholesale products is partly determined by geography. In contrast, retailers in other industries can leverage interstate trade networks to substitute out of products with high pass-through to wholesale prices. Therefore, I view my indirect retail pass-through estimates as more applicable for industries with home bias (e.g. grocery stores), but potentially less applicable for industries with a high degree of geographic substitutability along the supply chain (e.g. drugstores and general merchandise stores).\footnote{Using the 2007 Commodity Flow Survey, \cite{renkin2020} provide evidence of substantial home bias in US grocery consumption.}

Nevertheless, the findings in this paper highlight the importance of examining the entire supply chain---beyond the final point of sale---when investigating the product market effects of minimum wage hikes. In particular, studies that only look at retail scanner data may underestimate the true effect of minimum wages on retail prices.

\subsection{Cannabis labor}

\subsubsection*{The labor intensive nature of cannabis}

Cannabis is a labor intensive industry. Most cannabis plants are dioecious, meaning there are separate male and female plants, and buds with high concentrations of psychoactive compounds are exclusively produced by unpollinated female plants. Therefore, unlike other dioecious crops like fruits or nuts, where males and females must co-mingle, cannabis producers must carefully identify and remove any male cannabis plants from the growing area, since even a single male plant can pollinate---and thereby ruin---an entire crop.\footnote{Since pollination leads to seed production and inferior buds, the producer is typically forced to discard the entire crop if it becomes cross-pollinated.} This laborious process is compounded by a heavy reliance on indoor cultivation, which is generally considered to be more labor intensive than outdoor production.\footnote{Indoor cultivation offers stable growing conditions, year-round harvests, and enables more potent buds \cite{aiz2016}.} When cannabis plant buds have matured, they are harvested and trimmed by hand, a process which takes up to six hours per pound \citep{cervantes2006}. Trimming is particularly labor intensive, as workers use hand trimmers to manually shape the harvested buds. Other tasks like filling pre-roll shakers are also largely done by hand.\footnote{As noted by \citep{miller2021}, growers have shied away from mechanized trimmers since hand-trimming allows producers to extract higher quality buds and fetch higher prices from consumers.} \par

Cannabis is labor intensive at the retail level as well. Inside every store, a service counter forms a physical barrier between the customer and the products, and the customer can only make a purchase with the help of a qualified sales representative known as a `budtender'. Budtenders are only permitted to service one customer at a time, and since each consultation can take several minutes depending on the customer's needs, most retailers employ several budtenders per shift to boost sales volume. These rules are stringently enforced and retailers are subject to frequent compliance audits. Penalties for violations include civil and criminal liability for firm owners, making violations a relatively rare phenomenon \citep{hansen2021}. Taken together, these regulations suggest that cannabis retailers have high labor intensity compared to similarly-sized retailers in other sectors \citep{miller2021}.\par


\subsubsection*{Wages in cannabis}

Wages in cannabis are lower than in other industries in Washington state. In 2016, the mean wage for cannabis businesses was less than the overall mean wage in all 36 counties with a cannabis business \citep{Hoagland2017,esd2016}. The same pattern held for median wages \citep{Hoagland2017,esd2016}. This should come as no surprise: at the retail level, budtending is a low-skill job that requires no formal education, while the same holds for most jobs at the producer-processor level.\footnote{Producer-processors typically employ a small number of "master growers" who are trained in cultivation, along with a much larger number of low-wage employees engaged in garden labor (e.g. harvesting, drying, trimming), filling pre-rolls, packaging, delivery and other manual labor tasks.} Table \ref{tab:g.1} shows the average annual wage for cannabis establishments for the years 2018-2020 and compares it to the statewide average for all industries. For wholesalers, the annual gross wage gap to NAICS 111 is less than 3\%; for retailers, the gap to NAICS 453 ranges from 8\% to 11\%. When converted to hourly wages (assuming 2,080 hours per year), the wage gap between cannabis wholesalers and NAICS 111 ranges from \$0.22 to \$0.37 per hour. For cannabis retailers, the gap is slightly larger: on average, cannabis employees earned between \$0.95 and \$1.58 less per hour than than NAICS 453, which amounts to 8\% to 11\% difference.

\subsection{Variable cost structure for cannabis retailers}
% -------------------------------------------

\label{appendix:e}
This section provides information on the back-of-the-envelope comparison between cannabis retailers' wholesale expenditures and labor expenditures. Note that in most retail settings, cost of goods sold (COGS) and labor cost together account for 99\% of variable cost \citep{renkin2020}. Other expenditures like packaging and transport costs typically make up less than 1\% of variable cost.

\end{table}

\newpage
% -------------------------------------------
\subsection{The geography of wholesale costs}
% -------------------------------------------

Table \ref{tab:h.1} shows the percentage of retailers' wholesale costs in relation to a wholesaler's geographic location. Column 1 shows that only 5.22\% of retailers' wholesale expenditures go to wholesalers located in the same city as the retailer. Column 2 shows that less than 15\% goes to wholesalers in the same county as the retailer. For column 3, I sort counties into their respective 3-digit zip codes---retailers are located in 14 3-digit zip codes (compared to 37 counties). Column 3 shows that less than 16\% of wholesale cost goes to wholesalers located in the same 3-digit zip code. Next, I sort counties into three regions (west, central, east), defined by well-established topographic and economic boundaries. Column 4 shows that 62\% of wholesale sales go to retailers in another region. Column 5 looks at the subset of establishments located in the west and east regions of the state, thus dropping wholesalers in the central region. The east and west regions are non-contiguous and located on opposite sides of the state. For establishments located in these two regions, 23.9\% of wholesale sales go to retailers located in the other region, that is to say, retailers on the opposite side of the state. Because the majority of establishments are located in the west and east regions, this share amounts to 21.4\% of all of wholesale expenditures.

\section{Construction of establishment-level indexes}
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{appendix:a}
\label{appendix:f}
% -----------------------------------------
\subsection{Establishment-level price indexes}
% -----------------------------------------

My empirical analysis uses traceability data provided by the data analytic firm Top Shelf Data (TSD), which ingests the raw tracking data from the Liquor and Cannabis Board (LCB) and matches it with additional product information. Note that the raw tracking data from the LCB includes each product's SKU, but TSD does not report this. Instead, each product is identified by a unique combination of five elements: retailer-wholesaler-category-unit weight-product name. For products with no unit weight (such as liquid edibles), the first four elements identify the product. TSD then calculates the average price of product $i$ at retail establishment $j$ in month $t$ as
\begin{equation}
    P_{i,j,t} = \frac{TR_{i,j,t}}{TQ_{i,j,t}}.
\end{equation}
 where $TR_{i,j,t}$ is the revenue from product $i$ at retailer $j$ in month $t$, and $TQ_{i,j,t}$ is total quantity.
 
 To construct establishment-level price indexes, I employ a two step process similar to that used by \cite{renkin2020}. In the first step, I use $P_{i,j,t}$ to construct a geometric mean of month-over-month changes for product subcategory $c$ at establishment $j$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:a.1}
    I_{c,j,t} = \prod_i \left( \frac{P_{i,j,t}}{P_{i,j,t-1}}\right)^{\omega_{i,c,y(t)}}
\end{equation}
where each subcategory is a unique category-unit weight combination.\footnote{Since unit weight is a major component of cannabis product differentiation (akin to volume in beverage sales), the majority of sales contain information on unit weight. Therefore, in the first step of the establishment index, I choose to aggregate at category-unit weight level rather than the category level.} For example, 1.0g usable marijuana and 2.0 gram usable marijuana are separate subcategories. Following \cite{renkin2020}, the weight $\omega_{i,c,y(t)}$ is the share of product $i$ in total revenue of subcategory $c$ in establishment $j$ during the calendar year of month $t$.\footnote{As pointed out by\cite{renkin2020}, price indexes are often constructed using lagged quantity weights. Since product turnover is high in cannabis retail, lagged weights would limit the number of products used in constructing the price indexes. Thus, contemporaneous weights are used.}

In the second step, I aggregate across subcategories to get the price index for establishment $j$ in month $t$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:a.2}
    I_{j,t} = \prod_c I_{c,j,t}^{\omega_{c,j,y(t)}}.
\end{equation}
Similar to the last step, the weight $\omega_{c,j,y(t)}$ is the share of subcategory $c$ in total revenue in establishment $j$ during the calendar year of month $t$.

Establishment-level price indexes for wholesalers are constructed in a very similar manner as with retailers, but for two exceptions. First, at the wholesale level a product is identified by a unique combination of four  elements (not five as with retailers): wholesaler-category-unit weight-product name. While a retailer may sell similar products produced by different wholesalers, a wholesaler creates the product and sells it to many retailers, which makes it unnecessary to identify a product at the five-element level. Note that this still allows for wholesale price discrimination, since the wholesale price of a single product may differ among retailers. Second, the wholesale price data exhibits much larger variation in prices compared to the retail data. As a result, the product-level index $\frac{P_{i,j,t}}{P_{i,j,t-1}}$ in eq. \ref{eq:a.1} leads to a few inconceivable outliers such as a 562-factor increase in prices from one month to the next. To prevent outliers from driving results and to reduce standard errors in my estimation, I trim the top and bottom 0.1\% of the product indexes before calculating the subcategory index in equation \ref{eq:a.1}. As table \ref{tab:a.1} illustrates, trimming does not meaningfully change the location or shape of the distribution but lowers the standard deviation considerably.

\begin{table}[!htbp]

\label{tab:a.1}
\include{tables/product_level_price_index_descriptive_statistics}
\end{table}

% -----------------------------------------
\subsection{Establishment-level markup index}
% -----------------------------------------

This section describes the construction of the establishment-level markup indexes used in section \ref{section:6}. For each individual product, the markup over marginal input cost (MIC) is defined as:
\begin{equation}
    \mu_{i,r,t} = \frac{P_{i,r,t}}{MC_{i,r,t}}
\end{equation}
where $P_{i,r,t}$ is the price of product $i$ sold by retail establishment $r$ in month $t$, and $MC_{i,r,t}$ is the wholesale price that retailer $r$ pays for that very same product in period $t$. Note that this formulation implicitly assumes that the markup of interest is contemporaneous (period $t$ retail price and period $t$ wholesale price) rather than lagged (period $t$ retail price and period $t-1$ wholesale price).

To construct establishment-level markup indexes, I employ a two step procedure similar to that used for the price indexes throughout the paper. In the first step, I use $\mu_{i,r,t}$ to construct a geometric mean of month-over-month changes in markups for product subcategory $c$ at establishment $r$:
\begin{equation}
    I^{\mu}_{c,r,t} = \prod_i \left( \frac{\mu_{i,r,t}}{\mu_{i,r,t-1}}\right)^{\omega_{i,c,y(t)}}
\end{equation}
where each subcategory is a unique category-unit weight combination. The weight $\omega_{i,c,y(t)}$ is the share of product $i$ in total revenue of subcategory $c$ in establishment $r$ during the calendar year of month $t$.

In the second step, I aggregate across subcategories to get the markup index for establishment $r$ in month $t$:
\begin{equation}
    I^{\mu}_{r,t} = \prod_c I_{c,r,t}^{\omega_{c,r,y(t)}}.
\end{equation}
Here, the weight $\omega_{c,r,y(t)}$ is the share of subcategory $c$ in total revenue in establishment $r$ during the calendar year of month $t$. The dependent variable is then obtained by taking the natural logarithm of markup index: $\Delta \mu_{r,t} = \ln I^{\mu}_{r,t}$.

\subsection*{NAICS classification for cannabis establishments}
%% =========================================================

Defining the minimum wage bite variable at the industry-by-county level requires careful consideration of which industry codes to use since establishments in the cannabis industry may fall under more than one North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) subsector. The underlying principle of the NAICS system---that establishments with similar production processes be grouped together---greatly facilitates this, since the NAICS subsectors align well with the vertically disintegrated structure of the cannabis industry. For example, NAICS subsector 453 captures all cannabis retailers, since NAICS 453998, a component of that subsector, includes "All Other Miscellaneous Store Retailers (except Tobacco Stores), including Marijuana Stores, Medicinal and Recreational" \citep{naics2007}. At the wholesale level, NAICS 111 captures all cannabis growers, since NAICS 111998 includes "All Other Miscellaneous Crop Farming, including Marijuana Grown in an Open Field" and NAICS 111419 includes "Other Food Crops Grown Under Cover, including Marijuana Grown Under Cover" \citep{naics2007}. Slightly complicating things is the fact that in addition to growing cannabis, most producers are also processors (i.e. producer-processors). Processing falls under NAICS 424 which includes as a subcomponent "Other Farm Product Raw Material Merchant Wholesalers, including Marijuana Merchant wholesalers" (NAICS 424590).\footnote{A third subsector, NAICS 115, may also apply to producer-processors. This subsector captures support activities for agriculture involving soil preparation, planting, and cultivating. However, to be in this subsector an establishment must primarily perform these activities independent of the agriculture producing establishment, e.g. on a contractual basis. It is very unlikely that an establishment with a coveted producer-processor license would solely operate on a contractual basis without engaging in any production of its own. Therefore, I do not consider NAICS 115 in my main analysis.} Importantly, though, NAICS classifies an establishment based on its primary activity, meaning that a wholesaler only belongs to NAICS 424 if the receipts/sales and revenue from processing activities exceed those of its own crop production \citep{naics2007}. I view it as more likely that a producer-processor belongs to NAICS 111 for two reasons. First, while it is not possible to directly compare the revenue share of crop production versus processing activities at the firm level, at the industry level unprocessed "Usable Marijuana" accounts for over 61\% of producer-processors' revenue in my sample period. Therefore, I classify all establishments with a joint producer-processor license as NAICS 111, which effectively assumes that crop production activities exceed processing activities for these establishments. Establishments with only a processor license (i.e. those allowed to process---but not grow---cannabis) would then be assigned NAICS 424, which is their proper classification. However, the very small number of processor licenses makes it difficult to identify treatment effects, so I drop processor-only licenses from my sample altogether. 

Table \ref{tab:b.1} provides an overview of the representativeness of cannabis employment in the respective 3-digit NAICS subsectors. The employment share for cannabis retailers is larger than that for wholesalers, but the shares remain relatively constant over time for both wholesalers and retailers. The fact that NAICS 111 is less representative does not imply that measurement error for the wholesale regressions is greater than that for the retail regressions, since it could be the case that the industries contained in NAICS 453 are more homogeneous than those in NAICS 111. A better indication of measurement error is the relation between cannabis wages and wages at the subsector level. Table \ref{tab:g.1} in appendix \ref{appendix:g} shows that mean annual wages for cannabis establishments are remarkably similar to their corresponding NAICS subsectors and very close to the wage floor imposed by the minimum wage.

\begin{table}[!htbp] 
\centering
\caption{Employment in cannabis relative to 3-digit NAICS subsector}
\label{tab:b.1}
\include{tables/employment_shares}
\end{table}

\subsection*{Measurement error in NAICS 111}

The nature of agricultural labor in the United States means that one must consider whether the bite variable for NAICS 111 is not subject to non-random measurement error. Non-random measurement error could arise for several reasons, and each is discussed in the following subsections.

\subsubsection*{Undocumented workers in NAICS 111}
First, if a significant amount of labor in NAICS 111 is performed by low-wage, undocumented migrants who are not eligible for unemployment insurance (and hence do not factor into the bite variable), then the bite variable may overestimate minimum wage exposure. Counties with more undocumented workers will have a smaller true (unobserved) bite, which amounts to classical errors-in-variables. Several facts speak against this being problematic. First, the prevalence of undocumented agricultural labor likely correlates over time within a county. As such, county fixed effects should sweep away cross-county differences in this measurement error. Second, to the extent that measurement error remains after demeaning, the bias leads to conservative treatment effects by attenuating the OLS estimates.

\subsubsection*{Seasonal labor in NAICS 111}
A second issue is that Washington's crop production is highly seasonal and the major crop types are primarily harvested in Q3. Since the minimum wage hikes in my sample occur on January 1st of each year, the bite variable---calculated two periods prior to the hike---is based on Q3 wages. As a result, the bite variable may overestimate true minimum wage exposure due to seasonal fluctuations in agricultural labor. If counties with higher observed bite employ more low-wage seasonal labor (e.g. low wage rural counties), then the measurement error is non-random and OLS is biased. Unlike in the previous subsection, this is not classical errors-in-variables. Nevertheless, an easy way to overcome this would be to use Q4 bite instead, since Q4 does not coincide with any major harvest activity and hence should be free of seasonal wage fluctuations. As shown in appendix \ref{appendix:d}, estimates are robust to using Q4 bite, suggesting the main results are not affected by measurement error from seasonal wage fluctuations.

\subsubsection*{Measurement error and treatment effect timing}
Finally, setting aside the reasoning laid out in the previous two subsections, the fact remains that any bias from non-random time-varying measurement error would need to coincide with the timing of the minimum wage hike. In other words, for the main results to be driven by measurement error, the bias would have to cause a sharp inflationary shock at precisely the same time as the hike---not before and not after. I view such a scenario as unlikely.

\section{Bite-specific trend}
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{appendix:c}

%% =========================================================
\subsection{Direct pass-through to wholesale prices}
%% =========================================================

As shown in figure \ref{fig:5.1} in section \ref{section:4}, trend-adjusting the dependent variable for the wholesalers does not change the contemporaneous treatment effect, but it does affect pass-through estimates over a longer time horizon. Adjusting for the trend results in a permanently higher price level, whereas not adjusting results in the positive effect in period $t$ being undone in subsequent periods. Given this discrepancy, it is important to ensure that the trend is robust to a variety of specifications and assumptions. This section provides a detailed exposition of the bite-specific trend and illustrates the empirical validity of the adjustment using two different methods. The first method uses a single, pooled trend for to the entire sample period. This is the method that I use in the main part of the paper (see section \ref{section:4}). The second method estimates a separate trend for each of the three events, and only adjusts the dependent variable for events with a significant trend. As I show below, how one adjusts for the trend matters little, as both methods lead to similar results.

\subsubsection*{Pooled trend}
Since my research design pools three minimum wage events, the most obvious way to adjust for the bite-specific trend is to fit a single trend onto the pooled events. This is the strategy I adopt in the main part of the paper. A bite-specific trend in the price \emph{level} occurs if $\bar{\hat{ \beta}}_{pre}$, the average of the distributed lag coefficients in the pre-treatment period (i.e. the average \emph{change} in the price level effect), is statistically significantly different from zero. As table \ref{tab:c1} illustrates, this is indeed the case: regardless of whether one includes 5 or 4 leads in the pre-treatment period, bite has a systematic, negative effect on inflation over the pre-treatment period. Though the trend extends through 5 leads (i.e. through $t-1$, see figure \ref{fig:5.1}), I use the estimate from 4 leads (i.e. through $t-2$) when detrending since the base period is set to $t-2$ in my main analysis. Trend-adjustment proceeds as follows: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Compute the average of the distributed lag coefficients for the pre-baseline periods:
    \begin{equation*}
        \bar{\hat{ \beta}}_{pre} = 1/4 \sum_{l=2}^{5} \hat{\beta}_{-l}
    \end{equation*}
     where $\bar{\hat{ \beta}}_{pre}$ is the average \emph{change} in the pre-treatment price level effect.
    \item Use $\bar{\hat{ \beta}}_{pre}$ to obtain predicted values for the bite-specific trend over the entire event window: 
    \begin{equation*}
        \hat \pi_{j,t} = \bar{\hat{\beta}}_{pre} \times \Delta MW_{j,t-l} \times Bite_{k(j),t-l}
    \end{equation*}
    \item Estimate equation \ref{eq:2} using adjusted inflation $\tilde \pi_{j,t}$ as the dependent variable:
    \begin{equation*}
        \tilde{\pi}_{j,t} = \pi_{j,t} - \hat \pi_{j,t}
    \end{equation*}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{table}[!htbp] 
\centering
\caption{Bite-specific trend estimates for wholesalers}
\label{tab:c1}
\include{tables_no_10_mo_restriction/whole_bite_specific_trend}%/wholesale_bite_specific_trend_table}
\end{table}

\subsubsection*{Separate trends}
A concern with the trend adjustment presented above is that, though the pooled events exhibit a significant pre-trend, the estimated trend may fit some events better than others. If one or more events exhibit a different trend---or no trend at all---then fitting a single trend onto all events may be misleading. Therefore, in this subsection, I examine each event separately and show that events 1 and 3 exhibit no significant pre-trend while event 2 contains a strong pre-trend that largely mirrors the single trend found in figure \ref{fig:5.1}. 

Event-specific trends are estimated as follows: First, I estimate equation \ref{eq:2} separately for each event using the original (unadjusted) dependent variable. Next, for each event, I compute the average of the distributed lag coefficients for the pre-baseline periods, $\bar{\hat{ \beta}}_{pre,e} = 1/4 \sum_{l=2}^{5} \hat{\beta}_{-l}$, where $\bar{\hat{ \beta}}_{pre}$ is the average pre-treatment \emph{change} in the price level effect for event $e$ (since equation \ref{eq:2} is in first differences). As table \ref{tab:c1} illustrates, $\bar{\hat{ \beta}}_{pre,e}$ is only statistically significantly different from zero for event 2, meaning there is no bite-specific trend for events 1 and 3. I therefore adjust $ \pi_{j,t}$ for event 2 only and leave the other events unadjusted. Specifically, I use $\bar{\hat{ \beta}}_{pre,e=2}$ to obtain predicted values for the bite-specific trend for the entire event window: $\hat \pi_{j,t(e=2)} = \bar{\hat{\beta}}_{pre(e=2)} \times \Delta MW_{j,t-l(e=2)} \times Bite_{k(j),t-l(e=2)}$. Finally, I estimate equation \ref{eq:2} using adjusted inflation $\tilde \pi_{j,t}$ as the dependent variable 
\begin{equation}\label{}
    \tilde \pi_{j,t(e)} =
    \begin{cases}
        \pi_{j,t(e)} & \text{if}\ e = 1,3\\ 
        \pi_{j,t(e)} - \hat \pi_{j,t(e)} & \text{if}\ e = 2
    \end{cases}
\end{equation} 

Given these findings, I adjust the dependent variable for event 2 while leaving events 1 and 3 unadjusted. As figure \ref{fig:c.1} illustrates, this approach leads to very similar results as the pooled adjustment. As a robustness check, I adjust all 3 events for an event-specific trend irregardless of statistical significance of the trend. Figure \ref{fig:c.1} shows that estimated effects are very similar.

\subsection{Indirect pass-through to retail prices}

To quantify the pre-treatment trend for indirect pass-through, I again take the average of the distributed lag coefficients for the pre-baseline period, $\bar{\hat{\psi}}_{pre} = 1/4 \sum_{l=2}^{5} \hat{\psi}_{-l}$, where $\bar{\hat{\psi}}_{pre}$ is the average \emph{change} in the pre-treatment effect. I find that $\bar{\hat{ \psi}}_{pre} = -.00102$ ($90\%$ confidence interval: $-0.00329$ to $0.00126$) which overlaps with the pre-trend for pass-through to wholesale prices, $\bar{\hat{ \beta}}_{pre} = -0.00197$ ($90\%$ confidence interval: $-0.00367$ to $-0.00026$).\footnote{$\bar{\hat{\psi}}_{pre}$ is based on equation \ref{eq:5} with time fixed effects and county-level controls. $\bar{\hat{ \beta}}_{pre}$ is based on equation \ref{eq:2} with time fixed effects and county fixed effects. The pre-trend reported here is from pooled events. For both equations, the pre-trend is stable across a variety of specifications.}

\subsection{Minimum wage compliance and exempt workers}
% %% =========================================================

When investigating minimum wage effects, it is important to consider the possibility that not all firms or workers comply with minimum wage hikes. If that were the case, then the share of FTE earning below the minimum wage would overestimate the impact of the minimum wage on firm costs, resulting in potentially non-random measurement error in the treatment variable. Luckily, bite lends itself well to measuring minimum wage compliance since bite can be measured one quarter after the minimum wage hikes. Figure \ref{fig:d.1} shows the average bite one quarter after the minimum wage hikes between 2018-2021. While bite is low for most counties in the crop production subsector (panel a), several counties have relatively high bite for miscellaneous store retailers (panel b). The ESD examined employee-level payroll data at the establishments responsible for these high bite counties and confirmed that the relatively high post-hike bite is a result of minimum wage exemptions rather than non-compliance or data reporting issues.\footnote{The ESD has safeguards in place to flag sub-minimum wages at the employee and firm level. Implausibly low wages are either excluded from the bite variable or the wages are substituted with a previous valid quarter for that employer, adjusting for payroll and inflation.} Under certain circumstances, employers can apply for permission to pay eligible employees less than the state minimum wage.\footnote{Eligibility applies to workers with a disability, employees in job training, student workers in vocational training, student workers employed at an academic institution, and apprentices. Permission must be granted by both the Washington state Department of Labor and Industries and the U.S. Department of Labor.} With the exception of workers with disabilities, however, exempt employees must still be paid 75\% of the state minimum wage (85\% for on-the-job training).\footnote{See \cite{wamw}.} Thus, for exempt employees at the 75\% threshold, the minimum wage hike corresponds to a wage increase. Moreover, wages slightly above the minimum wage have been shown to be responsive to minimum wage hikes, meaning that the minimum wage hike likely increases wages for exempt employees above the 75\% threshold too.\footnote{For example, \cite{gopalan2021} find that wage increases extend up to \$2.50 above the minimum wage.} 

To summarize, high post-hike bite values in some counties reflect sub-minimum wages paid to exempt employees. Since these employees likely experience a wage increase due to the minimum wage hike, the bite variable in the main analysis (computed two quarters prior to the hike) likely captures true minimum wage exposure. Nevertheless, I test whether removing exempt employees changes the results from the main part of the paper. To do this, I create a new bite variable that is equal to the difference between bite two quarters prior and one quarter after the hike:
\begin{equation}
    \Delta Bite_{k(j)} = Bite_{k(j),Q3,y}-Bite_{k(j),Q1,y+1}
\end{equation}
This effectively nets out non-compliance and exempt employees at the county level. Tables \ref{tab:d.1} and \ref{tab:d.2} show that results are robust to this alternative bite variable.

\subsection{Reverse causality}\label{appendix:d.2}
% %% =========================================================

While the overwhelming majority of cities and counties in the sample are subject to exogenous statewide minimum wage hikes, there is one exception: the city of Seattle, located in King county, has a citywide minimum wage that may, under certain circumstances, result in an endogenous bite variable. This section lists the assumptions under which Seattle's minimum wage may be endogenous and reports results that take this potential endogeneity into account.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\caption{Seattle citywide minimum wage schedule, 2018-2022}

\begin{minipage}[h]{\textwidth}
\small \emph{Notes:} The figure shows the schedule for the citywide minimum wage in Seattle. The solid blue line is the minimum wage applicable to employees who receive health benefits or tips, while the dashed line is the minimum wage for employees without benefits or tips. Data source: Washington ESD.
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

Employment at Seattle establishments is subject to one of two minimum wages, depending on employer contributions to employee medical benefits and whether an employee earns tips.\footnote{Technically, this only applies to small employers (500 or fewer employees), as large firms (over 500 employees) are subject to a separate minimum wage. However, no cannabis firm has more than 500 employees and the average firm size in King county is 10 employees for NAICS 111 and 11.5 employees for NAICS 453 during the sample period. I therefore omit the large firm minimum wage from my analysis.} Employees who receive health benefits or tips are subject to a lower minimum wage than those who do not (figure \ref{fig:d.2}). For the former, the minimum wage schedule was pre-determined over the sample period, making the hikes contemporaneously exogenous.\footnote{The schedule was determined in 2015.} For the latter group of employees, the hikes for events 1 and 2 (January 1, 2019 and January 1, 2020) were predetermined, while the hike for event 3 was linked to a local CPI. Thus, event 3 may be endogenous for some Seattle establishments, and potentially also for the county Seattle is located in (King county).

Since the treatment variable $\Delta MW_{j,t-l} \times Bite_{k(j),t-l}$ is the product of two parts, it is important to consider how Seattle's minimum wage affects each part in turn. The following assumptions delineate circumstances under which one or both of these parts could be endogenous.

\subsubsection*{Assumption 1 (Exogeneity)}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item [\textbf{1.A:}] \label{as:1B} All Seattle firms in NAICS 111 (NAICS 453) pay benefits or tips
    \end{enumerate}
Under assumption \textbf{1.A}, $\Delta MW_{j,t-l} \times Bite_{k(j),t-l}$ is contemporaneously exogenous because minimum wage hikes are predetermined for entire the sample period. The results in sections \ref{section:4} and \ref{section:5} are based on assumption 1.

\subsubsection*{Assumption 2 (No spillovers to King county)}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item [\textbf{2.A:}] No Seattle firms in NAICS 111 (NAICS 453) pay benefits or tips
        \item [\textbf{2.B:}] There are no spillovers from the Seattle minimum wage hike to wages at establishments located outside of Seattle but in King County (applies to event 3 only).
    \end{enumerate}
Under assumption \textbf{2.A}, $\Delta MW_{j,t-l}$ is predetermined (and hence exogenous) for Seattle establishments in events 1 and 2, but it is endogenous for event 3. Thus, Seattle establishments must be dropped from the sample for event 3. Under assumption \textbf{2.B}, Seattle's endogenous hike at event 3 does not affect $Bite_{k(j),t-l(e=3)}$, meaning non-Seattle establishments located in King County can be kept in the sample for that event. $Bite_{k(j),t-l(e=3)}$ will be mismeasured for King County at event 3 which may attenuate estimates.

\subsubsection*{Assumption 3 (Spillovers to King county)}
    \begin{itemize}
        % \item [\textbf{3.A:}] \label{assump-3A} All Seattle firms in NAICS 111 (NAICS 453) have $<$ 500 employees
        \item [\textbf{3.A:}]\label{as:3A} No Seattle firms in NAICS 111 (NAICS 453) pay benefits or tips
        \item [\textbf{3.B:}]\label{as:3B} There are spillovers from the Seattle minimum wage hike to wages at non-Seattle establishments in King County (applies to event 3 only).
    \end{itemize}
Assumption \textbf{3.A} carries over from \textbf{2.A}, meaning $\Delta MW_{j,t-l}$ is exogenous for Seattle establishments in events 1 and 2 but it is endogenous for event 3. Now however, assumption \textbf{3.B} implies that $Bite_{k(j),t-l(e=3)}$ is also endogenous for event 3, since Seattle's endogenous minimum wage hike spills over to surrounding King county establishments, possibly lowering the King county bite. This means that all King county establishments must be dropped from the sample for event 3.

Table \ref{tab:d.1} reports results from estimating equation \ref{eq:2} under assumptions 2 and 3 for wholesalers. As columns 3 and 4 illustrate, wholesale price effects are very similar to those obtained in the main paper. Table \ref{tab:d.2}  (columns 3 and 4) shows that the same holds for retail price effects. Taken together, these results suggest that reverse causality from Seattle's minimum wage does not drive my main results.

% %% =========================================================
\subsection{Bite as treatment intensity}
% %% =========================================================

The main results do not rely on interacting bite with the size of the minimum wage hike. To verify this, I estimate a variation of equation \ref{eq:2}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:d.4}
   \pi_{j,t} = \sum_{l =-6}^{5} \beta_l Bite_{k(j),t-l} + X_{k(j),t} + \theta_k + \gamma_t + \epsilon_{j,t}.
\end{equation}
Here, the treatment intensity is the minimum wage bite and it is not multiplied with $\Delta MW_{j, t-l}$. Figure \ref{fig:d.4} shows that retail and wholesale price effects follow a very similar time path to those in the main section. Since the treatment intensity variable is defined differently, the coefficients are not directly comparable to those in the main section. However, the relative magnitude of direct pass-through to wholesale and retail prices is the same as in the main part of the paper. Two months after a minimum wage hike, direct pass-through to wholesale prices is approximately twice the size of direct pass-through to retail prices.

\subsection{Bite at the detailed industry level (5-digit NAICS)}\label{appendix:d.3}
% %% =========================================================

In this section, I use an alternate bite variable based on more detailed NAICS codes and wage data from the QCEW. In particular, I define bite as the difference between the FTE weekly minimum wage salary and the actual average weekly wage, where the latter is reported by the QCEW on a quarterly basis. This bite variable is similar to that used in other papers on minimum wage effects (see e.g. \cite{renkin2020,leung2021}). I estimate equation \ref{eq:2} with this alternative bite variable in place of the original bite variable in the treatment intensity interaction term $\sum_{l =-6}^{5} \beta_l \Delta MW_{j,t-l} \times Bite_{k(j),t-l}$. However, despite the more granular level of industrial classification, the alternative bite variable carries several disadvantages. First, due to the wage floor imposed by the minimum wage, outliers will pull the mean wage upwards. Thus, a bite variable proportional to the mean wage will likely underestimate true exposure to the minimum wage.\footnote{An alternative would be to use the median wage. Unfortunately, the QCEW does not publish median wages at the detailed industry-by-county level.} Second, while cannabis producer-processors belong to a single three-digit NAICS code (111), they fall under two different four- and five-digit NAICS codes depending on whether they are indoor or outdoor growers (indoor growers belong to NAICS 11141 while outdoor growers belong to NAICS 11199). Producer-processor licenses are based on a three-tier system governing the square footage of plant canopy a producer is permitted to operate. Tiers 1 and 2 permit 2,000 and 10,000 square feet of plant canopy, respectively, and thus largely comprise indoor grow operations \citep{lcbtier1}. Tier 3 producers can operate up to 30,000 square feet of plant canopy, meaning tier 3 comprises more balanced mix of indoor and outdoor grow operations compared to tiers 1 and 2.\footnote{For example, only 10\% of Tier 1 producers grow outdoors \citep{lcbtier1}.} Thus, it is not possible to determine which five-digit NAICS code applies to the majority of tier 3 producers, meaning substantial measurement error will result for tier 3 producers in either case. Therefore, I drop tier 3 producers from the sample and I restrict the analysis to tiers 1 and 2 (i.e. indoor growers) and use NAICS 11141 for the bite variable.\footnote{NAICS 11141 corresponds to "Food Crops Grown Under Cover" and includes as a subcategory "Other Food Crops Grown Under Cover, including Marijuana Grown Under Cover" \citep{naics2007}.}

A final disadvantage to the more detailed industry classification is that the QCEW data does not distinguish between full-time and part-time workers, meaning the wage data are not based on FTE. This contrasts to the bite variable in the main specification, which is based on FTE.

Figures \ref{fig:d.3a} and \ref{fig:d.3b} show sharp inflationary treatment effects at the period of the minimum wage hike for both wholesale and retail cannabis prices, and the effect is statistically significant at the 10\% and 5\% level, respectively.

\subsection{Direct retail pass-through with joint bite}
% ====================================================

When estimating indirect retail pass-through, one concern is whether the estimates for $\beta_l$---the direct pass-through rate---are affected by the inclusion of joint bite as an additional variable. If estimates for direct pass-through were to change, this would cast doubt on the main identification strategy and, by extension, the results from section \ref{section:4}. Figure \ref{fig:6.1} compares cumulative direct pass-through from equation \ref{eq:5} with and without joint wholesale bite included. Reassuringly, the figure shows that direct pass-through estimates are unaffected by the inclusion of joint wholesale bite. The pre-treatment period is identical and treatment effects appear in $t-2$ for both specifications. Including joint wholesale bite slightly attenuates the estimates, but the difference is not statistically significant (as evidenced by the overlapping confidence intervals).

\subsection{Legislation vs. implementation for event 3}\label{appendix:h.3}
% ====================================================
For event 3, the new minimum wage hike was announced in September 2020, three months before implementation on January 1st, 2021. In this section, I test whether price effects emerge at the time that the hike size was made public ($t-4$) versus when it was implemented ($t$). To do this, I estimate equation \ref{eq:2} for event 3 only. Figure \ref{fig:h.4} shows no evidence of price level effects in $t-4$ for wholesale and retail prices. Instead, treatment effects appear in period $t-1$ for wholesale prices and $t-2$ for retail prices, which is identical to the results in the main part of the paper. Note that, in contrast to the main results, retail price effects for event 3 are undone in later periods and return to zero by $t+4$.

\subsection{Region-time FE}\label{appendix:i}
% -----------------------------------------------

The Cascade mountain range and a semiarid shrub-steppe create three distinct socioeconomic, political, and topographic regions in Washington state (West, Central, and East), depicted in figure \ref{fig:i.1}. To account for time-variant unobserved heterogeneity across these regions I estimate equation \ref{eq:2} with region-time FE (i.e. region $\times$ time interaction terms). To ensure the robustness of the region $\times$ time specification, I define regions in two different ways. The first is the specification presented in section \ref{section:5}, which defines three regions (West, Central, East) based on well-established topographic and economic boundaries in Washington state. For the second version, I collapse the latter two regions (Central and East) into a single region (East), creating two distinct regions (West and East). This corresponds to the boundary specified by the Washington state legislature in repeated attempts to create two separate states \cite{hallenberg2017}. Note that this boundary is clearly visible in the average bite depicted in figure \ref{fig:2a} in the main part of the paper.

Panel (b) depicts cumulative price level effects ($E_L$) relative to the baseline period in $t-2$. Cumulative effects $E_L$ are obtained by summing the distributed lag coefficients to lead or lag $L$ as detailed in the main text. Panel (b) shows 90\% confidence intervals of the sums based on SE clustered at the county level. Data source: Top Shelf Data and Washington ESD, July 2018 to August 2021.

Next, I show that region-time FE remove the pre-trend for the wholesale price pass-through estimates under a variety of other specifications. %Note that including county FE attenuates estimates, indicating removal of significant amount of identifying information \cite{meer2016,neumark2014}.

\small \emph{Notes:} The figures show direct pass-through to wholesale prices estimated from equation \ref{eq:2} with region-time FE. The dependent variable is the establishment-level inflation rate. The three regions are West, Central, and East, as described above. The baseline specification is is with county controls; the winsorized specification caps the top/bottom 0.5\% of the monthly distribution of inflation rates. Outliers indicates no trimming or winsorizing. Panel (a) shows the estimated distributed lag coefficients, $\hat \beta_l$, with 90\% confidence intervals based on SE clustered at the county level.

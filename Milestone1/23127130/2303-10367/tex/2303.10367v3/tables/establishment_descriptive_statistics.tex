\small \emph{Notes:} This table displays summary statistics for the estimation sample. The sample period is August 2018 through July 2021. Panel (a) reports totals across all establishments and months in the sample. Panel (b) reports monthly averages at the establishment level. Sales from processor-only establishments are excluded. Sales between producer-processor establishments are included. Retail revenue is based on tax-inclusive prices. Panel (c) shows market shares for the product categories defined by the LCB. "Other" includes any category with less than 1 percent market share. These are: topical, packaged marijuana mix, capsules, tinctures, transdermal patches, sample jar, and suppository. Sales from processor-only establishments are excluded. Sales between producer-processor establishments are included. Data source: Top Shelf Data.Data source: Top Shelf Data.\\
$^{+}$ For producers, the LCB reports the unit weight for some product types (e.g. flower lots) in 1g units regardless of how the product is actually bundled. For such items, the number of units is the weight of the product in grams. As a result, the number of distinct products visible in the wholesale data is artificially low (since different unit weights are treated as a single product), and the number of units sold is artificially high.

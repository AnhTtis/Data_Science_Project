    "abstract": "Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are one of the most promising NISQ-era algorithms since they are applicable to a wide variety of fields. However, the underlying optimization processes within these algorithms usually deal with local minima and barren plateau problems, preventing them from scaling efficiently. Our goal in this paper is to study alternative optimization methods that avoid or reduce the effect of these problems. To this end, we propose to apply the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm to VQAs. Our hypothesis is that DE is resilient to vanishing gradients and local minima for two main reasons: (i) it does not depend on gradients, and (ii) its mutation and recombination schemes allow DE to continue evolving even in these cases. To demonstrate the performance of our approach, we use a robust local minima problem to compare state-of-the-art local optimizers (SLSQP, COBYLA, L-BFGS-B and SPSA) against DE using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver algorithm. Our results show that DE always outperforms local optimizers. In particular, in our experiments with 14 qubits, DE achieves the ground state with 100\\% success rate, while local optimizers only achieve around 40\\%. We also show that DE can be combined with local optimizers to avoid all local minima as well as to provide a high convergence to the global minimum.",

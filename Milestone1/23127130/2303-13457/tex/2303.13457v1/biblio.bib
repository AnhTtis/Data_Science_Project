abstract={Recent progress in astrophysical hydromagnetic turbulence is being reviewed. The physical ideas behind the now widely accepted Goldreich--Sridhar model and its extension to compressible magnetohydrodynamic turbulence are introduced. Implications for cosmic ray diffusion and acceleration is being discussed. Dynamo-generated magnetic fields with and without helicity are contrasted against each other. Certain turbulent transport processes are being modified and often suppressed by anisotropy and inhomogeneities of the turbulence, while others are being produced by such properties, which can lead to new large-scale instabilities of the turbulent medium. Applications of various such processes to astrophysical systems are being considered.},

abstract={The paper presents an extended review of our knowledge and understanding of turbulence in a superfluid (4He and 3He-B), a system in which turbulent flow can be greatly influenced by quantum effects such as those leading to the restriction of rotational superfluid flow to quantized vortex lines. Introductions are included to relevant aspects of classical turbulence and superfluid dynamics, and there are discussions of experimental methods and of the use of computer simulations. A brief description is given of counterflow turbulence, which was discovered 50 years ago and for many aspects of which there is a well-established theory. Counterflow turbulence has no classical analogue. Most of the paper is devoted to more recent experimental and theoretical work, which has focussed on types of quantum turbulence that do have classical analogues, especially those relating to the simplest case of turbulence that is spatially homogeneous. It is argued that turbulence in the quantum case is probably very similar to that in the classical case on length scales large compared with a characteristic quantum length scale equal to the spacing between the vortex lines. On smaller length scales the two types of turbulence must be very different, and the probable characteristics of quantum turbulence on these small length scales are explored. Emphasis is placed on the need for further experiments, especially at very low temperatures, where crucial ideas can be checked in a particularly straightforward way, and where novel quantum effects are likely to play an important role.},

    abstract = { We examine developments in the study of quantum turbulence with a special focus on clearly defining many of the terms used in the field. We critically review the diverse theoretical, computational, and experimental approaches from the point of view of experimental observers. Similarities and differences between the general properties of classical and quantum turbulence are elucidated. The dynamics and interactions of quantized vortices and their role in quantum turbulence are discussed with particular emphasis on reconnection and vortex ring collapse. A stark distinction between the velocity statistics of quantum and classical turbulence is exhibited and used to highlight a potential analogy between quantum turbulence and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in astrophysical plasmas. Although much of this review pertains to superfluid 4He (He II), the underlying science is broadly applicable to other quantum fluids such as 3He-B, type-II superconductors, Bose-Einstein condensates, Weinberg-Salam fields, and grand-unified-theory (GUT) Higgs fields. }

In addition, code verification studies and benchmarks are presented.}

More specifically, does there exist a class of V-Langevin equations with long-range (algebraic) velocity temporal correlation, that leads to a time-fractional superdiffusive process? The answer is always affirmative in one dimension. It is always negative in two dimensions: any algebraically decaying temporal velocity correlation (with a Gaussian spatial correlation) produces a normal diffusive process. General conditions relating the diffusive nature of the process to the temporal exponent of the Lagrangian velocity correlation (in Corrsin approximation) are derived. It is shown that a bifurcation occurs as the latter parameter is varied. Above that bifurcation value the process is always diffusive.}

From an Eulerian perspective, our method is designed to exhibit improved convergence rates. From a Lagrangian perspective, our method offers a pertinent description of particle trajectories in turbulent velocity fields: the exact Lagrangian invariant laws are well reproduced. From a computational perspective, the computing time is reduced by a factor of two in comparison with Fourier-like or Blob-like methods and an order of magnitude in comparison with FFT algorithms.},

This chapter reviews the measurement of joint probability in turbulent dispersion of heat from two line sources. It discusses that resistance thermometer correlation measurements of the thermal pulse signals due to the unsteady hot sheets behind parallel line sources, are suggested for estimation of the joint probability density of fluid particle displacements. In addition to the well-known nearly normal shape of the individual probability densities, it is found that these displacements are also close to being jointly normal. Still, there is insufficient data for reliable calculation of the streamwise variation of mean square displacement difference. The chapter also discusses some of the problems connected with particle dispersion. Under appropriate restrictions the differential equation for the motion of a small, solid sphere in turbulent fluid can be linearized and approximated in the quasi-steady form often assumed.}

	abstract = {The results of a study of the statistical space/time properties of the turbulence observed in the edge region of the Pretext tokamak are reported. A local estimate of the wavenumber frequency spectra S(κ,ω) for poloidal (ky)an d toroidal (kz) wavenumbers is determined for the range 0.5 cm−1 < k < 7.5 cm−1, for both potential and density fluctuations obtained from spatially fixed Langmuir probe pairs. The S(ky, ω) spectra aredominated by low frequencies ( < 200 kHz) and small wavenumbers (< 3 cm−1) and appear broadened about an approximately linear statistical dispersion relation, k̄(ω). The broadening is characterized by a spectral width σk (ω) (root-mean-square deviation about k̄(ω)) which is of the order of k̄(ω). The turbulence appears to propagate poloidally with an apparent mean phase velocity of (1–2) × 105 cm·s−1 in the ion diamagnetic drift direction. Measurements of the fluctuation-induced particle transport reveal the particle flux to be outward and resulting primarily from the low-frequency, long-wavelength components of the turbulence. A particle diffusion coefficient Dx, estimated from the measured particle flux and density profiles, is of the order of the coefficient estimated for Bohm diffusion, but appears to increase with density.}

journal = {Nuclear Fusion},
abstract = {A detailed analysis of a special type of turbulent pinch mechanism for tungsten (W) ions is presented. It is based on the numerical simulation of ion trajectories in a complex test-particle model that contains realistic representations of the turbulence and of the confining magnetic field, plasma rotation, ion collisions, the polarization drift and the parallel stochastic acceleration. The origin of the pinch is a special type of order generated by an average poloidal velocity V p superposed on the E × B stochastic drift. It consists of a pair of radial symmetric drifts, the hidden drifts (HDs), that exactly compensate. The polarization drift and the parallel acceleration drive radial pinch velocities V  x  by destroying the perfect anti-symmetry of the HDs. These phenomena that were found in simplified models are theoretically validated here in a realistic model of W ion transport. The main conclusion of the paper is that this turbulent mechanism can be experimentally relevant for a large domain of parameters, which cover both existing plasmas and ITER conditions, and it can be responsible for an important amount of the W ion accumulation.}

title = {Effects of the parallel acceleration on heavy impurity transport in turbulent tokamak plasmas},
journal = {Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion},
abstract = {A process specific to the dynamics of the heavy impurities in turbulent tokamak plasmas is found and analyzed. We show that the parallel stochastic acceleration is strongly coupled to the perpendicular transport and generates a radial pinch velocity. The interaction is produced with the hidden drifts, a quasi-coherent component of the motion that consists of a pair of average radial velocities in opposite directions. The parallel acceleration breaks this symmetry and yields a radial average velocity that can be in the inward or outward direction. The pinch is generated in three-dimensional turbulence, in the presence of a poloidal average velocity. It is significant only for heavy, high Z ions. The transport of the tungsten ions is analyzed in the frame of the minimal test particle model that yields this pinch mechanism. We use a semi-analytical method and numerical simulations. The scaling laws of the pinch velocity and of the diffusion coefficient are found and analyzed in order to drive a clear physical image of these non-linear effects. We conclude that the pinch produced by the non-linear interaction of the parallel accelerated motion with the perpendicular transport is rather strong for the heavy impurities.}

	abstract={The transport of low-Z impurities in fusion plasmas is dominated, in many regimes of interest, by ion temperature gradient (ITG) and trapped electron mode (TEM) turbulence. We use a statistical test-particle approach to analyze the effects of these drift instabilities on the transport coefficients. It is found that the convection of E × B motion by the polarization drift drives an outward radial pinch via ITG and an inward pinch via TEM turbulence. Opposite radial pinches are driven by turbulent motion along magnetic field-lines. The interplay between these effects can explain the co-existence of peaked and hollow impurity density profiles observed in tokamak plasmas. The theoretical framework is validated through comparison with experimental data on the transport of Boron impurities.}

    "abstract": "The diffusive transport in two-dimensional incompressible turbulent fields is investigated with the aid of high-quality direct numerical simulations. Three classes of turbulence spectra that are able to capture both short and long-range time-space correlations and oscillating features are employed. We report novel scaling laws that depart from the $γ=7/10$ paradigm of percolative exponents and are dependent on the features of turbulence. A simple relation between diffusion in the percolative and frozen regimes is found. The importance of discerning between differential and integral characteristic scales is emphasized.",

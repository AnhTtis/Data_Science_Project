    "abstract": "The increasing demands for motion control result in a situation where Linear\nParameter-Varying (LPV) dynamics have to be taken into account. Inverse-model\nfeedforward control for LPV motion systems is challenging, since the inverse of\nan LPV system is often dynamically dependent on the scheduling sequence. The\naim of this paper is to develop an identification approach that directly\nidentifies dynamically scheduled feedforward controllers for LPV motion systems\nfrom data. In this paper, the feedforward controller is parameterized in basis\nfunctions, similar to, e.g., mass-acceleration feedforward, and is identified\nby a kernel-based approach such that the parameter dependency for LPV motion\nsystems is addressed. The resulting feedforward includes dynamic dependence and\nis learned accurately. The developed framework is validated on an example.",

abstract = {Feedforward control can effectively compensate for the servo error induced by the reference signal if it is tuned appropriately. This paper aims to introduce a new joint input shaping and feedforward parametrization in iterative feedforward control. Such a parametrization has the potential to significantly improve the performance for systems executing a point-to-point reference trajectory. The proposed approach enables an efficient optimization procedure with global convergence. A simulation example and an experimental validation on an industrial motion system confirm (i) the performance improvement obtained by means of the joint input shaping and feedforward parametrization compared to pre-existing results, and (ii) the efficiency of the proposed optimization procedure. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The identification of linear parameter-varying systems in an input-output setting is investigated, focusing on the case when the noise part of the data generating system is an additive colored noise. In the Box-Jenkins and output-error cases, it is shown that the currently available linear regression and instrumental variable methods from the literature are far from being optimal in terms of bias and variance of the estimates. To overcome the underlying problems, a refined instrumental variable method is introduced.

@article{Darwish2018,
abstract = {In this paper, a Bayesian nonparametric approach is introduced to estimate multi-input multi-output (MIMO) linear parameter-varying (LPV) models under the general noise model structure of Box–Jenkins (BJ) type. The approach is based on the estimation of the one-step-ahead predictor of general LPV-BJ structures. Parts of the predictors associated with the input and output signals are modeled as asymptotically stable infinite impulse response (IIR) models. Then, these IIR models are identified in a completely nonparametric sense: not only the coefficients are estimated as functions, but also the whole time evolution of the impulse response w.r.t. the scheduling signal of the LPV system. In this Bayesian setting, the estimate of the one-step-ahead predictor is a realization from a zero-mean Gaussian random field, where the covariance function is a multidimensional Gaussian kernel that encodes both the possible structural dependencies and the stability of the predictor. Two different kernel formulations are presented for the LPV setting, namely a diagonal (DI) like and tuned/correlated (TC) like kernels, where the TC-like kernel is able to describe the correlation between coefficient functions associated with different time indices. The unknown hyperparameters that parameterize the DI or TC kernel are tuned by maximizing the marginal likelihood w.r.t. the observed data. Moreover, we provide a nonparametric realization scheme to recover the original process and noise IIRs from the identified one-step-ahead predictor. The performance of the presented identification approach is tested on a MIMO LPV-BJ simulation example by means of an extensive Monte-Carlo study.},

abstract = {The theory of fundamental design limitations is well understood for the case that the performance variable is measured for feedback. In the present paper, we extend the theory to systems for which the performance variable is not measured. We consider only the special case for which the performance and measured outputs and the control and exogenous inputs are all scalar signals. The results of the paper depend on the control architecture, specifically, on the location of the sensor relative to the performance output, and the actuator relative to the exogenous input. We show that there may exist a tradeoff between disturbance attenuation and stability robustness that is in addition to the tradeoffs that exist when the performance output is measured. We also develop a set of interpolation constraints that must be satisfied by the disturbance response at certain closed right half plane poles and zeros, and translate these constraints into generalizations of the Bode and Poisson sensitivity integrals. In the absence of problematic interpolation constraints we show that there exists a stabilizing control law that achieves arbitrarily small disturbance response. Depending on the system architecture, this control law will either be high gain feedback or a finite gain controller that depends explicitly on the plant model. We illustrate the results of this paper with the problem of active noise control in an acoustic duct.},

abstract = {To prevent unstable behavior or saturation, a frequency response function (FRF) measurement is often performed under closed-loop conditions (e.g., open-loop gain measurements of an operational amplifier). The difficulty of such FRF measurements is that the nonlinear (NL) distortions also perturb the input via the feedback loop. The latter introduces a bias in the estimate of the best linear approximation (BLA) and jeopardizes the interpretation of the output NL distortions. In this paper, we solve these problems via a generalized definition of the BLA that is valid for NL systems operating in feedback. The classical definition for open-loop systems follows as a special case. {\textcopyright} 1963-2012 IEEE.},

The use of inverse systems can be found in many applications, such as feedforward control and power amplifier predistortion. The inverse model is here estimated with the purpose of using it in cascade with the system itself, as an inverter. A good inverse model in this setting would be one that, when used in series with the original system, reconstructs the original input. The goal here is to select suitable inputs, experimental conditions and loss functions to obtain a good input estimate. Both linear and nonlinear systems will be discussed. For nonlinear systems, one way to obtain a linearizing prefilter is by Hirschorn's algorithm. It is here shown how to extend this to the postdistortion case, and some formulations of how the pre- or postinverter could be estimated are also presented. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {In this paper, the feedforward controller design problem for high-precision electromechanical servo systems that execute finite time tasks is addressed. The presented procedure combines the selection of the fixed structure of the feedforward controller and the optimization of the controller parameters on the basis of measurement data from iterative trials. A linear parameterization of the feedforward controller in a two-degree-of-freedom control architecture is chosen, which for a linear time-invariant (LTI) plant results in a feedforward controller that is applicable to a class of motion profiles as well as in a convex optimization problem with the objective function being a quadratic function of the tracking error. Optimization by iterative trials results in the controller parameter values that are optimal with respect to the actual plant, which leads to a high tracking performance. The use of iterative trials in general outperforms techniques that are based on a detailed a priori plant model only, whereas the fixed structure of the feedforward controller, i.e., the approximative inverse plant model, guarantees a high tracking performance for a class of motion profiles, unlike for example iterative learning control (ILC). Experimental results on a high-precision wafer stage illustrate the procedure. {\textcopyright}2007 IEEE.},

abstract = {Accurate frequency-domain system identification demands for reliable computational algorithms. The aim of this paper is to develop a new algorithm for parametric system identification with favorable convergence properties and optimal numerical conditioning. Recent results in frequency-domain instrumental variable identification are exploited, which lead to enhanced convergence properties compared to classical identification algorithms. In addition, bi-orthonormal polynomials with respect to a data-dependent bi-linear form are introduced for system identification. Hereby, optimal numerical conditioning of the relevant system of equations is achieved. This is shown to be particularly important for the class of instrumental variable algorithms, for which numerical conditioning is typically quadratic compared to alternative frequency-domain identification algorithms. Superiority of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by means of both simulation and experimental results.},

The fact that most new industrial controllers are digital provides strong motivation for adapting or extending these techniques to digital control systems. This book, now available as a corrected reprint, attempts to do so. Part I presents two indirect methods of sampled-data controller design: These approaches include approximations to a real problem, which involves an analogue plant, continuous-time performance specifications, and a sampled-data controller. Part II proposes a direct attack in the continuous-time domain, where sampled-data systems are time-varying. The findings are presented in forms that can readily be programmed in, e.g., MATLAB.},

@article{Toth2012,
abstract = {A common problem in the context of linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems is how input-output (IO) models can be efficiently realized in terms of state-space (SS) representations. The problem originates from the fact that in the LPV literature discrete-time identification and modeling of LPV systems is often accomplished via IO model structures. However, to utilize these LPV-IO models for control synthesis, commonly it is required to transform them into an equivalent SS form. In general, such a transformation is complicated due to the phenomenon of dynamic dependence (dependence of the resulting representation on time-shifted versions of the scheduling signal). This conversion problem is revisited and practically applicable approaches are suggested which result in discrete-time SS representations that have only static dependence (dependence on the instantaneous value of the scheduling signal). To circumvent complexity, a criterion is also established to decide when an linear-time invariant (LTI)-type of realization approach can be used without introducing significant approximation error. To reduce the order of the resulting SS realization, an LPV Ho-Kalman-type of model reduction approach is introduced, which, besides its simplicity, is capable of reducing even non-stable plants. The proposed approaches are illustrated by application oriented examples. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

abstract = {Reinforcement Learning is a class of problems frequently encountered by both biological and artificial agents. An important algorithmic component of many Reinforcement Learning solution methods is the estimation of state or state-action values of a fixed policy controlling a Markov decision process (MDP), a task known as policy evaluation. We present a novel Bayesian approach to policy evaluation in general state and action spaces, which employs statistical generative models for value functions via Gaussian processes (GPs). The posterior distribution based on a GP-based statistical model provides us with a value-function estimate, as well as a measure of the variance of that estimate, opening the way to a range of possibilities not available up to now. We derive exact expressions for the posterior moments of the value GP, which admit both batch and recursive computations. An efficient sequential kernel sparsification method allows us to derive efficient online algorithms for learning good approximations of the posterior moments. By allowing our algorithms to evaluate state-action values we derive model-free algorithms based on Policy Iteration for improving policies, thus tackling the complete RL problem.

The work described here has a resemblance to work in psychology, but differs considerably in the details and in the use of the word "reinforcement." The paper discusses central issues of reinforcement learning, including trading off exploration and exploitation, establishing the foundations of the field via Markov decision theory, learning from delayed reinforcement, constructing empirical models to accelerate learning, making use of generalization and hierarchy, and coping with hidden state. It concludes with a survey of some implemented systems and an assessment of the practical utility of current methods for reinforcement learning.},

abstract = {Feedback control is able to improve the performance of systems in the presence of uncertain dynamical behavior and disturbances. Although a properly designed con- troller can cope with large uncertainty, certain knowledge regarding the system be- havior is crucial for control design. Hence, high performance control design requires a mathematical model of the true system. System identification is a reliable, fast, and inexpensive methodology to construct accurate models from experimentally obtained data. The resulting model, however, is never an exact representation of the physical system. Robust control design can be employed to deal with the model imperfections by guaranteeing a certain performance for an uncertain model set. ntification and robust control is untransparent. To connect system identification and robust control in a coherent methodology, the pursued approach involves 1. improved system identification methodologies for nominal models; 2. quantification of model uncertainty by confronting the identified model with new measurement data to test its predictive power, as a result a model set is obtained that encompasses the true system behavior; 3. the design of a robust controller that performs well with the entire model set, hence also when implemented on the true system. New theoretical developments and algorithms are presented that transparently connect Steps 1, 2, and 3.},

Different from conventional methods such as state augmentation, an algorithm solving the sensor sampling mismatch issues in a single step is proposed. To design the estimator, a combined vision-vehicle model for lateral vehicle state estimation is first introduced, and the multirate and uneven sampling delay problems are explained from the perspectives of sensor fusion. Then, a measurement reconstruction algorithm with intersample compensation is introduced to solve the sensor measurement mismatch issue. Using this method, vehicle lateral states such as lateral position to the lane and heading angle can be updated faster and more reliably.

In this paper, such a nonparametric approach is applied to the design of optimal predictors and discrete-time models based on prediction error minimization by interpreting the predictor impulse responses as realizations of Gaussian processes. The proposed scheme describes the predictor impulse responses as the convolution of an infinite-dimensional response with a low-dimensional parametric response that captures possible high-frequency dynamics. Overparameterization is avoided because the model involves only a few hyperparameters that are tuned via marginal likelihood maximization. Numerical experiments, with data generated by ARMAX and infinite-dimensional models, show the definite advantages of the new approach over standard parametric prediction error techniques and subspace methods both in terms of predictive capability on new data and accuracy in reconstruction of system impulse responses. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We use a POMDP with a utility function that depends on the belief state to model the finite horizon planning problem. We replan as the robot progresses throughout the environment. The POMDP is high-dimensional, continuous, non-differentiable, nonlinear, non-Gaussian and must be solved in real-time. Most existing techniques for stochastic planning and reinforcement learning are therefore inapplicable. To solve this extremely complex problem, we propose a Bayesian optimization method that dynamically trades off exploration (minimizing uncertainty in unknown parts of the policy space) and exploitation (capitalizing on the current best solution). We demonstrate our approach with a visually-guide mobile robot.

The aim of this paper is first to show that the pre-existing ILC controllers may not be directly implementable in this setting, and second to develop a new approach that enables the use of different variables for feedback and batch-to-batch control. The analysis reveals that by using pre-existing ILC methods, the ILC and feedback controllers may not be stable in an inferential setting. Therefore, the complete closed-loop system is cast in a 2D framework to analyze stability. Several solution strategies are outlined. The analysis is illustrated through an application example in a printing system. Finally, the developed theory also leads to new results for traditional ILC algorithms in the common situation where the feedback controller contains a pure integrator.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Iterative Learning Control (ILC) enables high control performance through learning from measured data, using limited model knowledge, typically in the form of a nominal parametric model. Robust stability requires robustness to modeling errors, often due to deliberate undermode-ling. The aim of this chapter is to outline a range of design approaches for multivariable ILC that is suited for engineering applications, with specific attention to addressing interaction using limited model knowledge. The proposed methods either address the interaction in the nominal model, or as uncertainty, i.e., through robust stability. The result is a range of techniques, including the use of the structured singular value (SSV) and Gershgorin bounds, that provide a different trade-off between modeling requirements, i.e., modeling effort and cost, and achievable performance. This allows control engineers to select the approach that fits best the modeling budget and control requirements. This trade-off is demonstrated in case studies on industrial printers. Additionally, two learning approaches are presented that are compatible with, and provide extensions to, the developed multivariable design framework: model-free iterative learning, and ILC for varying tasks.},

abstract = {Measurements in chemical processes are often unavailable at a uniform rate due to constraints on the sampling rates of process variables. Situations such as these and others give rise to a set of multirate signals comprising a multirate system. Control of multirate systems is appealing and challenging from a theoretical and practical point of view. Multirate control design in the lifting framework consists of lifting the system and subsequently designing a controller for the single-rate lifted system. In this work, it is shown that under certain conditions, intersample ripples arise in the outputs of closed-loop multirate systems. The process output can be guaranteed to be ripple-free if the controller satisfies certain constraints. Further, it is shown that the presence of an integrator in the plant aids in eliminating these intersample ripples. Experimental evaluations are presented in support of these theoretical results. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Intrigued by some recent results on impulse response estimation by kernel and nonparametric techniques, we revisit the old problem of transfer function estimation from input-output measurements. We formulate a classical regularization approach, focused on finite impulse response (FIR) models, and find that regularization is necessary to cope with the high variance problem. This basic, regularized least squares approach is then a focal point for interpreting other techniques, like Bayesian inference and Gaussian process regression. The main issue is how to determine a suitable regularization matrix (Bayesian prior or kernel). Several regularization matrices are provided and numerically evaluated on a data bank of test systems and data sets. Our findings based on the data bank are as follows. The classical regularization approach with carefully chosen regularization matrices shows slightly better accuracy and clearly better robustness in estimating the impulse response than the standard approach-the prediction error method/maximum likelihood (PEM/ML) approach. If the goal is to estimate a model of given order as well as possible, a low order model is often better estimated by the PEM/ML approach, and a higher order model is often better estimated by model reduction on a high order regularized FIR model estimated with careful regularization. Moreover, an optimal regularization matrix that minimizes the mean square error matrix is derived and studied. The importance of this result lies in that it gives the theoretical upper bound on the accuracy that can be achieved for this classical regularization approach. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper we consider positioning devices in IC-manufacturing for which position-dependent plant dynamics are a performance limiting factor. We suggested to employ recently developed linear parameter varying (LPV) control techniques for designing position-dependent controllers that adapt themselves in order to achieve optimal closed-loop performance. Our main emphasis is on presenting a practical LPV design procedure which covers plant modeling, controller synthesis and actual implementation for an electromechanical positioning device, an advanced wafer-scanner. Our experimental results reveal that performance can be improved by LPV control if compared to a classical SISO design. We highlight a variety of troublesome aspects within the design cycle that lack a systematic theoretically founded solution and that limit the possible performance improvement achievable by LPV control. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a nonparametric approach in a Bayesian setting to efficiently estimate, both in the stochastic and computational sense, linear parameter-varying (LPV) input-output models under general noise conditions of Box-Jenkins (BJ) type. The approach is based on the estimation of the one-step-ahead predictor model of general LPV-BJ structures, where the sub-predictors associated with the input and output signals are captured as asymptotically stable infinite impulse response models (IIRs). These IIR sub-predictors are identified in a completely nonparametric sense, where not only the coefficients are estimated as functions, but also the whole time evolution of the impulse response is estimated as a function. In this Bayesian setting, the one-step-ahead predictor is modelled as a zero-mean Gaussian random field, where the covariance function is a multidimensional Gaussian kernel that encodes both the possible structural dependencies and the stability of the predictor. The unknown hyperparameters that parameterize the kernel are tuned using the empirical Bayes approach, i.e., optimization of the marginal likelihood with respect to available data. It is also shown that, in case the predictor has a finite order, i.e., the true system has an ARX noise structure, our approach is able to recover the underlying structural dependencies. The performance of the identification method is demonstrated on LPV-ARX and LPV-BJ simulation examples by means of a Monte Carlo study.},

Since the impulse response model is a special case of orthonormal basis functions, it is interesting to consider if it is possible to tackle the regularized system identification using more compact orthonormal basis functions. In this paper, we explore two possibilities. First, we construct reproducing kernel Hilbert space of impulse responses by orthonormal basis functions and then use the induced reproducing kernel for the regularized impulse response estimation. Second, we extend the regularization method from impulse response estimation to the more general orthonormal basis functions estimation. For both cases, the poles of the basis functions are treated as hyper-parameters and estimated by empirical Bayes method. Then we further show that the former is a special case of the latter, and more specifically, the former is equivalent to ridge regression of the coefficients of the orthonormal basis functions.},

abstract = {There is a well-developed theory describing inherent design limitations for linear time invariant feedback systems consisting of an analogue plant and analogue controller. This theory describes limitations on achievable performance present when the plant has non-minimum phase zeros, unstable poles, and/or time delays. The parallel theory for linear time invariant discrete time systems is less interesting because it describes system behaviour only at sampling instants. This paper develops a theory of design limitations for sampled-data feedback systems wherein the response of the analogue system output is considered. This is done using the fact that the steady-state response of a hybrid feedback system to a sinusoidal input consists of a fundamental component at the frequency of the input together with infinitely many harmonics at frequencies spaced integer multiples of the sampling frequency away from the fundamental. This fact allows fundamental sensitivity and complementary sensitivity functions that relate the fundamental component of the response to the input signal to be defined. These sensitivity and complementary sensitivity functions must satisfy integral relations analogous to the Bode and Poisson integrals for purely analogue systems. The relations show, for example, that design limitations due to non-minimum phase zeros of the analogue plant constrain the response of the sampled-data feedback system regardless of whether the discretized system is minimum phase and independently of the choice of hold function. {\textcopyright} 1995 Taylor & Francis Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper develops a frequency-domain theory that provides a method to analyze and design sampled-data control systems, including their intersample behaviors. The key idea is to consider the signal space script X sign$\phi$$\Delta$ = {x(t) | x(t) = $\Sigma$∝n= -∝ xn exp(j$\phi$t + jn$\omega$st),$\Sigma$∝n=-∝ ∥Xn ∥2 < ∞}, where $\omega$s is the sampling angular frequency. It is shown that a stable sampled-data system equipped with a strictly-proper pre-filter before the sampler maps script X sign$\phi$ into script X sign$\phi$ ≡l2) in the steady state. That mapping is denoted by script Q sign(j$\phi$) and is referred to as an 'FR operator'. It is proved that the norm of the sampled-data system as an operator from L2 to L2 is given by max$\phi$ ∥script Q sign(j$\phi$)∥I2II2, where -1/2$\omega$s< $\phi$ ≤ 1/2$\omega$s. A set of equations relating outputs of a closed-loop system to its inputs in the frequency domain is derived, and their solution is given in an explicit form. Based on that solution, the sensitivity FR operator script L sign(j$\phi$) and the complementary sensitivity FR operator script T sign(j$\phi$) are defined for feedback control systems, and it is shown that script L sign(j$\phi$) gives the improvement of the sensitivity of the transfer characteristics from the reference to the controlled output and also represents the ability of rejecting disturbances, and that script T sign(j$\phi$) represents the degree of robust stability and, at the same time, gives the effect of detection noises. It is also shown that script L sign(j$\phi$) + script T sign(j$\phi$) = ℐ, and thus a frequency-domain paradigm for the design of sampled-data control systems, which is exactly parallel to the continuous-time case, is established.},

abstract = {This paper describes a new kernel-based approach for linear system identification of stable systems. We model the impulse response as the realization of a Gaussian process whose statistics, differently from previously adopted priors, include information not only on smoothness but also on BIBO-stability. The associated autocovariance defines what we call a stable spline kernel. The corresponding minimum variance estimate belongs to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space which is spectrally characterized. Compared to parametric identification techniques, the impulse response of the system is searched for within an infinite-dimensional space, dense in the space of continuous functions. Overparametrization is avoided by tuning few hyperparameters via marginal likelihood maximization. The proposed approach may prove particularly useful in the context of robust identification in order to obtain reduced order models by exploiting a two-step procedure that projects the nonparametric estimate onto the space of nominal models. The continuous-time derivation immediately extends to the discrete-time case. On several continuous- and discrete-time benchmarks taken from the literature the proposed approach compares very favorably with the existing parametric and nonparametric techniques. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

An approach for non-parametric identification is developed that is particularly suitable for thermal aspects in mechatronic systems. In particular (1) reduced experiment time is achieved by utilizing transient data in the identification procedure. (2) an approach is presented that exploits measured ambient air temperature fluctuations as additional inputs to the identification setup. (3) the non-parametric model, obtained through (1) and (2), is used as a basis for parameter estimation of a grey-box parametric model. The presented methods form a complete framework that facilitates the implementation of advanced control techniques and error compensation strategies by providing high-fidelity models, enabling increased accuracy and throughput in high precision motion control.},

abstract = {The paper deals with the stabilizability of linear plants whose parameters vary with time in a compact set. First, necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a linear gain-scheduled stabilizing compensator are given. Next, it is shown that, if these conditions are satisfied, any compensator transfer function depending on the plant parameters and internally stabilizing the closed-loop control system when the plant parameters are constant, can be realized in such a way that the closed-loop asymptotic stability is guaranteed under arbitrary parameter variations. To this purpose, it is preliminarily proved that any transfer function that is stable for all constant parameters values admits a realization that is stable under arbitrary parameter variations (linear parameter-varying (LPV) stability). Then, the YoulaKucera parametrization of all stabilizing compensators is exploited; precisely, closed-loop LPV stability can be ensured by taking an LPV stable realization of the YoulaKucera parameter. To find one such realization, a reasonably simple and general algorithm based on Lyapunov equations and Cholesky's factorization is provided. These results can be exploited to apply linear time-invarient design to LPV systems, thus achieving both pointwise optimality (or pole placement) and LPV stability. Some potential applications in adaptive control and online tuning are pointed out. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

In particular, alias-components are related to the time-shifted versions of the system. It is shown that in general, a filterbank is equivalent to the cascade connection of two LPTV systems. By generalizing some of the results of the LSTV representation of LPTV systems, it is shown that for relatively coprime integers p and m, a p-channel filterbank that has LPTV filters with period m is equivalent to an mp-channel filterbank with LTI filters. The representation of multirate systems that have LPTV kernels is discussed next. Due to the presence of the upsampler and downsampler, there are some degrees of freedom in the choice of the kernel. This redundancy will be dealt with by choosing from various subclasses so that there is a one-to-one relationship between a multirate system and its kernel. Then, we find the LPTV kernel that has the least period.},

abstract = {In this article, we discuss iterative learning control (ILC) for systems with input/output (i/o) basis functions. First, we show that various different ILC formulations in the literature can be captured by a common system representation involving i/o basis functions. Analysis of ILC control objectives in this framework yields ILC controller conditions which are required for convergence and optimal performance. Furthermore, analysis reveals how different ILC objectives (monotonic convergence, performance, minimisation of input amplitudes) can be reached by designing separate parts of the ILC controller. The analysis is subsequently expanded by studying the effects of trial-varying disturbances on performance, which results in suggestions for the compensation of these effects. Finally, we use these results to systematically design ILC controllers for the representation under study, and we show that the found results are applicable to existing ILC problem formulations with i/o basis functions, and problem formulations which can be interpreted as such.},

Specifically, we define the average-power gain matrix, which for a periodic operator characterizes the average power of the asymptotic (`steady-state') response to a sinusoidal input of a single frequency.

abstract = {In many control applications, it is attractive to describe nonlinear (NL) and time-varying (TV) plants by linear parameter-varying (LPV) models and design controllers based on such representations to regulate the behavior of the system. The LPV system class offers the representation of NL and TV phenomena as a linear dynamic relationship between input and output signals, which is dependent on some measurable signals, e.g.; operating conditions, often called as scheduling variables. For such models, powerful control synthesis tools are available, but the way how to systematically convert available first principles models to LPV descriptions of the plant, to efficiently identify LPV models for control from data and to understand how modeling errors affect the control performance are still subject of undergoing research. Therefore, it is attractive to synthesize the controller directly from data without the need of modeling the plant and addressing the underlying difficulties. Hence, in this paper, a novel data-driven synthesis scheme is proposed in a stochastic framework to provide a practically applicable solution for synthesizing LPV controllers directly from data. Both the cases of fixed order controller tuning and controller structure learning are discussed and two different design approaches are provided. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is also illustrated by means of an academic example and a real application based simulation case study.},

In these settings, a fundamental question is when an active learning, or sequential design, strategy, where locations are selected based on previous measurements, will perform significantly better than sensing at an a priori specified set of locations. For Gaussian Processes (GPs), which often accurately model spatial phenomena, we present an analysis and efficient algorithms that address this question. Central to our analysis is a theoretical bound which quantifies the performance difference between active and a priori design strategies. We consider GPs with unknown kernel parameters and present a nonmyopic approach for trading off exploration, i.e., decreasing uncertainty about the model parameters, and exploitation, i.e., near-optimally selecting observations when the parameters are (approximately) known. We discuss several exploration strategies, and present logarithmic sample complexity bounds for the exploration phase. We then extend our algorithm to handle nonstationary GPs exploiting local structure in the model. We also present extensive empirical evaluation on several real-world problems.},

Allowing extra actuators in the design makes it possible to overcome this limitation. In this way the controllability of the internal dynamics of the structure can be both maximized for feedback and minimized for feedforward. By tuning a static relation between the actuators it is possible to minimize the excitation of resonances in the feedforward path. Feedback controller design is based on an existing vibration control strategy, which enables placement of the bandwidth beyond the lowest resonance frequencies.

If measurements of input X and output Y are confounded, the causal relationship can nonetheless be identified if an instrumental variable Z is available that influences X directly, but is conditionally independent of Y given X and the unmeasured confounder. The classic two-stage least squares algorithm (2SLS) simplifies the estimation problem by modeling all relationships as linear functions. We propose kernel instrumental variable regression (KIV), a nonparametric generalization of 2SLS, modeling relations among X, Y, and Z as nonlinear functions in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs). We prove the consistency of KIV under mild assumptions, and derive conditions under which convergence occurs at the minimax optimal rate for unconfounded, single-stage RKHS regression. In doing so, we obtain an efficient ratio between training sample sizes used in the algorithm's first and second stages. In experiments, KIV outperforms state of the art alternatives for nonparametric IV regression.},

First, a prior distribution over the nonlinear functions representing the unknown coefficient dependencies of the model to be estimated is defined; then, a posterior distribution of these functions is obtained given measured data. The mean value of the posterior distribution is used to provide a model estimate. The approach is formulated with both static and dynamic dependency of the coefficient functions on the scheduling variables. The properties and performance of the proposed method are evaluated using illustrative examples.},

The aim of this paper is to develop a kernel-based iterative learning control (ILC) approach that enables the specification of parameters through suitable kernels. The developed kernel-based iterative learning control (KILC) framework employs basis functions to facilitate task flexibility and nonlinear and non-causal feedforward as function of the reference signal. Experimental results on a printer motion system subject to nonlinear friction demonstrate that the developed framework is capable of achieving improved performance for systems with non-minimum phase and higher-order dynamics compared to preexisting feedforward methods.},

abstract = {An inversion procedure is introduced for nonlinear systems which constructs a bounded input trajectory in the preimage of a desired output trajectory. In the case of minimum phase systems, the trajectory produced agrees with that generated by Hirschorn's inverse dynamic system; however, the preimage trajectory is noncausal (rather than unstable) in the nonminimum phase case. In addition, the analysis leads to a simple geometric connection between the unstable manifold of the system zero dynamics and noncausality in the nonminimum phase case. With the addition of stabilizing feedback to the preimage trajectory, asymptotically exact output tracking is achieved. Tracking is demonstrated with a numerical example and compared to the well-known Byrnes-Isidori regulator. Rather than solving a partial differential equation to construct a regulator, the inverse is calculated using a Picard-like interaction. When preactuation is not possible, noncausal inverse trajectories can be truncated resulting in the tracking-error transients found in other control schemes. {\textcopyright} 1996 IEEE.},

Since these points are typically not measured directly, high performance local control of measured positions may lead to deteriorated performance due to internal deformations. A possible solution is to employ a control strategy which ensures that the desired rigid body motion is achieved, without exciting the parasitic flexible dynamics. In this paper, a feedforward controller design procedure is developed that achieves this type of global performance, which in turn leads to increased performance at the unmeasured positions of interest. The proposed method is applied to an experimental wafer stage showing that the proposed approach indeed leads to superior results with respect to the traditional local control approach.},

Using a lightweight robot that was especially designed for interactive and cooperative tasks, we show how reactive control strategies can significantly contribute to ensuring safety to the human during physical interaction. Several collision tests were carried out, illustrating the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. While a subjective "safety" feeling is experienced by users when being able to naturally stop the robot in autonomous motion, a quantitative analysis of different reaction strategies was lacking. In order to compare these strategies on an objective basis, a mechanical verification platform has been built. The proposed collision detection and reactions methods prove to work very reliably and are effective in reducing contact forces far below any level which is dangerous to humans. Evaluations of impacts between robot and human arm or chest up to a maximum robot velocity of 2.7 m/s are presented. {\textcopyright}2008 IEEE.},

abstract = {Model predictive control (MPC) has a long history in the field of control en- gineering. It is one of the few areas that has received on-going interest from researchers in both the industrial and academic communities. Four major as- pects of model predictive control make the design methodology attractive to both practitioners and academics. The first aspect is the design formulation, which uses a completely multivariable system framework where the perfor- mance parameters of the multivariable control system are related to the engi- neering aspects of the system; hence, they can be understood and ‘tuned' by engineers. The second aspect is the ability of the method to handle both ‘soft' constraints and hard constraints in a multivariable control framework. This is particularly attractive to industry where tight profit margins and limits on the process operation are inevitably present. The third aspect is the ability to perform on-line process optimization. The fourth aspect is the simplicity of the design framework in handling all these complex issues. This book gives an introduction to model predictive control, and recent developments in design and implementation. Beginning with an overview of the field, the book will systematically cover topics in receding horizon con- trol, MPC design formulations, constrained control, Laguerre-function-based predictive control, predictive control using exponential data weighting, refor- mulation of classical predictive control, tuning of predictive control, as well as simulation and implementation using MATLAB and SIMULINK as a platform. Both continuous-time and discrete-time model predictive control is presented in a similar framework.},

Though the polynomiality of these algorithms depends on the degree of approximation $\epsilon$ being fixed, they cannot be improved, owing to a negative result stating that there are no fully polynomial approximation schemes for strongly NP-complete problems unless NP = P. The unified technique that is introduced here, referred to as the shifting strategy, is applicable to numerous geometric covering and packing problems. The method of using the technique and how it varies with problem parameters are illustrated. A similar technique, independently devised by B. S.

abstract = {Iterative learning control (ILC) is subject to a trade-off between effective compensation of repeating disturbances, and amplification of non-repeating disturbances. Although important progress has been made in enhancing the flexibility of ILC to non-repeating tasks by means of basis functions, at present high performance comes at the cost of non-convex optimization. The aim of this paper is to develop a convex approach to ILC with rational basis functions. A key aspect of the proposed approach is the use of orthonormal basis functions in L2, such that non-causal control actions can be utilized. The benefits of using non-causal rational basis functions in ILC are demonstrated by means of a relevant example.},

In this paper we present the paradigm and revise underlying technical tools, such as the lifting technique and some topics of the operator theory.

This paper aims to develop a new procedure to tune a feedforward controller based on measured data obtained in finite time tasks. Hereto, a suitable feedforward parametrization is introduced that provides good extrapolation properties for a class of reference signals. Next, connections with closed-loop system identification are established. In particular, instrumental variables, which have been proven very useful in closed-loop system identification, are selected to tune the feedforward controller. These instrumental variables closely resemble traditional engineering tuning practice. In contrast to pre-existing approaches, the feedforward controller can be updated after each task, irrespective of noise acting on the system. Experimental results confirm the practical relevance of the proposed method.},

Parallel to this, in the machine learning community alternative techniques have been developed. Until recently, there has been little contact between these two worlds. The first aim of this survey is to make accessible to the control community the key mathematical tools and concepts as well as the computational aspects underpinning these learning techniques. In particular, we focus on kernel-based regularization and its connections with reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and Bayesian estimation of Gaussian processes.

abstract = {Although kernel methods have been successfully applied to many different problems in system identification, choosing an optimal kernel structure can be challenging - particularly in higher-order problems. However by noting that structural information, such as linearity, separability and smoothness, is contained in the functional derivatives, it can be seen that the kernel selection problem can be reduced to a simpler regularisation problem over specified derivatives. In this vein, here a novel approach to the control of smoothness in nonparametric LPV identification is proposed. By constraining the derivatives of the scheduling dependencies through a regularisation term, the model smoothness can be linearly controlled through the regularisation hyper parameter, without needing to optimise over the kernel function. A simulation example is presented to show how different structural hypotheses can be tested at minimal extra cost to the user, with the proposed approaches validated against a method from the literature.},

The worst-case performance is compared for two cases: 1) with the use of feedback alone and 2) with the addition of the feedforward input. It is shown that inversion-based feedforward controllers can lead to performance improvements at frequencies $\omega$ where the uncertainty $\Delta$(j$\omega$) in the nominal plant is smaller than the size of the nominal plant G0(j$\omega$) divided by its condition number $\kappa$G0 (j$\omega$), i.e., ||$\Delta$ (j$\omega$) ||2 < || G0 (j$\omega$)||2/$\kappa$G0 (j$\omega$).

abstract = {Least-Squares Support Vector Machines (LS-SVMs), originating from Statistical Learning and Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) theories, represent a promising approach to identify nonlinear systems via nonparametric estimation of the involved nonlinearities in a computationally and stochastically attractive way. However, application of LS-SVMs and other RKHS variants in the identification context is formulated as a regularized linear regression aiming at the minimization of the ℓ2 loss of the prediction error. This formulation corresponds to the assumption of an auto-regressive noise structure, which is often found to be too restrictive in practical applications. In this paper, Instrumental Variable (IV) based estimation is integrated into the LS-SVM approach, providing, under minor conditions, consistent identification of nonlinear systems regarding the noise modeling error. It is shown how the cost function of the LS-SVM is modified to achieve an IV-based solution. Although, a practically well applicable choice of the instrumental variable is proposed for the derived approach, optimal choice of this instrument in terms of the estimates associated variance still remains to be an open problem. The effectiveness of the proposed IV based LS-SVM scheme is also demonstrated by a Monte Carlo study based simulation example.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a new methodology in linear time-periodic (LTP) system identification. In contrast to previous methods that totally separate dynamics at different tag times for identification, the method focuses on imposing appropriate structural constraints on the linear time-invariant (LTI) reformulation of LTP systems. This method adopts a periodically-switched truncated infinite impulse response model for LTP systems, where the structural constraints are interpreted as the requirement to place the poles of the non-truncated models at the same locations for all sub-models. This constraint is imposed by combining the atomic norm regularization framework for LTI systems with the group lasso technique in regression. As a result, the estimated system is both uniform and low-order, which is hard to achieve with other existing estimators. Monte Carlo simulation shows that the grouped atomic norm method does not only show better results compared to other regularized methods, but also outperforms the subspace identification method under high noise levels in terms of model fitting.},

abstract = {Recently, smart system integration was identified as a key competence for optimizing machines and robots. However, when one wants to 'tune' the entire production process a step further is necessary. We should evaluate performance indicators (e.g. energy and material consumption) over the whole machine life cycle in order to align the production with circular economy principles. To reach that target MBSE (model-based system engineering) should be covered by advanced digital twin approaches which allow continuous monitoring of machine performance, predict the failures and maintenance. Moreover, artificial intelligence and machine learning must be used to process big data sets gathered from the production lines. This paper identifies a common set of technologies and building blocks suitable to solve above mentioned problems for a large variety of industrial domains (semiconductor production, health-care robotics, CNC1 machining, high-speed packaging and others). It presents the first results of the large-scale IMOCO4.E2 project and shows the pathways for application of the technology on specific machines (so-called pilots).

abstract = {Iterative learning control (ILC) algorithms are typically used to iteratively refine the feed-forward control input to a system to achieve an optimized performance objective. Because of its ease of implementation and robustness, ILC has found widespread use in a variety of industrial applications. However, a key limitation of ILC is the requirement that learning has to be re-initiated for each new trajectory, since the tuned control input corresponds to a specific reference trajectory. Thus, the entire tuning process needs to be repeated to generate a new control input even with slight changes in the reference trajectory. This problem is especially critical for applications where the motion trajectories required for different tasks are different. In this paper, we address this issue by designing an algorithm for iteratively learning a system dynamics-related model that is portable from one trajectory to another, namely, a finite length approximation of the impulse response of the inverse of the system. This learned approximation of the inverse model can then be transferred to a new trajectory without relearning. We present theoretical development of convergence, robustness, and performance bounds of the proposed algorithm. Finally, the proposed algorithm is verified both in simulation and implementation on a high precision positioning stage. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Automatic Control Council.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new methodology for synthesizing a static inferential-feedforward control scheme for petroleum fractionator fed with undefined blended mixture of hydrocarbons. Traditional steady-state analysis are used to evaluate two control schemes, direct and indirect products quality control schemes. Results indicate that despite the simplicity of implementation of the indirect quality control scheme which infers unmeasurable products quality from secondary measurements, it is very sensitive to modeling errors, and therefore the direct quality control scheme is more favorable. In order to compensate for undesirable time delays caused by the on-line composition analysers in the direct quality feedback control scheme, methods are presented to design an inferential-feedforward control structure that infers unmeasurable feed composition disturbances from secondary measurements and adjusts the nominal feedforward ratios of the manipulated variables to the feed flow rate, to maintain the desired products quality. First, the feed composition is represented by three groups, namely, paraffins, naphthenes, and aromatics (PNA). Then, the sensitivity analysis via a steady-state simulation are used in determining how the nominal feedforward ratios can be adapted. Singular value decomposition (SVD) technique is performed to select two tray temperatures which can detect changes in the PNA composition of the feed. This proposed structure consists of correlations obtained by running a simulation of the column, and has a great potential for enhancing the performance of the direct quality feedback control scheme.

abstract = {When monitoring spatial phenomena, which can often be modeled as Gaussian processes (GPs), choosing sensor locations is a fundamental task. There are several common strategies to address this task, for example, geometry or disk models, placing sensors at the points of highest entropy (variance) in the GP model, and A-, D-, or E-optimal design. In this paper, we tackle the combinatorial optimization problem of maximizing the mutual information between the chosen locations and the locations which are not selected. We prove that the problem of finding the configuration that maximizes mutual information is NP-complete. To address this issue, we describe a polynomial-time approximation that is within (1 - 1/e) of the optimum by exploiting the submodularity of mutual information. We also show how submodularity can be used to obtain online bounds, and design branch and bound search procedures. We then extend our algorithm to exploit lazy evaluations and local structure in the GP, yielding significant speedups. We also extend our approach to find placements which are robust against node failures and uncertainties in the model. These extensions are again associated with rigorous theoretical approximation guarantees, exploiting the submodularity of the objective function. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach towards optimizing mutual information in a very extensive empirical study on two real-world data sets.},

abstract = {Nonequidistant sampling potentially enhances the performance/cost trade-off that is present in traditional equidistant sampling schemes. The aim of this paper is to develop a systematic feedback control design approach for systems that go beyond equidistant sampling. A loop-shaping design framework for such nonequidistantly sampled systems is developed that addresses both stability and performance. The framework only requires frequency response function measurements of the LTI system, whereas it appropriately addresses the linear periodically time-varying behavior introduced by the nonequidistant sampling. Experimental validation on a motion system demonstrates the superiority of the design framework for nonequidistantly sampled systems compared to traditional designs that rely on equidistant sampling.},

abstract = {Mechatronic systems have increasingly high performance requirements for motion control. The low-frequency contribution of the flexible dynamics, i.e. the compliance, should be compensated for by means of snap feedforward to achieve high accuracy. Position-dependent compliance, which often occurs in motion systems, requires the snap feedforward parameter to be modeled as a function of position. Position-dependent compliance is compensated for by using a Gaussian process to model the snap feedforward parameter as a continuous function of position. A simulation of a flexible beam shows that a significant performance increase is achieved when using the Gaussian process snap feedforward parameter to compensate for position-dependent compliance.},

abstract = {Inspired by the recent promising developments of Bayesian learning techniques in the context of system identification, this paper proposes a Transfer Function estimator, based on Gaussian process regression. Contrary to existing kernel-based impulse response estimators, a frequency domain approach is adopted. This leads to a formulation and implementation which is seamlessly valid for both continuous- and discrete-time systems, and which conveniently enables the selection of the frequency band of interest. A pragmatic approach is proposed in an output error framework, from sampled input and output data. The transient is dealt with by estimating it simultaneously with the transfer function. Modelling the transfer function and the transient as Gaussian processes allows for the incorporation of relevant prior knowledge on the system, in the form of suitably designed kernels. The SS (Stable Spline) and DC (Diagonal Correlated) kernels from the literature are translated to the frequency domain, and are proven to impose the stability of the estimated transfer function. Specifically, the estimates are shown to be stable rational functions in the frequency variable. The hyperparameters of the kernel are tuned via marginal likelihood maximisation. The comparison between the proposed method and three existing methods from the literature–the regularised finite impulse response (RFIR) estimator, the Local Polynomial Method (LPM), and the Local Rational Method for Frequency Response Function estimation–is illustrated on simulations on multiple case studies.},

The approach uses a synchronous permanent magnet planar motor, where the magnets are located in the stationary part and the coils are mounted on one moving yoke. A cross winding technology with concentrated windings is implemented to realize a compact feed drive for machine tools. An experimental setup was used to obtain the characteristic behavior of the inductance and disturbance- and feed-force deviation of the drive. Disturbance-forces like cogging- and detent-forces occur due to parasitic effects between the permanent magnets and the iron based yoke. It is theoretically and experimentally shown, that both winding layers marginally interact. Based on the identified characteristics, two independent cascade control systems are developed. The disturbance-force is compensated by a feedforward control. The performance of this first prototype is finally shown in a circular milling setup.},

The kernel structure and the unknown hyperparameters are estimated maximizing their marginal likelihood so that the user is not required to define any part of the algorithmic architecture, e.g., the regressors and the model order. Once the kernel is estimated, the nonlinear model is obtained solving a Tikhonov-type variational problem. The Hilbert space the estimator belongs to is characterized.

The proposed technique extends the preview-based stable-inversion method to optimally utilize finite-preview (in time) of the future desired output trajectory to find the feedforward input (called the inverse input) for achieving precision output tracking for nonminimum-phase systems. It has been shown that having a large enough preview time is critical to ensure the precision in the preview-based output tracking. The available preview time, however, can be limited due to the physical constraints, and more generally, the associated cost and/or hardware limits. Therefore, we propose obtaining the optimal preview-based inverse input by minimizing, within the preview time window, the predicted tracking error (under the preview-based inverse input) relative to the input energy. A simulation study on a piezoelectric actuator model is used to illustrate the proposed technique. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The presented procedure combines the selection of the fixed structure of the feedforward controller and the optimization of the controller parameters by iterative trials. A linear parametrization of the feedforward controller in a two-degree-of-freedom control architecture is chosen, which results in a feedforward controller that is applicable to a class of motion profiles as well as in a convex optimization problem, with the objective function being a quadratic function of the tracking error. Optimization by iterative trials avoids the need for detailed knowledge of the plant, achieves the controller parameter values that are optimal with respect to the actual plant, and allows for the adaptation to possible variations that occur in the plant dynamics. Experimental results on a high-precision wafer stage and a desktop printer illustrate the procedure.},

abstract = {Iterative Learning Control (ILC) is a control strategy to improve the performance of digital batch repetitive processes. Due to its digital implementation, discrete time ILC approaches do not guarantee good intersample behavior. In fact, common discrete time ILC approaches may deteriorate the intersample behavior, thereby reducing the performance of the sampled-data system. In this paper, a generally applicable multirate ILC approach is presented that enables to balance the at-sample performance and the intersample behavior. Furthermore, key theoretical issues regarding multirate systems are addressed, including the time-varying nature of the multirate ILC setup. The proposed multirate ILC approach is shown to outperform discrete time ILC in realistic simulation examples. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We propose a model that learns a shared covariance function on input-dependent features and a "free-form" covariance matrix over tasks. This allows for good flexibility when modelling inter-task dependencies while avoiding the need for large amounts of data for training. We show that under the assumption of noise-free observations and a block design, predictions for a given task only depend on its target values and therefore a cancellation of inter-task transfer occurs. We evaluate the benefits of our model on two practical applications: a compiler performance prediction problem and an exam score prediction task. Additionally, we make use of GP approximations and properties of our model in order to provide scalability to large data sets.},

Specifically, requirements on the plant are given so that convergence of the learning algorithm ensures monotonic convergence. In particular, for the case where one minus the learning gain times the first Markov parameter is positive, but less than one, it is shown that if the first non-zero Markov parameter of the system has a larger magnitude than the sum of the magnitudes of the next N-1 Markov parameters, then convergence of the learning control algorithm implies monotonic convergence, independent of the learning gain. For the ease where one minus the learning gain times the first Markov parameter is negative, but greater than negative one, a condition depending on the learning gain is derived whereby learning convergences also implies monotonic convergence.},

abstract = {This paper describes application of parameter-dependent control design methods to a turbofan engine, Parameter-dependent systems are linear systems, whose state-space descriptions are known functions of time-varying parameters. The time variation of each of the parameters is not known in advance, but is assumed to be measurable in real-time. Three linear, parameter-varying (LPV) approaches to control design are discussed. The first method is based on linear fractional transformations which relies on the small gain theorem for bounds on performance and robustness. The other methods make use of either a single (SQLF)or parameter-dependent (PDQLF) quadratic Lyapunov function to bound the achievable level of performance. The latter two techniques are used to synthesize controllers for a high-performance turbofan engine. A LPV model of the turbofan engine is constructed from Jacobian linearizations at fixed power codes for control design. The control problem is formulated as a model matching problem in the ℋ∞ and LPV framework. The objective is decoupled command response of the closed-loop system to pressure and rotor speed requests. The performance of linear, ℋ∞ point designs are compared with the SQLF and PDQLF controllers. Nonlinear simulations indicate that the controller synthesized using the SQLF approach is slightly more conservative than the PDQLF controller. Nonlinear simulations with the SQLF and PDQLF controllers show very robust designs that achieve all desired performance objectives. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Printing directly from a digital file on a medium is called digital printing. With the increasing interest in digitally printing personalized jobs on any medium, flexibility of printers becomes an equally important specification as printing quality and productivity. Oc{\'{e}} Technologies B.V. is a company with their own R&D department in printers. One oftheir products is the Arizona flatbed printer, the system which is used for the validation in this thesis. The objective ofthis research is to introduce flexible ILC for a multivariable system and thereby increasing the performance with respect to motion without losing or preferably increasing positioning accuracy. For complex multivariable systems, classical feedback and static parameterized feedforward are not appro- priate to obtain high performance. Extensive system knowledge is required to design proper feedforward signals and changes in the system cannot be taken into account. With ILC, extensive system knowledge is not necessary. Although significant performance improvements can be achieved using regular ILC, the drawback is the inflexibility regarding reference changes. The reference changes are apparent in printing and lead to impermissible performance degradation, hence another ILC method is introduced: ILC with basis functions for MIMO systems. In general feedforward signal parameterized in the reference with static parameters is used. The pro- posed method in this Master thesis is the use ofnorm optimal iterative learning control (ILC) with basis functions. By choosing reference dependent basis functions, this ILC method has the benefits of ILC regarding performance and the flexibility ofparameterized feedforward design. Norm optimal ILC with basis functions leads to significant improvements regarding the error, extrapola- tive properties and slow effects on the system. Considering a static model based feedforward with high speed motion, an average motion error ofapproximately 5.4 µm is achieved. This error increases with mo- tor heating. Ifone reference path is used for ten trials, ILC with basis functions leads to an approximate average motion error of3.8 µm. Ten trials for regular norm optimal ILC leads to an approximate average motion error of1.3 µm. Both ILC methods adept to slowly changing system behavior, hence the accuracy is not influenced by motor heating. Changing the reference profile leads to error degradation for regular norm optimal ILC, while it does not for norm optimal ILC with basis functions and static parameterized feedforward design. ILC with basis functions leads to performance improvement ofapproximately factor two compared to a static feedforward. Iterative learning control with basis functions is a method to design flexible and accurate feedforward control for complex, somewhat nonlinear multivariable systems. The use of system knowledge to deter- mine the basis functions is not sufficient to approximate the optimal feedforward signal. Further research into data driven methods could be ofuse to obtain new relevant basis functions.},

abstract = {Over the last two decades, scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) has become a very popular and widespread technique, with the number of publications and presentations making use of STEM techniques increasing by about an order of magnitude. Although the strengths of the technique for providing high-resolution structural and analytical information have been known and understood for much longer than that, the key to its more recent popularity has undoubtedly been the availability of STEM modes on instruments available from the major TEM manufacturers. Gone are the days when researchers want- ing the unique capabilities of high-resolution STEM had to undertake the task of keeping a VG dedicated STEM instrument operating. Given the current interest in the technique, we felt that the time was right to review the current state of knowledge about STEM and STEM-related techniques and their application to a range of materials problems. The purpose of this volume is both to educate those who wish to deepen their understanding of STEM and to inform those who are seeking a review of the latest applications and methods associated with STEM. We are delighted that so many of our colleagues accepted our invitation to contribute to this volume, and we are indebted to them for their efforts in creating such excellent contributions. The follow- ing chapters illustrate how close STEM has brought us to the ultimate materials characterisation challenge of analysing materials atom by atom. We hope that the following chapters demonstrate the spectacular results that can be achieved when performing the relatively simple experiment of focusing a beam of electrons down to an atomic scale and measuring the scattering that results.

abstract = {With the success of feedforward techniques for active noise control, feedback control researchers have begun to explore the relationship between these two control paradigms. The goal of this paper is to further investigate this relationship by means of the classical Bode integral constraint on achievable performance. This constraint provides insight into the phenomenon of spillover which we define as disturbance amplification by the closed-loop system relative to the open-loop transfer function gain. Specifically, it is shown that a particular feedforward controller called the zero spillover controller avoids spillover by producing perfect disturbance cancellation at every frequency. The analysis suggests that spillover can be avoided only if the control speaker and the disturbance source are noncolocated and the performance microphone and the measurement microphone are noncolocated. For realizability, we derive the approximate zero spillover controller which is shown to be an optimal feedback controller for an LQG problem with suitable cross weighting. Finally, the results are illustrated by means of structural and acoustic examples. {\textcopyright} 1998 IEEE.},

An increase in such requirements necessitates enhanced control performance. The aim of this paper is to identify several challenges for advanced motion control originating from these increasing accuracy, speed, and cost requirements. For instance, flexible mechanics must be explicitly addressed through overactuation, oversensing, inferential control, and position-dependent control. This in turn requires suitable models of appropriate complexity. One of the main advantages of such motion systems is the fact that experimenting and collecting large amounts of accurate data is inexpensive, paving the way for identifying and learning of models and controllers from experimental data. Several ongoing developments are outlined that constitute part of an overall framework for control, identification, and learning of complex motion systems. In turn, this may pave the way for new mechatronic design principles, leading to fast lightweight machines where spatio-temporal flexible mechanics are explicitly compensated through advanced motion control.},

abstract = {The carriage, with printheads jetting ink onto the medium, performs a point-to-point motion from left-to-right and vice versa, which is called a pass. Between two successive passes, the gantry beam performs a point-to-point motion in longitudinal direction, which is called a step. By repeating this step along the complete length ofthe surface, the entire printing surface is covered. The productivity ofthe Arizona flatbed printer is related to the time required to perform the point-to- point motions ofboth the gantry and the carriage. To improve the productivity ofthe printing system more aggressive motion profiles are introduced. The focus ofthis work is on the point-to-point motion ofthe gantry beam. To achieve high tracking performance feed forward control is of crucial importance. It is common practice to manually tune feed forward controllers. However, this is a time-consuming process. There- fore, an auto-tuning feed forward control strategy is desired. To this end, iterative learning control (ILC) with basis functions is considerd. Both a SISO ILC controller as well as a MIMO ILC controller are designed. The accuracy require- ments consists of± 5 µm error bounds around the end position ofthe left and right end ofthe gantry beam. The experimental results show that the designed MIMO ILC controller satisfies the accuracy requirements, in contrast to the SISO ILC controller which only achieves satisfactory performance at the center ofthe gantry beam. Since the Arizona printing system has different printing modes, extrapolation properties are essential to guarantee satisfactory performance. Therefore, a set ofreferences is considered consisting ofthree different motion profiles. Experimental results show that the designed MIMO ILC controller with basis functions achieves good tracking performance for the entire set ofmotion profiles},

abstract = {Accurate parametric identification of Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) systems requires an optimal prior selection of a set of functional dependencies for the parametrization of the model coefficients. Inaccurate selection leads to structural bias while over-parametrization results in a variance increase of the estimates. This corresponds to the classical bias-variance trade-off, but with a significantly larger degree of freedom and sensitivity in the LPV case. Hence, it is attractive to estimate the underlying model structure of LPV systems based on measured data, i.e., to learn the underlying dependencies of the model coefficients together with model orders etc. In this paper a Least-Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) approach is introduced which is capable of reconstructing the dependency structure for linear regression based LPV models even in case of rational dynamic dependency. The properties of the approach are analyzed in the prediction error setting and its performance is evaluated on representative examples. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

To increase both the production speed and paper size, the compensation of paper deformation is essential. A potential approach to compensate the paper deformation is actively changing the longitudinal paper position during a lateral pass of the printheads. This paper aims at developing an Iterative Learning Control (ILC) algorithm suited for this compensation strategy. The paper position is measured directly, but in non-real-time using image data obtained with a scanner located at the printheads. The proposed controller is experimentally validated and compared with standard norm-optimal ILC in a reproducible experiment, where a set of benchmark trajectories is used that represents severe paper deformation. The results show that in contrast to standard ILC, the ILC with basis functions achieves good tracking performance for the reference set and is hence a proper candidate algorithm for the compensation strategy.},

Systems controlled in a closed loop along a periodic trajectory can also be modelled as systems experiencing limit cycle behavior. The goal of this work is to identify from data, the local dynamics around the limit cycle using linear periodically parameter-varying models. Using a coordinate transformation onto transversal surfaces, the dynamics are decomposed into two parts: one along the limit cycle, and one on the transversal surfaces. Then, the model is identified from trajectory data using kernel-based methods with a periodic kernel design. The kernel-based model is extended to also account for variations in system parameters associated with different operating conditions. The performance of the proposed identification method is demonstrated on a benchmark nonlinear system and on a simplified airborne wind energy model. The method provides accurate model parameter estimation, compared to the analytical linearization, and good prediction capability.},

This paper presents a methodology to build a model able to capture the configuration-dependent dynamics and its embedded control system using co-simulation. Since such a model is available, a concurrent design, considering structural and control parameters, can be performed. This methodology is applied to a pick-and-place assembly robot.

We formulate a classical regularization approach, focused on finite impulse response (FIR) models, and find that regularization is necessary to cope with the high variance problem. This basic, regularized least squares approach is then a focal point for interpreting other techniques, like Bayesian inference and Gaussian process regression. The main issue is how to determine a suitable regularization matrix (Bayesian prior or kernel). Several regularization matrices are provided and numerically evaluated on a data bank of test systems and data sets. Our findings based on the data bank are as follows. The classical regularization approach with carefully chosen regularization matrices shows slightly better accuracy and clearly better robustness in estimating the impulse response than the standard approach-the prediction error method/maximum likelihood (PEM/ML) approach. If the goal is to estimate a model of given order as well as possible, a low order model is often better estimated by the PEM/ML approach, and a higher order model is often better estimated by model reduction on a high order regularized FIR model estimated with careful regularization. Moreover, an optimal regularization matrix that minimizes the mean square error matrix is derived and studied. The importance of this result lies in that it gives the theoretical upper bound on the accuracy that can be achieved for this classical regularization approach. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

A nonlinear diffeomorphism is introduced to explore the system structure and a simple filter is presented to ‘transform' the sensor fault into a pseudo-actuator fault scenario. A sliding mode observer is designed to reconstruct the sensor fault precisely if the system does not experience any uncertainty, and to estimate the sensor fault when uncertainty exists. The reconstruction and estimation signals are based only on available information and thus can be implemented online. Finally, a mass–spring system is used to illustrate the approach.},

abstract = {Motion systems with multiple control loops often run at a single sampling rate for simplicity of implementation and controller design. The achievable performance in terms of position accuracy is determined by the data acquisition hardware, such as sensors, actuators, and analog-to-digital/digital-to-analog converters, which is typically limited due to economic cost considerations. The aim of this paper is to develop a multirate approach to go beyond this traditional performance/cost tradeoff, i.e., to use different sampling rates in different control loops to optimally use hardware resources. The approach appropriately deals with the inherent time-varying behavior that is introduced by multirate sampling. A multirate feedforward control design framework is presented to optimize the tracking of a dual-stage multirate system. The application of the proposed approach to an industrial dual-stage wafer system demonstrates the advantages of multirate control, both in simulations and experiments.},

In this article, we present some results on iterative learning control. A complete review of the literature is given first. Then, a general formulation of the problem is given. Next, we present a complete analysis of the learning control problem for the case of linear, time‐invariant plants and controllers. This analysis offers: (1) insight into the nature of the solution of the learning control problem by deriving sufficient convergence conditions; (2) an approach to learning control for linear systems based on parameter estimation; and (3) an analysis that shows that for finite‐horizon problems it is possible to design a learning control algorithm that converges, with memory, in one step. Finally, a time‐varying learning controller is given for controlling the trajectory of a nonlinear robot manipulator. A brief simulation example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of this scheme. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1992 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., A Wiley Company},

This method overcomes the issues related to the computation of frequency response of LTP systems by utilizing the frequency response of the time-lifted system with linear time-invariant structure instead. The response is estimated with an ensemble of input-output data with periodic inputs. This allows the frequency-domain subspace identification technique to be extended to LTP systems. The time-aliased periodic impulse response can then be estimated and the order-revealing decomposition of the block-Hankel matrix is formulated. The consistency of the proposed method is proved under mild noise assumptions. Numerical simulation shows that the proposed method performs better than multiple widely-used time-domain subspace identification methods when an ensemble of periodic data is available.},

abstract = {Iterative learning control (ILC) enables high performance for systems that execute repeating tasks. Norm-optimal ILC based on lifted system representations provides an analytic expression for the optimal feedforward signal. However, for large tasks the computational load increases rapidly for increasing task lengths, compared to the low computational load associated with so-called frequency domain ILC designs. The aim of this paper is to solve norm-optimal ILC through a Riccati-based approach for a general performance criterion. The approach leads to exactly the same solution as found through lifted ILC, but at a much smaller computational load (O(N) vs O(N3)) for both linear time-invariant (LTI) and linear time-varying (LTV) systems. Interestingly, the approach involves solving a two-point boundary value problem (TPBVP). This is shown to have close connections to stable inversion techniques, which are central in typical frequency domain ILC designs. The proposed approach is implemented on an industrial flatbed printer with large tasks which cannot be implemented using traditional lifted ILC solutions. The proposed methodologies and results are applicable to both ILC and rational feedforward techniques by applying them to suitable closed-loop or open-loop system representations. In addition, they are applied to a position-dependent system, revealing necessity of addressing position-dependent dynamics and confirming the potential of LTV approaches in this situation.},

abstract = {Performance requirements in precision motion systems, including those used in integrated circuit manufacturing and printing systems, are ever increasing. For instance, internal deformations cannot be neglected anymore. As a result, measured signals at sensor locations cannot be used directly to evaluate performance at the point of interest. The aim of this brief is to develop an inferential motion control framework that explicitly distinguishes between performance variables and measured variables. In the proposed framework, a dynamic model is used to infer the performance variables from the measured variables. As the inferred performance variables depend on the model quality, an identification for robust inferential control approach is pursued that tightly captures the uncertainty. Experimental results on a prototype motion system reveal that ignoring internal deformations using traditional motion control design approaches can lead to disastrous performance at the point of interest. In addition, it is shown that the proposed inferential motion control framework leads to high performance at the unmeasurable point of interest.},

The rigid-body design paradigm aims at very stiff designs, which lead in an evolutionary way to increasingly heavier systems. Such systems require more and more power, such that this paradigm rapidly approaches the boundary of its scalability. An alternative paradigm is to design a lightweight machine with over-actuation and over-sensing, to deal with the resulting flexibilities. This paper presents a spatial feedforward method for over-actuated flexible motions systems, which aims at reducing the vibrations over the complete flexible structure during motion. The proposed method is experimentally validated on an industrial prototype and compared to mass feedforward and the standard input shaping technique.

The dual-rate equivalent model of controllers, filters, estimators, etc. are encountered in the indirect design of digital controllers. From a dual-rate point-of-view, two different situations can arise: a) the output is sampled every NT instants and the input is updated at T (N-times faster); b) the input is updated at NT and the output is sampled at T (N-times faster). The effectiveness of the dual-rate sampling can be studied a priori at single-rate low frequency (constrained frequency) by analyzing its effects on the system when the ratio between frequencies goes to infinity.},

We formalize this task as a multi-armed bandit problem, where the payoff function is either sampled from a Gaussian process (GP) or has low RKHS norm. We resolve the important open problem of deriving regret bounds for this setting, which imply novel convergence rates for GP optimization. We analyze GP-UCB, an intuitive upper-confidence based algorithm, and bound its cumulative regret in terms of maximal information gain, establishing a novel connection between GP optimization and experimental design. Moreover, by bounding the latter in terms of operator spectra, we obtain explicit sublinear regret bounds for many commonly used covariance functions. In some important cases, our bounds have surprisingly weak dependence on the dimensionality. In our experiments on real sensor data, GP-UCB compares favorably with other heuristical GP optimization approaches. Copyright 2010 by the author(s)/owner(s).},

abstract = {Recently [1] a method has been developed to suppress nonparametrically the noise (and system) transients (leakage errors) in frequency response function and noise (co-)variance estimates of single-input, single-output systems excited by periodic signals. This paper extends the results of [1] to multiple-input, multiple-output systems where all inputs and outputs are disturbed by noise (i.e. an errors-in-variables framework). Two methods are presented: the first starts from multiple experiments with uncorrelated sets of inputs, and makes no assumption about the frequency response matrix (FRM); while the second only requires one single experiment, but assumes that the FRM can locally be approximated by a polynomial. Both methods estimate simultaneously the FRM, the noise level, and the level of the nonlinear distortions. For lightly damped systems, the proposed methods either significantly reduce the experiment duration or, for a given measurement time, significantly increase the frequency resolution of the FRM estimate. If the noise (and/or system) transients are the dominant error sources, then the proposed methods also significantly reduce the covariance matrix of the FRM estimates. The use of the nonparametric noise covariance estimates for parametric transfer function modelling is also discussed in detail. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The system learns by repeated trials, each starting from the same initial conditions. Data from multiple trials are used to identify a model of the system during the finite time interval of interest. A learning controller is then designed from the identified model. If the identification is perfect, the necessary control can be computed directly from the identified model, and there is no need for learning. If the identification is not perfect, the remaining error can be corrected by learning control. By the use of input basis functions, this formulation shows that one need to perform the identification only in a portion of the system dynamics relevant to the specific trajectory to be tracked for successful learning.},

The applicability of the proposed approach is then investigated for the modeling of complex nonlinear process systems. In this approach, the dependence structure of the model on the scheduling variables is identified based on a Gaussian process (GP) formulation. The GP is used as a prior distribution to describe the possible realization of the scheduling-dependent coefficient functions of the estimated model. Then, a posterior distribution of these functions is obtained given the measured data and the mean value of this distribution is used to determine the estimated model.

The quality that is required for a high tracking performance is generally not achieved when the controller parameters are determined on the basis of a detailed model of the plant dynamics or manual tuning. This chapter shows that the optimization of the controller parameters by iterative trials, i.e., data-driven, in both parametric and non-parametric feedforward control structures avoids the need for a detailed model of the plant dynamics, achieves optimal controller parameter values, and allows for the adaptation to possible variations in the plant dynamics. Two industrial applications highlight the large benefits of the data-driven optimization approach. The optimization of the feedforward controller parameters in a wafer scanner application leads to extremely short settling times and higher productivity. The optimization of the current amplifier setpoints in a digital light projection (DLP) application leads to nearly constant color rendering performances of the projection system in spite of large changes in the lamp dynamics over its life span. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

The aim of this paper is to develop an FRF modeling framework for periodically scheduled Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) LPV systems, that enables the identification of LPV FRF models from global experiments. This is achieved by developing an appropriate definition of the harmonic FRF for input–output LPV systems and by developing a method to compute a suitable harmonic FRF estimator. The developed approach generalizes the Empirical Transfer Function Estimate (ETFE) to the class of periodically-scheduled LPV systems, and the classical ETFE is recovered for LTI systems as a special case. The developed method is successfully used to estimate a SISO LPV FRF of an experimental motion system, thereby confirming the potential of the developed framework.},

The purpose of this paper is the development of a control design framework that enables the usage of models delivered by system identification techniques, while explicitly addressing both the digital controller implementation and the intersample behaviour aspects. Thereto, the incompatibility of the models delivered by system identification techniques and the models used in sampled-data control is analysed. To use models delivered by system identification techniques in conjunction with optimal sampled-data control, tools are employed that stem from multirate system theory. For the actual control design, key theoretical issues in sampled-data control, which include the linear periodically time-varying nature of sampled-data systems, are addressed. The control design approach is applied to the (Formula presented.) -optimal feedback control design of an industrial high-performance wafer scanner. Experimental results illustrate the necessity of addressing the intersample behaviour in high-performance control design. {\textcopyright} 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the dynamic modeling and adaptive control of a H-type gantry stage. The stage is posed as a three-degree-of-freedom system. Based on this structure, a mathematical model is built using the Lagrangian equation. An adaptive control method is formulated for the positioning of the stage, with minimal a priori information assumed of the model. A stability analysis is provided for the proposed control scheme. Both software simulation and experimental results are documented to illustrate the practical application of the scheme, and to verify the adequateness of the gantry model. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Jones1998,
abstract = {In many engineering optimization problems, the number of function evaluations is severely limited by time or cost. These problems pose a special challenge to the field of global optimization, since existing methods often require more function evaluations than can be comfortably afforded. One way to address this challenge is to fit response surfaces to data collected by evaluating the objective and constraint functions at a few points. These surfaces can then be used for visualization, tradeoff analysis, and optimization. In this paper, we introduce the reader to a response surface methodology that is especially good at modeling the nonlinear, multimodal functions that often occur in engineering. We then show how these approximating functions can be used to construct an efficient global optimization algorithm with a credible stopping rule. The key to using response surfaces for global optimization lies in balancing the need to exploit the approximating surface (by sampling where it is minimized) with the need to improve the approximation (by sampling where prediction error may be high). Striking this balance requires solving certain auxiliary problems which have previously been considered intractable, but we show how these computational obstacles can be overcome.},

Part I (Pintelon et al.

The contributions of Part II are the following. First, it is shown that the proposed method can be used for nonlinear systems and for parametric identification of the system dynamics in a generalized output error framework. Next, the methodology is generalized to handle noisy input-output data (= errors-in-variables problem), and identification in feedback. Finally, the approach is illustrated on simulations and real measurements examples. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A nonlinear filter design is proposed to improve nanopositioning servo performances in high-speed (and generally linear) motion systems. The design offers a means to adapt fundamental control design tradeoffs-like disturbance suppression versus noise sensitivity-which are otherwise fixed. Typically performance-limiting oscillations in the feedback system that benefit from extra control are temporarily upscaled and subjected to nonlinear weighting. For sufficiently large amplitudes, this nonlinear filter operation induces extra controller gain. Oscillations that do not benefit from this extra control (typically because they represent noise contributions that should not be amplified) remain unscaled and, as such, do not induce extra controller gain. The combined usage of linear weighting filters with their exact inverses renders this part of the nonlinear filter design strictly performance based. The effective means to improve servo performance is demonstrated on a short-stroke wafer stage of an industrial wafer scanner. Since the nonlinear filter design is largely based on Lyapunov arguments, stability is guaranteed along the different design steps. {\textcopyright} 2009 IEEE.},

Basis functions are introduced in ILC that incorporate linear combinations of different functions of state variables. By iteratively learning coefficients of these functions, ILC is capable of achieving high performance despite variations in the motion tasks. In this paper, an effective and generally applicable practical approach for selecting the basis functions using available models is presented. The approach is experimentally validated on a motion stage of a commercial wirebonder that features coupled and non-linear dynamics. By combining the conventional basis functions with ones that are based on the rigid-body equations of motion of the stage, a set of the basis functions is obtained which achieves significant reduction of the measured tracking errors. Practical guidelines for selection of the compact set of the basis functions is given together with results of experimental validation.},

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
In this paper, a method is developed to directly identify feedforward controllers for LPV motions systems, including dynamic dependence on the scheduling sequence. A polynomial feedforward model is developed for LPV motion systems by using a change of variables, i.e., the double integral of the input signal. The feedforward parameters are directly identified with input-output data using a kernel-regularized approach. An example shows that tracking performance is significantly improved compared to existing LTI or LPV approaches that do not take dynamic dependence into account. \\
Ongoing research is aimed at adding instrumental variables and directly learning LPV feedforward parameters without change of variables. Finally, experimental validation of the framework is part of ongoing work.

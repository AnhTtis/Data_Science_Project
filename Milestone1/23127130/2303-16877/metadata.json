    "abstract": "We develop a mathematically simple yet accurate model for the single-pulse non-resonant impulsive alignment of thermal ensembles of linear molecules. We find that our molecular alignment model, which is based on the 2D rotor, not only provides a simplification for analytical and numerical calculations, but also establishes intuitive connections between system parameters, such as temperature and pulse intensity, and the resulting shape of the temporal molecular alignment.",

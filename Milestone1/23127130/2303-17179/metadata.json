    "abstract": "Debris discs around main sequence stars have been extensively characterised from infrared to millimetre wavelengths through imaging, spectroscopic, and total intensity (scattered light and/or thermal emission) measurements. Polarimetric observations have only been used sparingly to interpret the composition, structure, and size of dust grains in these discs. Here we present new multi-wavelength aperture polarisation observations with parts-per-million sensitivity of a sample of twelve bright debris discs, spanning a broad range of host star spectral types, and disc properties. These measurements were mostly taken with the HIgh Precision Polarimetric Instrument on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. We combine these polarisation observations with the known disc architectures and geometries of the discs to interpret the measurements. We detect significant polarisation attributable to circumstellar dust from HD 377 and HD 39060, and find tentative evidence for HD 188228 and HD 202628.",

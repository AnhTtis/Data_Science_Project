    "abstract": "We consider the setting of manifolds with ends which are obtained by compact perturbation (gluing) of ends of the form $\\mathbb{R}^{n_i}\\times \\mathcal{M}_i$. We investigate family of vertical resolvent $\\{\\sqrt{t}\\nabla(1+tΔ)^{-m}\\}_{t>0}$ where $m\\geq1$. We show that the family is uniformly continuous on all $L^p$ for $1\\le p \\le \\min_{i}n_i$. Interestingly this is a closed-end condition in the considered setting. We prove that the corresponding Maximal function is bounded in the same range except that it is only weak-type $(1,1)$ for $p=1$. The Fefferman-Stein vector-valued maximal function is again of weak-type $(1,1)$ but bounded if and only if $1<p<\\min_{i}n_i$, and not at $p=\\min_{i}n_i$.",

  abstract = {An intrinsically nonmagnetic spectroscopy is shown to have strong magnetic sensitivity in Kondo-coupled PdCrO2. A nearly free electron metal and a Mott insulating state can be thought of as opposite ends of the spectrum of possibilities for the motion of electrons in a solid. Understanding their interaction lies at the heart of the correlated electron problem. In the magnetic oxide metal PdCrO2, nearly free and Mott-localized electrons exist in alternating layers, forming natural heterostructures. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, quantitatively supported by a strong coupling analysis, we show that the coupling between these layers leads to an “intertwined” excitation that is a convolution of the charge spectrum of the metallic layer and the spin susceptibility of the Mott layer. Our findings establish PdCrO2 as a model system in which to probe Kondo lattice physics and also open new routes to use the a priori nonmagnetic probe of photoemission to gain insights into the spin susceptibility of correlated electron materials.},

In particular, we study the time evolution of correlations and entanglement following a quench. The investigated quantities show a light-cone-like evolution, i.e. the spreading with a finite velocity. We discuss the relation of this velocity to other characteristic velocities of the system, like the sound velocity. The entanglement is investigated using two different measures, the von Neumann entropy and mutual information. Whereas the von Neumann entropy grows rapidly with time the mutual information between two small subsystems can decrease as well after an initial increase. Additionally we show that the static von Neumann entropy characterizes the location of the quantum phase transition.},

\begin{abstract}

Intelligent vehicles (IVs) have attracted wide attention thanks to the augmented convenience, safety advantages, and potential commercial value. Although a few of autonomous driving unicorns assert that IVs will be commercially deployable by 2025, their deployment is still restricted to small-scale validation due to various issues, among which safety, reliability, and generalization of planning methods are prominent concerns. Precise computation of control commands or trajectories by planning methods remains a prerequisite for IVs, owing to perceptual imperfections under complex environments, which pose an obstacle to the successful commercialization of IVs. This paper aims to review state-of-the-art planning methods, including pipeline planning and end-to-end planning methods. In terms of pipeline methods, a survey of selecting algorithms is provided along with a discussion of the expansion and optimization mechanisms, whereas in end-to-end methods, the training approaches and verification scenarios of driving tasks are points of concern. Experimental platforms are reviewed to facilitate readers in selecting suitable training and validation methods. Finally, the current challenges and future directions are discussed. The side-by-side comparison presented in this survey helps to gain insights into the strengths and limitations of the reviewed methods, which also assists with system-level design choices.

\IEEEPARstart{A}{utonomous} driving has gained considerable attention from government, industry, academia, and the general public due to its potential to revolutionize transportation, facilitated by advances in artificial intelligence and computer hardware \cite{Surveyofsurvey}. The deployment of intelligent vehicles (IVs) in the environmental landscape has the great potential to reduce road accidents and traffic congestion so as to improve our mobility in overcrowded megacities \cite{wenshuowang}. Although phenomenal contributions from plenty of the leading names in the industry, government, and research, IVs are still out of reach except in limited trial programs due to key concerns about their reliability and safety. Apart from technical challenges, adverse weather conditions, such as rain, fog, and snow, also present significant obstacles to the safety, robustness, and generalization of planning methods.

%Planning methods are an essential component of the autonomous driving framework, however, various scenarios and adverse weather conditions such as rain, fog, and snow pose substantial challenges for safe and reliable driverless technology 
In order to achieve a higher level of awareness of the surrounding scenarios, and increased safety, efficiency, and capabilities, IVs are always equipped with different types of sensors. Despite multifarious sensors, IVs are constrained by the ability to inadequately detecting in adverse scenarios. Thus ensuring the safety, robustness, and generalization of planning methods is a pivotal problem for the implementation of autonomous driving.

% Along with multiple sensors, artificial intelligence algorithms, simulation platforms, large datasets, and public policies play major roles in the development of autonomous driving with higher levels of intelligence and mobility. 


% Artificial algorithms efficiently process the vast amount of multisensory data to train and validate the family of machine learning models that underpin autonomous driving systems. 


% These systems make sense of the scenarios and the objects in the environment and dictate the paths that the vehicles ultimately take. 

% This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the general planning method for autonomous driving. Broadly speaking, the planning methods for autonomous driving can be categorized into two distinct classifications, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:Total}: pipeline and end-to-end \cite{surveye2e}. 
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the general planning method for autonomous driving. Generally speaking, the planning methods for autonomous driving can be classified into two categories, i.e., pipeline and end-to-end.


%\textbf{The pipeline planning method is commonly coupled with perception, location, and control to form the pipeline framework for autonomous driving. The pipeline framework enables developing teams to concentrate on well-defined sub-tasks and independently make improvements across the whole stack, keeping the system operational as long as the intermediate outputs are kept functional.}


The pipeline planning method, also known as the rule-based planning approach, is a well-established method and extensively adopted by the industry. As shown in Fig. \ref{1a_123}, this method is a subset of the pipeline framework and needs to be coupled with other methods to accomplish autonomous driving tasks, such as perception, localization, and control \cite{Cao1}. As a major advantage, the pipeline framework is interpretable. The defective module can be identified when a malfunction or unexpected system behavior occurs, which makes this framework highly preferred in industry. To limit the scope of Section-\ref{ppl}, we only concentrate on aspects of the planning method within the pipeline framework. The pipeline planning method consists of two primary components: a road-level path from the origin to the destination via global route planning, and a short-term trajectory via local behavior and (or) trajectory planning. Although the pipeline planning method is widely used in industry, the restriction of the method is that it requires a large volume of computation resources and many manual heuristic functions \cite{planning_k}. In this study, we focus on the expansion and optimization mechanisms of the pipeline method.

The end-to-end planning method, also known as the learning-based approach, is a new kind of approach and becomes a tendency in autonomous vehicle research. In this method, the entire driving pipeline is referred to as a single machine-learning task from raw perception data to control commands. The driving model can learn knowledge via imitation learning, explore driving policy via reinforcement learning, or continuously self-optimize via parallel learning. In general, the architecture of the end-to-end method is simple with much fewer components. Despite its appealing concept, it is difficult or even impossible to find out the reasons when the model misbehaves. In this case, our study concentrates on the network structure, training technique, and deployment tasks of the end-to-end model.



In Section-\ref{ppl}, we begin with reviewing pipeline planning methods, including global route planning and local behavior/trajectory planning, where we especially discuss the expansion and optimization mechanisms. The reviewed end-to-end planning methods, including imitation learning, reinforcement learning, and parallel learning are listed in Section-\ref{e2e}. The network architect, generalizability and robustness, and validation \& verification methods are explored in detail. In addition, large datasets, simulation platforms, and physical platforms play auxiliary roles in the development of autonomous driving with higher levels of intelligence and mobility, so we summarize other contents of autonomous driving in Section-\ref{experiments}, including the dataset, simulation platforms, and physical platforms. Finally, we review the current challenges and future directions of autonomous driving in Section-\ref{future}.

% The results of the large-scale tests in physical platforms support our previous conclusion that autonomous driving still has a long way to go for large-scale commercial use.

The contributions of this survey are outlined as follows:

% This survey represents the first comprehensive review of all planning methods in IVs, encompassing both pipeline planning and end-to-end planning approaches.

% This survey provides a thorough analysis and summary of the latest datasets, simulation platforms, and semi-open real-world testing scenarios.

\section{End-to-End Planning Methods \label{e2e}}

End-to-end stands for the direct mapping from raw sensor data into trajectory points or control signals. Because of its ability to extract task-specific policies, it has been utilized with great success in a variety of fields \cite{TVT3}. Compared with the pipeline method, there is no external gap between the perception and control modules and seldom human-customized heuristics are embedded, so the end-to-end method deals with vehicle-environment interactions more efficiently \cite{zhu2021survey}. End-to-end has a higher ceiling, with the potential to achieve expert performance in the autonomous driving field. In this section, we divide the end-to-end method into three categories:  imitation learning, reinforcement learning, and parallel learning.

\section{Challenges and Future Directions \label{future}}
Considerable progress has been achieved in autonomous driving, as evidenced by its successful validation on semi-open roads in various cities. However, its complete commercial deployment is yet to be realized due to numerous obstacles and impending challenges that need to be surmounted.
\subsection{Challenges}

The challenges in IVs are summarised below:

    \textbf{Limitations of perception.} Most autonomous driving frameworks heavily rely on perception results, but most sensors are limited by their inherent constraints. Vision sensors are susceptible to the effects of field of view and weather, and are less effective in back-lighting as well as strong light exposure. Perception results often suffer from partial perception problems, and thus potential dangers that are obscured by obstacles may be ignored. These drawbacks pose security challenges for autonomous driving.

    \textbf{Limitations of planning.}  Both pipeline and end-to-end planning have intrinsic limitations, and ensuring the production of high-quality outputs under uncertain and complex scenarios is an indispensable research objective.

  \textbf{Limitations of safety.} Hacking incidents for autonomous driving systems are increasing, and even minor disruptions have the possibility to trigger significant deviations in decision-making. Therefore, the successful deployment of autonomous driving technology on a massive scale necessitates robust measures to counter adversarial attacks.
  

\textbf{Limitations of datasets.} Simulation datasets facilitate model training, and the well-trained model in simulation environments is often not directly transferable to reality. Therefore, bridging the gap between virtual and real data is an imperative research avenue.






\subsection{Future Directions}
Currently, planning methods are hard to handle all complex scenarios, and the models are also restricted by safety, generalization, and interpretability. Future research trends include:
\begin{itemize}

  \item [1)] 
    Confronting the constraints of perception. Many researchers try to incorporate cognition into the perception layer. By leveraging human cognitive abilities, it is plausible to overcome autonomous driving challenges.
  \item [2)]
    Tackling the problem of the uninterpretability of end-to-end methods. Many researchers enhance interpretability by generating interpretable intermediate representations in the latent layer. The exploration of employing these representations for end-to-end methods represents a research direction for IVs.

  \item [3)]

    Managing the problem of hacker attacks on IVs, present defenses are proven inadequate against SOTA attacks, and the development of robust defense techniques against such attacks carries important research implications.
  
  \item [4)]
    Facing challenges for decision-making in complex scenarios. Integrating human cognitive abilities into autonomous driving and a comprehensive understanding of scenario features is an effective way to overcome the present limitations.


    \item [5)]
    Giving the challenges posed by the robustness and generalizability of planning methods, the well-trained large model in ChatCPT \cite{Chat1} shows surpassing human-level capability in solving complex problems. This holds true in the domain of autonomous driving as well, where a promising future direction concerns rationalizing the application of large models.
    \item[6)]
    
    Confronting with the challenge of datasets migration from virtual to real, the description principle \cite{miao2023parallel} of parallel system theory may serve as an efficacious solution. By coupling the two types of data using the description principle, a feedback loop is generated, which enables circular self-optimization.

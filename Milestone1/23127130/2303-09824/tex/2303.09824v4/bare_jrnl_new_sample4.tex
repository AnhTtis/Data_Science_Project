% Thanks to the augmented convenience, safety advantages, and potential commercial value, Intelligent vehicles (IVs) have attracted wide attention throughout the world. Although a few autonomous driving unicorns assert that IVs will be commercially deployable by 2025, their implementation is still restricted to small-scale validation due to various issues, among which precise computation of control commands or trajectories by planning methods remains a prerequisite for IVs. This paper aims to review state-of-the-art planning methods, including pipeline planning and end-to-end planning methods. In terms of pipeline methods, a survey of selecting algorithms is provided along with a discussion of the expansion and optimization mechanisms, whereas in end-to-end methods, the training approaches and verification scenarios of driving tasks are points of concern. Experimental platforms are reviewed to facilitate readers in selecting suitable training and validation methods. Finally, the current challenges and future directions are discussed. The side-by-side comparison presented in this survey not only helps to gain insights into the strengths and limitations of the reviewed methods but also assists with system-level design choices.

\section{Introduction}



% \IEEEPARstart{I}{ntelligent} vehicles (IVs) have gained considerable attention from government, industry, academia, and the general public due to their potential to revolutionize transportation, facilitated by advances in artificial intelligence and computer hardware \cite{Surveyofsurvey}. The deployment of IVs in the environmental landscape has the great potential to reduce road accidents and traffic congestion so as to improve our mobility in overcrowded megacities \cite{wenshuowang}. Although phenomenal contributions achieved by plenty of the leading names in this area, IVs are still out of reach except in limited trial programs due to key concerns about their reliability and safety. In order to achieve a higher level of awareness of the surrounding environments, and increased safety, efficiency, and capabilities, IVs are always equipped with different types of sensors. Despite multifarious sensors, IVs are constrained by the ability to inadequately detecting in adverse scenarios. Thus ensuring the safety, robustness, and generalization of planning methods is a pivotal problem for the implementation of autonomous driving \cite{OS}.

\IEEEPARstart{I}{ntelligent} vehicles (IVs) have attracted significant interest from governments, industries, academia, and the public, owing to their potential to transform transportation through advances in artificial intelligence and computer hardware \cite{Surveyofsurvey}. The deployment of IVs holds great promise for reducing road accidents and alleviating traffic congestion, thereby improving mobility in densely populated urban areas \cite{wenshuowang}. Despite remarkable contributions by leading experts in the field, IVs remain primarily confined to limited trial programs due to concerns about their reliability and safety. To enhance situational awareness and improve safety, efficiency, and overall capabilities, IVs are equipped with a variety of sensors. However, even with an array of sensors, an IV stills face challenges in adequately detecting and responding to complex scenarios. Consequently, ensuring the safety, robustness, and adaptability of planning methods becomes crucial for the successful implementation of autonomous driving \cite{OS}.


%Apart from technical challenges, adverse weather environments, such as rain, fog, and snow, also present significant obstacles to the safety, robustness, and generalization of planning methods.

%Planning methods are an essential component of the autonomous driving framework, however, various scenarios and adverse weather conditions such as rain, fog, and snow pose substantial challenges for safe and reliable driverless technology

% Artificial algorithms efficiently process the vast amount of multisensory data to train and validate the family of machine learning models that underpin autonomous driving systems. 


% These systems make sense of the scenarios and the objects in the environment and dictate the paths that the vehicles ultimately take. 

% This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the general planning method for autonomous driving. Broadly speaking, the planning methods for autonomous driving can be categorized into two distinct classifications, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:Total}: pipeline and end-to-end \cite{surveye2e}. 

%The contributions of this survey are outlined as follows:

% \section{Background and comparison \label{background}}





%\textbf{The pipeline planning method is commonly coupled with perception, location, and control to form the pipeline framework for autonomous driving. The pipeline framework enables developing teams to concentrate on well-defined sub-tasks and independently make improvements across the whole stack, keeping the system operational as long as the intermediate outputs are kept functional.}

\subsection{Background}

The pipeline planning method, also known as the rule-based planning method, is a well-established category of planners. As depicted in \ref{1a_123}, this method serves as a core component of the pipeline framework and must be integrated with other methods, such as perception \cite{TIV___1},  localization, and control, to accomplish autonomous driving tasks. A significant advantage of the pipeline framework is its interpretability, enabling the identification of defective modules when malfunctions or unexpected system behavior occur. In Section-\ref{ppl}, the focus is solely on the planning method within the pipeline framework. The pipeline planning method comprises two primary components: global route planning, which generates a road-level path from the origin to the destination, and local behavior/trajectory planning, which generates a short-term trajectory. Although widely used in the industry, the pipeline planning method requires substantial computational resources and numerous manual heuristic functions \cite{planning_k}. This study specifically addresses the expansion and optimization mechanisms of the pipeline planning method.

The end-to-end planning method, also known as the learning-based approach, is the sole component in the end-to-end framework and has become a trend in autonomous vehicle research. As illustrated in \ref{1b_123}, the entire driving framework is treated as a single machine learning task that converts raw perception data into control commands. The driving model acquires knowledge through imitation learning, develops driving policies through reinforcement learning, and continuously self-optimizes via parallel learning. Despite its appealing concept, determining the reasons for model misbehavior can be challenging. Consequently, this study focuses on the network structure, training techniques, and deployment tasks of the end-to-end model.

\subsection{Comparison}


\textcolor{black}{In this subsection, we provide a concise overview of the distinctions between pipeline and end-to-end methods, particularly highlighting their respective advantages and disadvantages.}

\textcolor{black}{The pipeline framework, widely implemented in the industry, allows engineers to focus on well-defined sub-tasks and independently improve each sub-model within the entire pipeline. Due to its clear intermediate representations and deterministic decision-making rules, this framework facilitates pinpointing the root cause of errors when unexpected behavior occurs. Moreover, it enables reliable reasoning about how the system generates specific control signals. However, the pipeline framework has some drawbacks. Individual sub-models may not be optimal for all driving scenarios, posing a challenge to the generalization of the framework. Additionally, the concatenation of sub-modules and the numerous manual customization constraints in each sub-model can compromise the robustness and real-time capabilities of the method.}

\textcolor{black}{The end-to-end framework optimizes the entire driving task, from raw perception to control signals, as a single deep learning task. By learning optimal intermediate representations for the target task, the framework can attend to any implicit sources of raw data without human-defined information bottlenecks, enhancing its generalization for various scenarios. The end-to-end framework's streamlined architecture, consisting of one or a few networks, also offers superior robustness and real-time capabilities compared to the pipeline framework. However, as research progresses, the end-to-end optimization faces a critical interpretability issue. Without intermediate outputs, tracing the initial cause of an error and explaining why the model arrived at specific control commands or trajectories becomes more challenging.}




\subsection{Paper Structure}


\textcolor{black}{In Section \ref{ppl}, pipeline planning methods are reviewed, including global route planning and local behavior/trajectory planning, with a particular focus on the expansion and optimization mechanisms. In Section \ref{e2e}, end-to-end planning methods are examined, encompassing imitation learning, reinforcement learning, and parallel learning, while exploring network architecture, generalizability, robustness, and validation \& verification methods. Additionally, large datasets, simulation platforms, and physical platforms play auxiliary roles in the development of autonomous driving with higher levels of intelligence and mobility. Therefore, other aspects of autonomous driving are summarized in Section \ref{experiments}, including datasets, simulation platforms, and physical platforms. Finally in Section \ref{future}, current challenges and future directions of autonomous driving are reviewed.}

%In Section-\ref{ppl}, we begin with reviewing pipeline planning methods, including global route planning and local behavior/trajectory planning, where we especially discuss the expansion and optimization mechanisms. The reviewed end-to-end planning methods, including imitation learning, reinforcement learning, and parallel learning are listed in Section-\ref{e2e}. The network architect, generalizability and robustness, and validation \& verification methods are explored in detail. In addition, large datasets, simulation platforms, and physical platforms play auxiliary roles in the development of autonomous driving with higher levels of intelligence and mobility, thus, we summarize other contents of autonomous driving in Section-\ref{experiments}, including the dataset, simulation platforms, and physical platforms. Finally, we review the current challenges and future directions of autonomous driving in Section-\ref{future}.

\textcolor{black}{This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the general planning methods for autonomous driving. Broadly speaking, planning methods for autonomous driving can be classified into two categories: pipeline and end-to-end.} 

\textcolor{black}{There have been numerous state-of-the-art works on motion planning for IVs, however, a comprehensive review encompassing both pipeline and end-to-end methods has yet to be conducted. The pipeline is a classical planning method commonly used in the industry, with general categories outlined in previous research \cite{Li3, sur_pipeline2}. In this paper, we propose a new classification of pipeline methods that captures the extensively deployed approaches in a manner more relevant to industry selection, based on the expansion and optimization mechanisms of each method. Our proposed classification includes state grid identification, primitive generation, and other approaches. The end-to-end approach has emerged as a popular research direction in recent years, as demonstrated by previous work \cite{surveye2e, Review1}, which illustrates methods for mapping raw perception inputs to control command outputs. In this survey, we not only review the latest achievements in imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL) but also introduce a novel category called parallel planning. This category proposes a virtual-real interaction confusion learning method for a reliable end-to-end planning method. Furthermore, we provide a thorough analysis and summary of the latest datasets, simulation platforms, and semi-open real-world testing scenarios, which serve as essential auxiliary elements for the advancement of IVs. To the best of our knowledge, this survey presents the first comprehensive analysis of motion planning methods in various scenarios and tasks.}

\section{End-to-End Planning Methods \label{e2e}}


\textcolor{black}{End-to-end stands for the direct mapping from raw sensor data into trajectory points or control signals. Because of its ability to extract task-specific policies, it has achieved great success in a variety of fields \cite{Review1}.} Compared with the pipeline method, there is no external gap between the perception and control modules, and seldom human-customized heuristics are embedded, so the end-to-end method deals with vehicle-environment interactions more efficiently. End-to-end has a higher ceiling, with the potential to achieve expert performance in the autonomous driving field. \textcolor{black}{This section categorizes the end-to-end method into three distinct types from learning methods: imitation learning using supervised learning, reinforcement learning utilizing unsupervised learning, and parallel learning incorporating confusion learning. Fig. \ref{fig:Mindmap} further clarification of the structural relationships fo end-to-end planner, highlighting the performance and progressiveness of the reviewed methods.}

\section{Challenges and Future Perspectives \label{future}}
Considerable milestones have been achieved in autonomous driving, as evidenced by its successful validation on semi-open roads in various cities. However, its complete commercial deployment is yet to be realized due to numerous obstacles and impending challenges that need to be surmounted.
\subsection{Challenges}

The challenges in IVs are summarised below:
\begin{itemize}
     \item [1)] \textcolor{black}{Perception: autonomous driving frameworks heavily rely on perception data, however, most sensors are vulnerable to environmental effects and suffer from partial perception issues. As a result, potential hazards may be ignored, and these drawbacks present security challenges for autonomous driving.}
     \item [2)] \textcolor{black}{Planning: both pipeline and end-to-end planning have intrinsic limitations, and ensuring the production of high-quality outputs under uncertain and complex scenarios is an indispensable research objective.}
     \item [3)] \textcolor{black}{Safety: hacking for autonomous driving systems is increasing, even minor disruptions have possibly triggered significant deviations. Therefore, the deployment of autonomous driving methods on a massive scale necessitates robust measures to counter adversarial attacks.}
     \item[4)] \textcolor{black}{Dataset: simulators are essential for training and testing autonomous driving models, however, models well-trained in virtual environments often cannot be directly implemented in reality \cite{Proceeding}. Thus, bridging the gap between virtual and real data is imperative for advancing research in this field.}
\end{itemize}

%     \textbf{Limitations of planning.}  Both pipeline and end-to-end planning have intrinsic limitations, and ensuring the production of high-quality outputs under uncertain and complex scenarios is an indispensable research objective.

%   \textbf{Limitations of safety.} Hacking incidents for autonomous driving systems are increasing, and even minor disruptions have the possibility to trigger significant deviations in decision-making. Therefore, the successful deployment of autonomous driving methods on a massive scale necessitates robust measures to counter adversarial attacks.

% \textbf{Limitations of datasets.} Simulators are essential for training and testing autonomous driving models, however, models well-trained in virtual environments often cannot be directly implemented in reality \cite{Proceeding}. Thus, bridging the gap between virtual and real data is imperative for advancing research in this field.






\subsection{Future Perspectives}
% Currently, IVs are hard to cover all complex scenarios, and the models are also restricted by safety, fairness, and interpretability. Future research trends include:

The mechanism of the end-to-end planner is the closest to the human driver, according to the input state to calculate the output space. However, due to challenges in data, interpretability, generalization, and policies, end-to-end planners are still scarcely implemented in the real world. Herein, we propose some future perspectives in the field of end-to-end planning.


\begin{itemize}

  \item [$\bullet$] 
    %Confronting the constraints of perception. Many researchers try to incorporate cognition into the perception layer. By leveraging human cognitive abilities, it is plausible to overcome autonomous driving challenges.
    \textcolor{black}{Interpretability: Machine learning receives criticism due to its black-box properties. The current intermediate feature representations are insufficient to explain the causality of its inference process. In the case of IV, the consequences of lacking interpretability could be catastrophic. Thus, providing clear and understandable interpretations for the motion planner is crucial in enhancing trust in intelligent vehicles (IVs). Moreover, this approach could assist in predicting and rectifying potential issues that may jeopardize the safety of the passengers.}
  \item [$\bullet$]
    %Tackling the problem of the uninterpretability of end-to-end methods. Many researchers enhance interpretability by generating interpretable intermediate representations in the latent layer. The exploration of employing these representations for end-to-end methods represents a research direction for IVs.
    \textcolor{black}{ Sim2Real: The simulation and the real environment have obvious differences in scenario diversity and environment complexity, making it challenging to align simulation data with real data \cite{SE1, SE2}. Consequently, the well-trained models in simulators may not optimally perform in real settings. Developing a model to bridge the gap between simulated and real environments is critical to address the challenges about data diversity and fairness, which is also a crucial research direction in end-to-end planning.}

  \item [$\bullet$]

    %Managing the problem of hacker attacks on IVs, present defenses are proven inadequate against SOTA attacks, and the development of robust defense techniques against such attacks carries important research implications.
    \textcolor{black}{Reliability: One critical bottleneck that impedes the development and deployment of IVs is the prohibitively high economic and time costs required to validate their reliability. Constructing an artificial-intelligence-based algorithm that can identify the corner cases in a short time is a key direction for the validation of IVs.}
  \item [$\bullet$]
    %Facing challenges for decision-making in complex scenarios. Integrating human cognitive abilities into autonomous driving and a comprehensive understanding of scenario features is an effective way to overcome the present limitations.
    \textcolor{black}{Governance: IV is not only a technical issue, the sound policy is also crucial. Designing a framework that includes safety standards, data privacy regulations, and ethical guidelines is necessary to govern the development and deployment of IVs. This framework will promote accountability and transparency, reduce risks, and ensure that the public interest is defended.}

    % \item [5)]
    % Giving the challenges posed by the robustness and generalizability of planning methods, the well-trained large model in ChatCPT \cite{Chat1} shows surpassing human-level capability in solving complex problems. This holds true in the domain of autonomous driving as well, where a promising future direction concerns rationalizing the application of large models.
    % \item[6)]
    
    % Confronting with the challenge of datasets migration from virtual to real, the description principle \cite{miao2023parallel} of parallel system theory may serve as an efficacious solution. By coupling the two types of data using the description principle, a feedback loop is generated, which enables circular self-optimization.

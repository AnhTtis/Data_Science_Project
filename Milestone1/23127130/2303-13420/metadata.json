    "abstract": "In this work, we identify and characterize intra-pulse intensity noise shaping by saturable absorbers applied in mode-locked lasers and ultra-low noise nonlinear fiber amplifiers. Reshaped intra-pulse intensity noise distributions are shown to be inevitably interconnected with self-amplitude modulation, the fundamental physical mechanism for initiation and stabilization of ultra-short pulses in the steady-state of a mode-locked laser. A theoretical model is used to describe the ultrafast saturation dynamics by an intra-pulse noise transfer function for widely-applied slow and fast saturable absorbers. For experimental verification of the theoretical results, spectrally-resolved relative intensity noise measurements are applied on chirped input pulses to enable the direct measurement of intra-pulse noise transfer functions using a versatile experimental platform. It is further demonstrated, how the characterized intra-pulse intensity noise distribution of ultrafast laser systems can be utilized for quantum-limited intensity noise suppression via tailored optical bandpass filtering.",

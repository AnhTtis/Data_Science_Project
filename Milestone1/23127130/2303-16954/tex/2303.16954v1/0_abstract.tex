% 1) What is done here? 
We present a hierarchical Bayesian learning approach to infer jointly sparse parameter vectors from multiple measurement vectors. 
Our model uses separate conditionally Gaussian priors for each parameter vector and common gamma-distributed hyper-parameters to enforce joint sparsity. 
% 4. What are the key findings? 
The resulting joint-sparsity-promoting priors are combined with existing Bayesian inference methods to generate a new family of algorithms. 
% 5. What are the implications of these findings? 
Our numerical experiments, which include a multi-coil magnetic resonance imaging application, demonstrate that our new approach consistently outperforms commonly used hierarchical Bayesian methods.

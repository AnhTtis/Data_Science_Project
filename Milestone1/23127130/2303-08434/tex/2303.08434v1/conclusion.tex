\section{Conclusions}

% In this paper, we proposed DeDA, an image processing operation symmetric to the grid sampling within the forward-backward neural network learning framework to explicitly encode the prior information of rim into networks.
% This DeDA operation can also be regarded as a generalized discrete Radon transform, as it maps values between two discrete functional space through accumulation.
% Experimental results show that our proposed methods outperform other state-of-the-art methods in all evaluation metrics by a significant margin.  
% In addition, DeDA is a general image processing and can be applied in other applications such as Hough transform, bilateral grid and Polar transform.
% We believe DeDA can benefit more medical applications in the future.

We present DeDA, an image processing operation that helps parameterize rim and effectively incorporates prior information into networks through a value accumulation process. 
The experimental results demonstrate that DeDA surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in all evaluation metrics by a significant margin. 
Furthermore, DeDA's versatility extends beyond lesion identification and can be applied in other image processing applications such as Hough transform, bilateral grid, and Polar transform. 
We are excited about the potential of DeDA to advance numerous medical applications and other image processing tasks.

    "abstract": "We develop a microscopic theory for the multimode polariton dispersion in materials coupled to cavity radiation modes. Starting from a microscopic light-matter Hamiltonian, we devise a general strategy for obtaining simple matrix models of polariton dispersion curves based on the structure and spatial location of multi-layered 2D materials inside the optical cavity. Our theory exposes the connections between seemingly distinct models that have been employed in the literature and resolves an ambiguity that has arisen concerning the experimental description of the polaritonic band structure. We demonstrate the applicability of our theoretical formalism by fabricating various geometries of multi-layered perovskite materials coupled to cavities and demonstrating that our theoretical predictions agree with the experimental results presented here.",

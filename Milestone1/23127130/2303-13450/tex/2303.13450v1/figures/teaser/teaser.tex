    \captionof{figure}{Set-the-Scene allows generating composable and controllable scenes from text prompts and 3D object proxies. (left) The scene is represented using a set of proxies, defining the location, coarse shape, and text prompt of each target object. A set of NeRFs are then optimized with respect to the object proxies and an additional scene text prompt. (right) By manipulating the proxies, the scene can be edited without additional fine-tuning.}

    \caption{{\bf Set-the-Scene Training pipeline.}  A scene is first defined using a set of proxies, where each proxy is coupled with a location and a text prompt. Given an input scene, we then apply a global-local training procedure where we alternate between locally optimizing each object on its own and optimizing the entire scene rendered together as a whole.}

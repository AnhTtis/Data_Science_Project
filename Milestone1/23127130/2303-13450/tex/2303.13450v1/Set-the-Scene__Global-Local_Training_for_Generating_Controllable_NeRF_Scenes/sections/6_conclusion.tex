\section{Conclusion}
In this paper we have presented Set-the-Scene, a method for generating controllable scenes using a composable NeRF representation.
Our method builds upon two main techniques.
First, a composable NeRF representation where each object in the scene is represented using a dedicated NeRF with its placement controlled using an object proxy.
Second, a Global-Local optimization process.
Building on the flexibility of the composable representation, each object is locally optimized based on its text prompt, while also getting optimized globally with the rest of the scene.
This allows us to create complete scenes, with objects that are consistent with one another.

Set-the-Scene is shown to be superior compared to existing text-to-3D solutions in terms of control and editing capabilities.
Additionally, our method can easily be applied on top of any existing optimization-based single-object text-to-3D solution, enhancing them with several forms of control over the object proxies, as well as easy-to-use editing techniques that require little to no fine-tuning.
We believe Set-the-Scene to be a useful step forward towards a more controllable text-to-3D future.

    "abstract": "Graph Laplacian based algorithms for data lying on a manifold have been proven effective for tasks such as dimensionality reduction, clustering, and denoising. In this work, we consider data sets whose data points not only lie on a manifold, but are also closed under the action of a continuous group. An example of such a data set is volumes that lie on a low dimensional manifold, where each volume may be rotated in three-dimensional space. We introduce the G-invariant graph Laplacian that generalizes the graph Laplacian by accounting for the action of the group on the data set. We show that like the standard graph Laplacian, the G-invariant graph Laplacian converges to the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the data manifold, but with a significantly improved convergence rate. Furthermore, we show that the eigenfunctions of the G-invariant graph Laplacian admit the form of tensor products between the group elements and eigenvectors of certain matrices, which can be computed efficiently using FFT-type algorithms. We demonstrate our construction and its advantages on the problem of filtering data on a noisy manifold closed under the action of the special unitary group SU(2).",

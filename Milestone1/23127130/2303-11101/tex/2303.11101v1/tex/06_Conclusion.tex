\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we present a novel OpenSSL problem, where a large-scale open-set can be utilized in self-supervised learning on a fine-grained target dataset. 
Thereafter, we propose SimCore algorithm, which samples the effective coreset from an open-set with semantics similar to the target dataset.
We demonstrate that the coreset samples enhance representation learning for any fine-grained downstream tasks.
We believe that our approach will stimulate more investigation into fine-grained SSL with the open-set in the future.

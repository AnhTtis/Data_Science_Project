\subsection{Different Downstream Tasks}

\paragraph{kNN classifier:}
We have shown the linear evaluation performance on each fine-grained dataset to evaluate the quality of learned representation.
Here, we evaluate on another downstream task, nearest neighbor\,(NN) classification.
The NN classification is a nonparametric way to classify test images, making the prediction via weighted voting of nearest neighbors\cite{wu2018unsupervised, caron2020unsupervised}.
Table\,\ref{tab:knn_classification} summarizes the 20 NN and 200 NN classifier results, presenting that SimCore shows the best accuracy, except for Birds where every accuracy was low.

\paragraph{Semi-supervised learning:}
In addition, when part of the datasets becomes labeled by expert annotators, we can use those labels to further fine-tune the entire network. Here, we followed the semi-supervised learning protocol in \cite{chen2020simple, grill2020bootstrap}, where the randomly selected samples are annotated and used in the fine-tuning. In Table\,\ref{tab:semi-supervised_learning}, we show the results with three label ratios, each trained with 100 epochs.  
SimCore again showed the best results overall, by particularly large margins in Aircraft and Pet datasets. 
For other semi-supervised learning algorithms, refer to Appendix\,\ref{subsec:additional_finetuning}.

\paragraph{Object detection and pixel-wise segmentation:}
For object detection, we used RetinaNet detector\cite{lin2017focal} with ResNet50 encoder and trained for 100 epochs. The metric is mAP evaluated as in\cite{lin2014microsoft}, averaging over 10 IoU thresholds from 0.5 to 0.95 with a step size 0.05. $\text{mAP}_\text{50}$ is the mAP when IoU threshold is 0.5. For pixel-wise segmentation, we used DeepLabV3+ segmentation model\cite{chen2018encoder} and trained for 30 epochs. In Table\,\ref{tab:detection_segmentation}, our SimCore-pretrained encoder could more effectively identify the vehicle objects and segregate the foreground part of pet and bird images.

\paragraph{Multi-attribute classification:}
Fine-grained images are often distinguished by multiple attributes. For example, one might ask if the aircraft images could be classified by manufacturers\,(\eg, Boeing), families\,(\eg, Boeing 737), or variants\,(\eg, Boeing 737-700). 
The Cars dataset can also be identified by brands\,(\eg, Audi) or types\,(\eg, Coupe), in addition to the models\,(\eg, Audi TTS Coupe 2012) we used in linear evaluation. 
To this end, we evaluated our pretrained models on multi-attribute classification tasks of three fine-grained datasets, and SimCore excelled the baselines in every task (see Table\,\ref{tab:multi-attribute_classification}).

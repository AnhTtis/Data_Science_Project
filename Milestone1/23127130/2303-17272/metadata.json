    "abstract": "Until recently, theoretical and experimental studies of photoelectron angular distributions (PAD) including non-dipole effects in atomic photoionization have been performed for the conventional plane-wave radiation. One can expect, however, that the non-dipole contributions to the angular- and polarization-resolved photoionization properties are enhanced if an atomic target is exposed to the twisted light. The purpose of the present study is to develop a theory of PADs to the case of the twisted light and especially for many-electron atoms. Theoretical analysis is performed for the experimentally relevant case of macroscopic atomic targets, i.e. when the cross-sectional area of a target is larger than the characteristic transversal size of a twisted beam. For such a scenario we derive expressions for the angular distribution of emitted photoelectrons under the influence of twisted Bessel beams. As an illustrative example we consider helium photoionization in the region of the lowest dipole $2s2p\\,[{^1P}_1]$ and quadrupole $2p^2\\,[{^1D}_2]$ autoionization resonances. A noticeable variation of PAD caused by changing of the twisted light parameters is predicted.",

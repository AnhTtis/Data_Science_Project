    "abstract": "We study the masses and production modes of pentaquark with the quark constituent $c\\bar qqqq$, by the tridiquark-diquark model and systematical light flavor quark symmetry SU(3) analysis. The mass splittings show that the S-wave singly charm pentaquark $c\\bar s us s, c \\bar d dss$ with parity $\\frac{1}{2}^-$ are near their strong decay thresholds $Ξ_c η, Ω_c π$ respectively, which may imply the possibility of stable states. Furthermore, we discuss the production from $B$ mesons, the analysis within SU(3) symmetry yields the golden channels of production process, $\\overline B^0\\to S_{0}^+ Ξ^-,\\ \\overline B^0_s\\to S_{-1}^0 Λ^0$, which expected to be work worthily in b-factory.",

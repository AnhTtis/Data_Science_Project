    "abstract": "We consider a class of degenerate elliptic fully nonlinear equations with applications to Grad equations:\n  \\begin{align}\n  \\begin{cases}\n  |Du|^γ\\mathcal{M}_{λ,Λ}^+\\big(D^2u(x)\\big)=f\\big(|u\\geq u(x)|\\big) &\\text{ in }Ω,\n  u=g &\\text{ on }\\partialΩ,\n  \\end{cases}\n  \\end{align}\n  where $γ\\geq 1$ is a constant, $Ω$ is a bounded domain in $\\mathbb{R}^N$ with $C^{1,1}$ boundary. We prove the existence of a $W^{2,p}$-viscosity solution to the above equation, which degenerates when the gradient of the solution vanishes.",

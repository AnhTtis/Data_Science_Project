\section{Human evaluation study details} \label{sec:mturk}
Raters were selected based on the criteria that they be located in the US, and had attempted a minimum of 500 HITS at an accepted work rate greater than 97\% on MTurk.
 We asked raters on MTurk to answer if a candidate response satisfied each of the qualitative measures (interesting, furthering and related) and gave them three response options: "Yes", "Somewhat" and "No". In a pilot study of $360$ responses, we also included a measure for fluency. All of the responses were rated ``Yes" by majority vote and we removed this measure from further analysis as all the generations in this study were fluent as indicated by the pilot study and from our observation. For correlation calculations, we assign integer score values to each of the three response options as $3$ for "Yes", $2$ for "Somewhat" and $1$ for "No". Thus, the higher the score, the better the response is rated. Following the pilot study, for 194 dialogue histories, we showed the raters 4 candidate dialogue responses (total of 776 dialogue responses) and collected ratings on all *3* measures from *3* raters per dialogue history. In all, we obtained a total of 776*3, i.e., 2328 total response-rating pairs. To calculate the score for each response along every measure, we take the mean of all ratings as the score. For cases where at least 2 out of 3 raters agree, we take majority vote  as the final score. This constituted (2018 out of 2328) 86.68\% of all the ratings collected. We show the overall distribution of qualitative scores for all the response-rating pairs in Figure \ref{fig:human_data_dist}. We verified the rater responses by checking if they were rating human-generated responses highly as those came from a trusted source (Persona-Chat). We also manually inspected a random subset of dialog history-candidate response sets and found the results to be in accordance with our intuitions.

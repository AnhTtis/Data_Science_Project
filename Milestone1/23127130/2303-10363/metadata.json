    "abstract": "We construct an action of the Thompson group F on a compact space built from pairs of infinite, binary rooted trees. The action arises as an F-equivariant compactification of the action of F by translations on one of its homogeneous spaces, F/H_2, corresponding to a certain subgroup H_2 of F. The representation of F on the Hilbert space l^2(F/H_2) is faithful on the complex group algebra C[F].",

\section{Ethical Considerations}
Our research is non-commercial, and in line with Twitter’s Terms and Conditions for research purposes, our data will not be shared with any third party for commercial purposes.
We used the standard Twitter API to collect tweets from public user profiles. In all of our experiments, any result produced and shown cannot be used to re-identify, or track said users, as no user profiles are specifically named. During our experiments, we follow ethical guidelines outlined in~\cite{rivers2014ethical}.
Given our experimentation on human-produced data, we obtained IRB approval\footnote{Reference no: 520211000835379} from our institution.

\subsection{$\mu$RWELL-based Inner Tracker}

\subsubsection{Detector Design}

$\mu$RWELL~\cite{itk8,itk9,itk10} is a single-amplification stage resistive micropattern gaseous detector.
It has been introduced as a thin, simple and robust detector for very large area applications requiring operation in harsh radiation environments.
Figure~\ref{fig:4.1.02} shows the schematic structure of the inner tracker system based on the $\mu$RWELL detector, consisting of 3 cylindrical detector layers  with inner radii of 60~mm, 110~mm and 160~mm, and full-length of 330~mm, 610~mm, and 880~mm.
The radii are determined based on the radiation tolerance of the $\mu$RWELL detector and the MDC range according to the background simulation in Sec.~\ref{sec:mdi_bkg}. The innermost wire layer of the MDC (Sec.~\ref{sec:mdc}) has a radius of approximately 200~mm. The radii of the three layers of the $\mu$RWELL-based inner tracker ensure uniform gaps between the inner tracker hits and the first MDC hit.
The 3 layers are functionally and structurally independent of each other, thus simplifying the manufacturing and maintenance processes. As illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:4.1.02} (right), each detector layer consists of 2 cylinders and 4 pairs of sealing rings. The inner cylinder  has a sandwich-like structure made of polyimide film and supporting material, providing a detector frame with sufficient mechanical strength. The outer surface of the inner cylinder  is coated with a thin aluminum foil, acting as the drift cathode of the $\mu$RWELL detector. The outer cylinder  is the cylindrical $\mu$RWELL foil, which acts as both an electron multiplier and signal readout unit. Four pairs of sealing rings are located at both ends of the cylindrical detector, sealing the gap between the polyimide films and the $\mu$RWELL foil. The space between the inner cylinder  and the outer cylinder  is the gas volume. To ensure the gas tightness of the detector, each seam of the gas volume is sealed with epoxy resin.

A very low material budget is crucial for the measurement of low-momentum charged particles. It is essential to reduce the material contributions of the inner tracker.
In this baseline design, the mechanical strength of the detector is mainly provided by the sandwich-like inner cylinder , and the material budget in the detection area can be limited to a very low level, as shown in Table~\ref{tab:4.1.01}.

\subsubsection{Detector Simulation and Optimization}

%\paragraph{Working point and gas component optimization}
%\quad\\
To obtain optimal detection performance from the $\mu$RWELL-based inner tracker, it is crucial to determine the working point and gas component.
Based on a simulation study with {\sc Garfield-9}~\cite{garfield9} and {\sc Geant4}~\cite{geant4}, the impact of these parameters on the detector spatial resolution is investigated, and the detector design is optimized.
\quad\\
The spatial resolution is dependent on various detector parameters, such as the drift electric field strength, working gas component and width of the gas volume. The optimization of these parameters must take into account the effect of the 1~T magnetic field in the $z$-direction. To simplify the optimization, the full simulation starts from an ideal gas component. Figure~\ref{fig:4.1.ideal gas component} shows the Geant4 simulated spatial resolution as a function of various parameters being studied. The Lorentz angle and the electron drift velocity have optimal values of approximately 30 degrees and 2~cm/$\mu$s, respectively. Additionally, a larger gas volume width and a smaller transverse diffusion coefficient enhance the spatial resolution. The optimal Lorentz angle, electron drift velocity and transverse diffusion coefficient can be realized by choosing a suitable gas component and electric field. However, a larger gas volume width leads to a longer signal duration time, decreasing the counting rate capabilities and increasing the occupancy ratio of the detector. As a compromise, the gap width is set to 5~mm.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

It is feasible to realize the expected performance of the gas mixture by adding an appropriate type and proportion of doping gas to the noble gas. With the {\sc Garfield-9} simulation and the analysis of tens of different argon-based gas mixtures, a suitable working gas component is found, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:4.2.real gas component}. The {\sc Garfield-9} simulation shows that the gas mixture of Ar:CO$_{2}$=85:15 gives a Lorentz angle of 29.2 degrees, an electron drift velocity of 2.34~cm/$\mu$s, and a transverse diffusion coefficient of 191~$\mu$m/$\sqrt{\mathrm{cm}}$, with a drift electric field strength of 500~V/cm. All the parameters are within the preferred ranges, indicating that this gas mixture could be a suitable working gas for the $\mu$RWELL-based inner tracker.

\subsubsection{Detector Performance}


%\paragraph{Spatial resolution of single point}
%\quad\\
A previous study~\cite{itk12} on $\mu$RWELL indicates that, with the $\mu$-time projection chamber (TPC) %Editor: Please ensure that the intended meaning has been maintained in this edit.
mode, the spatial resolution of the detector is almost flat over a wide range of incidence angles, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:4.3.spatial resolution simulation result} (a). In the $\mu$-TPC mode, each ionization cluster is projected into a 2-D spatial and 1-D time distribution inside the conversion gap. With the drift time measurement of the primary ionized electrons, the track segment in the gas volume can be reconstructed, and a precise spatial resolution can be obtained. In this mode, the $\mu$RWELL detector can achieve a spatial resolution of approximately 100~$\mu$m.
The spatial resolution of different types of particles with the same transverse momentum of 100 MeV/c is determined by using {\sc Geant4} simulation, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:4.3.spatial resolution simulation result}. The spatial resolution in the $r-\phi$ and beamline directions can be limited below 100~$\mu$m and 450~$\mu$m, respectively. Additionally, positively charged particles have a better spatial resolution than negatively charged particles due to the influence of the magnetic field. Both charged particles and ionized electrons are deflected during migration in the $\mu$RWELL gap since the Lorenz angle is not 0 in the magnetic field. For positively charged particles, the deflection directions of primary particles and ionized electrons are opposite, leading to a larger track projection range. For negative particles, the deflection directions of primary particles and ionized electrons are the same, resulting in a smaller tracker projection range. In the $\mu$-TPC mode, a larger track range is beneficial to the tracking performance. Thus, positively charged particles have a better spatial resolution than negatively charged particles.

%%%% material budget
To investigate the impact of the material budget on the performance of the ITK, the expected momentum resolution and position resolution with different material budgets, ranging from 0.15\%$X_0$ to 0.45\%$X_0$, are compared.
A single hit position resolution of $100\times400$~$\mu$m is assumed.
The results are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:4.3.11} and are obtained from {\sc Geant4} simulation with a combined tracking fitting of the MDC + ITK tracking system. The incident particles ($\pi$) are assumed to have a polar angle of cos$\theta=0$.
In the low momentum range, the momentum resolution degrades with a higher material budget.
%Another important factor that needs to be considered is the track finding and reconstruction efficiency.

\subsubsection{Counting rate and layout of readout strips}
%\paragraph{Readout channel, electronics, counting rate and data size estimation}
%\quad\\
From the background simulation study, the highest background count rate in the inner tracker appears in the first layer and is approximately 26.8~kHz/cm$^{2}$ (as discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:mdi_bkg} at the peak luminosity. This is well within the rate capability of the uRWELL detector technology. For example, it has been demonstrated that a $\mu$RWELL detector with 400~$\mu$m pitch strips has a rate capability ranging from a few tens of
kHz/cm$^2$ up to a few MHz/cm$^2$~\cite{itk10}.

In the $\mu$RWELL-ITK conceptual design,, two-dimensional readout strips ($X$ and $V$) are used with a crossing angle of 15 degrees, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:muRWELL_XV}. The $X$ readout strip is along the beamline direction. Both the X and V strips have a pitch of 400~$\mu$m in all 3 layers of the $\mu$RWELL film and cover a polar angle acceptance of $20^{\circ}$ $<$ $\theta$ $<$ $160^{\circ}$. Considering that the radii of the 3 $\mu$RWELL layers are 60~mm, 110~mm and 160~mm, the numbers of readout channels are 1919, 3517, and 5116, respectively, with 10552 in total. 
With this readout strips layout, each hit generates 10 signals in the X strips and 10 signals in the V strips on average, resulting in a highest count rate per channel as 367~kHz. This background level corresponds to an occupancy of 11.2\%, 5.4\%, and 5.32\% with a time window of 400~ns for the three layers of inner tracker, respectively. Obviously, it is necessary to optimize the detector design, particularly the layout of readout strips  to reduce the occupancy to a acceptable level. Splitting the X and V strips at Z = 0 into two parts would be one of the effective ways to decrease the occupancy. The average number of hits produced by the passage of a charged particle on the detector can be reduced by optimizing the gas gap width and the working gas. This would be another way to reduced the occupancy.

\subsubsection{R\&D on Cylindrical $\mu$RWELL}
%\quad\\
Several kinds of structure supporting materials have been tested, of which aramid honeycomb~\cite{itk13} and Rohacell foam~\cite{itk14} showed good performance in terms of both material budget and mechanical strength. Additionally, two bonding methods have been developed for the aramid honeycomb and Rohacell foam. A solid sandwich structure with a very low material budget of adhesive is feasible. Fig.~\ref{fig:4.1.06} shows a sandwich-like inner cylinder  made of the two kinds of material, and Table~\ref{tab:4.1.03} presents the performance of these cylinder . The mechanical strength of 2~mm aramid honeycomb is sufficient, while that of 1~mm Rohacell foam is lower. Thus, in the next step, thinner aramid honeycomb and thicker Rohacell foam will be manufactured and tested. Additionally, the study of a new X/V strip readout is still ongoing.

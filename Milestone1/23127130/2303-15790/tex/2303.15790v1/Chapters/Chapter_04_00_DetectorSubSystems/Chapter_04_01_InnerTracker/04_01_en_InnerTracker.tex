\section{Inner Tracker~(ITK)}
\label{sec:itk}

\subsection{Introduction}
The STCF physics programs demand high detection efficiency and good spatial resolution for charged particle tracks while imposing no explicit requirements on vertex reconstruction. As a consequence, the main tasks of the STCF inner tracker are to detect particle hits of charged particles, especially those with very low momentum, below 100~MeV/c, and to facilitate the reconstruction of charged particle tracks with the MDC. In this chapter, the performance requirements of the inner tracker and the conceptual baseline designs are described. The resulting expected performance is also discussed through a simulation study.

\subsection{Performance Requirements and Technology Choices}
The major performance requirements for the inner tracker for realizing the expected detection capabilities are listed below:
\begin{itemize}
\item Low material budget: about 0.25\% X/X$_{0}$ for each detector layer.
\item Spatial resolution: single-hit spatial resolution better than 100~$\mu$m in the $r-\phi$ direction. 
\item  Detector occupancy: not exceeding a few percent.
\item Radiation tolerance requirements as described in Sec.~\ref{sec:mdi_bkg}.
\end{itemize}

Several detector technologies can fulfill the requirements above, such as micropattern gaseous detectors (MPGDs) and silicon pixel detectors. 
A silicon pixel detector~ \cite{itk1} was used as the vertex detector at the STAR~\cite{itk2} and Belle II~\cite{itk3} experiments, showing good performance in spatial resolution and rate capabilities \cite{itk4}. MPGD-based detectors, 
a cylindrical gas electron multiplier (CGEM) detector~\cite{itk5}, was used as the inner tracker for the KLOE~\cite{itk6} detector and the BESIII upgrade~\cite{itk7}.

In the CDR of the STCF, an MPGD-based design is the baseline choice for the inner track, while a silicon pixel detector is considered to be an alternative design. The sensitive lengths in each of the layers are determined by the required angular acceptance, {\it i.e.}, a polar angle range of 20 degrees to 160 degrees.

\subsection{Pileup and Radiation Effects}

\subsubsection{Pileup Effects}

The STCF detector is expected to operate at an event rate as high as 400 kHz (Sec.~\ref{sec:tdaq}). With such a high event rate, the probability of events overlapping is approximately 8 (18)\% within a time window of 200 (500) ns. This indicates that fast response or good timing performance is required for detectors to cope with such a high event rate. Recent studies ~\cite{aplide-improved,malta2} have shown that depleted MAPS (DMPAS) with improved sensor designs and processes could provide a timing resolution of about 2~ns or better. Such excellent timing capability would be very helpful in solving the overlapping events by providing each charged track with precise time measurement. 

% radition and aging effects
\subsubsection{Radiation Effects}
As the innermost subdetector of the STCF detector, the ITK receives the highest level of background radiation.  Radiation hardness is a crucial factor in the design of the ITK.
A detailed background radiation simulation is described in Sec.~\ref{sec:mdi_bkg}, and the expected radiation levels in individual subdetectors are given in Table~\ref{tab:TIDNIEL_mean} and \ref{tab:TIDNIEL_max}.
However, note that the radiation simulation in Sec.~\ref{sec:mdi_bkg} 
 is subject to large uncertainties since many technical details for the designs of the accelerator and the machine detector interface are not available yet at the conceptual design stage. In addition, beam background usually can't be simulated precisely given too many factors in the simulation that can't be well determined. For example, significant discrepancies between simulation and actual measurement of beam background have been observed in the Belle II experiment~\cite{belle2bkg}. Therefore, sufficient safety margins have to be taken into account when assessing beam background levels. 

 From Table~\ref{tab:TIDNIEL_max}, the TID and NIEL of the uRWELL-based ITK are 120 Gy/y and $1.1\times 10^{10}$~n/cm$^{2}$/y~(1 MeV neutron equivalent), respectively. Those of the MAPS-based ITK are 3.5~kGy/y and a NIEL of $1.8\times 10^{11}$~n/cm$^{2}$/y, respectively. These levels of radiation are well below the limits of the state of the art MPGD and MAPS detectors. For example, The ALPIDE pixel sensor for the ALICE-ITS has been demonstrated to have a radiation hardness of up to $10^{13}$~n/cm$^{2}$ (NIEL) and 27~kGy~\cite{alpide2}.

For the $\mu$RWELL-based ITK, potential degradation of performance due to aging effects, such as a
specific gas gain reduction or high voltage instabilities during operation caused by irradiation, should be considered.
In general, aging is induced by plasma-chemical processes during gas amplification processes.
A complete overview and description of the aging phenomena in gaseous detectors can be found in Ref.~\cite{gaseousaging}.
A dedicated aging study is planned for the $\mu$RWELL-based ITK. During the long-term operation of the STCF, it can be replaced if it malfunctions due to radiation damage.

\subsection{Conclusion and Outlook}
The cylindrical $\mu$RWELL-based detector, with the advantages of low material budget, robustness, scalability, and simplified manufacturing and maintenance processes, is the baseline design of the STCF inner tracker and is expected to provide promising performance. Additional studies are needed in the future to realize the baseline design and to further optimize the detector performance, including material budget limitation, optimization of the cylindrical $\mu$RWELL detector structure, manufacturing of the detector prototype and performance testing. As an alternative design choice, CMOS silicon pixel detectors are being considered. They are expected to provide better vertex resolution and greater radiation hardness. It will be crucial to continue the pixel sensor R\&D program and to develop CMOS pixel sensors with radiation tolerance, lower power consumption and fast readout electronics.
The expected performance of the different ITK designs are discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:mdc}, taking into account both the inner tracker and outer tracker.

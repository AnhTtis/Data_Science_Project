\subsubsection{R-value}
The $R$ value is defined as
\begin{equation}
   R(s) = \frac{\sigma_{\rm tot} ( e^+ e^- \to \gamma^* \to  {\rm hadrons)}}{\sigma (e^+e^-\to \gamma^* \to \mu^+ \mu^-)},
\end{equation}
which is a function of $s$. This quantity plays an important role in determining the running of electroweak coupling and in the study of precision
tests of SM. This can be seen in a recent study of global SM-fit\cite{Gfit}. $R(s)$ is also important for $g$-2 problem.
It is absolutely clear that more precise results on the $R$-value will be obtained at STCF.

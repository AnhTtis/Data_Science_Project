\section{Charmonium and XYZ Physics}
%At STCF it is an ideal place to study charmonium states and the exotic states containing a $c\bar c$ pair.
%For these states with the quantum number $J^{PC} = 1^{--}$ they can be copiously produced in their threshold
%energy regions. For states with other quantum numbers they can be searched in certain decay products.
%With the design luminosity, large event numbers of the states with the quantum numbers other than $1^{--}$
%can be expected. With the energy regions of STCF, a systematic study of highly excited charmonium states
%and $XYZ$-states can be performed with the statistics never reached before. The mass spectrum of charmonia below the $D\bar D$ threshold has been successfully described with the quark model with a confining potential between a charm- and an anti-charm quark. However, many excited charmonium
%states predicted by the model are still missing, or their properties are poolly known.
%The $XYZ$ states discovered in the last decade can not be predicted by the quark model, or it has difficulties
%to explain the existence of $XYZ$ states. It is unclear if they are hadronic molecule, tetraquark states, hadro-charmonia and threshold effects. Experimentally, the answers of these questions can be found at STCF
%combined with studies of theory.

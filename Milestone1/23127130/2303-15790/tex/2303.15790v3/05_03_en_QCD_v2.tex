The formation of the observed hadrons from QCD partons is still not understood. Experimentally, an $e^+e-$ collider is a suitable place to
study hadronization because its initial states are leptons, whereas such studies at a hadron collider will suffer from uncertainties due to the presence of initial hadrons.
At the STCF, such a study can be performed by measuring the $R$ value for a totally inclusive cross section and by measuring the inclusive production
of one or two hadrons. The latter will provide important information about various parton fragmentation functions.
In addition to inclusive processes, exclusive processes will also be studied at the STCF. There are interesting near-threshold phenomena
in $e^+e^-\to B\bar B$, where $B$ is a baryon. Because the STCF will run at center-of-mass energies of up to 7 GeV, it will be possible to exclusively produce two charmonia. The study of the exclusive and inclusive
production of quarkonia will provide important tests of theoretical predictions of nonrelativistic QCD.

In addition to the abovementioned processes, which can be theoretically studied via perturbative QCD at a certain level, many phenomena at the STCF are totally nonperturbative.
These nonperturbative processes can also be well studied at the STCF to provide more insights
into nonperturbative QCD and even new physics beyond the SM.

\subsection{The \texorpdfstring{$XYZ$}{} puzzles}

The STCF is an ideal place to study charmonium states and exotic states containing a $c\bar c$ pair.
Before 2003, it was thought that charmonium states, being bound states of a charm and an anticharm quark, should be well described by nonrelativistic potential quark models.
However, since the discovery of the $X(3872)$ by Belle in 2003, a large number of new resonance(-like) structures have been observed in the charmonium mass region by various experiments, including BESIII, BaBar, Belle, CDF, D0, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb (see, e.g., Refs.~\cite{Swanson:2006st,Voloshin:2007dx,Chen:2016qju,Hosaka:2016pey,Lebed:2016hpi,Esposito:2016noz,Guo:2017jvc,Ali:2017jda,Olsen:2017bmm,Karliner:2017qhf,Yuan:2018inv,Kou:2018napp,Cerri:2018ypt,ParticleDataGroup:2022pth,Liu:2019zoy,Brambilla:2019esw,Guo:2019twa,Chen:2022asf} for recent reviews), as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ccbarspec} in comparison with the predictions of the Godfrey--Isgur quark model~\cite{Godfrey:1985xjl}. Most of them have peculiar features that deviate from quark model expectations:
\begin{itemize}
\item The masses are a few tens of MeV away from the quark model predictions for charmonia with the same quark numbers and cannot be easily accommodated in quark model spectra. Examples include the $X(3872)$, $Y(4260)$, and $Y(4360)$ masses; see Fig.~\ref{fig:ccbarspec}.
\item All of the $XYZ$ states are above or at least in the vicinity of the open-charm thresholds. For those above the thresholds, one would expect them to predominantly decay into open-charm channels because of the OZI rule. However, many of them have only been seen as peaks in final states of a charmonium and light mesons/photon. For instance, four resonant structures have been observed in the $J/\psi\phi$ final states, namely, $X(4140)$, $X(4274)$, $X(4500)$ and $X(4700)$, while no $XYZ$ signal was reported in open-charm channels.
\item Charged structures have been observed, including the $Z_c(3900)$, $Z_c(4020)$, $Z_c(4050)$, $Z_c(4250)$, $Z_c(4200)$ and $Z_c(4430)$. More recently, charged $Z_{cs}$ structures with explicit strangeness have also been reported~\cite{Ablikim:2020hsk,Aaij:2021ivw}. If they are hadron resonances, they must contain at least four quarks, making them explicitly exotic multiquark states beyond the conventional quark model.
\end{itemize}
Because of these features, $XYZ$ particles are excellent candidates for exotic hadrons, which include hadronic molecules, tetraquarks, hadro-charmonia and hybrids in this context and have been sought for decades.

Within the energy region of the STCF at the designed luminosity, a large number of states with the quantum numbers $J^{PC} = 1^{--}$ can be produced. States with other quantum numbers can also be searched for in certain decay products.
A systematic study of the intriguing $XYZ$ states and related highly excited charmonium states can thus be performed with unprecedented statistics. With collaborative inputs from theory and lattice QCD~(LQCD), answers to the $XYZ$ puzzles and a deeper understanding of how color confinement organizes the QCD spectrum are foreseen.

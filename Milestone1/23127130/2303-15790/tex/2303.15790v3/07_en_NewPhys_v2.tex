\section{New light particles beyond the SM}
\label{sec:newphys}
In this section, we briefly describe the beyond the SM~(BSM) motivations for the STCF. Since the Higgs boson was discovered, for the first time, a complete theory is available to describe the electroweak and strong interactions. A drawback
to the success of the SM is that one loses guidance for future directions of research. Under such circumstances, one must scrutinize all possibilities, such as the STCF, super B factories, the LHC and other facilities, to find clues on how to proceed. %{\color{red}
The STCF, with its high luminosity, will be sensitive to new light particles and their interactions with SM particles.

We have listed
three categories of motivations in terms of BSM physics: (1) forbidden and rare decays, (2) $CP$ violation, and (3) searches for new weakly interacting light particles. Nevertheless, we should also point out that the BSM possibilities are still more extensive than those listed here,
and other new topics can also be investigated.

Here, we mainly focus on the possibility of new light particles in a hidden sector
that has weak coupling with the SM sector.
The candidates for such new light particles include dark photons,
new light scalars,
and millicharged particles.

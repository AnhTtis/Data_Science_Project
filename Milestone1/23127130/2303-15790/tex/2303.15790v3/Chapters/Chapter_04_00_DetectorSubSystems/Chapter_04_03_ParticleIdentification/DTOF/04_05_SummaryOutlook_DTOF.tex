\subsection{Summary and Outlook}


A conceptual DTOF detector design for an endcap PID detector providing effective $\pi/K/p$ identification at the STCF is presented. 
An optimum quadrantal radiator with a
thickness of 15~mm with an absorber attached to its outer surface is chosen as the baseline
design. The performance of the DTOF is investigated through MC simulation, and a
reconstruction algorithm for the DTOF is developed.
The simulation indicates an overall
reconstructed TOF time resolution of $\sim50$~ps with an average of $\sim20$ photons detected by the
MCP-PMT arrays when all the contributing factors are converted. 
It is worth noting that the
uncertainty of $T_{0}$ dominates the overall timing error; therefore, an optimal design of the STCF
bunch size is crucial. 
By applying the likelihood method, a $\pi/K$ separation power of DTOF of $\sim4\sigma$
or better at a momentum of 2~GeV/c is achieved over the entire DTOF sensitive area. This fulfills
the requirements for the PID detector at the STCF. Extensive R$\&$D works concerning DTOF
are underway to verify the 
designs and the key technical aspects.

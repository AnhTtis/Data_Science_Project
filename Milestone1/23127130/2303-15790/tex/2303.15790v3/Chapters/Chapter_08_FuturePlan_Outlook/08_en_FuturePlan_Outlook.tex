As presented in this CDR, substantial efforts on detector R\&D and physics performance are underway.
It has been demonstrated that the proposed conceptual detectors can meet the physics requirements and can feasibly be built on the timescale of the STCF project.
Moving forward, more in-depth R\&D and studies are required for the preparation of the Technical Design Report~(TDR).
These include sharpening the physics case, finalizing detector technological choices, further optimizing to improve performance and
reduce cost, designing mechanical, electrical and thermal systems, and developing installation and integration schemes.


\section{Detector cost and project timeline}
\label{sec:costs}
\label{sec:timeline}

The cost of the STCF detector is estimated to be 550~million RMB based on its conceptual design. The leading cost driver is the electromagnetic calorimeter with pure CsI crystals. 
%The current estimates of the cost of the STCF project are given in %Table~\ref{tab:stcf_cost}.

The current timeline for the STCF project is shown in Fig.~5.1.  With the completion of the conceptual design reports of the accelerator and the detector, the next phase of the project will be a 5-year period for accelerator and detector R\&D toward the completion of the Technical Design Reports of the accelerator and the detector.  The project will then move on to the construction phase spanning approximately 7 years that will eventually see both the accelerator and the detector fully constructed. An approximately 15 year data-taking period is envisaged to achieve the primary physics targets of the STCF project, and there is a possibility to upgrade the STCF with a polarized electron beam afterwards.

%The current timeline for the STCF project is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:stcf_timeline}.
%The first stage of the project is the completion of this CDR.
%The next stage is the 5-year period for detector R\&D toward the completion of the Technical Design Report (TDR).
%The construction of both the accelerator and the detectors will commence immediately after the approval of the TDR and is expected to take approximately 7 years.
%An approximately 15 year data-taking period is envisaged to achieve the physics targets of the STCF, and there is also a possibility to further upgrade the STCF project with polarized electron beam during the data-taking period.

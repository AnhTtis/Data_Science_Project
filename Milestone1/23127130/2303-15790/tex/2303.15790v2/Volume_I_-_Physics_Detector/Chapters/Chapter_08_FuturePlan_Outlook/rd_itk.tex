The inner tracker is designed to have a low material budget and fast readout and to provide high detection efficiencies for charged particles,
especially those with very low momentum, below 100 MeV/c.
It must also satisfy the stringent requirements imposed by the high luminosity and trigger rate conditions.
Two conceptual designs of the ITK have been proposed: a cylindrical $\mu$RWELL-based detector and a monolithic active pixel sensor-based detector.
Several critical R\&D items have been identified for the TDR:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\mu$RWELL-based ITK:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Manufacturing methods for large area diamond-like carbon (DLC) resistive electrodes;
      \item Electrode structure design and manufacturing methods for a large-area WELL detector and a large-area canal type (GROOVE) detector;
      \item Mechanical structure and installation method for a cylindrical detector;
      \item Design of front-end ASICs to integrate analog signal manipulation, ADC, charge and time calculations, and a high-speed data transfer interface;
      \item Design of the readout electronics, including the front-end electronics with customized ASICs, readout units, and subclock and subtrigger modules;
      \item Design, construction and characterization of a small cylindrical $\mu$RWELL detector prototype.
    \end{itemize}
  \item MAPS-based ITK:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Track reconstruction performance study and further optimization of the layout;
      \item Design of the MAPS pixel layout with optimal sensor parameters, such as low capacitance, high charge collection efficiency and short charge collection time;
      \item Design of a low-power low-noise in-pixel circuit;
      \item Design of the readout strategy for the hit signals and the architecture of on-chip readout circuitry;
      \item Design of the readout system, including readout units, power units and common readout units, for data receiving, collecting, transferring, and configuring of the MAPS;
      \item Design of the stave module, including support mechanics and a cooling system;
      \item Design, construction and characterization of a MAPS stave prototype module.
    \end{itemize}

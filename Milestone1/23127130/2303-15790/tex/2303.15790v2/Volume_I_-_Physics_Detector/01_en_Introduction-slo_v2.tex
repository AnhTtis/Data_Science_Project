\subsection{Challenges in particle physics and the \texorpdfstring{$\tau$}{}-charm energy region}
The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics, comprising the unified electroweak (EW) and quantum
chromodynamics (QCD) theories, successfully explains almost all experimental results related to the
microscopic world. For example, it successfully predicted the existence of weak neutral current interactions
and the masses, widths and many other properties of the $W^{\pm}$ and $Z^0$ bosons; large particle--antiparticle
differences, so-called $CP$ violations, in specific $B$-meson decay channels, which were subsequently
confirmed by experiments; and the existence of the Higgs scalar boson, which was discovered at CERN in
2012~\cite{Aad:2012tfa,Chatrchyan:2012ufa} --- 50 years after its existence was predicted --- with properties that closely match the model's
expectations. As a result, the SM is currently universally accepted as the theory of elementary particles
and their interactions.

However, despite its considerable successes, the SM also has a number of shortcomings, including the following:

\noindent
{\bf Many free parameters} {The SM with the minimal particle contents (the gauge particle, the generations of left-handed quark doublets, the right-handed quark singlet, the left-handed lepton doublets, the right-handed charged leptons, and the Higgs doublet)} has 19 free parameters that must be extracted from experimental measurements. These include the quark, lepton and Higgs masses; the mixing angles of the Cabibbo--Kobayashi--Maskawa (CKM) quark-flavor mixing matrix; and the couplings of the electric, weak and QCD color forces (see Fig. 1a). { If the neutrino mass problem is also considered, there are even more free parameters.}


\noindent
{\bf Baryon asymmetry of the universe}  The model's mechanism for $CP$ violation fails to explain our existence
in a matter-dominated universe by approximately ten orders of magnitude. There must be additional $CP$-violating
mechanisms in nature beyond those contained in the SM.

\noindent
{\bf Quark/gluon--hadron disconnect}  The strongly interacting particles of the SM are quarks and gluons,
whereas the strongly interacting particles that are measured in experiments are hadrons. In principle, QCD
accurately describes the transitions between quarks/gluons and hadrons. However, at the relevant distance scale
on the order of 1 fermi (see Fig. 1b), QCD is a strongly coupled theory, and perturbation theory is not directly applicable.
As a result, there is no first-principles connection between the theory and the spectrum and properties of
the particles that are actually seen in experiments.

\noindent
{\bf Gravity, dark matter, neutrino masses, number of flavors, etc.} {The SM does not include a quantized theory for gravity. It does not explain the dark matter in the universe, the neutrino masses, the number of particle generations, etc. Because of these shortcomings, the SM cannot be taken as a perfect theory. }


There is considerable enthusiasm among particle physicists to search for evidence
of new, non-SM physics phenomena. In general, this requires evaluating and testing SM predictions with
ever-increasing energies and/or levels of precision. For example, at the {\em energy frontier}, the ATLAS and CMS
experiments at CERN search for new massive particles that are not accounted for in the SM and make precise
determinations of Higgs decay coupling strengths to search for deviations from SM predictions. At the {\em intensity
frontier}, the LHCb experiment at CERN, the recently commissioned Belle II experiment at KEK, and long-baseline
neutrino experiments are searching for evidence
%of non-SM sources of $CP$ violation in the $b$- and $c$-quark and neutrino sectors, and
of deviations from SM predictions for processes that are mediated by quantum loops containing
massive virtual particles, which could be signs of the influence of non-SM particles that are too heavy to be
accessed by experiments at LHC energies. In lower energy regions, the tests of the SM include precision measurements of
$(g - 2)_\mu$; tests of the unitarity of the CKM matrix, especially the $CP$ triangle; {searches for non-SM sources of $CP$ violation in neutrinos}; searches for lepton flavor
violations; investigation of the consistency among various approaches for determining the value of the Weinberg weak interaction angle $\theta_W$;
etc. These, in general, require precisely measured values of SM parameters, usually as inputs from other sources, and
independent determinations of the influence of long-distance hadron effects. Thus, a comprehensive challenge to the
SM requires a coordinated multidimensional program that includes careful refinement of theoretical predictions
coupled with experimental measurements with state-of-the-art sensitivities.

At low energies, some of the nonperturbative effects of QCD have an important influence on the determination of
fundamental parameters. An electron--positron ($e^+e^-$) collider operating at the transition interval between
nonperturbative QCD and perturbative QCD at the few-GeV level --- a $\tau$--charm facility ---
is uniquely well suited to play an important role in the determination of these parameters. Such a facility can
address a very broad physics program covering tests of QCD, investigations of hadron spectroscopy, precise tests of electroweak interactions,
and searches for new, beyond-the-SM physics. Currently, the only facility operating in this energy region is the Beijing
Electron--Positron Collider II (BEPCII) -- BEijing Spectrometer III (BESIII)~\cite{bepcii,Ablikim:2009aa}, which has significantly advanced progress
in elementary particle physics. A comprehensive description of the physics program and potential of BESIII can be found in Refs.~\cite{Asner:2008nq,beswhite}. BESIII has been in operation for more than 10 years and will complete its mission soon. An advanced facility that will continue investigating and extend
to additional research topics in the relevant energy region with significantly enhanced sensitivity is therefore necessary to address many of the remaining unsolved problems. A Super
$\tau$--Charm Facility (STCF), with a luminosity higher by two orders of magnitude,

would be a natural extension and a viable option.
The successful construction and operation of the proposed STCF would play a crucial role in continuing China's leading worldwide role in
research at the high-intensity frontier of elementary particle physics.


%The SM has 19 free parameters that must be supplied by precision experiments. The discoveries of the
%charmed mesons and the $\tau$ lepton as well as the successful mapping of the charmonium meson spectrum in the 20th century
%opened a window to the rich physics program that is addressable in the $\tau$--charm region. The original BES
%experiment's determination of the $\tau$-lepton mass provided a stringent test of lepton flavor universality in combination with other measurements, such as couplings,
%and precision measurements of the cross section for $e^+e^-$ annihilation into hadrons by BESII were crucial inputs
%for fits to the electroweak sector of the model that provided an accurate prediction of the Higgs boson mass, prior
%to its discovery in 2012. BESIII has also made the world's most precise measurements of the $|V_{cs}|$ and $|V_{cd}|$
%elements of the Kobayashi--Maskawa quark-flavor mixing matrix. A deeper understanding of the underlying theory
%of the fundamental interactions will require even more precise measurements of all of these parameters.
%An STCF will contribute significantly to this goal.

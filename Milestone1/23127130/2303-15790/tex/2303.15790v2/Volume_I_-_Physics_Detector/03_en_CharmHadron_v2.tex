\section{Charmed Hadron Physics}
The discovery of the charm quark in 1974 was a great milestone in
the development of particle physics and the establishment of the
Standard Model (SM).
%A high-luminosity Super $\tau$-Charm Factory  (STCF),
The high-luminosity STCF,
which will be capable of producing approximately $10^9\sim 10^{10}$ quantum-coherent $D^0 \bar{D}^0$ meson pairs,
$D^+$ or $D^+_s$ mesons, and $\Lambda_c^+$ baryons, will be an important
low-background playground for testing the SM and probing new
physics relative to the experience at BESIII~\cite{Li:2021iwf}. In particular, it will serve as a unique tool
for determining the Cabbibo--Kobayashi--Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements
$V_{cd}$ and $V_{cs}$, measuring the $D^0$--$\bar{D}^0$ mixing
parameters, probing $CP$ violation in the charm sector, searching for
rare and forbidden charmed hadron decays, and studying other fundamental
problems associated with the charmed hadrons. Many of the golden measurements at the STCF will be dominated by systematic uncertainties; therefore, a state-of-the-art detector with excellent performance will be required, especially for identifying the different types of charged particles, detecting low-momentum charged particles and measuring photons.

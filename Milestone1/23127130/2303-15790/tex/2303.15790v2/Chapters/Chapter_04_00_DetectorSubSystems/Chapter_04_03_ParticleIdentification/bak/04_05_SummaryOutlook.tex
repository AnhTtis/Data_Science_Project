\subsection{SummaryOutlook}

The baseline technologies for the PID detector at STCF, i.e. a RICH with C6F14 radiator for the barrel and a DIRC-type FTOF detector for the endcap, have been evaluated through MC simulation. The conceptual designs are given and the expected performance are studied and optimized to meet the PID requirements at STCF. Extensive R$\&$D works are underway to verify the designs and the key technical aspects.

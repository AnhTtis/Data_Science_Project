\subsection{Summary and Outlook}

The baseline technology for the barrel PID detector at the STCF is a RICH detector with a C$_6$F$_{14}$ radiator.
The conceptual designs are described, and the expected performance is studied through MC simulation. After optimization, the RICH design is expected to meet the PID requirements at the STCF. Extensive R$\&$D works are underway to verify the designs and key technical aspects.

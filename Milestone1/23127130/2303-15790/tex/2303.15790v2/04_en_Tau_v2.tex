\section{Tau Physics}

At the STCF, as many as $3.5\times10^{9}$ $\tau^+\tau^-$ pairs can be produced per year at $\sqrt{s} = 4.26~\GeV$, which is approximately 3 orders of magnitude higher than the currently accumulated number of $\tau^+\tau^-$ events at BESIII. At the production threshold, there could be as many as $10^{8}$ $\tau^+\tau^-$ events per year. Under near-threshold conditions, data from just below the threshold can be used to understand the background to achieve better control over systematic errors compared with BESIII~\cite{YB}. In this regard, the STCF has advantages over both LHCb and Belle II for $\tau$ physics studies. In the energy range covered by the STCF, good control can also be exerted over the polarizations of the $e^+$ and $e^-$ beams to extract new information about $\tau$ physics. The STCF will tremendously increase the statistical significance for $\tau$-related physics studies and will reach a level of precision that has never been achieved before.

The $\tau$ lepton occupies a unique place in the SM. Being the heaviest charged lepton, it has many more decay channels than the next lighter charged lepton, the muon ($\mu$). With an unprecedented number of $\tau$s produced not far from the threshold and possible polarization information at the STCF, one can gain more precise knowledge of not only the properties of the $\tau$ itself but also how it interacts with other particles; thus, one can more precisely determine the SM parameters, probe possible new interactions and possibly also shed light on some of the related anomalies in particle physics. In the following, we describe some of the interesting subjects in $\tau$ physics that can be addressed at the STCF.

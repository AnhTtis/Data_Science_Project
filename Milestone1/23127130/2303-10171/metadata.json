    "abstract": "Accurately determining bubble wall velocities in first-order phase transitions is of great importance for the prediction of gravitational wave signals and the matter-antimatter asymmetry. However, it is a challenging task which typically depends on the underlying particle physics model. Recently, it has been shown that assuming local thermal equilibrium can provide a good approximation when calculating the bubble wall velocity. In this paper, we provide a model-independent determination of bubble wall velocities in local thermal equilibrium. Our results show that, under the reasonable assumption that the sound speeds in the plasma are approximately uniform, the hydrodynamics can be fully characterized by four quantities: the phase strength $α_n$, the ratio of the enthalpies in the broken and symmetric phases, $Ψ_n$, and the sound speeds in both phases, $c_s$ and $c_b$. We provide a code snippet that allows for a determination of the wall velocity and energy fraction in local thermal equilibrium in any model. In addition, we present a fit function for the wall velocity in the case $c_s = c_b = 1/\\sqrt 3$.",

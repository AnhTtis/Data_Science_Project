{
The finite temperature calculations of unbiased exponential resummation at a real, finite isospin chemical potential $\muI$ in lattice QCD do not experience the fermion sign problem. Although this suggests that the computations, in principle can be continued for all real finite values of $\muI$, however recent studies demonstrating the formation of a pion condensate in the isospin phase diagram of QCD at a finite temperature $T$ possibly imply the occurrence of a breakdown of this formalism at some finite value of $\muI$. In this paper, we present results illustrating the singularities of the partition function obtained using Newton-Raphson method in complex $\muI$ plane. We observe a naive non-monotonic behaviour of isospin number density beyond the radius of convergence which is determined by the Newton-Raphson singularity situated closest to the origin. We also introduce a new way of formulating a non-trivial phasefactor in complex $\muI$ which promises to identify reliably the onset of this breakdown along the real $\muI$ axis. We also illuminate increasing severity of the overlap problem with increasing value of physical $\muI$. We find that the relative errorbars of kurtosis as a measure of this overlap problem become significantly large, on going beyond the value of real $\muI$ from which, these phasefactor values averaged over the working gauge ensemble start becoming zero.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

\hs The strong force as one of the four fundamental forces of Nature is very well described by the quantum field theory of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)\,\cite{Gross:2022QCD}. An immensely important and intriguing spectacle in the paradigm of these strong interactions is the QCD phase diagram which features various interesting phases of strongly interacting matter. One of the important aspects of QCD is to explore and map this phase diagram\,\cite{Halasz:1998phasediagram, Rajagopal:1999phasediagram,Stephanov:2006phasediagram,Fukushima:2011phasediagram} as a function of temperature $T$ and baryochemical potential $\muB$ which is pivotal not only for knowing the strong dynamics at various energy scales, but also for illuminating the physics of early universe\,\cite{McGuigan:2008earlyuniverse,Castorina:2015earlyuniverse}. Although this phase diagram looks apparently complete and quite robust by itself, a majority of it being constructed out from mere symmetry arguments and model analyses, continue to remain conjectured and await further conclusive evidences. Because of its ability to successfully predict results to appreciable degree of precision for most of the time, one often resorts to the non-perturbative formulation of thermodynamics crafted by lattice QCD\,\cite{Davies:2005latticeQCD,Boyle:2022latticeQCD}. Besides offering possible signatures of unexplored phases, framing QCD on lattice also enables one to obtain important reliable insights about the phase diagram.  Like at present, lattice simulations can very well explain the manifestations along the vertical $T$ axis ($T \neq 0, \muB=0$) of the diagram and establish that the phase transition between the hadronic and quark-gluon plasma phases at zero $\muB$ is an analytical crossover\,\cite{Steinbrecher:2018QCDcrossover,Borsanyi:2020QCDcrossover,Bazavov:2018QCDcrossover,Li:2020QCDcrossover,Guenther:2021QCDcrossover}.


% In quest of these crucial evidences, one must embrace a  reliable non-perturbative thermodynamic approach, since the system can be explained perturbatively only at high values of $T$ and $\muB$. Out of the many non-perturbative methods being proposed, lattice QCD appears to be the most promising of all at present, mostly because of its successful prediction of results to appreciable precision. Like at present, lattice simulations of QCD can very well explain the dynamics along the vertical $T$ axis ($T \neq 0, \muB=0$) and establish that the phase transition between the hadronic and quark-gluon plasma phases at zero $\muB$ is an analytical crossover.  

However for real $\muB \neq 0$, lattice QCD faces a stiff computational hurdle in form of the infamous sign problem. At finite $\muB$, the path integral\,\cite{Palumbo:2002pathintegral} expressing the QCD partition function $Z$ becomes complex with its measure containing a complex fermion determinant\,\cite{Nakamura:2005complexfermiondeterminant} which gives rise to the problem of complex measure. This complex measure hinders implementation of Monte-Carlo important sampling to estimate this integral form of $Z$. While reweighting\,\cite{Ejiri:2004reweighting,Li:2006reweighting} this complex measure with a real fermion determinant at zero $\muB$ makes the measure real, the observable part of the integral gets complexified which, after Monte-Carlo estimation provides a phaseangle $\Theta$ and a subsequent gauge ensemble averaged phasefactor $\LA \cos \Theta \RA$. This gives rise to a sign problem\,\cite{Gupta:2004signproblem,Danzer:2009signproblem,Goy:2016signproblem,Nagata:2021signproblem}, the severity of which is governed by the magnitude of this phasefactor that reduces to zero with increasing values of $\muB$. This signifies that the sign problem becomes highly severe in the sense, that the integrand exhibits tremendous oscillations across positive and negative real values, each of which is also large in magnitude. This sign problem eventually leads to the breakdown of lattice QCD computations at a finite value of $\muB$ reflected by the non-monotonic behaviour of the calculated observables. This highly restricts our investigation and consequent knowledge of QCD at finite density. 

% This is the infamous complex measure problem which hinders implementation of Monte-Carlo important sampling for estimation of the path integral. This assumes the form of a sign problem eventually after reweighting the integrand with real fermion determinant obtained at $\muB=0$, which makes the integral measure real and re-enables application of Monte-Carlo sampling. The resulting sign problem leads to the breakdown of lattice QCD computations after a finite value of $\muB$ where the integrand becomes highly oscillating and hence cannot be effectively captured using Monte-Carlo importance sampling. This makes the finite density regime of QCD mostly unexplored, which encompass color superconducting phases and neutron stars. 

Several new methods\,\cite{Bilic:1987Langevin,Aarts:2016Langevin,Kogut:2019Langevin,Sinclair:2019Langevin,Cristoforetti:2012Thimbles,Cristoforetti:2013Thimbles,Scorzato:2015Thimbles} have been introduced which can successfully avoid this sign problem, most of which unfortunately have very limited applications in explicit QCD. For QCD, the Taylor expansion around $\muB=0$\,\cite{Ejiri:2003Taylor,Miao:2008Taylor,Falcone:2010Taylor} and analytic continuation of simulations from imaginary to real $\muB$\,\cite{DElia:2002Analytic,Lombardo:2006Analytic,Sakai:2009Analytic} continue to remain the prominent methods for circumventing the sign problem and providing state-of-the-art results for QCD equation of state\,\cite{Fodor:2002EoS,Aoki:2005EoS,Miller:2006EoS,Karsch:2008EoS,Kanaya:2010EoS,Huovinen:2011EoS,Philipsen:2012EoS,Hegde:2014EoS,Bazavov:2017EoS} at finite $\muB$. Resummation approaches like  Pad{\'e}\,\cite{Cvetic:2011Pade,Pasztor:2020Pade,Bollweg:2022Pade} and exponential resummation\,\cite{Mondal:2021exponentialresummation} have been proposed, to improve the slowly convergent Taylor series results. While the former approximates the Taylor coefficients by rational functions where one is interested to find the roots and poles of these functions, the latter provides a direct estimate of $Z$ in the form of an exponential, the argument of which comprises finite contributions of lower order Taylor series. Besides capturing these contributions to all orders in $\muB$, exponential resummation is observed to predict the singularities of $Z$ in complex $\muB$ plane and provide an estimate of radius of convergence to an appreciable extent. Despite these, it is also observed to encounter biased estimates\,\cite{Mitra:2022Bonn,Mitra:2022cumulantexpansion} which can be successfully eliminated to some finite order in $\muB$ by the recently introduced formalism of unbiased exponential resummation\,\cite{Mitra:2023unbiasedexponentialresummation}. This unbiased approach is paramount for recognising the genuine higher order Taylor contributions captured through this approach of resummation.

Unlike $\muB$, there is no sign problem in case of isospin chemical potential $\muI$ in $2+1$ flavor QCD. Although this means that in principle, one can perform unbiased exponential resummation to all real values of $\muI$ extending to $\infty$, studies suggest that there is a genuine phase diagram\,\cite{deForcrand:2007isospin,Moller:2009isospin,Brandt:2016isospin,Brandt:2017isospin,Brandt:2019isospin} in the $T-\muI$ plane which illustrates the formation of a pion condensate starting from some finite value of $\muI$ for a low $T$. This signifies that at a low $T$ surely, this formalism is supposed to have a finite radius of convergence in $\muI$ and is expected to experience a breakdown beyond that. This is because, the calculation relies on extrapolations from $\muI=0$ which remains in a non-condensed phase of the isospin phase diagram. Since the usual phasefactor values remain at unity for all $\muI$ due to no sign problem, this phasefactor unlike $\muB$, cannot locate the initiation of this breakdown. This paper aims to come up with a reliable indicator for this purpose.   

% However, both these methods in QCD remain effective only upto some small values of $\muB/T$, for which they require substantial modifications to explore and probe deeper into regimes with higher density, where one may expect to observe signatures of other interesting and exotic phases which are being proposed.

% Several modification schemes have been put forward, out of which a very important approach is resumming lower order Taylor series in QCD at finite density. Apart from Pad{\'e} resummation using the Pad{\'e} approximants\,\cite{Cvetic:2011Pade,Pasztor:2020Pade,Bollweg:2022Pade}, the method of exponential resummation\,\cite{Mondal:2021exponentialresummation} exponentiating the first few lower order Taylor coefficients to all orders in $\muB$ is another significant approach. This method approximates the partition function $Z$ with an exponential series, the argument of which comprises a finite series in $n$-point correlation functions $D_n$ coupled with appropriate powers of $\muB$. This leads to capturing contributions of $D_n$ to some finite $n$ to all orders in $\muB$ where the $D_n$ are the same correlation functions used for constructing the successive Taylor coefficients in the usual Taylor expansion of thermodynamic observables. This usual formula of exponential resummation unfortunately gets affected by the appearance of stochastically biased estimates\,\cite{Mitra:2022cumulantexpansion} of $D_n$ and therefore warrants elimination for a genuine interpretation of the QCD phase diagram. Recently, a new formalism of unbiased exponential resummation\,\cite{Mitra:2023unbiasedexponentialresummation,Mitra:2022unbiasedexponentialresummation,Mitra:2022Bonn} has been introduced which can eliminate stochastic bias upto a given order in $\muB$ and can successfully capture higher order Taylor contributions for both real and imaginary values of $\muB/T$. 

% Despite this, the results can only be obtained upto the breakdown value of $\muB$ as the sign problem continues to prevail. This sign problem can be efficiently captured by the zeroes of phasefactor results averaged over all the gauge configurations present in the working gauge ensemble and hence, one can know from this, the extent of WRITE HERE. For isospin chemical potential $\muI/T$, there is no sign problem and the phasefactor results remaining at unity, never plummet to zero. This therefore leaves us with no reliable indicators that can identify the breakdown of this unbiased exponential resummation for $\muI$. At the same time, it is certainly known that this formalism will experience a breakdown at some value of $\muI$, since there is a genuine phase transition in the form of a pion condensate in the plane of $\muI-T$. 

 
The paper is organised as follows: In \autoref{sec:Unbiased exp}, we provide a quick overview on the nomenclature of the unbiased exponential resummation formalism. The details of scale setting and setup of lattice including random volume sources and gauge configurations used in constructing the Taylor coefficients for the unbiased formalism are highlighted in \autoref{sec:setup}. In \autoref{sec:Results}, we present a comprehensive picture of the Newton-Raphson singularities of QCD partition function $Z$ and subsequent radius of convergence in the complex $\muI/T$ plane where $Z$ is evaluated as a function of $\muI$ at a finite $T$ using unbiased exponential resummation. In \autoref{sec:Phasefactor formalism}, we introduce a new prescription of a non-trivial phasefactor that can possibly capture the Newton-Raphson singularity nearest to the origin by discerning the radius of convergence. We also show that how the overlap problem becomes increasingly severe as $\muI$ is increased along the real axis of the complex $\muI$ plane, with particular interest being the rapid and striking enlargement of the subsequent errorbars across the radius of convergence, as directed by this new phasefactor. We conclude with a summary of the main results and possible scope in \autoref{sec:Conclusions}. Throughout this paper, we have used relativistic units ($\hbar = c = 1$) and unit Boltzmann constant and have denoted $\muI/T$ as simply $\muI$.           


\section{Unbiased exponential Resummation: A brief overview}
\label{sec:Unbiased exp}


\hs We present a quick discussion on unbiased exponential resummation in this section. For a detailed picture of this formalism, we refer to Ref.\,\cite{Mitra:2023unbiasedexponentialresummation}. The partition function $Z$ for a given $T,\mu$\footnote{$\mu$ denotes any arbitrary chemical potential.} is given as 

\begin{equation}
    Z(T,\mu) = \int \mathcal{D}U \heq e^{-S_G\left[T,U\right]} \heq \det \M(T,\mu,U)
    \label{eq:partition function}
\end{equation}
%
where the $\det \M(T,\mu,U)$\footnote{We have suppressed volume dependence from here on.} is given by 

\begin{equation}
\det \M(T,\mu,U) = \prod_{f=u,d,s} \big[\det \M(T,\mu_f,U)\big]^{1/4} 
\label{eq:staggered fermion}
\end{equation}
%
This equation reflects the staggered signature of the constituent fermion action within the QCD action. In Eqns.\eqref{eq:partition function} and \eqref{eq:staggered fermion}, $U$ represent the gauge field configurations and functional $S_G\left[T,U\right]$ denotes the gluon action. The usual exponential resummation formulae of number density $\mathcal{N}$ and excess pressure defined as $\Delta P(T,\mu) = P(T,\mu)-P(T,0)$ for a thermodynamic system of volume $V$ at temperature $T$ are given as follows:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\Delta P(T,\mu)}{T^4} = \frac{1}{VT^3} \, \ln \left[\text{Re}\LA \exp \left(\nsum_{n=1}^N \left(\frac{\mu}{T}\right)^n \frac{\overline{D_n}}{n!}\right) \RA \right], \hspace{4mm} \frac{\mathcal{N}}{T^3} = \frac{\partial}{\partial (\mu/T)} \left[\frac{\Delta P}{T^4}\right]
    \label{eq:expoential resum}
\end{equation}
%
In Eqn.\,\eqref{eq:expoential resum}, the excess pressure and number density are scaled with appropriate powers of $T$ to make them dimensionless. The $D_n$ are the usual temperature dependent $n$-point correlation functions given as 

\begin{equation}
    D_n(T,U) = \frac{\partial^n \ln \det \M(T,\mu,U)}{\partial (\mu/T)^n}\bigg|_{\mu=0}
    \label{eq:derivatives}
\end{equation}
%
$\LA \Ob \RA$ represent the average of arbitrary observable $\Ob$ over all gauge field configurations comprising the working gauge ensemble, which is given by 

\begin{equation*}
    \Big \langle \Ob(T,\mu) \Big \rangle = \frac{1}{Z} \int \mathcal{D}U \heq e^{-S_G\left[T,U\right]} \heq \Ob(T,\mu,U) \heq \det \M(T,\mu,U)
\end{equation*}
%
where $Z$ is given in Eqn.\,\eqref{eq:partition function}. The $\overline{D_n}$ in Eqn.\,\eqref{eq:expoential resum} is the average of $D_n$ calculated over all the available Gaussian random volume sources $N_R$ present within a given gauge configuration given as:

\begin{equation}
    \overline{D_n} = \frac{1}{N_R} \nsum_{r=1}^{N_R} D_n^{(r)}
    \label{eq:random volume sources}
\end{equation}
%
This is because the fermion matrix $\M$ cannot be calculated exactly using analytical means\,\cite{Ying:1998fermionmatrix}. We have seen how biased estimates appear in the formula of usual exponential resummation due to Eqn.\,\eqref{eq:random volume sources}. The unbiased exponential resummation retains the original form of exponential resummation with the exception that the argument of the exponential is modified accordingly so that it produces unbiased estimates of $D_n$ to a given order in $\mu$, where $\mu$ is any arbitrary chemical potential. Typically, in our calculations we have considered $\mu \in (B,S,I)$ basis where the symbols have the usual meanings. This formalism is performed in two bases namely,

\subsection{Chemical potential basis}

\hs In chemical potential basis, the unbiased exponential resummation resembles:
        \begin{align}   %  6
     &\frac{\Delta P_{N}^{R(\text{unb})}(T,\mu)}{T^4} = \frac{1}{VT^3} \hspace{1mm}\ln \hspace{1mm} Z_{N}^{R(\text{unb})}(T,\mu) , \notag \\ 
     &Z_{N}^{R(\text{unb})}(T,\mu) = \text{Re} \left \langle \bigg[\exp \Big(A_N\left(T,\mu\right)\Big)\bigg] \right \rangle , \notag \\
    &A_N\left(T,\mu\right) = \nsum_{n=1}^{N} \left(\frac{\mu}{T}\right)^n\,\frac{\mathcal{C}_{n}}{n!} 
     \label{eq:mu basis}
      \end{align}  %  6
      %\\[0.2cm]
      where the first four $\mathcal{C}_n$ are given as follows:

%&\hspace{3mm}
 
 %\begin{widetext}
\begin{align}
    &\mathcal{C}_1 = \overline{D_1}, \notag \\
    &\mathcal{C}_2 = \overline{D_2} + \left[\overline{(D_1)^2} - \overline{(D_1)}^2\right], \notag \\
    &\mathcal{C}_3 = \overline{D_3} + 3\left(\overline{D_2 D_1} - \overline{D_2}\;\overline{D_1}\right) + 
           \left(\overline{D_1^3} - 3\,\overline{(D_1)^2}\;\overline{D_1} + 2\,\left(\overline{D_1}\right)^3\right), \notag \\
    &\mathcal{C}_4 = \overline{D_4} + 3\left(\overline{(D_2)^2} - \left(\overline{D_2}\right)^2\right)+ 4\left(\overline{D_3 D_1} - \overline{D_3}\;\overline{D_1}\right) + 6\left( \overline{D_2 (D_1)^2} - \overline{D_2}\;\overline{(D_1)^2}\right)  \notag \\
    &- 12 \left(\overline{D_2 D_1}\;\overline{D_1} - \overline{D_2}\left(\overline{D_1}\right)^2\right) +
     \Big(\overline{(D_1)^4} - 4\,\,\overline{(D_1)^3}\;\overline{D_1} + 12\,\overline{(D_1)^2}\left(\overline{D_1}\right)^2 \notag \\
     &\hspace{6cm}- 6\left(\overline{D_1}\right)^4 - 3\,(\overline{(D_1)^2})^2\Big)
\label{eq:mu coefficients}
\end{align}
%
 Here in Eqn.\,\eqref{eq:mu coefficients}, $\overline{D_n^p}$ indicates average of $p^{th}$ unbiased power of $D_n$ over all the $N_{R}$ random volume sources contained within a given gauge field configuration. Eqn.\,\eqref{eq:mu basis} along with Eqn.\,\eqref{eq:mu coefficients} eliminates stochastic bias upto $\Ob(\mu^4)$.

\subsection{Cumulant basis}

\hs In cumulant basis with $X_N = \sum_{n=1}^N \left(\frac{\mu}{T}\right)^n \frac{D_n}{n!}$,  this formalism looks as follows:

 \begin{align}   %  6
     &\frac{\Delta P_{N,M}^{R(\text{unb})}(T,\mu)}{T^4} = \frac{1}{VT^3} \hspace{1mm}\ln \hspace{1mm} Z_{N,M}^{R(\text{unb})}(T,\mu) , \notag \\ 
     &Z_{N,M}^{R(\text{unb})}(T,\mu) = \text{Re} \LA \bigg[\exp \Big(W_M\big[X_N\left(T,\mu\right)\big]\Big)\bigg] \RA , \notag \\
     &W_M\big[X_N\left(T,\mu\right)\big] = \nsum_{m=1}^{M} \frac{\mathcal{L}_{m}\left(X_N\right)}{m!}
      \label{eq:cumulant basis}
      \end{align}
%
where $\L_m$ for $1 \leq m \leq 4$ are as follows:

\begin{align}
   \L_1 &= \overline{X_N}, \notag \\
   \L_2 &= \overline{(X_N)^2} - \big(\overline{X_N}\big)^2, \notag \\
   \L_3 &= \overline{(X_N)^3} - 3\,\big(\overline{X_N}\big)\;\overline{(X_N)^2} + 2\,\big(\overline{X_N}\big)^3, \notag \\
   \L_4 &= \overline{(X_N)^4}- 4\,\overline{(X_N)^3}\;\big(\overline{X_N}\big)  
         + 12\,\big(\overline{X_N}\big)^2\;\overline{(X_N)^2} - 6\,\big(\overline{X_N}\big)^4- 3\,\big(\overline{(X_N)^2}\big)^2
\label{eq:cumulant L}
\end{align}
%
Implementing the formalism in this basis following Eqn.\,\eqref{eq:cumulant basis}, using the expressions of Eqn.\,\eqref{eq:cumulant L} leads to reproducing the first $4$ cumulants exactly of unbiased cumulant expansion, where the cumulants are expressed in terms of unbiased powers. We observed that this formalism not only eliminates stochastic bias upto a finite order in $\mu$, it can also capture higher order Taylor contributions successfully. On adding more number of $\L_n$ or $\mathcal{C}_n$, one makes approach towards exponential resummation unbiased to all orders in $\mu$ which, in infinite limit becomes identical to the infinite Taylor series in $\mu$.  


\section{Setup of the calculations}
\label{sec:setup}

\hs In this work, we have extensively used the data generated by the HotQCD collaboration for its ongoing Taylor expansion calculations. In this section, we discuss the setup and other important relevant details of this data. 

With a $2+1$ flavor signature, the QCD action considered for generating the data for these calculations consists of a Symanzik-improved gauge action\,\cite{Symanzik:1983gauge,Symanzik:1983gauge2nd}
and the Highly Improved Staggered Quark (HISQ) fermion action\,\cite{Gabrielli:1990Improvement,MILC:2008HISQ,MILC:2010HISQ}. Gauge field configurations of the order $\Ob(10^4$ - $10^6)$ are generated in the temperature range $135$~MeV~$\lesssim~T~\lesssim$~$176$~MeV with $\Nt=8$, $12$ and $16$ and $\Ns=4\Nt$\footnote{$\Ns$ and $\Nt$ are the number of points in each of the three spatial directions and temporal direction respectively for $\Ns^3 \cdot \Nt$ lattice.}. The lattices considered are isotropic with lattice spacing $a=a_{\sigma}=a_{\tau}$\footnote{$a_{\sigma}$ and $a_{\tau}$ are the lattice spacings along each of the spatial and temporal directions of the lattice.}. Our work is performed using an isotropic lattice of size $32^3 \cdot 8$ in Euclidean four spacetime, which is Wick rotated from the usual $3+1$ relativistic Minkowski spacetime. Following the relation $T=(a\Nt)^{-1}$, the temperature for each $\Nt$ is varied by varying the lattice spacing $a$ through the inverse gauge coupling $\beta$ where $\beta=6/g^2$ and $g$ is the QCD coupling parameter. For each $a$ the bare light and strange quark masses $m_l(a)$ and $m_s(a)$ are also tuned so that the pseudo-Goldstone pion and kaon masses produced become equal to the physical pion ($\pi$) and kaon ($K$) masses respectively. This fixes the line of constant physics for the lattice setup under consideration. The scale setting is determined using both the Sommer parameter $r_1$ and the kaon decay constant $f_K$. A complete description of the gauge ensembles and scale setting is provided in Ref.~\,\cite{Bollweg:2021vqf}.
To calculate the Taylor coefficients for unbiased exponential resummation, on each gauge configuration the correlation functions $D_1^u,\dots,D_4^u$ for up quark are estimated stochastically using $500$ Gaussian volume sources. The mass degeneracy between up and down quarks in $2+1$ flavor nomenclature ensures that these correlation functions have the same value for down quarks, namely $D_1^d,\dots,D_4^d$ for each of these $500$ random sources. Using these correlation functions and consequent basis transformation illustrated in \autoref{sec:appendix}, the isospin correlation functions $D_1^I,\dots,D_4^I$ are calculated for these random sources. The exponential-$\mu$ formalism is used to calculate these four derivatives (see Eqn.\,\eqref{eq:derivatives})\footnote{The higher derivatives $D_n$ for $n>4$ are calculated using the linear-$\mu$ formalism.}. Using this data, we have calculated the isospin number density for real isospin chemical potentials $\muI$, in the range $0 \leqslant \lvert \mu_{I}/T \rvert \leqslant 2.5$, using $20K$ configurations per temperature. Our results have been obtained on $\Nt=8$ lattices for three temperatures namely at $T \sim 135$, $157$ and $176$ MeV. Besides lying in the hadronic, crossover and QGP phases of the QCD phase diagram, these temperatures have been chosen as being approximately equal to $\Tpc$ and $\Tpc\pm20$~MeV, where $\Tpc=156.5(1.5)$~MeV is the chiral crossover temperature at zero baryon chemical potential $\muB$ for physical values of bare quark masses.  For the determination of phasefactor at the nearest Newton-Raphson singularity in the complex $\muI$ plane, we have considered taking $100$ bootstrap samples of the working gauge configuration ensemble. Each of these bootstrapped samples comprises $20K$ configurations which may have repetition due to randomisation of the chosen random number generator in the bootstrap algorithm. 
 
% The Newton-Raphson method has been illustrated briefly in the next section and the singularities have been plotted without the errorbars, because they appear as a sizeable chunk in the region of the complex $\muI$ plane considered. This is the same during the evaluation of the phasefactor values for different values of complex $\muI$.


\section{Results: Newton-Raphson singularities of partition function}
\label{sec:Results}

\hs In this section, we present our results for the singularities of partition function $Z$ and also illustrate the behaviour of number density $\N$ as a function of $\muI$ across the radius of convergence. The partition function is estimated using the formalism of unbiased exponential resummation to $2^{nd}$ and $4^{th}$ orders in both cumulant and chemical potential bases respectively. The singularities of this partition function are obtained using the Newton-Raphson method and the distance of the nearest Newton-Raphson singularity as obtained, from the origin \{$\text{Re}\left(\muI\right)=\text{Im}\left(\muI\right)=0$\} in the complex $\muI$ plane determines the radius of convergence\footnote{Given that one of the Newton-Raphson singularities is a complex $\muI$ which is $\muI=\muI^R+i\,\muI^I$, its radial distance from origin is given by $|\muI| = \sqrt{(\muI^R)^2 + (\muI^I)^2}$. The radius of convergence is the least of all such radial distances corresponding to all such singularities.}\,$\rho$. It is crucial to determine these singularities because the free energy $\sim \ln Z$ diverges at these singularity values of complex $\muI$. Consequently, all the thermodynamic observables being some finite order $\muI$ derivative of free energy will exhibit divergent and ll-defined  behaviour at these values of $\muI$. All these results of singularities of $Z$ for three temperatures, namely $135$, $157$ and $176$ MeV have been demonstrated in Fig.\,\ref{fig:135_sing_and_num_den},  \ref{fig:157_sing_and_num_den} and \ref{fig:176_sing_and_num_den} respectively.



 The Newton-Raphson method having a quadratic rate of convergence has been implemented in this work for determining singularities of $Z$ using a maximum of $\Ob(10^6)$ iterations. Although the perturbed iterative algorithm\,\cite{Dey:1979PIS} provides faster converging results over the Newton-Raphson method, implementing this algorithm here will require one to evaluate exponential of $Z$ which produces an astronomically large number. Consequently, the computations following this algorithm becomes highly unsuitable and unstable. Hence despite its limitations in the form of calculating a non-singular derivative of $Z$, the Newton-Raphson method is preferred here as one only needs to provide the partition function $Z$ and its first $\muI$ derivative for a given value of $\muI$. The naive formula of this method for our work resembles

 \begin{equation}
    \muI^{\left[n+1\right]} = \muI^{\left[n\right]} - \frac{Z\left(\muI^{\left[n\right]}\right)}{Z^{'}\left(\muI^{\left[n\right]}\right)} \hspace{.3cm},\hspace{.7cm} \epsilon = \left|\muI^{\left[n+1\right]} - \muI^{\left[n\right]}\right|
    \label{eq:Newton-Raphson}
\end{equation}
 %
 where $n \geq 0$ is an integer, bearing the label of $n^{th}$ iteration. This method initiates from a random guess of $\muI$ value as a root of $Z$, given by $\muI^{\left[0\right]}$ in the above Eqn.\,\eqref{eq:Newton-Raphson} and subsequently, one keeps performing iterative evaluations of roots till it surpasses the maximum number of allowed iterations or until the magnitude of the difference $\epsilon$ in Eqn.\,\eqref{eq:Newton-Raphson} drops below a given value. In our work, $\epsilon = 0.002$. The initial guesses of $\muI$ i.e. $\muI^{\left[0\right]}$ have been constructed from $0 \leq \text{Re}\left(\muI\right) \leq 3$, $0 \leq \text{Im}\left(\muI\right) \leq 3$ in the steps of $0.1$ between successive guesses along each of the real and imaginary axes in the complex plane of $\muI$. In both the left column plots of Fig.\,\ref{fig:135_sing_and_num_den}, \ref{fig:157_sing_and_num_den} and \ref{fig:176_sing_and_num_den}, the blue points indicate the Newton-Raphson singularities of partition function $Z$ in cumulant basis, whereas the red points represent the same in chemical potential basis. Correspondingly, the radius of convergence $\rho$ in the respective bases are  represented by the blue and red circles respectively. The plots in the right column exhibit the behaviour of isospin number density across the radius of convergence as given by these Newton-Raphson singularities. The top row plots correspond to $2^{nd}$ order whereas the bottom row plots present the $4^{th}$ order results. Following \autoref{sec:Unbiased exp}, $\rho_{N.M}^{R(\text{unb})}$ denotes the radius of convergence in cumulant basis whereas $\rho_N^{R(\text{unb})}$ represents the same in chemical potential basis.
 % We find that the number of roots in the $2^{nd}$ order results are far less than the same for $4^{th}$ order within $0 \leq \text{Re}(\muI) \leq 2$, $0 \leq \text{Im}(\muI) \leq 2$. This is due to the decreasing value of the ratio of $Z$ and $Z^{'}$ in $4^{th}$ order as compared to the $2^{nd}$ order calculations. The denominator $Z^{'}$ of this ratio in Eqn.\,\eqref{eq:Newton-Raphson} which is the $\muI$ derivative of $Z$, comprises non-exponentiated $2$-point and $4$-point isospin correlation functions $D_2^I$ and $D_4^I$ along with other unbiased powers in the $4^{th}$ order, apart from the usual exponential form of the unbiased resummation. The larger values of $D_4^I$ over $D_2^I$ configuration by configuration coupled with higher powers of $\muI$ cause this denominator significantly larger in $4^{th}$ order over $2^{nd}$ order, which leads to smaller values of the ratio and more crowding of the final roots in this regime One also observes much more number of roots at $157$ and $176$ MeV for both $2^{nd}$ and $4^{th}$ order calculations over the same obtained at $T=135$ MeV. This occurs because the values of the temperature dependent $D_n^I$ increases with temperature, as a result of which the ratio between the $Z$ and its $\muI$ derivative decreases with temperature. This causes the successive root approximations to converge and stabilise fast, resulting to more number of roots within the same region of complex $\muI$ plane.

We find that the number of roots in the $2^{nd}$ order results are far less than the same for $4^{th}$ order within $0 \leq \text{Re}(\muI) \leq 2$, $0 \leq \text{Im}(\muI) \leq 2$ for all the three temperatures. This is due to the decreasing value of the ratio of $Z$ and $Z^{'}$ in $4^{th}$ order as compared to the $2^{nd}$ order calculations. The denominator $Z^{'}$ of this ratio in Eqn.\,\eqref{eq:Newton-Raphson} being the first order $\muI$ derivative of $Z$, comprises non-exponentiated isospin correlation functions $D_2^I$ and $D_4^I$ along with other unbiased powers and usual exponential form of the unbiased resummation in $4^{th}$ order. The larger values of $D_4^I$ over $D_2^I$ for every configuration coupled with higher powers of $\muI$ cause this denominator significantly larger in $4^{th}$ order over $2^{nd}$ order evaluations, which leads to smaller values of the ratio and more crowding of the roots in this region of complex $\muI$ plane, to which this method finally converges to. One also observes the number of roots at $157$ and $176$ MeV for both $2^{nd}$ and $4^{th}$ order calculations is much more within the same part of the complex $\muI$ plane than $T=135$ MeV. This occurs because the values of the temperature dependent $D_n^I$ increases with temperature, as a result of which the ratio between the $Z$ and its $\muI$ derivative decreases with temperature. This causes the successive root approximations to converge and stabilise fast, resulting to more number of roots within the same region of complex $\muI$ plane.


We observe that the crowding of the roots begins from $\text{Re}(\muI) \sim 1.7$, $\text{Im}(\muI) \sim 0.7$ for $T=135$ MeV in Fig.\,\ref{fig:135_sing_and_num_den}. This is because, the values of $Z$ and $Z^{'}$ in Eqn.\,\eqref{eq:Newton-Raphson} become larger with increasing values of complex $\muI$. As a result, the Newton-Raphson method fails to converge properly to actual roots.
More importantly, the degree of convergence of this method becomes worse with higher values of complex $\muI$, due to which these values when considered as initial guesses for the Newton-Raphson method, often get manifested as the Newton-Raphson roots in the figures. This strongly illustrates poor convergent properties of this method for these values of complex $\muI$. It is for this very reason, which leads to large number of roots forming a rectangular grid-like structure in this part of the complex $\muI$ plane at $135$ MeV.

The same starts appearing at a lower value of the radial distance from origin for $157$ and $176$ MeV around $\text{Re}(\muI) = 1.5$, $\text{Im}(\muI) = 0.5$ in Figs.\,\ref{fig:157_sing_and_num_den} and \ref{fig:176_sing_and_num_den} respectively. This is because the isospin correlation functions $D_n^I$ for $n=2,4$ increases with increasing values of $T$, which consequently leads to larger values of $Z$ and $Z^{'}$ for smaller values of complex $\muI$. As a result, due to the aforementioned poor convergence of Newton-Raphson method, the grid-like crowding of Newton-Raphson roots start forming from these smaller values of complex $\muI$ for these higher temperatures. One can also suggest that the initial guesses in this part of complex $\muI$ plane are far off from the actual roots due to which, the Newton-Raphson method becomes inefficient. Despite recent efforts\,\cite{Dey:1979PIS} for improved algorithms, this disadvantage of Newton-Raphson approach will affect the entire anatomy of singularities in the complex $\muI$ plane and will hardly alter the position(s) of singularity(ies) lying closest to the origin of the complex $\muI$ plane, which are instrumental in determining the value of the radius of convergence $\rho$. The increasing differences observed between $\rho_{N,4}^{R(\text{unb})}$ and $\rho_N^{R(\text{unb})}$ for $N=2,4$ with higher values of $T$ also signify that these $D_n^I$ for $n=2,4$ increase as $T$ increases. They also try to emphasise that the excess number of higher-order terms obtained in cumulant basis in addition to the terms in chemical potential basis are making significant contributions in final results.

The isospin number density plots have been presented beside the plots of Newton-Raphson singularities. This is done for observing the changing behaviour of the observable if any, across the radius of convergence which is represented by the semicircular red and blue lines similar to the adjacent plots of Newton-Raphson singularities. Although small, there are differences clearly between the monotonicity of number density across the radius of convergence $\rho$. However, this non-monotonicity manifests in different forms. Fig.\,\ref{fig:135_sing_and_num_den} shows that the errorbars in the $4^{th}$ order calculations highly increase for both the bases and the behaviour becomes non-monotonic since the curve attains a local maximum as $\muI \geq \rho$. In the $2^{nd}$ order at the same temperature, there is a flattening of the number density curve which is clearly supposed to increase more and to higher values of number density, if extrapolated beyond the radius of convergence. Although there is hardly any noticeable change in number density at $157$ MeV, the $2^{nd}$ order evaluations at $T=176$ MeV show increasing differences between the results obtained from cumulant and chemical potential bases respectively, as one goes beyond $\rho_2^{R(\text{unb})}$. We also observe a small, yet noticeable change in the monotonicity for $4^{th}$ order calculations at this temperature. It still remains to be seen in this regard, that which observable can reflect a reasonable non-monotonicity across the radius of convergence at the crossover temperature $T=157$ MeV. As mentioned before, all these calculations are performed using unbiased exponential resummation at finite $\muI$, so that stochastic bias up to $2^{nd}$ and $4^{th}$ order are eliminated. This is done in order to ensure that the following results reflect genuine indications of the phase diagram, as much as possible.  

%We already have argued that the difference between these radii of convergence of the respective cumulant and chemical potential bases increase with increasing $T$, for a given order of calculations.

\section{A new way of identifying singularities through phasefactor}
\label{sec:Phasefactor formalism}

\subsection{Formalism}

\hs In $2+1$ flavor QCD since the $u$ and $d$ quarks are mass degenerate, the odd isospin derivatives are identically zero, following which there is no sign problem in $\muI$. This is clearly described in \autoref{sec:appendix}. The abscence of sign problem also becomes apparent from  the phaseangle $\Theta_N(T,\mu)$ in the two bases which to $\Ob(\mu^N)$ are given by

\begin{align}
    &\Theta_N^{\text{R(unb)}}(T,\muI^C) = \text{Im}\left[\nsum_{n=1}^N \left(\frac{\muI^C}{T}\right)^n \frac{\mathcal{C}_n}{n!}\right] \notag \\
    &\Theta_{N,M}^{\text{R(unb)}}(T,\muI^C) = \text{Im}\left[\nsum_{m=1}^M \frac{\L_m(X_N(T,\muI^C))}{m!}\right]
    \label{eq:unbiased phasefactor}
\end{align}
%
where $\mathcal{C}_n$ for $1 \leq n \leq 4$ are given in Eqn.\,\eqref{eq:mu coefficients} and so are $\L_m$ from $m=1$ to $m=4$ in Eqn.\,\eqref{eq:cumulant L}. In Eqn.\,\eqref{eq:unbiased phasefactor}, the $X_N(T,\muI^C)$ are defined as 

\begin{equation*}
    X_N(T,\muI^C) = \nsum_{n=1}^N \left(\frac{\muI^C}{T}\right)^n \frac{D_n^I}{n!}
\end{equation*}
%
Since odd ordered $D_n^I$ vanishes and even ordered non-vanishing $D_n^I$ are real following the CP symmetry of QCD, the phaseangle $\Theta$ becomes zero following Eqn.\,\eqref{eq:unbiased phasefactor}. Consequently, the phasefactor $ \cos \Theta$ assumes unity for every gauge configuration at finite $\muI$. Hence, although in principle, the lattice QCD calculations do not experience a genuine breakdown due to sign problem and can be continued for all finite values of $\muI$, this phasefactor information does not appear reliable and hence cannot be utilised for capturing the singularities. This is very much unlike $\muB$ or similar type of chemical potentials like $\mu_S$, $\mu_Q$ which otherwise suffer from a sign problem and in which, this problem can be located by the zeroes of this phasefactor $\LA \cos \Theta \RA$ averaged out over the working gauge ensemble. 

Similar to this notion of phasefactor, we propose formulating a non-trivial phasefactor in $\muI$ with the aim of capturing the radius of convergence, set by the closest Newton-Raphson singularity. This phasefactor is introduced by complexifying $\muI$. Given that the phasefactor is an already proven reliable indicator of the sign problem, it will be interesting to observe if this phasefactor at a complex $\muI$ can furnish genuine indications about the manifestation of the singularities and eventually the radius of convergence. At complex $\muI$, the reweighting factor becomes complex which therefore would yield a non-trivial phasefactor, which is expected to differ for different values of complex $\muI$. For a given complex $\muI = \muI^R + i\,\muI^I$, the phaseangle in the chemical potential basis for second and fourth order calculations are given as follows:

\begin{align}
    \Theta_2(T,\muI^R,\muI^I) &= \muI^R \muI^I \, \mathcal{C}_2 \label{eq:2nd order}\\
    \Theta_4(T,\muI^R,\muI^I) &= \muI^R \muI^I \left[\mathcal{C}_2 + 4\left(\left(\muI^R\right)^2 - \left(\muI^I\right)^2\right) \mathcal{C}_4 \right] \label{eq:4th order}
\end{align}
%
Eqn.\,\eqref{eq:2nd order} implies that the phaseangle $\Theta_2$ remains invariant as $(\muI^R, \muI^I) \rightarrow (\muI^I, \muI^R)$, and so will be the corresponding phasefactor. This proves that there are multiple values of complex $\muI$ which can harness the same phaseangle and subsequent phasefactor. Hence, we plot this average phasefactor as a function of the radial distance from origin in the next section. This proves to be beneficial not only by reducing this multiplicity of phasefactor, but also by helping to understand its ability of capturing the radius of convergence in a better and more convenient way.
% A complex $\muI$ can be written as $\muI^C = \muI^R + i\,\muI^I$ where $\muI^R = \text{Re}(\muI^C)$ and $\muI^I = \text{Im}(\muI^C)$. The radius of convergence $\rho_I$ is defined as 

% \begin{equation}
% \rho_I = |\muI^C| = \sqrt{\left(\muI^R\right)^2 + \left(\muI^I\right)^2}    
% \label{eq:radius}
% \end{equation}
% %
%   Following Eqn.\,\eqref{eq:expoential resum}, the phaseangle $\Theta_N(T,\muI^C)$ to $\Ob\left[(\muI^C)^N\right]$ can be defined as  

%  \begin{equation}
%  \Theta_N(T,\muI^C) = \text{Im}\left[\nsum_{n=1}^N \left(\frac{\muI^C}{T}\right)^n \frac{D_n^I}{n!}\right]
%  \end{equation}
%  %
% where $D_n^I$ are the $n$-point isospin correlation functions, which we know evaluates to zero for all odd $n$. 
% In the case of unbiased exponential resummation, this phasefactor in the respective chemical potential (see Eqn.\,\eqref{eq:mu basis}) and cumulant (see Eqn.\,\eqref{eq:cumulant basis}) bases translates to as follows:

% \begin{align}
%     &\Theta_N^{\text{R(unb)}}(T,\muI^C) = \text{Im}\left[\nsum_{n=1}^N \left(\frac{\muI^C}{T}\right)^n \frac{\mathcal{C}_n}{n!}\right] \notag \\
%     &\Theta_{N,M}^{\text{R(unb)}}(T,\muI^C) = \text{Im}\left[\nsum_{m=1}^M \frac{\L_m(X_N(T,\muI^C))}{m!}\right]
%     \label{eq:unbiased phasefactor complex}
% \end{align}
% %
% where $\mathcal{C}_n$ for $1 \leq n \leq 4$ are given in Eqn.\,\eqref{eq:mu coefficients} and so are $\L_m$ from $m=1$ to $m=4$ in Eqn.\,\eqref{eq:cumulant L}. In Eqn.\,\eqref{eq:unbiased phasefactor complex}, the $X_N(T,\muI^C)$ are defined as 

% \begin{equation*}
%     X_N(T,\muI^C) = \nsum_{n=1}^N \left(\frac{\muI^C}{T}\right)^n \frac{D_n^I}{n!}
% \end{equation*}
% \vspace{.5cm}

\subsection{Results}

\hs We present the results of $2^{nd}$ and $4^{th}$ order average phasefactor $\LA \cos \Theta \RA$ as a function of the radial distance $\rho_I$ for $T=135$, $157$ and $176$ MeV in Figs.\ref{fig:135_phasefac}, \ref{fig:157_phasefac} and \ref{fig:176_phasefac} respectively. The definition and explicit determination of radial distance of a singularity point in complex $\muI$ plane has already been illuminated in \autoref{sec:Results}. We have also captured the nearest Newton Raphson singularity along with the measurement of the average phasefactor at the singularity. This is because, we are interested in capturing the onset of these singularities of $Z$ in the complex $\muI$ plane rather than ascertaining the exact coordinates of singularities in the complex plane. This is expected to offer a proper idea about the regime of reliability and also the starting point of breakdown of unbiased exponential resummation in $\muI$. Once this breakdown starts, it is expected to continue for all values of $\muI$ lying beyond this breakdown value. This imply that this formalism hence, needs to be modified for further searches and also to extend the radius of convergence or its domain of application in complex $\muI$ plane, where it can offer reliable genuine results. In all these figures for all the temperatures, the orange points represent the average phasefactor values in cumulant and chemical potential bases respectively with the black vertical line signifies the Newton-Raphson radius of convergence $\rho_I^{\text{NR}}$. The red line indicates the critical value $\rho_I^0$ of the radial distance from origin in the complex $\muI$ plane, from which there is a continuous trail of the $\LA \cos \Theta \RA$ points condensing to zero. The phasefactor results have been obtained using $0 \leq \muI^R \leq 3$, $0 \leq \muI^I \leq 3$ in steps of $0.1$, so that in units of the radial distance, we plot phasefactor values in the range $0 \leq \rho_I \leq 3\,\sqrt{2} \approx 4.25$. 
%We also define a quantity $\diff = \rho_I^{\text{NR}} - \rho_I^0$, the magnitude of which measures the separation between the two vertical lines and and the sign of which determines the relative position of the lines with respect to the vertical $Y$ axis.

(Bottom row) The same is done for $4^{th}$ order average phasefactor.

The blue line shows the zero line of phasefactor i.e. $\LA \cos\,\Theta \RA=0$.  \label{fig:135_phasefac}}
\end{figure}

In plotting as a function of the radial distance, there is a two-fold degeneracy of the $2^{nd}$ order phasefactor values in chemical potential basis, in Eqn.\,\eqref{eq:2nd order}. This is because this distance remains invariant under the transformation $(\muI^R, \muI^I) \Rightarrow (\muI^I, \muI^R)$ and hence for every value of the radius, one finds at least two distinct values of this phasefactor. 
 At $135$ MeV as revealed in Fig.\,\ref{fig:135_phasefac}, we find the red line lies left to the black line, where the former is determined from the phasefactor values and latter from the nearest Newton-Raphson singularity. All the plots of Fig.\,\ref{fig:135_phasefac} show that $\diff$\footnote{$\diff$ is defined as $\diff = \rho_I^{\text{NR}} - \rho_I^0$} satisfies $0 < \diff \lesssim 0.2$. This demonstrates that the zeroes of phasefactor efficiently capture all the possible Newton-Raphson singularities at this temperature, since majority of the phasefactor values saturate to a continuous zero before the onset of the radius of convergence $\rho_I^{\text{NR}}$. This is emphasised by the positive sign of $\diff$, which means that this phasefactor successfully puts a bound and can save unbiased exponential resummation from running into the regime of Newton-Raphson singularities and breaking down eventually. We also find that the red and black lines are not positioned drastically apart from each other for calculations in both the bases and for both the orders. We also readily observe that the value of the phasefactor obtained at the nearest Newton-Raphson singularity lying on the circle of convergence given by the black line, is very close to zero with reasonable errorbars. This bodes well with the usual expectation of having highly oscillating phasefactor values when one approaches these Newton-Raphson singularities of partition function $Z$.

 Compared to $135$ MeV, at the crossover temperature $157$ MeV the degree of capture is more precise for $4^{th}$ order calculations over the $2^{nd}$ order, which is quantified by the positive lower magnitude of $\diff$. This is true in both the cumulant and chemical potential bases as shown in Fig.\,\ref{fig:157_phasefac}, despite the former capturing more number of higher order contribution terms over the latter. In the $2^{nd}$ order computations, the value of $\diff$ is around $0.2$ in cumulant basis, which reduces even further while considering chemical potential basis, with no alteration in the sign. Although the lowering magnitude of $\Delta_I(NR,0)$ may be attributed to the less number of terms present in the chemical potential basis, the positive sign continues to indicate that the upper bound of reliability in the scale pf $\rho_I$ starting from $\rho_I=0$ is imposed by the zeroes of this newly defined phasefactor rather than the nearest Newton-Raphson singularity; the former continues to encapsulate the latter also in the crossover region of the QCD phase diagram. The agreement and the accuracy of this capture is very appreciable for the $4^{th}$ order calculations where the two lines seem to merge with each other signifying $\diff \rightarrow 0^{+}$\footnote{The $+$ sign indicates that the value goes to zero from the positive side of zero in the real number line.}.

As for $T=176$ MeV, we observe that in Fig.\,\ref{fig:176_phasefac} the $2^{nd}$ order result in cumulant basis exhibit commendable degree of precision in capturing the Newton-Raphson singularity from the zeroes of phasefactor. We find that this phasefactor however fails to capture the singularity for the $4^{th}$ order results as well as the $2^{nd}$ order results in chemical potential basis at $176$ MeV, which can be quantified by the negative sign of $\diff$. This behaviour may be attributed to the flattening of the pion condensate curve for higher values of $T$ in the isospin phase diagram of QCD. We also find that the phasefactor value at the singularity in $4^{th}$ order computations in cumulant basis is significantly lower than the zero (blue) line as compared to the other temperatures at $135$ and $157$ MeV. The correlation functions $D_n^I$ increase with increasing temperature and at $176$ MeV, is the highest among all these three temperatures. This may highlight the importance and need to incorporate even higher order contributions in $\muI$ in chemical potential basis or, more number of cumulants in the cumulant basis of unbiased exponential resummation. Despite this failure, we make an interesting observation which may enlighten the utility of this phasefactor at $176$ MeV in the next section. We investigate overlap problem in the next section and observe how it becomes severe across the radius of convergence $\rho_I^{\text{NR}}$ and also across the critical radial value $\rho_I^0$. 


\subsection{Severity of overlap problem and kurtosis}

\hs As mentioned before, the lattice QCD computations for finite isospin chemical potential $\muI$ does not suffer from a sign problem. As a result, it is important to investigate the overlap problem, which may be one of the many possible reasons for the breakdown of unbiased exponential resummation starting from some threshold value of finite $\muI$ along the real $\muI$ axis. 
This problem arises when the distribution or sample comprising values of the ratio of fermion determinants i.e. $\frac{\det \M(\muI)}{det \M(0)}$ becomes heavily tailed which causes Monte-Carlo importance sampling ineffective. One comes across this ratio while reweighting the integrand of the path integral formulation of $Z$ in Eqn.\,\eqref{eq:partition function}. Being a function of individual gauge configurations, every gauge configuration in the ensemble yields a value of this ratio. In the light of exponential resummation, this ratio for a gauge configuration $U$ can be cast in an exponential form as follows:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\det \M(\muI,U)}{\det \M(0,U)} = \exp{\left[\nsum_{n=1}^{\infty} \muI^n \frac{D_n^I(U)}{n!}\right]}, \hs D_n^I(U) = \frac{\partial^n }{\partial \muI^n}\ln \det \M(\muI,U)\bigg|_{\muI=0}
    \label{eq:reweighting}
\end{equation}
%
The above exponential representation of the ratio in Eqn.\,\eqref{eq:reweighting} is only possible because the fermion determinant at a finite $\muI$ is positive definite for every gauge configuration $U$. With a fixed positive sign, the distribution formed from the values of this ratio from different configurations gives an idea about the extent of the overlap problem. More precisely, the severity of this problem is characterised by the tail of the distribution. A heavy tailed distribution\footnote{These distributions have large sample variance and often the sample mean is drastically different from the population mean.} is characterised by values which are highly apart from the distribution mean, manifesting with appreciable probability and this trait tends to change the sample statistics by a large extent. Although standard deviation can prove to be a reliable estimate characterising the heavy tail, a better quantitative measure is kurtosis $\kappa$ which is defined to be the standardised fourth order central moment. For a total of $N$ gauge field configurations, this is represented by:

\begin{equation}
    \kappa(\muI) = \frac{M_4^{\bar{x}}(\muI)}{(\sigma(\muI))^4}
\end{equation}
%
where $M_4^{\bar{x}}$ is the $4^{th}$ order central moment and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the distribution with mean $\bar{x}$. These are defined as
\begin{equation}
    M_4^{\bar{x}} = \frac{1}{N} \nsum_{i=1}^N (x_i-\bar{x})^4, \hspace{5mm} \sigma = \left[\frac{1}{N} \nsum_{i=1}^N (x_i-\bar{x})^2\right]^{\frac{1}{2}}, \hspace{5mm} \bar{x} = \frac{1}{N} \nsum_{i=1}^N x_i 
\end{equation}

where $x_i$ is the value of reweighting factor or the ratio of the fermion determinants obtained from $i^{th}$ configuration.

The blue points provide the measure of kurtosis. \label{fig:135_kurtosis}}
\end{figure}

We present results illustrating kurtosis as a function of real $\muI$ at the three temperatures, namely $135$, $157$ and $176$ MeV respectively. The calculations are performed for both $2^{nd}$ and $4^{th}$ orders in the cumulant and chemical potential bases and are demonstrated in Fig.\,\ref{fig:135_kurtosis}, \ref{fig:157_kurtosis} and \ref{fig:176_kurtosis} respectively. The red and black lines indicate the usual $\rho_I^0$ and $\rho_I^{\text{NR}}$ which have been already explained in the previous section. These lines intersect the positive real $\muI$ axis in the following Fig.\,\ref{fig:135_kurtosis}, \ref{fig:157_kurtosis} and \ref{fig:176_kurtosis} at $\muI^0$ and $\muI^{\text{NR}}$, where $\muI^0 = \rho_I^0$ and $\muI^{\text{NR}} = \rho_I^{\text{NR}}$. Although the absolute values of kurtosis are very large of $\Ob(10^3-10^4)$ as shown in the figures, the relative values of this kurtosis for successive values of $\muI$, forms the pivotal piece of interest here. As expected, all these figures feature that the value of the errorbars becomes strikingly large and increases at a rapid pace as the values of $\muI$ are increased beyond  $\muI^{\text{NR}}$ which is the value of Newton-Raphson radius of convergence. This signifies that across the singularity, there is a minimal overlap between the distributions generated at a finite $\muI$ and $\muI=0$. Hence, using an extrapolation from the data at $\muI=0$ to obtain thermodynamics at finite $\muI$, near and beyond these singularity values, is a very poor and ill-favoured idea.  

In Fig.\,\ref{fig:135_kurtosis}, we show that the magnitude of the errorbars start increasing as $\muI$ is increased beyond $\muI^0$. This is from where the average value of the phasefactor goes to zero as indicated by the red line. Besides putting an upper bound on the reliability of unbiased exponential resummation in real $\muI$, we also find that the red line marks the beginning of a significant increase in errorbars at $135$ MeV. Although the errorbars increase even more after crossing $\muI^{\text{NR}}$, the importance of $\muI^0$ as the starting point of these fluctuations cannot be underestimated. We find this behaviour of errorbars in both the $2^{nd}$ and $4^{th}$ order calculations for both the cumulant and chemical potential bases at this temperature. A similar set of observations and conclusions applies also for Fig.\,\ref{fig:157_kurtosis}, where we find this stark increase of errorbars beyond $\muI^0$, even more visibly appreciable. One may hold the reducing gap between $\muI^0$ and $\muI^{\text{NR}}$ responsible for this observation. These observations imply that this measure of phasefactor zeroes, rather than the nearest Newton-Raphson singularities for $135$ and $157$ MeV is a better and more reliable indicator to understand the onset of the severity of overlap problem.  

 The observations performed at $T=176$ MeV, as demonstrated in Fig.\,\ref{fig:176_kurtosis} very much support this implication. Although we find $\muI^{\text{NR}} < \muI^0$ at this temperature which highlights that the zeroes of this new phasefactor do not reliably reflect and capture the Newton-Raphson radius of convergence, we notice that the errorbars significantly increase as one crosses $\muI^0$ rather than $\muI^{\text{NR}}$ at this temperature. This is clearly evident from the $4^{th}$ order plots of cumulant and chemical potential bases. Although there is a commendable difference between $\muI^0$ and $\muI^{\text{NR}}$ and the errorbars start increasing across $\muI^{\text{NR}}$, the degree of increment of these errorbars is distinctly higher as one goes beyond $\muI^0$. This very much indicates that the severity of overlap problem maybe is a reflection of the genuine behaviour of integrand in the path integral of partition function $Z$ rather than its Newton-Raphson singularities.    



%Although there is an appreciable distinction between these two boundary lines in units of $\muI$ specially in the $4^{th}$ order calculations (bottom row) in Fig.\,\ref{fig:176_kurtosis} with negative $\diff$ and the errorbars increasing across the radius of convergence $\rho_I^{\text{NR}}$, but the degree of increment is palpably higher across the $\mu_I^0$. marking the start of rapidly oscillating integrand eventually causing the average phasefactor value to go down to zero.

\section{Summary and Conclusions}
\label{sec:Conclusions}

\hs In this paper, we have presented a new formalism of evaluating a non-trivial phasefactor at complex $\muI$ which can efficiently encapsulate the Newton-Raphson singularities of partition function $Z$ in the complex $\muI$ plane. These singularities are crucial to determine, because the thermodynamic observables become ill-defined for these values of $\muI$. Hence, they may reflect important signatures of a possible phase transition and manifest important aspects of the isospin phase diagram to some extent. The unbiased exponential resummation is considered since, it eliminates stochastic bias to a given order. The functional form of partition function obtained using this resummation is considered while evaluating the Newton-Raphson singularities. The determination of these singularities also leads to constructing the circle of convergence in the complex $\muI$ plane which is important for identifying the onset of breakdown for unbiased exponential resummation along the real $\muI$ axis. This becomes possible since the circle of convergence in the complex $\muI$ plane intersects the real $\muI$ axis at a finite value of $\muI$, thereby providing $\muI^{\text{NR}}$ beyond which this resummation is expected to break down. In support of this argument, we have illustrated the behaviour of isospin number density in real $\muI$, in which we have observed some degree of non-monotonicity of number density across $\muI^{\text{NR}}$. We have formulated a way of having a non-trivial phasefactor by complexifying $\muI$. This not only captures these singularities reliably, but also manages to put an upper bound of convergence and reliability in real $\muI$ for calculations starting from zero $\muI$. This bound implies that this resummation method fails to produce reliable results and consequently breaks down for real $\muI$ values greater than this bound. We find the value of this bound is less as well as not strikingly different from the point of intersection of the circle of convergence with the real $\muI$ axis, at least for $135$ and $157$ MeV which correspond to the hadronic and crossover regimes in the QCD phase diagram. This implies that at these temperatures, this new phasefactor is a more reliable indicator and by preceding over the value of $\muI^{\text{NR}}$, it can justify the non-monotonicity beyond radius of convergence and consequently can put warning signs which can be very helpful in producing reliable and genuine results.  In addition, we have demonstrated how the overlap problem signified by the tail of distribution of the reweighting factors become increasingly alarming with increasing values of $\muI$. We also observe that they become highly severe while crossing the bound $\muI^0$ from where this new phasefactor points start yielding zero continuously. Although this phasefactor at complex $\muI$ does not efficiently capture the singularities at $T=176$ MeV in the high temperature quark-gluon plasma regime, we observe that the relative kurtosis values of the distribution at different $\muI$ which gives a quantitative measure of the overlap problem, become extremely large with significantly lofty errorbars on crossing the phasefactor bound. Most importantly at this temperature, the errorbars noticeably increase much more across the phasefactor bound $\muI^0$ than the radius of convergence $\muI^{\text{NR}}$, obtained from the Newton-Raphson singularity in the complex $\muI$ plane. This very much imply that it is the rapid oscillations of the integrand of the partition function, rather than its Newton-Raphson singularities in the complex $\muI$ plane that contribute significantly to the severity of this overlap problem, and provide genuine indications of this problem.

\appendix
\section{Appendix: Basis transformation}
\label{sec:appendix}

In this appendix, we present the basis transformation formulae from $\left(u,d,s\right)$ basis to $\left(B,S,I\right)$ basis, where the symbols have their usual conventional meanings. The calculations in this paper have been performed after performing the basis transformation of the HotQCD data in $\left(u,d,s\right)$ to $\left(B,S,I\right)$ basis.

We use the usual quantum number conservation formulae as follows

\begin{align}
    B &= \frac{1}{3} \hspace{1mm}\bigg[N_u+N_d+N_s\bigg] \notag\\
    I &= \frac{1}{2} \hspace{1mm}\bigg[N_u-N_d\bigg] \notag\\
    S &= -N_s
    \label{eq:quant conservation}
\end{align}

where $N_u$, $N_d$, $N_s$ are the number of up, down and strange quarks respectively.  

Using the fact that fugacity $= \sum_k \mu_k N_k$ is basis independent, where $k$ characterises basis, we have 

\begin{equation}
    \mu_B B + \mu_S S + \mu_I I = \mu_u N_u + \mu_d N_d + \mu_s N_s
    \label{eq:fuga conser}
\end{equation}

Applying relations of \autoref{eq:quant conservation} in the above \autoref{eq:fuga conser} and equating coefficients of $N_u$, $N_d$ and $N_s$ which are all independent terms in $\left(u,d,s\right)$ basis, we obtain the following differentials for a given semi-positive definite integer $k$


\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial^k}{\partial \mu_B^k} &= \frac{1}{3^k} \left[\frac{\partial^k}{\partial \mu_u^k} + \frac{\partial^k}{\partial \mu_d^k} + \frac{\partial^k}{\partial \mu_s^k}\right] \notag \\
    \frac{\partial^k}{\partial \mu_S^k} &= - \frac{\partial^k}{\partial \mu_s^k} \notag \\
    \frac{\partial^k}{\partial \mu_I^k} &= \frac{1}{2^k} \left[\frac{\partial^k}{\partial \mu_u^k} - \frac{\partial^k}{\partial \mu_d^k}\right]
\end{align}

\abstract
{
 The recently introduced unbiased exponential resummation at finite chemical potential has become an important approach which promises to capture the higher order Taylor coefficients reliably appearing otherwise in the finite-density QCD Taylor series of thermodynamic observables. In this paper, we present a detailed comparative study between the usual Taylor coefficients upto eighth order and the corresponding estimates of the same coefficients obtained using unbiased exponential resummation at finite baryon and isospin chemical potentials. We also subsequently compare the different estimates of radius of convergence obtained from the Taylor expansion and the same procured from the unbiased exponential resummation scheme. We propose a new method of finding a non-trivial phasefactor estimate for isospin chemical potential and we attempt to explain the values of these different estimates of radius of convergence by observing the onset of zeroes of this gauge-ensemble average phasefactor for both baryon and isospin chemical potentials. Lastly, we also illustrate kurtosis plots describing the behaviour of overlap problem in isospin chemical potential and check if it maintains consistency with the appearance of zeros of the proposed phasefactor estimate for isospin chemical potential.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Intro}

\hs The strong force, one of the four fundamental forces of Nature is very well described by the quantum field theory of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)\,\cite{Gross:2022QCD}. An immensely important and intriguing spectacle in the paradigm of these strong interactions is the QCD phase diagram which features various interesting phases of strongly interacting matter. One of the important aspects of QCD is to explore and map this phase diagram\,\cite{Halasz:1998phasediagram, Rajagopal:1999phasediagram,Stephanov:2006phasediagram,Fukushima:2011phasediagram} as a function of temperature $T$ and baryochemical potential $\muB$. This is pivotal not only for understanding the strong dynamics at various energy scales, but also for illuminating the physics of early universe\,\cite{McGuigan:2008earlyuniverse,Castorina:2015earlyuniverse}. Despite being very robust and seemingly self-explanatory, most of this phase diagram have been constructed out from mere symmetry arguments and analyses of various QCD models. They continue to remain conjectured and await further conclusive evidences. In the quest of such evidences, one often resorts to formulating QCD on a lattice of spacetime\,\cite{Davies:2005latticeQCD,Boyle:2022latticeQCD} mostly because of its remarkable ability to successfully predict results to appreciable degree of precision. Besides offering possible signatures of unexplored phases, the non-perturbative formulation of thermodynamics in lattice QCD also enables one to obtain significant insights about the phase diagram.  Like at present, lattice simulations can well explain the manifestations at finite temperature, zero $\muB$ which resembles the vertical axis of the phase diagram. It also establishes that the phase transition between the hadronic phase and the quark-gluon plasma phases at zero $\muB$ is an analytical crossover\,\cite{Steinbrecher:2018QCDcrossover,Borsanyi:2020QCDcrossover,Bazavov:2018QCDcrossover,Li:2020QCDcrossover,Guenther:2021QCDcrossover}.


However for real finite $\muB$, lattice QCD faces a stumbling block in the shape of sign problem\,\cite{Gupta:2004signproblem,Danzer:2009signproblem,Goy:2016signproblem,Nagata:2021signproblem}. At finite $\muB$, the path integral\,\cite{Palumbo:2002pathintegral} expressing the QCD partition function $Z$ becomes complex with its measure containing a complex fermion determinant\,\cite{Nakamura:2005complexfermiondeterminant} which gives rise to the problem of complex measure. This complex measure hinders implementation of Monte-Carlo importance sampling for estimating this path integral. While reweighting\,\cite{Ejiri:2004reweighting,Li:2006reweighting} this complex measure with a real fermion determinant at zero $\muB$ makes the measure real, the observable part of the integral becomes complex which, after Monte-Carlo estimation provides a phaseangle $\theta$ and a subsequent phasefactor $\cos \theta$ for every gauge configuration of the working ensemble. The severity of this sign problem is governed by the magnitude of this $\cos \theta$ averaged over the entire ensemble, the value of which decreases towards zero for higher values of $\muB$ thereby reflecting increasing severity of the sign problem. This happens because the integrand exhibits tremendous oscillations across positive and negative real values, each of which is also large in magnitude, causing the mean to settle towards zero. This sign problem eventually leads to the breakdown of lattice QCD computations at a finite value of $\muB$ reflected by the non-monotonic behaviour of the calculated observables. This highly restricts our investigation and consequent knowledge of QCD at finite density.

Several new methods\,\cite{Bilic:1987Langevin,Aarts:2016Langevin,Kogut:2019Langevin,Sinclair:2019Langevin,Cristoforetti:2012Thimbles,Cristoforetti:2013Thimbles,Scorzato:2015Thimbles} have been introduced which can successfully avoid this sign problem, most of which unfortunately have very limited applications in QCD explicitly. In the case of QCD, the Taylor expansion around $\muB=0$\,\cite{Gavai:2003Taylor,Ejiri:2003Taylor,Gavai:2004Taylor,Gavai:2008Taylor,Miao:2008Taylor,Falcone:2010Taylor} and analytic continuation of simulations from imaginary to real $\muB$\,\cite{DElia:2002Analytic,Lombardo:2006Analytic,Sakai:2009Analytic} continue to remain the prominent methods for circumventing the sign problem and providing state-of-the-art results for QCD equation of state\,\cite{Fodor:2002EoS,Aoki:2005EoS,Miller:2006EoS,Karsch:2008EoS,Kanaya:2010EoS,Huovinen:2011EoS,Philipsen:2012EoS,Hegde:2014EoS,Bazavov:2017EoS} at finite $\muB$. Resummation approaches like  Pad{\'e}\,\cite{Cvetic:2011Pade,Pasztor:2020Pade,Bollweg:2022Pade} and exponential resummation\,\cite{Mondal:2021exponentialresummation} have been proposed, to improve the slowly convergent Taylor series results. While the former approximates the Taylor coefficients by rational functions where one is interested to find the roots and poles of these functions, the latter provides a direct estimate of $Z$ in the form of an exponential in which the argument comprises finite contributions of lower order Taylor series. Recently, the new formalism of unbiased exponential resummation\,\cite{Mitra:2023unb,Mitra:2022dae} has been introduced for obtaining a more improved QCD Equation of state at finite chemical potential, by obviating the stochastic bias\,\cite{Mitra:2022cumu} and reproducing the exact Taylor series to a given order in $\mu$, where $\mu$ is any generic flavor of chemical potential. This unbiased approach\,\cite{Mitra:2022Bonn} is paramount for recognising the genuine higher order Taylor contributions captured through this approach of resummation.

 Although the breakdown of calculations can be detected by observing the onset of the zeros of phasefactor for $\muB$, it is not the case for $\muI$ since it has no sign problem. Hence, it is not possible to identify a possible breakdown in $\muI$ by looking for the zeros of the phasefactor, which never becomes zero. Although this means that in principle, one can perform unbiased exponential resummation to all real values of $\muI$ extending to infinity, studies suggest that there is a genuine phase diagram\,\cite{deForcrand:2007isospin,Moller:2009isospin,Brandt:2017isospin,Brandt:2018isospin} in the $T-\muI$ plane which illustrates the formation of a pion condensate starting from some finite value of $\muI$ for a low $T$. This signifies that at a low $T$ surely, this formalism is supposed to have a finite radius of convergence in $\muI$ and is expected to experience a breakdown beyond that. Apart from many other objectives, this paper tries to come up with a new indicator for this purpose.





The paper is organised as follows: In Section \ref{sec:Unbiased exp}, we provide a quick overview about the Taylor expansion and the unbiased exponential resummation formalism, which constitute the two main cornerstone of comparisons in this paper. This is accompanied by a brief description about phasefactor of this resummation formalism, and the new idea of a complex phasefactor which is being proposed to identify possible breakdown for $\muI$. In Section \ref{sec:Overlap problem}, we have discussed briefly about the overlap problem and its severity along $\muI$. Starting from the details of scale setting and setup of lattice including random volume sources and gauge configurations used in constructing the Taylor coefficients, the method of error estimation for unbiased exponential resummation formalism are highlighted in Section \ref{sec:setup}. In Section \ref{sec:Results}, we present vivid discussions regarding the comparisons between the sixth and eighth order conserved charge cumulants for both $\muB$ and $\muI$ obtained from Taylor expansion and unbiased exponential resummation. We also demonstrate the same for the different estimates of the radius of convergence, and attempt to observe if the onset of zeros of the gauge ensemble averaged phasefactor $\LA \cos \theta \RA$ and complex phasefactor $\LA e^{i\theta} \RA$ can provide indications consistent with these estimates of radius of convergence for $\muB$ and $\muI$ respectively. If so, they can provide consistent indications about the start of breakdown for $\muB$ and $\muI$. In the last part of this section, we illuminate the behaviour of overlap problem in $\muI$ and see if this is compatible with the implications made by the zeros of phasefactor and their onset in $\muI$. We have concluded the paper and its discussion by providing a brief summary in Section \ref{sec:Conclusions}. Throughout this paper, we have used relativistic units ($\hbar = c = 1$) and unit Boltzmann constant, and have often denoted $\mu/T$ as $\mu$. Often we have used this notation $\mu$ in this paper to imply both $\muB$ and $\muI$.

\section{Taylor expansion and Unbiased exponential resummation}
\label{sec:Unbiased exp}

\hs In a $2+1$ flavor QCD with staggered rooted quarks, the grand-canonical partition function $Z$ with suppressed volume dependence for a given temperature $T$ and chemical potential $\mu$ is given as

\begin{equation}
    Z(T,\mu) = \int \mathcal{D}U \heq e^{-S_G\left[T,U\right]} \heq \det \M(T,\mu,U)
    \label{eq:partition function}
\end{equation}
%
with the fermionic determinant $\det \M(T,\mu,U)$ being 

\begin{equation}
\det \M(T,\mu,U) = \prod_{f=u,d,s} \big[\det \M(T,\mu_f,U)\big]^{1/4} 
\label{eq:staggered fermion}
\end{equation}
%
 In the above Eqns.\eqref{eq:partition function} and \eqref{eq:staggered fermion}, $U$ represent the gauge field configurations and functional $S_G\left[T,U\right]$ denotes the gluon action. For a thermodynamic system of volume $V$ at temperature $T$, the excess pressure $\Delta P(T,\mu)$ is given as follows:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\Delta P(T,\mu)}{T^4} = \frac{P(T,\mu) - P(T,0)}{T^4} = \frac{1}{VT^3} \, \ln \left[\frac{Z(T,\mu)}{Z(T,0)}\right]
    \label{eq:excess pressure}
\end{equation}
%
This measure of excess pressure in Eqn.\eqref{eq:excess pressure}, scaled in powers of $T$ is dimensionless which makes it useful for calculations at finite temperature on a given lattice. 


\subsection{Taylor Expansion}


The Taylor Expansion of this excess pressure to $\mathcal{O}(\mu^N)$ is given by 

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\Delta P_N^{\text{T}}(T,\mu)}{T^4} = \sum_{n=1}^{N/2} \frac{\chi_{2n}}{(2n)!} \left(\frac{\mu}{T}\right)^{2n}
    \label{eq:Taylor excess pressure}
\end{equation}
%
where in the above Eqn.\eqref{eq:Taylor excess pressure}, $\chi_{2n}$ is the conserved charge cumulant of order $2n$. The $n^{th}$ Taylor coefficient is defined as $c_n = \chi_n/n!$. The CP symmetry of QCD instructs this Taylor series of Eqn.\eqref{eq:Taylor excess pressure} to be even in $\mu$ which implies that $N$ is even. In terms of the different correlation functions $D_n$ where the $n^{th}$ order correlation function $D_n$ is defined as 

\begin{equation}
    D_n(T) = \frac{\partial^n \ln \det \M(T,\mu)}{\partial \mu^n}\Bigg|_{\mu=0} 
    \label{eq:correlation functions}
\end{equation}
%
the first four $\chi_n$ can be expressed as follows: 

\begin{align}
    \chi_1 &= \LA D_1 \RA \notag \\
    \chi_2 &= \LA D_2 \RA + \LA D_1^2 \RA \notag \\
    \chi_3 &= \LA D_3 \RA + 3\,\LA D_2\,D_1 \RA + \LA D_1^3 \RA \notag \\
    \chi_4 &= \LA D_4 \RA + 4\,\LA D_3\,D_1 \RA + 3\,\LA D_2^2 \RA + 6\,\LA D_2\,D_1^2 \RA + \LA D_1^4 \RA 
    \label{eq:Taylor coeff and correlation funs}
\end{align}
%
Throughout this paper, the notation $\LA \mathcal{O} \RA$ represents Monte-Carlo sampling average of observable $\mathcal{O}$ over all gauge configurations in the ensemble generated at $\mu=0$. All these powers are necessarily the unbiased powers of the respective $D_n$.

\subsection{Unbiased Exponential Resummation}

\subsubsection*{Exponential Resummation}
%
The method of exponential resummation commences with estimating the partition function directly and then deducing the thermodynamic quantities successively following the subsequent thermodynamic relations. In this approach, the ratio $Z(T,\mu)/Z(T,0)$ in the above Eqn.\eqref{eq:excess pressure} to $\mathcal{O}(\mu^N)$ is given by 
\begin{equation}
    Z_N^{\text{R}}(T,\mu) \equiv \frac{Z(T,\mu)}{Z(T,0)} = \Biggl< \exp \left(\nsum_{n=1}^N \left(\frac{\mu}{T}\right)^n \frac{D_n}{n!}\right)  \Biggr>    
    \label{eq:resummed partition function}
\end{equation}
%
%  
% where the notation $\LA \cdot \RA_0$ in Eqn.\eqref{eq:resummed partition function} represent Monte-Carlo sampling average over the working ensemble of gauge field configurations, each of which has been simulated at $\mu=0$. The expectation value of an observable $\mathcal{O}$ at an arbitrary $\mu$ and temperature $T$ calculated from an ensemble of gauge configurations simulated at $\muS$ at the same $T$ is given by
% \begin{align*}
%     \Big \langle \Ob(\mu) \Big \rangle_{\muS} &= \frac{1}{Z(\muS)} \int \mathcal{D}U \heq e^{-S_G\left[U\right]} \heq \Ob(\mu,U) \heq \det \M(\muS,U)
% \end{align*}
% %
% where we have from Eqn.\eqref{eq:partition function},
% \begin{equation*}
%     Z(\muS) = \int \mathcal{D}U \heq e^{-S_G\left[U\right]} \heq \det \M(\muS,U)
% \end{equation*}
% %
% We have subdued the $T$ dependence in the ongoing discussions of the paper, since the parameter of interest in this work is $\mu$.
%
with the symbols having conventional meanings as explained above.
On an isotropic\footnote{In isotropic lattice, spatial spacing $a_{\sigma} =$ temporal spacing $a_{\tau}$.} lattice of size $N_{\sigma}^3 \cdot N_{\tau}$ in $3+1$ spacetime having $N_{\sigma}$ points in each of the $3$ spatial directions and $N_{\tau}$ points in the temporal direction, the estimate of excess pressure for exponential resummation is obtained as follows:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\Delta P_N^{\text{R}}(T,\mu)}{T^4} = \left(\frac{N_{\tau}}{N_{\sigma}}\right)^3 \, \ln Z_N^{\text{R}}(T,\mu)
\end{equation}
%
 where the expression of $Z_N^{\text{R}}$ is given in the above Eqn.\eqref{eq:resummed partition function}. The partition function $Z$ for any real $\mu$ is real-valued by virtue of the CP symmetry of QCD. which makes the $D_n$ given in Eqn.\eqref{eq:correlation functions} real or imaginary for even or odd $n$ respectively. 
 
%  The $D_n$ are the usual temperature dependent $n$-point correlation functions given for every gauge configuration $U$ as the following  

% \begin{equation}
%     D_n(T,U) = \frac{\partial^n \ln \det \M(T,\mu,U)}{\partial (\mu/T)^n}\Bigg|_{\mu=0}
%     \label{eq:derivatives}
% \end{equation}
% 
%\subsection{Effect of finite random volume sources and stochastic bias}
\subsubsection*{Stochastic Bias}
%
 However since the fermion matrix $\M$ cannot be evaluated exactly using analytical means\,\cite{Ying:1998fermionmatrix}, these correlation functions $D_n$ require numerical estimation. This is done by considering a finite number of random volume sources for every gauge configuration and thereby estimating $D_n$ for every random source for each gauge configuration. Hence in this limit, $D_n$ of Eqn.\eqref{eq:resummed partition function} is replaced by $\overline{D_n}$, which is given as:

\begin{equation}
    \overline{D_n} = \frac{1}{N_R} \nsum_{r=1}^{N_R} D_n^{(r)}
    \label{eq:random volume sources}
\end{equation}
%
Here in Eqn.\eqref{eq:random volume sources}, $D_n^{(r)}$ is the estimate of $D_n$ in the $r^{th}$ random volume source and $N_R$ is the total number of such random volume sources. One also needs to extract the real part of this complex exponential in Eqn.\eqref{eq:resummed partition function} for determining the estimate of $Z_R^N$ preserving the CP symmetry of QCD. In this limit, the above Eqn.\eqref{eq:resummed partition function} therefore resembles

\begin{equation}
    Z_N^{\text{R}} = \text{Re} \,\LA \left[\exp \left(\nsum_{n=1}^N \left(\frac{\mu}{T}\right)^n \frac{\overline{D_n}}{n!}\right) \right] \RA
    \label{eq:modified resummed partition function}
\end{equation}
%%
where $\overline{D_n}$ is provided in Eqn.\eqref{eq:random volume sources}. Using finite $N_R$ results in stochastic bias in usual exponential resummation formula as well as provides biased estimates of different $D_n$ for every gauge configuration.
 A detailed description about this stochastic bias can be found in Ref.\,\cite{Mitra:2022cumu}. Although this bias decreases as $N_R^{-1}$, it can be very significant depending on the observable probed and the value and order of $\mu$ under consideration. It becomes highly imperative to eliminate this bias which can hinder genuine transparent understanding of underlying physics for finite-density QCD.  


\subsection{Unbiased formalism}

\hs The unbiased exponential resummation is formulated to eliminate this stochastic bias. In this formalism, the original structure of the resummation is retained with subtle modification of the argument of exponential. This is done so that on expansion in $\mu$, it produces unbiased estimates of $D_n$ and thereby reproduces Taylor series exactly to a given order in $\mu$. This is true for any flavor of chemical potential, although we have implemented this for $\muB$ and $\muI$ in this paper. For both $\muB$ and $\muI$, the unbiased formalism provides the following expression of the excess pressure $\Delta P/T^4$:

\begin{align}
    \frac{\Delta P_N^{\text{u}}(T,\mu)}{T^4} &= \frac{1}{VT^3} \ln Z_N^{\text{u}}(T,\mu) \hspace{.3cm}\text{where}\notag \\ 
    Z_N^{\text{u}}(T,\mu) &= \text{Re} \,\LA \left[\exp \left(\nsum_{n=1}^N \left(\frac{\mu}{T}\right)^n \frac{\overline{D_n^{\text{u}}}}{n!}\right) \right] \RA
    \label{eq:unbiased exponential resummation}
\end{align}
%
The above Eqn.\eqref{eq:unbiased exponential resummation} resembles Eqn.\eqref{eq:modified resummed partition function} with the notable exception that in the unbiased formalism, the argument of exponential in the expression of the unbiased partition function $Z_N^{\text{u}}$ comprises the unbiased estimates $\overline{D_n^{\text{u}}}$ of $D_n$ as the coefficient of $\mu^n$. A detailed proof along with other mathematical details of this formalism are presented in \cite{Mitra:2023unb}.


\subsection{Idea of complex isospin chemical potential and associated phasefactor}

The formalism of exponential resummation provides another significant entity which is the phasefactor. The gauge ensemble averaged phasefactor reflects the degree of $\mu$-dependent oscillations of $\det \M$. Close to the zeros of this average phasefactor, the oscillations become highly severe and may often lead to breakdown of calculations, rendering the formalism unreliable. Thus the manifestation of these zeros and their onset are interesting since they can provide a good estimate about the commencement of a possible breakdown. As mentioned regarding Eqn.\eqref{eq:modified resummed partition function}, the exponential of the complex polynomial comprising purely real (imaginary) $D_n$ for even (odd) values of $n$ yield a complex exponential. So for a complex function $z(T,\mu)$, this can be written as $e^z = R\,e^{i\theta}$ where

\begin{align*}
    R\left(T,\mu\right) = \exp{\bigg[\text{Re}\Big(z\left(T,\mu\right)\Big)\bigg]},\, \theta\left(T,\mu\right) = \text{Im}\bigg[z\left(T,\mu\right)\bigg]
\end{align*}

In the case of $\muB$, the exponential is complex for real values of $\muB$ and since one needs to extract the real part of the exponential, the phasefactor in this case is given by $\cos{\theta}$ for every gauge configuration. Hence in this situation we compute and observe the behaviour of $\LA \cos{\theta} \RA$ as a function of $\muB$. 

However for $\muI$, the exponential is always real for real $\muI$ since $D_n$ vanishes for odd $n$. Since $\theta(T,\mu)$\footnote{$\theta(T,\mu) = \sum_{n=1}^N (\frac{\mu}{T})^{2n-1} \text{Im}(D_{2n-1})$} only depends on odd $D_n$, hence $\theta=0$ for every gauge configuration for $\muI$, making $\cos{\theta}=1$. 
This makes identifying the breakdown in case of $\muI$ difficult by inspecting the behaviour of $\LA \cos{\theta} \RA$ for real $\muI$, just like $\muB$. In this paper, we propose to make $\muI$ complex which will make the resummation exponential complex. This will then provide us with a non-trivial phasefactor which will vary for various $\muI$ spanning the complex $\muI$ plane. Since CP symmetry does not guarantee partition function to be real for complex values of chemical potential, we observe the behaviour of the entire complex phasefactor $\LA e^{i\theta} \RA$ for complex $\muI$ as opposed to observing just $\LA \text{Re}(e^{i\theta}) \RA = \LA \cos{\theta} \RA$ for real $\muB$. The two dimensional phasefactor plots for $\muI$ have been constructed in this paper, by plotting the absolute value of $\LA e^{i\theta} \RA$ i.e. $\left|\LA e^{i\theta} \RA\right|$ as a function of  $\left|\muI\right|$.


\section{Overlap problem and its severity}
\label{sec:Overlap problem}

\hs In this section, we give a brief introduction to the overlap problem that becomes predominant in computations involving real $\muI$. Despite the abscence of sign problem in $\muI$, the calculations experience a genuine breakdown beyond a finite radius of convergence $\rho$.  


 While generating an ensemble of fermion and gauge field configurations at finite $\muI$ based on extrapolations from the ensemble generated at $\muI=0$, this problem arises
 when the distribution or sample comprising the ratio of fermion determinants at finite $\muI$ to zero $\muI$ i.e. $\det \M(\muI)/\det \M(0)$ becomes heavily tailed. This large tail of the distribution causes Monte-Carlo importance sampling ineffective, and renders reweighting approach inefficient in this limit. One comes across this ratio while reweighting the integrand of the path integral given in Eqn.\,\eqref{eq:partition function}, and this ratio assumes different values for different gauge configuration ensembles. In the realm of reweighting and exponential resummation where $\left|\muI\right| < \rho$, this ratio for a gauge configuration $U$ can be expressed as 

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\det \M(\muI,U)}{\det \M(0, U)} = \exp{\left[\nsum_{n=1}^{\infty} \muI^n \frac{D_n(U)}{n!}\right]}, \hs D_n(U) = \frac{\partial^n }{\partial \muI^n}\ln \det \M(\muI,U)\bigg|_{\muI=0}
    \label{eq:reweighting}
\end{equation}
%
The volume and temperature dependence of fermion determinant have been suppressed in the above Eqn.\eqref{eq:reweighting}, for the given gauge configuration $U$. These values of the above ratio for a given $\muI$ and for all such $U$ in the ensemble constitute the working sample or distribution and its tail characterises the magnitude and extent of overlap problem. A heavily tailed distribution\footnote{These distributions have large sample variance and often the sample mean is drastically different from the population mean.} will have greater extent of overlap problem. This is because in these distributions, the values radically different from the distribution mean, manifest with appreciable probability and this trait tends to change the sample statistics by a large extent. Although standard deviation can prove to be a reliable estimate characterising the heavy tail, a better quantitative measure is kurtosis $\kappa$ which is the standardised fourth order central moment. For a total of $N$ gauge field configurations, this is represented by:

\begin{equation}
    \kappa(\muI) = \frac{M_4^{\bar{x}}(\muI)}{(\sigma(\muI))^4}
\end{equation}
%
where $M_4^{\bar{x}}$ is the fourth order central moment and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the distribution with mean $\bar{x}$. These are defined as
\begin{align}
    M_4^{\bar{x}} = \frac{1}{N} \nsum_{i=1}^N (x_i-\bar{x})^4, \hspace{5mm} \sigma &= \left[\frac{1}{N} \nsum_{i=1}^N (x_i-\bar{x})^2\right]^{\frac{1}{2}}, \hspace{5mm} \bar{x} = \frac{1}{N} \nsum_{i=1}^N x_i
\end{align}
%
where $x_i = \left[\det \M(\muI)/\det \M(0)\right]_i$ is the value of the fermion determinant ratio obtained from $i^{th}$ configuration.
%
% given by 
%
% \begin{equation*}
%     x_i = \left[\frac{\det \M(\muI,U)}{\det \M(0, U)}\right]_i
% \end{equation*}
%
The manifestation of this overlap problem however may be different for different formalism which are adopted suitably for subsequent calculations for probing finite density QCD regime.

% \vspace{.5cm}

% \subsubsection*{Chemical potential basis}

%  For real $\mu$ in chemical potential basis, the unbiased exponential resummation resembles:
%     \begin{align}   %  6
%      \frac{\Delta P_{N}^{R(\text{unb})}(T,\mu)}{T^4} &= \frac{1}{VT^3} \hspace{.5mm}\ln \hspace{1mm}\left\{ \text{Re} \left \langle \bigg[\exp \Big(A_N\left(T,\mu\right)\Big)\bigg] \right \rangle \right\} , \, \text{where} \notag \\

%      \label{eq:mu basis}
%     \end{align}  %  6
%       %\\[0.2cm]
%       where the first four $\mathcal{C}_n (T)$ are given as follows:

% %&\hspace{3mm}
 
%  %\begin{widetext}
% \begin{align}
%     &\mathcal{C}_1 = \overline{D_1}, \notag \\
%     &\mathcal{C}_2 = \overline{D_2} + \left[\overline{(D_1)^2} - \overline{(D_1)}^2\right], \notag \\
%     &\mathcal{C}_3 = \overline{D_3} + 3\left(\overline{D_2 D_1} - \overline{D_2}\;\overline{D_1}\right) + 
%            \left(\overline{D_1^3} - 3\,\overline{(D_1)^2}\;\overline{D_1} + 2\,\left(\overline{D_1}\right)^3\right), \notag \\
%     &\mathcal{C}_4 = \overline{D_4} + 3\left(\overline{(D_2)^2} - \left(\overline{D_2}\right)^2\right)+ 4\left(\overline{D_3 D_1} - \overline{D_3}\;\overline{D_1}\right) + 6\left( \overline{D_2 (D_1)^2} - \overline{D_2}\;\overline{(D_1)^2}\right)  \notag \\

%      &\hspace{6cm}- 6\left(\overline{D_1}\right)^4 - 3\,(\overline{(D_1)^2})^2\Big)
% \label{eq:mu coefficients}
% \end{align}
% %
%  Here in Eqn.\,\eqref{eq:mu coefficients}, $\overline{D_n^p}$ indicates average of $p^{th}$ unbiased power of\footnote{In this analysis of $\muI$, these $D_n$ are isospin correlation functions.} $D_n$ over all the $N_{R}$ random volume sources contained within a given gauge field configuration. Eqn.\,\eqref{eq:mu basis} along with Eqn.\,\eqref{eq:mu coefficients} eliminates stochastic bias upto $\Ob(\mu^4)$. In the forthcoming discussions, these $D_n$ are used to denote isospin correlation functions only.


% %\vspace{.5cm}

% \subsubsection*{Cumulant basis}

% For real $\mu$ in cumulant basis, this formalism looks as follows:

%  \begin{align}   %  6
%      &\frac{\Delta P_{N,M}^{R(\text{unb})}(T,\mu)}{T^4} = \frac{1}{VT^3} \hspace{1mm}\ln \hspace{.5mm} \left\{\text{Re} \LA \bigg[\exp \Big(W_M\big[X_N\left(T,\mu\right)\big]\Big)\bigg] \RA\right\}, \, \text{where} \notag \\ 
%      &W_M\big[X_N\left(T,\mu\right)\big] = \nsum_{m=1}^{M} \frac{\mathcal{L}_{m}\left(X_N\right)}{m!} \, ,  \hspace{3mm} X_N(T,\mu) = \sum_{n=1}^N \left(\frac{\mu}{T}\right)^n \frac{D_n}{n!}
%       \label{eq:cumulant basis}
%       \end{align}
% %
% The $\L_m$ for $1 \leq m \leq 4$ in the expression of $W_M$ of above Eqn.\eqref{eq:cumulant basis} are as follows:

% \begin{align}
%    \L_1 &= \overline{X_N}, \notag \\
%    \L_2 &= \overline{(X_N)^2} - \big(\overline{X_N}\big)^2, \notag \\
%    \L_3 &= \overline{(X_N)^3} - 3\,\big(\overline{X_N}\big)\;\overline{(X_N)^2} + 2\,\big(\overline{X_N}\big)^3, \notag \\
%    \L_4 &= \overline{(X_N)^4}- 4\,\overline{(X_N)^3}\;\big(\overline{X_N}\big)  
%          + 12\,\big(\overline{X_N}\big)^2\;\overline{(X_N)^2} - 6\,\big(\overline{X_N}\big)^4- 3\,\big(\overline{(X_N)^2}\big)^2
% \label{eq:cumulant L}
% \end{align}
% %
% Implementing the formalism in this basis following Eqn.\,\eqref{eq:cumulant basis}, using the expressions of Eqn.\,\eqref{eq:cumulant L} leads to reproducing the first $4$ cumulants exactly of unbiased cumulant expansion, where the cumulants are expressed in terms of unbiased powers. We observed that this formalism not only eliminates stochastic bias upto a finite order in $\mu$, it can also capture higher order Taylor contributions successfully. On adding more number of $\L_n$ or $\mathcal{C}_n$, one approaches exponential resummation unbiased to all orders in $\mu$ which in infinite series limit, replicates infinite Taylor series in $\mu$. The unbiased exponential resummation used in this work eliminates stochastic bias upto $\muI^4$ using $C_n$, for $n \leq 4$ in chemical potential basis and $M=4$ in cumulant basis for both second and fourth order calculations. 

% \subsection{Phasefactor analysis in unbiased exponential resummation}

% \hs When chemical potential $\mu$ is complex, the partition function $Z$ also becomes complex\footnote{The CP symmetry guarantees $Z$ to be real, only for real $\mu$.} unlike Eqns.\,\eqref{eq:mu basis} and \eqref{eq:cumulant basis}. As a result, this partition function can then be expressed in familiar polar amplitude form $R(T,\mu)\,e^{i\Theta(T,\mu)}$, where $R(T,\mu)$ is the real-valued positive definite phase-quenched reweighting factor and $e^{i\Theta}$ is the complex phasefactor, with real-valued phaseangle $\Theta(T,\mu)$. 

% \hspace{-.9cm} For chemical potential basis, 
% \begin{equation}
%     R_N(T,\mu) = \exp{\bigg[\text{Re}\Big(A_N\big(T,\mu\big)\Big)\bigg]}, \hspace{.5cm} \Theta_N(T,\mu) = \text{Im}\bigg[A_N\big(T,\mu\big)\bigg]
%     \label{eq:mu_phasefactor}
% \end{equation}
% %
% In case of cumulant basis,
% \begin{equation}
%     R_{N,M}(T,\mu) = \exp{\Bigg[\text{Re}\bigg(W_M\Big[X_N\big(T,\mu\big)\Big]\bigg)\Bigg]}, \hspace{.5cm} \Theta_{N,M}(T,\mu) = \text{Im}\bigg(W_M\Big[X_N\big(T,\mu\big)\Big]\bigg)
%     \label{eq:cumulant_phasefactor}
% \end{equation}

% In this paper, we perform analysis for finite $\muI$ and investigate the breakdown of unbiased exponential resummation. This is performed by observing the behaviour of thermodynamic observables like isospin excess pressure and isospin susceptibility across the radius of convergence estimated from the numerical determination of Lee-Yang zeros of $Z$ through Newton-Raphson iteration method. This estimate of radius of convergence is then compared with that indicated by the close-to-zero values of $\left|e^{i\Theta}\right|$. 

% Unlike baryon chemical potential $\muB$ or chemical potentials having a sign problem, there is no such problem for $\muI$ and so, the average phasefactor $\LA \cos{\Theta} \RA$ is unity for all values of real $\muI$. This makes this measure of phasefactor unsuitable for identifying and locating the breakdown, along real $\muI$. 
% The idea therefore is to make $\muI$ complex, which will make the reweighting factor, and partition function $Z$ complex. The average complex phasefactor $\LA e^{i\Theta} \RA$ is computed as a function of complex $\muI$ and we observe if we can conclude something about the breakdown of lattice computations along real $\muI$ from its behaviour. 

\section{Setup of calculations}
\label{sec:setup}

\hs In this work, we have extensively used the data generated by the HotQCD collaboration for its ongoing Taylor expansion calculations and charge fluctuations. We discuss the setup and other important relevant details of this data, in this section. 

The QCD action considered for generating the working data of the calculations in this work follows a $2+1$ flavor signature in which the strange quark is $27$ times more massive than the mass degenerate up and down quarks. This action comprises a Symanzik-improved gauge action\,\cite{Symanzik:1983gauge,Symanzik:1983gauge2nd}
and the Highly Improved Staggered Quark (HISQ) fermion action\,\cite{Gabrielli:1990Improvement,MILC:2008HISQ,MILC:2010HISQ}. Gauge field configurations of order $\Ob(10^4$ - $10^6)$ are generated in the temperature range $135$~MeV~$\lesssim~T~\lesssim$~$176$~MeV with $\Nt=8$, $12$ and $16$ and $\Ns=4\Nt$. In this work, an isotropic lattice of size $32^3 \cdot 8$ has been used in Euclidean four spacetime, which is Wick rotated from the usual $3+1$ relativistic Minkowski spacetime. Following the relation $T=(a\Nt)^{-1}$, the temperature for each $\Nt$ is varied by varying the isotropic lattice spacing $a$ through the inverse gauge coupling\footnote{$\beta=6/g^2$ where $g$ is the QCD coupling parameter.} $\beta$. For each $a$, the bare light and strange quark masses $m_l(a)$ and $m_s(a)$ are also tuned so that the pseudo-Goldstone pion and kaon masses produced become equal to the physical pion ($\pi$) and kaon ($K$) masses respectively. This fixes the line of constant physics for the lattice setup under consideration. The scale setting is determined using both the Sommer parameter $r_1$ and the kaon decay constant $f_K$. A complete description of the gauge ensembles and scale setting is provided in Ref.~\,\cite{Bollweg:2021vqf}.

To calculate the Taylor coefficients for unbiased exponential resummation, the baryon and isospin correlation functions $D_1,\dots,D_4$ are estimated stochastically using $500$ Gaussian volume sources on each gauge configuration. For a detailed derivation of these $D_n$, refer to \cite{Allton:2005Taylor}. The exponential-$\mu$ formalism is used to calculate these four derivatives, and further higher derivatives are calculated using the linear-$\mu$ formalism. Using this data, we have calculated the necessary following results to be discussed vividly in the next section for $\muB$ and $\muI$ using the methods of Taylor expansion and unbiased exponential resummation. These are computed in the range $0 \leqslant \lvert \mu_{I}/T \rvert \leqslant 2.5$, using $100K$ configurations for $\muB$ and $20K$ configurations per temperature for $\muI$. Our results have been obtained on $\Nt=8$ lattices for three temperatures namely at $T \sim 135$, $157$ and $176$ MeV. Besides describing the hadronic, crossover and QGP phases of QCD phase diagram, these temperatures have been chosen carefully as being approximately equal to $\Tpc$ and $\Tpc\pm20$~MeV, where $\Tpc=156.5(1.5)$~MeV is the chiral crossover temperature at zero baryon chemical potential $\muB$ for physical values of bare quark masses\,\cite{Steinbrecher:2018phh}. The same temperatures have been chosen as the working temperatures for $\muI$ also. 

In calculations involving unbiased exponential resummation, we have considered taking $100$ bootstrap samples of the working gauge configuration ensemble. This bootstrapping algorithm used, is based on a chosen random number generator and is implemented to calculate the errorbars associated with values of the observables for each value of $\muI$ considered. In a separate section of this paper, we have explained the setup and characteristics of the Newton-Raphson method which we have used to estimate the zeros of the partition function and identify the manifestation of a possible breakdown in calculations.


\section{Results}
\label{sec:Results}


\subsection{For baryon chemical potential}

In this section, we present a comparative study between the measures of baryon cumulants of sixth and eighth orders obtained using the usual Taylor Expansion and the measures of the same that appear on expansion of the unbiased exponential resummation formula. The Taylor coefficients\footnote{Taylor coefficient is just the charge cumulant scaled by appropriate factorial.} using the Taylor expansion are procured from the different unbiased powers of the corresponding baryon or isospin correlation functions, as given in Eqn.\eqref{eq:Taylor coeff and correlation funs}. 
As mentioned before, the manifestation of the stochastic bias has already been observed in the old exponential resummation formula\,\cite{Mondal:2021exponentialresummation} and not only we have understood the importance of eliminating this bias\,\cite{Mitra:2022cumu}, we also have come up with the unbiased exponential resummation\,\cite{Mitra:2023unb} which replicates the exact Taylor coefficients corresponding to the appropriate powers of $\mu$. Thus within its all-order series, it reproduces Taylor series upto a desired order in $\mu$ which leads to a more improved QCD Equation of state and enabling one to comprehend the true physics of finite-density QCD, to a more reliable extent. 


% As mentioned before, the formalism of the unbiased exponential resummation replicates the exact Taylor coefficients corresponding to the appropriate powers of $\mu$ and consequently produces Taylor series upto a desired order in $\mu$, which here refers to both $\muB$ and $\muI$. The manifestation of stochastic bias in the old exponential resummation formula\,\cite{Mondal:2021exponentialresummation} has already been observed and as an outcome, we have understood the importance of eliminating this bias\,\cite{Mitra:2022cumu} in obtaining the correct results thereby knowing the underlying genuine physics of finite-density QCD. 




The higher order charge cumulants or coefficients, are particularly of great significance. Owing to the higher powers of $\mu$ associated with these coefficients, their values strongly influence the behaviour of Taylor series for larger values of $\mu$ ($\mu/T>1$), which is instrumental for understanding finite-density QCD. From a computational point of view, it is very difficult and expensive to evaluate these higher order Taylor coefficients as they require calculating higher order correlation functions and also the higher unbiased powers of the required lower-order correlation functions. So, it is very challenging to evaluate these Taylor coefficients precisely and therefore would be promising if they can be ascertained using some other alternative means, from which they can be obtained with similar precision at the expense of relatively less computational complexities. In this paper, we attempt to testify this using unbiased exponential resummation of second and fourth orders for finite $\muB$ and $\muI$ and compare the subsequent results between these two approaches. 

\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{Plots of sixth and eighth order charge cumulants $\chi_6^B$ (left) and $\chi_8^B$ (right) obtained using the Taylor expansion and also from the unbiased exponential resummation of second, fourth and sixth orders at $T=135$ MeV. The green points indicate the usual Taylor estimate whereas the red, blue and black lines represent the corresponding coefficients for second, fourth and sixth orders respectively.}
    \label{fig:chi 135_B sixth and eighth}
\end{figure}

Fig.\ref{fig:chi 135_B sixth and eighth} represents the plots of $\chi_6$ and $\chi_8$ obtained using the usual Taylor Expansion method and the unbiased exponential resummation approach. The $\cnBT$ depicts the estimate of $\chi_n^B$ acquired using Taylor expansion, whereas $\cnBm$ represents the same procured from unbiased exponential resummation of order $m$. The subsequent similar plots in the paper follow this nomenclature of symbols only, even for the plots of $\muI$ in the later section of the paper. While estimating $\cnBm$, all the correlation functions $D_p,\, 1 \leq p \leq m$ are included and all the higher correlation functions are excluded i.e. $D_p=0$ for $p \geq (m+1)$. So, it is quite evident that the sixth order unbiased exponential resummation contains the necessary unbiased powers of $D_n$ upto $n=6$ and hence in principle, $\csBs =\csBT$ (Eqn.\eqref{eq:Taylor coeff and correlation funs}). This is clearly demonstrated in the left plot of Fig.\ref{fig:chi 135_B sixth and eighth} where the green and the black lines representing respective $\csBT$ and $\csBs$ matches exactly, with the errorbars also in perfect alignment with each other. While there is a difference between the values and errorbars of $\csBT$ and $\csBt$ as shown by the red points, the blue points representing $\csBf$ clearly reveal that $\csBf$ obtained from the fourth order resummation remains in a very good agreement with $\csBT$. This is despite not including the baryon correlation functions $D_5$ and $D_6$ in the estimate of $\csBf$ unlike $\csBT$. 
In the case of $\chi_8^B$, all the estimates obtained from the second, fourth and sixth order resummations are more or less in a very good and commendable agreement with the Taylor estimate at $T=135$ MeV. This is quite promising in the sense that one can only estimate $D_1^B$ and $D_2^B$ and can safely rely on adopting a second order unbiased exponential resummation approach to evaluate the estimate of $\chi_8^B$ without too much of requiring to evaluate higher correlation functions from $D_3^B$ onwards. As implied by Fig.\ref{fig:chi 135_B sixth and eighth}, the resulting $\ceBt$ obtained would not differ drastically from $\ceBT$, which is the corresponding Taylor series estimate of $\chi_8^B$.

\begin{figure}[H]

These are obtained at $157$ (top row) and $176$ MeV (bottom row) respectively.}
    \label{fig:chi 157_B and 176_B sixth and eighth}
\end{figure}

 The same argument also holds true for the other two temperatures at $157$ and $176$ MeV respectively as shown in the Fig.\ref{fig:chi 157_B and 176_B sixth and eighth}. In both Fig.\ref{fig:chi 135_B sixth and eighth} and Fig.\ref{fig:chi 157_B and 176_B sixth and eighth}, we observe that although the second order resummation estimates $\csBt$ and $\ceBt$ of $\chi_6^B$ and $\chi_8^B$ exhibit some noticeable difference from the corresponding Taylor estimates $\csBT$ and $\ceBT$, it is from the fourth order onwards that the resummation estimate values for both $\chi_6$ and $\chi_8$ along with errorbars becomes almost perfectly identical and agrees appreciably well with the corresponding Taylor counterparts. This is found by comparing the blue and black points with the green point in Figs.\ref{fig:chi 135_B sixth and eighth} and \ref{fig:chi 157_B and 176_B sixth and eighth} where the former pair of points represent the fourth and sixth order resummation estimates and the latter illustrates the Taylor estimate.
 
 More importantly, this set of observations holds true for all the three working temperatures; $135$, $157$ and $176$ MeV which have been chosen so that they represent hadronic, crossover and plasma phases of the QCD phase diagram for physical quark and pion masses, and thereby span a major part of the phase diagram. This implies that the calculation of unbiased estimates upto $D_4$ for $\muB$ or equivalently upto $\mathcal{O}(\muB^4)$ is good enough and sufficient to reproduce Taylor series upto $\mathcal{O}(\muB^8)$ irrespective of whether or not, the stochastic bias from $D_5$ is taken care of. The question of whether this remains true for even higher powers of $\muB$ beyond $\muB^8$ is certainly a very interesting and coveted work for the future and if found true, it can constrain our tedious efforts to introduce unbiased estimates to higher orders, to a great extent. One may attribute this to the fact that the ultraviolet divergences remain in lattice calculations only upto the fourth power of $\mu$ or $\mathcal{O}(\mu^4)$, for $\mu \equiv \muB, \muI$. To cancel out these divergences, one needs to adopt the full exponential $\mu$ formalism and use all the resulting terms to evaluate all $D_n$ upto $D_4$. Beyond this that is from $D_5$ onwards, the linear $\mu$ formalism utilising only the first order $\mu$ derivatives of $\M$ suffices. Although the exponential $\mu$ formalism continues to remain valid in this domain also, one prefers to embrace the linear $\mu$ formalism for its calculational simplicity and less computational time. Owing to the prescence of these divergences, stochastic random volume estimates of $D_n,\,n \leq 4$ fluctuate a lot among the different random sources thereby contributing maximally to the resulting stochastic bias in the final results.
So for obtaining physically meaningful and genuinely reliable results, one not only must eliminate these divergences but also needs to calculate the unbiased powers of these stochastically estimated correlation functions and then using their subsequent values in the final computations. 


Apart from the estimates of these individual coefficients, we also compare and present results regarding the different estimates of radius of convergence obtained from the Taylor expansion and the unbiased exponential resummation methods. The radius of convergence of a Taylor series determines the value of the parameter of expansion ($\mu$ in this case) upto which the series approximation provides reliable results and hence, it is also significant for identifying the possible breakdown of calculations using Taylor series approximations. As stated before, owing to the CP symmetry or particle-antiparticle symmetry of QCD, the Taylor series of QCD excess pressure (see Eqn.\eqref{eq:Taylor excess pressure}) is even in $\mu \equiv \muB/\muI$ for which the radius of convergence $\rho$ in principle is given by 

\begin{equation}
    \rho = \lim_{n \to \infty} \rho_n ,\hspace{2mm} \text{where} \hspace{2mm} \rho_n=\sqrt{\frac{\chi_{2n}}{\chi_{2n+2}}}
    \label{eq:est of rad of conv}
\end{equation}
%
Although the radius of convergence is introduced mathematically in the context of Taylor series only, we have measured the different estimates of this radius of convergence $\rho$ in unbiased exponential resummation too. This is because on expansion of this resummed series in terms of $\mu$, it resembles a Taylor series whose resulting coefficients differ from the usual Taylor coefficients, depending on the resummation order and also on the given order of $\mu$. In this work, this has been done by measuring the appropriate charge cumulants of different orders using this resummation method and following Eqn.\eqref{eq:est of rad of conv}.

In this work, we have measured three estimates of the radius of convergence using this unbiased exponential resummation. These estimates are $\rho_1$, $\rho_2$ and $\rho_3$ which are obtained by inserting $n=1,2,3$ in the Eqn.\eqref{eq:est of rad of conv}. 
Since the highest order Taylor series used in this work is of eighth order, the best estimate of radius of convergence is $\rho_3 = (\chi_{6}/\chi_{8})^{1/2}$. In the Fig.\ref{fig:all ROC 135_B 157_B and 176_B}, we have presented the plots of different estimates of $\rho$ as given in Eqn.\eqref{eq:est of rad of conv} for $n=1,2,3$. As before, these have been compared after obtaining them using the Taylor expansion approach and also through the method of unbiased exponential resummation for second, fourth and sixth orders in $\muB$.
The different estimates $\rho_1, \rho_2$ and $\rho_3$ of the radius of convergence have been plotted at $135$, $157$ and $176$ MeV respectively. We clearly find that although the second order resummation estimates $(\rho_n^B)_2$ for $n=1,2,3$ shown by the red points in Fig.\ref{fig:all ROC 135_B 157_B and 176_B} vary to some appreciable extent against the corresponding Taylor estimates $(\rho_n^B)_T$ illustrated by the green points, the agreement becomes appreciable and very much perfect from the fourth order onwards. Importantly, this holds true for all the three estimates $\rho_1$, $\rho_2$ and $\rho_3$ in which the agreement in $n=1$ for all $\rho$ except $(\rho_n^B)_2$ is trivial. This is because in second order resummation, $D_3$ and $D_4$ are excluded which are required otherwise for a complete estimation of $\chi_4^B$. This agreement in $\rho$ is somewhat expected to follow consequently, after our previous findings regarding Figs.\ref{fig:chi 135_B sixth and eighth} and \ref{fig:chi 157_B and 176_B sixth and eighth}.

We also present our observations regarding the behaviour of the gauge ensemble averaged phasefactor $\LA \cos \theta \RA$ as a function of $\muB$ in the Fig.\ref{fig:ROC 135,157,176_B all with phasefactor}, and subsequently check if the onset of the zeros of this phasefactor happens at values of $\muB$ identical to the acquired estimates of the radius of convergence and thereby can identify the initiation of breakdown of calculations. As introduced before, this phasefactor is $e^{i\theta}$ whose real part $\cos \theta$ needs to be analysed for $\muB$ since the partition function is real for real $\muB$ which we are looking for. This is obtained from the unbiased exponential resummation where the red and black points in the plots of the lower row of Fig.\ref{fig:ROC 135,157,176_B all with phasefactor} indicate that of second order and fourth order respectively. The blue line in the lower row plots is the zero line of the phasefactor and the magenta dotted line in the upper row plots provides the value of $\muB$ from which $\LA \cos{\theta}_n \RA=0$ for $n=2,4$, as can be observed from the lower row plots. From the Fig.\ref{fig:ROC 135,157,176_B all with phasefactor}, it is explicitly observed that the zeros of $\LA \cos \theta \RA$ for both the orders agree very well with each other and also become zero starting from the same value of $\muB$. This is true despite this value being different for all the temperatures. Even though the magenta line lies somewhere between $\rho_2$ and $\rho_3$ at $176$ MeV, it shows appreciably good agreement for $T=135$ and $157$ MeV where it intersects all the three estimates within the errorbars. Significantly for these two temperatures, this line is in good agreement with the estimate of $\rho_3$ which as discussed before, is supposedly the most reliable estimate of radius of convergence out of these three estimates. This thereby demonstrates that for these two temperatures at least, the onset of the zeros of $\LA \cos{\theta}\RA$ give very agreeable values of $\rho$ and hence commendable indications about the onset of breakdown in $\muB$.


% It is interesting to observe this behaviour and its implications regarding the various estimates of the radius of convergence obtained using either the Taylor Expansion or the unbiased exponential resummation. Although for real $\muB$ the reweighting factor is complex thereby giving a non-trivial phasefactor $\LA \cos{\Theta} \RA$ varying with real $\muB$, this is not an option for real $\muI$ where the reweighting factor is purely real. Owing to this, one finds the phasefactor to be trivially unity for all gauge configurations for all values of real $\muI$.
% In this paper besides comparing different estimates with the zeros of $\LA \cos{\Theta} \RA$ for $\muB$, we attempt to complexify $\muI$ where the reweighting factor becomes complex. This then provides us with a complex phasefactor and we conduct a comparative study between the zeros of this gauge ensemble averaged phasefactor with the different estimates for $\muI$.

% This is also checked and compared with the zeros of phasefactor procured while performing unbiased exponential resummation, which is vividly illustrated in Fig.\ref{fig:ROC 135,157,176_B all with phasefactor}. The average phasefactor is calculated using second and fourth order unbiased exponential resummation, and are illustrated through red and black points respectively for all the three working temperatures. Although the location of zero for $T=176$ MeV is not very consistent with the different estimates of the radius of convergence namely $\rho_n$ for $n=1,2,3$, the agreement and consistency is appreciable for the other two temperatures at $135$ and $157$ MeV. For these two temperatures, the zero line coincides with the points within errorbars.

In this section, we present results for isospin chemical potential $\muI$. The comparison regarding $\chi_6$ and $\chi_8$ is illustrated for all the three working temperatures in Fig.\ref{fig:chi_6 and chi_8 135,157,176_I}. However as compared to $\muB$ we find from Fig.\ref{fig:chi_6 and chi_8 135,157,176_I}, the second order resummation estimates for $\chi_6$, namely $\csIt$ vary to a greater extent against the equivalent Taylor estimate $\csIT$. We also find that this difference reduces with increasing temperature for $\chi_6$, seemingly suggesting that the corrections introduced by the unbiased estimates of $D_n$ from $D_3$ to $D_6$, over $D_1$ and $D_2$ in the evaluation of $\csIT$ become less pronounced with increasing temperature. Despite this, we find just like $\muB$ the agreement becomes very good from fourth order onwards and as usual being $\csIs=\csIT$, the black and green points agrees almost completely along with the errorbars. In case of $\chi_8^I$ also, the disagreement is noticeable at second order but again from fourth order the extent of agreement is very good and commendable for all the three working temperatures. As before, this seem to imply that it is important maybe to just consider having unbiased estimates upto $D_4$ only.

    \label{fig:ROC 135,157,176_I all with phasefactor_2nd}
\end{figure}


Just like $\muB$, we have also plotted the different estimates of radius of convergence in Fig.\ref{fig:ROC 135,157,176_I all with phasefactor_2nd} for $\muI$ and compared the compatibility of different estimates obtained from the Taylor expansion and unbiased exponential resummation approaches. However unlike $\muB$, we have determined the complex phasefactor $e^{i\theta}$ for complex $\muI$, computed its gauge ensemble average $\LA e^{i\theta} \RA$ and observed its behaviour for various complex $\muI$. This is because as mentioned before, the partition function does not have to be real for complex chemical potentials. We have traced a two-dimensional plot of $|\LA e^{i\Theta} \RA|$ against $\left|\muI\right|$ which is the radial distance of the complex $\muI$ from the origin in the complex $\muI$ plane. Unlike $\muB$, there is a possibility of having multiple points of phasefactor for a given $\muI/T$\footnote{This is because $x+i\,y$ and $y+i\,x$ will have same value of $\muI/T$, but can have different values of $\LA e^{i\theta} \RA$.} in the phasefactor plots of $\muI$ in Fig.\ref{fig:ROC 135,157,176_I all with phasefactor_2nd} and hence as we observe, there are more number of points as compared to $\muB$. Despite the magenta line of the Fig.\ref{fig:ROC 135,157,176_I all with phasefactor_2nd} not intersecting with $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$ at $135$ and $157$ MeV, we find that it intersects with the estimate of $\rho_3$ for both these temperatures. Thus, the point of the first appearance of zeros of $|\LA e^{i\Theta} \RA|$ procured using second and fourth order unbiased resummation approaches, provides commendable indications about the radius of convergence and the possible breakdown at least for eighth order Taylor series. This is somewhat promising, although the agreement with the same is not so well-defined at $176$ MeV.  We may have to look out for some other indicators of radius of convergence at this temperature, or maybe the physics at this temperature is somewhat different which cannot be explained using the present method of unbiased exponential resummation and the associated phasefactor determination. It may also signify that maybe in order to capture the genuine behaviour of the Taylor series at $176$ MeV, it is important to go to even higher order calculations or it may also require the determination of even higher-than-fourth-order calculation of unbiased phasefactor.

    \label{fig:135,157,176_I kurtosis}
\end{figure}

Lastly, we also present results manifesting the behaviour of kurtosis as a function of $\muI/T$. The kurtosis offers a quantitative measure of the overlap problem and its severity, which have been briefly discussed before. This overlap problem becomes visibly predominant for $\muI$ where there is no sign problem, and maybe the most possible reason for a breakdown. In the Fig.\ref{fig:135,157,176_I kurtosis}, we observe that both the second and fourth order kurtosis exudes a monotonically increasing behaviour for higher values of $\muI$. This is expected since the extent of overlap between distributions generated at finite $\muI$ and zero $\muI$ reduces with increasing value of the finite $\muI$, and is evident from the higher values of the associated errorbars as seen in Fig.\ref{fig:135,157,176_I kurtosis}. The red vertical line depicts the commencement of zero of $\LA e^{i\theta} \RA$, which coincides with the value of magenta line shown in Fig.\ref{fig:ROC 135,157,176_I all with phasefactor_2nd}. The Fig.\ref{fig:135,157,176_I kurtosis} demonstrates that the errorbars increases rapidly across this red line which implies that as the oscillations of the complex fermionic determinant for complex $\muI$ increases making $\LA e^{i\theta} \RA \approx 0$, the overlap problem rapidly increases. This is manifested by the increasing errorbars, non-monotonic behaviour of the kurtosis values. This is an encouraging sight as one can understand the severity of this overlap problem and associated breakdown by studying the behaviour of this newly proposed complex phasefactor and observing the onset of its zeroes or close-to-zero values. 

% of this newly proposed complex phasefactor does offer for this overlap problem is consistent for all the working temperatures, to a good extent with the onset of the zero of the proposed complex phasefactor $\left|\LA e^{i\theta}\RA\right|$. Beyond the value of $\muI$ at which the first zero of $\left|\LA e^{i\theta}\RA\right|$ appears, the overlap problem becomes very severe and the errorbars also become extremely large along with a non-monotonic behaviour of the mean values of $\kappa_2$ and $\kappa_4$.












\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:Conclusions}


In this paper, we have conducted a detailed comparative study between the estimates of higher order charge cumulants, which have been obtained using the approaches of Taylor expansion and the unbiased exponential resummation. The estimates of these cumulants are exact in Taylor expansion, in the sense that all the necessary and appropriate correlation functions have been included with proper estimation of their unbiased powers before averaging them over the working gauge ensemble. On the other hand, correlation functions only upto order $N$ are kept in $N^{th}$ order unbiased exponential resummation and it is only from these non-zero correlation functions in this method that the respective charge cumulants of sixth and eighth orders are evaluated and estimated.

Although there still remains a lot to investigate and make further progress, it has been evident from the aforementioned results that the resummed estimates of the sixth and eighth order charge cumulants seem to give excellent agreement with the corresponding Taylor-equivalent estimates. Despite making comparisons only upto eighth order, it is found that resummation results from fourth order onwards seemingly provide some order-independent compatibility and agreement with the corresponding Taylor series results. Although a lot more needs to be done before confirming this statement, the current set of results presented in this paper seem to clearly imply that once the stochastic bias upto $\mathcal{O}(\mu^4)$ is eliminated by considering the necessary unbiased powers of $D_n$ upto $n=4$ using unbiased exponential resummation, the resummation results work very well and agree with the Taylor-ed estimates of charge cumulants of at least upto eighth orders. More importantly, this observation holds true more or less for all the three working temperatures in this paper, which are subtly selected so that they encompass a large part of the entire QCD phase diagram. This finding also remains true irrespective of whether or not, one calculates unbiased powers of the higher $D_n$ from $n=5$ onwards. So, this may possibly imply that owing to the ultraviolet divergences remaining upto $\mathcal{O}(\mu^4)$, it is only these first four correlation functions which impacts the resulting calculations maximally and therefore must be treated in an unbiased manner for procuring the behaviour of the true infinite Taylor series and for conducting a more transparent genuine probe into QCD at finite chemical potential.

We have also investigated the zeros of the gauge-ensemble average phasefactor and found that barring some exceptions at $176$ MeV, the onset of these zeros provide agreeable indications regarding the estimates of the radius of convergence and the domain of validity of the resummation results, before encountering breakdown. Apart from baryochemical potentials, this also holds true for isospin chemical potentials where we have proposed a new formula for a non-trivial phasefactor which varies with complex $\muI$ by considering complex $\muI$. We also demonstrated the nature of the overlap problem with $\muI$ and illustrated that the onset of the zeros of this newly proposed phasefactor is more or less consistent with this problem and this overlap problem becomes severely large, with excessively high errorbars beyond the point of this onset of zeros.

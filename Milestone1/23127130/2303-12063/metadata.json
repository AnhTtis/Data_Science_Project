    "abstract": "The recently introduced unbiased exponential resummation at finite chemical potential has become an important approach which promises to capture the higher order Taylor coefficients reliably appearing otherwise in the finite-density QCD Taylor series of thermodynamic observables. In this paper, we present a detailed comparative study between the usual Taylor coefficients upto eighth order and the corresponding estimates of the same coefficients obtained using unbiased exponential resummation at finite baryon and isospin chemical potentials. We also subsequently compare the different estimates of radius of convergence obtained from the Taylor expansion and the same procured from the unbiased exponential resummation scheme. We propose a new method of finding a non-trivial phasefactor estimate for isospin chemical potential and we attempt to explain the values of these different estimates of radius of convergence by observing the onset of zeroes of this gauge-ensemble average phasefactor for both baryon and isospin chemical potentials. Lastly, we also illustrate kurtosis plots describing the behaviour of overlap problem in isospin chemical potential and check if it maintains consistency with the appearance of zeros of the proposed phasefactor estimate for isospin chemical potential.",

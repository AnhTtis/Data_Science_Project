    "abstract": "A Kondo lattice is often electrically insulating at low temperatures. However, several recent experiments have detected signatures of bulk metallicity within this Kondo insulating phase. Here we visualize the real-space charge landscape within a Kondo lattice with atomic resolution using a scanning tunneling microscope. We discover nanometer-scale puddles of metallic conduction electrons centered around uranium-site substitutions in the heavy-fermion compound URu$_2$Si$_2$, and around samarium-site defects in the topological Kondo insulator SmB$_6$. These defects disturb the Kondo screening cloud, leaving behind a fingerprint of the metallic parent state. Our results suggest that the mysterious 3D quantum oscillations measured in SmB$_6$ could arise from these Kondo-lattice defects, although we cannot rule out other explanations. Our imaging technique could enable the development of atomic-scale charge sensors using heavy-fermion probes.",

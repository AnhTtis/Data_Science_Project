\paragraph{Conclusion}
By employing entropy dissipation of the MVE, we design a potential function for a hypothesis velocity field such that it controls the KL divergence between the corresponding hypothesis solution and the ground truth, for any time stamp within the period of interest.
Built on this potential, we proposed the \EINN\ method for MVEs with NN and derived the detailed computation method of the stochastic gradient, using the classic adjoint method. Through empirical studies on examples of the 2D NSE and the 3D MVE with Coulomb interactions, we show the significant advantage of the proposed method, when compared with two SOTA NN based MVE solvers.

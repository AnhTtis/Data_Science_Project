\paragraph{Conclusion}
By employing entropy dissipation of the McKean-Vlasov system, we design a self-consistency potential function for a hypothesis velocity field such that it controls the KL divergence between the corresponding hypothesis solution and the ground truth, for any time stamp within the period of interest.
Built on this self-consistency potential, we proposed a neural network based MVE solver and derived the detailed computation method of the stochastic gradient, using the classic adjoint method. Through empirical studies on examples of the 2D Navier-Stokes equation and the 3D McKean-Vlasov equation with Coulomb interactions, we show the significant advantage of the proposed method, when compared with two SOTA NN based PDE solvers.

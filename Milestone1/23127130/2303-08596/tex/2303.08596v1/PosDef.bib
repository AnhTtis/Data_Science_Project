@article{LisAT,
	abstract = {{We generalize the switching lemma of Griffiths, Hurst, and Sherman to the random current representation of the Ashkin--Teller model. We then use it together with properties of two-dimensional topology to derive linear relations for multipoint boundary spin correlations and bulk order--disorder correlations in planar models. We also show that the same linear relations are satisfied by products of Pfaffians. As a result, a clear picture arises in the noninteracting case of two independent Ising models where multipoint correlation functions are given by Pfaffians and determinants of their respective two-point functions. This gives a unified treatment of both the classical Pfaffian identities and recent total positivity inequalities for boundary spin correlations in the planar Ising model. We also derive the Simon and Gaussian inequalities for general Ashkin--Teller models with negative four-body coupling constants.}},

@article{Lammers,
	abstract = {The interest is in models of integer-valued height functions on shift-invariant planar graphs whose maximum degree is three. We prove delocalisation for models induced by convex nearest-neighbour potentials, under the condition that each potential function is an excited potential, that is, a convex symmetric potential function V with the property that {\$}{\$}V({$\backslash$}pm 1){$\backslash$}le V(0)+{$\backslash$}log 2{\$}{\$}. Examples of such models include the discrete Gaussian and solid-on-solid models at inverse temperature {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}beta {$\backslash$}le {$\backslash$}log 2{\$}{\$}, as well as the uniformly random K-Lipschitz function for fixed {\$}{\$}K{$\backslash$}in {\{}{$\backslash$}mathbb {\{}N{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}. In fact, {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}beta V{\$}{\$}is an excited potential for any convex symmetric potential function V whenever {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}beta {\$}{\$}is sufficiently small. To arrive at the result, we develop a new technique for symmetry breaking, and then study the geometric percolation properties of sets of the form {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}{\{}{$\backslash$}varphi {$\backslash$}ge a{$\backslash$}{\}}{\$}{\$}and {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}{\{}{$\backslash$}varphi {$\backslash$}le a{$\backslash$}{\}}{\$}{\$}, where {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}varphi {\$}{\$}is the random height function and a a constant. Along the same lines, we derive delocalisation for models induced by convex symmetric nearest-neighbour potentials which force the parity of the height of neighbouring vertices to be distinct. This includes models of uniformly random graph homomorphisms on the honeycomb lattice and the truncated square tiling, as well as on the same graphs with each edge replaced by N edges linked in series. The latter resembles cable-graph constructions which appear in the analysis of the Gaussian free field.},

In particular, we prove that phase transitions occur in (φ·φ)32quantum field theories and classical, isotropic Heisenberg models in 3 or more dimensions. The central element of the proof is that for fixed ferromagnetic nearest neighbor coupling, the absolutely continuous part of the two point function ink space is bounded by 0(k−2). When applicable, our results can be fairly accurate numerically. For example, our lower bounds on the critical temperature in the three dimensional Ising (resp. classical Heisenberg) model agrees with that obtained by high temperature expansions to within 14{\%} (resp. a factor of 9{\%}).},

	abstract = {We consider loop-erased random walk (LERW) running between two boundary points of a square grid approximation of a planar simply connected domain. The LERW Green's function is the probability that the LERW passes through a given edge in the domain. We prove that this probability, multiplied by the inverse mesh size to the power 3/4, converges in the lattice size scaling limit to (a constant times) an explicit conformally covariant quantity which coincides with the {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}hbox {\{}SLE{\}}{\_}2{\$}{\$}SLE2Green's function. The proof does not use SLE techniques and is based on a combinatorial identity which reduces the problem to obtaining sharp asymptotics for two quantities: the loop measure of random walk loops of odd winding number about a branch point near the marked edge and a ``spinor''observable for random walk started from one of the vertices of the marked edge.},

	abstract = {A matrix is called totally positive (resp. totally nonnegative) if all its minors are positive (resp. nonnegative). Consider the Ising model with free boundary conditions and no external field on a planar graph G. Let {\$}{\$}a{\_}1,{$\backslash$}dots ,a{\_}k,b{\_}k,{$\backslash$}dots ,b{\_}1{\$}{\$}a1,⋯,ak,bk,⋯,b1be vertices placed in a counterclockwise order on the outer face of G. We show that the {\$}{\$}k{$\backslash$}times k{\$}{\$}k×kmatrix of the two-point spin correlation functions {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}begin{\{}aligned{\}} M{\_}{\{}i,j{\}} = {$\backslash$}langle {$\backslash$}sigma {\_}{\{}a{\_}i{\}} {$\backslash$}sigma {\_}{\{}b{\_}j{\}} {$\backslash$}rangle {$\backslash$}end{\{}aligned{\}}{\$}{\$}Mi,j=⟨σaiσbj⟩is totally nonnegative. Moreover, {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}det M > 0{\$}{\$}detM>0if and only if there exist k pairwise vertex-disjoint paths that connect {\$}{\$}a{\_}i{\$}{\$}aiwith {\$}{\$}b{\_}i{\$}{\$}bi. We also compute the scaling limit at criticality of the probability that there are k parallel and disjoint connections between {\$}{\$}a{\_}i{\$}{\$}aiand {\$}{\$}b{\_}i{\$}{\$}biin the double random current model. Our results are based on a new distributional relation between double random currents and random alternating flows of Talaska {$[$}37{$]$}.},

	abstract = {The known Pfaffian structure of the boundary spin correlations, and more generally order--disorder correlation functions, is given a new explanation through simple topological considerations within the model's random current representation. This perspective is then employed in the proof that the Pfaffian structure of boundary correlations emerges asymptotically at criticality in Ising models on {\$}{\$}{\{}{$\backslash$}mathbb {\{}Z{\}}{\}}\^{}2{\$}{\$}Z2with finite-range interactions. The analysis is enabled by new results on the stochastic geometry of the corresponding random currents. The proven statement establishes an aspect of universality, seen here in the emergence of fermionic structures in two dimensions beyond the solvable cases.},

As a consequence, we obtain a simple exact formula for the scaling limit of the energy field one-point function in terms of the hyperbolic metric.

The analysis also applies to higher dimensions, for which the result is already known, and to systems with interactions of power law decay. The proof employs in an essential way an extension of the Ising model's random current representation to the model's infinite volume limit. Using it, we relate the continuity of the magnetization to the vanishing of the free boundary condition Gibbs state's long range order parameter. For reflection positive models the resulting criterion for continuity may be established through the infrared bound for all but the borderline lower dimensional cases. The exclusion applies to the one dimensional model with 1/r                2 interaction for which the spontaneous magnetization is known to be discontinuous at T                                  c                .},

@article{Cimasoni,
	abstract = {The Kac-Ward formula allows the Ising partition function to be 
	  computed on a planar graph G with straight edges from the determinant of 
		  a matrix of size 2N, where N denotes the number of edges of G. In 
		  this paper, we extend this formula to any finite graph: the 
		  partition function can be written as an alternating sum of the 
		  determinants of 2(2g) matrices of size 2N, where g is the genus of 
		  an orientable surface in which G embeds. We give two proofs of this 
		  generalized formula. The first one is purely combinatorial, while 
		  the second relies on the Fisher-Kasteleyn reduction of the Ising 
		  model to the dimer model, and on geometric techniques. As a 
		  consequence of this second proof, we also obtain the following fact: 
		  the Kac-Ward and the Fisher-Kasteleyn methods for solving the Ising 
		  model are one and the same.},

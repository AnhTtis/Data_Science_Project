    "abstract": "We introduce the notion of a multidimensional hybrid preference domain on a (finite) set of alternatives that is a Cartesian product of finitely many components. We demonstrate that in a model of public goods provision, multidimensional hybrid preferences arise naturally through assembling marginal preferences under the condition of semi-separability - a weakening of separability. We then study strategy-proof rules on this domain and show that every such rule can be decomposed into component-wise strategy-proof rules. More importantly, we show that under a suitable \"richness\" condition, every domain of preferences that reconciles decomposability with strategy-proofness must be a multidimensional hybrid domain.",

    "abstract": "We present the first measurement of the mass function of free-floating planets (FFP) or very wide orbit planets down to an Earth mass, based on microlensing data from the MOA-II survey in 2006-2014. The shortest duration event has an Einstein radius crossing time of $t_{\\rm E} = 0.057\\pm 0.016\\,$days and an angular Einstein radius of $θ_{\\rm E} = 0.90\\pm 0.14\\,μ$as. There are seven short events with $t_{\\rm E}<0.5$ day, which are likely to be due to planets. The detection efficiency for short events depends on both $t_{\\rm E}$ and $θ_{\\rm E}$, and we measure this with image-level simulations for the first time. These short events can be well modeled by a power-law mass function, $dN_4/d\\log M = (2.18^{+0.52}_{-1.40})\\times (M/8\\,M_\\oplus)^{-α_4}$ dex$^{-1}$star$^{-1}$ with$α_4 = 0.96^{+0.47}_{-0.27}$ for $M/M_\\odot < 0.02$. This implies a total of $f= 21^{+23}_{-13}$ FFP or wide orbit planets in the mass range $0.33<M/M_\\oplus< 6660$ per star, with a total FFP mass of $m = 80^{+73}_{-47} M_\\oplus$ per star. The number of FFP is $19_{-13}^{+23}$ times the number of planets in wide orbits (beyond the snow line), while the total masses are of the same order. This suggests that the FFPs have been ejected from bound planetary systems that may have had an initial mass function with a power-law index of $α\\sim 0.9$, which would imply a total number of $22_{-13}^{+23}$ planets star$^{-1}$ and a total mass of $171_{-52}^{+80} M_\\oplus$ star$^{-1}$.",

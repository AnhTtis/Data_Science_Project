\section{Conclusion}
This work introduces CroSel, a novel partial-label learning method that leverages historical prediction to select confident pseudo labels from candidate label sets. The proposed method consists of two parts: a cross selection strategy that enables two models to select ``true" labels for each other, and a consistency regularization term co-mix that avoids sample waste and tiny noise caused by false selection. Empirically, extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of CroSel, which consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmark datasets.

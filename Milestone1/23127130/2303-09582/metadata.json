    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the homogeneous coordinate rings $A(Y_{n,d}) \\cong \\mathbb{K}[Ω_{n,d}]$ of monomial projections $Y_{n,d}$ of Veronese varieties parameterized by subsets $Ω_{n,d}$ of monomials of degree $d$ in $n+1$ variables where: (1) $Ω_{n,d}$ contains all monomials supported in at most $s$ variables and, (2) $Ω_{n,d}$ is a set of monomial invariants of a finite diagonal abelian group $G \\subset GL(n+1,\\mathbb{K})$ of order $d$. Our goal is to study when $\\mathbb{K}[Ω_{n,d}]$ is a quadratic algebra and, if so, when $\\mathbb{K}[Ω_{n,d}]$ is Koszul or G-quadratic. For the family (1), we prove that $\\mathbb{K}[Ω_{n,d}]$ is quadratic when $s \\ge \\lceil \\frac{n+2}{2} \\rceil$. For the family (2), we completely characterize when $\\mathbb{K}[Ω_{2,d}]$ is quadratic in terms of the group $G \\subset GL(3,\\mathbb{K})$, and we prove that $\\mathbb{K}[Ω_{2,d}]$ is quadratic if and only if it is Koszul. We also provide large families of examples where $\\mathbb{K}[Ω_{n,d}]$ is G-quadratic.",

\begin{abstract}
  Analytic mathematical models for the static spin ($G_-$) and density ($G_+$) local field factors for the uniform electron gas (UEG) as functions of wavevector and density are presented.
  These models closely fit recent quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) data and satisfy exact asymptotic limits.
  This model for $G_-$ is available for the first time, and the present model for $G_+$ is an improvement over previous work.
  The QMC-computed $G_\pm$ are consistent with a rapid crossover between theoretically-derived small-$q$ and large-$q$ expansions of $G_\pm$.
  These expansions are completely determined by $\rs$, the UEG correlation energy per electron, and the UEG on-top pair distribution function.
  We demonstrate their utility by computing uniform electron gas correlation energies over a range of densities.
  These models, which hold over an extremely wide range of densities, are recommended for use in practical time-dependent density functional theory calculations of simple metallic systems.
  A revised model of the spin susceptibility enhancement is developed that fits QMC data, and does not show a ferromagnetic instability at low density.

\maketitle

A critical quantity for evaluating the linear response of an interacting uniform electron gas (UEG), or simple metal, are the local field factors (LFFs) $G_\pm(\rs,q,\omega)$.
The UEG (sometimes called jellium) can be characterized by a Wigner-Seitz density parameter $\rs = [3/(4\pi n)]^{1/3}$ and relative spin-polarization $\zeta = (\nup - \ndn)/n$, for total density $n = \nup + \ndn$.
The density (spin-symmetric) LFF $G_+(\rs,q,\omega)$ governs the density-density response $\chi(q,\omega)$ of a many-electron density to a wavevector $q$- and frequency $\omega$-dependent perturbation via \cite{giuliani2005}
\begin{equation}
  \chi^{-1}(q,\omega) = \chi_0^{-1}(q,\omega)
  - \frac{4\pi}{q^2}\left[1 - G_+(\rs,q,\omega) \right].
\end{equation}
$\chi_0(q,\omega)$ is the response function of non-interaction electrons; for the UEG, this is the Lindhard function \cite{lindhard1954}.
Thus $G_+$ is related to the exchange-correlation kernel $f\suxc$ of time-dependent density functional theory \cite{runge1984,gross1985} as $G_+(\rs,q,\omega) = -q^2 f\suxc(\rs,q,\omega)/(4\pi)$.
The spin (antisymmetric) LFF governs the paramagnetic spin-response via \cite{giuliani2005}
\begin{equation}
  \chi_{S_z S_z}^{-1}(q,\omega) = \chi_0^{-1}(q,\omega)
  + \frac{4\pi}{q^2} G_-(\rs,q,\omega).
\end{equation}
There exist many approximate expressions of $G_+$ or $f\suxc$, which range from those which are local in space and time \cite{zangwill1980}, nonlocal in space only (as in this work) \cite{corradini1998}, nonlocal in time only \cite{gross1985,qian2002}, or nonlocal in both space and time \cite{richardson1994,ruzsinszky2020,kaplan2022}.
However, there are no \emph{realistic} expressions of $G_-$ other than that of Richardson and Ashcroft (RA) \cite{richardson1994}, which is based on perturbation theory calculations, and is complicated by typographical errors.
As we make extensive comparisons to the RA LFFs, we correct these typographical errors in Supplemental Material Sec. \ref{sec:RA_corrected}.
The RA LFFs are presumably most realistic at higher densities typical of simple metals, and less realistic at lower densities.

This work provides flexible, analytic expressions for the static LFFs $G_\pm(\rs,q)\equiv \lim_{\omega \to 0} G_\pm(\rs,q,\omega)$ based on known asymptotic limits.
Free parameters are then fitted to recent variational diagrammatic quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations \cite{kukkonen2021}.
This QMC data covers the region below $q = 2.34 \kf$ for $\rs =1-5$ for $G_-$, but is only available for $\rs=1$ \& 2 for $G_+$.
The current model of $G_+(\rs,q)$ also more reliably fits older QMC data \cite{moroni1995} that covers $\rs = 2, 5,$ \& 10, but with no data below $\kf$, than the expression due to Corradini \textit{et al.} \cite{corradini1998}, and provides accurate predictions of the UEG correlation energy.

Both $G_\pm(\rs,q)$ are characterized by a rapid crossover between small- and large-$q$ asymptotics near $q = 2 \kf$, with $\kf = (3\pi^2 n)^{1/3}$ the Fermi wavevector.
This crossover is likely responsible for the ``$2\kf$-hump'' phenomenon.

In this brief paper, we present the formulas for $G_+$ and $G_-$ for all wave vectors given only the density $\rs$.
The details of the curve fitting, asymptotic behavior, and code are given in the Supplemental Material.
The formulas may look complex, but are simple to implement computationally; a Python implementation is provided in the public code repository \cite{code_repo}.

The QMC data for both $G_+$ and $G_-$ closely follow the theoretical asymptotic behavior of varying as $q^2$ at small $q$.
The coefficients of $q^2$ are determined by the compressibility and susceptibility sum rules.
The QMC data rises somewhat faster than $q^2$ to about $2\kf$, and then falls rapidly.
Theory predicts that the large-$q$ behavior of $G_\pm$ is $B_\pm + C q^2$.
Although $B_+$ and $B_-$ differ, they are determined by $\rs$ and the on-top pair correlation function.
$C$ is the same for both $G_\pm$.

The fitting process, partially described below, simply allows the small-$q$ behavior to rise above $q^2$, combined with an adjustable exponential cutoff near $2\kf$.
This cutoff modulates the transition to the large $q$ asymptotics.
The recent QMC data stops at $2.34 \kf$, but is consistent with the large-$q$ asymptotic behavior, assuming a simple transition.
The following equations completely specify the local field factors.

Let $x \equiv q/\kf$, then we model \textit{both} $G_\pm$ as
\begin{align}
  & G_j(\rs,q) =
    x^2\left[A_j(\rs) + \alpha_j(\rs) x^4 \right]
    H\left(x^4/16; a_{3j}, a_{4j} \right)
    \nonumber \\
  & + \left[C(\rs)x^2 + B_j(\rs) \right]
    \left[ 1 - H\left(x^4/16; a_{3j}, a_{4j} \right) \right],
    \label{eq:g_app} \\
  & \alpha_j(\rs) = a_{0j} + a_{1j} \exp(-a_{2j} \rs),
\end{align}
where $j = +, \, -$.
The smoothed step function
\begin{equation}
  H(y; \beta,\gamma) = \frac{\left(e^{\beta \gamma} -1 \right)e^{-\beta y}}{1 + \left(e^{\beta \gamma} - 2 \right)e^{-\beta y} }
\end{equation}
is constructed to satisfy three limits: $H(0;\beta,\gamma) = 0$; $H(\gamma;\beta,\gamma)=1/2$; and $H(\infty;\beta,\gamma)=0$.
While $H$ has no physical basis, it represents a simple and reasonable transition from the low-$q$ behavior of the QMC data to the large-$q$ asymptotics.
The $a_{ij}$ parameters are fitted to QMC data.

Equation (\ref{eq:g_app}) satisfies the exact small-$q$ expansions (SQEs) of $G_\pm$, which are identical in structure.
For $G_+$, this is the compressibility sum rule:
\begin{align}
  \lim_{q \to 0} G_+(\rs,q) &= A_+(\rs) x^2 + \mathcal{O}(x^4), \label{eq:gp_small_q} \\
  A_+(\rs) &= -\frac{\kf^2}{4\pi} \frac{\partial^2 e\suxc^\text{LDA}}{\partial n^2}(\rs),
\end{align}
with $e\suxc^\text{LDA}$ the local-density approximation \cite{dirac1930,kohn1965,perdew1992} for the UEG exchange-correlation energy density.
Unless specified, we use Hartree atomic units, $\hbar = m_e = e^2 =1$; 1 Hartree energy unit is 2 Rydberg, 27.211386 eV; 1 bohr length unit is 0.529177 \AA{} \cite{unit_data}.
The SQE of $G_-$ is the susceptibility sum rule \cite{giuliani2005}:
\begin{align}
  \lim_{q \to 0} G_-(\rs,q) &= A_-(\rs) x^2 + \mathcal{O}(x^4),
  \label{eq:gm_small_q} \\
  A_-(\rs) &= - \frac{3 \pi}{4 \kf}\frac{\partial^2 \varepsilon^\text{LSDA}\suxc}{\partial \zeta^2}(\rs,0).
  \label{eq:a_minus}
\end{align}
For simple polynomial approximations of $A_\pm(\rs)$ valid for $1 \leq \rs \leq 5$, see Eqs. (6) and (7) of Ref. \cite{kukkonen2021}.
$\varepsilon^\text{LSDA}\suxc$ is the local spin-density approximation for the UEG exchange-correlation energy per electron, for which we use the Perdew-Wang approximation \cite{perdew1992}.
The quantity
\begin{equation}
  \alpha\suxc(\rs) \equiv \frac{\partial^2 \varepsilon^\text{LSDA}\suxc}{\partial \zeta^2}(\rs,0)
\end{equation}
is often called the spin-stiffness \cite{vosko1980}.
The exchange contribution to the spin-stiffness can be shown to be $\alpha\sux(\rs) = -\kf/(3\pi)$ \cite{dirac1930,kohn1965,oliver1979}.

Equation (\ref{eq:g_app}) also satisfies the large-$q$ expansions (LQEs) of $G_\pm$, again identical in structure.
For $G_+$, \cite{corradini1998}
\begin{align}
  \lim_{q \to \infty} G_+(\rs,q) &= C(\rs) x^2 + B_+(\rs) + \mathcal{O}(x^{-2}),
  \label{eq:gp_large_q} \\
  C(\rs) &= -\frac{\pi}{2\kf} \frac{\partial}{\partial \rs}
  \left[ \rs \varepsilon^\text{LDA}\suc(\rs)\right].
\end{align}
The function $B_+(\rs)$ is parameterized as \cite{moroni1995}
\begin{equation}
  B_+(\rs) = \frac{1 + (2.15) \rs^{1/2} + (0.435) \rs^{3/2}}{3 + (1.57) \rs^{1/2} + (0.409) \rs^{3/2}}.
\end{equation}
The LQEs of $G_-$ and $G_+$ are connected as \cite{richardson1994,niklasson1974,zhu1984,giuliani2005}
\begin{align}
  \lim_{q\to \infty} G_-(\rs,q) &= C(\rs) x^2 + B_-(\rs) + \mathcal{O}(x^{-2}),
  \label{eq:gm_large_q} \\
  B_-(\rs) &= B_+(\rs) + 2g(\rs) - 1, \label{eq:bminus}
\end{align}
i.e., they differ only by the on-top pair distribution function $g(\rs)$, which we approximate as \cite{perdew1992b}
\begin{equation}
  g(\rs) = \frac{1}{2} \frac{1 + 2 (0.193) \rs}{\{1 + (0.525) \rs[1 + (0.193) \rs]\}^2}.
\end{equation}

\end{table}

To fit Eq. (\ref{eq:g_app}) for $G_\pm$, we minimize the deviation from the QMC-computed values of $G_\pm$, weighted by their corresponding uncertainties.
The fitting method is described fully in Supplemental Material Sec. \ref{sec:fit_method}.
Table \ref{tab:fpars} presents fitted parameters $a_{ij}$.

Figure \ref{fig:gplus_rs_2} compares our fitted $G_+$ to the data of Ref. \cite{kukkonen2021} and to the older QMC data of Moroni \textit{et al.} \cite{moroni1995} for $\rs = 2$.
The quality of fit is excellent, lying within the uncertainty of the QMC data at all computed points.
The LFF of Corradini \textit{et al.} \cite{corradini1998}, although fitted to the Moroni \textit{et al.} data, fits it poorly.
The LFF developed here, fitted to the Moroni \textit{et al.} data at $\rs = 5$ and 10 only, fits it rather well.

  Panel (a) presents $G_+$ and (b) $4\pi G_+ (\kf/q)^2 = \kf^2 f\suxc(q)$.

  \label{fig:gplus_rs_2}
\end{figure}

The Supplemental Material presents further plots of $G_+$ that demonstrate the quality of fit to the data of Refs. \cite{kukkonen2021,moroni1995} in Figs. \ref{fig:gp_rs_1}--\ref{fig:gp_rs_10}.
Supplemental Figs. \ref{fig:gp_rs_0p1}--\ref{fig:gp_rs_100} show that our model realistically extrapolates to values of $\rs$ for which there are no QMC data.
For surface plots of $G_+$ at metallic densities, see Figs. \ref{fig:surf_gp_corr} and \ref{fig:surf_gp_ras}.
At a very high density, $\rs = 0.1$ in Fig. \ref{fig:gp_rs_0p1}, our model and the RA $G_+(\rs,q)$ exhibit very similar behaviors: a simple interpolation between small- and large-$q$ asymptotics with a hump near $2\kf$.
At a very low density, $\rs = 100$ in Fig. \ref{fig:gp_rs_100}, our model tends to a smooth, hump-free interpolation between the two regimes, but the RA $G_+$ exhibits likely unphysical oscillations.
This latter behavior of RA is consistent with its derivation from perturbation theory.

Moreover, from Figs. \ref{fig:gplus_rs_2} and \ref{fig:gp_rs_1}--\ref{fig:gp_rs_10}, one can see that the QMC data validates the theoretically-derived asymptotic expansions in the small-$q$ limit, and is also consistent with the large-$q$ limit.
This is direct validation of the compressibility sum rule.
All parameters in $G_+(\rs,q)$ are completely determined by $\rs$ and the UEG correlation energy per electron.

Figure \ref{fig:eps_c_err} plots the errors in the UEG correlation energies computed using this model and a few common approximations for $G_+$.
The model of this work systematically overestimates the correlation energies, but makes errors comparable to any of the LFFs presented there.
More accurate correlation energies require a frequency-dependent $G_+(\rs,q,\omega)$, such as those of Refs. \citenum{richardson1994,ruzsinszky2020,kaplan2022}.
The method of computation is described in Supplemental Material Sec. \ref{sec:eps_c_method}, and a validation of our method using the random phase approximation (RPA, $G_+^\text{RPA}=0$) is given in Supplemental Table \ref{tab:RPA_sanity}.

\begin{figure}

  \caption{Percent deviation (PD) from the Perdew-Wang approximation \cite{perdew1992} of the UEG correlation energy, using a few common approximations for $G_+$.
  We define the PD as $(100\%)\left[1 - \varepsilon\suc^\text{approx}/\varepsilon\suc^\text{PW92} \right]$.
  The solid blue curve is computed using Eq. (\ref{eq:g_app}) and Table \ref{tab:fpars}.
  The dashed red curve is the static limit of the RA LFF \cite{richardson1994}, and the dotted red curve is its frequency-dependent form.
  The dash-dotted gray curve is due to Ref. \cite{corradini1998}, and the solid orange curve to Ref. \cite{kaplan2022}.
  The numeric integration for both variants of the RA LFF appears to become unstable for $\rs \gtrsim 45$.

\end{figure}

Last, Fig. \ref{fig:gminus_rs_4} compares our fitted $G_-$ to the Kukkonen-Chen QMC data \cite{kukkonen2021} for $\rs = 4$.
The quality of fit is again excellent, lying within the QMC uncertainties at all points.
The transition between small- and large-$q$ asymptotics is apparent from Fig. \ref{fig:gminus_rs_4}(b).
Equation (\ref{eq:g_app}) avoids the unusual oscillations present in the RA LFF, which is a rational polynomial in $q^2$.

\begin{figure}

  Panel (a) presents $G_-$ and (b) $4\pi G_-(\kf/q)^2$.
  The static RA \cite{richardson1994} LFF is also shown (red, dashed).
  The small-$q$ expansion (SQE) of Eq. (\ref{eq:gm_small_q}) (orange, dotted) and the large-$q$ expansion (LQE) of Eq. (\ref{eq:gm_large_q}) (green, dotted) are also shown.
  }
  \label{fig:gminus_rs_4}
\end{figure}

Supplemental Figs. \ref{fig:gm_rs_1}--\ref{fig:gm_rs_5} demonstrate the high quality of fit to $G_-(\rs,q)$ at other values of $\rs \in \{ 1,2, 3,5\}$.
Extrapolations to the same high, $\rs = 0.1$, and low, $\rs = 100$, densities are made in Figs. \ref{fig:gm_rs_0p1} and \ref{fig:gm_rs_100}, respectively.
The same conclusions regarding $G_+$ hold for $G_-$: our model and RA's are consistent at high densities, but RA's model becomes unphysically oscillatory at low densities.
For surface plots of $G_-$ at metallic densities, see Fig. \ref{fig:surf_gm_ras}.

These figures also show that the QMC data validates the asymptotic expansions of $G_-$, and thus the spin-susceptibility sum rule.
Note that $G_-(\rs,q)$ depends on the parameters of $G_+(\rs,q)$ and the UEG on-top pair distribution function via Eq. (\ref{eq:bminus}).

Last, we discuss the accuracy of the PW92 parameterization of the correlation spin stiffness $\alpha\suc(\rs)$.
It can be observed from either Fig. \ref{fig:chi_enh} or Table \ref{tab:chi_enh} that the enhancement of the interacting spin-susceptibility $\chi_s$, over the non-interacting spin-susceptibility $\chi_s^{(0)}$ (both per unit volume),
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\chi_s}{\chi_s^{(0)}} = \left\{ 1 + \frac{3}{\kf^2} \alpha\suxc(\rs) \right\}^{-1}
  \label{eq:chi_enh},
\end{equation}
predicted by PW92 is not consistent with QMC calculations for $\rs > 10$ bohr \cite{chen2019,kukkonen2021}.
For all applications besides low-density jellium, extensive tests have shown PW92 to be robust.
In units of the electron spin moment, $\chi_s^{(0)} = 3n/\kf^2$.
Recent QMC calculations of $\chi_s/\chi_s^{(0)}$ and of the UEG correlation energy at low densities \cite{azadi2022} make it possible to accurately fit $\alpha\suc$ directly.
The Perdew-Wang model of $\alpha\suc(\rs)$ is
\begin{align}
  \alpha\suc(\rs) =& 2 A(1 + \alpha_1 \rs)
    \label{eq:alpha_c_pw92} \\
  & \times \ln \left[1 + \frac{1}{2A(\beta_1 \rs^{1/2}
  + \beta_2 \rs + \beta_3 \rs^{3/2} + \beta_4 \rs^2)} \right],
  \nonumber
\end{align}
where $A$, $\beta_1$, and $\beta_2$ are constrained to ensure the analytic high-density expansion \cite{vosko1980}
\begin{equation}
  \lim_{\rs \to 0} \alpha\suc(\rs) \approx -\frac{1}{6\pi^2} \ln \rs
    + 0.035474401.
\end{equation}
We have recomputed the constant term.
To refit $\alpha\suc$, we minimized the deviation from the tabulated values of the susceptibility enhancement \cite{chen2019,kukkonen2021}, and from approximate values of the spin stiffness at low densities \cite{azadi2022}.
See Supplemental Material Sec. \ref{sec:fit_method} for a description of this method.
Table \ref{tab:alpha_c_rev} presents fitted parameters and expansion coefficients.
Our parameterization is recommended only for applications where higher precision of $\alpha\suc(\rs > 10)$ is needed: our model and PW92 appear to differ at most by about 3.3\% at $\rs = 18.3$ bohr.
We still use the PW92 parameterization of $\alpha\suc$ in our model $G_-$ via Eq. (\ref{eq:a_minus}).

Consistent with recent QMC-driven analyses of the low-density phases of the UEG \cite{holzmann2020,azadi2022}, our parameterization of $\alpha\suc$ yields no divergence in the susceptibility enhancement.
The present and PW92 parameterizations of $\alpha\suc$ both predict near-divergences in $\chi_s/\chi_s^{(0)}$.
Such a divergence would indicate a ferromagnetic instability in the low-density UEG, whereby a transition from the paramagnetic to ferromagnetic fluid phases is possible.
Both Refs. \cite{holzmann2020} and \cite{azadi2022} find that a transition to a Wigner crystal phase occurs before a transition to the ferromagnetic fluid phase.

In summary, this work presents straightforward analytic models of the static density (spin-symmetric) and spin (antisymmetric) local field factors of the uniform electron gas (UEG), which are fitted to recent QMC data \cite{kukkonen2021}.
These models hold at an extremely wide range of densities, and the model of $G_+$ predicts UEG correlation energies with accuracy sufficient to recommend use in practical calculations of simple metallic systems.
We have also re-parameterized the correlation spin-stiffness of the UEG using QMC data \cite{chen2019,kukkonen2021,azadi2022}, which shows no transition to a ferromagnetic fluid phase.

   \caption{The proposed SOCS is more semantically meaningful, facilitating the learning of correspondence for objects with large shape variations. The coordinates in the canonical space (represented by the color) of the same semantic part in different objects are similar in SOCS (Middle row) and dissimilar in NOCS (Bottom row). Please pay special attention to the highlighted regions.}

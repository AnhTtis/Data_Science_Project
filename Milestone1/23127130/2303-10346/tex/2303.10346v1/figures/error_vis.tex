   \caption{The per-point SOCS estimation error in a cross-section (Bottom row) of the input scene (Top row). The estimation in most of the unseen regions is as accurate as that near the observed surface, showing the necessity of surface-independent sampling and the efficacy of our feature propagation mechanism.}

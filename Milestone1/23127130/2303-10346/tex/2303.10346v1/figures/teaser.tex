   \caption{NOCS~\cite{wang2019normalized}, constructed with globally aligned objects, finds difficulty in handling large intra-category shape variations. In this example, the coordinates regressed against NOCS for the long-lens camera contain much error (w.r.t. the CAD model under ground-truth pose and size) and the resulting pose is incorrect (middle). In contrast, the coordinates regressed against SOCS, built by semantically-guided non-rigid object alignment, are semantically coherent, leading to better pose estimation (right).}

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have presented a method for accurate and robust category-level 6D pose and size estimation based on the novel Semantically-aware Object Coordinate Space (SOCS). Since SOCS is built by non-rigidly aligning objects based on
semantically meaningful correspondences, it is semantically coherent and leads to accurate pose and size estimation under large shape variations. In the future, we would like to investigate techniques to boost the performance of our method on objects with complex symmetry. We would also like to explore applying SOCS to the problem of category-level pose estimation of articulated objects.

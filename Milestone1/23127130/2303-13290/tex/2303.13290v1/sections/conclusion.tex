\section{Conclusion}
This paper presents a distribution consistency-based unsupervised deep probabilistic registration framework. One of the advantages of this method is that it extends the probabilistic registration to handle point cloud registration with partial overlaps by adopting the Sinkhorn algorithm to predict distribution-level correspondences. Moreover, we propose self-consistent, cross-consistent, and local-contrastive losses to train feature extractors in an unsupervised manner. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves the best performance.

%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
% \begin{abstract}
% Despite recent success in incorporating learning into
% point cloud registration, many works focus on learning features and continue to rely on nearest-neighbor
% feature matching and outlier filtering through RANSAC to obtain the final set of correspondences for pose estimation.
% However, these methods heavily rely on such correspondences and meet great challenges with partial overlap. This paper proposes an unsupervised algorithmic framework of probabilistic point cloud registration. Specifically, we first extract pointwise features from both source and target point clouds. We then construct
% a mixed feature set by gathering source and target features, followed by grouping the mixed set into clusters.  We minimize the discrepancy between two distributions of source and target point clouds, with a relational regularization on the learnable latent prior. This regularization penalizes the fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) distance between the latent prior and its corresponding posterior, allowing one to learn a structured prior distribution flexibly.

% \subsection{Paper length}
% Papers, excluding the references section, must be no longer than eight pages in length.
% The references section will not be included in the page count, and there is no limit on the length of the references section.
% For example, a paper of eight pages with two pages of references would have a total length of 10 pages.
% {\bf There will be no extra page charges for \confName\ \confYear.}

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
This paper presents the first attempt to leverage uncertainty quantification from collaborative object detection (COD) to enhance the performance of multiple object tracking (MOT). Our proposed framework, MOT-CUP, employs direct modeling and conformal prediction techniques to quantify the uncertainty in COD. The uncertainty of COD is propogated to the Kalman Filter and the Negative Log Likelihood-based Association Improvement (NLLAI) procedure of MOT. We evaluate MOT-CUP on various CODs and MOT baselines, and demonstrate that our framework significantly improves both the accuracy and uncertainty of the original MOT. Our findings highlight and validate the benefits of incorporating COD uncertainty quantification into MOT algorithms. In future work, we plan to extend our method to popular single-agent MOT benchmarks, such as KITTI and nuscenes, and more MOT baselines.

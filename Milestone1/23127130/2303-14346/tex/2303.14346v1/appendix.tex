% Our MOT-CUP can track more objects, highlighted by red dotted circles.


We show some visualization results of detection, original SORT, and our MOT-CUP on different scenes in Figures~\ref{fig:79},\ref{fig:68},\ref{fig:63},\ref{fig:3},\ref{fig:1}. The collaborative object detector we used here is Upper-bound. In this visualization, green boxes are ground truth bounding boxes, orange boxes are detected bounding boxes, and red boxes are tracklets' bounding boxes as the output of MOT. The numbers beside the red boxes indicate object IDs. Red dotted circles highlight objects where our MOT-CUP outperforms the original SORT. We observe that our MOT-CUP outperforms the original SORT algorithm in association and accuracy. Overall, our results demonstrate the importance of considering uncertainty in MOT.

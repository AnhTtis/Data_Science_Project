\section{Conclusions}
\vspace{\vspaceaftersection}
We present EFEM, a method for 3D instance segmentation that is trained only on shape datasets.  Without requiring any real or simulated scene data, our method can generalize to complex, real world scenes better than existing methods that also require more supervision.

\paragraph{Limitations and future work}
Although we show an encouraging step towards unsupervised 3D instance segmentation by generalizing knowledge directly from a shape collection to a scene, several weaknesses remain. First, our method has a performance drop when the object is significantly occluded.
This is due to our method recognizing objects only via their shape, rather than also reasoning about color or other features. 
Second our current running speed is slow ($\sim$1min per scene) due to the large number of proposals the initialization requires.

    "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the breather solutions for a radially symmetric curl-curl wave equation with double power nonlinearity \\begin{equation*}\n  ρ(x)\\mathbf{u}_{tt}+\\nabla\\times(\\mathbf{M}(x)\\nabla\\times \\mathbf{u})+μ(x)\\mathbf{u}+v_p(x)|\\mathbf{u}|^{p-1}\\mathbf{u}+v_q(x)|\\mathbf{u}|^{q-1}\\mathbf{u}=0 \\end{equation*} where $(x, t)\\in\\mathbb{R}^3\\times\\mathbb{R}$, $\\mathbf{u}: \\mathbb{R}^3\\times\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^3$ is the unknown function, $\\mathbf{M}: \\mathbb{R}^3\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{3\\times3}$ and $ρ, μ, v_p, v_q:\\mathbb{R}^3\\rightarrow (0, +\\infty)$ are radially symmetric coefficient functions, and $1<p<q$. By considering the solutions with a special form $\\mathbf{u}=y(|x|, t)\\frac{x}{|x|}$, we obtain a family of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) parameterized by the radial variable $r=|x|$. Then we use the qualitative analysis method of ODEs to characterize their periodic behaviors, and further analyze the joint effects of the double power nonlinear terms on the minimal period and the maximal amplitude. Finally, under the appropriate conditions on the coefficients, we construct a $2π\\sqrt{ρ(0)/μ(0)}$-periodic breather solution for the original curl-curl wave equation and find such a solution can generate a continuum of phase-shifted breathers.",

    "abstract": "Let $G$ be a closed highly homogeneous subgroup of $S_{\\infty}$ not involving\ncircular orderings. We show that the closure of a conjugacy class from $G$\ncontains a conjugacy class which is comeagre in it. Furthermore, we show that\nthe family of finite partial maps extendable to elements of this conjugacy\nclass has the cofinal amalgamation property. Similar statements are proved for\nautomorphisms of typical ultrahomogeneous partial orderings.",

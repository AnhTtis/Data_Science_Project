    "abstract": "Let $A$ be a unitary ring and let $(\\mathbf{I(A),\\subseteq })$ be the lattice of ideals of the ring $A.$ In this article we will study the property of the lattice $(\\mathbf{I(A),\\subseteq})$ to be Noetherian or not, for various types of rings $A$. In the last section of the article we study certain rings that are not Boolean rings, but all their ideals are idempotent.",

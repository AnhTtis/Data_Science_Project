Protoplanetary disks are the birthplaces of planets and planets come into being as a result of the growth of dust grains.
During their growth, like the baby kicks, dust grains can influence the disk evolution.
We name this novel evolutionary process as "co-evolution of dust grains and protoplanetary disks".
  We performed dust-gas two-fluid non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics simulations taking into account the dust growth and the associated changes in magnetic resistivity.
  We found that the dust growth significantly affects the disk evolution and, once the dust grains sufficiently grow, disk radial profiles converge to nontrivial power laws
 We analytically derive the power laws which are determined only by observable quantities.
  They are applicable to various evolutionary stage of disk and provide a new basis for future studies.

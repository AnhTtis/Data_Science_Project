    "abstract": "We report on the computer implementation for toric geometry in the computer algebra system $\\texttt{OSCAR}$.\n  The main architectural feature of $\\texttt{OSCAR}$ is that its four fundamental tools $\\texttt{Antic}$ (Hecke, Nemo), $\\texttt{GAP}$, $\\texttt{Polymake}$ and $\\texttt{Singular}$ are $\\mathit{integral~components}$, rather than external software. Toric geometry benefits greatly from this architecture.\n  $\\texttt{Julia}$ is a high-performance programming language designed for numerical and scientific computing. The growing ecosystem of $\\texttt{Julia}$ packages ensures its continued viability for scientific computing and data analysis. Indeed, $\\texttt{OSCAR}$ is written in $\\texttt{Julia}$. This implies that the performance of $\\texttt{OSCAR}$ should be comparable or even better than many other implementations.",

This fully relativistic average atom code uses phase shift tracking and an efficient refinement scheme to provide an accurate description of continuum states. The resulting equations of state accurately represent the atomic shell-related features which are absent in Thomas–Fermi-based approaches. We discuss various representations of the exchange potential and some of the ambiguities in the choice of the effective charge Z∗ in average atom models, both of which affect predictions of electrical conductivities and radiative properties.}

abstract={The review is devoted to the elucidation of the basic problems arising in the theoretical investigation of systems with Bose-Einstein condensate. Understanding these challenging problems is necessary for the correct description of Bose-condensed systems. The principal problems considered in the review are as follows: (i) What is the relation between Bose-Einstein condensation and global gauge symmetry breaking? (ii) How to resolve the Hohenberg-Martin dilemma of conserving versus gapless theories? (iii) How to describe Bose-condensed systems in strong spatially random potentials? (iv) Whether thermodynamically anomalous fluctuations in Bose systems are admissible? (v) How to create nonground-statc condensates? Detailed answers to these questions are given in the review. As examples of nonequilibrium condensates, three cases are described: coherent modes, turbulent superfluids, and heterophase fluids.},

title={Plasma stopping-power measurements reveal transition from non-degenerate to degenerate plasmas},
journal={Nature Physics},
year={2020},
month={Apr},

volume={16},
number={4},
pages={432-437},
abstract={Physically realized electron gas systems usually reside in either the quantum non-degenerate or fully degenerate limit, where the average de Broglie wavelength of the thermal electrons becomes comparable with the interparticle distance between electrons. A few systems, such as young brown dwarfs and the cold dense fuels created in imploded cryogenic capsules at the National Ignition Facility, lie between these two limits and are partially degenerate. The National Ignition Facility has the unique capability of varying the electron quantum degeneracy by adjusting the laser drive used to implode the capsules. This allows experimental studies of the effects of the degeneracy level on plasma transport properties. By measuring rare nuclear reactions in these cold dense fuels, we show that the electron stopping power, which is the rate of energy loss per unit distance travelled by a charged particle, changes with increasing electron density. We observe a quantum-induced shift in the peak of the stopping power using diagnostics that measure above and below this peak. The observed changes in the stopping power are shown to be unique to the transition region between non-degenerate and degenerate plasmas. Our results support the screening models applied to partially degenerate astrophysical systems such as young brown dwarfs.},

abstract = {We review recent theoretical and computational developments in time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) for periodic insulators and semiconductors. To capture excitonic effects within a linear-response TDDFT framework requires using exchange–correlation (xc) kernels with a proper long-range behavior, which can be efficiently modeled with a class of so-called long-range corrected xc kernels. While attractive from a computational standpoint, these xc kernels have their limitations and require judicious use. We review the pros and cons of various xc kernels in the literature, and discuss an empirical scaling approach to obtain accurate exciton binding energies with TDDFT. We also discuss generalized TDDFT approaches for excitons using hybrid functionals.}

However, for many predicted properties, there are spectacular failures that can be traced to the delocalization error and static correlation error of commonly used approximations. These errors can be characterized and understood through the perspective of fractional charges and fractional spins introduced recently. Reducing these errors will open new frontiers for applications of density functional theory.}}

journal = {Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter},
abstract = {The phonon dispersion relations and the elastic constants are evaluated for Wigner electron crystals near the critical coupling strength for melting in the fully quantal regime at zero temperature. The structures considered are the body-centred and face-centred cubic lattices in dimensionality D = 3 and the triangular lattice in D = 2. The calculations are based on a density functional approach requiring as input the linear density response function of the fluid phase at freezing and the Debye - Waller factor of the crystal at melting. These are known from quantal Monte Carlo simulations both for D = 3 and for D = 2. Comparison with earlier results of harmonic calculations shows appreciable softening from anharmonicity, which is mainly associated with the exchange and correlation contributions to the effective force constants of the quantal crystal near melting. Mechanical stability of the body-centred cubic electron crystal at melting is demonstrated through a self-consistent calculation of the lattice vibrations and the mean square particle displacement entering the Debye - Waller factor, as well as by calculations of the elastic constants using the methods of long waves and of homogeneous deformations. Finally, a relationship is displayed between phonon dispersion curves in the triangular Wigner crystal near melting and plasmon excitations in the two-dimensional electron fluid near freezing.}

abstract = {Abstract We present high precision Molecular Dynamics simulations for the dynamical structure function, S (k, ω), of the classical Coulomb One Component Plasma (OCP), for a wide range of the coupling parameter Γ (from 0.05 to 10 000). We follow the positive-to-negative transition of the slope of the ω (k) dispersion curve at small wave numbers caused by the onset of correlations with increasing coupling. The high signal-to-noise ratio of the data over several orders of magnitude allows examination of a wide dynamical range of S (k, ω), including extreme values of ω and k, and the identification of waves at higher harmonics of the plasma frequency. Sum rules are found to be accurately satisfied. (© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim)},

abstract={The properties of all materials arise largely from the quantum mechanics of their constituent electrons under the influence of the electric field of the nuclei. The solution of the underlying many-electron Schr{\"o}dinger equation is a `non-polynomial hard' problem, owing to the complex interplay of kinetic energy, electron--electron repulsion and the Pauli exclusion principle. The dominant computational method for describing such systems has been density functional theory. Quantum-chemical methods---based on an explicit ansatz for the many-electron wavefunctions and, hence, potentially more accurate---have not been fully explored in the solid state owing to their computational complexity, which ranges from strongly exponential to high-order polynomial in system size. Here we report the application of an exact technique, full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo to a variety of real solids, providing reference many-electron energies that are used to rigorously benchmark the standard hierarchy of quantum-chemical techniques, up to the `gold standard' coupled-cluster ansatz, including single, double and perturbative triple particle--hole excitation operators. We show the errors in cohesive energies predicted by this method to be small, indicating the potential of this computationally polynomial scaling technique to tackle current solid-state problems.},

abstract="After an overall introduction into the neutron star physics, we begin a systematic description of neutron star layers (Fig. 1.2). Chapters 2--4 are devoted to neutron star envelopes. These envelopes are non-uniform. The structure of an envelope for a star with the effective surface temperature ∼ 106 K is schematically shown in Fig. 2.1. We indicate characteristic densities and geometrical depths of interfaces between adjoining layers. One can distinguish the atmosphere, the ocean of ion liquid, followed by solidified layers denoted as the outer and inner crusts. At the bottom of the envelope there may be a mantle containing a liquid crystal of nonspherical nuclei ({\textsection}3.7.2). These layers are already outlined in {\textsection}1.3.1 and will be studied in more detail below. The properties of the atmosphere, ocean, and the upper edge of the solidified layer strongly depend on temperature. For the assumed surface temperature ∼ 106 K the internal temperature of a cooling (isolated) star would be ∼ 108 K; the main temperature gradient would occur in the ocean, while deeper layers would be nearly isothermal. When the star cools, the atmosphere and the ocean become thinner. In a sufficiently cold star they may be absent and the solidified matter will extend to the very surface.",

abstract = {The phase diagram of high-pressure hydrogen is of great interest for fundamental research, planetary physics, and energy applications. A first-order phase transition in the fluid phase between a molecular insulating fluid and a monoatomic metallic fluid has been predicted. The existence and precise location of the transition line is relevant for planetary models. Recent experiments reported contrasting results about the location of the transition. Theoretical results based on density functional theory are also very scattered. We report highly accurate coupled electron–ion Monte Carlo calculations of this transition, finding results that lie between the two experimental predictions, close to that measured in diamond anvil cell experiments but at 25–30 GPa higher pressure. The transition along an isotherm is signaled by a discontinuity in the specific volume, a sudden dissociation of the molecules, a jump in electrical conductivity, and loss of electron localization.}}

abstract={The study of matter under extreme densities and temperatures as they occur, for example, in astrophysical objects and nuclear fusion applications has emerged as one of the most active frontiers in physics, material science, and related disciplines. In this context, a key quantity is given by the dynamic structure factor S(q, $\omega$), which is probed in scattering experiments---the most widely used method of diagnostics at these extreme conditions. In addition to its importance for the study of warm dense matter, the modelling of such dynamic properties of correlated quantum many-body systems constitutes an important theoretical challenge. Here, we report a roton feature in the dynamic structure factor S(q, $\omega$) of the warm dense electron gas, and introduce a microscopic explanation in terms of an electronic pair alignment model. Our results will have direct impact on the interpretation of scattering experiments and may provide insights into the dynamics of a number of correlated quantum many-body systems such as ultracold helium, dipolar supersolids, and bilayer heterostructures.},

abstract = {The “sign problem” (SP) is a fundamental limitation to simulations of strongly correlated matter. It is often argued that the SP is not intrinsic to the physics of particular Hamiltonians because its behavior can be influenced by the choice of algorithm. By contrast, we show that the SP in determinant quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) is quantitatively linked to quantum critical behavior. We demonstrate this through simulations of several models with critical properties that are relatively well understood. We propose a reinterpretation of the low average sign for the Hubbard model on the square lattice away from half filling in terms of the onset of pseudogap behavior and exotic superconductivity. Our study charts a path for exploiting the average sign in QMC simulations to understand quantum critical behavior. Solving challenging problems in quantum many-body physics often involves using numerical Monte Carlo methods. However, in the most interesting regime of strong interactions and low temperatures, the so-called sign problem can make calculations intractable. Mondaini et al. studied the severity of the sign problem quantitatively in several representative models. The researchers found that quantum critical behavior in these models correlated with the regions in the phase diagram where the sign problem was most pronounced. Viewed as a diagnostic for quantum criticality, the sign problem then becomes a tool (in addition to being a nuisance). —JS The severity of the sign problem correlates with quantum criticality in several representative quantum many-body models.}}

We supply the details that are lacking in the seminal literature but are important for the motivated reader to understand the assumptions and approximations embodied in these methods. First, we summarize the general relations between quantum correlation functions and spectral densities. We then review the basic principles, formalism, and philosophy of Bayesian inference and discuss the application of this approach in the context of the analytic continuation problem. Next, we present a detailed case study for the symmetric, infinite-dimension Anderson Hamiltonian. We chose this Hamiltonian because the qualitative features of its spectral density are well established and because a particularly convenient algorithm exists to produce the imaginary-time Green's function data. Shown are all the intermediate steps of data and solution qualification. The importance of careful data preparation and error propagation in the analytic continuation is discussed in the context of this example. Then, we review the different physical systems and physical quantities to which these, or related, procedures have been applied. Finally, we describe other features concerning the application of our methods, their possible improvement, and areas for additional study.}

In addition to the previously investigated nonlinear effects at the original wave number (Dornheim et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 2020, 125, 085001) and the excitation of higher harmonics (Dornheim et al., Phys. Rev. Res., 2021, 3, 033231), the presence of multiple external potentials leads to mode-coupling effects, which constitute the dominant nonlinear effect and lead to a substantially more complicated density response compared to linear response theory. One possibility to estimate mode-coupling effects from a PIMC simulation of the unperturbed system is given in terms of generalized imaginary-time correlation functions that have been recently introduced by Dornheim et al. (J. Chem. Phys., 2021, 155, 054110). In addition, we extend our previous analytical theory of the nonlinear density response of the electron gas in terms of the static local field correction (Dornheim et al., 2020, Phys. Rev. Lett., 125, 235001), which allows for a highly accurate description of the PIMC results with negligible computational cost.}

abstract = {Abstract Warm dense matter (WDM) is an exotic state on the border between condensed matter and dense plasmas. Important occurrences of WDM include dense astrophysical objects, matter in the core of our Earth, and matter produced in strong compression experiments. As of late, x-ray Thomson scattering has become an advanced tool to diagnose WDM. The interpretation of the data requires model input for the dynamic structure factor S(q, ω) and the plasmon dispersion ω(q). Recently, the first ab initio results for S(q, ω) of the homogeneous warm dense electron gas were obtained from path integral Monte Carlo simulations (Dornheim et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 121, 255001, 2018). Here, we analyse the effects of correlations and finite temperature on the dynamic dielectric function and the plasmon dispersion. Our results for the plasmon dispersion and damping differ significantly from the random-phase approximation and from earlier models of the correlated electron gas. Moreover, we show when commonly used weak damping approximations break down and how the method of complex zeroes of the dielectric function can solve this problem for WDM conditions.},

title = {Ultrafast dynamics of strongly correlated fermions—nonequilibrium Green functions and selfenergy approximations},
journal = {Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter},
abstract = {This article presents an overview on recent progress in the theory of nonequilibrium Green functions (NEGF). We discuss applications of NEGF simulations to describe the femtosecond dynamics of various finite fermionic systems following an excitation out of equilibrium. This includes the expansion dynamics of ultracold atoms in optical lattices following a confinement quench and the excitation of strongly correlated electrons in a solid by the impact of a charged particle. NEGF, presently, are the only ab initio quantum approach that is able to study the dynamics of correlations for long times in two and three dimensions. However, until recently, NEGF simulations have mostly been performed with rather simple selfenergy approximations such as the second-order Born approximation (SOA). While they correctly capture the qualitative trends of the relaxation towards equilibrium, the reliability and accuracy of these NEGF simulations has remained open, for a long time.

Here we report on recent tests of NEGF simulations for finite lattice systems against exact-diagonalization and density-matrix-renormalization-group benchmark data. The results confirm the high accuracy and predictive capability of NEGF simulations—provided selfenergies are used that go beyond the SOA and adequately include strong correlation and dynamical-screening effects. With an extended arsenal of selfenergies that can be used effectively, the NEGF approach has the potential of becoming a powerful simulation tool with broad areas of new applications including strongly correlated solids and ultracold atoms. The present review aims at making such applications possible. To this end we present a selfcontained introduction to the theory of NEGF and give an overview on recent numerical applications to compute the ultrafast relaxation dynamics of correlated fermions. In the second part we give a detailed introduction to selfenergies beyond the SOA. Important examples are the third-order approximation, the  approximation, the T-matrix approximation and the fluctuating-exchange approximation. We give a comprehensive summary of the explicit selfenergy expressions for a variety of systems of practical relevance, starting from the most general expressions (general basis) and the Feynman diagrams, and including also the important cases of diagonal basis sets, the Hubbard model and the differences occuring for bosons and fermions. With these details, and information on the computational effort and scaling with the basis size and propagation duration, readers will be able to choose the proper basis set and straightforwardly implement and apply advanced selfenergy approximations to a broad class of systems.}

abstract={The experimental investigation of matter under extreme densities and temperatures, as in astrophysical objects and nuclear fusion applications, constitutes one of the most active frontiers at the interface of material science, plasma physics, and engineering. The central obstacle is given by the rigorous interpretation of the experimental results, as even the diagnosis of basic parameters like the temperature T is rendered difficult at these extreme conditions. Here, we present a simple, approximation-free method to extract the temperature of arbitrarily complex materials in thermal equilibrium from X-ray Thomson scattering experiments, without the need for any simulations or an explicit deconvolution. Our paradigm can be readily implemented at modern facilities and corresponding experiments will have a profound impact on our understanding of warm dense matter and beyond, and open up a variety of appealing possibilities in the context of thermonuclear fusion, laboratory astrophysics, and related disciplines.},

In the present work, we extend these efforts by carrying out extensive new path integral Monte Carlo simulations of a ferromagnetic electron gas that is subject to an external harmonic perturbation. This allows us to unambiguously quantify the impact of spin-effects on the nonlinear density response of the warm dense electron gas. In addition to their utility for the description of WDM in an external magnetic field, our results further advance our current understanding of the uniform electron gas as a fundamental model system, which is important in its own right.}

ABSTRACT = {Finite-temperature density functional theory (DFT) has become of topical interest, partly due to the increasing ability to create novel states of warm-correlated matter (WCM).Warm-dense matter (WDM), ultra-fast matter (UFM), and high-energy density matter (HEDM) may all be regarded as subclasses of WCM. Strong electron-electron, ion-ion and electron-ion correlation effects and partial degeneracies are found in these systems where the electron temperature Te is comparable to the electron Fermi energy EF. Thus, many electrons are in continuum states which are partially occupied. The ion subsystem may be solid, liquid or plasma, with many states of ionization with ionic charge Zj. Quasi-equilibria with the ion temperature Ti ≠ Te are common. The ion subsystem in WCM can no longer be treated as a passive “external potential”, as is customary in T = 0 DFT dominated by solid-state theory or quantum chemistry. Many basic questions arise in trying to implement DFT for WCM. Hohenberg-Kohn-Mermin theory can be adapted for treating these systems if suitable finite-T exchange-correlation (XC) functionals can be constructed. They are functionals of both the one-body electron density ne and the one-body ion densities ρj. Here, j counts many species of nuclei or charge states. A method of approximately but accurately mapping the quantum electrons to a classical Coulomb gas enables one to treat electron-ion systems entirely classically at any temperature and arbitrary spin polarization, using exchange-correlation effects calculated in situ, directly from the pair-distribution functions. This eliminates the need for any XC-functionals. This classical map has been used to calculate the equation of state of WDM systems, and construct a finite-T XC functional that is found to be in close agreement with recent quantum path-integral simulation data. In this review, current developments and concerns in finite-T DFT, especially in the context of non-relativistic warm-dense matter and ultra-fast matter will be presented.},

abstract = {Abstract Warm dense matter (WDM), an exotic, highly compressed state of matter between solid and plasma phases, is of high current interest, in particular for astrophysics and inertial confinement fusion. For the latter, in particular the propagation of compression shocks is crucial. The main unknown in the shock propagation in WDM is the behaviour of the electrons since they are governed by correlations, quantum and spin effects that need to be accounted for simultaneously. Here we describe the shock dynamics of the warm dense electron gas using a quantum hydrodynamic model. From the numerical hydrodynamic simulations, we observe that the quantum Bohm pressure induces shear force that weakens the formation and strength of the shock. In addition, the Bohm pressure induces an electron density response that takes the form of oscillations. This is confirmed by the theoretical analysis of the early stage of the shock formation. Our theoretical and numerical analyses allow us to identify characteristic dimensionless shock propagation parameters at which the effect of the Bohm force is important.},

Here, we give general background on Coulomb coupling and computational expense, review where some transport coefficients appear in hydrodynamic equations, and present the submitted data. Large variations are found when either the relevant Coulomb coupling parameter is large or computational expense causes difficulties. Understanding the general accuracy and uncertainty associated with such transport coefficients is important for quantifying errors in hydrodynamic simulations of inertial confinement fusion and high-energy density experiments.}

abstract = {The conditions in which hydrogen disassociates and becomes an atomic metal occur in high-energy-density environments, such as the interiors of giant planets and nuclear explosions. Celliers et al. trained 168 lasers on deuterium samples at the National Ignition Facility to measure the pressure and temperature conditions of the hydrogen transition. Careful optical measurements led to the addition of four new points on the phase diagram, consistent with static estimates and theoretical calculations. Science, this issue p. 677 Optical measurements of laser-shocked deuterium pinpoint the molecular-atom and insulator-metal transitions. Dense fluid metallic hydrogen occupies the interiors of Jupiter, Saturn, and many extrasolar planets, where pressures reach millions of atmospheres. Planetary structure models must describe accurately the transition from the outer molecular envelopes to the interior metallic regions. We report optical measurements of dynamically compressed fluid deuterium to 600 gigapascals (GPa) that reveal an increasing refractive index, the onset of absorption of visible light near 150 GPa, and a transition to metal-like reflectivity (exceeding 30\%) near 200 GPa, all at temperatures below 2000 kelvin. Our measurements and analysis address existing discrepancies between static and dynamic experiments for the insulator-metal transition in dense fluid hydrogen isotopes. They also provide new benchmarks for the theoretical calculations used to construct planetary models.}}

Knudson et al. compressed liquid deuterium to extreme temperatures and pressures using high-energy magnetic pulses at the Sandia Z-machine (see the Perspective by Ackland). Deuterium began to reflect like a mirror during compression, as the electrical conductivity sharply increased. The observed conditions for metallization of deuterium and hydrogen help us to build theoretical models for the universe's most abundant element. This a our understanding of the internal layering of gas giant planets such as Jupiter and Saturn. Science, this issue p. 1455; see also p. 1429 Magnetic compression drives an insulator-to-metal transition in dense liquid deuterium. [Also see Perspective by Ackland] Eighty years ago, it was proposed that solid hydrogen would become metallic at sufficiently high density. Despite numerous investigations, this transition has not yet been experimentally observed. More recently, there has been much interest in the analog of this predicted metallic transition in the dense liquid, due to its relevance to planetary science. Here, we show direct observation of an abrupt insulator-to-metal transition in dense liquid deuterium. Experimental determination of the location of this transition provides a much-needed benchmark for theory and may constrain the region of hydrogen-helium immiscibility and the boundary-layer pressure in standard models of the internal structure of gas-giant planets.}}

abstract = {We present an overview of the magneto-inertial fusion (MIF) concept Magnetized Liner Inertial Fusion (MagLIF) pursued at Sandia National Laboratories and review some of the most prominent results since the initial experiments in 2013. In MagLIF, a centimeter-scale beryllium tube or ‘liner’ is filled with a fusion fuel, axially pre-magnetized, laser pre-heated, and finally imploded using up to 20 MA from the Z machine. All of these elements are necessary to generate a thermonuclear plasma: laser preheating raises the initial temperature of the fuel, the electrical current implodes the liner and quasi-adiabatically compresses the fuel via the Lorentz force, and the axial magnetic field limits thermal conduction from the hot plasma to the cold liner walls during the implosion. MagLIF is the first MIF concept to demonstrate fusion relevant temperatures, significant fusion production (&gt;1013 primary DD neutron yield), and magnetic trapping of charged fusion particles. On a 60 MA next-generation pulsed-power machine, two-dimensional simulations suggest that MagLIF has the potential to generate multi-MJ yields with significant self-heating, a long-term goal of the US Stockpile Stewardship Program. At currents exceeding 65 MA, the high gains required for fusion energy could be achievable.}

abstract={Obtaining a burning plasma is a critical step towards self-sustaining fusion energy1. A burning plasma is one in which the fusion reactions themselves are the primary source of heating in the plasma, which is necessary to sustain and propagate the burn, enabling high energy gain. After decades of fusion research, here we achieve a burning-plasma state in the laboratory. These experiments were conducted at the US National Ignition Facility, a laser facility delivering up to 1.9{\thinspace}megajoules of energy in pulses with peak powers up to 500{\thinspace}terawatts. We use the lasers to generate X-rays in a radiation cavity to indirectly drive a fuel-containing capsule via the X-ray ablation pressure, which results in the implosion process compressing and heating the fuel via mechanical work. The burning-plasma state was created using a strategy to increase the spatial scale of the capsule2,3 through two different implosion concepts4--7. These experiments show fusion self-heating in excess of the mechanical work injected into the implosions, satisfying several burning-plasma metrics3,8. Additionally, we describe a subset of experiments that appear to have crossed the static self-heating boundary, where fusion heating surpasses the energy losses from radiation and conduction. These results provide an opportunity to study $\alpha$-particle-dominated plasmas and burning-plasma physics in the laboratory.},

journal = {New Journal of Physics},
abstract = {This paper reviews the treatment of high-frequency Thomson scattering in the non-relativistic and near-relativistic regimes with the primary purpose of understanding the nature of the frequency redistribution correction to the differential cross-section. This correction is generally represented by a factor involving the ratio ω α /ω β of the scattered (α) to primary (β) frequencies of the radiation. In some formulae given in the literature, the ratio appears squared, in others it does not. In Compton scattering, the frequency change is generally understood to be due to the recoil of the particle as a result of energy and momentum conservation in the photon–electron system. In this case, the Klein–Nishina formula gives the redistribution factor as . In the case of scattering by a many-particle system, however, the frequency and momentum changes are no longer directly interdependent but depend also upon the properties of the medium, which are encoded in the dynamic structure factor. We show that the redistribution factor explicit in the quantum cross-section (that seen by a photon) is ω α /ω β, which is not squared. Formulae for the many-body cross-section given in the literature, in which the factor is squared, can often be attributed to a different (classical) definition of the cross-section, though not all authors are explicit about which definition they are using. What is shown not to be true is that the structure factor simply gives the ratio of the many-electron to one-electron differential cross-sections, as is sometimes supposed. Mixing up the cross-section definitions can lead to errors when describing x-ray scattering. We illustrate the nature of the discrepancy by deriving the energy-integrated angular distributions, with first-order relativistic corrections, for classical and quantum scattering measurements, as well as the radiative opacity for photon diffusion in a Thomson-scattering medium, which is generally considered to be governed by quantum processes.}

abstract={Carbon is the fourth-most prevalent element in the Universe and essential for all known life. In the elemental form it is found in multiple allotropes, including graphite, diamond and fullerenes, and it has long been predicted that even more structures can exist at pressures greater than those at Earth's core1--3. Several phases have been predicted to exist in the multi-terapascal regime, which is important for accurate modelling of the interiors of carbon-rich exoplanets4,5. By compressing solid carbon to 2 terapascals (20 million atmospheres; more than five times the pressure at Earth's core) using ramp-shaped laser pulses and simultaneously measuring nanosecond-duration time-resolved X-ray diffraction, we found that solid carbon retains the diamond structure far beyond its regime of predicted stability. The results confirm predictions that the strength of the tetrahedral molecular orbital bonds in diamond persists under enormous pressure, resulting in large energy barriers that hinder conversion to more-stable high-pressure allotropes1,2, just as graphite formation from metastable diamond is kinetically hindered at atmospheric pressure. This work nearly doubles the highest pressure at which X-ray diffraction has been recorded on any material.},

abstract={The effects of hydrocarbon reactions and diamond precipitation on the internal structure and evolution of icy giant planets such as Neptune and Uranus have been discussed for more than three decades1. Inside these celestial bodies, simple hydrocarbons such as methane, which are highly abundant in the atmospheres2, are believed to undergo structural transitions3,4that release hydrogen from deeper layers and may lead to compact stratified cores5--7. Indeed, from the surface towards the core, the isentropes of Uranus and Neptune intersect a temperature--pressure regime in which methane first transforms into a mixture of hydrocarbon polymers8, whereas, in deeper layers, a phase separation into diamond and hydrogen may be possible. Here we show experimental evidence for this phase separation process obtained by in situ X-ray diffraction from polystyrene (C8H8)nsamples dynamically compressed to conditions around 150?GPa and 5,000?K; these conditions resemble the environment around 10,000?km below the surfaces of Neptune and Uranus9. Our findings demonstrate the necessity of high pressures for initiating carbon--hydrogen separation3and imply that diamond precipitation may require pressures about ten times as high as previously indicated by static compression experiments4,8,10. Our results will inform mass--radius relationships of carbon-bearing exoplanets11, provide constraints for their internal layer structure and improve evolutionary models of Uranus and Neptune, in which carbon--hydrogen separation could influence the convective heat transport7.},

abstract={The shock-induced transition from graphite to diamond has been of great scientific and technological interest since the discovery of microscopic diamonds in remnants of explosively driven graphite. Furthermore, shock synthesis of diamond and lonsdaleite, a speculative hexagonal carbon polymorph with unique hardness, is expected to happen during violent meteor impacts. Here, we show unprecedented in situ X-ray diffraction measurements of diamond formation on nanosecond timescales by shock compression of pyrolytic as well as polycrystalline graphite to pressures from 19{\thinspace}GPa up to 228{\thinspace}GPa. While we observe the transition to diamond starting at 50{\thinspace}GPa for both pyrolytic and polycrystalline graphite, we also record the direct formation of lonsdaleite above 170{\thinspace}GPa for pyrolytic samples only. Our experiment provides new insights into the processes of the shock-induced transition from graphite to diamond and uniquely resolves the dynamics that explain the main natural occurrence of the lonsdaleite crystal structure being close to meteor impact sites.},

abstract={The quest for controlled fusion energy has been ongoing for over a half century. The demonstration of ignition and energy gain from thermonuclear fuels in the laboratory has been a major goal of fusion research for decades. Thermonuclear ignition is widely considered a milestone in the development of fusion energy, as well as a major scientific achievement with important applications in national security and basic sciences. The US is arguably the world leader in the inertial confinement approach to fusion and has invested in large facilities to pursue it, with the objective of establishing the science related to the safety and reliability of the stockpile of nuclear weapons. Although significant progress has been made in recent years, major challenges still remain in the quest for thermonuclear ignition via laser fusion. Here, we review the current state of the art in inertial confinement fusion research and describe the underlying physical principles.},

abstract = {The uniform electron gas (UEG) is one of the key models for the understanding of warm dense matter—an exotic, highly compressed state of matter between solid and plasma phases. The difficulty in modelling the UEG arises from the need to simultaneously account for Coulomb correlations, quantum effects, and exchange effects, as well as finite temperature. The most accurate results so far were obtained from quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations with a variety of representations. However, QMC for electrons is hampered by the fermion sign problem. Here, we present results from a novel fermionic propagator path integral Monte Carlo in the restricted grand canonical ensemble. The ab initio simulation results for the spin-resolved pair distribution functions and static structure factor are reported for two isotherms (T in the units of the Fermi temperature). Furthermore, we combine the results from the linear response theory in the Singwi-Tosi-Land-Sjölander scheme with the QMC data to remove finite-size errors in the interaction energy. We present a new corrected parametrization for the interaction energy and the exchange–correlation free energy in the thermodynamic limit, and benchmark our results against the restricted path integral Monte Carlo by Brown et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 146405 (2013)] and configuration path integral Monte Carlo/permutation-blocking path integral Monte Carlo by Dornheim et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 117, 115701 (2016)].},

    abstract = "{Time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) is a quantum mechanical framework which describes the dynamics of interacting electronic many-body systems formally exactly and in a computationally efficient manner. This book presents the concepts of TDDFT at the graduate level. An overview is given of the current state of the art of the field, with many applications in physics, (bio)chemistry, and materials science. The book begins with a self-contained review of ground-state density-functional theory, followed by four main parts. The first part presents the formal framework of TDDFT, beginning with the basic existence theorems of Runge, Gross, and van Leeuwen. The time-dependent Kohn-Sham scheme and the properties of the time-dependent exchange-correlation potential are then discussed in detail. The second part deals with the TDDFT formulation of linear-response theory, which can be used to calculate electronic excitation energies in principle exactly using the Casida equation. An overview is given of the performance of TDDFT for atomic and molecular excitation energies, with many examples. Special attention is paid to challenging cases such as double or charge-transfer excitations. The third part of the book focuses on further developments, including time-dependent current-density-functional theory, the optimized effective potential, and the connection to many-body theory. This part also deals with excitations in extended systems, such as plasmons and excitons. Several special TDDFT topics are discussed in part four: van der Waals interactions, nanoscale transport, strong-field phenomena, and coupled electron-nuclear motion and molecular dynamics. Additional resources are provided in several appendices.}",

abstract={The scattering of photons in plasmas is an important diagnostic tool. Especially, the region of warm dense matter can be probed by X-ray Thomson scattering. The scattering cross-section is related to the dynamic structure factor {\$}S(k,{\backslash}omega){\$}. We improve the standard treatment of the scattering on free electrons within the random phase approximation (RPA) by including collisions. The dielectric function is calculated in the Born-Mermin approximation. The inclusion of collisions modifies the dynamic structure factor significantly in the warm dense matter regime. We conclude that a theoretical description beyond the RPA is needed to derive reliable results for plasma parameters from X-ray Thomson scattering experiments.},

abstract = {The extended first-principles molecular dynamics (Extended FPMD) model introduced by Zhang et al. [2], based on an analytical single plane wave description of electronic orbitals for high energy electrons, has been implemented within the ab initio DFT software package Abinit and is now available. This model allows quantum simulations to be done smoothly on the full range of temperatures from cold condensed matter to hot dense plasmas passing through the warm dense matter regime which was currently not possible within the same ab initio model due to numerical limitations. In addition to presenting a brief theoretical background of the Zhang et al. method, we propose some improvements to the model. We then present the details of the implementation, and finally offer an application to the aluminum simulations for multiple densities, from room temperature to hot (thousands of eVs) temperature ranges, with a resulting Hugoniot equation of state that we compare with other methods.}

abstract = {The role of computer graphics in different aspects of simulating matter on the atomic scale is discussed. The computer graphics is useful in specifying and examining chemical structures, since it is nowadays possible to study––with density functional theory––complex systems containing up to a few hundreds in-equivalent atoms. Furthermore, computer graphics is also an indispensable tool in analysing computed data and facilitates interpretation of results. In this context XCrySDen (http://www.xcrysden.org/) is presented, a crystalline- and molecular-structure visualisation program, which aims at display of isosurfaces and contours, which can be superimposed on crystalline structures and interactively rotated and manipulated. Another aspect of computer utilisation in simulations that takes advantage of the computer’s graphics capabilities, is that it provides intuitive graphical user interfaces for the simulation setup. It is demonstrated how such interfaces are easily built using the developed GUIB software (http://www-k3.ijs.si/kokalj/guib/).}

The computed momentum distribution shows significant deviations from behavior of free fermions when strong correlations are present but agrees with predictions from variational methods.}

abstract={We review recent progress in theory and simulation of strongly correlated classical plasmas, in general, and dusty plasmas, in particular. Using the one-component plasma (OCP) as a model, the structural properties of extended and finite correlated systems are analyzed and criteria for disordering transitions are introduced. These are based on the pair and three-particle distribution functions and the associated reduced entropies and heat capacities. These quantities are computed from the particle positions alone and are, thus, directly accessible in experiments. Further, these quantities are applied to confined systems where disordering proceeds via a sequence of phase transitions which have to be clearly distinguished. In the second part of this review, the transport properties of strongly correlated plasmas in equilibrium are considered, particularly under the influence of an external magnetic field. Examples given are for the diffusion, heat conduction and viscosity. Here, the influence on both fundamental transport coefficients and on particle-resolved dynamical effects is considered. Finally, we give a brief discussion of spin and quantum effects and how they influence the structural and dynamical properties of correlated systems.},

abstract = {To aid in the physical interpretation of planetary radii constrained through observations of transiting planets, or eventually direct detections, we compute model radii of pure hydrogen-helium, water, rock, and iron planets, along with various mixtures. Masses ranging from 0.01 Earth masses to 10 Jupiter masses at orbital distances of 0.02-10 AU are considered. For hydrogen-helium rich planets, our models are the first to couple planetary evolution to stellar irradiation over a wide range of orbital separations (0.02-10 AU) through a nongray radiative-convective equilibrium atmosphere model. Stellar irradiation retards the contraction of giant planets, but its effect is not a simple function of the irradiation level: a planet at 1 AU contracts as slowly as a planet at 0.1 AU. We confirm the assertion of Guillot that very old giant planets under modest stellar irradiation (like that received by Jupiter and Saturn) develop isothermal atmospheric radiative zones once the planet's intrinsic flux drops to a small fraction of the incident flux. For hydrogen-helium planets, we consider cores up to 90% of the total planet mass, comparable to those of Uranus and Neptune. If "hot Neptunes" have maintained their original masses and are not remnants of more massive planets, radii of ~0.30-0.45 RJ are expected. Water planets are ~40%-50% larger than rocky planets, independent of mass. Finally, we provide tables of planetary radii at various ages and compositions, and for ice-rock-iron planets we fit our results to analytic functions, which will allow for quick composition estimates, given masses and radii, or mass estimates, given only planetary radii. These results will assist in the interpretation of observations for both the current transiting planet surveys as well as upcoming space missions, including COROT and Kepler.}

As a representative model system, we consider electrons in a 2D harmonic trap. We find that the sign problem in the GCE is even more severe than in the canonical ensemble at the same conditions, which, in general, makes the latter the preferred option. Despite these difficulties, we show that fermionic PIMC simulations in the GCE are still feasible in many cases, which potentially gives access to important quantities like the compressibility or the Matsubara Greens function. This has important implications for contemporary fields of research such as warm dense matter, ultracold atoms, and electrons in quantum dots.}

    abstract = { The two isotopes of helium offer unique opportunities to test fundamental theories of quantum fluids. In liquid 4He, a Bose liquid, the elementary excitations have been studied extensively over the last two decades by neutron inelastic scattering. Similar studies of liquid 3He, the Fermi liquid counterpart of liquid 4He, have become possible only recently. From the results obtained so far for normal liquid 3He, the existence of zero sound as a well defined density excitation at finite wavevectors (q « qF) and finite temperatures (T = TF) has been verified and the spin fluctuation spectrum has been measured. By comparing the neutron scattering results for the density fluctuation spectrum with R. P. A. calculations with generalized polarization potentials, important information has been obtained about the effective spin-symmetric interaction between 3He atoms. The spin fluctuation spectrum is in agreement with the paramagnon model if a value close to unity is assumed for the contact dimensionless paramagnon parameter I. This implies that the nuclear spin system in normal liquid 3He is close to ferromagnetic. }

These ejecta clouds are released into either vacuum or various types of catcher systems, and are monitored with high-speed recordings (frame rates up to 10 MHz). Molecular dynamics simulations are used to give insights to the rate of diamond preservation throughout the free expansion and catcher impact process, highlighting the challenges of diamond retrieval. Raman spectroscopy data show graphitic signatures on a catcher plate confirming that the shock-compressed polystyrene is transformed. First electron microscopy analyses of solid catcher plates yield an outstanding number of different spherical-like objects in the size range between ten(s) up to hundreds of nanometres, which are one type of two potential diamond candidates identified. The origin of some objects can unambiguously be assigned, while the history of others remains speculative.}

abstract = {We present the theory necessary for analysing Thomson scattering data from plasmas in states far from equilibrium. As an example, we compare with experimental data obtained during the interaction of cryogenic hydrogen with the intense VUV radiation of the FLASH free electron laser at DESY in Hamburg. The component due to inelastic scattering from free electrons is treated within a generalised quantum statistical approach which accounts for the nonequilibrium states produced by the strong pump of the FEL radiation. The elastic scattering component is determined by the structure factor of the ions for the initial conditions of a cold, atomic fluid as the ions do not rearrange during the interaction time. Monte Carlo simulations show that this treatment results in a very small elastic scattering feature. Integrating the full nonequilibrium spectrum over time yields excellent agreement with the measured data. Moreover, this treatment gives quantitatively different plasma conditions as may be inferred using an equilibrium analysis.}

abstract = {The matter in extreme conditions end station at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) is a new tool enabling accurate pump–probe measurements for studying the physical properties of matter in the high-energy density (HED) physics regime. This instrument combines the world’s brightest x-ray source, the LCLS x-ray beam, with high-power lasers consisting of two nanosecond Nd:glass laser beams and one short-pulse Ti:sapphire laser. These lasers produce short-lived states of matter with high pressures, high temperatures or high densities with properties that are important for applications in nuclear fusion research, laboratory astrophysics and the development of intense radiation sources. In the first experiments, we have performed highly accurate x-ray diffraction and x-ray Thomson scattering measurements on shock-compressed matter resolving the transition from compressed solid matter to a co-existence regime and into the warm dense matter state. These complex charged-particle systems are dominated by strong correlations and quantum effects. They exist in planetary interiors and laboratory experiments, e.g., during high-power laser interactions with solids or the compression phase of inertial confinement fusion implosions. Applying record peak brightness x-rays resolves the ionic interactions at atomic (Ångstrom) scale lengths and measure the static structure factor, which is a key quantity for determining equation of state data and important transport coefficients. Simultaneously, spectrally resolved measurements of plasmon features provide dynamic structure factor information that yield temperature and density with unprecedented precision at micron-scale resolution in dynamic compression experiments. These studies have demonstrated our ability to measure fundamental thermodynamic properties that determine the state of matter in the HED physics regime.}

journal = {Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter},
abstract = {Warm dense matter (WDM) describes an intermediate phase, between condensed matter and classical plasmas, found in natural and man-made systems. In a laboratory setting, WDM is often created dynamically. It is typically laser or pulse-power generated and can be difficult to characterize experimentally. Measuring the energy loss of high energy ions, caused by a WDM target, is both a promising diagnostic and of fundamental importance to inertial confinement fusion research. However, electron coupling, degeneracy, and quantum effects limit the accuracy of easily calculable kinetic models for stopping power, while high temperatures make the traditional tools of condensed matter, e.g. time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT), often intractable. We have developed a mixed stochastic-deterministic approach to TD-DFT which provides more efficient computation while maintaining the required precision for model discrimination. Recently, this approach showed significant improvement compared to models when compared to experimental energy loss measurements in WDM carbon. Here, we describe this approach and demonstrate its application to warm dense carbon stopping across a range of projectile velocities. We compare direct stopping-power calculation to approaches based on combining homogeneous electron gas response with bound electrons, with parameters extracted from our TD-DFT calculations.}

The field is so huge that no attempt to be comprehensive is made. We focus on the underlying exact theory, the origin of approximations, and the tension between empirical and nonempirical approaches. Many ideas are illustrated on the exchange energy and hole. Features unique to this article include how approximations can be systematically derived in a nonempirical fashion and a survey of warm dense matter. }

abstract={Two of the most influential ideas developed by Richard Feynman are the Feynman diagram technique and his variational approach. Here we show that combining both, and introducing a diagrammatic quantum Monte Carlo method, results in a powerful and accurate solver to the generic solid state problem, in which a macroscopic number of electrons interact by the long range Coulomb repulsion. We apply it to the quintessential problem of solid state, the uniform electron gas, which is at the heart of the density functional theory success in describing real materials, yet it has not been adequately solved for over 90 years. Our method allows us to calculate numerically exact momentum and frequency resolved spin and charge response functions. This method can be applied to a number of moderately interacting electron systems, including models of realistic metallic and semiconducting solids.},

abstract = {Abstract A novel path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) approach for correlated many-particle systems with arbitrary pair interaction in continuous space at low temperatures is presented. It is based on a representation of the N -particle density operator in a basis of (anti-)symmetrized N -particle states (configurations of occupation numbers). The path integral is transformed into a sum over trajectories with the same topology and, finally, the limit of M → ∞, where M is the number of high-temperature factors, is analytically performed. This yields exact expressions for the thermodynamic quantities and allows to perform efficient simulations for fermions at low temperature and weak to moderate coupling. Our method is expected to be applicable to dense quantum plasmas in the regime of strong degeneracy where conventional PIMC fails due to the fermion sign problem (© 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co.

abstract = {We develop a new approach to modeling many-body systems based on Bohm’s interpretation of quantum mechanics. Modeling many-body quantum systems with strong interactions is one of the core challenges of modern physics. A range of methods has been developed to approach this task, each with its own idiosyncrasies, approximations, and realm of applicability. However, there remain many problems that are intractable for existing methods. In particular, many approaches face a huge computational barrier when modeling large numbers of coupled electrons and ions at finite temperature. Here, we address this shortfall with a new approach to modeling many-body quantum systems. On the basis of the Bohmian trajectory formalism, our new method treats the full particle dynamics with a considerable increase in computational speed. As a result, we are able to perform large-scale simulations of coupled electron-ion systems without using the adiabatic Born-Oppenheimer approximation.}}

abstract={Last year, at least 30,000 scientific papers used the Kohn--Sham scheme of density functional theory to solve electronic structure problems in a wide variety of scientific fields. Machine learning holds the promise of learning the energy functional via examples, bypassing the need to solve the Kohn--Sham equations. This should yield substantial savings in computer time, allowing larger systems and/or longer time-scales to be tackled, but attempts to machine-learn this functional have been limited by the need to find its derivative. The present work overcomes this difficulty by directly learning the density-potential and energy-density maps for test systems and various molecules. We perform the first molecular dynamics simulation with a machine-learned density functional on malonaldehyde and are able to capture the intramolecular proton transfer process. Learning density models now allows the construction of accurate density functionals for realistic molecular systems.},

Trained on energies and forces obtained from electronic-structure calculations, they inherit their predictive accuracy, and extend greatly the length and time scales that are accessible to explicit atomistic simulations. Inexpensive predictions of the energetics of individual configurations have facilitated greatly the calculation of the thermodynamics of materials, including finite-temperature effects and disorder. More recently, ML models have been closing the gap with first-principles calculations in another area: the prediction of arbitrarily complicated functional properties, from vibrational and optical spectroscopies to electronic excitations. The implementation of integrated ML models that combine energetic and functional predictions with statistical and dynamical sampling of atomic-scale properties is bringing the promise of predictive, uncompromising simulations of existing and novel materials closer to its full realization.},

abstract = {Abstract Recently a number of theoretical studies of the uniform electron gas (UEG) at finite temperature have appeared that are of relevance for dense plasmas, warm dense matter and laser excited solids and thermodynamic density functional theory simulations. In particular, restricted path integral Monte Carlo (RPIMC) results became available which, however, due to the Fermion sign problem, are confined to moderate quantum degeneracy, i.e. low to moderate densities. We have recently developed an alternative approach–configuration PIMC [T. Schoof et al., Contrib. Plasma Phys. 51, 687 (2011)] that allows one to study the so far not accessible high degeneracy regime. Here we present the first step towards UEG simulations using CPIMC by studying implementation and performance of the method for the model case of N = 4 particles. We also provide benchmark data for the total energy. (© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim)},

However, TDDFT calculations are free from fitting parameters and assumptions about the model form of the dielectric function.

Here we discuss recent implementations around this approach, in particular in the context of complex, extended systems. Results include an analysis of the computational cost associated with numerical propagation and when using absorbing boundary conditions. We extensively explore the shortcomings for describing electron--electron scattering in real time and compare to many-body perturbation theory. Modern improvements of the description of exchange and correlation are reviewed. In this work, we specifically focus on the Qb@ll code, which we have mainly used for these types of simulations over the last years, and we conclude by pointing to further progress needed going forward.},

Conditions addressed are those of interest for recent studies of warm dense matter: solid densities and temperatures from zero to plasma states. An effective pair potential and coupling constant are introduced, incorporating the ideal gas, low density, and weak-coupling quantum limits. The resulting parameter-free, analytic model is illustrated by the calculation of the pair correlation function via strong-coupling classical liquid state theory. The results compare favorably with the first finite-temperature restricted path integral Monte Carlo simulations reported recently.}

In addition to the derivation for the paramagnetic state, that for the ferromagnetic state is carried out afresh in which a correction in the strong Coulomb coupling regime is incorporated into the construction of the analytic expression as a function of the coupling constant and Fermi degeneracy. The fitting formula for fxc is then extended over any degree of spin polarization with the aid of available interpolation scheme. The proposed equation of state, called the iSTLS formula, shows reasonable agreement with the existing quantum Monte Carlo evaluations at finite temperatures in the paramagnetic state, thus giving a consensus for the thermodynamic functions between many-body theories and computer simulations. On the other hand, the current status for the agreement between various evaluations of fxc is relatively unsatisfactory in the ferromagnetic state, suggesting the necessity for further investigations.},

By studying the two-dimensional bosonic dipole systems paradigm, we find that classical molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations provide a faithful representation of the dispersion relation for a low-temperature quantum system. The MD simulations allow one to examine the effect of coupling strength on the formation of the roton minimum and to demonstrate that it is always generated at a sufficiently high enough coupling. Moreover, the classical images of the roton-roton, roton-maxon, etc. states also appear in the MD simulation spectra as a consequence of the strong coupling.}

	abstract = {Correlated fermions are of high interest in condensed matter (Fermi liquids, Wigner molecules), cold atomic gases and dense plasmas. Here we propose a novel approach to path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations of strongly degenerate non-ideal fermions at finite temperature by combining a fourth-order factorization of the density matrix with antisymmetric propagators, i.e., determinants, between all imaginary time slices. To efficiently run through the modified configuration space, we introduce a modification of the widely used continuous space worm algorithm, which allows for an efficient sampling at arbitrary system parameters. We demonstrate how the application of determinants achieves an effective blocking of permutations with opposite signs, leading to a significant relieve of the fermion sign problem. To benchmark the capability of our method regarding the simulation of degenerate fermions, we consider multiple electrons in a quantum dot and compare our results with other ab initio techniques, where they are available. The present permutation blocking PIMC approach allows us to obtain accurate results even for N = 20 electrons at low temperature and arbitrary coupling, where no other ab initio results have been reported, so far.}

This allows us to study the P-dependence of different observables of the configuration space in the Monte Carlo simulations and of the fermion sign problem.

Finally, we touch upon the uniform electron gas in the warm dense matter regime.},

	abstract = {White dwarfs represent the final state of evolution for most stars1–3. Certain classes of white dwarfs pulsate4,5, leading to observable brightness variations, and analysis of these variations with theoretical stellar models probes their internal structure. Modelling of these pulsating stars provides stringent tests of white dwarf models and a detailed picture of the outcome of the late stages of stellar evolution6. However, the high-energy-density states that exist in white dwarfs are extremely difficult to reach and to measure in the laboratory, so theoretical predictions are largely untested at these conditions. Here we report measurements of the relationship between pressure and density along the principal shock Hugoniot (equations describing the state of the sample material before and after the passage of the shock derived from conservation laws) of hydrocarbon to within five per cent. The observed maximum compressibility is consistent with theoretical models that include detailed electronic structure. This is relevant for the equation of state of matter at pressures ranging from 100 million to 450 million atmospheres, where the understanding of white dwarf physics is sensitive to the equation of state and where models differ considerably. The measurements test these equation-of-state relations that are used in the modelling of white dwarfs and inertial confinement fusion experiments7,8, and we predict an increase in compressibility due to ionization of the inner-core orbitals of carbon. We also find that a detailed treatment of the electronic structure and the electron degeneracy pressure is required to capture the measured shape of the pressure–density evolution for hydrocarbon before peak compression. Our results illuminate the equation of state of the white dwarf envelope (the region surrounding the stellar core that contains partially ionized and partially degenerate non-ideal plasmas), which is a weak link in the constitutive physics informing the structure and evolution of white dwarf stars9.},

This intensity for a metal is shown to differ from the usual scattered intensity from a non-metal in two points: the atomic form factor and the incoherent (Compton) scattering factor. It is shown that the valence electron form factor, which constitutes the atomic form factor in a liquid metal, leads to a determination of the electron-electron and electron-ion structure factors by combining the ionic structure factor. The authors clarify some confusion which appeared in the proposal by Egelstaff et al. (1974) for extracting the electron-electron correlation function in a metal from X-ray and neutron scattering experiments. A procedure to extract the electron-electron and electron-ion structure factors in a liquid metal is proposed on the basis of the formula for the scattered intensity derived.}

The emerging modes are controlled by the imposed perturbation amplitude. They include satellite signals around the standard plasmon feature, transformation of plasmons to optical modes, and double-plasmon modes. These modes exhibit a pronounced dependence on the temperature. This makes them potentially invaluable for the diagnostics of plasma parameters in the warm dense matter regime. We demonstrate that these modes can be probed with present experimental techniques.},

abstract="Density functional theory (DFT) has become the most popular approach to electronic structure across disciplines, especially in material and chemical sciences. In 2016, at least 30,000 papers used DFT to make useful predictions or give insight into an enormous diversity of scientific problems, ranging from battery development to solar cell efficiency and far beyond. The success of this field has been driven by usefully accurate approximations based on known exact conditions and careful testing and validation. In the last decade, applications of DFT in a new area, warm dense matter, have exploded. DFT is revolutionizing simulations of warm dense matter including applications in controlled fusion, planetary interiors, and other areas of high energy density physics. Over the past decade or so, molecular dynamics calculations driven by modern density functional theory have played a crucial role in bringing chemical realism to these applications, often (but not always) in excellent agreement with experiment. This chapter summarizes recent work from our group on density functional theory at nonzero temperatures, which we call thermal DFT. We explain the relevance of this work in the context of warm dense matter, and the importance of quantum chemistry to this regime. We illustrate many basic concepts on a simple model system, the asymmetric Hubbard dimer.",

	abstract = {Electronic structure calculations have become an indispensable tool in many areas of materials science and quantum chemistry. Even though the Kohn–Sham formulation of the density-functional theory (DFT) simplifies the many-body problem significantly, one is still confronted with several numerical challenges. In this article we present the projector augmented-wave (PAW) method as implemented in the GPAW program package (https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/gpaw) using a uniform real-space grid representation of the electronic wavefunctions. Compared to more traditional plane wave or localized basis set approaches, real-space grids offer several advantages, most notably good computational scalability and systematic convergence properties. However, as a unique feature GPAW also facilitates a localized atomic-orbital basis set in addition to the grid. The efficient atomic basis set is complementary to the more accurate grid, and the possibility to seamlessly switch between the two representations provides great flexibility. While DFT allows one to study ground state properties, time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) provides access to the excited states. We have implemented the two common formulations of TDDFT, namely the linear-response and the time propagation schemes. Electron transport calculations under finite-bias conditions can be performed with GPAW using non-equilibrium Green functions and the localized basis set. In addition to the basic features of the real-space PAW method, we also describe the implementation of selected exchange–correlation functionals, parallelization schemes, ΔSCF-method, x-ray absorption spectra, and maximally localized Wannier orbitals.},

In ASE, tasks are fully scripted in Python. The powerful syntax of Python combined with the NumPy array library make it possible to perform very complex simulation tasks. For example, a sequence of calculations may be performed with the use of a simple ‘for-loop’ construction. Calculations of energy, forces, stresses and other quantities are performed through interfaces to many external electronic structure codes or force fields using a uniform interface. On top of this calculator interface, ASE provides modules for performing many standard simulation tasks such as structure optimization, molecular dynamics, handling of constraints and performing nudged elastic band calculations.},

It is proved that fermion nodal regions have a tiling property, there is only one distinct kind of nodal region. All others are related to it by permutational symmetry. For some free particle systems, it is shown that there are only two nodal regions. An explicit form for the nodes of the many-fermion density matrix would enable exact simulations to be carried out at finite temperature. In the high-temperature limit, its nodes are related to Voronoi polyhedra. Twodimensional cross sections of nodes are depicted. General computable families of fermion wave functions and density matrices are discussed.},

This allows us to study the convergence of different properties towards the classical limit. In particular, we investigate the classical relation between the static structure factor S(q) and the static local field correction G(q), which is only fulfilled at low densities. Moreover, we compare our new results for the interaction energy to the parametrization of the UEG by Groth et al. (2017), which interpolates between PIMC results for θ≤8 and the Debye–Hückel limit, and to higher order analytical virial expansions. Finally, we consider the momentum distribution function n(q) and find an interaction-induced increase in the occupation of the zero-momentum state even for θ≳32. All PIMC data are freely available online, and can be used as input for improved parametrizations and as a rigorous benchmark for approximate methods.}

The model is applied to the calculation of ion–ion pair distribution functions gII(r) for tungsten in the warm and hot dense matter regimes. These results are compared to orbital-free molecular dynamics simulations and excellent agreement is found. Calculations of gII(r) with a simple version of the model (which we call the ion-sphere model) are in remarkable agreement with those of the full model. This ion-sphere model provides a simple and efficient method of calculating accurate gII(r) for warm and hot dense matter for many applications involving low- to high-Z elements with a modest investment of effort.}

However, this requires the use of these potentials in a regime where the approximations employed in their derivation begin to break down. This work presents a careful analysis of the methodology and approximations used to derive semi-classical potentials for Coulomb systems. Particular attention is paid to the appearance of many-body effects and the techniques that may be used to model them. Analytical arguments and simple examples indicate that the role of many-body effects cannot be ignored in the warm dense matter regime, and those semi-classical Coulomb potentials that focus on the pair interaction do not adequately treat many-body effects.}

We extend DDFT to quantum systems for application to dense plasmas through a quantum hydrodynamics (QHD) approach. The DDFT-based QHD approach includes correlations in the the equation of state self-consistently, satisfies sum rules and includes irreversibility arising from collisions. While QHD can be used generally to model non-equilibrium, heterogeneous plasmas, we employ the DDFT-QHD framework to generate a model for the electronic dynamic structure factor, which offers an avenue for measuring hydrodynamic properties, such as transport coefficients via x-ray Thomson scattering.},

By accurately recalculating the RPA correlation energy as a function of electron density and spin polarization we demonstrate the inadequacies of the usual approximation for interpolating between the para- and ferro-magnetic states and present an accurate new interpolation formula. A Padé approximant technique is used to accurately interpolate the recent Monte Carlo results (para and ferro) of Ceperley and Alder into the important range of densities for atoms, molecules, and metals. These results can be combined with the RPA spin-dependence so as to produce a correlation energy for a spin-polarized homogeneous electron gas with an estimated maximum error of 1 mRy and thus should reliably determine the magnitude of non-local corrections to the local spin density approximation in real systems. }

title={Experimental discrimination of ion stopping models near the Bragg peak in highly ionized matter},
journal={Nature Communications},
year={2017},
volume={8},
number={1},
pages={15693},
abstract={The energy deposition of ions in dense plasmas is a key process in inertial confinement fusion that determines the a-particle heating expected to trigger a burn wave in the hydrogen pellet and resulting in high thermonuclear gain. However, measurements of ion stopping in plasmas are scarce and mostly restricted to high ion velocities where theory agrees with the data. Here, we report experimental data at low projectile velocities near the Bragg peak, where the stopping force reaches its maximum. This parameter range features the largest theoretical uncertainties and conclusive data are missing until today. The precision of our measurements, combined with a reliable knowledge of the plasma parameters, allows to disprove several standard models for the stopping power for beam velocities typically encountered in inertial fusion. On the other hand, our data support theories that include a detailed treatment of strong ion-electron collisions.},

The collectively scattered Cl Ly-α x-ray line at 2.96keV shows up- and down-shifted plasmon signals. From the detailed balance relation, i.e., the ratio of the up-shifted to the down-shifted plasmon intensities, the plasma temperature can be determined independent of model assumptions. Results are shown for an experiment in which a temperature of 18eV was measured. Using detailed balance for temperature measurement will be important to validate models that calculate the static ion–ion structure factor Sii(k).}

	abstract = {Hydrogen-helium mixtures at conditions of Jupiter’s interior are studied with first-principles computer simulations. The resulting equation of state (EOS) implies that Jupiter possesses a central core of 14-18 Earth masses of heavier elements, a result that supports core accretion as the standard model for the formation of hydrogen-rich giant planets. Our nominal model has about 4 Earth masses of planetary ices in the H-He-rich mantle, a result that is, within a modeling uncertainty of 6 Earth masses, consistent with abundances measured by the 1995 Galileo entry probe mission, suggesting that the composition found by the probe may be representative of the entire planet. Interior models derived from this first-principles EOS do not give a match to Jupiter’s gravity moment J4 unless one invokes interior differential rotation, implying that Jovian interior dynamics has an observable effect on the high-order gravity field.}

ABSTRACT = {European XFEL is a free-electron laser (FEL) user facility providing soft and hard X-ray FEL radiation to initially six scientific instruments. Starting user operation in fall 2017 European XFEL will provide new research opportunities to users from science domains as diverse as physics, chemistry, geo- and planetary sciences, materials sciences or biology. The unique feature of European XFEL is the provision of high average brilliance in the soft and hard X-ray regime, combined with the pulse properties of FEL radiation of extreme peak intensities, femtosecond pulse duration and high degree of coherence. The high average brilliance is achieved through acceleration of up to 27,000 electron bunches per second by the super-conducting electron accelerator. Enabling the usage of this high average brilliance in user experiments is one of the major instrumentation drivers for European XFEL. The radiation generated by three FEL sources is distributed via long beam transport systems to the experiment hall where the scientific instruments are located side-by-side. The X-ray beam transport systems have been optimized to maintain the unique features of the FEL radiation which will be monitored using build-in photon diagnostics. The six scientific instruments are optimized for specific applications using soft or hard X-ray techniques and include integrated lasers, dedicated sample environment, large area high frame rate detector(s) and computing systems capable of processing large quantities of data.}

abstract = {Several sum rules and other exact relations are employed to determine both the static and the dynamic properties of strongly coupled, partially and completely degenerate one-component plasmas. Emphasis is placed on the electron gas, both at zero and finite temperatures. The procedure is based on the self-consistent method of moments, recently developed in Phys. Rev. Lett., 2017, 119, 045001, that provides a neat expression for the loss function valid at strong couplings. An input value of the method in its classical version is the static structure factor, whose accuracy is shown to insignificantly affect the resulting numerical data. Starting from the Cauchy-Bunyakovsky-Schwarz inequality, a criterion is proposed to verify the quality of various approaches to the evaluation of the static characteristics of one-component, strongly coupled plasmas.},

volume={12},
number={4},
pages={215-220},
abstract={The time--energy information of ultrashort X-ray free-electron laser pulses generated by the Linac Coherent Light Source is measured with attosecond resolution via angular streaking of neon 1s photoelectrons. The X-ray pulses promote electrons from the neon core level into an ionization continuum, where they are dressed with the electric field of a circularly polarized infrared laser. This induces characteristic modulations of the resulting photoelectron energy and angular distribution. From these modulations we recover the single-shot attosecond intensity structure and chirp of arbitrary X-ray pulses based on self-amplified spontaneous emission, which have eluded direct measurement so far. We characterize individual attosecond pulses, including their instantaneous frequency, and identify double pulses with well-defined delays and spectral properties, thus paving the way for X-ray pump/X-ray probe attosecond free-electron laser science.},

	abstract = {We present a practical analysis of the fermion sign problem in fermionic path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations in the grand-canonical ensemble (GCE). As a representative model system, we consider electrons in a 2D harmonic trap. We find that the sign problem in the GCE is even more severe than in the canonical ensemble at the same conditions, which, in general, makes the latter the preferred option. Despite these difficulties, we show that fermionic PIMC simulations in the GCE are still feasible in many cases, which potentially gives access to important quantities like the compressibility or the Matsubara Greens function. This has important implications for contemporary fields of research such as warm dense matter, ultracold atoms, and electrons in quantum dots.}

abstract = {Extreme conditions inside ice giants such as Uranus and Neptune can result in peculiar chemistry and structural transitions, e.g., the precipitation of diamonds or superionic water, as so far experimentally observed only for pure C─H and H2O systems, respectively. Here, we investigate a stoichiometric mixture of C and H2O by shock-compressing polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastics and performing in situ x-ray probing. We observe diamond formation at pressures between 72 ± 7 and 125 ± 13 GPa at temperatures ranging from ~3500 to ~6000 K. Combining x-ray diffraction and small-angle x-ray scattering, we access the kinetics of this exotic reaction. The observed demixing of C and H2O suggests that diamond precipitation inside the ice giants is enhanced by oxygen, which can lead to isolated water and thus the formation of superionic structures relevant to the planets’ magnetic fields. Moreover, our measurements indicate a way of producing nanodiamonds by simple laser-driven shock compression of cheap PET plastics. Laser compression of PET plastics mimics the chemistry inside Uranus and may offer a way to simply produce nanodiamonds.}}

abstract={Stable bound quantum states are ubiquitous in nature. Mostly, they result from the interaction of only pairs of particles, so called two-body interactions, even when large complex many-particle structures are formed. We show that three-particle bound states occur in a generic, experimentally accessible solid state system: antiferromagnetic spin ladders, related to high-temperature superconductors. This binding is induced by genuine three-particle interactions; without them there is no bound state. We compute the dynamic exchange structure factor required for the experimental detection of the predicted state by resonant inelastic X-ray scattering for realistic material parameters. Our work enables us to quantify these elusive interactions and unambiguously establishes their effect on the dynamics of the quantum many-particle state.},

abstract={Behavior of quantum liquids is a fascinating topic in physics. Even in a strongly correlated case, the linear response of a given system to an external field is described by the fluctuation-dissipation relations based on the two-body correlations in the equilibrium. However, to explore nonlinear non-equilibrium behaviors of the system beyond this well-established regime, the role of higher order correlations starting from the three-body correlations must be revealed. In this work, we experimentally investigate a controllable quantum liquid realized in a Kondo-correlated quantum dot and prove the relevance of the three-body correlations in the nonlinear conductance at finite magnetic field, which validates the recent Fermi liquid theory extended to the non-equilibrium regime.},

  shorttitle = {Beyond the {{GW}} approximation},
  abstract = {In many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) the self-energy Σ=iGWΓ plays a key role since it contains all the many-body effects of the system. The exact self-energy is not known; as a first approximation one can set the vertex function Γ to unity which leads to the GW approximation. The latter properly describes the high-density regime, where screening is important; in the low-density regime, instead, other approximations are proposed, such as the T matrix, which describes multiple scattering between two particles. Here we combine the two approaches. Starting from the fundamental equations of MBPT, we show how one can derive the T-matrix approximation to the self-energy in a common framework with GW. This allows us to elucidate several aspects of this formulation, including the origin of, and link between, the electron-hole and the particle-particle T matrix, the derivation of a screened T matrix, and the conversion of the T matrix into a vertex correction. The exactly solvable Hubbard molecule is used for illustration.},

	abstract = {Achieving a power envelope of few milliwatts combined with tight performance constraints is emerging as one of the key challenges for battery-powered and low cost Internet-of-things (IoT) end-nodes. IoT devices have to cope with highly time-varying workloads, characterized by intermittent “race-to-sleep” bursts of compute-intensive operations mingled with long periods of low activity. Architectural heterogeneity provides a possible solution to harmonize these competing constraints; the availability of diverse cores optimized for diverse tasks, but able to run the same code is advantageous for IoT devices. In this paper, we introduce Zero-riscy and Micro-riscy, two novel RISC-V cores targeting mixed arithmetic/control applications and control-oriented tasks respectively. We compare them with the DSP-enhanced open-source Riscy core [1]. Zero-riscy is 2.2× smaller than Riscy and provides a 2× energy boost for mixed control/arithmetic code with limited DSP. Micro-riscy is 1.6× smaller than Zero-riscy ( 11.6 kgates in UMC 65nm), has a power envelope of just 100μW at 160MHz and it is 1.4× more energy efficient than Zero-riscy on pure control code.},

	doi = {10.1109/AERO.2008.4526293},
	abstract = {As advances in technology make payloads and instruments for space missions smaller, lighter, and more power efficient, a niche market is emerging from the university community to perform rapidly developed, low-cost missions on very small spacecraft - micro, nano, and picosatellites. Among this class of spacecraft, are CubeSats, with a basic form of 10 times 10 times 10 cm, weighing a maximum of 1kg. In order to serve as viable alternative to larger spacecraft, small satellite platforms must provide the end user with access to space and similar functionality to mainstream missions. However, despite recent advances, small satellites have not been able to reach their full potential. Without launch vehicles dedicated to launching small satellites as primary payloads, launch opportunities only exist in the form of co-manifest or secondary payload missions, with launches often subsidized by the government. In addition, power, size, and mass constraints create additional hurdles for small satellites. To date, the primary method of increasing a small satellite's capability has been focused on miniaturization of technology. The CubeSat Program embraces this approach, but has also focused on developing an infrastructure to offset unavoidable limitations caused by the constraints of small satellite missions. The main components of this infrastructure are: an extensive developer community, standards for spacecraft and launch vehicle interfaces, and a network of ground stations. This paper will focus on the CubeSat Program, its history, and the philosophy behind the various elements that make it a practical an enabling alternative for access to space.},

	abstract = {High performance and energy efficiency are critical requirements for Internet of Things (IoT) end-nodes. Exploiting tightly coupled clusters of programmable processors (CMPs) has recently emerged as a suitable solution to address this challenge. One of the main bottlenecks limiting the performance and energy efficiency of these systems is the instruction cache architecture due to its criticality in terms of timing (i.e., maximum operating frequency), bandwidth, and power. We propose a hierarchical instruction cache tailored to ultralow-power (ULP) tightly coupled processor clusters where a relatively large cache (L1.5) is shared by L1 private (PR) caches through a two-cycle latency interconnect. To address the performance loss caused by the L1 capacity misses, we introduce a next-line prefetcher with cache probe filtering (CPF) from L1 to L1.5. We optimize the core instruction fetch (IF) stage by removing the critical core-to-L1 combinational path. We present a detailed comparison of instruction cache architectures’ performance and energy efficiency for parallel ULP (PULP) clusters. Focusing on the implementation, our two-level instruction cache provides better scalability than existing shared caches, delivering up to 20\% higher operating frequency. On average, the proposed two-level cache improves maximum performance by up to 17\% compared to the state-of-the-art while delivering similar energy efficiency for most relevant applications.},

Energetic particles, mostly electrons and protons, can annihilate or cause space craft hardware failures. The standard practice in space electronics is the utilization of aluminum as radiation safeguard and structural enclosure. In space, the materials must be lightweight and capable of withstanding extreme temperature/mechanical loads under harsh environments, so the research has focused on advanced multi-functional materials. In this regard, low-Z materials have been found effective in shielding particle radiation, but their structural properties were not sufficient for the desired space applications. As a solution, polymeric composites or nanocomposites have been produced having enhanced material properties and enough radiation shielding (gamma, cosmic, X-rays, protons, neutrons, etc.) properties along with reduced weight. Advantageously, the polymeric composites or nanocomposites can be layered to form multi-layered shields. Hence, polymer composites/nanocomposites offer promising alternatives to developing materials for efficiently attenuating photon or particle radiation. The latest technology developments for micro/nano reinforced polymer composites/nanocomposites have also been surveyed here for the radiation shielding of space crafts and aerospace structures. Moreover, the motive behind this state-of-the-art overview is to put forward recommendations for high performance design/applications of reinforced nanocomposites towards future radiation shielding technology in the spacecraft.},

Our soft error rate (SER) estimation method propagates both frequency (expressed as probability) and intensity as the width of single event transient (SET) pulses expressed as probability density functions through the circuit. With this model we are able to accurately model electrical masking factors in logic circuits. Also, the error pulse width density information at primary outputs of the logic circuit allows evaluation of SER reduction schemes such as time or space redundancy.},

            While microprocessors are used in various applications, they are precluded from the use in high-energy physics applications due to the harsh radiation present. To overcome this limitation a microprocessor design must withstand high doses of radiation and mitigate radiation induced soft errors. A TMR protection scheme is applied to protect a RISC-V microprocessor core against these faults. The protection of the integrated SRAM by an independent scrubbing algorithm is discussed. Initial irradiation results and power consumption measurements of the radiation-resistant RISC-V microprocessor implemented in 65 nm CMOS technology are presented.},

	abstract = {The advent of commercial-of-the-shelf (COTS) heterogeneous many-core platforms is opening up a series of opportunities in the embedded computing market. Integrating multiple computing elements running at lower frequencies allows obtaining impressive performance capabilities at a reduced power consumption. These platforms can be successfully adopted to build the next-generation of self-driving vehicles, where Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) need to process unprecedently higher computing workloads at low power budgets. Unfortunately, the current methodologies for providing real-time guarantees are uneffective when applied to the complex architectures of modern many-cores. Having impressive average performances with no guaranteed bounds on the response times of the critical computing activities is of little if no use to these applications. Project HERCULES will provide the required technological infrastructure to obtain an order-of-magnitude improvement in the cost and power consumption of next generation automotive systems. This paper presents the integrated software framework of the project, which allows achieving predictable performance on top of cutting-edge heterogeneous COTS platforms. The proposed software stack will let both real-time and non real-time application coexist on next-generation, power-efficient embedded platform, with preserved timing guarantees.},

	abstract = {Transient faults or soft errors are considered one of the most daunting reliability challenges for microprocessors. Software solutions for soft error protection are attractive because they can provide flexible and effective error protection. For instance, nZDC [1] state-of-the-art instruction duplication error protection scheme achieves a high degree of error detection by verifying the results of memory write operations and utilizes an effective control-flow checking mechanism. However, nZDC control-flow checking mechanism is architecture-dependent and suffers from some vulnerability holes. In this work, we address these issues by substituting nZDC control-flow checking mechanism with a general (ISA-independent) scheme and propose two transformations, coarse-grained scheduling and asymmetric control-flow signatures, for hard-to-detect control flow errors. Fault injection experiments on different hardware components of synthesizable Verilog description of an OpenRISC-based microprocessor reveal that the proposed transformation shows 85\% less silent data corruptions compared to nZDC. In addition, programs protected by the proposed scheme run on average around 37\% faster than nZDC-protected programs.},

These charge pulses are then related to typical computer large-scale integrated circuit components and cosmic-ray-induced errors are estimated. The effects of shielding (such as building ceilings and walls), altitude, and solar cycle are estimated. Cosmic-ray nucleons and muons can cause errors in current memories at a level of marginal significance, and there may be a very significant effect in the next generation of computer memory circuitry.

	abstract = {Silicon-On-lnsulator (SOI) has long been recognized to provide inherent resistance to transient ionizing radiation effects due to the isolation from the substrate. The buried insulating layer (buried oxide BOX) is also known to introduce problematic considerations for total ionizing dose (TID) radiation effects, particularly for fully-depleted (FD) SOI. Recent work in characterization of TID effects in partially depleted (PD) SOI indicates that the inherently high doping levels of the body region result in insensitivity to TID. The pros and cons generally apply to all SOI-based technologies, including thin-film CMOS as well as thick film bipolar, LDMOS, and power MOSFETs. Space and military devices continue to be an opportunity for thin and thick SOI devices where the BOX limits global photocurrents in high dose-rate environments, and local photocurrents in heavy-ion space environments. At the same time, single-event effects (SEE) have become an increasing reliability concern in terrestrial electronics, particularly in sub-65 nm CMOS circuits. Small amounts of charge representing each bit of information, high clock speeds, low operating voltages, and high packing densities all exacerbate the sensitivity to ionizing particles. Terrestrial neutron effects, and more recently direct ionization by protons and muons, are significant considerations in present and emerging electronic devices, motivating a closer look at SEE in ultra-thin (UT) FDSOI.},

However, their adoption on ultra-low-power multi-core microcontroller (MCU) platforms requires minimizing the overheads of work-sharing constructs on fine-grained parallel regions. This work tackles this challenge by proposing OMP-SPMD, a streamlined approach for parallel computing enabling the OpenMP syntax for the Single-Program Multiple-Data (SPMD) paradigm. To assess the performance improvement, we compare our solution with two alternatives: a baseline implementation of the OpenMP runtime based on the fork-join paradigm (OMP-base) and a version leveraging hardware-specific optimizations (OPM-opt). We benchmarked these libraries on a Parallel Ultra-Low Power (PULP) MCU, highlighting that hardware-specific optimizations improve OMP-base performance up to 69\%. At the same time, OMP-SPMD leads to an extra improvement up to 178\%.},

	abstract = {Deeply scaled CMOS circuits are vulnerable to soft and hard errors. These errors pose reliability concerns, especially for systems used in radiation-prone environments like space and nuclear applications. This paper presents SHAKTI-F, a RISC-V based SEE-tolerant micro-processor architecture that provides a solution to the reliability issues mentioned above. The proposed architecture uses error correcting codes (ECC) to tolerate errors in registers and memories, while it employs a combination of space and time redundancy based techniques to tolerate errors in the ALU. Two novel re-computation techniques for detecting errors for the addition/subtraction and multiplication modules are proposed. The scheme also identifies parts of the circuitry that need to be radiation hardened thus providing a total protection to SEEs. The proposed scheme provides fine-grain error detection capability that help in localization of the error to a specific functional unit and isolating the same, rather than the entire processor or a large module within a processor. This provides a graceful degradation and/or fail-safe shutdown capability to the processor. The HDL model of the processor was validated by simulating it with randomly induced SEEs. The proposed scheme adds an extra penalty of only 20\% on the core area and 25\% penalty on the performance when compared with conventional systems. This is very less when compared to the penalty incurred by employing schemes including double modular and triple modular redundancy. Interestingly, there is a 45\% reduction in power consumption due to introduction of fault tolerance. The resulting system runs at 330 MHz on a 55nm technology node, which is sufficient for the class of applications these cores are utilized for.},

This need is driving the development of two new radiation-hardened, multi-core space processors, the BAE Systems RAD5545™ processor and the Boeing High-Performance Spaceflight Computing (HPSC) processor. As these systems remained in the development phase, the Freescale P5020DS and P5040DS systems, based on the same PowerPC e5500 architecture as the RAD5545 processor, and the Hardkernel ODROID-C2, sharing the same ARM Cortex-A53 core as the HPSC processor, were selected as facsimiles for evaluation. Several OpenMP-parallelized applications, including a color search, Sobel filter, Mandelbrot set generator, hyperspectral imaging target classifier, and image thumbnailer, were benchmarked on these processing platforms. Performance and energy consumption results on these facsimiles were scaled to forecasted frequencies of the radiation-hardened devices in development. In these studies, the RAD5545 achieved the highest and most consistent parallel efficiency, up to 99\%. The HPSC processor achieved faster execution times, averaging about half that of the RAD5545 processor, with lower energy consumption. The evaluated applications reached up to 3.9 speedup across four cores. The frequency-scaling methods were validated by comparing the set of scaled measures with data points from an underclocked facsimile, which yielded an average accuracy of 97\% between estimated and measured results. These performance outcomes help to establish the capabilities of both the RAD5545 and HPSC processors for on-board parallel processing of computationally-demanding applications for future space missions.},

	abstract = {The steeply growing performance demands for highly power- and energy-constrained processing systems such as end-nodes of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) have led to parallel near-threshold computing (NTC), joining the energy-efficiency benefits of low-voltage operation with the performance typical of parallel systems. Shared-L1-memory multiprocessor clusters are a promising architecture, delivering performance in the order of GOPS and over 100 GOPS/W of energy-efficiency. However, this level of computational efficiency can only be reached by maximizing the effective utilization of the processing elements (PEs) available in the clusters. Along with this effort, the optimization of PE-to-PE synchronization and communication is a critical factor for performance. In this article, we describe a light-weight hardware-accelerated synchronization and communication unit (SCU) for tightly-coupled clusters of processors. We detail the architecture, which enables fine-grain per-PE power management, and its integration into an eight-core cluster of RISC-V processors. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution, we implemented the eight-core cluster in advanced 22 nm FDX technology and evaluated performance and energy-efficiency with tunable microbenchmarks and a set of real-life applications and kernels. The proposed solution allows synchronization-free regions as small as 42 cycles, over 41× smaller than the baseline implementation based on fast test-and-set access to L1 memory when constraining the microbenchmarks to 10 percent synchronization overhead. When evaluated on the real-life DSP-applications, the proposed SCU improves performance by up to 92 and 23 percent on average and energy efficiency by up to 98 and 39 percent on average.},

	abstract = {Aggressive technology scaling provides designers with an ever increasing budget of cheaper and faster transistors. Unfortunately, this trend is accompanied by a decline in individual device reliability as transistors become increasingly susceptible to soft errors. We are quickly approaching a new era where resilience to soft errors is no longer a luxury that can be reserved for just processors in high-reliability, mission-critical domains. Even processors used in mainstream computing will soon require protection. However, due to tighter profit margins, reliable operation for these devices must come at little or no cost. This paper presents Shoestring, a minimally invasive software solution that provides high soft error coverage with very little overhead, enabling its deployment even in commodity processors with "shoestring" reliability budgets. Leveraging intelligent analysis at compile time, and exploiting low-cost, symptom-based error detection, Shoestring is able to focus its efforts on protecting statistically-vulnerable portions of program code. Shoestring effectively applies instruction duplication to protect only those segments of code that, when subjected to a soft error, are likely to result in user-visible faults without first exhibiting symptomatic behavior. Shoestring is able to recover from an additional 33.9\% of soft errors that are undetected by a symptom-only approach, achieving an overall user-visible failure rate of 1.6\%. This reliability improvement comes at a modest performance overhead of 15.8\%.},

Programs repeatedly execute the same instructions within close time periods. This can be viewed as a time redundant re-execution of a program, except that inputs to these inherent time redundant (ITR) instructions vary. Nevertheless, certain microarchitectural events in the processor are independent of the input and only depend on the program instructions. Such events can be recorded and confirmed when ITR instructions repeat.},

	abstract = {Endpoint devices for Internet-of-Things not only need to work under extremely tight power envelope of a few milliwatts, but also need to be flexible in their computing capabilities, from a few kOPS to GOPS. Near-threshold (NT) operation can achieve higher energy efficiency, and the performance scalability can be gained through parallelism. In this paper, we describe the design of an open-source RISC-V processor core specifically designed for NT operation in tightly coupled multicore clusters. We introduce instruction extensions and microarchitectural optimizations to increase the computational density and to minimize the pressure toward the shared-memory hierarchy. For typical data-intensive sensor processing workloads, the proposed core is, on average, 3.5× faster and 3.2× more energy efficient, thanks to a smart L0 buffer to reduce cache access contentions and support for compressed instructions. Single Instruction Multiple Data extensions, such as dot products, and a built-in L0 storage further reduce the shared-memory accesses by 8× reducing contentions by 3.2×. With four NT-optimized cores, the cluster is operational from 0.6 to 1.2 V, achieving a peak efficiency of 67 MOPS/mW in a low-cost 65-nm bulk CMOS technology. In a low-power 28-nm FD-SOI process, a peak efficiency of 193 MOPS/mW (40 MHz and 1 mW) can be achieved.},

	abstract = {Radiation can affect the correct behavior of an electronic device. Hence, the microprocessors used for space missions need to be protected against fault. TMR (Triple modular redundancy) is used for mitigating various kinds of faults in an electronic circuit. Although TMR provides an excellent level of reliability, it takes a large area and suffers from high power consumption. To reduce the area and power overheads DMR (double modular redundancy) is used. The DMR approach significantly reduces the resource overhead but it also reduces the performance by imposing timing penalty. Various methods have been proposed since the incarnation of TMR and DMR, but the resource overhead is still a challenging issue. Hence, in this work, a new DMR based reconfigurable quad-core RV32IM processor architecture is proposed for fault-tolerant applications. Depending upon the environment of operation and application sensitivity, the designed processor can be reconfigured to work either in normal mode or fault-tolerant mode. The novelty of the proposed architecture is that the reconfigurable feature reduces the resource overhead and makes the processor energy-efficient by optimally using all four processor cores to provide fault-tolerant results. The proposed computing architecture is designed using Verilog HDL(Hardware Description Language) and synthesized on 32nm CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor) process technology node using Synopsys Design Compiler EDA (Electronic Design Automation) tool. Compared to unprotected design, the synthesis tool reports -21.75\% reduction in power with a time penalty of +9.96\% and area overhead of +17.89\% for the proposed fault-tolerant approach. Compared to the state-of-the-art fault-tolerant computing system, the proposed design achieves -2.26\% low area overhead with its reliability intact as DMR. Further, the proposed processor is prototyped and tested on FPGA (field-programmable gate array) with fault-injection using SEM (soft error mitigation) IP core.},

	abstract = {Safety-relevant systems in the automotive domain often implement features such as lockstep execution for error detection, and reset and re-execution for error correction. Light-lockstep has already been adopted in some such systems due to its relatively low-implementation cost given that it does not require deep changes into nonlockstep hardware. Instead, as only off-core activities (i.e., data/addresses sent) need to be compared across different cores, light-lockstep designs are lowly intrusive. This approach has been proven sufficient to guarantee functional correctness of the system in the presence of errors in the cores, in particular in relation with certification against safety standards such as ISO26262 in the automotive domain. However, error detection in light-lockstep systems may occur long after the error actually occurs, thus jeopardizing timing guarantees, which are as critical as functional ones in hard real-time systems. In this paper, we analyze the timing behavior of errors due to transient and permanent faults in light-lockstep systems. Our results show that the time elapsed until an error is detected can be inordinately large, especially for permanent faults. Based on this observation and building upon the specific characteristics of light-lockstep systems, we propose lightly verbose (LiVe), a new mechanism to enforce the early detection of errors, due to both transient and permanent faults, thus enabling the computation of tight error detection timing bounds. We also analyze how existing mechanisms for error recovery in multicore systems increase their effectiveness when light-lockstep operates in LiVe mode in the context of mixed-criticality workloads.},

The ODRG unit adds less than 11\% of a core's area for a three-core group, or a total of 1\% of the cluster area, and shows negligible timing increase, which compares favorably to a commercial state-of-the-art implementation, and is \$2.5{\textbackslash}times\$ faster in fault recovery re-synchronization.

The program code runs on both processor cores when software is executed in performance mode. While in lockstep mode both processor pipelines appear as one to the software. Switching between both modes happens seamlessly and neither software interrupt nor processor reset is required. Our concept of an adaptive lockstep architecture is demonstrated by extending the Cobham Gaisler’s LEON3 processor. The evaluation shows a reasonable hardware overhead as well as a minimal runtime overhead due to the additional pipeline stage.},

	abstract = {Automotive functional safety standard ISO 26262 aims to avoid unreasonable risks due to systematic failures and random hardware failures caused by malfunctioning behavior. Automotive functions involve distributed end-to-end computation in automotive cyber-physical systems (ACPSs). The automotive industry is highly cost-sensitive to the mass market. This study presents a resource-cost-aware fault-tolerant design methodology for end-to-end functional safety computation on ACPSs. The proposed design methodology involves early functional safety requirement verification and late resource cost design optimization. We first propose the functional safety requirement verification (FSRV) method to verify the functional safety requirement consisting of reliability and response time requirements of the distributed automotive function during the early design phase. We then propose the resource-cost-aware fault-tolerant optimization (RCFO) method to reduce the resource cost while satisfying the functional safety requirement of the function during the late design phase. Finally, we perform experiments with real-life automotive and synthetic automotive functions. Findings reveal that the proposed RCFO and VFSR methods demonstrate satisfactory resource cost reduction compared with other methods while satisfying the functional safety requirement.},

We use abstraction-based controller synthesis approach to design a formally verified controller that provides application and system-level fault tolerance along with safety guarantee. Moreover, our approach is implementable using a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) processing unit. To demonstrate the efficacy of our solution and to verify the safety of the system under various types of faults injected in applications and in the underlying real-time operating system (RTOS), we implemented the proposed controller for the inverted pendulum and three degrees-of-freedom (3-DOF) helicopter.},

As the semiconductor process nodes keep shrinking, the DCLS technique is also more and more frequently seen in industrial or even consumer electronics. The paper presents the novel approach to the DCLS technique. While the typical approach is to set the slave core delay as a fixed number of clock cycles, we allow the checker core to run freely behind the main core within the constrained boundaries of clock cycles. This increases the temporal diversity needed for common mode failure mitigation. The system integrity provided by DCLS may also be used in the area of security applications. In this paper, we show that the proposed Variable Delayed Dual-Core Lockstep technique can flatten the power consumption correlation between the running cores, essential for a wide range of attacks. The proposed technique was implemented in the RISC-V processor core and verified in the Xilinx VCU108 FPGA platform.},

Signiﬁcant work has been done on gate and microarchitecture level triple modular redundancy, and on functional redundancy in multi-core and simultaneous-multi-threading processors, whereas little has been done to quantify the fault tolerance potential of interleaved-multi-threading. In this study, we apply the temporal-spatial triple modular redundancy concept to interleaved-multi-threading processors through a design solution that we call Buffered triple modular redundancy, using the soft-core Klessydra-T03 as the basis for our experiments. We then illustrate the quantitative ﬁndings of a large fault-injection simulation campaign on the fault-tolerant core and discuss the vulnerability comparison with previous representative fault-tolerant designs. The results show that the obtained resilience is comparable to a full triple modular redundancy at the cost of execution cycle count overhead instead of hardware overhead, yet with higher achievable clock frequency.},

Core reliability is an important element of the microprocessor’s ability to resist soft errors. This paper proposes DuckCore, a fault-tolerant processor core architecture based on the free and open instruction set architecture (ISA) RISC-V. This architecture uses improved SECDED (single error correction, double error detection) code between pipelines, detects processor operating errors in real-time through the Supervision unit, and takes instruction rollbacks for different error types, which not only saves resources but also improves the reliability of the processor core. In the implementation process, all error injection tests are passed to verify the completeness of the function. In order to better verify the performance of the processor under different error intensity injections, the software is used to inject errors, the running program is run on the FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array), and the impact of the actual radiation environment on the architecture is evaluated through the results. The architecture is applied to three–ﬁve-stage open-source processor cores and the results show that this method consumes fewer resources and its discrete design makes it more portable.},

The focus is on soft errors, which dominate the failure rate of processors in space. Error, failure and propagation models from literature are selected and employed to estimate the failure rate due to soft errors in typical processor designs. A similar approach can be followed for applications with different radiation environments (e.g. automotive, servers, experimental instrumentation exposed to radiation on ground), by adapting the error models. This detailed white-box analysis is possible only for open-source Intellectual Property (IP) cores and in this work it will be applied to several open-source IP cores based on the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). For these case studies, several types of redundancy described in literature for space processors will be evaluated in terms of their cost-effectiveness and expected final in-orbit behavior. This work provides a comprehensive framework to assess efficacy and cost-effectiveness of redundancy, instead of listing and categorizing the techniques described in literature without assessing their relevance to state-of-the-art designs in space applications.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces the ARM Triple Core LockStep (TCLS) architecture, which builds up on the industry success of the ARM Cortex-R5 Dual-Core Lock-Step (DCLS) processor currently used in safety-critical real-time applications. The TCLS architecture adds a third redundant CPU unit to the DCLS Cortex-R5 system to achieve fail functional capabilities and hence increase the availability of the system. The TCLS architecture allows for transparent, quicker and more reliable resynchronization of the CPUs in the event of an error as the erroneous CPU can be identified by comparing its outputs, and the correct architectural state can be restored from one of the other two functionally correct CPUs. The quick resynchronization is also possible because there is no need to correct the state of the cache memories, which are shared and isolated from the CPUs. As the TCLS architecture provides reliability at the system level, individual CPUs do not need to be fault-tolerant, and can be implemented using commercial technology process that provides higher performance, better energy and cost efficiency than rad-hard process technology. The expectation is that the TCLS could increase reliability in the industrial applications where ARM processors are mainstream (e.g., automotive), as well as in new applications where there is currently no presence of ARM technology (e.g., space).},

	abstract = {The Arm Triple Core Lock-Step (TCLS) architecture is the natural evolution of Arm Cortex-R Dual Core Lock-Step (DCLS) processors to increase dependability, predictability, and availability in safety-critical and ultra-reliable applications. TCLS is simple, scalable, and easy to deploy in applications where Arm DCLS processors are widely used (e.g., automotive), as well as in new sectors where the presence of Arm technology is incipient (e.g., enterprise) or almost non-existent (e.g., space). Specifically in space, COTS Arm processors provide optimal power-to-performance, extensibility, evolvability, software availability, and ease of use, especially in comparison with the decades old rad-hard computing solutions that are still in use. This article discusses the fundamentals of an Arm Cortex-R5 based TCLS processor, providing key functioning and implementation details. The article shows that the TCLS architecture keeps the use of rad-hard technology to a minimum, namely, using rad-hard by design standard cell libraries only to protect the critical parts that account for less than 4\% of the entire TCLS solution. Moreover, when exposure to radiation is relatively low, such as in terrestrial applications or even satellites operating in Low Earth Orbits (LEO), the system could be implemented entirely using commercial cell libraries, relying on the radiation mitigation methods implemented on the TCLS to cope with sporadic soft errors in its critical parts. The TCLS solution allows thus to significantly reduce chip manufacturing costs and keep pace with advances in low power consumption and high density integration by leveraging commercial semiconductor processes, while matching the reliability levels and improving availability that can be achieved using extremely expensive rad-hard semiconductor processes. Finally, the article describes a TRL4 proof-of-concept TCLS-based System-on-Chip (SoC) that has been prototyped and tested to power the computer on-board an Airbus Defence and Space telecom satellite. When compared to the currently used processor solution by Airbus, the TCLS-based SoC results in a more than 5× performance increase and cuts power consumption by more than half.},

					Radiation in the space environment poses a constant threat to circuit devices, and, as a solution, several fault tolerance techniques have been developed. However, some techniques use either proprietary technology or radiation-hardening specialized foundries to manufacture, either of which are not easily accessible to most researchers. There is, yet, another set of rad-hard techniques which provide sufficient fault tolerance to specific aerospace applications. The CEVERO SoC is a custom proofof-concept design that implements techniques as lockstep, dual module redundancy and state recovery in its inner fault tolerance module. It is meant to integrate with the open-source PULP platform and to open a path to a full fault-tolerant SoC.},

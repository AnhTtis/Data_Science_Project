\section{Conclusion}\label{section:Conclusion}
In this work, we enhanced a \gls{pulp} cluster with fault-tolerant capabilities introducing a novel Hybrid Modular Redundancy approach. Our solution allows for flexible on-demand dual-core and triple-core lockstep grouping with dynamic runtime split-lock capabilities and hardware/software-based recovery approaches, being the first system to integrate similar functionalities on an open-source RISC-V-based compute device for finely-tunable reliability vs. performance
trade-offs. The hardware-based recovery provides rapid fault recovery in just 24 clock cycles with just $\sim9\%$ area overhead over the baseline implementation, while the software-based recovery takes 363 clock cycles introducing just $1.3\%$ area overhead. The proposed runtime split-lock mechanism allows for entering and exiting one of the available redundant modes with minimal performance loss, allowing execution of mission-critical portions of code or sections requiring performance while otherwise in reliable mode with <300 and <200 cycles of configuration overhead, respectively.

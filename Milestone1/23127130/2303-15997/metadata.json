    "abstract": "We show that the free Burnside groups $B(n,m)$ are infinite for $n\\geq 557$ and $m\\geq 2$. This is the best currently known lower bound for the exponent. The proof uses iterated small cancellation theory where the induction is based on the nesting depth of relators. The main instrument at every step is a new concept of a certification sequence.",

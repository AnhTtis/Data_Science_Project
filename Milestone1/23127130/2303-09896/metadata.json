    "abstract": "Production of exotic states at LHC is considered in the large radius compactification scenario. We envisage a five dimensional theory for a scalar field in five dimensional flat spacetime. It is compactified on a circle, $S^1$, with radius, $R$. The radius is assumed to be in TeV scale appealing to LRC hypothesis. The production of Kaluza-Klein states whose masses lie in the vicinity of TeV range is considered. Instead of appealing to any specific model, bounds on inelastic cross sections and near forward differental cross section are derived from the Lehmann-Symanzik-Zimmermann (LSZ) formulation. We consider decompactified theory should compactification radius be large enough to unravel the fifth spacial dimension in LHC energy scale. Bounds on cross sections are also derived for this scenario. We present bounds on inclusive cross sections for reactions like $a+b\\rightarrow c+X$, X being unobserved states. We plot the bounds as a function of energy and propose that these bounds might be useful for search of exotic states in LHC experiments like ATLAS and CMS.",

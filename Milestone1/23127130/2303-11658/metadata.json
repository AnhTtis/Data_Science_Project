    "abstract": "We adjust the notion of typicality originated with Russell, which was introduced and studied in a previous paper for general first-order structures, to make it expressible in the language of set theory. The adopted definition of the class ${\\rm NT}$ of nontypical sets comes out as a natural strengthening of Russell's initial definition, which employs properties of small (minority) extensions, when the latter are restricted to the various levels $V_ζ$ of $V$. This strengthening leads to defining ${\\rm NT}$ as the class of sets that belong to some countable ordinal definable set. It follows that ${\\rm OD}\\subseteq {\\rm NT}$ and hence ${\\rm HOD}\\subseteq {\\rm HNT}$. It is proved that the class ${\\rm HNT}$ of hereditarily nontypical sets is an inner model of ${\\rm ZF}$. Moreover the (relative) consistency of $V\\neq {\\rm NT}$ is established, by showing that in many forcing extensions $M[G]$ the generic set $G$ is a typical element of $M[G]$, a fact which is fully in accord with the intuitive meaning of typicality. In particular it is consistent that there exist continuum many typical reals. In addition it follows from a result of Kanovei and Lyubetsky that ${\\rm HOD}\\neq {\\rm HNT}$ is also relatively consistent. In particular it is consistent that ${\\cal P}(ω)\\cap {\\rm OD}\\subsetneq{\\cal P}(ω)\\cap {\\rm NT}$. However many questions remain open, among them the consistency of ${\\rm HOD}\\neq {\\rm HNT}\\neq V$, ${\\rm HOD}={\\rm HNT}\\neq V$ and ${\\rm HOD}\\neq {\\rm HNT}= V$.",

abstract="The sliding-window model of computation is motivated by the assumption that, in certain data-stream processing applications, recent data is more useful and pertinent than older data. In such cases, we would like to answer questions about the data only over the last N most recent data elements (N is a parameter). We formalize this model of computation and answer questions about how much space and computation time is required to solve certain problems under the sliding-window model.",

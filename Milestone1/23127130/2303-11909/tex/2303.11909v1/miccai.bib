  abstract  = "We address the problem of 3D rotation equivariance in
               convolutional neural networks. 3D rotations have been a
               challenging nuisance in 3D classification tasks requiring higher
               capacity and extended data augmentation in order to tackle it.
               We model 3D data with multi-valued spherical functions and we
               propose a novel spherical convolutional network that implements
               exact convolutions on the sphere by realizing them in the
               spherical harmonic domain. Resulting filters have local symmetry
               and are localized by enforcing smooth spectra. We apply a novel
               pooling on the spectral domain and our operations are
               independent of the underlying spherical resolution throughout
               the network. We show that networks with much lower capacity and
               without requiring data augmentation can exhibit performance
               comparable to the state of the art in standard 3D shape
               retrieval and classification benchmarks.",

	abstract = {The human fetal period is associated with a rapid emergence of body organ functions and systems, including establishment of the functional brain connectome. In order to characterise developmental features of in-utero functional activity, we introduce a novel perspective on resting-state functional networks, which we call {\textquotedblleft}maturational networks{\textquotedblright}, or {\textquotedblleft}matnets{\textquotedblright}. The key feature of this framework is that it incorporates age-related changes in connectivity into network estimation, thereby characterising functional networks as an emerging property of the brain. We find that fetal matnets reveal several spatially distributed patterns of connections with remarkable anatomical specificity. The framework also enables construction of a whole-brain view of maturational relationships across the early brain{\textquoteright}s functional organisation, which we term the {\textquotedblleft}maturational connectome{\textquotedblright}. We find that the fetal maturational connectome is composed of several groups of maturational networks, among which two groups which are associated with active environmental interaction through perceptual and motor-planning mechanisms, assume a central role.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

   abstract = {There is strong evidence of brain-related abnormalities in COVID-191–13. However, it remains unknown whether the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection can be detected in milder cases, and whether this can reveal possible mechanisms contributing to brain pathology. Here we investigated brain changes in 785 participants of UK Biobank (aged 51–81 years) who were imaged twice using magnetic resonance imaging, including 401 cases who tested positive for infection with SARS-CoV-2 between their two scans—with 141 days on average separating their diagnosis and the second scan—as well as 384 controls. The availability of pre-infection imaging data reduces the likelihood of pre-existing risk factors being misinterpreted as disease effects. We identified significant longitudinal effects when comparing the two groups, including (1) a greater reduction in grey matter thickness and tissue contrast in the orbitofrontal cortex and parahippocampal gyrus; (2) greater changes in markers of tissue damage in regions that are functionally connected to the primary olfactory cortex; and (3) a greater reduction in global brain size in the SARS-CoV-2 cases. The participants who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 also showed on average a greater cognitive decline between the two time points. Importantly, these imaging and cognitive longitudinal effects were still observed after excluding the 15 patients who had been hospitalised. These mainly limbic brain imaging results may be the in vivo hallmarks of a degenerative spread of the disease through olfactory pathways, of neuroinflammatory events, or of the loss of sensory input due to anosmia. Whether this deleterious effect can be partially reversed, or whether these effects will persist in the long term, remains to be investigated with additional follow-up.},

   abstract = {There is growing evidence that preterm children are at an increased risk of poor executive functioning, which underlies behavioural and attention problems. Previous studies have suggested that early cognitive flexibility is a possible predictor of later executive function; however, how it develops in infancy and relates to the later neurobehavioural outcomes is still unclear in the preterm population. Here, we conducted a longitudinal study to investigate oculomotor response shifting in 27 preterm and 25 term infants at 12&nbsp;months and its relationship with general cognitive development and effortful control, which is a temperamental aspect closely associated with executive function, at 18&nbsp;months. We found that moderate to late preterm and term infants significantly inhibited previously rewarded look responses, while very preterm infants did not show significant inhibition of perseverative looking at 12&nbsp;months. Moreover, lower inhibition of perseverative looking was significantly associated with lower general cognitive development and attentional shifting at 18&nbsp;months. These findings suggest that the early atypical patterns of oculomotor response shifting may be a behavioural marker for predicting a higher risk of negative neurobehavioural outcomes, including attention-related problems in preterm children.},

   abstract = {Infants with congenital heart disease are at risk of neurodevelopmental impairments, the origins of which are currently unclear. This study aimed to characterize the relationship between neonatal brain development, cerebral oxygen delivery and neurodevelopmental outcome in infants with congenital heart disease. A cohort of infants with serious or critical congenital heart disease (N = 66; N = 62 born ≥37 weeks) underwent brain MRI before surgery on a 3T scanner situated on the neonatal unit. T2-weighted images were segmented into brain regions using a neonatal-specific algorithm. We generated normative curves of typical volumetric brain development using a data-driven technique applied to 219 healthy infants from the Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP). Atypicality indices, representing the degree of positive or negative deviation of a regional volume from the normative mean for a given gestational age, sex and postnatal age, were calculated for each infant with congenital heart disease. Phase contrast angiography was acquired in 53 infants with congenital heart disease and cerebral oxygen delivery was calculated. Cognitive and motor abilities were assessed at 22 months (N = 46) using the Bayley scales of Infant and Toddler Development-Third Edition. We assessed the relationship between atypicality indices, cerebral oxygen delivery and cognitive and motor outcome. Additionally, we examined whether cerebral oxygen delivery was associated with neurodevelopmental outcome through the mediating effect of brain volume. Negative atypicality indices in deep grey matter were associated with both reduced neonatal cerebral oxygen delivery and poorer cognitive abilities at 22 months across the whole sample. In infants with congenital heart disease born ≥37 weeks, negative cortical grey matter and total tissue volume atypicality indices, in addition to deep grey matter structures, were associated with poorer cognition. There was a significant indirect relationship between cerebral oxygen delivery and cognition through the mediating effect of negative deep grey matter atypicality indices across the whole sample. In infants born ≥37 weeks, cortical grey matter and total tissue volume atypicality indices were also mediators of this relationship. In summary, lower cognitive abilities in toddlers with congenital heart disease were associated with smaller grey matter volumes before cardiac surgery. The aetiology of poor cognition may encompass poor cerebral oxygen delivery leading to impaired grey matter growth. Interventions to improve cerebral oxygen delivery may promote early brain growth and improve cognitive outcomes in infants with congenital heart disease.},

   abstract = {Near-term brain structure was examined in preterm infants in relation to neurodevelopment. We hypothesized that near-term macrostructural brain abnormalities identified using conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and white matter (WM) microstructure detected using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), would correlate with lower cognitive and motor development and slower, less-stable gait at 18–22 mo of age. One hundred and two very-low-birth-weight preterm infants (≤1,500 g birth weight; ≤32 wk gestational age) were recruited prior to routine near-term brain MRI at 36.6 ± 1.8 wk postmenstrual age. Cerebellar and WM macrostructure was assessed on conventional structural MRI. DTI was obtained in 66 out of 102 and WM microstructure was assessed using fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity (MD) in six subcortical brain regions defined by DiffeoMap neonatal atlas. Neurodevelopment was assessed with Bayley-Scales-of-Infant-Toddler-Development, 3rd-Edition (BSID-III); gait was assessed using an instrumented mat. Neonates with cerebellar abnormalities identified using MRI demonstrated lower mean BSID-III cognitive composite scores (89.0 ± 10.1 vs. 97.8 ± 12.4; P = 0.002) at 18–22 mo. Neonates with higher DTI-derived left posterior limb of internal capsule (PLIC) MD demonstrated lower cognitive and motor composite scores (r = −0.368; P = 0.004; r = −0.354; P = 0.006) at 18–22 mo; neonates with higher genu MD demonstrated slower gait velocity (r = −0.374; P = 0.007). Multivariate linear regression significantly predicted cognitive (adjusted r2 = 0.247; P = 0.002) and motor score (adjusted r2 = 0.131; P = 0.017). Near-term cerebellar macrostructure and PLIC and genu microstructure were predictive of early neurodevelopment and gait.},

   abstract = {Aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are associated with progressive brain disorganization. Although structural asymmetry is an organizing feature of the cerebral cortex it is unknown whether continuous age- and AD-related cortical degradation alters cortical asymmetry. Here, in multiple longitudinal adult lifespan cohorts we show that higher-order cortical regions exhibiting pronounced asymmetry at age ~20 also show progressive asymmetry-loss across the adult lifespan. Hence, accelerated thinning of the (previously) thicker homotopic hemisphere is a feature of aging. This organizational principle showed high consistency across cohorts in the Lifebrain consortium, and both the topological patterns and temporal dynamics of asymmetry-loss were markedly similar across replicating samples. Asymmetry-change was further accelerated in AD. Results suggest a system-wide dedifferentiation of the adaptive asymmetric organization of heteromodal cortex in aging and AD. Cortical thickness is asymmetric, and cortical thinning occurs with age and in disease. Here the authors investigate if both cortices thin at the same rate or if the thicker hemisphere declines faster in aging and in Alzheimer’s disease.},

   abstract = {Brain imaging studies have shown that slow and progressive cerebral atrophy characterized the development of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Despite a large number of studies dedicated to AD, key questions about the lifespan evolution of AD biomarkers remain open. When does the AD model diverge from the normal aging model? What is the lifespan trajectory of imaging biomarkers for AD? How do the trajectories of biomarkers in AD differ from normal aging? To answer these questions, we proposed an innovative way by inferring brain structure model across the entire lifespan using a massive number of MRI (N = 4329). We compared the normal model based on 2944 control subjects with the pathological model based on 3262 patients (AD + Mild cognitive Impaired subjects) older than 55 years and controls younger than 55 years. Our study provides evidences of early divergence of the AD models from the normal aging trajectory before 40 years for the hippocampus, followed by the lateral ventricles and the amygdala around 40 years. Moreover, our lifespan model reveals the evolution of these biomarkers and suggests close abnormality evolution for the hippocampus and the amygdala, whereas trajectory of ventricular enlargement appears to follow an inverted U-shape. Finally, our models indicate that medial temporal lobe atrophy and ventricular enlargement are two mid-life physiopathological events characterizing AD brain.},

  abstract = "The principle of equivariance to symmetry transformations enables
              a theoretically grounded approach to neural network architecture
              design. Equivariant networks have shown excellent performance and
              data efficiency on vision and medical imaging problems that
              exhibit symmetries. Here we show how this principle can be
              extended beyond global symmetries to local gauge transformations.
              This enables the development of a very general class of
              convolutional neural networks on manifolds that depend only on
              the intrinsic geometry, and which includes many popular methods
              from equivariant and geometric deep learning. We implement gauge
              equivariant CNNs for signals defined on the surface of the
              icosahedron, which provides a reasonable approximation of the
              sphere. By choosing to work with this very regular manifold, we
              are able to implement the gauge equivariant convolution using a
              single conv2d call, making it a highly scalable and practical
              alternative to Spherical CNNs. Using this method, we demonstrate
              substantial improvements over previous methods on the task of
              segmenting omnidirectional images and global climate patterns.",

              general domains without the action of a translation group. In
              particular, we propose two constructions, one based upon a
              hierarchical clustering of the domain, and another based on the
              spectrum of the graph Laplacian. We show through experiments that
              for low-dimensional graphs it is possible to learn convolutional
              layers with a number of parameters independent of the input size,
              resulting in efficient deep architectures.",

@article{D.Barch2013,
   abstract = {The primary goal of the Human Connectome Project (HCP) is to delineate the typical patterns of structural and functional connectivity in the healthy adult human brain. However, we know that there are important individual differences in such patterns of connectivity, with evidence that this variability is associated with alterations in important cognitive and behavioral variables that affect real world function. The HCP data will be a critical stepping-off point for future studies that will examine how variation in human structural and functional connectivity play a role in adult and pediatric neurological and psychiatric disorders that account for a huge amount of public health resources. Thus, the HCP is collecting behavioral measures of a range of motor, sensory, cognitive and emotional processes that will delineate a core set of functions relevant to understanding the relationship between brain connectivity and human behavior. In addition, the HCP is using task-fMRI (tfMRI) to help delineate the relationships between individual differences in the neurobiological substrates of mental processing and both functional and structural connectivity, as well as to help characterize and validate the connectivity analyses to be conducted on the structural and functional connectivity data. This paper describes the logic and rationale behind the development of the behavioral, individual difference, and tfMRI batteries and provides preliminary data on the patterns of activation associated with each of the fMRI tasks, at both group and individual levels. © 2013.},

@article{T.Braver1997,
   abstract = {Although recent neuroimaging studies suggest that prefrontal cortex (PFC) is involved in working memory (WM), the relationship between PFC activity and memory load has not yet been well-described in humans. Here we use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to probe PFC activity during a sequential letter task in which memory load was varied in an incremental fashion. In all nine subjects studied, dorsolateral and left inferior regions of PFC were identified that exhibited a linear relationship between activity and WM load. Furthermore, these same regions were independently identified through direct correlations of the fMRI signal with a behavioral measure that indexes WM function during task performance. A second experiment, using whole-brain imaging techniques, both replicated these findings and identified additional brain regions showing a linear relationship with load, suggesting a distributed circuit that participates with PFC in subserving WM. Taken together, these results provide a 'dose-response curve' describing the involvement of both PFC and related brain regions in WM function, and highlight the benefits of using graded, parametric designs in neuroimaging research.},

   abstract = {Predicting the functional sites of a protein from its structure, such as the binding sites of small molecules, other proteins or antibodies, sheds light on its function in vivo. Currently, two classes of methods prevail: machine learning models built on top of handcrafted features and comparative modeling. They are, respectively, limited by the expressivity of the handcrafted features and the availability of similar proteins. Here, we introduce ScanNet, an end-to-end, interpretable geometric deep learning model that learns features directly from 3D structures. ScanNet builds representations of atoms and amino acids based on the spatio-chemical arrangement of their neighbors. We train ScanNet for detecting protein–protein and protein–antibody binding sites, demonstrate its accuracy—including for unseen protein folds—and interpret the filters learned. Finally, we predict epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, validating known antigenic regions and predicting previously uncharacterized ones. Overall, ScanNet is a versatile, powerful and interpretable model suitable for functional site prediction tasks. A webserver for ScanNet is available from http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/ScanNet/ . ScanNet is an end-to-end, interpretable geometric deep learning model that learns spatio-chemical and atomic features directly from protein 3D structures and can be employed for functional site prediction tasks.},

A high-level representation of protein structure, the molecular surface, displays patterns of chemical and geometric features that fingerprint a protein’s modes of interactions with other biomolecules. We hypothesize that proteins participating in similar interactions may share common fingerprints, independent of their evolutionary history. Fingerprints may be difficult to grasp by visual analysis but could be learned from large-scale datasets. We present MaSIF (molecular surface interaction fingerprinting), a conceptual framework based on a geometric deep learning method to capture fingerprints that are important for specific biomolecular interactions. We showcase MaSIF with three prediction challenges: protein pocket-ligand prediction, protein–protein interaction site prediction and ultrafast scanning of protein surfaces for prediction of protein–protein complexes. We anticipate that our conceptual framework will lead to improvements in our understanding of protein function and design. MaSIF, a deep learning-based method, finds common patterns of chemical and geometric features on biomolecular surfaces for predicting protein–ligand and protein–protein interactions.},

To manually label the macroscopic anatomy in magnetic resonance images of 101 healthy participants, we created a new cortical labeling protocol that relies on robust anatomical landmarks and minimal manual edits after initialization with automated labels. The "Desikan-Killiany-Tourville" (DKT) protocol is intended to improve the ease, consistency, and accuracy of labeling human cortical areas. Given how difficult it is to label brains, the Mindboggle-101 dataset is intended to serve as brain atlases for use in labeling other brains, as a normative dataset to establish mor-phometric variation in a healthy population for comparison against clinical populations, and contribute to the development, training, testing, and evaluation of automated registration and labeling algorithms. To this end, we also introduce benchmarks for the evaluation of such algorithms by comparing our manual labels with labels automatically generated by probabilistic and multi-atlas registration-based approaches. All data and related software and updated information are available on the http://mindboggle.info/data website. Copy; 2012 Kleinand Tourville.},

learning of global and local representations that can be transferred to
downstream applications. Inspired by these results, we introduce a novel

dubbed Swin UNEt TRansformers (Swin UNETR), with a hierarchical encoder for
self-supervised pre-training; (ii) tailored proxy tasks for learning the
underlying pattern of human anatomy. We demonstrate successful pre-training of
the proposed model on 5,050 publicly available computed tomography (CT) images
from various body organs. The effectiveness of our approach is validated by
fine-tuning the pre-trained models on the Beyond the Cranial Vault (BTCV)

   abstract = {Large transformer models have shown extraordinary success in achieving
state-of-the-art results in many natural language processing applications.
However, training and deploying these models can be prohibitively costly for
long sequences, as the standard self-attention mechanism of the Transformer
uses $O(n^2)$ time and space with respect to sequence length. In this paper, we
demonstrate that the self-attention mechanism can be approximated by a low-rank
matrix. We further exploit this finding to propose a new self-attention
mechanism, which reduces the overall self-attention complexity from $O(n^2)$ to
$O(n)$ in both time and space. The resulting linear transformer, the
\textit\{Linformer\}, performs on par with standard Transformer models, while
being much more memory- and time-efficient.},

However, the extent to which large-scale networks exhibit their own organized temporal dynamics is unclear. We use an approach designed to find repeating network patterns in whole-brain resting fMRI data, where networks are defined as graphs of interacting brain areas. We find that the transitions between networks are nonrandom, with certain networks more likely to occur after others. Further, this nonrandom sequencing is itself hierarchically organized, revealing two distinct sets of networks, or metastates, that the brain has a tendency to cycle within. One metastate is associated with sensory and motor regions, and the other involves areas related to higher order cognition. Moreover, we find that the proportion of time that a subject spends in each brain network and metastate is a consistent subject-specific measure, is heritable, and shows a significant relationship with cognitive traits.},

   abstract = {Language consists of a hierarchy of linguistic units: words, phrases and sentences. The authors explore whether and how these abstract linguistic units are represented in the brain during speech comprehension. They find that cortical rhythms track the timescales of these linguistic units, revealing a hierarchy of neural processing timescales underlying internal construction of hierarchical linguistic structure. The most critical attribute of human language is its unbounded combinatorial nature: smaller elements can be combined into larger structures on the basis of a grammatical system, resulting in a hierarchy of linguistic units, such as words, phrases and sentences. Mentally parsing and representing such structures, however, poses challenges for speech comprehension. In speech, hierarchical linguistic structures do not have boundaries that are clearly defined by acoustic cues and must therefore be internally and incrementally constructed during comprehension. We found that, during listening to connected speech, cortical activity of different timescales concurrently tracked the time course of abstract linguistic structures at different hierarchical levels, such as words, phrases and sentences. Notably, the neural tracking of hierarchical linguistic structures was dissociated from the encoding of acoustic cues and from the predictability of incoming words. Our results indicate that a hierarchy of neural processing timescales underlies grammar-based internal construction of hierarchical linguistic structure.},

   abstract = {Spoken language, both perception and production, is thought to be facilitated by an ensemble of predictive mechanisms. We obtain intracranial recordings in 37 patients using depth probes implanted along the anteroposterior extent of the supratemporal plane during rhythm listening, speech perception, and speech production. These reveal two predictive mechanisms in early auditory cortex with distinct anatomical and functional characteristics. The first, localized to bilateral Heschl’s gyri and indexed by low-frequency phase, predicts the timing of acoustic events. The second, localized to planum temporale only in language-dominant cortex and indexed by high-gamma power, shows a transient response to acoustic stimuli that is uniquely suppressed during speech production. Chronometric stimulation of Heschl’s gyrus selectively disrupts speech perception, while stimulation of planum temporale selectively disrupts speech production. This work illuminates the fundamental acoustic infrastructure—both architecture and function—for spoken language, grounding cognitive models of speech perception and production in human neurobiology. The human brain fluently parses continuous speech during perception and production. Using direct brain recordings coupled with stimulation, the authors identify separable substrates underlying two distinct predictive mechanisms of “when” in Heschl’s gyrus and “what” in planum temporale.},

   abstract = {Deep learning has recently made remarkable progress in natural language
processing. Yet, the resulting algorithms remain far from competing with the
language abilities of the human brain. Predictive coding theory offers a
potential explanation to this discrepancy: while deep language algorithms are
optimized to predict adjacent words, the human brain would be tuned to make
long-range and hierarchical predictions. To test this hypothesis, we analyze
the fMRI brain signals of 304 subjects each listening to 70min of short
stories. After confirming that the activations of deep language algorithms
linearly map onto those of the brain, we show that enhancing these models with
long-range forecast representations improves their brain-mapping. The results
further reveal a hierarchy of predictions in the brain, whereby the
fronto-parietal cortices forecast more abstract and more distant
representations than the temporal cortices. Overall, this study strengthens
predictive coding theory and suggests a critical role of long-range and
hierarchical predictions in natural language processing.},

that transformers, when equipped with recurrent position encodings, replicate
the precisely tuned spatial representations of the hippocampal formation; most
notably place and grid cells. Furthermore, we show that this result is no

neuroscience. We additionally show the transformer version offers dramatic
performance gains over the neuroscience version. This work continues to bind
computations of artificial and brain networks, offers a novel understanding of
the hippocampal-cortical interaction, and suggests how wider cortical areas may
perform complex tasks beyond current neuroscience models such as language
comprehension.},

   abstract = {The preprocessing pipelines of the Human Connectome Project (HCP) were made publicly available for the neuroimaging community to apply the HCP analytic approach to data from non-HCP sources. The HCP analytic approach is surface-based for the cerebral cortex, uses the CIFTI “grayordinate” file format, provides greater statistical sensitivity than traditional volume-based analysis approaches, and allows for a more neuroanatomically-faithful representation of data. However, the HCP pipelines require the acquisition of specific images (namely T2w and field map) that historically have often not been acquired. Massive amounts of this ‘legacy’ data could benefit from the adoption of HCP-style methods. However, there is currently no published framework, to our knowledge, for adapting HCP preprocessing to “legacy” data. Here we present the ciftify project, a parsimonious analytic framework for adapting key modules from the HCP pipeline into existing structural workflows using FreeSurfer's recon_all structural and existing functional preprocessing workflows. Within this framework, any functional dataset with an accompanying (i.e. T1w) anatomical data can be analyzed in CIFTI format. To simplify usage for new data, the workflow has been bundled with fMRIPrep following the BIDS-app framework. Finally, we present the package and comment on future neuroinformatics advances that may accelerate the movement to a CIFTI-based grayordinate framework.},

   abstract = {UK Biobank is a large-scale prospective epidemiological study with all data accessible to researchers worldwide. It is currently in the process of bringing back 100,000 of the original participants for brain, heart and body MRI, carotid ultrasound and low-dose bone/fat x-ray. The brain imaging component covers 6 modalities (T1, T2 FLAIR, susceptibility weighted MRI, Resting fMRI, Task fMRI and Diffusion MRI). Raw and processed data from the first 10,000 imaged subjects has recently been released for general research access. To help convert this data into useful summary information we have developed an automated processing and QC (Quality Control) pipeline that is available for use by other researchers. In this paper we describe the pipeline in detail, following a brief overview of UK Biobank brain imaging and the acquisition protocol. We also describe several quantitative investigations carried out as part of the development of both the imaging protocol and the processing pipeline.},

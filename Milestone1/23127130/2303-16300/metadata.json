    "abstract": "An operator $T$ on a Hilbert space $\\mathcal H$ is called expansive, if $\\|Tx\\|\\geq \\|x\\|$ ($x\\in\\mathcal H$). It is proves that if an expansive operator $T$ is quasisimilar to the unilateral shift of finite multiplicity $N\\geq 2$, then $I-T^*T$ is of trace class and there exist invariant subspaces $\\mathcal M_j$ ($j=1,\\ldots, N$) of $T$ such that the restriction $T|_{\\mathcal M_j}$ of $T$ on $\\mathcal M_j$ is similar to the unilateral shift of multiplicity $1$ for every $j=1,\\ldots, N$, and $\\mathcal H=\\vee_{j=1}^N\\mathcal M_j$. If an expansive operator $T$ is quasisimilar to the unilateral shift of multiplicity $1$, then $I-T^*T$ is of trace class and there exist invariant subspaces $\\mathcal M_1$ and $\\mathcal M_2$ of $T$ such that the restriction $T|_{\\mathcal M_j}$ of $T$ on $\\mathcal M_j$ is similar to the unilateral shift of multiplicity $1$ for $j=1,2$, and $\\mathcal H=\\mathcal M_1\\vee\\mathcal M_2$.",

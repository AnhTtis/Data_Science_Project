    "abstract": "In this paper, the QCD phase diagram is obtained by the crossing of two effective models: the MIT bag based models are used to describe quark matter and QHD type models to describe hadronic matter, being the use of the former something new to this kind of approach and the latter used with improved parameterizations as compared with previous calculations. We use the Gibbs' conditions to establish the crossing points of the pressure in function of the chemical potential obtained in both phases. We first analyze two-flavour symmetric matter constrained to both the freeze-out and the liquid-gas phase transition at the hadronic phase. Later we analyse the results for $β$-stable and charge neutral stellar matter and compare two different prescriptions: one that assumes flavour conservation, so that the quark phase is completely determined from the hadronic phase, a prescription never applied to finite temperatures before, and the other based on the Maxwell construction, where the quark phase is also $β$-stable. At the end, we compute the latent heat to find a signature of the critical end point.",

journal = {Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter},
abstract = {The realistic description of correlated electron systems took an important step forward a few years ago as the combination of density functional methods and dynamical mean-field theory was conceived. This framework allows access to both high and low energy physics and is capable of the description of the specific physics of strongly correlated materials, like the Mott metal–insulator transition. A very important step in the procedure is the interface between the band structure method and the dynamical mean-field theory and its impurity solver. We present a general interface between a projector augmented-wave-based density functional code and many-body methods based on Wannier functions obtained from a projection on local orbitals. The implementation is very flexible and allows for various applications. Quantities like the momentum-resolved spectral function are accessible. We present applications to SrVO3 and the metal–insulator transition in Ca2 − xSrxRuO4.}

abstract = {In order for methods combining ab initio density-functional theory and many-body techniques to become routinely used, a flexible, fast, and easy-to-use implementation is crucial. We present an implementation of a general charge self-consistent scheme based on projected localized orbitals in the projector augmented wave framework in the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package. We give a detailed description on how the projectors are optimally chosen and how the total energy is calculated. We benchmark our implementation in combination with dynamical mean-field theory: first we study the charge-transfer insulator NiO using a Hartree–Fock approach to solve the many-body Hamiltonian. We address the advantages of the optimized against non-optimized projectors and furthermore find that charge self-consistency decreases the dependence of the spectral function—especially the gap—on the double counting. Second, using continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo we study a monolayer of SrVO3, where strong orbital polarization occurs due to the reduced dimensionality. Using total-energy calculation for structure determination, we find that electronic correlations have a non-negligible influence on the position of the apical oxygens, and therefore on the thickness of the single SrVO3 layer.}

Self-consistent, spin-polarised energy-band calculations based on the local approximation to DF theory are presented in which the magnetisation associated with different atoms in a unit cell is allowed to point along different, non-collinear directions. Non-self consistent calculations employing non-collinear quantisation axes have been presented before; the present calculations are, they believe, distinguished by: first, being self-consistent; second, providing the total energy; and third, providing the spin-quantisation axes. In their first applications they deal with the non-collinear antiferromagnets gamma -FeMn, RhMn3, and PtMn3 and show that their total energies are minimised in the tetrahedral (FeMn) or triangular (RhMn3, PtMn3) magnetic structures first proposed by Kouvel and Kasper (1963).},

abstract = {We present TRIQS/CTHYB, a state-of-the art open-source implementation of the continuous-time hybridisation expansion quantum impurity solver of the TRIQS package. This code is mainly designed to be used with the TRIQS library in order to solve the self-consistent quantum impurity problem in a multi-orbital dynamical mean field theory approach to strongly-correlated electrons, in particular in the context of realistic electronic structure calculations. It is implemented in C++ for efficiency and is provided with a high-level Python interface. The code ships with a new partitioning algorithm that divides the local Hilbert space without any user knowledge of the symmetries and quantum numbers of the Hamiltonian. Furthermore, we implement higher-order configuration moves and show that such moves are necessary to ensure ergodicity of the Monte Carlo in common Hamiltonians even without symmetry-breaking.

    abstract = { Strong electronic correlations are often associated with the proximity of a Mott-insulating state. In recent years however, it has become increasingly clear that the Hund’s rule coupling (intra-atomic exchange) is responsible for strong correlations in multiorbital metallic materials that are not close to a Mott insulator. Hund’s coupling has two effects: It influences the energetics of the Mott gap and strongly suppresses the coherence scale for the formation of a Fermi liquid. A global picture has emerged recently, which emphasizes the importance of the average occupancy of the shell as a control parameter. The most dramatic effects occur away from half-filling or single occupancy. We review the theoretical understanding and physical properties of these Hund’s metals, together with the relevance of this concept to transition-metal oxides (TMOs) of the 3d, and especially 4d, series (such as ruthenates), as well as to the iron-based superconductors (iron pnictides and chalcogenides). }

abstract = {An implementation of full self-consistency over the electronic density in the DFT + DMFT framework on the basis of a plane wave–projector augmented wave (PAW) DFT code is presented. It allows for an accurate calculation of the total energy in DFT + DMFT within a plane wave approach. In contrast to frameworks based on the maximally localized Wannier function, the method is easily applied to f electron systems, such as cerium, cerium oxide (Ce2O3) and plutonium oxide (Pu2O3). In order to have a correct and physical calculation of the energy terms, we find that the calculation of the self-consistent density is mandatory. The formalism is general and does not depend on the method used to solve the impurity model. Calculations are carried out within the Hubbard I approximation, which is fast to solve, and gives a good description of strongly correlated insulators. We compare the DFT + DMFT and DFT + U solutions, and underline the qualitative differences of their converged densities. We emphasize that in contrast to DFT + U, DFT + DMFT does not break the spin and orbital symmetry. As a consequence, DFT + DMFT implies, on top of a better physical description of correlated metals and insulators, a reduced occurrence of unphysical metastable solutions in correlated insulators in comparison to DFT + U.}

title={Spin-orbit-controlled metal--insulator transition in Sr2IrO4},
journal={Nature Physics},

volume={16},
number={3},
pages={290-294},
abstract={In the context of correlated insulators, where electron--electron interactions (U) drive the localization of charge carriers, the metal--insulator transition is described as either bandwidth- or filling-controlled1. Motivated by the challenge of the insulating phase in Sr2IrO4, a new class of correlated insulators has been proposed, in which spin--orbit coupling (SOC) is believed to renormalize the bandwidth of the half-filled jeff = 1/2 doublet, allowing a modest U to induce a charge-localized phase2,3. Although this framework has been tacitly assumed, a thorough characterization of the ground state has been elusive4,5. Furthermore, direct evidence for the role of SOC in stabilizing the insulating state has not been established, because previous attempts at revealing the role of SOC6,7 have been hindered by concurrently occurring changes to the filling8--10. We overcome this challenge by employing multiple substituents that introduce well-defined changes to the signatures of SOC and carrier concentration in the electronic structure, as well as a new methodology that allows us to monitor SOC directly. Specifically, we study Sr2Ir1−xTxO4 (T{\thinspace}={\thinspace}Ru, Rh) by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, combined with ab initio and supercell tight-binding calculations. This allows us to distinguish relativistic and filling effects, thereby establishing conclusively the central role of SOC in stabilizing the insulating state of Sr2IrO4. Most importantly, we estimate the critical value for SOC in this system to be $\lambda$c = 0.42 {\textpm} 0.01{\thinspace}eV, and provide the first demonstration of a spin--orbit-controlled metal--insulator transition.},

        abstract = {The interplay of spin–orbit coupling and Coulomb correlations has become a hot topic in condensed matter theory and is especially important in 4d and 5d transition metal oxides, like iridates or rhodates. Here, we review recent advances in dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT)-based electronic structure calculations for treating such compounds, introducing all necessary implementation details. We also discuss the evaluation of Hubbard interactions in spin–orbit materials. As an example, we perform DMFT calculations on insulating strontium iridate (Sr2IrO4) and its 4d metallic counterpart, strontium rhodate (Sr2RhO4). While a Mott-insulating state is obtained for Sr2IrO4 in its paramagnetic phase, the spectral properties and Fermi surfaces obtained for Sr2RhO4 show excellent agreement with available experimental data. Finally, we discuss the electronic structure of these two compounds by introducing the notion of effective spin–orbital degeneracy as the key quantity that determines the correlation strength. We stress that effective spin–orbital degeneracy introduces an additional axis into the conventional picture of a phase diagram based on filling and on the ratio of interactions to bandwidth, analogous to the degeneracy-controlled Mott transition in d1 perovskites.}

Computing U in the constrained random phase approximation, we investigate noncollinear magnetism of uranium dioxide UO2 and find that the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) stabilizes the 3k ordered magnetic ground state. The estimated SOC strength in UO2 is as large as 0.73 eV per uranium atom, making spin and orbital degrees of freedom virtually inseparable. Using a multipolar pseudospin Hamiltonian, we show how octupolar and dipole-dipole exchange coupling help establish the 3k magnetic ground state with canted ordering of uranium f orbitals. The cooperative Jahn-Teller effect does not appear to play a significant part in stabilizing the noncollinear 3k state, which has the lowest energy even in an undistorted lattice. The choice of parameter U in the LSDA+U model has a notable quantitative effect on the predicted properties of UO2, in particular on the magnetic exchange interaction and, perhaps trivially, on the band gap: The value of U=3.46eV computed fully ab initio delivers the band gap of 2.11 eV in good agreement with experiment, and a balanced account of other pertinent energy scales.},

    "abstract": "Stellar metallicity is a critical factor to characterize the stellar coronae because it directly affects the radiative energy loss from the atmosphere. By extending theoretical relations for solar coronal loops introduced by \\cite{Rosner1978}, we analytically derive scaling relations for stellar coronal loops with various metallicities. In order to validate the derived relations, we also perform magnetohydrodyamic simulations for the heating of coronal loops with different metallicities by changing radiative loss functions according to the adopted elemental abundances. The simulation results nicely explain the generalized analytical scaling relations and show a strong dependence of the thermodynamical and radiative properties of the loops on metallicity. Higher density and temperature are obtained in lower-metallicity coronae because of the inefficient radiative cooling, provided that the surface condition is unchanged. Thus, it is estimated that the X-ray radiation from metal-poor coronae is higher because of their denser coronal gas. The generalized scaling laws can also be used as a tool to study the condition of high-energy radiation around magnetically active stars and their impact on planetary environments.",

    "abstract": "We propose an unconventional nonlinear dynamical Hall effect characteristic of twisted bilayers. The joint action of in-plane and out-of-plane ac electric fields generates Hall currents $\\boldsymbol{j}\\sim\\boldsymbol{\\dot{E}_{\\perp}}\\times\\boldsymbol{E}_{\\parallel}$ in both sum and difference frequencies, and when the two orthogonal fields have common frequency their phase difference controls the on/off, direction and magnitude of the rectified dc Hall current. This novel intrinsic Hall response has a band geometric origin in the momentum space curl of interlayer Berry connection polarizability, arising from layer hybridization of electrons by the twisted interlayer coupling. The effect allows a unique rectification functionality and a transport probe of chiral symmetry in bilayer systems. We show sizable effects in twisted homobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides and twisted bilayer graphene over broad range of twist angles.",

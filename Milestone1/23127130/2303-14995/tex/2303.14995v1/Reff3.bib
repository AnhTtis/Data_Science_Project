  abstract  = {When diffusion is too slow for communication over long distances, cells can use waves of chemical activity. By using fluorescent probes and microscopy, Cheng and Ferrell show that in frog eggs (which are very large cells), waves of apoptotic signals can be seen passing through the egg cytoplasm. The pathways that trigger cell death have positive feedback loops that lead to self-regenerating waves. The speed of the waves (\~{}30 micrometers per minute) is too fast to be explained by diffusion.Science, this issue p. 607Apoptosis is an evolutionarily conserved form of programmed cell death critical for development and tissue homeostasis in animals. The apoptotic control network includes several positive feedback loops that may allow apoptosis to spread through the cytoplasm in self-regenerating trigger waves. We tested this possibility in cell-free Xenopus laevis egg extracts and observed apoptotic trigger waves with speeds of ~30 micrometers per minute. Fractionation and inhibitor studies implicated multiple feedback loops in generating the waves. Apoptotic oocytes and eggs exhibited surface waves with speeds of ~30 micrometers per minute, which were tightly correlated with caspase activation. Thus, apoptosis spreads through trigger waves in both extracts and intact cells. Our findings show how apoptosis can spread over large distances within a cell and emphasize the general importance of trigger waves in cell signaling.},

  abstract = {Fractional calculus, the branch of calculus dealing with derivatives of non-integer order (e.g., the half-derivative) allows the formulation of fractional differential equations (FDEs), which have recently been applied to pharmacokinetics (PK) for one-compartment models. In this work we extend that theory to multi-compartmental models. Unlike systems defined by a single ordinary differential equation (ODE), considering fractional multi-compartmental models is not as simple as changing the order of the ordinary derivatives of the left-hand side of the ODEs to fractional orders. The latter may produce inconsistent systems which violate mass balance. We present a rationale for fractionalization of ODEs, which produces consistent systems and allows processes of different fractional orders in the same system. We also apply a method of solving such systems based on a numerical inverse Laplace transform algorithm, which we demonstrate that is consistent with analytical solutions when these are available. As examples of our approach, we consider two cases of a basic two-compartment PK model with a single IV dose and multiple oral dosing, where the transfer from the peripheral to the central compartment is of fractional order α < 1, accounting for anomalous kinetics and deep tissue trapping, while all other processes are of the usual order 1. Simulations with the studied systems are performed using the numerical inverse Laplace transform method. It is shown that the presence of a transfer rate of fractional order produces a non-exponential terminal phase, while multiple dose and constant infusion systems never reach steady state and drug accumulation carries on indefinitely. The IV fractional system is also fitted to PK data and parameter values are estimated. In conclusion, our approach allows the formulation of systems of FDEs, mixing different fractional orders, in a consistent manner and also provides a method for the numerical solution of these systems.},

The clearance of a substance of interest, (metabolite or drug) from a noncompartmental system will not necessarily be governed by a sum of exponentials or even be describable by a set of ordinary differential equations. The model may involve diffusion or other random walk processes, leading to the solution in terms of the partial differential equation of diffusion or in terms of probability distributions. It may use the theory of linear systems to obviate the need for defining any precise anatomical structure. A number of the models reviewed deal with plasma clearance curves that are best described by power functions of time. Circulatory models are reviewed from their inception to the present. Recent studies on clearance as a fractal process are introduced.},

The elimination half-life from plasma was 1.7±0.1 h. Urinary excretion data revealed a quantitatively minor terminal elimination phase with a half-life of 8.9±0.7 h. After the intravenous dose, metformin was completely excreted unchanged in urine with a renal clearance of 454±47 ml/min. Metformin was not bound to plasma proteins. The concentration of metformin in saliva was considerably lower than in plasma and declined more slowly. The bioavailability of metformin tablets averaged 50-60%. The rate of absorption was slower than that of elimination, which resulted in a plasma concentration profile of “flip-flop” type for oral metformin.},

It discusses weighted least-squares and maximum-likelihood estimators, minimization techniques, significance of optimized parameters and their confidence intervals, and goodness of fit. Coupling of parameter estimation and nonlinear fitting techniques with numerical models provides greater flexibility by allowing different experimental boundary and initial conditions. Many techniques have been developed to solve the nonlinear minimization or maximization problem. Most of these methods are iterative by requiring an initial estimate βi of the unknown parameters to be optimized. Inverse problems used to estimate parameters of the unsaturated soil hydraulic functions are often ill-posed, but can become well-posed in case of well-designed experiments for homogeneous soils with small measurement and model errors. Many curve fitting and/or parameter optimization codes have been developed. One of the most widely used codes is the RETention Curve program for estimating parameters in the soil water retention curve and hydraulic conductivity functions of unsaturated soils.},

  abstract = {Kinetic parameters ol metformin (N,N-dimethylbiguanide), an anti-diabetic reported to be associated with a lower number of episodes of lactic acidosis than phenformin, were determined in volunteers with normal renal function and in patients with different degrees ol renal impairment. Drug in body fluids was measured by a highly specific and sensitive mass fragmentographic method, alter the formation of a triazine derivative, obtained with heptafluorobutyric anhydride. The half-life (t½) for the elimination ol drug from plasma after intravenous injection in 5 normal subjects (1.52 ± 0.3 hr) (mean ± SD) was shorter than that reported for phenformin by a similar assay method (7 to 15 hr). The mean t½ in 5 renal patients was 4.94 ± 1.11 hr, and a correlation was observed between t½ of drug from plasma and creatinine clearance. After oral administration of metlormin tablets, drug recovery in urines was only 37.6%, possibly not as a consequence of low bioavailability (a similar low recovery was found after oral administration of the metformin solution usedlor the intravenous studies), but of binding to the intestinal wall, as shown in animal and clinical studies with metformin and other biguanides. Metformin is rapidly eliminated through active secretion by the kidney (mean renal clearance, 440.8 ml/min)--it is neither metabolized nor protein-bound in plasma. The very brief plasma t½ makes significant cumulation, with a standard tid regimen, unlikely. These findings may help explain the lower incidence of toxic effects, particularly lactic acidosis, than after phenformin.},

  abstract = {Biguanides are a class of drugs widely used as oral antihyperglycemic agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, but they are associated with lactic acidosis, a lethal side effect. We reported previously that biguanides are good substrates of rat organic cation transporter 1 (Oct1; Slc22a1) and, using Oct1(−/−) mice, that mouse Oct1 is responsible for the hepatic uptake of a biguanide, metformin. In the present study, we investigated whether the liver is the key organ for the lactic acidosis. When mice were given metformin, the blood lactate concentration significantly increased in the wild-type mice, whereas only a slight increase was observed in Oct1(−/−) mice. The plasma concentration of metformin exhibited similar time profiles between the wild-type and Oct1(−/−) mice, suggesting that the liver is the key organ responsible for the lactic acidosis. Furthermore, the extent of the increase in blood lactate caused by three different biguanides (metformin, buformin, and phenformin) was compared with the abilities to reduce oxygen consumption in isolated rat hepatocytes. When rats were given each of these biguanides, the lactate concentration increased significantly. This effect was dose-dependent, and the EC50 values of metformin, buformin, and phenformin were 734, 119, and 4.97 μM, respectively. All of these biguanides reduced the oxygen consumption by isolated rat hepatocytes in a concentration-dependent manner. When the concentration required to reduce the oxygen consumption to 75% of the control value (from 0.40 to 0.29 μmol/min/mg protein) was compared with the EC50 value obtained in vivo, a clear correlation was observed among the three biguanides, suggesting that oxygen consumption in isolated rat hepatocytes can be used as an index of the incidence of lactic acidosis.

A nonclassical model based on the phenomenon of trapping at tissue binding sites with very long release times is presented, which implies that a volume of distribution and a steady-state level cannot be defined. In agreement with clinical PK data available in the literature, the model well describes not only single-dose disposition curves but also the persistently increasing plasma concentration-time curve during long-term treatment (up to 5 years) and the washout curve following cessation of therapy. The novel aspect is a long-tailed tissue residence time distribution which is incorporated into a recirculatory model leaving the initial distribution process and the clearance concept unchanged. The underlying theoretical approach, which is known as “strange or anomalous” kinetics in physical sciences, and the fractal scaling property of the model may enhance our understanding of the PK of extremely hydrophobic xenobiotics.},

An answer to this question is important because of the necessary extrapolation beyond the observation period (to infinity). Based on renewal theory, the present analysis shows that due to the recirculation process drug disposition curves become exponentially tailed also when the underlying organ transit time distributions have a power tail with exponent of −2 or smaller. Possible exceptions are drugs like amiodarone with anomalous distribution kinetics (deep tissue trapping) which are characterized by a power-law tail and an apparent lack of equilibrium distribution, corresponding to a fractional-in-time derivative formulation of kinetics.},

  abstract = {When a clearance curve in pharmacokinetic studies- and in tracer kinetics in general -- is well fitted by a sum of negative exponentials of time, in very many cases the data would also be well fitted over much or all of the same period by a function of time consisting mainly of a negative power or by a gamma function. There are also instances where two such power functions can be observed in the same clearance curve. Examples are given from numerous reanalyses of published results. These facts have not been explained, except as being fortuitous, by any existing theory or model based on two or more homogeneous compartments. Theoretical and practical implications are outlined and some general recipes are put forward with a view to replacing multicompartmental analysis.},

    "abstract": "Cells are fundamental building blocks of living organisms displaying an array of shapes, morphologies, and textures that encode specific functions and physical behaviors. Elucidating the rules of this code remains a challenge. In this work, we create biomimetic structural building blocks by coating ellipsoidal droplets of a smectic liquid crystal with a protein-based active cytoskeletal gel, thus obtaining core-shell structures. By exploiting the patterned texture and anisotropic shape of the smectic core, we were able to mold the complex nematodynamics of the interfacial active material and identify new time-dependent states where topological defects periodically oscillate between rotational and translational regimes. Our nemato-hydrodynamic simulations of active nematics demonstrate that, beyond topology and activity, the dynamics of the active material are profoundly influenced by the local curvature and smectic texture of the droplet, as well as by external hydrodynamic forces.\n  These results illustrate how the incorporation of these constraints into active nematic shells orchestrates remarkable spatio-temporal motifs, offering critical new insights into biological processes and providing compelling prospects for designing bio-inspired micro-machines.",

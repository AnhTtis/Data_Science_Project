    "abstract": "We revisit the exact thermodynamic description of the classical sine-Gordon field theory, a notorious integrable model. We found that existing results in the literature based on the soliton-gas picture did not correctly take into account light, but extended, solitons and thus led to incorrect results. This issue is regularized upon requantization: we derive the correct thermodynamics by taking the semiclassical limit of the quantum model. Our results are then extended to transport settings by means of Generalized Hydrodynamics.",

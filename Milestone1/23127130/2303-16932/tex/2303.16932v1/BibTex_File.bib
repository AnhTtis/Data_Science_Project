abstract = {The general properties of the factorized S-matrix in two-dimensional space-time are considered. The relation between the factorization property of the scattering theory and the infinite number of conservation laws of the underlying field theory is discussed. The factorization of the total S-matrix is shown to impose hard restrictions on two-particle matrix elements: they should satisfy special identities, the so-called factorization equations. The general solution of the unitarity, crossing and factorization equations is found for the S-matrices having isotopic O(N)-symmetry. The solution turns out to have different properties for the cases N = 2 and N ⩾ 3. For N = 2 the general solution depends on one parameter (of coupling constant type), whereas the solution for N ⩾ 3 has no parameters but depends analytically on N. The solution for N = 2 is shown to be an exact soliton S-matrix of the sine-Gordon model (equivalently the massive Thirring model). The total S-matrix of the model is constructed. In the case of N ⩾ 3 there are two “minimum” solutions, i.e., those having a minimum set of singularities. One of them is shown to be an exact S matrix of the quantum O(N)-symmetric nonlinear σ-model, the other is argued to describe the scattering of elementary particles of the Gross-Neveu model.}

abstract = {We study the generalized hydrodynamics of the one-dimensional classical non linear Schrӧdinger equation in the attractive phase. We thereby show that the thermodynamic limit is entirely captured by solitonic modes and radiation is absent. Our results are derived by considering the semiclassical limit of the quantum Bose gas, where the Planck constant has a key role as a regulator of the classical soliton gas. We use our result to study adiabatic interaction changes from the repulsive to the attractive phase, observing soliton production and obtaining exact analytical results which are in excellent agreement with Monte Carlo simulations.}

These classical field theories may be regarded as quantum field theories in the regime of high occupation numbers. This observation permits to recover the classical quantities from the quantum ones by taking a proper limit. In particular, the time averages of the classical theories can be expressed in terms of a suitable version of the LeClair–Mussardo formula relative to the generalized Gibbs ensemble. For the purposes of handling time averages, our approach provides a solution of the problem of the infinite gap solutions of the inverse scattering method.}

  abstract = {Analog quantum simulation has the potential to be an indispensable technique in the investigation of complex quantum systems. In this work, we numerically investigate a one-dimensional, faithful, analog, quantum electronic circuit simulator built out of Josephson junctions for one of the paradigmatic models of an integrable quantum field theory: the quantum sine-Gordon (qSG) model in 1+1 space-time dimensions. We analyze the lattice model using the density matrix renormalization group technique and benchmark our numerical results with existing Bethe ansatz computations. Furthermore, we perform analytical form-factor calculations for the two-point correlation function of vertex operators, which closely agree with our numerical computations. Finally, we compute the entanglement spectrum of the qSG model. We compare our results with those obtained using the integrable lattice-regularization based on the quantum XYZ chain and show that the quantum circuit model is less susceptible to corrections to scaling compared to the XYZ chain. We provide numerical evidence that the parameters required to realize the qSG model are accessible with modern-day superconducting circuit technology, thus providing additional credence towards the viability of the latter platform for simulating strongly interacting quantum field theories.},

The representation, originally introduced in Caux and Essler (2013 Phys. Rev. Lett. 110 257203), is founded on a mixture of exact data for overlaps together with variational reasonings. It is argued to be quite generally valid and thermodynamically exact for arbitrary times after the quench (from short times all the way up to the steady state), and applicable to a wide class of physically relevant observables. Here, we introduce the method and its language, give an overview of some recent results, suggest a roadmap and offer some perspectives on possible future research directions.}

abstract = {We establish the explicit correspondence between the theory of soliton gases in classical integrable dispersive hydrodynamics, and generalized hydrodynamics (GHD), the hydrodynamic theory for many-body quantum and classical integrable systems. This is done by constructing the GHD description of the soliton gas for the Korteweg–de Vries equation. We further predict the exact form of the free energy density and flux, and of the static correlation matrices of conserved charges and currents, for the soliton gas. For this purpose, we identify the solitons’ statistics with that of classical particles, and confirm the resulting GHD static correlation matrices by numerical simulations of the soliton gas. Finally, we express conjectured dynamical correlation functions for the soliton gas by simply borrowing the GHD results. In principle, other conjectures are also immediately available, such as diffusion and large-deviation functions for fluctuations of soliton transport.}

Integrable systems have infinitely many conserved quantities and stable quasiparticle excitations: when integrability is broken, only a few residual conserved quantities survive, eventually leading to thermalization, chaotic dynamics and conventional hydrodynamics. In this review, we summarize recent efforts to take into account small integrability breaking terms, and describe the transition from GHD to standard hydrodynamics. We discuss the current state of the art, with emphasis on weakly inhomogeneous potentials, generalized Boltzmann equations and collision integrals, as well as bound-state recombination effects. We also identify important open questions for future works.}

We compute the large deviation function, also called the full counting statistics, of energy transfer through the contact. These are universal and satisfy fluctuation relations. We provide a simple representation of these quantum fluctuations in terms of classical Poisson processes whose intensities are proportional to Boltzmann weights.}

For the focusing NLS equation the notions of soliton condensate and breather gas are introduced that are related to the phenomena of spontaneous modulational instability and the rogue wave formation. The integrability properties of the kinetic equation for soliton gas are discussed and some physically relevant solutions are presented and compared with direct numerical simulations of dispersive hydrodynamic systems.}

The latter characterizes the Lieb–Liniger gas after relaxation and is at the heart of GHD. We also present the asymptotic regimes of the Lieb–Liniger gas with their dedicated approximate descriptions. In the second section we enter the core of the subject and review the theoretical results of GHD in 1D Bose gases. The third and fourth sections are dedicated to experimental results obtained in cold atom experiments: the experimental realization of the Lieb–Liniger model is presented in section 3, with a selection of key results for systems at equilibrium, and section 4 presents the experimental tests of the GHD theory. In section 5 we review the effects of atom losses, which, assuming slow loss processes, can be described within the GHD framework. We conclude with a few open questions.}

abstract = {We derive a large-scale hydrodynamic equation, including diffusive and dissipative effects, for systems with generic static position-dependent driving forces coupling to local conserved quantities. We show that this equation predicts entropy increase and thermal states as the only stationary states. The equation applies to any hydrodynamic system with any number of local, parity and time-symmetric conserved quantities, in arbitrary dimension. It is fully expressed in terms of elements of an extended Onsager matrix. In integrable systems, this matrix admits an expansion in the density of excitations. We evaluate exactly its two-particle–hole contribution, which dominates at low density, in terms of the scattering phase and dispersion of the quasiparticles, giving a lower bound for the extended Onsager matrix and entropy production. We conclude with a molecular dynamics simulation, demonstrating thermalisation over diffusive time scales in the Toda interacting particle model with an inhomogeneous energy field.}

abstract = {This review summarizes recent advances in our understanding of anomalous transport in spin chains, viewed through the lens of integrability. Numerical advances, based on tensor-network methods, have shown that transport in many canonical integrable spin chains—most famously the Heisenberg model—is anomalous. Concurrently, the framework of generalized hydrodynamics has been extended to explain some of the mechanisms underlying anomalous transport. We present what is currently understood about these mechanisms, and discuss how they resemble (and differ from) the mechanisms for anomalous transport in other contexts. We also briefly review potential transport anomalies in systems where integrability is an emergent or approximate property. We survey instances of anomalous transport and dynamics that remain to be understood.}

abstract = {Single-crystal magnetic susceptibility and specific heat studies of the one-dimensional copper complex [PM·Cu(NO3)2·(H2O)2]n (PM = pyrimidine)  show that it behaves like a uniform S = 1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain, characterized by the exchange parameter J/kB = 36 K. Specific heat measurements in the applied magnetic field, however, reveal the formation of a field-induced spin excitation gap, whose magnitude depends on the magnitude and direction of the field. This behaviour is inconsistent with the ideal S = 1/2 Heisenberg chain. In the low-temperature region, a contribution to the susceptibility, approximately proportional to 1/T, is observed which varies strongly with the varying direction of the magnetic field. The field-induced gap and the 1/T contribution are largest for the same field direction. Previous observations of a field-induced gap in the related compounds copper benzoate and Yb4As3 have been explained by the alternating g tensor and alternating Dzyaloshinkii-Moriya interaction, producing an effective staggered magnetic field at the Cu and Yb ions. We apply this model to  [PM·Cu(NO3)2·(H2O)2]n and obtain a consistent quantitative explanation of the  low-temperature susceptibility, the field-induced gap and their dependence on the magnetic-field direction.}

abstract = {We study the dynamics of the sine-Gordon model after a quantum quench into the attractive regime, where the spectrum consists of solitons, antisolitons and breathers. In particular, we analyse the time-dependent expectation value of the vertex operator, , starting from an initial state in the ‘squeezed state form’ corresponding to integrable boundary conditions. Using an expansion in terms of exact form factors, we compute analytically the leading contributions to this expectation value at late times. We show that form factors containing breathers only contribute to the late-time dynamics if the initial state exhibits zero-momentum breather states. The leading terms at late times exponentially decay, and we compute the different decay rates. In addition, the late-time contributions from the zero-momentum breathers display oscillatory behaviour, with the oscillation frequency given by the breather mass renormalised by interaction effects. Using our result, we compute the low-energy contributions to the power spectrum of the vertex operator. The oscillatory terms in the expectation value are shown to produce smooth peaks in the power spectrum located near the values of the bare breather masses.}

abstract = {Reducing the dimensionality of a quantum system of interacting particles can simplify its physics. Such reduction is possible in ultracold atomic gases, where a lattice of one-dimensional (1D) gases can be generated using optical potentials. Malvania et al. studied the dynamics of 1D rubidium-87 atomic gases after a sudden increase in the axial trapping potential. Normally, these dynamics would be difficult to describe theoretically, but the researchers found that a theory called generalized hydrodynamics captured the behavior of their 1D system over a long time evolution. —JS Recent theory captures the dynamics of one-dimensional rubidium-87 atomic gases after a quench. The dynamics of strongly interacting many-body quantum systems are notoriously complex and difficult to simulate. A recently proposed theory called generalized hydrodynamics (GHD) promises to efficiently accomplish such simulations for nearly integrable systems. We test GHD with bundles of ultracold one-dimensional (1D) Bose gases by performing large trap quenches in both the strong and intermediate coupling regimes. We find that theory and experiment agree well over dozens of trap oscillations, for average dimensionless coupling strengths that range from 0.3 to 9.3. Our results show that GHD can accurately describe the quantum dynamics of a 1D nearly integrable experimental system even when particle numbers are low and density changes are large and fast.}}

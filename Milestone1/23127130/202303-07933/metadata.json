    "abstract": "We study the problem of intervention effects generating various types of\noutliers in an integer-valued autoregressive model with Poisson innovations. We\nconcentrate on outliers which enter the dynamics and can be seen as effects of\nextraordinary events. We consider three different scenarios, namely the\ndetection of an intervention effect of a known type at a known time, the\ndetection of an intervention effect of unknown type at a known time and the\ndetection of an intervention effect when both the type and the time are\nunknown. We develop F-tests and score tests for the first scenario. For the\nsecond and third scenarios we rely on the maximum of the different F-type or\nscore statistics. The usefulness of the proposed approach is illustrated using\nmonthly data on human brucellosis infections in Greece.",

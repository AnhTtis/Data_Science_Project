   \caption{Additional qualitative results on the real datasets. Ground truth (GT) poses are provided by COLMAP. SAMURAI* uses a fixed initialization of the poses at the North pole while SAMURAI uses a manual coarse initialization. With the $\sothree$ parameterization, the object-to-camera distances and the camera in-plane translations are assumed to be known.}

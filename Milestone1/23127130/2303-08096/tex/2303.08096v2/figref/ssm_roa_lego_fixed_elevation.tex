   We generate 100 views of the ``lego'' scene with from an elevation $\phi\simeq 7^\circ$ and an azimuth $\theta\in[0^\circ,360^\circ]$. The (normalized) self-similarity map $\degen_{f^*}$ shows that the views taken from opposite sides look similar, due to the presence of rotationally symmetric elements in the bulldozer. The regions of attraction $\conv_{f^*}(\theta^*)$ are colored in green. They only partially cover the latent space ($D(f^*)=0.55$, higher is better, see~\eqref{eq:difficulty}). With the equivalence relation $\relation=\relation_2$, the regions of attraction cover the quotient space $\latentspace/\relation$ almost entirely ($D_\relation(f^*)=0.87$, see~\eqref{eq:difficulty-rep}). Black dotted lines correspond to $\theta^*\in[\theta]$.

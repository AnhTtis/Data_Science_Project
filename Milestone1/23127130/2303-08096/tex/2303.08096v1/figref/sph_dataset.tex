   \caption{Sample views from the RGB-MELON datasets. The red--green texture is symmetric along the azimuthal direction. In order to make the pose estimation problem well-posed, the symmetry is broken by three red/green/blue squares. All the views are taken from the equator plane. The self-similarity maps and quotient self-similarity maps are plotted on the right for various replication orders $\reporder$.

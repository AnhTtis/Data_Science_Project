In Section~\ref{sec:Evaluation} we focused only on ten out of the twenty random
notebooks we picked (see Section~\ref{sub-sec:exp-setup}). Here, we include
results for all twenty notebooks.

\paragraph{\textbf{Per-Cell Speedups}} Figure~\ref{fig:ext:cell_level} shows the
cell-level speedups, corresponding to Figure~\ref{fig:cell_level}. The plots
look almost identical, and this is because \system{} does not decelerate
notebooks it does not rewrite. Thus, since this plot includes only slowdowns or
speedups that are outside the 0.1$\times$ range, there is hardly any discernible
difference. Similar observations are derived from
Figure~\ref{fig:ext:cells-slowdowns}, where the slowdowns are still under
interactive latency, i.e., 300ms.

These results further validate our hypothesis in
Section~\ref{sub-sec:vs-pandas}. That is, the slowdowns we observe are the
result of rewriting, independent of who performs it (in this case, \system{}).

When we include all twenty notebooks, the geometric mean speedup is 1.18$\times$
and the maximum slowdown is 1.56$\times$.

\paragraph{\textbf{Per-Notebook Speedups}} In Figure~\ref{fig:ext:nb_level} we
show the notebook-level speedups. This figure corresponds to
Figure~\ref{fig:nb_level}. As we mentioned, \system{} does not rewrite code in
the the ten new notebooks, so we do not see any additional speedup. However, it
remains that the slowdowns, when \system{} does not succeed, are minimal. The
geometric mean speedup is now 1.16$\times$ while the maximum slowdown is still
$1.03\times$.

\paragraph{\textbf{Comparison with Modin}} In
Figure~\ref{fig:ext:modin_nb_level} \footnote{which corresponds to
Figure~\ref{fig:modin_nb_level}.}, our conclusions are again unaltered.
\code{modin} slows down all the ten new notebooks and it rarely scales with the
number of cores. The geometric mean and maximum speedup remain the same.

In Figure~\ref{fig:ext:modin_nb_mem}\footnote{which corresponds to
Figure~\ref{fig:modin_nb_mem}.} we show the memory consumption when we consider
all twenty notebooks. The results are not significantly different for
\code{pandas} and \system{}. However, \code{modin}'s memory consumption becomes
even more aggressive. We see that for one notebook, \code{modin} consumes almost
250GB when \code{pandas} and \system{} consume less than 5GB.

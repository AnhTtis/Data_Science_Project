\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we identified program rewriting as a lightweight technique for
optimizing ad-hoc, single-machine EDA workloads. We implemented \system{}, the
first source-to-source, dynamic rewriter for Python, system which rewrites
\code{pandas} code automatically and transparently, while simultaneously
addressing the requirements and constraints of condition-checking.

We experimentally showed that \system{} was able to achieve significant speedups
(up to 57$\times$ for individual cells and 3.5$\times$ for whole notebooks),
both compared to \code{pandas} and \code{modin}, in \emph{real-world}, randomly
sampled notebooks. At the same time, \system{} incurs minimal runtime and memory
overheads whether it succeeds or not.

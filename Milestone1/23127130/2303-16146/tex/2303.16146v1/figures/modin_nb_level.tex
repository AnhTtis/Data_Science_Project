  \caption{Comparing \system{} with \code{modin} \cite{modin}. \system{} is
  faster for 9 out of 10 notebooks (Up to 26.4$\times$ faster with 4.1$\times$
  geometric mean). \code{modin} is, in many cases significantly, slower than the
  original for these 9 notebooks. For the one notebook where \system{} is
  slower, it is no more slower than 3\% compared to the original.}

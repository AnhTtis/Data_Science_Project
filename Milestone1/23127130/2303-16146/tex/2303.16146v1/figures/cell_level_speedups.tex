    \caption{Cell-level relative speedups (excluding cells that originally ran
    for less than 50ms and also all the cells that got a speedup or slowdown
    within the 10\% range). Again, \system{} provides significant speedups by up
    to 57$\times$. There are also slowdowns, which are not substantial (see
    Figure~\ref{fig:cells-slowdowns}).}

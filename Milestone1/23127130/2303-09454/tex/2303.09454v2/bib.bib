abstract = {This paper proposes an optimisation-based framework to tackle long-term centralised planning problems of multi-sector, integrated energy systems including electricity, hydrogen, natural gas, synthetic methane and carbon dioxide. The model selects and sizes the set of power generation, energy conversion and storage as well as carbon capture technologies minimising the cost of supplying energy demand in the form of electricity, hydrogen, natural gas or synthetic methane across the power, heating, transportation and industry sectors whilst accounting for policy drivers, such as energy independence, carbon dioxide emissions reduction targets, or support schemes. The usefulness of the model is illustrated by a case study evaluating the potential of sector coupling via power-to-gas and carbon capture technologies to achieve deep decarbonisation targets in the Belgian context. Results, on the one hand, indicate that power-to-gas can only play a minor supporting role in cross-sector decarbonisation strategies in Belgium, as electrolysis plants are deployed in moderate quantities whilst methanation plants do not appear in any studied scenario. On the other hand, given the limited renewable potential, post-combustion and direct air carbon capture technologies clearly play an enabling role in any decarbonisation strategy, but may also exacerbate the dependence on fossil fuels.}

ABSTRACT={Security of electricity supply has become a fundamental requirement for well-functioning modern societies. Because of its central position in all sections of society, the present paper considers the economic consequences of a power supply interruption. The value of lost load (VoLL) is a monetary indicator expressing the costs associated with an interruption of electricity supply. This paper reviews different methods for calculating VoLL, provides an overview of recently published studies, and presents suggestions to increase the explanatory power and international comparability of VoLL.}

	ABSTRACT = {Sector coupling has recently gained increased attention, bringing new complexity into infrastructure investment decisions but also new opportunities for its smart operation. In a multi-energy system the benefits of an investment in one system may spread over other connected sectors, calling for new metrics when evaluating the cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and for widening scenarios of investment decisions to alternative solutions in the cross-energy system which can be more economical.
		
		Sector coupling brings new challenges such as: amount and shape of electric demand growth with electrification of heating and transport; how much distribution-grid based system reinforcement is needed to accommodate the charging of Electric Vehicles (EV) or electricity needs of Heat Pumps (HP), and when in the coming decades or years these devices  should be installed; whether the costs of electrolysers for power-to-gas decreases significantly , and how that affects the economics of electricity vs. gas transmission and distribution.
		
		There are great expectations about the role of sector coupling in the achievement of a swift, economical efficient green transition with a high security of supply, but it is unclear to which extent current technologies can provide on this agenda.
		
		This ETIP SNET White Paper aims to elaborate on those questions, starting with clarification of concepts and assessment of potential impacts.},

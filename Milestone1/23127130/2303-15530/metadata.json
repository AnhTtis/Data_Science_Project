    "abstract": "In the event of large disturbances, the practice of controlled islanding is used as a last resort to prevent cascading outages. The application of the strategy at the right time is crucial to maintaining system security. A controlled islanding strategy may be deployed efficiently at the right time by predicting the time of uncontrolled system splitting. The purpose of this study is to predict the appropriate islanding time to prevent catastrophic blackout and uncontrolled islanding based on existing relationships between coherent generator groups. A new instability index is derived from the proximity of inter-area oscillations to power splitting indices. Power splitting indices are derived using synchronization coefficients, which recognize the conditions in the system that warrant controlled islanding. The critical values of indices are calculated in offline mode using simulation data from IEEE 39-Buses, and their online performance is evaluated following a controlled islanding strategy. Through the introduction of these indices, system degradation can be effectively evaluated, and blackouts can be predicted early and prevented by controlled islanding at the right time.",

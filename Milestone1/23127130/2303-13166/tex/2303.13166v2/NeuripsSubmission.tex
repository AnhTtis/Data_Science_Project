\newcommand{\protorelated}{Prototype based models like \gls{ProtoTree}, \gls{ProtoPNet}, \gls{ProtoPShare} and \gls{ProtoPool} combine a deep feature extractor with a more interpretable model by using the similarities to learned prototypes as input to the linear model or decision tree.
While they achieve competitive performance on fine-grained image classification, \citet{kim2021hive} and \citet{hoffmann2021looks} indicate a gap between the perceived similarities of humans and prototype based models.}

  \item Did you describe the limitations of your work?
    \answerYes{See Section ~\ref{sec:limits}}
  \item Did you discuss any potential negative societal impacts of your work?
    \answerYes{See section~\ref{sec:limits}}
  \item Have you read the ethics review guidelines and ensured that your paper conforms to them?
    \answerYes{}
\end{enumerate}


\item If you are including theoretical results...
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Did you state the full set of assumptions of all theoretical results?
    \answerNA{}
        \item Did you include complete proofs of all theoretical results?
     \answerNA{}
\end{enumerate}


\item If you ran experiments...
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Did you include the code, data, and instructions needed to reproduce the main experimental results (either in the supplemental material or as a URL)?
    \answerNo{The data is missing as it is freely available. The code is not included but the method and instructions are quite detailed.}

    \answerYes{See standard deviations in Appendix}
        \item Did you include the total amount of compute and the type of resources used (e.g., type of GPUs, internal cluster, or cloud provider)?
    \answerNo{Total figure is not available}
\end{enumerate}

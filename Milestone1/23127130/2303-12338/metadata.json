    "abstract": "Many quantum sensing suggestions rely on temporal correlations found in photon pairs generated by parametric down-conversion. In this work, we show that the temporal correlations in light with a thermal photon statistics can be equally useful for such applications. Using a sub-threshold laser diode as an ultrabright source of thermal light, we demonstrate optical range finding to a distance of up to 1.8 km.",

    "abstract": "Quasi-real photons exchanged in relativistic heavy ion interactions are powerful probes of the gluonic structure of nuclei. The first measurement of the coherent J/$ψ$ photoproduction cross section in ultraperipheral lead-lead collisions is presented over a wide range of photon-nucleus center-of-mass energies per nucleon (W$^\\text{Pb}_{γ\\text{N}}$). Results are obtained using data at the nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV collected by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.52 nb$^{-1}$. The cross section is observed to rise rapidly at low W$^\\text{Pb}_{γ\\text{N}}$, and plateau above W$^\\text{Pb}_{γ\\text{N}}$ $\\approx$ 40 GeV, up to 400 GeV, a new regime of small Bjorken-$x$ ($\\approx$ 6 $\\times$ 10$^{-5}$) gluons being probed in a heavy nucleus. The observed energy dependence is not predicted by current quantum chromodynamic models.",

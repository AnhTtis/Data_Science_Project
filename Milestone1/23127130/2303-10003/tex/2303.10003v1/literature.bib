Final states are not resolved, however, the data represent transitions between low-lying states. The data are used to extract transfer probabilities and form factors for neutron transfer between low-lying states. A DWBA analysis gives a quantitative description of the observed overall cross section for one-neutron transfer. The enhancement of the two neutron transfer is discussed using semiclassical arguments; in this context additional data for the systems86Kr+208Pb,58Ni+208Pb,136Xe+238U and208Pb+238U are discussed. The general features of quasielastic transfer probabilities defined in a macroscopic way by an energy resolution of ca. 5--10 MeV, which is so far the only experimental possibility, are shown to give meaningful information on single nucleon and pair transfer between heavy nuclei. The latter point is also supported by coupled channel calculations for the transfer flux in these reactions and it is shown that a strong coupling situation is only reached at distances, where very strong absorption due to deeply inelastic reactions has set in.",

	abstract={The latest developments made in deriving accurate mass predictions within the microscopic Skyrme Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov (HFB) approach are described. Using the HFB method, we have refitted our BSk20 and BSk21 models, on which were based the HFB-20 and HFB-21 mass tables, to the 2353 measured masses of nuclei with N and Z ? 8 given in the newly available 2012 Atomic Mass Evaluation. In addition, we have now investigated the sensitivity to the symmetry coefficient J and the stiffness of the neutron matter equation of state. We present here in all 5 new Skyrme interactions, along with their corresponding mass tables. The root-mean square deviation obtained with our preferred model (HFB-24) with respect to essentially all the 2353 available mass data falls to 0.549 MeV, the best value ever found within the mean-field framework. Since our Skyrme force is also constrained by the properties of pure neutron matter this new model is particularly well-suited for application to astrophysical problems involving a neutron-rich environment, such as the elucidation of the r-process of nucleosynthesis, and the description of supernova cores and neutron-star crusts.}

Grain boundaries are widely envisaged to be mechanically static structures, but this report outlines an experimental investigation of stress-driven grain boundary migration manifested as grain growth in nanocrystalline aluminum thin films. Specimens fabricated with specially designed stress and strain concentrators are used to uncover the relative importance of these parameters on grain growth. In contrast to traditional descriptions of grain boundaries as stationary obstacles to dislocation-based plasticity, the results of this study indicate that shear stresses drive grain boundaries to move in a manner consistent with recent molecular dynamics simulations and theoretical predictions of coupled grain boundary migration.},

	abstract={We investigate the properties of relativistic r -modes of slowly rotating neutron stars by using a relativistic version of the Cowling approximation. In our formalism, we take into account the influence of the Coriolis-like force on the stellar oscillations but ignore the effects of the centrifugal-like force. For three neutron star models, we calculate the fundamental r -modes with l ' = m = 2 and 3. We find that the oscillation frequency ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/567/2/1112/img1.gif] {img1.gif} of the fundamental r -mode is given in a good approximation by ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/567/2/1112/img1.gif] {img1.gif} ? ? 0 ?, where ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/567/2/1112/img1.gif] {img1.gif} is defined in the corotating frame at spatial infinity and ? is the angular frequency of rotation of the star. The proportional coefficient ? 0 is only weakly dependent on ?, but it strongly depends on the relativistic parameter GM / c 2 R , where M and R are the mass and the radius of the star. All the fundamental r -modes with l ' = m computed in this study are discrete modes with distinct regular eigenfunctions, and they all fall in the continuous part of the frequency spectrum associated with Kojima's equation. These relativistic r -modes are obtained by including the effects of rotation higher than the first order of ? so that the buoyant force plays a role, the situation of which is quite similar to that for Newtonian r -modes.}

We show that the main differential equation, which is formally singular at lowest order in the slow-rotation expansion, can be regularized if one considers the initial value problem rather than the normal mode problem. However, a more physically motivated way to regularize the problem is to include higher order terms. This allows us to develop a practical approach for solving the problem and we provide results that support earlier conclusions obtained for uniform density stars. In particular, we show that there will exist a single r-mode for each permissible combination of l and m . We discuss these results and provide some caveats regarding their usefulness for estimates of gravitational-radiation reaction timescales. The close connection between the seemingly singular relativistic r-mode problem and issues arising because of the presence of corotation points in differentially rotating stars is also clarified.}

	abstract="We present a brief, observational review about the study of the cooling behaviour of accretion-heated neutron stars and the inferences about the neutron-star crust and core that have been obtained from these studies. Accretion of matter during outbursts can heat the crust out of thermal equilibrium with the core and after the accretion episodes are over, the crust will cool down until crust-core equilibrium is restored. We discuss the observed properties of the crust cooling sources and what has been learned about the physics of neutron-star crusts. We also briefly discuss those systems that have been observed long after their outbursts were over, i.e, during times when the crust and core are expected to be in thermal equilibrium. The surface temperature is then a direct probe for the core temperature. By comparing the expected temperatures based on estimates of the accretion history of the targets with the observed ones, the physics of neutron-star cores can be investigated. Finally, we discuss similar studies performed for strongly magnetized neutron stars in which the magnetic field might play an important role in the heating and cooling of the neutron stars.",

  abstract={Pulsars are remarkable objects that emit across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, providing a powerful probe of the interstellar medium. In this study, we investigate the relation between dispersion measure (DM) and X-ray absorption column density N H using 68 radio pulsars detected at X-ray energies with the Chandra X-Ray Observatory or XMM-Newton . We find a best-fit empirical linear relation of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/768/1/64/apj467544ieqn1.gif] {$N_\mathrm{H}\rm \;(10^{20}\,cm^{-2})= 0.30^{+0.13}_{-0.09}\;DM\; (pc\,cm^{-3})$} , which corresponds to an average ionization of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/768/1/64/apj467544ieqn2.gif] {$10^{+4}_{-3}$} %, confirming the ratio of one free electron per 10 neutral hydrogen atoms commonly assumed in the literature. We also compare different N H estimates and note that some N H values obtained from X-ray observations are higher than the total Galactic H I column density along the same line of sight, while the optical extinction generally gives the best N H predictions.}

The model contains six macroscopic monopole terms leading asymptotically to a Liquid Drop form, three microscopic terms supposed to mock configuration mixing (multipole) corrections to the monopole shell effects, and one term in charge of detecting deformed nuclei and calculating their masses. A careful analysis of the model suggests a program of future developments that includes a complementary approach to masses based on an independently determined monopole Hamiltonian, a better description of deformations and specific suggestions for the treatment of three body forces."

	abstract={The type I X-ray-bursting low-mass X-ray binary KS 1731-260 was recently detected for the first time in quiescence by Wijnands et al. following a ? ob ? 13 yr outburst, which ended in 2001 February. We show that the emission area radius for a H atmosphere spectrum (possibly with a hard power-law component that dominates the emission above 3.5 keV) is consistent with that observed from other quiescent neutron star transients, R ? = 23 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/580/1/413/img1.gif] {img1.gif} ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/580/1/413/img2.gif] {img2.gif} km and examine possible IR counterparts for KS 1731-260. Unlike all other known transient neutron stars, the duration of this recent (and the only observed) outburst is as long as the thermal diffusion time of the crust. The large amount of heat deposited by reactions in the crust will have heated the crust to temperatures much higher than the equilibrium core temperature. As a result, the thermal luminosity currently observed from the neutron star is dominated not by the core but by the crust. This scenario implies that the mean outburst recurrence timescale found by Wijnands et al. (~200 yr) is a lower limit. Moreover, because the thermal emission is dominated by the hot crust, the level and the time evolution of quiescent luminosity is determined mostly by the amount of heat deposited in the crust during the most recent outburst (for which reasonable constraints on the mass accretion rate exist) and is only weakly sensitive to the core temperature. Using estimates of the outburst mass accretion rate, our calculations of the quiescent flux immediately following the end of the outburst agree with the observed quiescent flux to within a factor of a few. In this paper, we present simulations of the evolution of the quiescent light curve for different scenarios of the crust microphysics and demonstrate that monitoring observations (with currently flying instruments) spanning from 1 to 30 yr can measure the crust cooling timescale and the total amount of heat stored in the crust. These quantities have not been directly measured for any neutron star. This makes KS 1731-260 a unique laboratory for studying the thermal properties of the crust by monitoring the luminosity over the next few years to decades.}

After publication we found a small bug in the photometry package that was giving odd extrapolations of the edges of the UV imaging transmission curves, giving rise to artificial photometry (or lack of) in some filters. This changes the values for the flux ratios of all plots in appendix fig. A1 of the published manuscript. We provide the corrected plots in this erratum. Although the ratio values are different, the conclusions remain unchanged.We also note that the original manuscript refers to the template spectra shown in fig. A1 as ‘blackbody spectra’, while this should have read ‘stellar atmosphere spectra with the appropriate effective temperature’. These spectra are from Allard, Homeier \\&amp; Freytag (2012).1 This error was a typesetting mistake and does not affect any results or conclusions presented in the original paper.}",

    "abstract": "Chirality plays an important role in understanding the dynamics of quantum field theories. In this paper, we study the dynamics of models where renormalization group flows change the chiral structure of the theory. We introduce model building tools and construct models with a variety of chirality flows: from the appearance of new massless composite matter, to the development of mass gaps to completely general changes in the chiral matter content. The stability of chirally symmetric vacua is sensitive to the interplay between non-perturbative dynamics and deformations necessary to generate chirality flows. In particular, we show that chirality flows can be easily induced by deformations of s-confining models. On the other hand, in the absence of true s-confinement, the required deformations destabilize chirally symmetric ground states.",

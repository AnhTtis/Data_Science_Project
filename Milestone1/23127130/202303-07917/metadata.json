    "abstract": "The literature on reachability analysis methods for neural networks currently\nonly focuses on uncertainties on the network's inputs. In this paper, we\nintroduce two new approaches for the reachability analysis of neural networks\nwith additional uncertainties on their internal parameters (weight matrices and\nbias vectors of each layer), which may open the field of formal methods on\nneural networks to new topics, such as safe training or network repair. The\nfirst and main method that we propose relies on existing reachability analysis\napproach based on mixed monotonicity (initially introduced for dynamical\nsystems). The second proposed approach extends the ESIP (Error-based Symbolic\nInterval Propagation) approach which was first implemented in the verification\ntool Neurify, and first mentioned in the publication of the tool VeriNet.\nAlthough the ESIP approach has been shown to often outperform the\nmixed-monotonicity reachability analysis in the classical case with\nuncertainties only on the network's inputs, we show in this paper through\nnumerical simulations that the situation is greatly reversed (in terms of\nprecision, computation time, memory usage, and broader applicability) when\ndealing with uncertainties on the weights and biases.",

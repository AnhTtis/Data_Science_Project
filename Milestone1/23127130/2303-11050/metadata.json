    "abstract": "The article is devoted to the study of mappings that distort the modulus of families of paths by the Poletsky inequality type. At boundary points of a domain, we have obtained the Hölder inequality for such mappings, provided that their characteristic has finite integral averages over infinitesimal balls. In the manuscript, we have separately considered the cases of homeomorphisms and mappings with branching. Also, we have separately considered good boundaries and domains with prime ends.",

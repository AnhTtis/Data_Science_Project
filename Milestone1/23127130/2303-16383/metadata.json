    "abstract": "The study of blazar jet has been performed for several decades via the VLBI technique, while its generation and propagation stay unclear. In the present work, we compiled a sample of 407 VLBI detected \\textit{Fermi} blazars (VFBs) and studied the correlations between apparent velocity (${\\rm log}\\,β_{\\rm app}$) and jet/accretion disk properties. We found a positive correlation between $γ$-ray luminosity (${\\rm log}\\,L_{\\rm γ}$) and ${\\rm log}\\,β_{\\rm app}$, the correlation suggests that the apparent motion of jet knot is related to the jet power.",

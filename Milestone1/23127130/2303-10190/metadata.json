    "abstract": "The arrangement of dwarf galaxies in a thin plane surrounding the Milky Way has been thought to contradict the prevailing cosmological model of cold dark matter in the Universe. New work suggests that this arrangement may just be a temporary alignment, bringing our galaxy back into agreement with theoretical expectations once the radial distribution of satellites is taken into account.",

    abstract = "{Quantum computers, although not yet available on the market, will revolutionise the future of information processing. Already now, quantum computers of special purpose, i.e., quantum simulators, are within reach. The physics of ultracold atoms, ions, and molecules offers unprecedented possibilities of control of quantum many systems, and novel possibilities of applications for quantum information and quantum metrology. Particularly fascinating is the possibility of using ultracold atoms in lattices to simulate condensed matter or even high energy physics. This book provides a comprehensive overview of ultracold lattice gases as quantum simulators, an interdisciplinary field involving atomic, molecular, and optical physics; quantum optics; quantum information; and condensed matter and high energy physics. It includes some introductory chapters on basic concepts and methods, and focuses on the physics of spinor, dipolar, disordered, and frustrated lattice gases, before reviewing in detail artificial lattice gauge fields with ultracold gases. The last part of the book moves onto a discussion of possible implementations universal quantum computers with ultracold atoms. After a crash course in quantum information theory, several models of quantum computation with ultracold gases are presented, as well as the current understanding of condensed matter from a quantum information perspective. The book ends with the general discussion of various detection methods that are unique for ultracold atoms.}",

abstract = {We report some nonsmooth dynamics of a Bloch state in a one-dimensional tight binding model with the periodic boundary condition. After a sudden change of the potential of an arbitrary site, quantities like the survival probability of the particle in the initial Bloch state show cusps periodically, with the period being the Heisenberg time associated with the energy spectrum. This phenomenon is a nonperturbative counterpart of the nonsmooth dynamics observed previously (Zhang J. M. and Haque M., arXiv:1404.4280) in a periodically driven tight binding model. Underlying the cusps is an exactly solvable model, which consists of equally spaced levels extending from  to , between which two arbitrary levels are coupled to each other by the same strength.}

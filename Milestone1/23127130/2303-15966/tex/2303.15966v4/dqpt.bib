    abstract = "{Quantum computers, although not yet available on the market, will revolutionise the future of information processing. Already now, quantum computers of special purpose, i.e., quantum simulators, are within reach. The physics of ultracold atoms, ions, and molecules offers unprecedented possibilities of control of quantum many systems, and novel possibilities of applications for quantum information and quantum metrology. Particularly fascinating is the possibility of using ultracold atoms in lattices to simulate condensed matter or even high energy physics. This book provides a comprehensive overview of ultracold lattice gases as quantum simulators, an interdisciplinary field involving atomic, molecular, and optical physics; quantum optics; quantum information; and condensed matter and high energy physics. It includes some introductory chapters on basic concepts and methods, and focuses on the physics of spinor, dipolar, disordered, and frustrated lattice gases, before reviewing in detail artificial lattice gauge fields with ultracold gases. The last part of the book moves onto a discussion of possible implementations universal quantum computers with ultracold atoms. After a crash course in quantum information theory, several models of quantum computation with ultracold gases are presented, as well as the current understanding of condensed matter from a quantum information perspective. The book ends with the general discussion of various detection methods that are unique for ultracold atoms.}",

abstract = {We report some nonsmooth dynamics of a Bloch state in a one-dimensional tight binding model with the periodic boundary condition. After a sudden change of the potential of an arbitrary site, quantities like the survival probability of the particle in the initial Bloch state show cusps periodically, with the period being the Heisenberg time associated with the energy spectrum. This phenomenon is a nonperturbative counterpart of the nonsmooth dynamics observed previously (Zhang J. M. and Haque M., arXiv:1404.4280) in a periodically driven tight binding model. Underlying the cusps is an exactly solvable model, which consists of equally spaced levels extending from  to , between which two arbitrary levels are coupled to each other by the same strength.}

journal = {Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical},
abstract = {We explore the dynamics of long-range Kitaev chain by varying pairing interaction exponent. It is well known that the distinctive features of the nonequilibrium dynamics of a closed quantum system are closely related to the equilibrium phase transitions. Specifically, the return probability (Loschmidt echo) of the system to its initial state, in the finite-size system, is expected to exhibit periodicity after a sudden quench to a quantum critical point. The time of the first revivals scales inversely with the maximum of the group velocity. We show that, contrary to expectations, the periodicity of the return probability breaks for a sudden quench to the non-trivial quantum critical point. Further, we find that the periodicity of the return probability scales inversely with the group velocity at the gap closing point for a quench to the trivial critical point of truly long-range pairing case. Also, analyzing the effect of averaging quenched disorder shows that the revivals in the short-range pairing cases are more robust against disorder than that of the long-range pairing case. We also study the effect of disorder on the non-analyticities of the rate function of the return probability which introduced as a witness of the dynamical phase transition. We show that the non-analyticities in the rate function of return probability are washed out in the presence of strong disorders.}

journal = {New Journal of Physics},
abstract = {We study the time evolution of thermodynamic observables that characterise the dissipative nature of thermal relaxation after an instantaneous temperature quench. Combining tools from stochastic thermodynamics and large-deviation theory, we develop a powerful theory for computing the large-deviation statistics of such observables. Our method naturally leads to a description in terms of a dynamical Landau theory, a versatile tool for the analysis of finite-time dynamical phase transitions. The topology of the associated Landau potential allows for an unambiguous identification of the dynamical order parameter and of the phase diagram. As an immediate application of our method, we show that the probability distribution of the heat exchanged between a mean-field spin model and the environment exhibits a singular point, a kink, caused by a finite-time dynamical phase transition. Using our Landau theory, we conduct a detailed study of the phase transition. Although the manifestation of the new transition is similar to that of a previously found finite-time transition in the magnetisation, the properties and the dynamical origins of the two turn out to be very different.}

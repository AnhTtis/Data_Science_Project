    "abstract": "We study the dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) in the multi-band Bloch Hamiltonian of the one-dimensional periodic Kitaev model following a quench from a Bloch band. Using a combination of dynamical free energy and Pancharatnam geometric phase analysis, we demonstrate that the critical times of DQPTs are not periodically spaced due to the deviation of critical momentum caused by the multi-band effect, which differs from the results found in two-band models. We propose a geometric interpretation to explain the non-uniformly spaced critical times. Additionally, we clarify the conditions necessary for the occurrence of the DQPT in the multi-band Bloch Hamiltonian. We find that only the quench from the Bloch states, which causes the band gap to collapse at the critical point, can induce a DQPT after crossing the quantum phase transition. Otherwise, the DQPT will not occur. Furthermore, we confirm that the dynamical topological order parameter, which is defined by the winding number of the Pancharatnam geometric phase, is not quantized due to the periodic modulation but still displays discontinuous jumps at the critical times of DQPTs. In addition, we extend our theory to mixed-state DQPT and find that the DQPT is absent at non-zero temperatures.",

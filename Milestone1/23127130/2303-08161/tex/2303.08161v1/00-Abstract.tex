\begin{abstract}
Sangiorgi's normal form bisimilarity is call-by-name, identifies all the call-by-name meaningless terms, and rests on open terms in its definition. The literature contains a normal form bisimilarity for the call-by-value $\lambda$-calculus, Lassen's \emph{enf bisimilarity}, which validates all of Moggi's monadic laws. The starting point of this work is the observation that enf bisimilarity is not the call-by-value equivalent of Sangiorgi's, because it does not identify the call-by-value meaningless terms. The issue has to do with open terms. We then develop a new call-by-value normal form bisimilarity, deemed \emph{net bisimilarity}, by exploiting an existing formalism for dealing with open terms in call-by-value. It turns out that enf and net bisimilarities are \emph{incomparable}, as net bisimilarity identifies meaningless terms but it does not validate Moggi's laws. Moreover, there is no easy way to merge them. To better understand the situation, we provide a detailed analysis of the rich range of possible call-by-value normal form bisimilarities, relating them to Ehrhard's call-by-value relational semantics.

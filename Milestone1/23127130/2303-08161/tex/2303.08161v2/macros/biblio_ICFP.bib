abstract = {This paper describes two new bisimulation equivalences for the pure untyped call-by-value ?-calculus, called enf bisimilarity and enf bisimilarity up to ?. They are based on eager reduction of terms to eager normal form (enf), analogously to co-inductive bisimulation characterizations of L\'{e}vy-Longo tree equivalence and B\"{o}hm tree equivalence (up to ?). We argue that enf bisimilarity is the call-by-value analogue of L\'{e}vy-Longo tree equivalence. Enf bisimilarity (up to ?) is the congruence on source terms induced by the call-by-value CPS transform and B\"{o}hm tree equivalence (up to ?) on target terms. Enf bisimilarity and enf bisimilarity up to ? enjoy powerful bisimulation proof principles which, among other things, can be used to establish a retraction theorem for the call-by-value CPS transform.},

abstract = {This paper examines the old question of the relationship between ISWIM and the λ-calculus, using the distinction between call-by-value and call-by-name. It is held that the relationship should be mediated by a standardisation theorem. Since this leads to difficulties, a new λ-calculus is introduced whose standardisation theorem gives a good correspondence with ISWIM as given by the SECD machine, but without the letrec feature. Next a call-by-name variant of ISWIM is introduced which is in an analogous correspondence withthe usual λ-calculus. The relation between call-by-value and call-by-name is then studied by giving simulations of each language by the other and interpretations of each calculus in the other. These are obtained as another application of the continuation technique. Some emphasis is placed throughout on the notion of operational equality (or contextual equality). If terms can be proved equal in a calculus they are operationally equal in the corresponding language. Unfortunately, operational equality is not preserved by either of the simulations.}

abstract = {The use of λ-calculus in richer settings, possibly involving parallelism, is examined in terms of the effect on the equivalence between λ-terms. We concentrate on Abramsky′s lazy λ-calculus and we follow two directions. Firstly, the λ-calculus is studied within a process calculus by examining the equivalence [formula] induced by Milner′s encoding into the π-calculus. We start from a characterization of [formula] presented in (Sangiorgi D., 1992) Ph.D. thesis. We derive a few simpler operational characterisations, from which we prove full abstraction w.r.t. Levy-Longo Trees. Secondly, we examine Abramsky′s applicative bisimulation when the λ-calculus is augmented with (well-formed) operators, that is symbols equipped with reduction rules describing their behaviour. In this way, the maximal discrimination between pure λ-terms (i.e., the finest behavioural equivalence) is obtained when all operators are used. We prove that the presence of certain non-deterministic operators is sufficient and necessary to induce it and that it coincides with the discrimination given by [formula]. We conclude that the introduction of non-determinism into the λ-calculus is exactly what makes applicative bisimulation appropriate for reasoning about the functional terms when concurrent features are also present in the language, or when they are embedded into a concurrent language.}

abstract = {Church's λ-calculus is an enthralling object of mathematical and logical study, born in 1930 as the mathematical theory of functions as rules, and invented for foundational purposes. λ-calculus gave rise to the first (and the most elegant) mathematical definition of computable functions and inspired the main theorems of recursion theory. It came back on the scene in the 1960s with the development of programming theory. A capital contribution of λ-calculus to this subject is that it allows the mathematical expression and development of the Curry–Howard correspondence between proofs and programs, which generates deep and active research. The first aim of this paper is to introduce λ-calculus to a mathematical audience with no previous knowledge of it. After giving a brief insight to the conceptual and practical importance of typed calculi we will concentrate on untyped λ-calculus, which is logic free, has the most powerful expressive power and can be more easily described. In the second and main part of the paper we give an elementary, algebraic, and bottom-up presentation of its useful classes of models, which are powersets built from adequate “webs”. We focus on two methods: completion of partial webs (for building models) and reducibility (for studying them). In the third part we try to give evidence that the study of models is interesting per se. We survey or raise a lot of natural questions which arise when one tries to develop a model theory for untyped λ-calculus, in the sense of a general study of the relations between its models and its equational extensions, and we illustrate them with many recent results. Finally, we give a sketchy presentation of Grue's map theory, which is a common foundation for Mathematics, Logic and Computer Science, based on λ-calculus and, hence, on the notion of function and application (instead of sets and membership). MT fulfills Church's original aim and its consistency can be proved by exhibiting webbed models for it.}

abstract = {Normal-form bisimilarity is a simple, easy-to-use behavioral equivalence that relates terms in λ-calculi by decomposing their normal forms into bisimilar subterms. Besides, they allow for powerful up-to techniques, such as bisimulation up to context, which simplify bisimulation proofs even further. However, proving soundness of these relations becomes complicated in the presence of η-expansion and usually relies on ad-hoc proof methods which depend on the language. In this paper, we propose a more systematic proof method to show that an extensional normal-form bisimilarity along with its corresponding bisimulation up to context are sound. We illustrate our technique with the call-by-value λ-calculus, before applying it to a call-by-value λ-calculus with the delimited-control operators shift and reset. In both cases, there was previously no sound bisimulation up to context validating the η-law. Our results have been formalized in the Coq proof assistant.}

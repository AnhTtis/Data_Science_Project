abstract = {This paper describes two new bisimulation equivalences for the pure untyped call-by-value ?-calculus, called enf bisimilarity and enf bisimilarity up to ?. They are based on eager reduction of terms to eager normal form (enf), analogously to co-inductive bisimulation characterizations of L\'{e}vy-Longo tree equivalence and B\"{o}hm tree equivalence (up to ?). We argue that enf bisimilarity is the call-by-value analogue of L\'{e}vy-Longo tree equivalence. Enf bisimilarity (up to ?) is the congruence on source terms induced by the call-by-value CPS transform and B\"{o}hm tree equivalence (up to ?) on target terms. Enf bisimilarity and enf bisimilarity up to ? enjoy powerful bisimulation proof principles which, among other things, can be used to establish a retraction theorem for the call-by-value CPS transform.},

abstract = {This paper examines the old question of the relationship between ISWIM and the λ-calculus, using the distinction between call-by-value and call-by-name. It is held that the relationship should be mediated by a standardisation theorem. Since this leads to difficulties, a new λ-calculus is introduced whose standardisation theorem gives a good correspondence with ISWIM as given by the SECD machine, but without the letrec feature. Next a call-by-name variant of ISWIM is introduced which is in an analogous correspondence withthe usual λ-calculus. The relation between call-by-value and call-by-name is then studied by giving simulations of each language by the other and interpretations of each calculus in the other. These are obtained as another application of the continuation technique. Some emphasis is placed throughout on the notion of operational equality (or contextual equality). If terms can be proved equal in a calculus they are operationally equal in the corresponding language. Unfortunately, operational equality is not preserved by either of the simulations.}

Preserving confluence, we extend Plotkin's original reduction without adding extra syntactical constructors, and we get a call-by-value operational characterization of solvable terms. Moreover, we give a semantical characterization of solvable terms in a relational model, based on Linear Logic, satisfying the Taylor expansion formula. As a technical tool, we also use a resource-sensitive calculus (with tests) in which the elements of the model are definable.",

abstract = {The use of λ-calculus in richer settings, possibly involving parallelism, is examined in terms of the effect on the equivalence between λ-terms. We concentrate on Abramsky′s lazy λ-calculus and we follow two directions. Firstly, the λ-calculus is studied within a process calculus by examining the equivalence [formula] induced by Milner′s encoding into the π-calculus. We start from a characterization of [formula] presented in (Sangiorgi D., 1992) Ph.D. thesis. We derive a few simpler operational characterisations, from which we prove full abstraction w.r.t. Levy-Longo Trees. Secondly, we examine Abramsky′s applicative bisimulation when the λ-calculus is augmented with (well-formed) operators, that is symbols equipped with reduction rules describing their behaviour. In this way, the maximal discrimination between pure λ-terms (i.e., the finest behavioural equivalence) is obtained when all operators are used. We prove that the presence of certain non-deterministic operators is sufficient and necessary to induce it and that it coincides with the discrimination given by [formula]. We conclude that the introduction of non-determinism into the λ-calculus is exactly what makes applicative bisimulation appropriate for reasoning about the functional terms when concurrent features are also present in the language, or when they are embedded into a concurrent language.}

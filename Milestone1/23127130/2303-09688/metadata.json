    "abstract": "Introduced by Mallows in statistical ranking theory, Mallows permutation model is a class of non-uniform probability measures on the symmetric group $S_n$ that depend on a distance metric $d(σ,τ)$ on $S_n$ and a scale parameter $β$. Taking the distance metric to be the $L^1$ and $L^2$ distances--which are respectively known as Spearman's footrule and Spearman's rank correlation in the statistics literature--leads to Mallows permutation models with $L^1$ and $L^2$ distances.\n  In this paper, we study the length of the longest increasing subsequence of random permutations drawn from Mallows permutation models with $L^1$ and $L^2$ distances. For both models and various regimes of the scale parameter $β$, we determine the typical order of magnitude of the length of the longest increasing subsequence and establish a law of large numbers for this length. For Mallows permutation model with the $L^1$ distance, when $β\\sim θn^{-1}$ for some fixed $θ>0$, the typical length of the longest increasing subsequence is of order $\\sqrt{n}$; when $n^{-1}\\ll β\\ll 1$, this typical length is of order $n\\sqrtβ$. For Mallows permutation model with the $L^2$ distance, when $β\\sim θn^{-2}$ for some fixed $θ>0$, the typical length of the longest increasing subsequence is of order $\\sqrt{n}$; when $n^{-2}\\ll β\\ll 1$, this typical length is of order $nβ^{\\frac{1}{4}}$.",

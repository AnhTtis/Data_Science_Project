    "abstract": "Using first-principles calculations, we have investigated temperature-dependent phonon properties in tetragonal SrTiO$_3$ (STO) and orthorhombic SrZrO$_3$ (SZO) perovskites. Within the quasiharmonic approximation, we have calculated the mode Grüneisen parameters, thermal expansion, and frequency shifts for several optical modes. These shifts show a downward trend with increasing temperature for almost all the modes in both systems and thus add to the normal behavior of frequencies with temperature. Next, within the third-order lattice anharmonic effect, we have investigated the temperature dependence of linewidths and lineshifts for several phonon modes. Except for a few modes, the lineshifts for most of the modes also show a downward trend with temperature and thus further leading to the normal temperature-dependent behavior of phonon modes. However, these lineshifts for a few optical modes in both the systems show an upward trend with increasing temperature, which, in principle, could lead to the anomalous temperature-dependent behavior of the frequencies of these modes; but when we add all the corrections including the quasiharmonic and third-order anharmonic shifts to the frequencies as obtained within the harmonic approximation, the frequencies of almost all the modes behave normally with temperature, i.e. they display blue shifts with cooling.",

\section{Conclusion and Limitation}

In this paper, we present the `Augment and Criticize' policies to construct a general framework for self-training-based semi-supervised monocular 3D object detection. The proposed APG aggregates predictions from different views of unlabeled images for robust label generation. The CRS adopts a learnable critical module to measure the reward of each pseudo sample and filter noisy ones to enhance model training. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. 

We hope our work could enlighten more research on semi-supervised monocular 3D object detection. There exists one limitation that we leave to future work: As presented in Tab.~\ref{tab:label_unlabel_ratio}, detection performance grows with the unlabeled data volume yet it has not impressively plateaued. Naturally, restocking more unlabeled samples from other sources (\textit{e.g.} Waymo~\cite{waymo} and nuScenes~\cite{nuscenes}) could further enhance the detection methods. However, the domain gap in different sources may compromise the effectiveness of semi-supervised learning. In future work, we will devote more effort to mitigate this gap for exploiting more unlabeled data, which we believe can further facilitate semi-supervised Mono3D tasks.

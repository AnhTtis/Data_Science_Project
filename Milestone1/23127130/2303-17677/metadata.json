    "abstract": "We propose a definition by generators and relations of the rank $n-2$ Askey--Wilson algebra $aw(n)$ for any integer $n$, generalising the known presentation for the usual case $n=3$. The generators are indexed by connected subsets of $\\{1,\\dots,n\\}$ and the simple and rather small set of defining relations is directly inspired from the known case of $n=3$. Our first main result is to prove the existence of automorphisms of $aw(n)$ satisfying the relations of the braid group on $n+1$ strands. We also show the existence of coproduct maps relating the algebras for different values of $n$. An immediate consequence of our approach is that the Askey--Wilson algebra defined here surjects onto the algebra generated by the intermediate Casimir elements in the $n$-fold tensor product of the quantum group $U_q(sl_2)$ or, equivalently, onto the Kauffman bracket skein algebra of the $(n+1)$-punctured sphere. We also obtain a family of central elements of the Askey--Wilson algebras which are shown, as a direct by-product of our construction, to be sent to $0$ in the realisation in the $n$-fold tensor product of $U_q(sl_2)$, thereby producing a large number of relations for the algebra generated by the intermediate Casimir elements.",

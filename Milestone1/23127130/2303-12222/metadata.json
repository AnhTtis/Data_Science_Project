    "abstract": "A bijective mapping $f: V(G) \\rightarrow \\left\\{1,2,\\ldots,n\\right\\}$ is called a \\emph{Distance Magic Labeling (DML) of $G$} if ~ ${\\sum_{v \\in N(u)}} f(v) $ is a constant for all $u\\in V(G)$ where $G$ is a simple graph of order $n$ and $N(u)$ = $\\{v\\in V(G):$ $uv\\in E(G)\\}$. Graph $G$ is called a \\emph{Distance Magic Graph (DMG)} if it has a DML, otherwise it is called a \\emph{Non-Distance Magic (NDM) graph}. In 1996, Vilfred proposed a conjecture that cylindrical grid graphs $P_m \\Box C_n$ are NDM for $m \\geq 2$, $n \\geq 3$ and $m,n\\in\\mathbb{N}$. Recently, the authors could prove the conjecture for the case when $m$ is even by introducing neighbourhood chains of Type-1 (NC-T1) and Type-2 (NC-T2). In this paper, they introduce neighbourhood chains of Type-3 (NC-T3) and using them completely settle the conjecture and also identify families of NDM graphs.",

\caption{Experiment result graph. The y-axis value represents the score drop of the perturbed caption as a percentage difference compared to the original caption. The experiment is conducted with four datasets, and we report the average of the languages to confirm the results for each perturbation. As a result, it can be seen that PR-MCS is more robust than baseline metrics for all perturbations across all datasets.}

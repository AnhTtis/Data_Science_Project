    "abstract": "An important challenge in Geometric Modeling is to classify polytopes with rational linear precision. Equivalently, in Algebraic Statistics one is interested in classifying scaled toric varieties, also known as discrete exponential families, for which the maximum likelihood estimator can be written in closed form as a rational function of the data (rational MLE). The toric fiber product (TFP) of statistical models is an operation to iteratively construct new models with rational MLE from lower dimensional ones. In this paper we introduce TFPs to the Geometric Modeling setting to construct polytopes with rational linear precision and give explicit formulae for their blending functions. A special case of the TFP is taking the Cartesian product of two polytopes and their blending functions. The Horn matrix of a statistical model with rational MLE is a key player in both Geometric Modeling and Algebraic Statistics; it proved to be fruitful providing a characterisation of those polytopes having the more restrictive property of strict linear precision. We give an explicit description of the Horn matrix of a TFP.",

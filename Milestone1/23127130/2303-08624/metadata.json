    "abstract": "We discuss loop-corrections to the electric current produced by strong and lengthy electric pulse. Namely we calculate one loop contribution to the electric current, distinguishing terms which depend on the pulse duration. We show that one loop correction does not lead to a strong modification of the tree-level current, which linearly grows with the pulse duration. Meanwhile, the correction to the photon propagator does contain the additional secular growth with the pulse duration. Based on the latter observation we argue that higher loop corrections will strongly modify the tree-level current, but that will demand a longer duration of the pulse than if the growth was at the first loop level.",

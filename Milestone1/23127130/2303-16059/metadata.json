    "abstract": "Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) is an effective algorithm for resolving Maxwell equations directly in time domain. Although FDTD has obtained sufficient development, there still exists some improvement space for it, such as ultra-wide-band response and frequency-dependent nonlinearity. In order to resolve these troubles, a modified version of FDTD called complex-field frequency-decomposition (CFFD) FDTD method is introduced, in which the complex-field is adopted to eliminate pseudo-frequency components when computing nonlinearity and the frequency-decomposition is adopted to transform an ultra-wide-band response into a series of narrow-band responses when computing the interaction of ultra-short pulse with matters. Its successful applications in several typical situations and comparison with other methods sufficiently verify the uniqueness and superiority in processing ultra-wide-band response and frequency-dependent nonlinearity.",

    "abstract": "Let $B=\\{ B_{t}\\} _{t\\ge 0}$ be a one-dimensional standard Brownian motion. As an application of a recent result of ours on exponential functionals of Brownian motion, we show in this paper that, for every fixed $t>0$, the process given by \\begin{align*}\n  B_{s}-B_{t}-\\Bigl|\n  B_{t}+\\max _{0\\le u\\le s}B_{u}-\\max _{s\\le u\\le t}B_{u}\n  \\Bigr|\n  +\\Bigl|\n  \\max _{0\\le u\\le s}B_{u}-\\max _{s\\le u\\le t}B_{u}\n  \\Bigr| ,\\quad 0\\le s\\le t, \\end{align*} is a Brownian motion. The path transformation that describes the above process is proven to be an involution, commute with time reversal, and preserve Pitman's transformation. A connection with Pitman's $2M-X$ theorem is also discussed.",

    "abstract": "We study the critical behavior at the ordinary surface universality class of the three-dimensional O($N$) model, bounded by a two-dimensional surface. Using high-precision Monte Carlo simulations of an improved lattice model, where the leading bulk scaling correction is suppressed, and finite-size scaling analysis of the fourth cumulant of the surface magnetization, we obtain precise estimates of the scaling dimension of the surface field operator for $N=2,3,4$. We also determine the fixed-point values of two renormalization-group invariant observables, which characterize the finite-size scaling behavior at the ordinary transition.",

\section{Human Evaluation Experiment Details}

The experiment was carried out using Amazon Mechanical Turk. Participants received compensation at a rate of \$1.7 per HIT, which roughly translated to an hourly wage of \$17. The variation in inter-annotator agreement for scoring five options, as denoted by Cohen's kappa, ranged between 0.41 (for JFLEG) and 0.32 (for BEA-2019).

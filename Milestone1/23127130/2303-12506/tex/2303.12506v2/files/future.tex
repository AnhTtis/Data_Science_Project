\label{sec:future}
% Whenever a new solution concept is defined, one of the most intuitive questions is how it can be related to other properties? 
We presented a practical solution to the problem of leximin optimization when only an approximate single-objective solver is available. 
The algorithm is guaranteed to terminate in polynomial time, and its approximation ratio degrades gracefully as a function of the approximation ratio of the single-objective solver.

It may be interesting to identify more problems (in addition to stochastic allocations), where an approximate egalitarian solution can be converted into an approximate leximin solution using the approach in this paper.
In particular, in the problem of stochastic allocations (in Section \ref{sec:app}), to extend the approximation algorithm for the egalitarian welfare, we had to change some steps within.
What if an algorithm for egalitarian welfare is provided as a black box --- could it be used to design the appropriate procedure to approximate leximin?

In the context of fair division, this study assumes that there is an access to the true valuations of the agents involved. 
In reality, people may lie about their valuations.
Can our definition of approximate-leximin be related to some approximate version of truthfulness?

Another question is whether it is possible to obtain a better approximation factor for leximin, given an $(\multApprox, \additiveApprox)$-approximation algorithm for the single-objective problem.
Specifically, can an $(\multApprox, \additiveApprox)$-approximation to leximin can be obtained in polynomial time? 
If not, what would be the best possible approximation in this case?

Further, the algorithm suggested in Section \ref{sec:algo-short} tend to work very well if the single-objective optimization problems are convex, and in particular if they are linear programs. 
\erel{Why? the algorithm of \textcite{Ogryczak2004TelecommunicationsND} works even for non-convex programs.}
Can we find an algorithm that works with general approximation algorithms? For example, naive algorithms such as \emph{Next-fit}?

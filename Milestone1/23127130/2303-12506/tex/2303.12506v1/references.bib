	abstract = {We consider a setting where a large number of agents are all interested in attending some public resource of limited capacity. Attendance is thus allotted by lottery. If agents arrive individually, then randomly choosing the agents – one by one - is a natural, fair and efﬁcient solution. We consider the case where agents are organized in groups (e.g. families, friends), the members of each of which must all be admitted together. We study the question of how best to design such lotteries. We ﬁrst establish the desired properties of such lotteries, in terms of fairness and efﬁciency, and deﬁne the appropriate notions of strategy proofness (providing that agents cannot gain by misrepresenting the true groups, e.g. joining or splitting groups). We establish inter-relationships between the different properties, proving properties that cannot be fulﬁlled simultaneously (e.g. leximin optimality and strong group stratagy proofness). Our main contribution is a polynomial mechanism for the problem, which guarantees many of the desired properties, including: leximin optimality, Paretooptimality, anonymity, group strategy proofness, and adjunctive strategy proofness (which provides that no beneﬁt can be obtained by registering additional - uninterested or bogus individuals). The mechanism approximates the utilitarian optimum to within a factor of 2, which, we prove, is optimal for any mechanism that guarantees any one of the following properties: egalitarian welfare optimality, leximin optimality, envyfreeness, and adjunctive strategy proofness.},

This is typically the case in problems implying human agents, where fairness and efficiency requirements must be met. Preference handling, resource allocation problems are another examples of the need for balanced compromises between several conflicting objectives. A way to characterize good solutions in such problems is to use the leximin preorder to compare the vectors of objective values, and to select the solutions which maximize this preorder. In this article, we describe five algorithms for finding leximin-optimal solutions using constraint programming. Three of these algorithms are original. Other ones are adapted, in constraint programming settings, from existing works. The algorithms are compared experimentally on three benchmark problems.},

With the aid of the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator we suggest an analytic formulation for the Leximin method. Some properties of this formulation are provided. We then describe the application of this new formulation for the Leximin method to situations in which the constraints are describable in a linear fashion.

Drawing inspiration from work in multi-criteria decision making and social choice theory we use order weighted averages (OWAs), a parameterized class of mean aggregators, to propose a novel and ﬂexible class of algorithms for the assignment problem. We show an algorithm for ﬁnding an Σ-OWA assignment in polynomial time, in contrast to the NP-hardness of ﬁnding an egalitarian assignment. We demonstrate through empirical experiments that using Σ-OWA assignments can lead to high quality and more fair assignments.},

Examples of such portioning problems are participatory budgeting, time shares, and parliament elections. We introduce a family of rules for portioning, inspired by positional scoring rules. Rules in this family are given by a scoring vector (such as plurality or Borda) associating a positive value with each rank in a vote, and an aggregation function such as leximin or the Nash product. Our family contains well-studied rules, but most are new. We discuss computational and normative properties of our rules. We focus on fairness, and introduce the SD-core, a group fairness notion. Our Nash rules are in the SD-core, and the leximin rules satisfy individual fairness properties. Both are Pareto-efﬁcient.},

abstract = {Often one would like to allocate shared resources in a fair way. A common and well-studied notion of fairness is Max-Min Fairness, where we first maximize the smallest allocation, and subject to that the second smallest, and so on. We consider a networking application where multiple commodities compete over the capacity of a network. In our setting, each commodity has multiple possible paths to route its demand (for example, a network using Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) tunneling). In this setting, the only known way of finding a max-min fair allocation requires an iterative solution of multiple linear programs. Such an approach, although polynomial time, scales badly with the size of the network, the number of demands, and the number of paths, and is hard to implement in a distributed environment. More importantly, a network operator has limited control and understanding of the inner working of the algorithm.In this article we introduce Upward Max-Min Fairness, a novel relaxation of Max-Min Fairness, and present a family of simple dynamics that converge to it. These dynamics can be implemented in a distributed manner. Moreover, we present an efficient combinatorial algorithm for finding an upward max-min fair allocation. This algorithm is a natural extension of the well-known Water Filling Algorithm for a multiple path setting.We test the expected behavior of this new algorithm and show that on realistic networks upward max-min fair allocations are comparable to the max-min fair allocations both in fairness and in network utilization.},

	abstract = {Robustness in Operations Research/Decision Aid is often associated with min–max and min–max regret criteria. This common approach to determine robust solutions consists in ﬁnding a solution which minimizes the maximal cost or regret. Nevertheless, these criteria are known to be too conservative. In this paper, we present and study a new robustness approach, called lexicographic a-robustness, which compensates for this major drawback and many others. Furthermore, we establish a link between lexicographic a-robustness and a third robustness approach called p-robustness.},

	abstract = {Finding a representative cohort from a broad pool of candidates is a goal that arises in many contexts such as choosing governing committees and consumer panels. While there are many ways to deﬁne the degree to which a cohort represents a population, a very appealing solution concept is lexicographic maximality (leximax) which oﬀers a natural (pareto-optimal like) interpretation that the utility of no population can be increased without decreasing the utility of a population that is already worse oﬀ. However, ﬁnding a leximax solution can be highly dependent on small variations in the utility of certain groups. In this work, we explore new notions of approximate leximax solutions with three distinct motivations: better algorithmic eﬃciency, exploiting signiﬁcant utility improvements, and robustness to noise. Among other deﬁnitional contributions, we give a new notion of an approximate leximax that satisﬁes a similarly appealing semantic interpretation and relate it to algorithmically-feasible approximate leximax notions. When group utilities are linear over cohort candidates, we give an eﬃcient polynomial-time algorithm for ﬁnding a leximax distribution over cohort candidates in the exact as well as in the approximate setting. Furthermore, we show that ﬁnding an integer solution to leximax cohort selection with linear utilities is NP-Hard.},

@misc{baghel_fair_2022,
	title = {Fair {Division} {Algorithms} for {Electricity} {Distribution}},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14531},
	abstract = {In many developing countries, the total electricity demand is larger than the limited generation capacity of power stations. Many countries adopt the common practice of routine load shedding — disconnecting entire regions from the power supply — to maintain a balance between demand and supply. Load shedding results in inﬂicting hardship and discomfort on households, which is even worse and hence unfair to those whose need for electricity is higher than that of others during load shedding hours. Recently, Oluwasuji et al. [2020] presented this problem and suggested several heuristic solutions. In this work, we study the electricity distribution problem as a problem of fair division, model it using the related literature on cake-cutting problems, and discuss some insights on which parts of the time intervals are allocated to each household. We consider four cases: identical demand, uniform utilities; identical demand, additive utilities; different demand, uniform utilities; different demand, additive utilities. We provide the solution for the ﬁrst two cases and discuss the novel concept of q-times bin packing in relation to the remaining cases. We also show how the fourth case is related to the consensus k-division problem. One can study objectives and constraints using utilitarian and egalitarian social welfare metrics, as well as trying to keep the number of cuts as small as possible. A secondary objective can be to minimize the maximum utility-difference between agents.},

We propose an (approximation) algorithm to ﬁnd a stochastic allocation that maximizes the minimum utility among the agents. The algorithm runs by repeatedly ﬁnding an (approximate) allocation to maximize the total virtual utility of the agents. This implies that the problem is solvable in polynomial time when the utilities are gross-substitutes (which is a subclass of submodular). When the utilities are submodular, we can ﬁnd a (1 − 1/e)-approximate solution for the problem and this is best possible unless P=NP. We also extend the problem where a stochastic allocation must satisfy the (ex ante) envy-freeness. Under this condition, we demonstrate that the problem is NP-hard even when every agent has an additive utility with a matroid constraint (which is a subclass of grosssubstitutes). Furthermore, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm for the setting with a restriction that the matroid constraint is common to all agents.},

abstract="The approach called the Lexicographic Min-Max (LMM) optimization depends on searching for solutions minimal according to the lex-max order on a multidimensional outcome space. LMM is a refinement of the standard Min-Max optimization, but in the former, in addition to the largest outcome, we minimize also the second largest outcome (provided that the largest one remains as small as possible), minimize the third largest (provided that the two largest remain as small as possible), and so on. The necessity of point-wise ordering of outcomes within the lexicographic optimization scheme causes that the LMM problem is hard to implement. For convex problems it is possible to use iterative algorithms solving a sequence of properly defined Min-Max problems by eliminating some blocked outcomes. In general, it may not exist any blocked outcome thus disabling possibility of iterative Min-Max processing. In this paper we analyze two alternative optimization models allowing to form lexicographic sequential procedures for various nonconvex (possibly discrete) LMM problems. Both the approaches are based on sequential optimization of directly defined artificial criteria. The criteria can be introduced into the original model with some auxiliary variables and linear inequalities thus the methods are easily implementable.",

The minimax solution concept, despite the most commonly used in the public sector location models, is criticized as it does not comply with the major principles of the efficiency and equity modeling. In this paper we develop a concept of the lexicographic minimax solution (lexicographic center) being a refinement of the standard minimax approach to location problems. We show that the lexicographic minimax approach complies with both the Pareto-optimality (efficiency) principle (crucial in multiple criteria optimization) and the principle of transfers (essential for equity measures) whereas the standard minimax approach may violate both these principles. Computational algorithms are developed for the lexicographic minimax solution of discrete location problems.}

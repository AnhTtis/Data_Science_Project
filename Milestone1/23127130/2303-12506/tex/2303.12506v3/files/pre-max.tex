\section{Preliminaries}\label{sec:preliminaries}

We denote the set $\{1,\dots, n\}$ by $[n]$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

 \paragraph{Single-objective optimization}
This paper focuses on maximization problems. Therefore, unless explicitly stated otherwise, optimization is viewed in terms of maximization.

A \emph{single-objective maximization problem} is a tuple $(S,f)$ where $S$ is the set of all feasible solutions to the problem (usually $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^m$ for some $m \in \mathbb{N}$) and $f \colon S \to \mathbb{R}$ is a function describing the objective value of a solution $x \in S$.
The goal in such problems is to find an \emph{optimal} solution, that is, a feasible solution $x^* \in S$ that has the maximum objective value, that is $f(x^*) \geq f(x)$ for any other solution $x \in S$.


An \emph{$(1-\multError,\additiveError)$-approximation algorithm} for a single-objective maximization problem $(S,f)$ is one that returns a  solution $x\in S$ that \emph{approximates} the optimal solution $x^*$ from below. That is, $f(x) \geq(1-\multError) \cdot f(x^*) - \additiveError$ for a $\multError  \in [0,1)$ and $\additiveError \geq 0$ (that describe the allowed multiplicative and additive error factors respectively).

% Similarly,  
% An \emph{$(1+\multError,\additiveError)$-approximation algorithm} for a single-objective \emph{minimization} problem is one that returns a feasible solution $x$ that \emph{approximates} the optimal solution $x^*$ from above. That is, $f(x) \leq(1+\multError) \cdot f(x^*) + \additiveError$ for a $\multError \geq 0$ and $\additiveError \geq 0$.

A \emph{$p$-randomized} approximation algorithm, for $p\in(0,1]$, is one that returns a solution $x\in S$ such that, with probability $p$, the objective value $f(x)$ is approximately-optimal.


\paragraph{Multi-objective optimization}
A \textit{multi-objective maximization} problem \cite{branke_multiobjective_2008} can be described as follows:
\begin{align*}
    \max \quad &\{f_1(x), f_2(x), \dots f_n(x)\} \\
    s.t. \quad  & x \in S
\end{align*}
Where $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}^m$ for some $m \in \mathbb{N}$ is the \textit{feasible region} and $f_1, f_2, \dots, f_n$ are $n$ \textit{objective-functions} $f_i\colon S \to \mathbb{R}$.
An example application is group decision making:
some $n$ people have to decide on an issue that affects all of them.
The set of possible decisions is $S$, and the utility each person $i$ derives from a decision $x\in S$ is $f_i(x)$.


% Our motivating application is fair resource allocation, which is a special case of group decision making in which $S$ is the set of all possible allocations.
% \eden{I'm not sure it is necessary since we said it in the introduction}
% \eden{we actually does not use the example application in this section... maybe to remove it?}
% \erel{I agree.}

\paragraph{The leximin order} Ideally, we would like to find a solution that would maximize the utility of all players. 
In practice, there may be conflicts among their interests. 
Therefore, when considering different possible solutions, we aim to find the fairest one.
% There are many ways to define fairness, but Pareto optimality is one of the most commonly used.
% A solution is considered a Pareto optimal solution if no other solution can increase some objective without decreasing another one.
%----------------------
% \paragraph{Leximin}
A known concept for measuring fairness is the leximin order which prefers solutions that are less offensive to the poorest ones. 
% \eden{It extends the \textit{egalitarian rule} \cite{}....}
More precisely, an optimal solution according to this order maximizes the smallest objective, subject to this maximizes the second-smallest objective, and so on.
\erel{We already described leximin informally in the intro, so we do not need to repeat it here; it is sufficient to show the formal definition.}
Note that the smallest objective value is known as the \textit{egalitarian value}; and in many cases, the problem of maximizing this value is interesting by itself.

\paragraph{Ordered outcomes notation}
The multiset of values achieved from a solution $x\in S$ is denoted by $\allValues{x} = \{f_i(x)\}_{i=1}^n$, and the $j$'th smallest objective-value by $\valBy{j}{x}$, i.e.,
\begin{align*}
    \valBy{1}{x} \leq \valBy{2}{x} \leq \dots \leq \valBy{n}{x}.
\end{align*}
% \eden{to do}
% \erel{Why do you switch from F to V and then to $\mathcal{V}$?}
% \eden{F is actually not needed. I tried $\textbf{V}$ to emphasize that it is a vector ("mathcal" does not become bold), would it be better to use $V_k^{\uparrow}$ for the $k$-th value?}
% \eden{We also need to think about how to handle the case where two (or more) functions get the same value (and then this is not well defined).}
% \yon{in which case, $\allValues{}$ is a multiset}
% \erel{We can say that we break ties arbitrarily. It does not matter very much, since we will only be interested in $\valBy{k}{x}$ and not in $\funcBy{k}{x}$ by its own, right?}
% \eden{how is this alternative notation? $\mathbf{F}(x,k)$}
% \erel{
% I am not sure; it might look as if $k$ is just another argument to $F$.
% }
% \eden{how about this one: $\mathcal{OBJ}_k(x)$ or this: $\mathcal{OBJ}_k^{\uparrow}(x)$}
% \eden{how about $\mathpzc{obj}_k^{\uparrow}(x)$}
% \eden{Or something with "V" (to represent objective \textbf{value}): $\mathpzc{V}_k^{\uparrow}(x)$}

\paragraph{The leximin order}
% A leximin-optimal solution is determined by the \emph{leximin order}, which depends on the following preferences relation:
% Accordingly, the leximin order is described as follows: a
A solution $y$ is considered \emph{leximin-preferred} over a solution $x$, denoted $y \leximinPreferred x$, if there exists an integer $k\in[n]$ such that the smallest $(k-1)$ objective values of both are equal, whereas the $k$'th smallest objective value of $y$ is higher:
\begin{align*}
    \forall j < k \colon \quad &\valBy{j}{y} = \valBy{j}{x}\\
    & \valBy{k}{y} > \valBy{k}{x}
\end{align*} 
The leximin order is a strict \emph{total} order --- two solution $x,y \in S$ that yields different multisets of values ($\allValues{x} \neq \allValues{y}$) are always comparable in the sense that either $x \leximinPreferred y$ or $y \leximinPreferred x$ but not both.
A \emph{maximum} element of the leximin order is a solution that is preferred over all the solutions that yield different utilities, i.e., a solution $x$ such that $x \leximinPreferred y$ for any $y$ for which $\allValues{x} \neq \allValues{y}$.
Notice that as any two solutions are comparable in the leximin order, $x \leximinPreferred y$ implies that $y \nLeximinPreferred x$, and so, a maximum element is also one over which \emph{no} solution is preferred (including solutions that yield the same utilities).
% \eden{would it be better to put it as an Observation?}
% \erel{I don't think so. It is quite well-known.}

\paragraph{Leximin optimal}
% As the order determines only by the utilities  maximum element 
% accordingly, the order has a unique
%
% every solution ($x \in S$) with a sorted utility vector $(\valBy{1}{x},\ldots,\valBy{n}{x})$ that corresponds to this element is called a \emph{leximin-optimal solution}.
A \emph{leximin optimal} solution is a maximum element of the leximin order.
% \er{
% Given a feasible region $S$, we are interested in finding a solution $x\in S$,  
% such that $\allObjFunc(x)$ is maximum in the leximin order. 
% We denote this optimization problem as follows. 
% \begin{align*}
% 	\lexmaxmin \quad &\{f_1(x), f_2(x), \dots f_n(x)\} \\
% 	s.t. \quad  & x \in S
% \end{align*}
% }
% Given a feasible region $S$, we are interested in finding a solution $x\in S$,  which is a maximum element of the leximin order. 
Given a feasible region $S$, as the order is determined only by the utilities, we denote this optimization problem as follows. 
\begin{align*}
	\lexmaxmin \quad &\{f_1(x), f_2(x), \dots f_n(x)\} \\
	s.t. \quad  & x \in S
\end{align*}
% \eden{maybe "$\maxlexmin \quad \{f_1(x), f_2(x), \dots f_n(x)\}$" since it is a maximal element according to the leximin order?..}
% \erel{Both are equally good IMO.}

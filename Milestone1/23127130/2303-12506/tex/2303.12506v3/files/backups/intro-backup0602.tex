% title: real life motivation
As people may have divergent interests and perspectives, making a decision that affects many might be a challenging task. 
For instance, when dividing a set of items, the \emph{best} decision depends on the individuals' preferences. 
If each individual wants a different subset of the items, it is easy to see that giving each one the subset it prefers is the best solution.
However, if everyone wants the same item and wants only that item, perhaps joint ownership or rotation would make more sense.

% technical terms
Such a situation can be described as a \emph{multi-objective optimization problem}, which includes defining the set of possible decisions and the different objectives.
Although the best decision may be determined in several different ways, this paper focuses on \emph{Leximin} optimization  which aims to be less offensive to the poorest ones.
A Leximin optimal solution maximizes the smallest objective, subject to this maximizes the second-smallest objective, and so on.

% Algorithms 
Common algorithms for finding a Leximin optimal solution are iterative, solving one or more single-objective optimization problems at each iteration.
When these problems cannot be solved exactly, and particularly if they are NP-hard, what is the best we can do in the terms of Leximin?




\paragraph{Contributions}
This paper studies the problem of Leximin optimization in multi-objective optimization problems under polynomial time restriction.
It focuses on problems that are NP-hard even for the first objective maximization.
Our contribution can be divided into three parts.
First, a new definition of approximate Leximin is presented, which captures multiplicative errors that are commonly associated with approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems.
The definition has several desirable properties, including that a Leximin optimal solution is also approximately-optimal (for any approximation factor), and that the definition is equivalent to the original one in the absence of errors.
Second, an algorithm is provided that, given a single-objective approximation algorithm, computes such an approximation. 
We prove that the accuracy of the returned solution is linearly related to the accuracy of the single-objective approximation algorithm, and that the error factor is at most doubled when moving from the single-objective to the multi-objective setting. 
Importantly, this holds for any number of objectives. 
Lastly, we apply the method to the problem of stochastic allocations of indivisible goods. 
When agents have submodular utilities, approximating the egalitarian value is NP-hard.
We demonstrate that our method enables extending the \cite{kawase_max-min_2020} $(1-\frac{1}{e})$-approximation algorithm for the egalitarian value to approximating the Leximin to with a factor of $(1-\frac{2}{e})$.




\paragraph{Organization} 
Section \ref{sec:approx-leximin-def} presents the definition of approximate Leximin in the presence of \emph{multiplicative} errors.
An algorithm for computing such an approximation is presented in Section \ref{sec:algo-short}.
The problem of stochastic allocations of indivisible goods is considered in Section \ref{sec:app}.
Lastly, Section \ref{sec:future} concludes with future work.

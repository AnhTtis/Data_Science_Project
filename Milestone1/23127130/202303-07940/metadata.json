    "abstract": "AI-based digital twins are at the leading edge of the Industry 4.0\nrevolution, which are technologically empowered by the Internet of Things and\nreal-time data analysis. Information collected from industrial assets is\nproduced in a continuous fashion, yielding data streams that must be processed\nunder stringent timing constraints. Such data streams are usually subject to\nnon-stationary phenomena, causing that the data distribution of the streams may\nchange, and thus the knowledge captured by models used for data analysis may\nbecome obsolete (leading to the so-called concept drift effect). The early\ndetection of the change (drift) is crucial for updating the model's knowledge,\nwhich is challenging especially in scenarios where the ground truth associated\nto the stream data is not readily available. Among many other techniques, the\nestimation of the model's confidence has been timidly suggested in a few\nstudies as a criterion for detecting drifts in unsupervised settings. The goal\nof this manuscript is to confirm and expose solidly the connection between the\nmodel's confidence in its output and the presence of a concept drift,\nshowcasing it experimentally and advocating for a major consideration of\nuncertainty estimation in comparative studies to be reported in the future.",

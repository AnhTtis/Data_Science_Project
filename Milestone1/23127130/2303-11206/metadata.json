    "abstract": "Rödl and Ruciński (1990) established Ramsey's theorem for random graphs. In particular, for fixed integers $r$, $\\ell\\geq 2$ they showed that $\\hat p_{K_\\ell,r}(n)=n^{-\\frac{2}{\\ell+1}}$ is a threshold for the Ramsey property that every $r$-colouring of the edges of the binomial random graph $G(n,p)$ yields a monochromatic copy of $K_\\ell$. We investigate how this result extends to arbitrary colourings of $G(n,p)$ with an unbounded number of colours. In this situation, Erdős and Rado showed that canonically coloured copies of $K_\\ell$ can be ensured in the deterministic setting. We transfer the Erdős-Rado theorem to the random environment and show that both thresholds coincide for $\\ell\\geq 4$. As a consequence, the proof yields $K_{\\ell+1}$-free graphs $G$ for which every edge colouring contains a canonically coloured $K_\\ell$.\n  The $0$-statement of the threshold is a direct consequence of the corresponding statement of the Rödl-Ruciński theorem and the main contribution is the $1$-statement. The proof of the $1$-statement employs the transference principle of Conlon and Gowers.",

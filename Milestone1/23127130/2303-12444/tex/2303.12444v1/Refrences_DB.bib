    abstract = { This paper proposes a new mechanism for combinatorial assignment—for example, assigning schedules of courses to students—based on an approximation to competitive equilibrium from equal incomes (CEEI) in which incomes are unequal but arbitrarily close together. The main technical result is an existence theorem for approximate CEEI. The mechanism is approximately efficient, satisfies two new criteria of outcome fairness, and is strategyproof in large markets. Its performance is explored on real data, and it is compared to alternatives from theory and practice: all other known mechanisms are either unfair ex post or manipulable even in large markets, and most are both manipulable and unfair. }

abstract = {We explore the allocation problem in combinatorial auctions with submodular bidders. We provide an e/e-1 approximation algorithm for this problem. Moreover, our algorithm applies to the more general class of XOS bidders. By presenting a matching unconditional lower bound in the communication model, we prove that the upper bound is tight for the XOS class.Our algorithm improves upon the previously known 2-approximation algorithm. In fact, we also exhibit another algorithm which obtains an approximation ratio better than 2 for submodular bidders, even in the value queries model.Throughout the paper we highlight interesting connections between combinatorial auctions with XOS and submodular bidders and various other combinatorial optimization problems. In particular, we discuss coverage problems and online problems.},

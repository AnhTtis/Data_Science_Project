    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the stochastic Boussinesq equations on $\\mathbb T^3$ with transport noise and rough initial data. We first prove the existence and uniqueness of the local pathwise solution with initial data in $L^p(Ω;L^p)$ for $p>5$. By assuming additional smallness on the initial data and the noise, we establish the global existence of the pathwise solution.",

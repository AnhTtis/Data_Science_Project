    "abstract": "In 2011, the theory of $\\mathcal I^K$-convergence gets birth as an extension of the concept of $\\mathcal{I}^*$-convergence of sequences of real numbers. $\\mathcal I^K$-limit points and $\\mathcal I^K$-cluster points of functions are introduced and studied to some extent, where $\\mathcal{I}$ and $\\mathcal{K}$ are ideals on a non-empty set $S$. In a first countable space set of $\\mathcal I^K$-cluster points is coincide with the closure of all sets in the filter base $\\mathcal{B}_f(\\mathcal{I^K})$ for some function $f : S\\to X$. Frechet compactness is studied in light of ideals $\\mathcal{I}$ and $\\mathcal{K}$ of subsets of $S$ and showed that in $\\mathcal{I}$-sequential $T_2$ space frechet compactness and $\\mathcal{I}$-frechet compactness are equivalent. A class of ideals have been identified for which $\\mathcal I^K$-frechet compactness coincides with $\\mathcal{I}$-frechet compactness in first countable spaces.",

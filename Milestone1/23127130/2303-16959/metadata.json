    "abstract": "These twenty-two lectures, with exercises, comprise the extent of what was meant to be a full-year graduate-level course on the strong interactions and QCD, given at Pactech in 19$xx$-$xy$. The course was cut short by the illness that led to Finemensch's death. Several of the lectures were finalized in collaboration with Finemensch for an anticipated monograph based on the course. The others, while retaining Finemensch's idiosyncrasies, are revised similarly to those he was able to check. His distinctive approach and manner of presentation are manifest throughout. Near the end he suggests a novel, nonperturbative formulation of quantum field theory in $D$ dimensions. Supplementary material is provided in appendices and ancillary files, including verbatim transcriptions of three lectures and the corresponding audiotaped recordings.",

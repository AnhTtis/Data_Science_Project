abstract = {In this work, we propose the first backdoor attack to graph neural networks (GNN). Specifically, we propose a subgraph based backdoor attack to GNN for graph classification. In our backdoor attack, a GNN classifier predicts an attacker-chosen target label for a testing graph once a predefined subgraph is injected to the testing graph. Our empirical results on three real-world graph datasets show that our backdoor attacks are effective with a small impact on a GNN's prediction accuracy for clean testing graphs. Moreover, we generalize a randomized smoothing based certified defense to defend against our backdoor attacks. Our empirical results show that the defense is effective in some cases but ineffective in other cases, highlighting the needs of new defenses for our backdoor attacks.},

abstract = {Graph neural networks (GNNs) have pushed the state-of-the-art (SOTA) for performance in learning and predicting on large-scale data present in social networks, biology, etc. Since integrated circuits (ICs) can naturally be represented as graphs, there has been a tremendous surge in employing GNNs for machine learning (ML)-based methods for various aspects of IC design. Given this trajectory, there is a timely need to review and discuss some powerful and versatile GNN approaches for advancing IC design.In this paper, we propose a generic pipeline for tailoring GNN models toward solving challenging problems for IC design. We outline promising options for each pipeline element, and we discuss selected and promising works, like leveraging GNNs to break SOTA logic obfuscation. Our comprehensive overview of GNNs frameworks covers (i) electronic design automation (EDA) and IC design in general, (ii) design of reliable ICs, and (iii) design as well as analysis of secure ICs. We provide our overview and related resources also in the GNN4IC hub at https://github.com/DfX-NYUAD/GNN4IC. Finally, we discuss interesting open problems for future research.},

isbn = {9781450324779},
abstract = {Hardware design today bears similarities to software design. Often vendors buy and integrate code acquired from third-party organizations into their designs, especially in embedded/system-on-chip designs. Currently, there is no way to determine if third-party designs have built-in backdoors that can compromise security after deployment.The key observation we use to approach this problem is that hardware backdoors incorporate logic that is nearly-unused, i.e. stealthy. The wires used in stealthy backdoor circuits almost never influence the outputs of those circuits. Typically, they do so only when triggered using external inputs from an attacker. In this paper, we present FANCI, a tool that flags suspicious wires, in a design, which have the potential to be malicious. FANCI uses scalable, approximate, boolean functional analysis to detect these wires.Our examination of the TrustHub hardware backdoor benchmark suite shows that FANCI is able to flag all suspicious paths in the benchmarks that are associated with backdoors. Unlike prior work in the area, FANCI is not hindered by incomplete test suite coverage and thus is able to operate in practice without false negatives. Furthermore, FANCI reports low false positive rates: less than 1% of wires are reported as suspicious in most cases. All TrustHub designs were analyzed in a day or less. We also analyze a backdoor-free out-of-order microprocessor core to demonstrate applicability beyond benchmarks.},

    "abstract": "In this technical note, we generalize the well-known Lyapunov-based stabilizability and detectability tests for linear time-invariant (LTI) systems to the context of discrete-time (DT) polytopic linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems. To do so, we exploit the mathematical structure of the class of poly-quadratic Lyapunov functions, which enables us to formulate conditions in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Our results differ from existing conditions in that we adopt weaker assumptions on the parameter dependence of the controllers/observers and our method does not require explicitly incorporating these gains, which renders the new conditions less computationally demanding. Interestingly, our results also have important implications for existing controller and observer synthesis techniques based on poly-QLFs. In fact, we show that existing observer synthesis results are stronger than was anticipated in the sense that they are necessary for a larger class of observers. Moreover, we also introduce new controller synthesis conditions and illustrate our results by means of a numerical case study.",

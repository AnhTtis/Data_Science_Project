    "abstract": "We numerically study the shear rheology of a binary mixture of soft Active Brownian Particles, from the fluid to the disordered solid regime. At low shear rates, we find a Newtonian regime, where a Green-Kubo relation with an effective temperature provides the linear viscosity. It is followed by a shear-thinning regime at larger shear rates. At high densities, solidification is signalled by the emergence of a finite yield stress. We construct a ``fluid-glass-jamming'' phase diagram with activity replacing temperature. While both parameters gauge fluctuations, activity also changes the exponent characterizing the decay of the diffusivity close to the glass transition and the shape of the yield stress surface. The dense disordered active solid appears to be mostly dominated by athermal jamming rather than glass rheology.",

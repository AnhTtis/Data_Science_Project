An overview of the different solution approaches and the existing algorithms is given. We focus on deterministic algorithms for SIPs which do not make any convexity assumptions. In particular, we consider the case that the constraint function is non-concave with respect to parameters. Advances and disadvantages of the different algorithms are discussed. We also highlight recent SIP applications. The article closes with a discussion on remaining challenges and future research directions.},

    "abstract": "Coupled laboratory-numerical experiments of Rayleigh-Bénard convection (RBC) in liquid gallium subject to a vertical magnetic field are presented. The experiments are carried out in two cylindrical containers with diameter-to-height aspect ratio $Γ= 1.0$ and $2.0$ at varying thermal forcing (Rayleigh numbers $10^5 \\lesssim Ra \\lesssim 10^8$) and magnetic field strength (Chandrasekhar numbers $0\\lesssim Ch \\lesssim 3\\times 10^5$). Laboratory measurements and numerical simulations confirm that magnetoconvection in our finite cylindrical tanks onsets via non-drifting wall-attached modes, in good agreement with asymptotic predictions for a semi-infinite domain. With increasing supercriticality, the experimental and numerical thermal measurements and the numerical velocity data reveal transitions between wall mode states with different azimuthal mode numbers and between wall-dominated convection to wall and interior multimodality. These transitions are also reflected in the heat transfer data, which combined with previous studies, connect onset to supercritical turbulent behaviors in liquid metal magnetoconvection over a large parameter space. The gross heat transfer behaviors between magnetoconvection and rotating convection in liquid metals are compared and discussed.",

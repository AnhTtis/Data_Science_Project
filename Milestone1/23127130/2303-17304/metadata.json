    "abstract": "This paper develops a control scheme, based on the use of Long Short-Term Memory neural network models and Nonlinear Model Predictive Control, which guarantees recursive feasibility with slow time variant set-points and disturbances, input and output constraints and unmeasurable state. Moreover, if the set-point and the disturbance are asymptotically constant, robust asymptotic stability and offset-free tracking are guaranteed. Offset-free tracking is obtained by augmenting the model with a disturbance, to be estimated together with the states of the Long Short-Term Memory network model by a properly designed observer. Satisfaction of the output constraints in presence of observer estimation error, time varying set-points and disturbances is obtained using a constraint tightening approach.",

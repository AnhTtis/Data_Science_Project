The measurements were made through the visible spectrum and extended to 1.5 microns in the infrared by the use of an infrared sensitive screen.The dispersion curves and the equations for the curves were determined. Values taken from the curves were found to agree moderately well with published values. The results demonstrate the high dispersion and the large birefringence of rutile. The experimental results also demonstrate the strong absorption of rutile in the violet end of the visible spectrum which accounts for the slight yellow color of rutile.},

@article{SGP,
   abstract = {The optimal design of nanoparticles with respect to their optical properties is one of the main foci within nanoparticle technology. In this contribution, we suggest a new design optimization method in the framework of which the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) is used to approximate the solution of Maxwell’s equation in time-harmonic form. In the core of the optimization method, each dipole is repeatedly assigned a material property from a given material catalog until a local minimum for the chosen design objective is obtained. The design updates are computed using a separable model of the optimization objective, which can be solved to global optimality, giving rise to a sequential global optimization (SGP) algorithm. We suggest different types of separable models, among them exact separable models as well as tight approximations of the latter which are numerically tractable. The application of the DDA method in the framework of structural design methods widens the spectrum of numerically tractable layout problems in optical applications as, compared to finite element based approaches, significantly more complex design spaces can be investigated.},

abstract  ="Natural structural color materials{,} especially those that can undergo reversible changes{,} are attracting increasing interest in a wide variety of research fields. Inspired by the natural creatures{,} many elaborately nanostructured photonic materials with variable structural colors were developed. These materials have found important applications in switches{,} display devices{,} sensors{,} and so on. In this critical review{,} we will provide up-to-date research concerning the natural and bio-inspired photonic materials with variable structural colors. After introducing the variable structural colors in natural creatures{,} we will focus on the studies of artificial variable structural color photonic materials{,} including their bio-inspired designs{,} fabrications and applications. The prospects for the future development of these fantastic variable structural color materials will also be presented. We believe this review will promote the communications among biology{,} bionics{,} chemistry{,} optical physics{,} and material science (196 references)."}

 abstract = {Structurally colored materials are often used for their resistance to photobleaching and their complex viewing-direction-dependent optical properties. Frequently, absorption has been added to these types of materials in order to improve the color saturation by mitigating the effects of nonspecific scattering that is present in most samples due to imperfect manufacturing procedures. The combination of absorbing elements and structural coloration often yields emergent optical properties. Here, a new hybrid architecture is introduced that leads to an interesting, highly directional optical effect. By localizing absorption in a thin layer within a transparent, structurally colored multilayer material, an optical Janus effect is created, wherein the observed reflected color is different on one side of the sample than on the other. A systematic characterization of the optical properties of these structures as a function of their geometry and composition is performed. The experimental studies are coupled with a theoretical analysis that enables a precise, rational design of various optical Janus structures with highly controlled color, pattern, and fabrication approaches. These asymmetrically colored materials will open applications in art, architecture, semitransparent solar cells, and security features in anticounterfeiting materials.},

abstract = {A one-pot emulsion process produces noniridescent supraball inks made of core-shell melanin and silica nanoparticles. Structural colors enable the creation of a spectrum of nonfading colors without pigments, potentially replacing toxic metal oxides and conjugated organic pigments. However, significant challenges remain to achieve the contrast needed for a complete gamut of colors and a scalable process for industrial application. We demonstrate a feasible solution for producing structural colors inspired by bird feathers. We have designed core-shell nanoparticles using high–refractive index (RI) (~1.74) melanin cores and low-RI (~1.45) silica shells. The design of these nanoparticles was guided by finite-difference time-domain simulations. These nanoparticles were self-assembled using a one-pot reverse emulsion process, which resulted in bright and noniridescent supraballs. With the combination of only two ingredients, synthetic melanin and silica, we can generate a full spectrum of colors. These supraballs could be directly added to paints, plastics, and coatings and also used as ultraviolet-resistant inks or cosmetics.}}

abstract = {Abstract The natural world is a colorful environment. Stunning displays of coloration have evolved throughout nature to optimize camouflage, warning, and communication. The resulting flamboyant visual effects and remarkable dynamic properties, often caused by an intricate structural design at the nano- and microscale, continue to inspire scientists to unravel the underlying physics and to recreate the observed effects. Here, the methodologies to create bioinspired photonic pigments using colloidal self-assembly approaches are considered. The physics governing the interaction of light with structural features and natural examples of structural coloration are briefly introduced. It is then outlined how the self-assembly of colloidal particles, acting as wavelength-scale building blocks, can be particularly useful to replicate coloration from nature. Different coloration effects that result from the defined structure of the self-assembled colloids are introduced and it is highlighted how these optical properties can be translated into photonic pigments by modifications of the assembly processes. The importance of absorbing elements, as well as the role of surface chemistry and wettability to control structural coloration is discussed. Finally, approaches to integrate dynamic control of coloration into such self-assembled photonic pigments are outlined.},

@article{Yurkin2011,
abstract = {The open-source code ADDA is described, which implements the discrete dipole approximation (DDA), a method to simulate light scattering by finite 3D objects of arbitrary shape and composition. Besides standard sequential execution, ADDA can run on a multiprocessor distributed-memory system, parallelizing a single DDA calculation. Hence the size parameter of the scatterer is in principle limited only by total available memory and computational speed. ADDA is written in C99 and is highly portable. It provides full control over the scattering geometry (particle morphology and orientation, and incident beam) and allows one to calculate a wide variety of integral and angle-resolved scattering quantities (cross sections, the Mueller matrix, etc.). Moreover, ADDA incorporates a range of state-of-the-art DDA improvements, aimed at increasing the accuracy and computational speed of the method. We discuss both physical and computational aspects of the DDA simulations and provide a practical introduction into performing such simulations with the ADDA code. We also present several simulation results, in particular, for a sphere with size parameter 320 (100-wavelength diameter) and refractive index 1.05.},

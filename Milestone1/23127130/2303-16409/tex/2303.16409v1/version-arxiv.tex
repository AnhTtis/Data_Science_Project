\begin{abstract}{This paper investigates exact solutions of cosmological interest in fractional cosmology. Given $\mu$,  the order of the fractional derivative, and $w$, the matter equation of state, we present particular exact power-law solutions. We discuss the exact general solution of the system obtained by solving a Riccati Equation, where the solution for the scale factor is a combination of power-law. Using cosmological data, we estimate the free parameters $(\alpha_0, \mu)$,  where $H_{0}=100\frac{\text{km/s}}{\text{Mpc}}h$, and  $\alpha_0:=t_0 H_0 =  \frac{1}{6} \left(9 -2 \mu +\sqrt{8 \mu  (2 \mu -9)+105}\right)(1+ 2 \epsilon_0)$, is the current age parameter. The analysis from the SNe Ia data, OHD and the joint analysis with data from SNe Ia + OHD leads respectively to $h=0.696_{-0.295}^{+0.302}$, $\mu=1.340_{-0.339}^{+2.651}$ and  $\epsilon_0=\left(1.976_{-2.067}^{+1.709}\right)\times 10^{-2}$,   $h=0.675_{-0.021}^{+0.041}$, $\mu=2.239_{-1.190}^{+1.386}$ and $\epsilon_0=\left(0.865_{-0.773}^{+0.793}\right)\times 10^{-2}$, and  $h=0.684_{-0.027}^{+0.031}$, $\mu=1.840_{-0.773}^{+1.446}$ and $\epsilon_0=\left(1.213_{-1.057}^{+0.482}\right)\times 10^{-2}$, where the best-fit values are calculated at $3\sigma$ CL. On the other hand, these best-fit values lead to an age of the Universe with a value of $t_0=\alpha_0/H_0=25.62_{-4.46}^{+6.89}\;\text{Gyrs}$, a current deceleration parameter of $q_{0}=-0.37_{-0.11}^{+0.08}$, both at $3\sigma$ CL, and a current matter density parameter of $\Omega_{m,0}=0.531_{-0.260}^{+0.195}$ at $1\sigma$ CL. Finding a Universe roughly twice older as the one of $\Lambda$CDM is a distinction of Fractional Cosmology. Focusing our analysis on these results, we can conclude that the region in which $\mu>2$ is not ruled out by observations. This region of a parameter is relevant because, in the absence of matter, fractional cosmology gives a power-law solution $a(t)= \left(t/t_0\right)^{\mu-1}$, which is accelerated for $\mu>2$. We present a fractional origin model that leads to an accelerated state without appealing to $\Lambda$ or Dark Energy. }

\section{Introduction}
In fractional calculus, the classical derivatives and integrals of integer order are generalized to derivatives and integrals of arbitrary (real or complex) order \cite{monje2010fractional, Tarasov2013,bandyopadhyay2014stabilization,padula2014advances,herrmann2014fractional,tarasov2019applications,klafter2012fractional,malinowska2015advanced,lorenzo2016fractional}. Fractional derivatives have attracted increasing attention because they universally appear as empirical descriptions of complex social and physical phenomena. Fractional calculus applications have grown enormously in recent years because these operators have memory and are more flexible in describing the dynamic behaviour of phenomena and systems using fractional differential equations. While the description with integer order differential equations is with local operators, and they are limited in the order of differentiation to a constant. Consequently, the resulting models must describe with sufficient precision, in many cases \cite{west2021fractional}. Research into fractional differentiation is inherently multi-disciplinary and has applications across various disciplines, for example, fractional quantum mechanics and gravity for fractional spacetime \cite{Calcagni:2010bj, Calcagni:2009kc}, fractional quantum field theory \cite{Lim:2006hp, LimEab+2019+237+256, VargasMoniz:2020hve, Moniz:2020emn, Rasouli:2021lgy, Jalalzadeh:2021gtq}. Such frameworks have been essential in understanding complex systems in classical and quantum regimes.

Fractional calculus has recently been explored to address problems related to cosmology in 
\cite{Roberts:2009ix, Vacaru:2010fb, Vacaru:2010wj, Vacaru:2010wn, Shchigolev:2010vh, Jamil:2011uj, Shchigolev:2012rp, Debnath2012, El-Nabulsi:2012wpc, El-Nabulsi:2013mwa, El-Nabulsi:2013mma, Debnath2013, Shchigolev:2013jq, Calcagni:2013yqa, Shchigolev:2015rei, Rami:2015kha, El-Nabulsi:2015szp, El-Nabulsi:2016dsj, Calcagni:2016ofu, Calcagni:2016azd, El-Nabulsi:2017vmp, El-Nabulsi:2017jss, Calcagni:2017via, Calcagni:2019ngc,  Calcagni:2020tvw, Calcagni:2020ads, Calcagni:2021ipd, Calcagni:2021aap, Shchigolev:2021lbm, Jalalzadeh:2022uhl, Garcia-Aspeitia:2022uxz, Micolta-Riascos:2023mqo}. In reference  \cite{Garcia-Aspeitia:2022uxz}, a joint analysis using data from cosmic chronometers and type Ia supernovae was performed. This comparison against observational tests was used to find best-fit values for the fractional order of the derivative. These methods are a robust scheme for investigating the physical behaviour of cosmological models  \cite{Hernandez-Almada:2020uyr, Leon:2021wyx, Hernandez-Almada:2021rjs, Hernandez-Almada:2021aiw, Garcia-Aspeitia:2022uxz} and can be used in new contexts such as in \cite{Micolta-Riascos:2023mqo}, where dynamical systems and the phase spaces were used to analyze fractional cosmology for different matter contents, obtaining a late-time accelerating cosmology. 

In this paper, we investigate the cosmological applications of power-law solutions of the types $a=(t/t_0)^{\alpha_0}$ in fractional cosmology, where $\alpha_0=t_0 H_0$ is the current age parameter. Additionally, given $\mu$,  the order of the fractional derivative, and $w$, the matter equation of state parameter (EoS), one has to impose two compatibility conditions which give the possible $(\mu, w)$-values that make them particular solutions. Moreover, we are interested in an exact solution that gives the general solution of the system. For this purpose,  one can solve a Riccati Equation independent of the EoS, where the solution for the scale factor is a combination of power-law solutions. This research's main objective is to investigate open problems in gravity and cosmology. 

Undeniably, the late time acceleration in the Universe expansion is one of the most challenging topics in modern cosmology. 

Since 1998, when the independent projects High-z Supernova Search Team \cite{SupernovaSearchTeam:1998fmf} and Supernova Cosmology Project \cite{SupernovaCosmologyProject:1998vns} got the results that suggested this behaviour in the Universe, the type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) data has become in a definitive proof to study this era of the Universe and the transition between the decelerated expansion phase to the accelerated one. However, this last conclusion usually is model-dependent \cite{Moresco:2016mzx}. In this sense, the observational Hubble parameter data (OHD), also known as cosmic chronometers, has become a fundamental data test, complementary to the SNe Ia data, to study the Universe's expansion rate in a model-independent way. Finally, we estimate the free parameters $(\alpha_0, \mu)$ using these cosmological data. 

The paper is organized as follows. Section \ref{Sect:II} discusses the basics of the fractional variational approach to cosmology and presents the cosmological equations for a perfect fluid. In section \ref{Sect:III}, we comment on the crucial difference between fractional and standard cosmology; that is, we obtain late-time acceleration without adding a cosmological constant, quintessence scalar field, or other exotic fluids as compared with standard cosmology. In subsection \ref{Sect:III.1}  we consider a model with cold dark matter to present a specific realization of these possibilities, and we interpret the fractional modification as dark energy in subsection \ref{Sect:III.2}.   Section \ref{Sect:IV} is devoted to finding exact solutions for the Hubble factor in this scenario. They correspond mainly to power-law solutions for the scale factor and a combination of power-law functions. In subsection \ref{Sect:V}, we provide a precise scheme to find approximated analytical solutions helpfully for the asymptotic analysis. See discussion in subsection \ref{Sect:V.1}. We solve Bernoulli's equation using differential inequalities and asymptotic expansions to estimate $H(z)$ in redshift. The physical discussion of the results is presented in subsection \ref{Sect:VIII}. In section \ref{Sect:VII}, a joint analysis using data from OHD and type Ia supernovae is performed. This comparison against observational tests was used to find best-fit values for the fractional order of the derivative and the current age parameter $\alpha_0$. Section \ref{Sect:IX} concludes. 


\section{Fractional action integral}
\label{Sect:II}

Recently, a wide range of definitions of fractional derivatives \citep{Uch:2013}, like the Riemann-Liouville derivative (RLD), and the Caputo derivative (CD), among others, are used in many applications. In particular, the above derivatives are defined by Cauchy’s formula for the integral of non-integer order $\mu>0$, given by
\begin{equation}
{ }_{c} I_{t}^{\mu} f(t)=\Gamma(\mu)^{-1} \int_{c}^{t} f(\tau)(t-\tau)^{\mu-1} d \tau \label{EQ1}.
\end{equation}
In this case, the RLD with $\mu \geq 0$ for $f(t)$ is defined by 
\begin{eqnarray}
D_{t}^{\mu} f(t) &\equiv & \frac{d^n}{dt^n}  \left({ }_{c}I_{t}^{n-\mu} f(t)\right)= \Gamma(n-\mu)^{-1} \frac{d^{n}}{d t^{n}} \int_{c}^{t} \frac{f(\tau)}{(t-\tau)^{\mu-n+1}} d \tau, \label{EQ2}
\end{eqnarray}
where $n=[\mu]+1$ and $\mu \in (n-1,n)$. Notice that the main parameter of fractional calculus is given by $\mu$, recovering standard calculus when $\mu\rightarrow 1$.
The Caputo left derivative is defined as
 \begin{align}
 & { }^{C} D_{t}^{\mu} f(t) \equiv { }_{c} I_{t}^{n-\mu} D_{t}^{n} f(t) =    \Gamma(n-\mu)^{-1} \int_{c}^{t} \frac{\frac{d^{n}}{d \tau^{n}} f(\tau)}{(t-\tau)^{\mu-n+1}} d \tau, 
\end{align}
where $n=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}
     [\mu] +1& \mu \notin \mathbb{N}\\
     \mu &  \mu \in \mathbb{N}
\end{array} \right.$.
In fractional calculus, we now have the following relation (see \citep{Uch:2013}) for the case of more than one derivatives 
\begin{equation}
D_{t}^{\mu} \left[D_{t}^{\beta} f(t)\right]=D_{t}^{\mu+\beta} f(t)-\sum_{j=1}^{n} D_{t}^{\beta-j} f(c+) \frac{(t-c)^{-\mu-j}}{\Gamma(1-\mu-j)},
\end{equation}
or in other words $D_{t}^{\mu} D_{t}^{\beta} f(t) \neq D_{t}^{\mu+\beta} f(t)$, if not all derivatives $D_{t}^{\beta-j} f(c+)$  are equal to zero at $c$. 
Additionally, the fractional derivative of the Leibniz rule \citep{Uch:2013} reads as 
\begin{equation}
D_{t}^{\mu}[f(t) g(t)]=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{\Gamma(\mu+1)}{k ! \Gamma(\mu-k+1)} D_{t}^{\mu-k} f(t) D_{t}^{k} g(t),
\end{equation}
having the usual when $\mu=n\in \mathbb{N}$.


Regarding the classical regime, fractional derivative cosmology has been established by two methods: (i) The last-step modification method is the simplest one, in which the corresponding fractional field equations replace the given cosmological field equations for a specific model. (ii) The first-step modification method can be considered a more fundamental methodology. In this method, one starts by establishing fractional derivative geometry. More concretely, the variational principle for fractional Action is applied to establish a modified cosmological model. 

We need to mention that in \citep{Shchigolev:2010vh} and \citep{ Roberts:2009ix}, the Riemann curvature tensor and the Einstein tensor are defined as usual, but now with dependence on the $\mu$ fractional parameter. Then, it is possible to write down the fractional analogous for the Einstein field equation through the expression $G_{\alpha \beta}(\mu)=8 \pi G T_{\alpha \beta}(\mu)$, where $G_{\alpha \beta}(\mu)$ is the Einstein tensor in fractional calculus, and $G$ is the Newton gravitational constant. These studies correspond to the last-step modification method, as we mentioned before. Modifications to several astrophysical and cosmological events can be studied based on the last equation. For example, a fractional theory of gravitation for fractional spacetime is developed in \citep{Vacaru:2010fb, Vacaru:2010wj}). Non-holonomic deformations to cosmology lead to new classes of cosmological models studied in \citep{Vacaru:2010wn, Shchigolev:2021lbm}. 

Within the first-step modification method, one procedure uses the fractional variational approach developed by  \cite{El-Nabulsi:2005oyu, El-Nabulsi:2007lla, El-Nabulsi:2007wgc, El-Nabulsi:2008oqn, Roberts:2009ix, 10.5555/1466940.1466942}. With the following fractional action integral,
\begin{align}
 S(\tau)
   & = \frac{1}{\Gamma(\mu)}\int_0^\tau \mathcal{L}\left(\theta, q_i(\theta), \dot{q}_i(\theta), \ddot{q}_i(\theta)\right)(\tau-\theta)^{\mu-1} d\theta, \label{GenCFL}
\end{align}
\noindent 
where $\Gamma(\mu)$ is the Gamma function, $\mathcal{L}$ is the Lagrangian, $\mu$ is the constant fractional parameter, and $\tau$ and $ \theta$ are the observers, and intrinsic time, respectively. 

Variation of \eqref{GenCFL} with respect to $q_i$ leads to the Euler--Poisson equations \cite{10.5555/1466940.1466942}:  

  \begin{align}
&   \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}\left(\theta, q_i(\theta), \dot{q}_i(\theta), \ddot{q}_i(\theta)\right)}{\partial q_i}   -\frac{d}{d \theta} \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}\left(\theta, q_i(\theta), \dot{q}_i(\theta), \ddot{q}_i(\theta)\right) }{\partial \dot{q}_i}  + \frac{d^2}{d \theta^2} \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}\left(\theta, q_i(\theta), \dot{q}_i(\theta), \ddot{q}_i(\theta)\right) }{\partial \ddot{q}_i}  \nonumber \\
& =  \frac{1-\mu}{\tau-\theta} \left(\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}\left(\theta, q_i(\theta), \dot{q}_i(\theta), \ddot{q}_i(\theta)\right)}{\partial \dot{q}_i}   -2 \frac{d}{d \theta} \frac{\partial  \mathcal{L}\left(\theta, q_i(\theta), \dot{q}_i(\theta), \ddot{q}_i(\theta)\right)}{\partial \ddot{q}_i} \right)  \nonumber \\
& - \frac{\left(1-\mu\right)\left(2-\mu\right)}{\left(\tau-\theta\right)^2} \frac{\partial  \mathcal{L}\left(\theta, q_i(\theta), \dot{q}_i(\theta), \ddot{q}_i(\theta)\right)}{\partial \ddot{q}_i}. \label{EP}
 \end{align}


In cosmology, it is assumed that the flat Friedmann provides the geometry of spacetime--Lema\^{i}tre--Robertson--Walker (FLRW) metric: 
\begin{equation}
  ds^2=-N^2 (t) dt^2+ a^2(t)(dx^2+ dy^2+dz^2),  \label{FLRWm}
\end{equation}
where  $a(t)$ denotes the scale factor.
This result is based on Planck's observations \cite{Planck:2018vyg}.

For the metric \eqref{FLRWm}, the Ricci' scalar reads
\begin{equation}
R(t)=    6\Bigg(\frac{\ddot{a}(t)}{a(t) N^2(t)} +\frac{{\dot{a}}^2(t)}{a^2(t) N^2(t)}-\frac{\dot{a}(t) \dot{N}(t)}{a(t) N^3(t)}\Bigg). \label{Rscalar}
\end{equation}

Consider the point-like Action  integral 
\begin{align}
 S (\tau)  = \int_0^\tau \left[\frac{R(\theta)}{2}+ {L}(\theta)\right] a^3(\theta) N(\theta) d\theta, \label{CFL0}
\end{align}
where $R(\theta)$ is the Ricci' scalar \eqref{Rscalar}. 
For simplicity, we consider units in which $ 8\pi G=c=1$ and assume a perfect fluid for the matter content of the Universe
where ${L}(\theta)=-\rho_{0} a(\theta)^{-3(1+w)}$, for $w\neq -1$ is the usual matter Lagrangian of a perfect fluid as in
\cite{Wald, Carroll, carroll2004spacetime} and contains integer-order derivatives in the Lagrangian. We consider the transition to the effective fractional Action  used in  \cite{Garcia-Aspeitia:2022uxz}, say
\begin{align}
 S_{{\text{eff}}} (\tau)
   & = \frac{1}{\Gamma(\mu)}\int_0^\tau \Bigg[\frac{R(\theta)}{2}  +\mathcal{L}(\tau, \theta)\Bigg](\tau-\theta)^{\mu-1} a^3(\theta) N(\theta) d\theta, \label{CFL}
\end{align}
\noindent
where $\Gamma(\mu)$ is the Gamma function, $\mathcal{L}(\tau, \theta)={L}(\theta) (\tau -\theta )^{-(\mu -1) (w+1)}$, which recovers the usual matter Lagrangian of a perfect fluid as $\mu\rightarrow 1$ 
\cite{Wald, Carroll, carroll2004spacetime}, $\mu$ is the constant fractional parameter, and $\tau$ and $ \theta$ are the observers and intrinsic time, respectively \cite{Shchigolev:2010vh}, $w=p/\rho$ is a constant EoS for matter. For a fixed $\tau$, the expressions
\begin{equation}
    \rho(\theta)=\rho_{0} a(\theta )^{-3(1+w)} (\tau -\theta )^{-(\mu -1) (w+1)}, \label{rho(theta-tau)}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
p(\theta)=w \rho_{0} a(\theta )^{-3(1+w)} (\tau -\theta )^{-(\mu -1) (w+1)}, \label{p(theta-tau)}
\end{equation} 
defines the energy density and the isotropic pressure of the matter fields. Then, 

\begin{align}
  & \dot{\rho}(\theta)=\frac{d}{d\theta}\left[\rho_{0} a(\theta)^{-3(1+w)}(\tau -\theta )^{-(\mu -1) (w+1)}\right]=(w+1) \rho(\theta ) \left(-\frac{3 \dot{a}(\theta )}{a(\theta )}-\frac{\mu -1}{\theta
   -\tau }\right)\nonumber\\
  & = -3 \left(\frac{ \dot{a}(\theta)}{a(\theta )}+\frac{1-\mu}{3(\tau-\theta)}\right) (\rho(\theta)+p(\theta)).\label{cons}
\end{align}


Defining $q_i\in \{N, a \}$  in \eqref{GenCFL} and for fixed $\tau$ we have the Lagrangian

\begin{align}
 & \mathcal{L}\left(\theta, N(\theta), \dot{N}(\theta), a(\theta), \dot{a}(\theta), \ddot{a}(\theta)\right):=  \nonumber \\
 & \frac{3 a(\theta ) \left(N(\theta ) \left(a(\theta ) \ddot{a}(\theta )+\dot{a}^2(\theta
   )\right)-a(\theta ) \dot{a}(\theta ) \dot{N}(\theta )\right)}{ N^2(\theta )}- \rho_{0} N(\theta ) a(\theta )^{-3 w} (\tau -\theta )^{-(\mu -1) (w+1)}.
\end{align}



The Euler--Poisson Equations \eqref{EP} obtained after varying the action \eqref{CFL} for $q_i\in \{N, a \}$ lead to the field equations 

\begin{align}
&\left(\frac{\dot{a}(\theta )}{a(\theta )}\right)^2 + \frac{(1-\mu)}{(\tau-\theta )} \frac{\dot{a}(\theta )}{a(\theta )}= \frac{1}{3}\rho_{0} a(\theta )^{-3(1+w)} (\tau -\theta )^{-(\mu -1) (w+1)}, \label{FEQ1}
\\
& \frac{\ddot{a}(\theta )}{a(\theta )}+\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\dot{a}(\theta )}{a(\theta )}\right)^2+ \frac{(1-\mu)}{(t-\theta )} \frac{\dot{a}(\theta )}{a(\theta )}+\frac{(\mu -2) (\mu -1)}{2 (\tau-\theta )^2}=-\frac{1}{2} \rho_{0} w a(\theta )^{-3(1+w)}
   (\tau -\theta )^{-(\mu -1) (w+1)}. \label{REQ1}
\end{align}

\noindent
Here, we have substituted the lapse function $N=1$ after the variation. 




To designate the temporary independent variables, the rule $(\tau, \theta) \mapsto (2t,t)$ is applied, where new cosmological time $t$ \cite{Shchigolev:2010vh} is used, where the dots denote these derivatives. Furthermore, the Hubble parameter is $H\equiv\dot{a}/a$. Hence, Equations \eqref{FEQ1} and \eqref{REQ1} and the conservation equation \eqref{cons} can be written as 

\begin{align}
& \dot{H}(t)+\frac{(1-\mu ) H(t)}{t}+\frac{3 H(t)^2}{2}+\frac{(\mu -2)
   (\mu -1)}{2 t^2}=-\frac{1}{2}  p(t) \label{Raych1},\\
& H(t)^2+\frac{(1-\mu ) H(t)}{t}= \frac{1}{3} \rho (t), \label{Fried1}\\
& \dot{\rho}(t)= -3 \left(H(t) +\frac{(1-\mu)}{3 t}\right)(p(t)+ \rho(t)). \label{Cons} 
\end{align}
where expressions \eqref{rho(theta-tau)} and 
\eqref{p(theta-tau)} are transformed to 
\begin{equation}
    \rho(t)=\rho_{0} \left[a(t )^{-3} t^{-(\mu -1)}\right]^{1+w}, \;\text{and}\;
p(t)=w \rho_{0}  \left[a(t )^{-3} t^{-(\mu -1)}\right]^{1+w},
\end{equation} 
defines the energy density and the isotropic pressure of the matter fields in cosmological time. 



\section{Fractional cosmology}
\label{Sect:III}

From  \eqref{Fried1} and assuming $p=0 \; \left( w =0\right) $, the Hubble parameter is 
\begin{equation}
H\left( t\right) =\frac{\mu -1}{2t}\left[ 1+\sqrt{1+\frac{4}{3}\rho \left(
t\right) \left( \frac{t}{\mu -1}\right) ^{2}}\right],  \label{IVA}
\end{equation}%
We have considered the positive root because we are interested in expanding universes. 

To understand the self-accelerating behaviour of $H$, let us assume that there is no matter, say, $\rho=0$, and $\mu>1$. Then, from \eqref{f1}, 
\begin{equation}
H\left( t\right) =\frac{\mu -1}{t}\implies a\left( t\right) =\left( 
\frac{t}{t_{0}}\right) ^{\mu -1},\label{3}
\end{equation}%

Henceforth, 
\begin{equation}
H\left( t\rightarrow \infty \right) \rightarrow 0, \quad %
a\left( t\rightarrow \infty \right) \rightarrow \infty,  \quad  \text{if}\; \mu >1.  \label{4}
\end{equation}%
and the deceleration parameter can be expressed as $1+q=-\dot{H}/H^{2}$. Therefore, 
\begin{align}
q & = -1+\frac{1}{\mu -1},  \label{5} \\
\; \text{and}\;\mu &> 1\Longrightarrow q>-1,  \label{6}
\end{align}%
where the usual case $q=-1$, corresponding to a cosmological constant $\Lambda$ is excluded.

The case $\rho=0$ can also be interpreted as a fluid whose energy density
quickly vanishes with evolution. The asymptotic solution \eqref{3} was 
examined in detail using dynamical systems analysis in reference \cite{Garcia-Aspeitia:2022uxz}, and its properties are summarized in Table \ref{Tab2}.
That is the asymptotic behaviour for $\mu>1$ when the energy density of matter tends to zero. Hence, even in the absence of matter, fractional cosmology gives a power-law solution $a(t)= \left(t/t_0\right)^{\mu-1}$, which is accelerated for $\mu>2$. That is a crucial difference compared with standard cosmology, where we must add a cosmological constant, quintessence scalar field, or other exotic fluids to accelerate the expansion.

\end{table}

Solving algebraically Equations \eqref{Raych1}, \eqref{Fried1} and \eqref{Cons} for $\dot{H}$, $\dot{\rho}$ and $\rho$, we obtain 
\begin{align}
   & \dot{H} = -\frac{1}{2} p+\frac{(\mu -1) H}{t}-\frac{3}{2} H^2-\frac{(\mu
   -2) (\mu -1)}{2 t^2}, \label{NewRaych}\\
   & \dot{\rho}= -\frac{3 (\mu -1)^2 H }{ t^2}+\frac{12
   (\mu -1) H ^2}{t}- 9 H ^3 +p \left(\frac{\mu -1}{t}-3 H\right), \label{NewCons}\\
   & \rho= 3 H^2-\frac{3 (\mu -1) H}{ t}. \label{NewFried}
\end{align}

Compared with General Relativity (GR), in GR, we have the flat Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker metric; the main equations are the 
Friedmann constraint and conservation equation, respectively, 
\begin{align}
3H^{2} & = \rho, \label{a} \\
\dot{\rho}+3H\left( \rho +p\right)& = 0.  \label{b}
\end{align}%
Using  \eqref{a} and \eqref{b}
we obtain 
\begin{align}
2\dot{H}=-\left( \rho +p\right).%
  \label{d}
\end{align}%
Now, using \eqref{a} and \eqref{d} 
we re-obtain \eqref{b}. That is, we have three equations, two of them independent. 
However, as we discussed before, in \cite{Micolta-Riascos:2023mqo} studied the equations \eqref{Raych1}, \eqref{Fried1} and \eqref{Cons}, and using a similar procedure as in GR, we obtain a new equation (see Eq. \eqref{NewP}) instead of showing that two out of three equations are independent.


 By demanding that \eqref{Fried1} is conserved in time, say  
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d}{d t} \left[H(t)^2+\frac{(1-\mu ) H(t)}{t}-  \frac{1}{3}\rho (t)\right]=0,
\end{equation}
we calculate de corresponding derivatives and substitute \eqref{NewRaych}, \eqref{NewCons} and \eqref{NewFried} to obtain 
\begin{equation}
    \frac{(\mu -1) (t ( t p-3 H (t H+2 \mu -6))+3 (\mu -2) (\mu -1))}{6t^3}=0.
\end{equation}
This equation is an identity for $\mu=1$ as expected in standard cosmology. However, for $\mu\neq 1$, we acquire the new relation for the pressure of the fluid, say 
\begin{equation}
   p(t) = \frac{6 (\mu -3) H(t)}{t}+3 H^2(t)-\frac{3 (\mu -2)(\mu -1)}{ t^2}. \label{NewP}
\end{equation}
Using a similar procedure as in GR, we obtain a new equation \eqref{NewP} instead of showing that two out of three equations are independent. This characteristic of fractional cosmology leads to some restrictions of the matter fields in the Universe that were explored in \cite{Micolta-Riascos:2023mqo} for different matter fields.

Replacing the expression of $p$ defined by \eqref{NewP} in \eqref{NewRaych} and \eqref{NewCons}, we obtain 
\begin{align}
    & \dot{H}= -\frac{2 (\mu -4) H}{t}-3 H^2+\frac{(\mu -2) (\mu -1)}{t^2}, \label{Riccati}\\
    & \dot{\rho}= \frac{3 (\mu -1) (4 \mu -11) H}{ t^2}-\frac{3 (\mu -13) H^2}{t}-18 H^3 -\frac{3 (\mu -2) (\mu -1)^2}{ t^3}.
\end{align}
The previous results are valid for any ideal gas source. 

 

On the other hand, comparing with other fractional formulations, according to \cite{Shchigolev:2013jq, Shchigolev:2015rei}, and assuming $\Lambda=0$ and using units where $8\pi G \Gamma(\mu) = 1$ for simplicity, we obtain the field equations
\begin{align}
& 2\dot{H}+3H^{2}+2\frac{\left( 1-\mu \right) }{t}H+\frac{\left( 1-\mu \right)
\left( 2-\mu \right) }{t^{2}}  = -t^{1-\mu } P,   \label{f2}\\ 
& 3H^{2}+3\left( 1-\mu \right) \frac{H}{t} = t^{1-\mu }\varrho,  \label{f1} \\
& \dot{\varrho}+3H\left(\varrho + P\right)= 0, \label{f3}
\end{align}%
$\varrho$ and $P$ are the bare dark matter energy density and pressure.
Equations \eqref{f2}, \eqref{f1} and \eqref{f3} are equivalent to \eqref{Raych1}, \eqref{Fried1} and \eqref{Cons}, under the scaling 
\begin{equation}
(\rho,  p)= t^{1-\mu } (\varrho, P).
\end{equation}
Now we consider a constant EoS,  
\begin{equation}
 P=w \varrho. 
 \end{equation}
Then, one obtains, 
\begin{equation}
w =-1+\frac{2}{3}\left[ \left( 1+q(t)\right) -\frac{\left(
\mu -1\right) }{2tH}-\frac{\left( \mu -1\right) \left( \mu -2\right) }{%
2\left( tH\right) ^{2}}\right] \left( 1-\frac{\mu -1}{tH}\right) ^{-1}. 
\label{f4}
\end{equation}%
Then, for $\mu =1$ we have 
\begin{align}
3H^{2}& = \rho, \label{f5} \\
2\dot{H} +3H^{2}& =  -p \implies 2\dot{H}=-\left( \rho +p\right),  \label{f6} 
\end{align}
and 
\begin{align}
q=\frac{1}{2}\left[ 1+3\left( \frac{p}{\rho }\right) \right] =\frac{1}{2}\left( 1+3w \right) \implies  w =\frac{1}{3}\left( 2q-1\right). 
\label{f7}
\end{align}%
Furthermore, we recover GR.

From \eqref{f1} and \eqref{f2}, and $\mu\neq 1$, it follows 
\begin{equation}
2\dot{H}-\frac{\left( 1-\mu \right) }{t}H+\frac{\left( 1-\mu \right) \left(
2-\mu \right) }{t^{2}}=-t^{1-\mu }\left( 1+w \right) \varrho.  \label{f8}
\end{equation}%
Replacing \eqref{f1}, we recover \eqref{f4}.

Setting  $%
w =0$, from \eqref{f4} we obtain 
\begin{align}
q\left( t\right)  & = \frac{1}{2}+\left( \frac{\mu -1}{tH}\right) \left( 
\frac{\left( \mu /2-1\right) }{tH}-1\right).   \label{f9}
\end{align}%
That is, a ``correction''  to the usual {\text{CDM}} ($\mu=1$, $w =0$, $q=1/2$).

Using \eqref{f9}, and the relation $q=-1-\dot{H}/H^2$, we obtain the equation for $H$ is 
\begin{equation}
\dot{H}=\frac{(\mu -1) H}{t}-\frac{3}{2} H^2-\frac{(\mu -2) (\mu -1)}{2 t^2}.  \label{f11}
\end{equation}

For $\mu=1$ we recover the usual {\text{CDM}} ($w =0$, $q=1/2$),
\begin{equation}
    H(t)= \frac{2 H_0}{3 H_0 (t-t_0) +2}, \; q= \frac{1}{2}.
\end{equation}

For $\mu=2$, the solution of \eqref{f11} is 
\begin{equation}
 H(t)=   \frac{4 H_0 t}{3 H_0 (t-t_0) (t+t_0)+4 t_0}, \; q=\frac{1}{2}- \frac{1}{t H}= -\frac{1}{4} -\frac{t_0}{H_0 t^2}+\frac{3 t_0^2}{4 t^2}.
\end{equation}


Another case of interest is $w =-1$ (quasi-vacuum matter, according to \cite{Shchigolev:2013jq, Shchigolev:2015rei}). 

The equation for $H$ becomes
\begin{equation}
   \dot{H}=-\frac{(\mu -1) H}{2 t}-\frac{(\mu -2) (\mu -1)}{2 t^2}.
\end{equation}

The solution to $H\left( t\right) $ turns out to be
\begin{equation}
H\left( t\right) =H_0 \left(\frac{t}{t_0}\right)^{-\frac{\mu-1}{2}}+ \frac{(\mu -2) (\mu -1)}{(3-\mu) t}\left[1-  \left(\frac{t}{t_0}\right)^{\frac{3-\mu }{2}}\right],  \label{f16}
\end{equation}%
According to \eqref{f16}, 
\begin{small}
\begin{align}
q\left( t\right) & =-1 \nonumber \\& +\left[{\frac{H_0 (\mu -1) \left(\frac{t}{t_0}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}-\frac{\mu }{2}}}{2 t}- \frac{(\mu -2)
   (\mu -1) \left(1-\left(\frac{t}{t_0}\right)^{\frac{3}{2}-\frac{\mu }{2}}\right)}{(\mu -3) t^2}+\frac{(\mu
   -2) (\mu -1) \left(\frac{t}{t_0}\right)^{-\frac{\mu }{2}-\frac{1}{2}}}{2 t_0^2}}\right] H(t)^{-2},  \label{f17}
\end{align}%
\end{small}
For $0<\mu<3$, we have 
\begin{equation}
q\left( t\rightarrow \infty \right) \rightarrow -1.  \label{f18}
\end{equation} 
Hence, we obtain a late-time de Sitter solution without including a cosmological constant. 

Summarizing, fractional cosmology allows for an accelerated expansion without adding exotic fluids to the model. Therefore, we now consider a model with cold dark matter to present a specific realization of these possibilities.  

\subsection{Model with cold dark matter}
\label{Sect:III.1}
Assume 
\begin{equation}
    H\left( t\right) =\frac{\alpha}{t},\label{12}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ is a constant and $\mu>1$ and if $\alpha=\mu-1$ we recover Equation \eqref{3}. 

The conservation equation for the matter \eqref{Cons}, for cold dark matter ($p_{\text{CDM}}=w_{\text{CDM}}\rho _{\text{CDM}}$ and $w_{\text{DM}}=0$), which takes the form
\begin{equation}
\dot{\rho}_{\text{CDM}}+3H\left( 1+\frac{1-\mu }{3Ht}\right) \rho_{\text{CDM}}=0,\label{8}
\end{equation}%
reduces to 
\begin{equation}
\dot{\rho}_{\text{CDM}} +  \frac{(3 \alpha -\mu +1) {\rho}_{\text{CDM}}}{t}=0
\end{equation}
Hence, we have for the matter-energy density,  
\begin{align}
\rho _{\text{CDM}} & = \rho_{CDM\left( 0\right) }(t/t_0)^{^{-3 \alpha +\mu -1}}.
\end{align}% 
Choosing 
\begin{equation}
 \alpha = \frac{\mu +1}{3}, \label{zeta}
\end{equation}
we obtain 
\begin{equation}
\rho _{\text{CDM}}  = \rho_{CDM\left( 0\right) }(t/t_0)^{-2}.
\end{equation}
Then, from Eq. \eqref{NewFried} we obtain 
\begin{align}
\rho_{CDM\left( 0\right) }= \frac{2 (2-\mu) (\mu +1)}{3 t_0^2}. \label{13}
\end{align}% 
Using the  redshift parameter  $1+z=1/a$, we obtain 
\begin{align}
H\left( t\right) & = \frac{\alpha}{t}\implies  a\left(
t\right) =\left( \frac{t}{t_{0}}\right) ^{\alpha},  \label{17} \\
\; \text{and}\;1+z & = \frac{1}{a}\Longrightarrow \left( \frac{t}{t_{0}}%
\right)=\left( 1+z\right) ^{-\frac{1}{\alpha}},  \label{18}
\end{align}%
then, 
\begin{equation}
\rho _{\text{CDM}}\left( z\right) =\rho _{\text{CDM}}\left( 0\right) \left(
1+z\right) ^{\frac{2}{\alpha}}\; \text{and}\; H\left( z\right)
=H_0 \left( 1+z\right) ^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}, 
\label{19}
\end{equation}%
where $\alpha$ is defined by \eqref{zeta}. 
Comparing with GR, where the EoS $w_{\text{eff}}$ is defined through
\begin{equation}
\rho _{\text{CDM}}\left( z\right) =\rho _{\text{CDM}}\left( 0\right)  (1+z)^{3(1+w_{\text{eff}})},\label{20}
\end{equation}%
we have
\begin{equation}
w_{\text{eff}} =  -1 + \frac{2}{3 \alpha}= -1+\frac{2}{\mu +1} \; \text{and}\; 
q  = -1+\frac{1}{\alpha}= -1+\frac{3}{\mu +1}. \label{18c}
\end{equation}%
Similarly to GR, we have the usual relation   $q= \frac{1}{2} \left(1 + 3 w_{\text{eff}}\right)$. 
Therefore, in fractional cosmology, we  have acceleration ($\ddot{a}>0, q<0$) as in GR when the effective fluid has $w_{\text{eff}}<-1/3$. 
Hence 
\begin{equation}
\ddot{a}\left( t\right) <0, q>0, w_{\text{eff}}>-1/3 \Longleftrightarrow 1< \mu<2,  \label{19b}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\ddot{a}\left( t\right) > 0, q<0, w_{\text{eff}}<-1/3 \Longleftrightarrow \mu >2. \label{19c}
\end{equation}
Finally, we have an accelerated expansion if $\mu >2$, caused by the fractional derivative correction and not by the matter content. That is the more powerful advantage of fractional cosmology over GR. This is consistent as $\rho _{\text{CDM}}\rightarrow 0$ with the asymptotic solution $H(t)=\frac{\mu -1}{t}$, with  $q=-\frac{\mu -2}{\mu -1}$ that is a Power-law solution  $a(t)= \left(t/t_0\right)^{\mu-1}$. It is accelerated if $\mu>2$ and decelerated if $1<\mu <2$ as proved in \cite{Garcia-Aspeitia:2022uxz}. 


\subsection{Interpretation of the fractional term as a dark energy source}
\label{Sect:III.2}
We write  \eqref{Fried1} as 
\begin{align}
& 3H^{2} = \rho _{\text{CDM}}+\rho _{\text{frac}},  \label{23} \\
& \; \text{where}\; \rho _{\text{CDM}}\left( z\right) =\rho _{\text{CDM}}\left( 0\right) \left(
1+z\right) ^{\frac{2}{\alpha}}= \frac{2 (2-\mu) (\mu +1)}{3 t_0^2}  \left(
1+z\right) ^{\frac{6}{1+\mu}}, \\
& \; \text{where}\;\rho _{\text{frac}}\left( t\right) = \frac{3\left( \mu -1\right) }{t%
}H \underbrace{\implies}_{\text{using}\; \eqref{12}\; \text{and} \; \eqref{18}} \rho _{\text{frac}}\left( z\right) =\rho _{\text{frac}}\left( 0\right)
\left( 1+z\right) ^{\frac{2}{\alpha }},  \label{24} \\
& \; \text{and}\;\rho _{\text{frac}}\left( 0\right) = \frac{3\left( \mu -1\right) }{%
t_{0}}H_{0}=\frac{\left( \mu -1\right) }{t_{0}H_{0}}3H_{0}^{2},   \label{25}
\end{align}
Using  $H=d\ln a/dt$ y $1+z=1/a$, we obtain 
\begin{equation}
t_{0}H_{0}=\int_{0}^{\infty }\frac{dz}{\left( 1+z\right) E\left( z\right) }.
\label{41}
\end{equation}
Substituting (see equation \eqref{12})
\begin{equation}
E\left( z\right) =\left( 1+z\right) ^{\frac{1}{\alpha }}= \left( 1+z\right) ^{\frac{3}{1+\mu}}, 
\label{42}
\end{equation}
with $\alpha$ defined by \eqref{zeta}, 
we obtain 
\begin{equation}
H_0t_0=(1+\mu)/3. \label{H0t0mu}
\end{equation}


On the other hand, using \eqref{23}, \eqref{24} and \eqref{25}, we obtain 
\begin{align}
& E^{2}\left( z\right)  = \frac{3H^{2}\left( z\right) }{3H_{0}^{2}}=\frac{\rho
_{\text{CDM}}\left( z\right) }{3H_{0}^{2}}+\frac{\rho _{\text{frac}}\left( z\right) }{%
3H_{0}^{2}}\Longleftrightarrow E^{2}\left( z\right) =\Omega _{\text{DM}}\left(
z\right) +\Omega _{\text{frac}}\left( z\right),   \label{26} \\
& \implies \Omega _{\text{frac}}\left( 0\right) =1-\Omega _{\text{DM}}\left( 0\right) =%
\frac{\mu -1}{t_{0}H_{0}}= \frac{3(\mu -1)}{\mu+1}\sim 0.744\%, \;  \mu \sim 1.65957,  \label{28}
\end{align}%
where $\Omega_{\text{DM}}\left( 0\right) \sim 0.256\%$. Compare the value $\mu\sim 1.66$, with the observational tests performed in \cite{Garcia-Aspeitia:2022uxz} for a flat prior $1< \mu<3$, where the best-fit value for $\mu$ is $\mu^*= 1.71$. 
 

We inspect more the nature of $\rho _{\text{frac}}$ as an effective fluid in GR, say 
\begin{align}
\rho _{\text{frac}} & = \frac{3\left( \mu -1\right) }{t}H,\; q= -1-\frac{\dot{H}}{H^2}
\implies  \dot{\rho}_{\text{frac}} =-H\left( 1+q+\frac{1}{Ht}\right) \rho _{\text{frac}},  \label{32} \\
&\implies \dot{\rho}_{\text{frac}}+3H\left( 1+w _{\text{frac}}\right) \rho
_{\text{frac}}=0,  \label{33}
\end{align}%
where $w_{\text{frac}} = \frac{1}{3}\left(q-2+\frac{1}{\alpha}\right)$. According to \eqref{18c}, we deduce again \eqref{20}, 
\begin{align}
w_{\text{frac}} & = -1+\frac{2}{3\alpha },  \label{36}
\end{align}%
corresponding to quintessence ($-1<w_{\text{frac}}<-1/3$) if $\mu >2$. 


\section{Exact solutions}
\label{Sect:IV}

\subsection{First exact solution}

From Equations \eqref{NewFried} and \eqref{NewP}, 
and defining the effective equation of state $ w:= {p}/{\rho}$, we have 
\begin{equation}
    w= \frac{\mu -2}{t H}+\frac{2 \mu -5}{t H-\mu +1}. \label{First_Eq_H}
\end{equation}
Assuming $w\neq -1$ a constant, and by solving \eqref{First_Eq_H} algebraically for $H$ we obtain 
\begin{align}
& H_{1,2}(t) = \frac{\alpha_\pm}{t}, \label{solH-1}\\
& \alpha_\pm ={-\frac{6-2 \mu +(1-\mu)w \pm  \sqrt{\mu ^2 \left(w^2+8\right)+w^2-2 \mu  (w (w+2)+18)+4 w+44}}{2 (w-1)}}. \label{apm-1} 
\end{align}

Hence, in the interval $-1<w<1, 1<\mu <2$ both $H_{1,2}(t)$ are non-negative. For  $-1<w<1, \mu>2$, $H_1(t)$ is negative and $H_2(t)$ is positive. For $\mu\in\{1,2\}$, $H_1(t)$ is zero. 

The deceleration parameter for each algebraic solution is a constant
\begin{align}
& q_{1,2}(t):= -1-{\dot{H_{1,2}}(t)}/{H_{1,2}^2(t)}=-1+ {1}/{\alpha_\pm},
\end{align}
such that the solutions for the scale factor are power-law. 

Therefore, from physical considerations, we select the one that gives an accelerated Universe. The deceleration parameter $q_1(t)$ is negative in the parameter region $-1<w<1, 1<\mu <2$, and we have an accelerated expansion when $H(t)=H_1(t)$ and $(\mu,w) \in [-1,1] \times[1, 2]$. If we choose the range $-1<w<1, 2<\mu<3$, the solution $H_1(t)$ becomes nonphysical, and the one that gives accelerated expansion is $H_2(t)$ because $q_2(t)$ is negative in the parameter region $-1<w<1, 2<\mu <3$. 


Substituting \eqref{solH-1}, \eqref{NewFried} and \eqref{NewP} in \eqref{NewRaych} and \eqref{NewCons}, we obtain the compatibility conditions
\begin{align}
   & -2 \alpha_\pm  \mu -3 (\alpha_\pm -3) \alpha_\pm +\mu ^2-3 \mu +2=0, \label{compatibility_1}\\
   &(2 \alpha_\pm -\mu +1) \left(2
   \alpha_\pm  \mu +3 (\alpha_\pm -3) \alpha_\pm -\mu ^2+3 \mu -2\right)=0. \label{compatibility_2}
\end{align}
where $\alpha_\pm$ is defined by \eqref{apm-1}, for the existence of an exact solution. 
We define the current value of $H(t_0)=H_0$ through $H_0 t_0 =\alpha_\pm$, and $\alpha_\pm$  is interpreted as the age parameter $\alpha= t H$ evaluated at $t_0$ (the current time). 

Therefore, to obtain solutions, we solve \eqref{compatibility_1}
and \eqref{compatibility_2} simultaneously for $\mu$ and $w$. From physical considerations we remove the cases with $w=-1$ and $\mu \in\{1,2\}$, and we assume $-1<w<1$. 

From \eqref{solH-1}, the definition of $q$, equations \eqref{NewFried}, \eqref{NewP}, and \eqref{First_Eq_H}, we have  
\begin{align*}
& a(t)= \left(\frac{t}{t_0}\right)^{\alpha_\pm}, \quad H(t)= \frac{\alpha_{\pm}}{t}, \quad  q(t)=-1+ \frac{1}{\alpha_{\pm}},\\
& p(t)= \frac{3 \left(\alpha_\pm^2+2 \alpha_\pm (\mu -3)-(\mu -2) (\mu -1)\right)}{ t^2}, \quad  \rho(t)= \frac{3 \alpha_\pm (1-\mu+\alpha_\pm )}{ t^2}, 
\end{align*} and 
\begin{align}
& w:= {p(t)}/{\rho(t)}=\frac{\mu }{\alpha_{\pm}}
+\frac{2 \alpha_{\pm}-3}{1-\mu+\alpha_{\pm}}-\frac{\alpha_{\pm}+2}{\alpha_{\pm}}, \label{alpha_w}
\end{align}
where we set the conditions  $a'(t_0)=H_0, a(t_0)=1,$ where we have fixed the value $a=1$ today. 

For simplicity, let us assume that the source is dust, with $p=0$ ($w=0$). 
Then, we have $\alpha_\pm= 3-\mu +\epsilon\sqrt{\mu  (2 \mu -9)+11}$ where $\epsilon=\pm 1$, that makes \eqref{alpha_w} an identity. 

Hence, we have 
\begin{align}
&  H_{1,2} (t)= \frac{3-\mu +\epsilon\sqrt{\mu  (2 \mu -9)+11} }{t},  \\
& \rho(t)=\frac{3 \left(\mu - \epsilon\sqrt{\mu  (2 \mu -9)+11} -3\right) \left(2 \mu
   -\epsilon\sqrt{\mu  (2 \mu -9)+11}  -4\right)}{ t^2}.
\end{align}
Substituting in \eqref{NewRaych} and \eqref{NewCons}
we obtain the compatibility conditions (replace $w=0$ in \eqref{compatibility_1}
and \eqref{compatibility_2}), 
\begin{align}
  & -3 (\mu  (2 \mu -9)+11)+\sqrt{\mu  (2 \mu -9)+11} (4 \mu -9) \epsilon +2=0,\\
  & -(17 \mu -39)
   (\mu  (2 \mu -9)+11)+6 \mu +6 (\mu  (2 \mu -9)+11)^{3/2} \epsilon \nonumber \\
   & +(\mu  (12 \mu -55)+59)
   \sqrt{\mu  (2 \mu -9)+11} \epsilon -14=0.
\end{align}
\noindent For the choice $\epsilon=-1$, the two conditions are simultaneously satisfied only for $\mu\in\{1,2\}$. 

\noindent For the choice $\epsilon=1$, the two conditions are simultaneously satisfied only for $\mu\in\{5/2, 7/2\}$. Since we are interested in the case  $\mu\notin\{1,2\}$ and in expanding Universe ($H>0$), the parameter that gives the physical solution $H(t)=H_2(t)$ is $\mu=5/2$. Substituting this values for $w$ and $\mu$ we obtain 
\begin{equation}
\left( p(t),  \rho(t), H(t)\right)  \rightarrow \left(0,0,\frac{3}{2 t}\right) \implies a(t)= a_0 t^{3/2}.
\end{equation}

That means if we fix the equation of state $w$, there are specific values that $\mu$ has to satisfy to obtain an exact solution. 


\subsection{Second exact solution}

One can also solve for $\mu\neq 1$ a Riccati equation 
\begin{align}
    \dot{H}(t)=\frac{(\mu -1) (3 w+2) H(t)}{2 t}-\frac{3}{2} (w+1) H(t)^2-\frac{(\mu -2) (\mu -1)}{2
   t^2} \label{Rccati2}
\end{align}
which follows from substitution $p=w \rho$ in \eqref{NewRaych} and removing $\rho$ using \eqref{NewFried}. 
We obtain the exact solution
\begin{align}
& H(t)= \frac{1}{3 t (w+1)}    \Bigg[\mu+\beta+\frac{3}{2} (\mu -1) w -\frac{2 b_1  t_0^{\beta } \beta}{t^\beta+b_1 t_0^{\beta } }\Bigg], \label{exactRicatti2}
    \end{align}
where 
\begin{equation}
    b_1=  \frac{2 (\beta +\mu )-6 H_0 t_0 (w+1)+3 (\mu -1) w}{2 \beta +6 H_0 t_0 (w+1)-2 \mu -3 \mu  w+3 w},
\end{equation} is an integration constant, where $H_0$ is the current value of $H$ at $t=t_0$, and 
\begin{equation}
\beta=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{-4 (\mu  (2 \mu -9)+6)+9 (\mu -1)^2 w^2+24 (\mu -1) w}.
\end{equation}
Substituting in \eqref{NewRaych} and \eqref{NewCons}
we obtain the compatibility conditions
\begin{small}
\begin{align}
& -4 \beta  (\beta -4 \mu +9)+\frac{8 \beta ^2 (w-1) t^{2 \beta
   }}{\left(t^{\beta }+b_1 t_0^{\beta }\right){}^2}-3 (\mu -1) (3 \mu -13) w^2  +w \left(4\beta  (5 \mu -12)-8 \mu ^2+42 \mu -6\right)  +24  \nonumber \\
   & -\frac{8 \beta  t^{\beta } (-\beta +4 \mu +w (\beta +5 \mu-12)-9)}{t^{\beta }+b_1 t_0^{\beta}}=0,
\\
   &t^{2 \beta } \left(4 \beta  (\beta
   +4 \mu -9)+3 (\mu -1) (3 \mu -13) w^2+w \left(4 \beta  (5 \mu -12)+8 \mu ^2-42 \mu
   +6\right)-24\right) \nonumber \\
   & +2 b_1 t^{\beta } t_0^{\beta } \left(w \left(4 \beta ^2+\mu ^2 (9
   w+8)-6 \mu  (8 w+7)+39 w+6\right)-24\right) \nonumber \\
   & +b_1{}^2 t_0^{2 \beta } \left(4 \beta 
   (\beta -4 \mu +9)+3 (\mu -1) (3 \mu -13) w^2+w \left(\beta  (48-20 \mu )+8 \mu ^2-42 \mu
   +6\right)-24\right)=0.
   \end{align}
  \end{small} 
These compatibility conditions have to be satisfied for all $t$, such that $b_1=0$, \eqref{exactRicatti2} becomes \begin{align}
& H(t)= \frac{1}{3 t (w+1)}    \Bigg[\mu+\beta+\frac{3}{2} (\mu -1) w\Bigg], \label{exactRicatti22}
    \end{align}
and the compatibility conditions are 

\begin{align}
   & -4 \beta  (\beta +4 \mu -9)-3 (\mu -1) (3 \mu -13) w^2+w \left(\beta  (48-20 \mu )-8
   \mu ^2+42 \mu -6\right)+24=0, \label{compatibility_21}\\
   &4 \beta  (\beta +4 \mu -9)+3 (\mu -1)
   (3 \mu -13) w^2+w \left(4 \beta  (5 \mu -12)+8 \mu ^2-42 \mu +6\right)-24=0. \label{compatibility_22}
\end{align}

Therefore, to obtain solutions, we solve \eqref{compatibility_21}
and \eqref{compatibility_22} simultaneously for $\mu$ and $w$.
From physical considerations we remove the cases with $w=-1$ and $\mu \in\{1,2\}$, and we assume $-1<w<1$. 

As before, we choose dust matter ($p=0, w=0$). Then, 
\begin{align}
    & H(t)= \frac{\mu + \sqrt{(9-2 \mu ) \mu -6} \left(1-\frac{2 b_1}{b_1+t^{\sqrt{(9-2 \mu ) \mu
   -6}}}\right)}{3 t}.
\end{align}
As before, two compatibility conditions are satisfied only for $b_1=0$ and $\mu\in\{5/2, 7/2\}$.

For $b_1=0$ and $\mu=5/2$ we have the physical solution
\begin{equation}
\left( p(t),  \rho(t), H(t)\right)  \rightarrow \left(0,0,\frac{3}{2 t}\right) \implies a(t)= a_0 t^{3/2}.
\end{equation}

For $b_1=0$ and $\mu=7/2$ we have the nonphysical solution
\begin{equation}
 \left( p(t),  \rho(t), H(t)\right)  \rightarrow    \left(0,-\frac{9}{2 t^2},\frac{3}{2 t}\right).
\end{equation}
  
As in the previous section, if we impose the equation of the state of the fluid as dust, this fixes the values of $\mu$ to $5/2$. 

\subsection{General solution} \label{Gen_Sol_H}  
In this section, we are interested in an exact solution that gives the general solution of the system. For this purpose,  one can solve the Riccati Equation
\eqref{Riccati}, independent of the EoS. That has the $H(t)$ solution defined by 
\begin{align}
    H(t)=\frac{1}{3 t }\left[\frac{9-2 \mu +r}{2}-\frac{c r \alpha_0^r}{c  \alpha_0^r+ (H_0  t)^r}\right],\label{V}
\end{align}  
where 
\begin{align}
c & =  \frac{-2 \mu +r-6 \alpha_0+9}{2 \mu +r+6 \alpha_0-9}, 
\; \text{and}\;r  = \sqrt{8 \mu  (2 \mu -9)+105}, 
\end{align}%
where for the current time $\alpha_0=H_{0}t_0$, where $t_0$ is the value of $t$ today, $H_0$ is the current value of the Hubble factor, $\alpha_0$ for which we obtain the best-fit values. 

That is the exact solution for $H(t)$ studied in \cite{Micolta-Riascos:2023mqo} (see an analogous case in \cite{Shchigolev:2012rp}, Eq. (36), and in \cite{Garcia-Aspeitia:2022uxz}, Eq. (24)). 
In this case, expressions \eqref{NewFried}, \eqref{NewP} are used to calculate $\rho(t)$ and $p(t)$. Substituting all the expressions in the system \eqref{NewRaych}, \eqref{NewCons}, and \eqref{NewFried} lead to identities.
Because there is an arbitrary constant of integration, and the equations are identically satisfied (no compatibility equations are required), this is the general solution of the system. That result is generic since it does not require specifying the EoS. Hence, Equation \eqref{V} gives a one-parameter family of solutions that gives a complete solution and is independent of the matter content. 

Defining the dimensionless time variable $\tau=H_{0}t$, such that $\alpha_0=H_{0}t_0$, and $\xi=\tau/\alpha_0=t/t_0$,  by definition, the current value of $\xi$ is $\xi_0=1$, the expressions  become
\begin{small}
\begin{align}
 & a(\xi)=\xi^{\frac{1}{6} (-2 \mu -r+9)} \sqrt[3]{\frac{{c+\xi^r}}{{(c+1)}}}, \label{(65)}\\
 & z(\xi)= -1+\xi^{\frac{1}{6} (2 \mu +r-9)} \sqrt[3]{\frac{{(c+1)}}{{c+\xi^r}}}, \label{ztau} \\
 & E(\xi)= \frac{H(\xi)}{H_0} =\frac{1}{3 \alpha_0 \xi } \left[\frac{9-2 \mu +r}{2}-\frac{c r}{c +\xi^r}\right], \label{(66)}
\\
 & p(\xi) = \frac{H_0^2 \left(2 (4 \mu -9) r \left(\xi^{2 r}-c^2\right)+r^2 \left(\xi^r-c \right)^2-7 (4 \mu (2 \mu -9)+45) \left(c +\xi^r\right)^2\right)}{12 \alpha_0^2 \xi^2 \left(c +\xi^r\right)^2}, \label{(68)}\\
 & \rho(\xi) = \frac{H_0^2 \left(-2 (5 \mu -12) r \left(\xi^{2 r}-c^2 \right)+r^2 \left(\xi^r-c \right)^2+(2 \mu -9) (8 \mu -15)
 \left(c  +\xi^r\right)^2\right)}{12 \alpha_0^2 \xi^2 \left(c +\xi^r\right)^2}, \label{(69)}
\\
 & q(\xi)=-\frac{c^2 (2 \mu +r-9) (2 \mu +r-3) +2 c \left(4 \mu ^2-24 \mu +5 r^2+27\right) \xi^r+(-2 \mu +r+3) (-2 \mu +r+9) \xi^{2 r}}{\left((-2 \mu +r+9) \xi^r-c (2 \mu +r-9)\right)^2}, \label{(67)}\\
 & w_{\text{eff}}(\xi)=\frac{2 (4 \mu -9) r \left(\xi^{2 r}-c^2\right)+r^2 \left(\xi^r-c \right)^2-7 (4 \mu  (2 \mu -9)+45)
   \left(c +\xi^r\right)^2}{\left((-2 \mu +r+9) \xi^r-c (2 \mu +r-9)\right) \left((-8 \mu +r+15) \xi^r-c (8 \mu +r-15)\right)}, \label{(70)}\\
 & \Omega_{\text{m}}(\xi)= \frac{(-8 \mu +r+15) \xi^r-c (8 \mu +r-15)}{(-2 \mu +r+9) \xi^r-c (2 \mu +r-9)} \label{(71)}.
\end{align}
 \end{small}
 Taking the limit $\xi \rightarrow \infty$ we have 
  \begin{align*}
& \lim_{\xi \rightarrow \infty} z(\xi)=-1, \quad 
\lim_{\xi \rightarrow \infty} a(\xi)=\infty, \quad 
\lim_{\xi \rightarrow \infty} E (\xi)=0, \quad 
\lim_{\xi \rightarrow \infty} p(\xi)=0, \quad 
\lim_{\xi \rightarrow \infty} \rho(\xi)=0, 
\\
& \lim_{\xi \rightarrow \infty} q(\xi)
=\frac{-13-2 (\mu -4) \mu +\sqrt{8 \mu  (2 \mu -9)+105}}{2 (\mu -2) (\mu -1)}, 
\\
& \lim_{\xi \rightarrow \infty}  w_{\text{eff}} (\xi)= \frac{-7+\sqrt{8 \mu  (2 \mu -9)+105}}{4 (\mu -1)}, \quad \lim_{\xi \rightarrow \infty}   \Omega_{\text{m}}  (\xi) =\frac{5-\sqrt{8 \mu  (2 \mu -9)+105}}{2 (\mu -2)}, 
\end{align*}
and \begin{equation}
\lim_{\xi \rightarrow \infty} \alpha (\xi) =  \frac{1}{6} \left(9-2 \mu +\sqrt{8 \mu  (2 \mu -9)+105}\right)\geq 0,
\end{equation}
where $\alpha(t)=t H$ is the age parameter.
 
The main difficulty of this approach is the need to invert \eqref{ztau} to obtain $\xi$ as a function of $z$ because data is in terms of redshift, which is impossible using analytical tools because the equation is a rational one. However, the variable $\xi$ can be used as a parameter instead of $z$ in the parametric representation.

\subsection{Asymptotic analysis}
\label{Sect:V}
The following is a precise scheme, which does not require inverting \eqref{ztau}.

By introducing the logarithmic independent variable $s= -\ln(1+z)$, with $s\rightarrow -\infty $ as $z\rightarrow \infty$, $s\rightarrow 0$ as $z\rightarrow 0$, and  $s\rightarrow \infty $ as $z\rightarrow -1$, and defining the age parameter is given by  $\alpha = t H$ we obtain the initial value problem 

\begin{align}
   & \alpha '(s)= 9-2 \mu -3 \alpha (s)+\frac{(\mu -2) (\mu -1)}{\alpha (s)}, \label{eq(134)}\\
   &t'(s)={t(s)}/{\alpha(s)}, \label{eq(135)}\\
   &  \alpha(0)=t_0 H_0, t(0)=t_0. \label{eq(136)}
\end{align}


The equation \eqref{eq(134)} gives a one-dimensional dynamical system. The equilibrium points are 
$T_1: \alpha = \frac{1}{6} \left(9-2 \mu -\sqrt{8 \mu  (2 \mu -9)+105}\right)$, satisfying $\alpha>0$ for $1<\mu <2$, and $T_2: \alpha= \frac{1}{6} \left(9-2 \mu +\sqrt{8 \mu  (2 \mu -9)+105}\right)$,  that satisfies $\alpha>0$ for $\mu\in\mathbb{R}$. 

The eigenvalue of $T_1$ is $-3- 36 (\mu -2) (\mu -1)\Big/\left(2 \mu +\sqrt{8 \mu  (2 \mu -9)+105}-9\right)^2>0$ for  $1<\mu <2$. Hence,  $T_1$ is a source whenever it exists.  

The eigenvalue of $T_2$ is  $-3- 36 (\mu -2) (\mu -1)\Big/\left(-2 \mu +\sqrt{8 \mu  (2 \mu -9)+105}+9\right)^2<0$  for $\mu\in\mathbb{R}$. Hence,  $T_2$ is always a sink. That is the asymptotic behaviour for large $s$, which is consistent with \cite{Micolta-Riascos:2023mqo}, in which the attractor solution has an asymptotic age parameter
\begin{align}
    \lim_{t\rightarrow \infty} t H= \frac{1}{6} (9-2 \mu +r). \label{eq135}
\end{align}
We introduce the parameter $\epsilon_0$ such that 
\begin{equation}
 \epsilon_0= \frac{1}{2}\lim_{t\rightarrow \infty} \left(\frac{t_0 H_0 - t H}{t H}\right), \quad \alpha_0=  \frac{1}{6} \left(9 -2 \mu +\sqrt{8 \mu  (2 \mu -9)+105}\right)(1+ 2 \epsilon_0). \label{alpha_0}
\end{equation} 
$\epsilon_0$ is a measure of the limiting value of the relative error in the age parameter $t H$ when it is approximated by $t_0 H_0$. 
When $\epsilon_0=0$,  $\alpha_0=\frac{1}{6} (-2 \mu +r+9)$, which implies $c=0$, in \eqref{ztau}
and \eqref{(66)}, we obtain the leading term 
\begin{align}
    & E(z)= (1+z)^{\frac{6}{ (9-2 \mu +r)}}. \label{(142)}
\end{align}
We obtain the exact value of $E(z)$ by integrating the initial value problem numerically 
\begin{align}
& E'(z)=\frac{E(z) \tau (z) (3 E(z) \tau (z)+2 \mu -8)-(\mu -2) (\mu -1)}{(z+1)E(z) \tau (z)^2}, \; E(0)=1, \label{syst_1}\\
& \tau '(z)=-\frac{1}{(1+z)E(z)}, \; \tau (0)=\frac{1}{6} (2\epsilon_0 +1) (9-2 \mu +r). \label{syst_2}
\end{align}


\subsection{Approximated analytical solution}
\label{Sect:V.1}

Making the substitution $\alpha=e^{-3 s} y ^{\frac{1}{2}}$
in \eqref{eq(134)} is transformed in the
following equation
\begin{align}
& \frac{d y}{d s}= 2 (\mu -2) (\mu -1) e^{6 s}+2 (9-2 \mu) e^{3 s} y^{\frac{1}{2}}. \label{eq(136)b} 
\end{align}
Let $m$ be the solution of the following Bernoulli's equation
\begin{equation}
 \frac{dm}{ds}=2 (9-2 \mu) e^{3 s} m^{\frac{1}{2}}.   \label{eqm}
\end{equation}
The solutions of Bernoulli's equation \eqref{eqm} are three, say
\begin{equation}
\label{(Eq:139)}
m(s)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}
0 & \text{such that}\;   m(0)=0\\
 \frac{1}{9} \left[(9-2 \mu)(1-  e^{3 s}) -3 m_0^{\frac{1}{2}}\right]^2 & \text{such that}\; m(0)=m_0 \\
\frac{1}{9}\left[(9-2 \mu)(1-  e^{3 s}) +3 m_0^{\frac{1}{2}}\right]^2  &  \text{such that}\; m(0)=m_0
\end{array}
\right..
\end{equation}

Taking the difference term by term of \eqref{eq(136)b} and
\eqref{eqm}, we obtain 
\begin{align}
& \frac{d y}{d s}- \frac{dm}{ds}= 2 (\mu -2) (\mu -1) e^{6 s}+2 (9-2 \mu) e^{3 s} \left[ y^{\frac{1}{2}}-  m^{\frac{1}{2}}\right].\label{(EQ129)}
\end{align}
Assuming $y=m+n$, where $n\geq 0$ is the remainder in the approximation of $y$ by $m$, and considering the following inequality 
\begin{equation}\left(m+n\right) ^{\frac{1}{2}}\leq m^{\frac{1}{2}}+n^{\frac{1}{2}}\label{ineq}
\end{equation}
for $m\geq 0$ and $n\geq 0$. Then, from \eqref{(EQ129)}, we obtain the differential inequality
\begin{equation}
\frac{d n}{d s}\leq 2 (\mu -2) (\mu -1) e^{6 s}+2 (9-2 \mu) e^{3 s} n^{\frac{1}{2}}. \label{eqN}
\end{equation}
Suppose that
$n = A^2 e^{6 s}$, with $A$ to be determined.
Then, Equation \eqref{eqN} leads to
\begin{equation}
 3 A^2 \leq  (\mu -2) (\mu -1) + (9-2 \mu)  A. \label{inequality}
\end{equation}
The equality occurs
at the $A$-values 
\begin{align}
  &  A_-= \frac{1}{6} \left(9-2 \mu -\sqrt{8 \mu  (2 \mu -9)+105}\right),   A_+=\frac{1}{6}\left(9-2 \mu +\sqrt{8 \mu  (2 \mu -9)+105}\right),
\end{align}
which are the $\alpha$-values of the equilibrium points $T_1$ and $T_2$ of the one-dimensional dynamical system \eqref{eq(134)}.

We choose the third solution of Bernoulli's equation in \eqref{(Eq:139)}. Hence,  we obtain an approximation of $y$, given by 
\begin{align}
    y_{\text{approx}}=  \frac{1}{9} \left[(9-2 \mu)(1-  e^{3 s}) + 3 m_0^{\frac{1}{2}}\right]^2  + A^2 e^{6 s}.
\end{align}
Then, we obtain an approximation of $\alpha$, given by 
\begin{align}
    \alpha_{\text{approx}}(s)= \left[ \frac{1}{9} \left((9-2 \mu)(1-  e^{3 s}) + 3 m_0^{\frac{1}{2}}\right)^2 e^{-6 s} + A^2 \right]^{\frac{1}{2}}. 
\end{align}
Calculating the limit 
\begin{align}
    \lim_{s \rightarrow +\infty}   \alpha_{\text{approx}}(s)=  \frac{1}{3} \sqrt{9 A^2+(9-2 \mu )^2},
\end{align}
and imposing the equality with \eqref{eq135}, we have 
\begin{align}
A^2 & = \frac{1}{9} \mu  \left(\mu -\sqrt{8 \mu  (2 \mu -9)+105}+9\right)+\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{8 \mu  (2 \mu -9)+105}-\frac{23}{6}, \label{(EQ140)}
\end{align}
that is non-negative and satisfies the inequality \eqref{inequality} for  $2\leq \mu \leq \frac{1}{10} \left(63+\sqrt{849}\right)\lesssim 9.21376$.  Moreover, $A \in [0, A_+]$ for  $2\leq\mu \leq3.25162$, or $7.59791\leq\mu \leq9.21376$. 

To calculate $m_0$, we use the condition $\alpha_{\text{approx}}(0)=\alpha_0:= t_0 H_0$. 
Hence, $m_0= \alpha_0^2-A^2$.



In terms of redshift, we have 
\begin{align}
    \alpha_{\text{approx}}(z)= \left[ \frac{1}{9} \left((9-2 \mu)\left(1-  (1+z)^{-3}\right) + 3 \left(\alpha_0^2-A^2\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\right)^2 (1+z)^6 + A^2 \right]^{\frac{1}{2}}, 
\end{align}
where $A$ is defined by \eqref{(EQ140)}.



For the equation \eqref{eq(135)} we obtain
\begin{equation}
  t^{-1} \frac{dt}{ds}=\left[ \frac{1}{9} \left((9-2 \mu)(1-  e^{3 s}) + 3 m_0^{\frac{1}{2}}\right)^2 e^{-6 s} + A^2 \right]^{-\frac{1}{2}},
\end{equation}
with the solution given by
\begin{align}
t(s)& =t_{0}\exp \left( \bigints_{0}^{s} \left[ \frac{1}{9} \left((9-2 \mu)(1-  e^{3 \zeta}) + 3 m_0^{\frac{1}{2}}\right)^2 e^{-6 \zeta} + A^2 \right]^{-\frac{1}{2}} d\zeta\right).
\end{align}


Now, considering  an asymptotic expansion of the integral for large $s$, 
where $m_0= \alpha_0^2-A^2$, and $A$ is defined by \eqref{(EQ140)}, we obtain 
\begin{align}
t(s)&  \simeq t_{0}e^{\bigints_{0}^{s} \frac{3}{\sqrt{9 A^2+(9-2 \mu )^2}}  d\zeta} =t_{0} e^{\frac{3 s}{\sqrt{9 A^2+(9-2 \mu )^2}}}, \label{eqAsymptotict}
\end{align}


\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.65]{Ez.pdf}
    \caption{Expression \eqref{Ez} compared the numerical solution of \eqref{syst_1} and \eqref{syst_2}, the leading term  $ (1+z)^{\frac{6}{ (9-2 \mu +r)}}$,  $E(z)$ ($\Lambda$CDM) for $\mu=2.5$ and different values of $\epsilon_0$. }
    \label{fig:Ez}
\end{figure}

In consequence
\begin{align}
&H(s)\simeq \frac{H_0}{\alpha_0}\left[ \frac{1}{9} \left((9-2 \mu)(1-  e^{3 s}) + 3 m_0^{\frac{1}{2}}\right)^2 e^{-6 s} + A^2 \right]^{\frac{1}{2}} e^{-\frac{3 s}{\sqrt{9 A^2+(9-2 \mu )^2}}},
\end{align}
where we have substituted an asymptotic expansion of the integral for large $s$ given by \eqref{eqAsymptotict}. 


Finally, 
\begin{align}
& E(z) = \frac{H(z)}{H_0} \simeq E_{\text{approx}}(z)\nonumber \\
& = \frac{1}{\alpha_0} \left[ \frac{1}{9} \left((9-2 \mu)\left(1-  (1+z)^{-3}\right) + 3 m_0^{\frac{1}{2}}\right)^2 (1+z)^{6} + A^2 \right]^{\frac{1}{2}} \left(1+z\right)^\frac{3}{\sqrt{9 A^2+(9-2 \mu )^2}}. \label{Ez}
\end{align}
and 
\begin{equation}
t(z) \simeq t_{\text{approx}}(z)=t_{0} (1+z)^{-\frac{3}{\sqrt{9 A^2+(9-2 \mu )^2}}}, \label{tz}
\end{equation}
as $z\rightarrow -1$, 
where $\alpha_0$ es defined by \eqref{alpha_0}, 
$A$ is defined by \eqref{(EQ140)} and $m_0= \alpha_0^2-A^2$. 

Figure \ref{fig:Ez} it is presented Expression \eqref{Ez} compared the numerical solution of \eqref{syst_1} and \eqref{syst_2}, the leading term  $ (1+z)^{\frac{6}{ (9-2 \mu +r)}}$, and $E(z)$ of $\Lambda$CDM for $\mu=2.5$ and different values of $\epsilon_0$ which shows that generically, for  $2\leq \mu \lesssim 9.21376$ there is a good accuracy of the approximation of the exact value $E(z)$ by the asymptotic approximation \eqref{Ez} as $z\rightarrow -1$. 









\subsection{Discussion}
\label{Sect:VIII}
Our analysis shows differences between standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology-based GR and the fractional version. Given the energy density expression $\rho $ in GR, one calculates the Hubble parameter through the Friedmann equation. Therefore, we deduce $H$, and we investigate the cosmological history. Finally, we are considering the existence of dark matter ($w =0$), $w =-1$ for $\Lambda$ and $-1<w<-1/3$ for quintessence,  as suggested from the observations.

If we proceed as before, to give $w$, and using  $w=p/\rho $, then using the equations for $\rho$ and $p$, say, as in Equations \eqref{NewFried} and \eqref{NewP}. With this expressions one calculate $H\left(t\right) $ and $q\left( t\right)$. In fractional cosmology, the asymptotic behaviour $H\left( t\right) \sim 1/t$ is a characteristic due to the fractional parameter $\mu>1$. 

We were related to the possible matter scenarios, and according to the relevant discussion about the EoS $w$, we have two regimes of interest. 

First, consider $\rho$-like dark matter with the behaviour of dark energy, $-1<w <-1/3$, say quintessence. This case was investigated, and the relevant results are the following.

In the first approach we solve  \eqref{First_Eq_H} for $H$, obtaining two solutions $H_{1,2}(t)= \frac{\alpha_\pm}{t}$ where the $\alpha$ parameter is defined by \eqref{apm-1} and takes the values $\alpha_\pm$. 

Therefore, to obtain solutions, we solve \eqref{compatibility_1}
and \eqref{compatibility_2} simultaneously for $\mu$ and $w$. 
For the choice $\epsilon=-1$ we have the solutions for equations \eqref{compatibility_1}
and \eqref{compatibility_2}, 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $w= \frac{7+\sqrt{8 \mu  (2 \mu -9)+105}}{4(1- \mu)}\; \text{ if }\; \mu <1 \; \text{or}\; 1<\mu
   <2 \; \text{or}\; 2<\mu <\frac{5}{2} \; \text{or}\; \mu >\frac{5}{2}$.
   
   \item $\mu= 1 \; \text{ if}\; w\neq 1$. 
   
   \item $\mu = 2\; \text{ if }\; 1<w\leq 2 \; \text{or}\; w<1$.
   
   \item $\mu= \frac{5}{2}\; \text{ if }\; w\geq \frac{4}{3}$.
   
   \item $\mu=\frac{5}{2}, w= -2$.   
\end{itemize}

For $\epsilon=1$, equations \eqref{compatibility_1}
and \eqref{compatibility_2}  lead to 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $w=\frac{-7+\sqrt{8 \mu  (2 \mu -9)+105}}{4 (\mu -1)} \; \text{ if }\; \mu <1 \; \text{or }\; 1<\mu <2 \; \text{or}\; 2<\mu <\frac{5}{2} \; \text{or}\; \mu >\frac{5}{2}$.
    \item $\mu =2 \; \text{ if} \; w\geq 2$.
    \item $\mu =\frac{5}{2}\;\text{ if }\; 1<w\leq \frac{4}{3} \; \text{or}\;    w<1$.
    \item $\mu =1, w= -\frac{5}{7}$. 
    \item $\mu=2, w= -\frac{1}{2}$.
\end{itemize}

In the second approach consisted in solving for $\mu\neq 1$ a Riccati equation \eqref{Rccati2}
which follows from substitution $p=w \rho$ in \eqref{NewRaych} and removing $\rho$ using \eqref{NewFried}. The exact solution is \eqref{exactRicatti2}
where $H_0$ is the current value of $H$ at $t=t_0$.  From \eqref{NewRaych} and \eqref{NewCons} are found
that compatibility conditions have to be satisfied for all $t$. Then, necessarily $b_1=0$.  
Therefore, to obtain solutions, we solve \eqref{compatibility_21}
and \eqref{compatibility_22} simultaneously for $\mu$ and $w$. We have the following cases. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $w=-1 \; \text{ if }\; \mu \geq 3$.
    
    \item $w=\frac{7+ \sqrt{8 \mu  (2 \mu -9)+105}}{4(1-\mu)}\; \text{ if }\; 2<\mu <\frac{5}{2}\; \text{or}\; \mu >\frac{5}{2}\; \text{or}\; \mu <2$. 
    
    \item $w=\frac{-7 +\sqrt{8 \mu  (2 \mu -9)+105}}{4 (\mu -1)} \; \text{ if }\; 2<\mu <\frac{5}{2}\; \text{or}\; \frac{5}{2}<\mu \leq \frac{1}{4} \left(9+\sqrt{201}\right)\; \text{or}\; \mu <2$.
    
    \item $\mu=2 \; \text{ if }\; w\leq -\frac{4}{3}$.
    
    \item $\mu=\frac{5}{2}\; \text{ if }\; w\geq -\frac{8}{9}$.
    
    \item $\mu= 1,w=  -\frac{5}{7}$. 
   
   \item $\mu= 2,w= -\frac{1}{2}$. 
   
   \item $\mu= \frac{5}{2},w= -2$. 
   \end{itemize}
From physical considerations we remove the cases with $w=-1$ and $\mu \in\{1,2\}$, and we assume $-1<w<1$. 

Using the two previous approaches, one obtains power-law solutions of the types $a=(t/t_0)^{\alpha}$. Additionally, one has to impose two compatibility conditions which give the possible $(\mu, w)$-values that make them solutions. That means that any solution of power-law type is indeed a particular exact solution of the system, but not the general solution. To obtain an exact solution that gives the general solution of the system (for any value of the free parameters that have an integration constant), we solved the Riccati Equation
\eqref{Riccati}, independent of the EoS. That is solution \eqref{V}. This result is generic since it does not require specifying the EoS. That lead to 
 $a(\tau)$ given by \eqref{(65)}, $H(\tau)$ given by \eqref{(66)},
$p(\tau)$ given by \eqref{(68)}, $\rho(\tau)$ given by \eqref{(69)}, $q(\tau)$ given by \eqref{(67)},   
 $w_{\text{eff}}(\tau)$, given by \eqref{(70)} and $\Omega_{\text{m}}(\tau)$ given by 
\eqref{(71)}, where we defined the new time variable $\tau=H_{0}t$, such that $\alpha_0=H_{0}t_0$ and $ c = \frac{-2 \mu +r-6 \alpha_0+9}{2 \mu +r+6 \alpha_0-9}$,  and  $r= \sqrt{8 \mu  (2 \mu -9)+105}$.

We have 
\begin{equation}\label{Ominfty}
\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty}  w_{\text{eff}} (t) = \frac{-7+\sqrt{8 \mu  (2 \mu -9)+105}}{4 (\mu -1)}, \quad 
  \lim_{t \rightarrow \infty}   \Omega_{\text{m}}  (t) = \frac{5-\sqrt{8 \mu  (2 \mu -9)+105}}{2 (\mu -2)}, 
\end{equation}
such that $-1\leq  \lim_{t \rightarrow \infty}  w_{\text{eff}} (t) \leq -1/3$ for $\mu \leq \frac{5}{2}$, and  
$0\leq   \lim_{t \rightarrow \infty}   \Omega_{\text{m}}  (t) \leq 1$ for $1\leq \mu \leq \frac{5}{2}$.
 For large $t$, we have the asymptotic solution 
\begin{equation}
H (t) \simeq  \frac{1}{6t} \left(9-2 \mu +\sqrt{8 \mu  (2 \mu -9)+105}\right),
\end{equation}
and \begin{equation}
\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \alpha (t) =    \frac{1}{6} \left(9-2 \mu +\sqrt{8 \mu  (2 \mu -9)+105}\right)\geq 0,
\end{equation}
where $\alpha(t)=t H$ is the age parameter. 

Finally, combining a solution of Bernoulli’s equation \eqref{eqm}, the inequality \eqref{ineq}, solving the differential inequality \eqref{eqN}, and approximating the different quadrature, we have
\begin{align*}
& E(z)  \simeq \frac{1}{\alpha_0} \left[ \frac{1}{9} \left((9-2 \mu)\left(1-  (1+z)^{-3}\right) + 3 m_0^{\frac{1}{2}}\right)^2 (1+z)^{6} + A^2 \right]^{\frac{1}{2}} \left(1+z\right)^\frac{3}{\sqrt{9 A^2+(9-2 \mu )^2}}. 
\end{align*}
and 
\begin{equation*}
t(z) \simeq t_{0} (1+z)^{-\frac{3}{\sqrt{9 A^2+(9-2 \mu )^2}}},
\end{equation*}
as $z\rightarrow -1$, 
where $\alpha_0$ es defined by \eqref{alpha_0}, 
$A$ is defined by \eqref{(EQ140)}, satisfying the inequality \eqref{inequality}, and $m_0= \alpha_0^2-A^2$. This is an accurate approximation of $E(z)$ as $z\rightarrow -1$ provided  $2\leq \mu \leq \frac{1}{10} \left(63+\sqrt{849}\right)\lesssim 9.21376$.  Moreover, $A \in [0, A_+]$ for  $2\leq\mu \leq3.25162$, or $7.59791\leq\mu \leq9.21376$.

\section{Cosmological constraints}
\label{Sect:VII}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In this section, to study the capability of the models obtained in Fractional Cosmology to describe the late-time accelerated Universe expansion, we shall constrain the free parameters with the SNe Ia data and OHD. In particular, for the first one, we consider the Pantheon sample \cite{Scolnic_Complete_2018}, which consists of $1048$ supernovae data points in the redshift range $0.01\leq z\leq 2.3$. On the other hand, we consider the OHD compiled by Magaña \textit{et al.} \cite{Magana_Cardassian_2018}, which consists of $51$ data points in the redshift range $0.07\leq z\leq 2.36$. 

For the constraints, we compute the best-fit parameters and their respective confidence regions at $1\sigma(68.3\%)$, $2\sigma(95.5\%)$ and $3\sigma(99.7\%)$ of confidence level (CL) with the affine-invariant Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method \cite{Goodman_Ensemble_2010}, implemented in the pure-Python code \textit{emcee} \cite{Foreman_emcee_2013}, by setting $35$ chains or ``walkers''. As a convergence test, we compute, at every $50$ step, the autocorrelation time $\tau_{corr}$ of the chains provided by the \textit{emcee} module. Hence, if the current step is larger than $50\tau_{corr}$ and the values of $\tau_{corr}$ changed by less than $1\%$, then we will consider that the chains are converged, and the constraint is stopped; being discarded the first $5\tau_{corr}$ steps as ``burn-in'' steps. This convergence test is complemented with the calculation of the mean acceptance fraction, which must have a value between $0.2$ and $0.5$ \cite{Foreman_emcee_2013} and can be modified by the stretch move provided by the \textit{emcee} module.

For this Bayesian statistical analysis, we need to construct the following Gaussian likelihood:
\begin{equation}\label{likelihood}
    \mathcal{L}=\mathcal{N}\exp{\left(-\frac{\chi_{I}^{2}}{2}\right)},
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{N}$ is a normalization constant, which does not influence the MCMC analysis, and $\chi_{I}^{2}$ is the merit function of each data set considered, i.e., $I$ stands for SNe Ia, OHD, and their joint analysis. In the following subsections, we will briefly describe the construction of the merit function of each data set, and we will present the main results and discussions.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Observational Hubble parameter data}
\label{Sect:VII.1}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The merit function for the OHD is constructed as
\begin{equation}\label{meritOHD}
    \chi_{OHD}^{2}=\sum_{i=1}^{51}{\left[\frac{H_{i}-H_{th}(z_{i},\theta)}{\sigma_{H,i}}\right]^{2}},
\end{equation}
where $H_{i}$ is the observational Hubble parameter at redshift $z_{i}$ with an associated error $\sigma_{H, i}$, all of them provided by the OHD sample, $H_{th}$ is the theoretical Hubble parameter at the same redshift, and $\theta$ encompasses the free parameters of the model under study. It is important to mention that the current value of the Hubble parameter, $H_{0}$, is a free parameter of the model, which for the constraint is written as $H_{0}=100\frac{\text{km/s}}{\text{Mpc}}h$, with $h$ dimensionless. Considering that we expect a value of $H_{0}$ between the value obtained from Planck CMB of $H_{0}=67.4$ \cite{Planck:2018vyg} for the $\Lambda$CDM model and the value obtained by A. G. Riess \textit{et al.} of $H_{0}=74.03$ \cite{Riess:2019cxk} in a model-independent way, then we consider for $h$ the flat prior $h\in F(0.4, 1)$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Type Ia supernovae data}
\label{Sect:VII.2}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Similarly to the OHD, the merit function for the SNe Ia data is constructed as
\begin{equation}\label{meritSNeIa}
    \chi_{SNe}^{2}=\sum_{i=1}^{1048}{\left[\frac{\mu_{i}-\mu_{th}(z_{i},\theta)}{\sigma_{\mu,i}}\right]^{2}},
\end{equation}
where $\mu_{i}$ is the observational distance modulus of each SNe Ia at redshift $z_{i}$ with an associated error $\sigma_{\mu, i}$, $\mu_{th}$ is the theoretical distance modulus for each SNe Ia at the same redshift, and $\theta$ encompasses the free parameters of the model under study. Following this line, for a spatially flat FLRW spacetime, the theoretical distance modulus is given by
\begin{equation}\label{theoreticaldistance}
    \mu_{th}(z_{i},\theta)=5\log_{10}{\left[\frac{d_{L}(z_{i},\theta)}{\text{Mpc}}\right]}+\Bar{\mu},
\end{equation}
where $\Bar{\mu}=5\left[\log_{10}{\left(c\right)}+5\right]$, with $c$ the speed of light given in units of $\text{km/s}$. The above expression relates the merit function with the theoretical Hubble parameter through the luminosity distance, $d_{L}$ as follows
\begin{equation}\label{luminosity}
    d_{L}(z_{i},\theta)=(1+z_{i})\int_{0}^{z_{i}}{\frac{dz'}{H_{th}(z',\theta)}}.
\end{equation}

On the other hand, the distance estimator used in the Pantheon sample is obtained by a modified version of Tripp's formula \cite{Tripp_Luminosity_1998}, with two of the three nuisance parameters calibrated to zero with the BEAMS whit Bias Correction (BBC) method \cite{Kessler_Correcting_2017}. Hence, the observational distance modulus for each SNe Ia reads
\begin{equation}\label{pantheondistance}
    \mu_{i}=m_{B,i}-\mathcal{M},
\end{equation}
where $m_{B, i}$ is the corrected apparent B-band magnitude of a fiducial SNe Ia at redshift $z_{i}$ with an associated error $\sigma_{m_B, i}$, all of them provided by the Pantheon sample \footnote{Available online in the GitHub repository \url{https://github.com/dscolnic/Pantheon}. The corrected apparent B-band magnitude $m_{B, i}$ for each SNe Ia with their respective redshifts $z_{i}$ and errors $\sigma_{m_{B}, i}$ are available in the document \textit{lcparam\_full\_long.txt}.}, and $\mathcal{M}$ is a nuisance parameter which must be jointly estimated with the free parameters $\theta$ of the theoretical model. Also, the Pantheon sample provides the systematic uncertainties in the BBC approach $\mathbf{C}_{sys}$ \footnote{Available online in the GitHub repository \url{https://github.com/dscolnic/Pantheon} in the document \textit{sys\_full\_long.txt}.}. Therefore, we can rewrite the merit function \eqref{meritSNeIa} in matrix notation (denoted by bold symbols) as
\begin{equation}\label{meritSNeIamatrix}
    \chi_{SNe}^{2}=\mathbf{M}(z,\theta,\mathcal{M})^{\dagger}\mathbf{C}^{-1}\mathbf{M}(z,\theta,\mathcal{M}),
\end{equation}
where $[\mathbf{M}(z,\theta,\mathcal{M})]_{i}=m_{B,i}-\mu_{th}(z_{i},\theta)-\mathcal{M}$ and $\mathbf{C}=\mathbf{D}_{stat}+\mathbf{C}_{sys}$ is the total uncertainties covariance matrix, being $\mathbf{D}_{stat}=diag(\sigma_{m_{B},i}^{2})$ the statistical uncertainties of $m_{B}$.

Finally, one can marginalize over the nuisance parameters $\Bar{\mu}$ and $\mathcal{M}$, by defining $\Bar{\mathcal{M}}=\Bar{\mu}+\mathcal{M}$, and then, the merit function \eqref{meritSNeIamatrix} can be expanded as \cite{Lazkos_Exploring_2005}
\begin{equation}\label{meritSNeIaexpanded}
    \chi_{SNe}^{2}=A(z,\theta)-2B(z,\theta)\Bar{\mathcal{M}}+C\Bar{\mathcal{M}}^{2},
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}\label{defofA}
    A(z,\theta)=\mathbf{M}(z,\theta,\Bar{\mathcal{M}}=0)^{\dagger}\mathbf{C}^{-1}\mathbf{M}(z,\theta,\Bar{\mathcal{M}}=0),
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{defofB}
    B(z,\theta)=\mathbf{M}(z,\theta,\Bar{\mathcal{M}}=0)^{\dagger}\mathbf{C}^{-1}\mathbf{1},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    C=\mathbf{1}\mathbf{C}^{-1}\mathbf{1}.
\end{equation}
Therefore, by minimizing the expanded merit function \eqref{meritSNeIaexpanded} with respect to $\Bar{\mathcal{M}}$, it is obtained $\Bar{\mathcal{M}}=B(z,\theta)/C$, and the expanded merit function reduced to
\begin{equation}\label{meritSNeIaminimize}
    \chi_{SNe}^{2}=A(z,\theta)-\frac{B(z,\theta)^{2}}{C},
\end{equation}
which depends only on the free parameters of the theoretical model.

It is essential to mention that the expanded and minimized merit function \eqref{meritSNeIaminimize} provides the same information as the merit function \eqref{meritSNeIamatrix}. That is a consequence of the fact that the best-fit parameters minimize the merit function. Therefore, the evaluation of the best-fit parameters in the merit function can be used as an indicator of the goodness of the fit independently of the data set used: the smaller the value of $\chi_{min}^{2}$ is, the better is the fit. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Joint analysis and theoretical Hubble parameter integration}
\label{Sect:VII.3}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The merit function for the joint analysis is constructed directly as
\begin{equation}\label{meritjoint}
    \chi_{joint}^{2}=\chi_{OHD}^{2}+\chi_{SNe}^{2},
\end{equation}
with $\chi^{2}_{OHD}$ and $\chi^{2}_{SNe}$ given by Eqs. \eqref{meritOHD} and \eqref{meritSNeIaminimize}, respectively. Following this line, note how in the merit function of the two data sets, the respective model is considered through the (theoretical) Hubble parameter as a function of the redshift (see Eqs. \eqref{meritOHD} and \eqref{luminosity}). Hence, for the constraint, we numerically integrate the system given by Eqs. \eqref{eq(134)} and \eqref{eq(135)}, which represent a system for the variables $(\alpha,t)$ as a function of $s=-\ln{\left(1+z\right)}$, and for which we consider the initial conditions $\alpha(s=0)\equiv\alpha_{0}=t_{0}H_{0}$ and $t(s=0)\equiv t_{0}=\alpha_{0}/H_{0}$. Then, the Hubble parameter is obtained numerically by $H_{th}(z)=\alpha(z)/t(z)$. For this integration, we consider the NumbaLSODA code, a python wrapper of the LSODA method in ODEPACK to C++\footnote{Available online in the GitHub repository \url{https://github.com/Nicholaswogan/numbalsoda}}. Even more, for further comparison, we also constraint the free parameters of the $\Lambda$CDM model, whose respective Hubble parameter as a function of the redshift is given by
\begin{equation}\label{HLCDM}
    H(z)=H_{0}\sqrt{\Omega_{m,0}(1+z)^{3}+1-\Omega_{m,0}}.
\end{equation}

Finally, based on the analysis made in Section \ref{Sect:V.1}, we consider for the free parameter $\alpha_{0}$ the parameterization given by Eq. \eqref{alpha_0}. Therefore, the free parameters of the Fractional cosmological model are $\theta=\{h,\mu,\epsilon_{0}\}$, and the free parameters of the $\Lambda$CDM model are $\theta=\{h,\Omega_{m,0}\}$. For the free parameters $\mu$, $\epsilon_{0}$, and $\Omega_{m,0}$ we consider the following flat priors: $\mu\in F(1,4)$, $\epsilon_{0}\in F(-0.1,0.1)$, and $\Omega_{m,0}\in F(0,1)$. It is important to mention that, due to a degeneracy between $H_{0}$ and $\mathcal{M}$, the SNe Ia data is not able to constraint the free parameter $h$ (as a reminder $H_{0}=100\frac{\text{km/s}}{\text{Mpc}}h$), contrary to what happens in the OHD and, consequently, in the joint analysis. So, the posterior distribution of $h$ for the SNe Ia data is expected to cover all the prior distributions. On the other hand, the prior chosen for $\epsilon_{0}$ is because $\epsilon_0$ is a measure of the limiting value of the relative error in the age parameter $t H$ when it is approximated by $t_0 H_0$ as given by Eq. \eqref{alpha_0}. For the mean value $\epsilon_0=0$, we acquire $\alpha_0=\frac{1}{6} (-2 \mu +r+9)$, which implies $c=0$, and then, we have  the leading term  for $E(z)$ defined by \eqref{(142)}. The lower prior of $\mu$ is because the Hubble parameter \eqref{3} becomes negative when $\mu<1$, in the absence of matter, as we can see from Section \ref{Sect:III}.

\subsection{Results and discussion}
\label{Sect:VII.4}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In Table \ref{tab:emcee}, we present the total steps, the mean acceptance fraction, and the autocorrelation time $\tau_{corr}$ of each free parameter obtained when the convergence test is fulfilled during our MCMC analysis for both, the Fractional cosmological model and the $\Lambda$CDM model. The values of the mean acceptance fraction are obtained for a value of the stretch move of $a=7$ for the $\Lambda$CDM model and $a=3.5$ for the Fractional cosmological model.

The best-fit values of the free parameters space for the $\Lambda$CDM model and the Fractional cosmological model, obtained for the SNe Ia data, OHD, and in their joint analysis, with their corresponding $\chi^{2}_{min}$ criteria, are presented in Table \ref{tab:bestfits}. The uncertainties correspond to $1\sigma$, $2\sigma$, and $3\sigma$ CL. In Figures \ref{fig:TriangleLCDM} and \ref{fig:TriangleFractional}, we depict the posterior distribution and joint admissible regions of the free parameters space of the $\Lambda$CDM model and the Fractional cosmological model, respectively. The joint admissible regions correspond to $1\sigma$, $2\sigma$, and $3\sigma$ CL. Due to the degeneracy between $H_{0}$ and $\mathcal{M}$, the distribution of $h$ for the SNe Ia data was not represented in their full parameter space.

From the values for the $\chi^{2}_{min}$ criteria presented in Table \ref{tab:bestfits}, it is possible to see that the $\Lambda$CDM model is the best model to constraint the SNe Ia, OHD, and SNe Ia + OHD data. Nevertheless, the Fractional cosmological model studied in this paper exhibit values of the $\chi^{2}_{min}$ criteria close to the values of the $\Lambda$CDM model, with differences of $1.2$ for the SNe Ia data, $2.2$ for the OHD data, and $4.8$ for their joint analysis. So, this Fractional cosmological model is suitable for describing the SNe Ia and OHD data, as can be seen from Figure \ref{fig:SNeFractional} and Figure \ref{fig:OHDFractional}, which are characterized by accounting for a universe that experiences a transition between a deceleration expansion phase to an accelerated one. Therefore, Fractional Cosmology can be considered an alternative valid cosmological model to describe the late-time Universe. It is essential to mention that the core of this work is to probe this possibility for Fractional Cosmology by studying a particular model; the $\Lambda$CDM model is used only as a reference model for this aim.

The analysis from the SNe Ia data leads to $h=0.696_{-0.295}^{+0.302}$, $\mu=1.340_{-0.339}^{+2.651}$ and  $\epsilon_0=\left(1.976_{-2.067}^{+1.709}\right)\times 10^{-2}$, which are the best-fit values at $3\sigma$ CL. In this case, the value obtained for $h$ cannot be considered as a best fit due to the degeneracy between $H_{0}$ and $\mathcal{M}$. On the other hand, the lower limit of the best fit for $\mu$ is very close to $1$. That is because the posterior distribution for this parameter is close to this value, as seen from Figure \ref{fig:TriangleFractional}. That indicates that a value of the SNe Ia data prefers $\mu<1$, but, as a reminder, this value leads to a negative Hubble parameter in the absence of matter. However, as can be seen from the same Figure \ref{fig:TriangleFractional}, the posterior distribution for these parameters is multi-modal (this explains the large value of $\tau_{corr}$ presented in Table \ref{tab:emcee}) and, therefore, it is possible to obtain a best-fit value that satisfies $\mu>1$. It is important to mention that the OHD and the joint analysis do not experience this issue, which allows us to maintain the validity of the prior used for $\mu$.

On the other hand, the analysis from OHD leads to  $h=0.675_{-0.021}^{+0.041}$, $\mu=2.239_{-1.190}^{+1.386}$ and $\epsilon_0=\left(0.865_{-0.773}^{+0.793}\right)\times 10^{-2}$, which are the best-fit values at $3\sigma$ CL. In this case, note how the OHD can properly constrain the free parameters $h$, $\mu$ and $\epsilon_{0}$, i.e., we obtain the best fit for the priors considered in our MCMC analysis. Also, note how the posterior distribution of $\mu$ includes the value of $1$, as seen from Figure \ref{fig:TriangleFractional}, but for a CL more grater than $3\sigma$.

Finally, the joint analysis with data from SNe Ia + OHD leads to $h=0.684_{-0.027}^{+0.031}$, $\mu=1.840_{-0.773}^{+1.446}$ and $\epsilon_0=\left(1.213_{-1.057}^{+0.482}\right)\times 10^{-2}$, which are the best-fit values at $3\sigma$ CL. Focusing our analysis on these results, we can conclude that the region in which $\mu>2$ is not ruled out by observations. On the other hand, these best-fit values lead to an age of the Universe with a value of $t_0=\alpha_0/H_0=25.62_{-4.46}^{+6.89}\;\text{Gyrs}$ at $3\sigma$ CL. This fact to find a universe roughly twice older as one of the $\Lambda$CDM models, which is also in disagreement with the value obtained with globular clusters, with a value of $t_0=13.5^{+0.16}_{-0.14}\pm 0.23$ \citep{Valcin:2021}, is a distinction of the Fractional Cosmology. This result also agrees with the analysis made in \cite{Garcia-Aspeitia:2022uxz}, section 8, where the best-fit $\mu$-value is obtained from the reconstruction of $H(z)$ for different priors of $\mu$. The results are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:BEST-FIT}. In \cite{Garcia-Aspeitia:2022uxz} was considered a set of 31 points obtained by differential age tools, namely cosmic chronometers (CC), represents the measurements of the Hubble parameter, which is cosmological independent \cite{Moresco:2016mzx} (in the present research we consider the data-sets from \cite{Magana_Cardassian_2018}, which consists of $51$ data points in the redshift range $0.07\leq z\leq 2.36$, 20 more points as compared with \cite{Moresco:2016mzx}). The 1048 luminosity modulus measurements, known as the Pantheon sample, from Type Ia Supernovae cover a region $0.01<z<2.3$  \cite{Scolnic_Complete_2018}. In \cite{Garcia-Aspeitia:2022uxz}, it is unclear if the different priors used for $\mu$ lead to properly constraining $\mu$. Their analysis is inconclusive because of their present different values of $\mu$ for the different priors used.

In order to establish that this Fractional cosmological model can describe a universe that experiences a transition from a decelerated expansion phase to an accelerated one, we compute the deceleration parameter $q=-1-\dot{H}/H^{2}$, which using the Riccati Equation \eqref{Riccati}, leads to
\begin{equation}
q(\alpha(s))= 2 + \frac{2 (\mu -4) }{\alpha(s)}-\frac{(\mu -2) (\mu -1)}{\alpha^2(s)}.\label{DecelerationFinal}
\end{equation}
Following this line, in Figure \ref{fig:qFractional}, we depict the deceleration parameter for the Fractional cosmological model as a function of the redshift $z$, obtained for the best-fit values for the SNe Ia+OHD data presented in the Table \ref{tab:bestfits}, with an error band at $3\sigma$ CL. We also depict the deceleration parameter for the $\Lambda$CDM model as a reference model. From this figure, we can conclude that the Fractional cosmological model effectively experiences this transition at $z_{t}\gtrapprox 1$, with the characteristic that $z_{t}>z_{t,\Lambda CDM}$, being $z_{t,\Lambda CDM}$ the transition redshift of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Even more, the current deceleration parameter of the Fractional cosmological model is $q_{0}=-0.37_{-0.11}^{+0.08}$ at $3\sigma$ CL. On the other hand, in Figures \ref{fig:OmFractional} and \ref{fig:OdFractional}, we depict the matter density and fractional density parameters for the Fractional cosmological model (the last one interpreted as dark energy), respectively, as a function of the redshift $z$, for the best-fit values for the SNe Ia+OHD data presented in the Table \ref{tab:bestfits}, with an error band at $1\sigma$ CL. We depict the matter density and dark energy density parameters in both figures for the $\Lambda$CDM model. From Figure \ref{fig:OmFractional}, we can see that the matter density parameter for the Fractional cosmological model, obtained from Eq. \eqref{(71)}, presents large uncertainties, which can be a consequence of their reconstruction from a Hubble parameter that does not take into account any EoS. In this sense, the current value of this matter density parameter at $1\sigma$ CL is $\Omega_{m,0}=0.531_{-0.260}^{+0.195}$, a value that is in agreement with the asymptotic value obtained from Eq. \eqref{Ominfty} of $\Omega_{m,t\to\infty}=0.519_{-0.262}^{+0.199}$, computed at $1\sigma$ CL for the best-fit values for the SNe Ia+OHD data presented in the Table \ref{tab:bestfits}. Therefore, this more grater value of $\Omega_{m,0}$ for the Fractional cosmological model can, in principle, explain the lower value of the current deceleration parameter $q_{0}$ and the excess of matter in the effective term $\rho_{\text{frac}}=3(\mu-1)t^{-1}H$ with $\Omega_{\text{frac}}(\alpha(s))=(\mu-1)/\alpha(s)$ (see subsection \ref{Sect:III.2}). Note that the current value $\Omega_{\text{frac},0}$ can be interpreted as the dark energy density parameter for the Fractional cosmological model as $\Omega_{\text{frac},0}=0.469_{-0.195}^{+0.260}$, which satisfies the condition $\Omega_{m,0}+\Omega_{\text{frac},0}=1$.

Finally, we compute the cosmographic parameter known as the jerk, which quantifies if the Fractional cosmological model tends to $\Lambda$ or its another kind of DE, which can be written as
\begin{align}
    &j(s)=q(s)(2q(s)+1)-\frac{dq(s)}{ds}, 
\end{align}
where $q$ is given by Eq. \eqref{DecelerationFinal}. Hence, 
\begin{align}
    &j(\alpha(s))= \frac{12 (\mu -4)}{\alpha (s)}+\frac{(\mu -21) \mu +50}{\alpha
   (s)^2}-\frac{2 (\mu -3) (\mu -2) (\mu -1)}{\alpha (s)^3}+10. \label{Jerk}
\end{align}
Figure \ref{fig:JerkFractional} is represented the jerk for the $\Lambda$CDM model (red dashed line) and the Fractional cosmological model (solid blue line) as a function of the redshift $z$. The figure is obtained using the best-fit values for the SNe Ia+OHD data presented in Table \ref{tab:bestfits} with an error band at $3\sigma$ CL, represented by a shaded region. A departure of more than $3\sigma$ of CL for the current value for $\Lambda$CDM shows an alternative cosmology with an effective dynamical equation of state for the Universe for late times in contrast to $\Lambda$CDM.

On the other hand, for the reconstruction of the $\mathbf{\mathbb{H}}0(z)$ diagnostic \citep{H0diagnostic:2021} for the Fractional Cosmology, we define 
\begin{align}
    \mathbf{\mathbb{H}}0(z)= \frac{H(z)}{\sqrt{\Omega_{m,0}(1+z)^{3}+1-\Omega_{m,0}}}. \label{HH00diagnostic}
\end{align}
where the Hubble parameter is obtained numerically by $H(z)=H_{th}(z)$ as we explained before. Therefore, in Figure \ref{fig:H0diagnostic}, we depict $\mathbf{\mathbb{H}}0$ diagnostic for the $\Lambda$CDM model (red dashed line) and the Fractional cosmological model (solid blue line) as a function of the redshift $z$. The figure is obtained using the best-fit values for the SNe Ia+OHD data presented in Table \ref{tab:bestfits}, with an error band at $3\sigma$ CL, represented by a shaded region. As a reminder, in both Figures \ref{fig:JerkFractional} and \ref{fig:H0diagnostic}, we also depict the jerk and the $\mathbf{\mathbb{H}}0$ diagnostic for the $\Lambda$CDM model as a reference model.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{Sect:IX}
In this paper, we investigated the cosmological applications of power-law solutions of the types $a=(t/t_0)^{\alpha_0}$ in fractional cosmology, where $\alpha_0=t_0 H_0$ is the current age parameter. Additionally, given $\mu$,  the order of the fractional derivative, and $w$, the matter equation of state, we have imposed compatibility conditions which give the possible $(\mu, w)$-values that make them solutions. That means that any solution of power-law type is indeed a particular exact solution of the system, e.g., solution \eqref{3} for $\rho=0$, 
solution \eqref{17} for dust matter and $\alpha$ defined by \eqref{zeta}, the solutions $H_{1,2}$ defined by \eqref{solH-1} with  $\alpha_\pm$ defined by \eqref{apm-1}, and the compatibility conditions  \eqref{compatibility_1}
and \eqref{compatibility_2} are satisfied simultaneously for $\mu$ and $w$, and the solution \eqref{exactRicatti22} such that $\mu$ and $w$ satisfies \eqref{compatibility_21} and \eqref{compatibility_22} simultaneously. However, they are not the general solution. Moreover, we are interested in an exact solution that gives the general solution of the system. For this purpose,  one has solved a Riccati Equation \eqref{Riccati} independent of the EoS, where the solution for the scale factor is a combination of power-law,  say \eqref{V}.  This solution is analyzed in section \ref{Gen_Sol_H}. 

Finally, combining a solution of Bernoulli’s equation \eqref{eqm}, the inequality \eqref{ineq}, solving the differential inequality \eqref{eqN}, and approximating the different quadrature, we have obtained the approximate analytical solution  $E_{\text{approx}}(z)$ given by \eqref{Ez}, and $t_{\text{approx}}(z)$ given by \eqref{tz} as $z\rightarrow -1$, where $\alpha_0$ es defined by \eqref{alpha_0}, 
$A$ is defined by \eqref{(EQ140)}, satisfying the inequality \eqref{inequality}, and $m_0= \alpha_0^2-A^2$. This is an accurate approximation of $E(z)$ as $z\rightarrow -1$ provided  $2\leq \mu \leq \frac{1}{10} \left(63+\sqrt{849}\right)\lesssim 9.21376$.



Finally, using cosmological data, we estimate the free parameters $(\alpha_0, \mu)$. Using the re-parameterization $H_{0}=100\frac{\text{km/s}}{\text{Mpc}}h$,  $\alpha_0=  \frac{1}{6} \left(9 -2 \mu +\sqrt{8 \mu  (2 \mu -9)+105}\right)(1+ 2 \epsilon_0)$. 

The analysis from the SNe Ia data, OHD and the joint analysis with data from SNe Ia + OHD leads respectively to $h=0.696_{-0.295}^{+0.302}$, $\mu=1.340_{-0.339}^{+2.651}$ and  $\epsilon_0=\left(1.976_{-2.067}^{+1.709}\right)\times 10^{-2}$,   $h=0.675_{-0.021}^{+0.041}$, $\mu=2.239_{-1.190}^{+1.386}$ and $\epsilon_0=\left(0.865_{-0.773}^{+0.793}\right)\times 10^{-2}$, and  $h=0.684_{-0.027}^{+0.031}$, $\mu=1.840_{-0.773}^{+1.446}$ and $\epsilon_0=\left(1.213_{-1.057}^{+0.482}\right)\times 10^{-2}$, where the best-fit values are calculated at $3\sigma$ CL. On the other hand, these best-fit values lead to an age of the Universe with a value of $t_0=\alpha_0/H_0=25.62_{-4.46}^{+6.89}\;\text{Gyrs}$, a current deceleration parameter of $q_{0}=-0.37_{-0.11}^{+0.08}$, both at $3\sigma$ CL, and a current matter density parameter of $\Omega_{m,0}=0.531_{-0.260}^{+0.195}$ at $1\sigma$ CL. Finding a Universe roughly twice older as the one of $\Lambda$CDM is a distinction of Fractional Cosmology. Focusing our analysis on these results, we can conclude that the region in which $\mu>2$ is not ruled out by observations. This region of a parameter is relevant because, in the absence of matter, fractional cosmology gives a power-law solution $a(t)= \left(t/t_0\right)^{\mu-1}$, which is accelerated for $\mu>2$. We presented a fractional origin model that leads to an accelerated state without appealing to $\Lambda$ or Dark Energy.

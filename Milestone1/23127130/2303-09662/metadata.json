    "abstract": "Moiré superlattices formed from twisting trilayers of graphene are an ideal model for studying electronic correlation, and offer several advantages over bilayer analogues, including more robust and tunable superconductivity and a wide range of twist angles associated with flat band formation. Atomic reconstruction, which strongly impacts the electronic structure of twisted graphene structures, has been suggested to play a major role in the relative versatility of superconductivity in trilayers. Here, we exploit an inteferometric 4D-STEM approach to image a wide range of trilayer graphene structures. Our results unveil a considerably different model for moiré lattice relaxation in trilayers than that proposed from previous measurements, informing a thorough understanding of how reconstruction modulates the atomic stacking symmetries crucial for establishing superconductivity and other correlated phases in twisted graphene trilayers.",

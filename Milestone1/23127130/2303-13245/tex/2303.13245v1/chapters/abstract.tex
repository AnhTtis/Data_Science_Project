% In recent years, self-supervised learning (SSL) has profoundly shaken the foundations of machine learning; yielding more generalizable features and in some scenarios outperforming its supervised counterpart. Nonetheless and as far as visual representations are concerned, the merits of SSL are essentially built around learning image-level representation on a highly curated object-centric dataset: ImageNet. The potential of SSL as a pre-training for dense downstream tasks from realistic images is yet to be unleashed. We take a step in that direction and propose a novel \textbf{Cr}oss view \textbf{O}nline \textbf{C}lustering for dense visual representation learning scheme, dubbed $\mname$. $\mname$ fully embraces the data-driven paradigm and generates online pseudo-semantic labels with minor overhead. The versatility of the resulting algorithm is verified with scene-centric pre-training datasets, COCO and COOC+, yielding comparable or better results than other state-of-the-art methods trained on ImageNet on various dense downstream tasks.
Learning dense visual representations without labels is an arduous task and more so from scene-centric data. We propose to tackle this challenging problem by proposing a \textbf{Cr}oss-view consistency objective with an \textbf{O}nline \textbf{C}lustering mechanism (CrOC) to discover and segment the semantics of the views. In the absence of hand-crafted priors, the resulting method is more generalizable and does not require a cumbersome pre-processing step. More importantly, the clustering algorithm conjointly operates on the features of both views, thereby elegantly bypassing the issue of content not represented in both views and the ambiguous matching of objects from one crop to the other. We demonstrate excellent performance on linear and unsupervised segmentation transfer tasks on various datasets and similarly for video object segmentation.

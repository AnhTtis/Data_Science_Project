 abstract = {Quantitative asset allocation models have not played the important role they should in global portfolio management. A good part of the problem is that such models are difficult to use and tend to result in portfolios that are badly behaved. Consideration of the global CAPM equilibrium can significantly improve the usefulness of these models. In particular, equilibrium returns for equities, bonds and currencies provide neutral starting points for estimating the set of expected excess returns needed to drive the portfolio optimization process. This set of neutral weights can then be tilted in accordance with the investor's views. If the investor has no particular views about asset returns, he can use the neutral values given by the equilibrium model. If the investor does have one or more views about the relative performances of assets, or their absolute performances, he can adjust equilibrium values in accordance with those views. Furthermore, the investor can control how strongly a particular view influences portfolio weights, in accordance with the degree of confidence with which he holds the view.},

abstract = {Finding a solution to a problem often amounts to an optimization problem and thus can be recast in terms of the lowest-energy state of a system. To find such ground states, mathematical methods based on annealing were developed. To reach the ground state more quickly than with the earlier classical methods, a quantum-mechanical approach was proposed; however, the evidence for quantum speed-up is contradictory. Heim et al. show that the results depend on how the problem is described and how the optimization routine is implemented. This development should be valuable for benchmarking quantum machines. Science, this issue p. 215 For quantum machines to have a competitive advantage, they have to be posed the right question. Quantum annealers use quantum fluctuations to escape local minima and find low-energy configurations of a physical system. Strong evidence for superiority of quantum annealing (QA) has come from comparing QA implemented through quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations to classical annealing. Motivated by recent experiments, we revisit the question of when quantum speedup may be expected. Although a better scaling is seen for QA in two-dimensional Ising spin glasses, this advantage is due to time discretization artifacts and measurements that are not possible on a physical quantum annealer. Simulations in the physically relevant continuous time limit, on the other hand, do not show superiority. Our results imply that care must be taken when using QMC simulations to assess the potential for quantum speedup.}}

ABSTRACT={We provide Ising formulations for many NP-complete and NP-hard problems, including all of Karp's 21 NP-complete problems. This collects and extends mappings to the Ising model from partitioning, covering, and satisfiability. In each case, the required number of spins is at most cubic in the size of the problem. This work may be useful in designing adiabatic quantum optimization algorithms.}

abstract={In this work, we investigate the capabilities of a hybrid quantum-classical procedure to explore the solution space using the D-Wave 2000QTM quantum annealer device. Here, we study the ability of the quantum hardware to solve the number partitioning problem, a well-known NP-hard optimization model that poses some challenges typical of those encountered in real-world applications. This represents one of the most complex scenario in terms of qubits connectivity and, by increasing the input problem size, we analyze the scaling properties of the quantum-classical workflow. We find remarkable results in most instances of the model; for the most complex ones, we investigate further the D-Wave Hybrid suite. Specifically, we were able to find the optimal solutions even in the worst cases by fine-tuning the parameters that schedule the annealing time and allowing a pause in the annealing cycle.},

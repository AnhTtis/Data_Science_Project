    "abstract": "This paper is devoted to the problems of ontology-based mathematical knowledge management and representation. The main attention is paid to the development of a formal model for the representation of mathematical statements in the Open Linked Data cloud. The proposed model is intended for applications that extract mathematical facts from natural language mathematical texts and represent these facts as Linked Open Data. The model is used in development of a new version of the OntoMath${}^{\\mathrm{PRO}}$ ontology of professional mathematics is described. OntoMath${}^{\\mathrm{PRO}}$ underlies a semantic publishing platform, that takes as an input a collection of mathematical papers in LaTeX format and builds their ontology-based Linked Open Data representation. The semantic publishing platform, in turn, is a central component of OntoMath digital ecosystem, an ecosystem of ontologies, text analytics tools, and applications for mathematical knowledge management, including semantic search for mathematical formulas and a recommender system for mathematical papers. According to the new model, the ontology is organized into three layers: a foundational ontology layer, a domain ontology layer and a linguistic layer. The domain ontology layer contains language-independent math concepts. The linguistic layer provides linguistic grounding for these concepts, and the foundation ontology layer provides them with meta-ontological annotations. The concepts are organized in two main hierarchies: the hierarchy of objects and the hierarchy of reified relationships.",

    "abstract": "Controlling magnetic anisotropy (MA) is important in a variety of applications including magnetic memories, spintronic sensors, and skyrmion-based data distribution. The perovskite manganite family provides a fertile playground for complex, intricate, and potentially useful structure-magnetism relations. Here we report on the MA that emerges in 10% Ru substituted $La_{0.7}Sr_{0.3}MnO_{3}$ (Ru-LSMO) films for which strong perpendicular magnetization and anisotropic in-plane magnetization are found. These moderately compressively strained films possess a rich microstructure, consisting of coherently strained phase which evolves into a one dimensional (1D) periodically-modulated structure above a critical thickness. We illustrate how 10% Ru substitution plays a crucial role behind the observed MA, and how the structural distortion and 1D periodic structural modulation produce the anisotropic in-plane magnetization. We highlight the practical significance of the observed MA, which could pave the way towards the realization of cutting-edge oxide-based room temperature spintronic memory devices.",

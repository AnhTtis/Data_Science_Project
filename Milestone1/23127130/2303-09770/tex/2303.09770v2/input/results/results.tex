In this section, we describe the experiments conducted on the engineering graph-design problem dataset from \sref{case}.
The tools and computing architecture are described in App.~\ref{appa} \cite{gdlgithub}.
% \footnote{The dataset and code will be made available. \vspace{0.0in}}

% we converted each circuit graph to a PyG instance with its associated node features and graph label.

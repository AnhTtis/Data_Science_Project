% \subsection{Case Study: Electric Circuit Frequency Response Matching Graph-design Problem}

To explore the capabilities of GDL in graph-based engineering design problems, we utilize the results of a frequency response matching study \cite{b5}.
The dataset and code to replicate these studies are available at Ref.~\cite{gdlgithub}.

% However, like many problems of this nature, it is both complex and expensive. 
% The successful synthesis of fully defined analog circuits involves decisions related to both the topology and sizing of the components, but the issue is that synthesis methods must navigate the enormous design space within these particular problems \cite{b47}, which leads researchers to be unable to find the best solutions efficiently. 
% As a result, most attempted solutions to these problems have aimed to navigate the immense design space by sampling from the complete design space.

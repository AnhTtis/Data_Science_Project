\label{intro}
Mathematical graphs can be used to represent many systems and decisions because of their ability to capture discrete compositional and relational information. 
For decades, studies have employed different graph representations to capture their respective problems \cite{b5, b6, b37, b95, b96, b97}, and for well over a century, researchers have utilized graph enumeration to understand engineering design problems to help in decision making \cite{b3, b59, b6, b37, b38}. 
Today, many engineering design problems, including the construction of the ``system architecture'', are increasing in scope and complexity to a point where traditional discrete and continuous presentations are insufficient to represent the system \cite{b6}.

System architecture is a conceptual model capturing the structure, behavior, rules, etc., of a product, process, or element \cite{b18} and is often the foundation on which it is designed, built, and operated. 
Many studies have concentrated on the effective representation of system architectures using graph theory \cite{b29, b91, b92}, where the goal is often a set of useful architectures that are feasible with respect to constraints.
Furthermore, one or more value metrics (e.g.,~performance or cost) might be determined for the different architectures so that the designer might sort through the candidates.
One method for generating all of these options is graph enumeration, where a complete and ordered listing of the potential graphs is produced for some prescribed structure \cite{b3, b30, b31}.
However, this approach can lead to an enormous amount of potential design solutions depending on the problem at hand and its selected representation.
Paired with the increasing complexity of modern systems, the result is an exponential increase in computational costs making the decision-making process for the designer or system architect increasingly challenging.
These challenges drive the need for an approach that facilitates the decision-making for larger and more complex graph-centric design problems.

In this paper, we consider deep learning, specifically \textit{Geometric Deep Learning (GDL)}, as a potential strategy to address these issues.
Deep learning is defined as machine learning models composed of multiple processing layers capable of learning data representations with multiple levels of abstraction \cite{b21}, and
``deep'' refers to a larger number of hidden layers within the neural network. 
Now, GDL is an umbrella term encompassing an emerging technique that generalizes neural networks to Euclidean and non-Euclidean domains, such as graphs, manifolds, meshes, or string representations \cite{b19}, and uses \textit{Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)}.
In essence, GDL encompasses approaches that incorporate information on the input variables' structure space and symmetry properties and leverage it to improve the quality of the data captured by the model. 
GDL has immense potential and is widely used in other scientific communities, including molecular representations \cite{b20, b23, b24}, materials science \cite{b25}, architecture \cite{b28}, and the medical field \cite{b26, b27}.

Here we are particularly motivated by graphic-centric design problems where generating many potential graphs is feasible, but determining the value or performance of each option is too expensive.
The proposed approach outlined in this article uses GDL to reduce the computational expense of classifying what might be ``good'' or ``bad'' options with a trade-off in classification accuracy.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows:
Section~\ref{background} discusses the necessary background information required to have a basic understanding of GDL.
In \sref{method}, we go over the proposed approach, including graph classification, the machine learning model, and the metrics used to determine the performance of the models.
Section~\ref{case} discusses the case study on electric circuit frequency response
matching graph design, and \sref{results} describes several experiments conducted to explore GDL on this problem.
Lastly, we conclude in \sref{conclusion} with the final discussions and future work.

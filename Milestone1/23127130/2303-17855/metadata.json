    "abstract": "A recent article on generalised linear mixed model asymptotics, Jiang et al. (2022), derived the rates of convergence for the asymptotic variances of maximum likelihood estimators. If $m$ denotes the number of groups and $n$ is the average within-group sample size then the asymptotic variances have orders $m^{-1}$ and $(mn)^{-1}$, depending on the parameter. We extend this theory to provide explicit forms of the $(mn)^{-1}$ second terms of the asymptotically harder-to-estimate parameters. Improved accuracy of studentised confidence intervals is one consequence of our theory.",

    "abstract": "A detailed study of small-scale Hall magnetohydrodynamic dynamo has been performed both analytically and numerically. Assuming the magnetic field and the current to be separate fields, the contribution of the Hall term has been decomposed into two parts and their individual contributions have been studied separately. Calculating the scale-separated transfer rates described in Dar \\textit{et. al.} (Physica D, 157 (207), 2001), it is found that the small-scale current fields are the primary contributors in sustaining large scale magnetic fields. Furthermore, the nature of the scale-to-scale fluxes are found to be globally intact with the ion inertial scale.",

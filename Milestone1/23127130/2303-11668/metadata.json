    "abstract": "In recent years, monitoring the world wide area with satellite images has been emerged as an important issue.\n  Site monitoring task can be divided into two independent tasks; 1) Change Detection and 2) Anomaly Event Detection.\n  Unlike to change detection research is actively conducted based on the numerous datasets(\\eg LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, S2Looking, xView2 and etc...) to meet up the expectations of industries or governments, research on AI models for detecting anomaly events is passively and rarely conducted.\n  In this paper, we introduce a novel satellite imagery dataset(AED-RS) for detecting anomaly events on the open public places.\n  AED-RS Dataset contains satellite images of normal and abnormal situations of 8 open public places from all over the world.\n  Each places are labeled with different criteria based on the difference of characteristics of each places.\n  With this dataset, we introduce a baseline model for our dataset TB-FLOW, which can be trained in weakly-supervised manner and shows reasonable performance on the AED-RS Dataset compared with the other NF(Normalizing-Flow) based anomaly detection models. Our dataset and code will be publicly open in \\url{https://github.com/SIAnalytics/RS_AnomalyDetection.git}.",

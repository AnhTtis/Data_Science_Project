This distribution has the important property that one tail has polynomial and the other exponential behavior. Further, it is the only subclass of the GH family of distributions having this property. Although the GH skew Student’s t-distribution has been previously proposed in the literature, it is not well known, and specifically, its special tail behavior has not been addressed. This article presents empirical evidence of exponential/polynomial tail behavior in skew financial data, and demonstrates the superiority of the GH skew Student’s t-distribution with respect to data fit compared with some of its competitors. Through VaR and expected shortfall calculations we show why the exponential/polynomial tail behavior is important in practice.}",

 abstract = {The normal inverse Gaussian distribution is defined as a variance-mean mixture of a normal distribution with the inverse Gaussian as the mixing distribution. The distribution determines an homogeneous Lévy process, and this process is representable through subordination of Brownian motion by the inverse Gaussian process. The canonical, Lévy type, decomposition of the process is determined. As a preparation for developments in the latter part of the paper the connection of the normal inverse Gaussian distribution to the classes of generalized hyperbolic and inverse Gaussian distributions is briefly reviewed. Then a discussion is begun of the potential of the normal inverse Gaussian distribution and Lévy process for modelling and analysing statistical data, with particular reference to extensive sets of observations from turbulence and from finance. These areas of application imply a need for extending the inverse Gaussian Lévy process so as to accommodate certain, frequently observed, temporal dependence structures. Some extensions, of the stochastic volatility type, are constructed via an observation-driven approach to state space modelling. At the end of the paper generalizations to multivariate settings are indicated.},

abstract={In this paper novel simulation methods are provided for the generalised inverse Gaussian (GIG) L{\'e}vy process. Such processes are intractable for simulation except in certain special edge cases, since the L{\'e}vy density associated with the GIG process is expressed as an integral involving certain Bessel functions, known as the Jaeger integral in diffusive transport applications. We here show for the first time how to solve the problem indirectly, using generalised shot-noise methods to simulate the underlying point processes and constructing an auxiliary variables approach that avoids any direct calculation of the integrals involved. The resulting augmented bivariate process is still intractable and so we propose a novel thinning method based on upper bounds on the intractable integrand. Moreover, our approach leads to lower and upper bounds on the Jaeger integral itself, which may be compared with other approximation methods. The shot noise method involves a truncated infinite series of decreasing random variables, and as such is approximate, although the series are found to be rapidly convergent in most cases. We note that the GIG process is the required Brownian motion subordinator for the generalised hyperbolic (GH) L{\'e}vy process and so our simulation approach will straightforwardly extend also to the simulation of these intractable processes. Our new methods will find application in forward simulation of processes of GIG and GH type, in financial and engineering data, for example, as well as inference for states and parameters of stochastic processes driven by GIG and GH L{\'e}vy processes.},

In a short time frame it is close to an $\alpha$-stable process while in a long time frame it approximates a Brownian motion. In this paper we consider a general and robust class of multivariate tempered stable distributions and establish their identifiable parametrization. We prove short and long time behavior of tempered stable {L}évy processes and investigate their absolute continuity with respect to the underlying $\alpha$-stable processes. We find probabilistic representations of tempered stable processes which specifically show how such processes are obtained by cutting (tempering) jumps of stable processes. These representations exhibit $\alpha$-stable and Gaussian tendencies in tempered stable processes and thus give probabilistic intuition for their study. Such representations can also be used for simulation. We also develop the corresponding representations for Ornstein–Uhlenbeck-type processes.}

abstract = {Non-Gaussian processes of Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) type offer the possibility of capturing important distributional deviations from Gaussianity and for flexible modelling of dependence structures. This paper develops this potential, drawing on and extending powerful results from probability theory for applications in statistical analysis. Their power is illustrated by a sustained application of OU processes within the context of finance and econometrics. We construct continuous time stochastic volatility models for financial assets where the volatility processes are superpositions of positive OU processes, and we study these models in relation to financial data and theory.},

abstract="In recent years more realistic stochastic models for price movements in financial markets have been developed by replacing the classical Brownian motion by L{\'e}vy processes. Among these generalized hyperbolic L{\'e}vy processes turned out to provide an excellent fit to observed market data. We review the most important facts of the generating distributions and give a detailed derivation of its limits including some well known distributions which also have been applied to financial data. All these are subclasses of extended generalized {\'{N}}-convolutions. This fact allows the explicit calculation of characteristic triplets and the construction of uan convergent triangular schemes, whereas classical multinomial approximations are shown to fail in this context. The mixing generalized inverse {Gaussian} distributions are also considered.",

  Abstract                 = {A regression-type method of estimating the four parameters of a stable distribution is presented. The estimators found are consistent and approximately unbiased for moderately large sample sizes. Their efficiencies, found through a simulation study, are greater than those of most other estimators for large portions of the parameter space. Moreover, the amount of computation involved is minimal and apparently less than that needed by the methods of Paulson, Holcomb, and Leitch (1975) and of maximum likelihood (DuMouchel 1971). Finally, this method is applied to stock price data from four corporations.},

The problem of the discontinuity of the traditional location parameter in the asymmetrical cases as a passes unity is resolved. The proposed estimators of a and c are similar to those of Fama and Roll, except that the small asymptotic bias in their estimators has been eliminated, and their restrictions that a be no less than 1.0 and that the distribution be symmetrical have been relaxed. The proposed estimators can provide good initialization values for other more efficient, but computer-intensive, methods.},

  Abstract                 = {It is well known that the α-stable distribution, while having no closed form density function in the general case, admits a Poisson series representation (PSR) in which the terms of the series are a function of the arrival times of a unit rate Poisson process. In our previous work we have shown how to carry out inference for regression models using this series representation, which leads to a very convenient conditionally {Gaussian} framework, amenable to straightforward {Gaussian} inference procedures. The PSR has to be truncated to a finite number of terms for practical purposes. The residual terms have been approximated in our previous work by a {Gaussian} distribution with fully characterised moments. In this paper we present a new Central Limit Theorem (CLT) for the residual terms which serves to justify our previous approximation of the residual as {Gaussian}. Furthermore, we provide an analysis of the asymptotic convergence rate expressed in the CLT.}

 abstract = {{This book gives an introduction to the basic theory of stochastic calculus and its applications. Examples are given throughout the text, in order to motivate and illustrate the theory and show its importance for many applications in e.g. economics, biology and physics. The basic idea of the presentation is to start from some basic results (without proofs) of the easier cases and develop the theory from there, and to concentrate on the proofs of the easier case (which nevertheless are often sufficiently general for many purposes) in order to be able to reach quickly the parts of the theory which is most important for the applications. For the 6th edition the author has added further exercises and, for the first time, solutions to many of the exercises are provided.}},

  abstract = 	 {The added flexibility of Student-t processes (TPs) over Gaussian processes (GPs) robustifies inference in outlier-contaminated noisy data. The uncertainties are better accounted for than in GP regression, because the predictive covariances explicitly depend on the training observations. For an entangled noise model, the canonical-form TP regression problem can be solved analytically, but the naive TP and GP solutions share the same cubic computational cost in the number of training observations. We show how a large class of temporal TP regression models can be reformulated as state space models, and how a forward filtering and backward smoothing recursion can be derived for solving the inference analytically in linear time complexity. This is a novel finding that generalizes the previously known connection between Gaussian process regression and Kalman filtering to more general elliptical processes and non-Gaussian Bayesian filtering. We derive this connection, demonstrate the benefits of the approach with examples, and finally apply the method to empirical data.}

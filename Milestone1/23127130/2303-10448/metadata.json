    "abstract": "Antiferromagnetic (AF) spintronics is merit on ultra-high operator speed and stability in the presence of magnetic field. To fully use the merit, the device should be pure rather than hybrid with ferromagnet or ferrimagnet. For the magnetism in the antiferromagnet is canceled by that of different sublattices, breaking the symmetry in the material can revive the native magnetism, which can be detected by the magnetoresistance (MR) effect. Achieving noticeable MR effect in the pure AF device is diffcult but essential for the AF spintronic applications. Here, we study the tunnel magnetoresistance(TMR) effect in the Nb/Mn$_2$Au/CdO/Mn$_2$Au/Nb pure AF magnetic tunnel junctions (AF-MTJs) based on a first-principle scattering theory. Giant TMRs with order of 1000% are predicted in some symmetric junctions, which is originated from the interfacial resonance tunneling effect related with the k dependent complex band structures of CdO and Mn$_2$Au in companion with the enhanced spin polarization of the interfacial magnetic atoms. The effect of voltage bias and interfacial disorder such as Oxygen vacancy, Manganese vacancy, and Manganese-Cadmium exchanges at Mn2Au/CdO interfaces are studied also. Our studies suggest Nb/Mn$_2$Au/CdO/Mn$_2$Au/Nb AFMTJs promising material for AF spintronic application, and rocksalt CdO a potential symmetry filtering material for spintronic applications.",

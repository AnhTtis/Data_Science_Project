    "abstract": "Due to the long coherence time and efficient manipulation, the surface electron (SE) provides a perfect two-dimensional platform for quantum computation and quantum simulation. In this work, a theoretical scheme to realize the controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate is proposed, where the two-qubit system is encoded on the four-level Rydberg structure of SE. The state transfer is achieved by a three-level structure with an intermediate level. By simultaneously driving the SE with two external electromagnetic fields, the dark state in the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) effect is exploited to suppress the population of the most dissipative state and increase the robustness against dissipation. The fidelity of the scheme is 0.9989 with experimentally achievable parameters.",

\cite{Mangum+2019}, the \texttt{CubeLineMoment} masking process uses a brighter spectral line, whose velocity structure over the galaxy is most representative of our science target lines (HNCO and SiO) in the same spectral cube, as a velocity tracer of the gas component inspected. 

\subsubsection{Outer CMZ: GMC 1a/2b/8a/9a}
Except for GMC 1a, the general trend is that HNCO tends to trace intermediate gas density ($\sim 10^4$ cm\textsuperscript{-3}) and cooler gas components ($T_{\rm kin}$ $<100$ K). 
HNCO in GMC 1a points to low-density ($n_{\rm H2}\sim10^{3}$ cm\textsuperscript{-3}) and warm ($T\geq200$ K) gas. 
On the other hand, SiO always traces low-density gas  ($n_{\rm H2}<10^{3}$ cm\textsuperscript{-3}) at high gas temperature ($T>200$ K), especially for the outermost GMCs (1a and 9a), where the gas is hot (T $>400$ K). 
Hence, as traced by SiO, the gas properties seem to point to shocked gas for they are all warm or hot, possibly due to shock heating. 

Based on the previous chemical modeling in \citet{Kelly+2017}, if the gas density is low ($n_{\rm H2}<10^{4}$ cm\textsuperscript{-3}) HNCO can only arise from the sputtering of icy mantles due to a weak shock; while for denser ($n_{\rm H2}\geq10^{4}$ cm\textsuperscript{-3}) gas thermal sublimation can also lead to HNCO enhancement. 
However, for the latter to occur the kinetic gas temperature must be close to  the critical temperature for HNCO sublimation.
\citet{Fedoseev+2015} reported  a desorption temperature for HNCO of around 185 K, which is well above T $<100$ K probed by HNCO in GMC 2b/4/6/7/8a/9a. 
This suggests even if the gas density is sufficiently high, the temperature is not high enough to thermally sublimate HNCO back into the gas phase.
In Section \ref{sec:chem_model}, we further revisit this argument via chemical modelling. 

\subsubsection{Inner CMZ: GMC 3/6, GMC 4, and GMC 7}
\label{sec:radex_innerGMC}
HNCO in GMC 3 and GMC6 points to a higher gas density ($10^{5-6}$ cm\textsuperscript{-3}) and slightly warmer gas component ($T>50-100$ K). 
Caution needs to be taken in interpreting our HNCO observations in GMC3, as although it appears that both gas density and gas temperature are constrained, in reality the $n_{\rm H2}$ peak and $T_{\rm kin}$ peak point to two degenerated sets of solutions. 
These values for GMC 3 traced by HNCO are listed with best likelihood. 
On the other hand, the HNCO column density in GMC 3 is  tightly constrained. 
SiO in GMC 3 and 6  points to intermediate densities ($\sim10^{4}$ cm\textsuperscript{-3}) and hot ($T>500$ K) gas. 
In the case of GMC 4, HNCO  points to denser ($10^{6}$ cm\textsuperscript{-3}) and cooler ($50<T<100$ K) gas, while SiO points to an intermediate-density and, again, hot gas. 
The inferred HNCO column densities ($N_{\rm HNCO}$) in GMC3/6 are about two times higher than the HNCO column density in GMC 4. 

%\subsubsection{Inner CMZ: GMC 7}
Finally, for GMC 7, HNCO points to a denser ($\sim10^6$ cm\textsuperscript{-3}) and very cold ($T\sim20$ K) gas component. And this sets GMC 7 apart from GMC 3, 4, and 6. 
SiO, on the other hand, again traces low-density ($\sim 10^3$ cm\textsuperscript{-3}) and very hot ($T>500$ K) gas.

	abstract = {We show that typical implicit regularization assumptions for deep neural networks (for regression) do not hold for coordinate-MLPs, a family of MLPs that are now ubiquitous in computer vision for representing high-frequency signals. Lack of such implicit bias disrupts smooth interpolations between training samples, and hampers generalizing across signal regions with different spectra. We investigate this behavior through a Fourier lens and uncover that as the bandwidth of a coordinate-MLP is enhanced, lower frequencies tend to get suppressed unless a suitable prior is provided explicitly. Based on these insights, we propose a simple regularization technique that can mitigate the above problem, which can be incorporated into existing networks without any architectural modifications.},

	abstract = {In theory, the pose of a calibrated camera can be uniquely determined from a minimum of four coplanar but noncollinear points. In practice, there are many applications of camera pose tracking from planar targets and there is also a number of recent pose estimation algorithms which perform this task in real-time, but all of these algorithms suffer from pose ambiguities. This paper investigates the pose ambiguity for planar targets viewed by a perspective camera. We show that pose ambiguities—two distinct local minima of the according error function—exist even for cases with wide angle lenses and close range targets. We give a comprehensive interpretation of the two minima and derive an analytical solution that locates the second minimum. Based on this solution, we develop a new algorithm for unique and robust pose estimation from a planar target. In the experimental evaluation, this algorithm outperforms four state-of-the-art pose estimation algorithms.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new method for the computation of the position and orientation of a camera with respect to a known object, using four or morecoplanarfeature points. Starting with the scaled orthographic projection approximation, this method iteratively refines up to two different pose estimates, and provides an associated quality measure for each pose. When the camera distance is large compared with the object depth, or when the accuracy of feature point extraction is low because of image noise, the quality measures for the two poses are similar, and the two pose estimates are plausible interpretations of the available information. In contrast, known methods using a closed form pose solution for four coplanar points are not robust for distant objects in the presence of image noise because they provide only one of the two possible poses and may choose the wrong pose.},

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the Shannon entropy of the total system and its subsystems, as well as the subsystem Shannon mutual information, in quasiparticle excited states of free bosonic and fermionic chains and the ferromagnetic phase of the spin-1/2 XXX chain. Our focus is on single-particle and double-particle states, and we derive various analytical formulas for free bosonic and fermionic chains in the scaling limit. These formulas are also applicable to magnon excited states in the XXX chain under certain conditions. We discover that, unlike entanglement entropy, Shannon entropy does not separate when two quasiparticles have a large momentum difference. Moreover, in the large momentum difference limit, we obtain universal results for quantum spin chains that cannot be explained by a semiclassical picture of quasiparticles.",

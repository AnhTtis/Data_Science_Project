ABSTRACT = {It is generally accepted that high temperature superconductors emerge when extra carriers are introduced in the parent state, which looks like a Mott insulator. Competition of the order parameters drives the system into a poorly defined pseudogap state before acquiring the normal Fermi liquid behavior with further doping. Within the low doping level, the system has the tendency for mesoscopic phase separation, which seems to be a general characteristic in all high Tc compounds, but also in the materials of colossal magnetoresistance or the relaxor ferroelectrics. In all these systems, metastable phases can be created by tuning physical variables, such as doping or pressure, and the competing order parameters can drive the compound to various states. Structural instabilities are expected at critical points and Raman spectroscopy is ideal for detecting them, since it is a very sensitive technique for detecting small lattice modifications and instabilities. In this article, phase separation and lattice distortions are examined on the most characteristic family of high temperature superconductors, the cuprates. The effect of doping or atomic substitutions on cuprates is examined concerning the induced phase separation and hydrostatic pressure for activating small local lattice distortions at the edge of lattice instability.},

abstract={We consider an approach to the derivation of thermodynamic equations of state by averaging the dynamic equations of particles of the crystal lattice. Microscopic analogs of macroscopic variables such as pressure, volume, and thermal energy are introduced. An analysis of the introduced variables together with the equations of motion permits obtaining the equation of state. Earlier, this approach was used to obtain the equation of state in the Mie-Gr{\"u}neisen form for a one-dimensional lattice. The aim of this paper is to develop and generalize this approach to the three-dimensional case. As a result, we obtain the dependence of the Gr{\"u}neisen function on the volume, which is compared with the computations performed according to well-known models with experimental data taken into account. It is proved that the Gr{\"u}neisen coefficient substantially depends on the form of the strain state. Moreover, we refine the equation of state; namely, we show that the Gr{\"u}neisen coefficient depends on the thermal energy, but this dependence in the three-dimensional case is much weaker than in the one-dimensional case. A refined equation of state containing a nonlinear dependence on the thermal energy is obtained},

They presented equations for γ that were commonly used at that time and pointed out that these equations were marred because they apparently did not account for the effect of two important properties, shear displacement and dispersion (frequency versus wavenumber). I review the progress in research on γ for the past 30 years and show what has been done to overcome or bypass these two defects. I also show that the experimental database has increased sufficiently to test a basic assumption in the Mie–Grüneisen equation of state (EoS) derivation, namely that γ is independent of T. The basic assumption should be that γ is independent of T at constant V, and many solids fail this test in that (∂γ/∂T)V is not zero. This weakens the assumption that the Mie–Grüneisen EoS can be used reliably at high T without a careful check. The main progress, made for closely packed solids, is in the determination of γ for the lower mantle and the core. Little progress has been made for loosely packed solids, so the value of γ for the upper mantle and the lithosphere is still an open question.}",

The second- or third-order elastic constants and the long-wavelength acoustic mode Grüneisen parameter are calculated. The results reveal that all metallic glasses have positive pressure dependences of both the longitudinal and shear velocities, while for most non-metallic glasses both the longitudinal and shear velocities decrease with increasing pressure. Thus, the Grüneisen parameters evaluated for the mean mode and shear mode for metallic glasses and non-metallic glasses have opposite signs. This indicates that the influences of the short-range-order structure and bonding, correlating closely with the atomic configurations in the various amorphous materials, play an important role in the properties determined by vibrational anharmonicity. The negative and positive Grüneisen parameters exhibit mode softening and stiffness under high pressure, respectively. The results also clearly demonstrate that the Grüneisen parameter is affected by the pressure derivative of the shear modulus, especially for non-metallic glasses.}

abstract={Hydrogen, being the first element in the periodic table, has the simplest electronic structure of any atom, and the hydrogen molecule contains the simplest covalent chemical bond. Nevertheless, the phase diagram of hydrogen is poorly understood. Determining the stable structures of solid hydrogen is a tremendous experimental challenge1,2,3, because hydrogen atoms scatter X-rays only weakly, leading to low-resolution diffraction patterns. Theoretical studies encounter major difficulties owing to the small energy differences between structures and the importance of the zero-point motion of the protons. We have systematically investigated the zero-temperature phase diagram of solid hydrogen using first-principles density functional theory (DFT) electronic-structure methods4, including the proton zero-point motion at the harmonic level. Our study leads to a radical revision of the DFT phase diagram of hydrogen up to nearly 400 GPa. That the most stable phases remain insulating to very high pressures eliminates a major discrepancy between theory5 and experiment6. One of our new phases is calculated to be stable over a wide range of pressures, and its vibrational properties agree with the available experimental data for phase III.},

Upon cooling, the samples show a linear decrease in resistivity, then an approximately logarithmic increase, interpreted as a beginning of localization. Finally an abrupt decrease by up to three orders of magnitude occurs, reminiscent of the onset of percolative superconductivity. The highest onset temperature is observed in the 30 K range. It is markedly reduced by high current densities. Thus, it results partially from the percolative nature, bute possibly also from 2D superconducting fluctuations of double perovskite layers of one of the phases present.},

To describe the latter, a pseudospin model of the lattice dynamics is proposed and electron-phonon interaction in ion-type crystals is considered.

The superconductivity and related properties of these metals are considered in this article. The influence of the amorphous structure on the electron and the phonon system is discussed. In simple metals the electrons show a free electron behaviour. The transverse phonons are softened but maintainn the Ï3-density of states at low frequencies. The electron-phonon interaction does not conserve momentum due to the loss of translational invariance in the amorphous metal and yields a large contribution to Î±2F(Ï) at low frequencies. Therefore the amorphous superconductors are strong coupling. The strong coupling character alters the temperature dependence of several superconducting parameters such as critical fields etc. The characteristic superconducting properties and superconducting fluctuations are discussed."

This is demonstrated for an impure simple metal by deriving the Eliashberg equation. It turns out that (1) this equation is of the same formal structure as in the clean case, (2) there exists an additional coupling of low-frequency transverse phonons to the electrons, whereas (3) the interaction between longitudinal phonons and electrons is reduced. Since the former effect is much larger than the latter, the effective phonon density of states $\alpha$2F($\omega$) is considerably enlarged in the low-frequency regime, which generally leads to an increased transition temperature and energy gap. Calculated values of the change in the transition temperature are compared for various impurity concentrations with experimental results and satisfactory agreement is obtained.",

crystals of Bi2 â xPbxSr2CaCu208 + ÎŽ.
The measurements carried out at 5 K showed a complex spatial pattern
of important variations of the local DOS on the nanometer scale.
Superconducting areas, characterized by a well-pronounced
superconducting gap, are coexisting with regions of a peakless gap
structure which we attribute to the pseudogap.
Within the large superconducting regions, the spectra reveal strong
peak/dip/hump signatures, identical to the pristine
Bi2Sr2CaCu208 + ÎŽ case.
On the contrary, in very small superconducting regions
this fine structure is attenuated. Such a behavior of the local DOS
suggests that the peak/dip/hump fine structure is not only a
consequence of the superconducting
state, but is also directly related to the scale of the phase coherence.
The role of Bi-Pb substitutional disorder is discussed.}

title = {High temperature superconductivity in the candidate phases of solid hydrogen},
journal = {Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter},
abstract = {As the simplest element in nature, unraveling the phase diagram of hydrogen is a primary task for condensed matter physics. As conjectured many decades ago, in the low-temperature and high-pressure part of the phase diagram, solid hydrogen is expected to become metallic with a high superconducting transition temperature. The metallization may occur via band gap closure in the molecular solid or via a transition to the atomic solid. Recently, a few experimental studies pushed the achievable pressures into the 400–500 GPa range. There are strong indications that at some pressure in this range metallization via either of these mechanisms occurs, although there are disagreements between experimental reports. Furthermore, there are multiple good candidate crystal phases that have emerged from recent computational and experimental studies which may be realized in upcoming experiments. Therefore, it is crucial to determine the superconducting properties of these candidate phases. In a recent study, we reported the superconducting properties of the C2/c-24 phase, which we believe to be a strong candidate for metallization via band gap closure (Dogan et al 2022 Phys. Rev. B  105 L020509). Here, we report the superconducting properties of the Cmca-12, Cmca-4 and I41/amd-2 phases including the anharmonic effects using a Wannier function-based dense k-point and q-point sampling. We find that the Cmca-12 phase has a superconducting transition temperature that rises from 86 K at 400 GPa to 212 K at 500 GPa, whereas the Cmca-4 and I41/amd-2 phases show a less pressure-dependent behavior with their T  c  in the 74–94 K and 307–343 K ranges, respectively. These properties can be used to distinguish between crystal phases in future experiments. Understanding superconductivity in pure hydrogen is also important in the study of high-T  c  hydrides.}

abstract={Anharmonic lattice vibrations play pivotal roles in the thermal dynamics in condense matters and affect how the atoms interact and conduct heat. An in-depth understanding of the microscopic mechanism of phonon anharmonicity in condensed systems is critical for developing better functional and energy materials. In recent years, various novel behaviors in condense matters driven by phonon anharmonic effects were discovered, such as soft mode phase transition, negative thermal expansion (NTE), multiferroicity, ultralow thermal conductivity ($\kappa$), high thermal resistance, and high-temperature superconductivity. These properties have endowed anharmonicity with many promising applications and provided remarkable opportunities for developing ``Anharmonicity Engineering''---regulating heat transport towards excellent performance in materials. In this work, we review the recent development of studies on phonon anharmonic effect and summarize its origin, mechanism, research methods, and applications. Besides, the remaining challenges, future trends, and prospects of phonon anharmonicity are also discussed.},

Rev.108, 1175 (1957)) is sketched for very dirty superconductors, where elastic scattering from physical and chemical impurities is large compared with the energy gap. This theory is based on pairing each one-electron state with its exact time reverse, a generalization of the k up, âk down pairing of the B.C.S. theory which is independent of such scattering. Such a theory has many qualitative and a few quantitative points of agreement with experiment, in particular with specific-heat data, energy-gap measurements, and transition-temperature versus impurity curves. Other types of pairing which have been suggested are not compatible with the existence of dirty superconductors."

pages={870-877},
abstract={The physical properties of a topologically disordered amorphous material (glass), such as heat capacity and thermal conductivity, are markedly different from those of its ordered crystalline counterpart. The understanding of these phenomena is a notoriously complex problem. One of the universal features of disordered glasses is the 'boson peak', which is observed in neutron and Raman scattering experiments. The boson peak is typically ascribed to an excess density of vibrational states. Here, we study the nature of the boson peak, using numerical simulations of several glass-forming systems. We discovered evidence suggestive of the equality of the boson peak frequency to the Ioffe-Regel limit for 'transverse' phonons, above which transverse phonons no longer propagate. Our results indicate a possibility that the origin of the boson peak is transverse vibrational modes associated with defective soft structures in the disordered state. Furthermore, we suggest a possible link between slow structural relaxation and fast boson peak dynamics in glass-forming systems.},

abstract={The discovery of superconductivity at 200 kelvin in the hydrogen sulfide system at high pressures1 demonstrated the potential of hydrogen-rich materials as high-temperature superconductors. Recent theoretical predictions of rare-earth hydrides with hydrogen cages2,3 and the subsequent synthesis of LaH10 with a superconducting critical temperature (Tc) of 250 kelvin4,5 have placed these materials on the verge of achieving the long-standing goal of room-temperature superconductivity. Electrical and X-ray diffraction measurements have revealed a weakly pressure-dependent Tc for LaH10 between 137 and 218 gigapascals in a structure that has a face-centred cubic arrangement of lanthanum atoms5. Here we show that quantum atomic fluctuations stabilize a highly symmetrical {\$}{\$}{\{}Fm{\}}{\backslash}overline{\{}3{\}}{\{}m{\}}{\$}{\$}Fm3{\textasciimacron}m crystal structure over this pressure range. The structure is consistent with experimental findings and has a very large electron--phonon coupling constant of 3.5. Although ab initio classical calculations predict that this {\$}{\$}{\{}Fm{\}}{\backslash}overline{\{}3{\}}{\{}m{\}}{\$}{\$}Fm3{\textasciimacron}m structure undergoes distortion at pressures below 230 gigapascals2,3, yielding a complex energy landscape, the inclusion of quantum effects suggests that it is the true ground-state structure. The agreement between the calculated and experimental Tc values further indicates that this phase is responsible for the superconductivity observed at 250 kelvin. The relevance of quantum fluctuations calls into question many of the crystal structure predictions that have been made for hydrides within a classical approach and that currently guide the experimental quest for room-temperature superconductivity6--8. Furthermore, we find that quantum effects are crucial for the stabilization of solids with high electron--phonon coupling constants that could otherwise be destabilized by the large electron--phonon interaction9, thus reducing the pressures required for their synthesis.},

journal={Nature Materials},
year={2021},
month={Oct},
day={04},
abstract={The properties of quantum materials are commonly tuned using experimental variables such as pressure, magnetic field and doping. Here we explore a different approach using irreversible, plastic deformation of single crystals. We show that compressive plastic deformation induces low-dimensional superconductivity well above the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of undeformed SrTiO3, with evidence of possible superconducting correlations at temperatures two orders of magnitude above the bulk Tc. The enhanced superconductivity is correlated with the appearance of self-organized dislocation structures, as revealed by diffuse neutron and X-ray scattering. We also observe deformation-induced signatures of quantum-critical ferroelectric fluctuations and inhomogeneous ferroelectric order using Raman scattering. Our results suggest that strain surrounding the self-organized dislocation structures induces local ferroelectricity and quantum-critical dynamics that strongly influence Tc, consistent with a theory of superconductivity enhanced by soft polar fluctuations. Our results demonstrate the potential of plastic deformation and dislocation engineering for the manipulation of electronic properties of quantum materials.},

abstract = {Doped SrTiO3, one of the most dilute bulk systems to display superconductivity, is perhaps the first example of an unconventional superconductor, as it does not fit into the standard BCS paradigm. More than five decades of research has revealed a rich temperature-carrier concentration phase diagram that showcases a superconducting dome, proximity to a putative quantum critical point, Lifshitz transitions, a multi-gap pairing state and unusual normal-state transport properties. Research has also extended beyond bulk SrTiO3, ushering the new field of SrTiO3-based heterostructures. Because many of these themes are also featured in other quantum materials of contemporary interest, recent years have seen renewed interest in SrTiO3. Here, we review the challenges and recent progress in elucidating the superconducting state of this model system. At the same time that its extreme dilution requires to revisit several of the approximations that constitute the successful Migdal–Eliashberg description of electron–phonon superconductivity, including the suppression of the Coulomb repulsion via the Tolmachev–Anderson–Morel mechanism, it opens interesting routes for alternative pairing mechanisms whose applicability remains under debate. For instance, pairing mechanisms involving longitudinal optical phonons have to overcome the hurdles created by the anti-adiabatic nature of the pairing interaction, whereas mechanisms that rely on the soft transverse optical phonons associated with incipient ferroelectricity face challenges related to the nature of the electron–phonon coupling. Proposals in which pairing is mediated by plasmons or promoted locally by defects are also discussed. We finish by surveying the existing evidence for multi-band superconductivity and outlining promising directions that can potentially shed new light on the rich problem of superconductivity in SrTiO3.}

abstract={The occurrence of superconductivity in doped SrTiO3 at low carrier densities points to the presence of an unusually strong pairing interaction that has eluded understanding for several decades. We report experimental results showing the pressure dependence of the superconducting transition temperature, Tc, near to optimal doping that sheds light on the nature of this interaction. We find that Tc increases dramatically when the energy gap of the ferroelectric critical modes is suppressed, i.e., as the ferroelectric quantum critical point is approached in a way reminiscent to behaviour observed in magnetic counterparts. However, in contrast to the latter, the coupling of the carriers to the critical modes in ferroelectrics is predicted to be small. We present a quantitative model involving the dynamical screening of the Coulomb interaction and show that an enhancement of Tc near to a ferroelectric quantum critical point can arise due to the virtual exchange of longitudinal hybrid-polar-modes, even in the absence of a strong coupling to the transverse critical modes.},

	abstract = {Historically, the soft mode theory of ferroelectric phase transitions has been developed for the high-temperature (paraelectric) phase, where the phonon mode softens upon decreasing the temperature. In the low-temperature ferroelectric phase, a similar phonon softening occurs, also leading to a bosonic condensation of the frozen-in mode at the transition, but in this case the phonon softening occurs upon increasing the temperature. Here we present a soft mode theory of ferroelectric and displacive phase transitions by describing what happens in the low-temperature phase in terms of phonon softening and instability. A new derivation of the generalized Lyddane–Sachs–Teller (LST) relation for materials with strong anharmonic phonon damping is also presented which leads to the expression ɛ 0/ɛ ∞ = |ω LO|2/|ω TO|2. The theory provides a microscopic expression for T c as a function of physical parameters, including the mode specific Grüneisen parameter. The theory also shows that , and again specifies the prefactors in terms of Grüneisen parameter and fundamental physical constants. Using the generalized LST relation, the softening of the TO mode leads to the divergence of ϵ 0 and to a polarization catastrophe at T c. A quantitative microscopic form of the Curie–Weiss law is derived with prefactors that depend on microscopic physical parameters.}

abstract={The absence of electrical resistance exhibited by superconducting materials would have enormous potential for applications if it existed at ambient temperature and pressure conditions.

At ambient pressures, cuprates are the material class exhibiting superconductivity to the highest critical superconducting transition temperatures (Tc), up to about 133{\thinspace}K (refs.{\thinspace}3--5). Over the past decade, high-pressure `chemical precompression'6,7 of hydrogen-dominant alloys has led the search for high-temperature superconductivity, with demonstrated Tc approaching the freezing point of water in binary hydrides at megabar pressures8--13. Ternary hydrogen-rich compounds, such as carbonaceous sulfur hydride, offer an even larger chemical space to potentially improve the properties of superconducting hydrides14--21. Here we report evidence of superconductivity on a nitrogen-doped lutetium hydride with a maximum Tc of 294{\thinspace}K at 10{\thinspace}kbar, that is, superconductivity at room temperature and near-ambient pressures. The compound was synthesized under high-pressure high-temperature conditions and then---after full recoverability---its material and superconducting properties were examined along compression pathways. These include temperature-dependent resistance with and without an applied magnetic field, the magnetization (M) versus magnetic field (H) curve, a.c. and d.c. magnetic susceptibility, as well as heat-capacity measurements. X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) and theoretical simulations provide some insight into the stoichiometry of the synthesized material. Nevertheless, further experiments and simulations are needed to determine the exact stoichiometry of hydrogen and nitrogen, and their respective atomistic positions, in a greater effort to further understand the superconducting state of the material.},

Three Raman peaks are observed in the low pressure tetragonal phase. The pressure coefficients and the corresponding mode Grüneisen parameters γ of their frequencies are obtained. The modes are tentatively assigned by comparison to Raman spectra of related TISe-type compounds. The frequency dependence of γ indicates that a hierarchy of bonding forces is present. The appearance and disappearance of a new Raman peak at about 1.75 GPa is probably due to a gradual, pressure induced mutual replacement of In atoms by Tl atoms and does not indicate the occurence of a structural phase transition. Near 7.0 GPa a phase transition occurs, while at even higher pressures indications for a second phase transition are found.},

Phonon dynamics are taken into account, thus giving rise to retardation effects that impact the electrons, in the form of a frequency-dependent electron self-energy. In the superconducting state, this means that the order parameter, generally considered to be a static quantity in the Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer (BCS) theory, also becomes frequency dependent. Here we review the finite temperature formulation of Eliashberg theory, both on the imaginary and real frequency axis, and briefly display some examples of the consequences of a dynamical, as opposed to static, interaction. Along the way we point out where further work is required, concerning the validity of some of the assumptions used."

    abstract = { The measurement of superconductivity at above 200 K in compressed samples of hydrogen sulfide and in lanthanum hydride at 250 K is reinvigorating the search for conventional high temperature superconductors. At the same time, it exposes a fascinating interplay between theory, computation, and experiment. Conventional superconductivity is well understood, and theoretical tools are available for accurate predictions of the superconducting critical temperature. These predictions depend on knowing the microscopic structure of the material under consideration, which can now be provided by computational first-principles structure predictions. The experiments at the megabar pressures required are extremely challenging, but, for some groups at least, permit the experimental exploration of materials space. We discuss the prospects for the search for new superconductors, ideally at lower pressures. }

It was found that the intrinsic width in Q-space of the previously reported huge anomalous phonon softening and broadening is approximately 0.08r.l.u. HWHM. A detailed comparison was also made to inelastic neutron scattering (INS) studies, which indicate a two-peak lineshape (with superimposed broad and narrow peaks) in the vicinity of the anomaly. The high resolution IXS data show that the narrow peak is mostly an artifact of the poor transverse Q-resolution of INS. Otherwise, the agreement between the INS and IXS was excellent.}

abstract={Copper oxide high-TC superconductors possess a number of exotic orders that coexist with or are proximal to superconductivity. Quantum fluctuations associated with these orders may account for the unusual characteristics of the normal state, and possibly affect the superconductivity1--4. Yet, spectroscopic evidence for such quantum fluctuations remains elusive. Here, we use resonant inelastic X-ray scattering to reveal spectroscopic evidence of fluctuations associated with a charge order5--14 in nearly optimally doped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+$\delta$. In the superconducting state, while the quasielastic charge order signal decreases with temperature, the interplay between charge order fluctuations and bond-stretching phonons in the form of a Fano-like interference increases, an observation that is incompatible with expectations for competing orders. Invoking general principles, we argue that this behaviour reflects the properties of a dissipative system near an order--disorder quantum critical point, where the dissipation varies with the opening of the pseudogap and superconducting gap at low temperatures, leading to the proliferation of quantum critical fluctuations, which melt charge order.},

Phonons in a narrow range of momentum space around the CDW ordering vector exhibit extremely large superconductivity-induced line-shape renormalizations. These results imply that the electron--phonon interaction has sufficient strength to generate various anomalies in electronic spectra, but does not contribute significantly to Cooper pairing. In addition, a quasi-elastic `central peak' due to CDW nanodomains is observed in a wide temperature range above and below Tc, suggesting that the gradual onset of a spatially inhomogeneous CDW domain state with decreasing temperature is a generic feature of the underdoped cuprates.},

This chapter focuses on pressure effects in superconductors. The observed effect of pressure on the critical field curve results from a change of superconducting transition temperature, Tc, and a change in the molar electronic specific heat constant γ under pressure, and both these effects can be calculated from the observations. There are also closely connected changes in dimensions, elastic constants, and thermal expansion coefficients. The form that the pressure dependence of Tc takes under very high pressures is also of current interest, and here there is some controversy as to whether superconductivity can be destroyed by pressure alone without the need for a phase change. Pressure-induced phase changes are found to give rise to abrupt changes in Tc, and in a number of cases nonsuperconducting semiconductors are changed to superconducting metals. Quite recently there have been direct measurements of the pressure dependence of the energy gap from tunneling and acoustic attenuation measurements."

Although there is little evidence of any anharmonicity, the phonon shows some softening in the optic modes at the zone boundary. Furthermore, an extra mode forms at high temperatures, which is incompatible with a structure composed of a monoclinic Bravais lattice with a two-atom basis. We investigate the effect that the f electron–phonon interaction has on the phonon spectrum and its role on the possible formation of a breathing mode."

Starting from the strong-coupling formula for the critical temperature, and assuming that the strain sensitivity stems mostly from the electron–phonon α2F function, we link the strain dependence of the critical properties to a widening of α2F. This widening is attributed to the nonlinear generation of phonons, which takes place in the anharmonic deformation potential induced by the strain. Based on the theory of sum- and difference-frequency wave generation in nonlinear media, we obtain an explicit connection between the widening of α2F and the anharmonic energy. The resulting model is fit to experimental datasets for Nb3Sn, and the anharmonic energy extracted from the fits is compared with first-principles calculations.}

	abstract = {Transport in the so-called {\textquotedblleft}bad metallic{\textquotedblright} regime of strongly correlated electron systems with no well-defined electronic quasiparticles has been a long-standing challenge in theoretical physics. This challenge has motivated collection of an ample amount of data on bad metals. However, so far, emphasis has been given to the charge sector, with the host crystal lattice treated as a well-defined phonon background. In this paper, we show that, for cuprates in the bad metallic regime where resistivity exceeds the {\textquotedblleft}Mott{\textendash}Ioffe{\textendash}Regel{\textquotedblright} limit, phonon excitations are also not well-defined. The data lead to a thermal transport scenario where entropy is carried by an overdamped diffusive fluid of electrons and phonons characterized by a unique velocity and a quantum-limited relaxation time ℏ/kBT.The thermal diffusivity in the ab plane of underdoped YBCO crystals is measured by means of a local optical technique in the temperature range of 25{\textendash}300 K. The phase delay between a point heat source and a set of detection points around it allows for high-resolution measurement of the thermal diffusivity and its in-plane anisotropy. Although the magnitude of the diffusivity may suggest that it originates from phonons, its anisotropy is comparable with reported values of the electrical resistivity anisotropy. Furthermore, the anisotropy drops sharply below the charge order transition, again similar to the electrical resistivity anisotropy. Both of these observations suggest that the thermal diffusivity has pronounced electronic as well as phononic character. At the same time, the small electrical and thermal conductivities at high temperatures imply that neither well-defined electron nor phonon quasiparticles are present in this material. We interpret our results through a strongly interacting incoherent electron{\textendash}phonon {\textquotedblleft}soup{\textquotedblright} picture characterized by a diffusion constant D\~{}vB2τ, where vB is the soup velocity, and scattering of both electrons and phonons saturates a quantum thermal relaxation time τ\~{}ℏ/kBT.},

abstract={We use first-principles methods to study doped strong ferroelectrics (taking BaTiO3 as a prototype). Here, we find a strong coupling between itinerant electrons and soft polar phonons in doped BaTiO3, contrary to Anderson/Blount's weakly coupled electron mechanism for "ferroelectric-like metals''. As a consequence, across a polar-to-centrosymmetric phase transition in doped BaTiO3, the total electron-phonon coupling is increased to about 0.6 around the critical concentration, which is sufficient to induce phonon-mediated superconductivity of about 2 K. Lowering the crystal symmetry of doped BaTiO3 by imposing epitaxial strain can further increase the superconducting temperature via a sizable coupling between itinerant electrons and acoustic phonons. Our work demonstrates a viable approach to modulating electron-phonon coupling and inducing phonon-mediated superconductivity in doped strong ferroelectrics and potentially in polar metals. Our results also show that the weakly coupled electron mechanism for "ferroelectric-like metals'' is not necessarily present in doped strong ferroelectrics.},

We uncover a spectacular, extreme softening and reconstruction of an entire manifold of low-energy acoustic and optic branches across a structural transition, reflecting strong directionality in bonding strength and anharmonicity. Further, our results solve a prior controversy by revealing the soft-mode mechanism of the phase transition that impacts thermal transport and thermoelectric efficiency. Our simulations of anharmonic phonon renormalization go beyond low-order perturbation theory and capture these striking effects, showing that the large phonon shifts directly affect the thermal conductivity by altering both the phonon scattering phase space and the group velocities. These results provide a detailed microscopic understanding of phase stability and thermal transport in technologically important materials, providing further insights on ways to control phonon propagation in thermoelectrics, photovoltaics, and other materials requiring thermal management.},

abstract={Understanding elementary excitations and their couplings in condensed matter systems is critical for developing better energy-conversion devices. In thermoelectric materials, the heat-to-electricity conversion efficiency is directly improved by suppressing the propagation of phonon quasiparticles responsible for macroscopic thermal transport. The current record material for thermoelectric conversion efficiency, SnSe, has an ultralow thermal conductivity, but the mechanism behind the strong phonon scattering remains largely unknown. From inelastic neutron scattering measurements and first-principles simulations, we mapped the four-dimensional phonon dispersion surfaces of SnSe, and found the origin of the ionic-potential anharmonicity responsible for the unique properties of SnSe. We show that the giant phonon scattering arises from an unstable electronic structure, with orbital interactions leading to a ferroelectric-like lattice instability. The present results provide a microscopic picture connecting electronic structure and phonon anharmonicity in SnSe, and offers new insights on how electron--phonon and phonon--phonon interactions may lead to the realization of ultralow thermal conductivity.},

abstract = {The study of anharmonic effects in crystals has received considerable attention in the last few years. As a result of this it has been shown that many properties can be understood by expanding the interatomic potential and keeping only the lowest-order terms in the anharmonicity. The theory of thermal expansion, elastic and dielectric properties, Raman and neutron scattering, and specific heat at low temperatures are all discussed from this point of view. The main lack in our understanding of these properties is uncertainty in the interatomic potentials, and some of the approximations used in calculations are discussed.

The theory of the thermodynamic behaviour, including thermal conductivity and second sound, is developed from the phonon Boltzmann equation. The theory of these properties is considerably more complicated, particularly from a microscopic point of view, than that of those properties described above, and few detailed calculations have been made. There are some examples of where the anharmonic effects are large and low-order perturbation theory is inadequate. One of these is close to displacive phase transitions, another is in solid helium and a third occurs in all solids close to their melting point. The theoretical work which has been done on these systems is described, although there remains a great deal to be done before our understanding of these is in any sense complete.}

    abstract = { The measurement of superconductivity at above 200 K in compressed samples of hydrogen sulfide and in lanthanum hydride at 250 K is reinvigorating the search for conventional high temperature superconductors. At the same time, it exposes a fascinating interplay between theory, computation, and experiment. Conventional superconductivity is well understood, and theoretical tools are available for accurate predictions of the superconducting critical temperature. These predictions depend on knowing the microscopic structure of the material under consideration, which can now be provided by computational first principles structure predictions. The experiments at the megabar pressures required are extremely challenging, but, for some groups at least, permit the experimental exploration of materials space. We discuss the prospects for the search for new superconductors, ideally at lower pressures. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Condensed Matter Physics, Volume 11 is March 10, 2020. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates. }

abstract = "A B.C.S. type of theory (see Bardeen, Cooper and Schreiffer, Phys. Rev.108, 1175 (1957)) is sketched for very dirty superconductors, where elastic scattering from physical and chemical impurities is large compared with the energy gap. This theory is based on pairing each one-electron state with its exact time reverse, a generalization of the k up, âk down pairing of the B.C.S. theory which is independent of such scattering. Such a theory has many qualitative and a few quantitative points of agreement with experiment, in particular with specific-heat data, energy-gap measurements, and transition-temperature versus impurity curves. Other types of pairing which have been suggested are not compatible with the existence of dirty superconductors."

abstract={The transition temperature of a superconductor depends on a2F(o), the spectral function of the effective interaction due to phonon exchange. We discuss how strongly the transition temperature is influenced by different frequency parts of a2F(o). For this purpose the functional derivative dTc/da2F(o) is calculated. It is shown that all frequency regions of a2F(o) yield a positive contribution toTcand that the most effective range covers frequencies, slightly above 2pTc. The functional derivative is calculated numerically for several superconductors from their measured a2F(o)-spectra. Finally, we discuss the change in transition temperature due to the softening of a2F(o) which has been observed in amorphous superconductors.},

journal={Nature Materials},
year={2008},
volume={7},
number={11},
pages={870-877},
abstract={The physical properties of a topologically disordered amorphous material (glass), such as heat capacity and thermal conductivity, are markedly different from those of its ordered crystalline counterpart. The understanding of these phenomena is a notoriously complex problem. One of the universal features of disordered glasses is the 'boson peak', which is observed in neutron and Raman scattering experiments. The boson peak is typically ascribed to an excess density of vibrational states. Here, we study the nature of the boson peak, using numerical simulations of several glass-forming systems. We discovered evidence suggestive of the equality of the boson peak frequency to the Ioffe-Regel limit for 'transverse' phonons, above which transverse phonons no longer propagate. Our results indicate a possibility that the origin of the boson peak is transverse vibrational modes associated with defective soft structures in the disordered state. Furthermore, we suggest a possible link between slow structural relaxation and fast boson peak dynamics in glass-forming systems.},

%In general circumstances, the simplification of setting ($\omega_n=0$) without accounting for the additional ``1/2" would yield incorrect results and qualitatively different predictions. However, we have checked that this is not the case here. %, as the simplification gained by the analytical tractability outweighs the cost of quantitative discrepancies in the behavior of $T_c$
 %The peak $T_c$ enhancement is overestimated in the simplified solution but the qualitative behavior of the non-monotonicity is unaffected. The cost of this simplification is minimal but yields a more tractable formula (there would be two unsymmetrized terms without the simplification, making the final formula a bit clumsy) that can be fitted to experiments more readily.  %That the results don't change qualitatively is because the stokes and anti-stokes interference mechanism continues to hold even while setting $\omega_n=0$.

title = {Possible enhancement of the superconducting  due to sharp Kohn-like soft phonon anomalies},
journal = {Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter},
abstract = {Phonon softening is a ubiquitous phenomenon in condensed matter systems which is often associated with charge density wave (CDW) instabilities and anharmonicity. The interplay between phonon softening, CDW and superconductivity is a topic of intense debate. In this work, the effects of anomalous soft phonon instabilities on superconductivity are studied based on a recently developed theoretical framework that accounts for phonon damping and softening within the Migdal–Eliashberg theory. Model calculations show that the phonon softening in the form of a sharp dip in the phonon dispersion relation, either acoustic or optical (including the case of Kohn-type anomalies typically associated with CDW), can cause a manifold increase of the electron–phonon coupling constant λ. This, under certain conditions, which are consistent with the concept of optimal frequency introduced by Bergmann and Rainer, can produce a large increase of the superconducting transition temperature . In summary, our results suggest the possibility of reaching high-temperature superconductivity by exploiting soft phonon anomalies restricted in momentum space.}

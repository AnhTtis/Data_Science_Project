    "abstract": "Kerr-cat qubits are a promising candidate for fault-tolerant quantum computers owing to the biased nature of their errors. The $ZZ$ coupling between the qubits can be utilized for a two-qubit entangling gate, but the residual coupling called $ZZ$ crosstalk is detrimental to precise computing. In order to resolve this problem, we propose a tunable $ZZ$-coupling scheme using two transmon couplers. By setting the detunings of the two couplers at opposite values, the residual $ZZ$ couplings via the two couplers cancel each other out. We also apply our scheme to the $R_{zz}(Θ)$ gate ($ZZ$ rotation with angle $Θ$), one of the two-qubit entangling gates. We numerically show that the fidelity of the $R_{zz}(-π/2)$ gate is higher than 99.9% in a case of $16$-ns gate time and without decoherence.",

    "abstract": "Thermal shock resistance is one of the performance-defining properties for applications where extreme temperature gradients are required. The thermal shock resistance of a material can be described by means of the thermal shock parameter RT. Here, the thermo-mechanical properties required for RT calculation are quantum-mechanically predicted and experimentally determined and compared for Ti3AlC2 and Cr2AlC MAX phases. The coatings are synthesized utilizing direct-current magnetron sputtering without additional heating, followed by vacuum annealing. It is shown that the RT of Ti3AlC2 obtained via simulations is in good agreement with the experimentally obtained one. However, for Cr2AlC, the theoretical predictions result in an almost three times larger RT vs. the experimentally deduced value, primarily caused by neglecting spin-polarization in the calculation of the electron-phonon scattering time as a component of the thermal conductivity. Comparing the MAX phase coatings, both experiments and simulations indicate superior thermal shock behavior of Ti3AlC2 compared to Cr2AlC.",

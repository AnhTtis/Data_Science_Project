    "abstract": "The Unruh effect states that a uniformly linearly accelerated observer with proper acceleration $a$ experiences the Minkowski vacuum as a thermal state at temperature $T_U=a/(2π)$. An observer in uniform circular motion is known to experience a similar effective temperature, which however depends also on the orbital speed and the excitation energy. This paper addresses an observer in uniform circular motion in an ambient thermal bath. We model the observer as an Unruh-DeWitt detector, coupled to a massless scalar field in $2 + 1$ spacetime dimensions, adopting an analogue spacetime formulation that may become experimentally testable in laboratory systems. We establish analytic results for the observer's effective temperature in several asymptotic regions of the parameter space and provide numerical results in the interpolating regions. There exist parameter regimes where the observer sees a temperature lower than the ambient temperature, experiencing a cooling Unruh effect.",

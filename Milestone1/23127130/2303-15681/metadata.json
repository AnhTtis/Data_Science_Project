    "abstract": "Physics-based deep learning frameworks have shown to be effective in accurately modeling the dynamics of complex physical systems with generalization capability across problem inputs. However, time-independent problems pose the challenge of requiring long-range exchange of information across the computational domain for obtaining accurate predictions. In the context of graph neural networks (GNNs), this calls for deeper networks, which, in turn, may compromise or slow down the training process. In this work, we present two GNN architectures to overcome this challenge - the Edge Augmented GNN and the Multi-GNN. We show that both these networks perform significantly better (by a factor of 1.5 to 2) than baseline methods when applied to time-independent solid mechanics problems. Furthermore, the proposed architectures generalize well to unseen domains, boundary conditions, and materials. Here, the treatment of variable domains is facilitated by a novel coordinate transformation that enables rotation and translation invariance. By broadening the range of problems that neural operators based on graph neural networks can tackle, this paper provides the groundwork for their application to complex scientific and industrial settings.",

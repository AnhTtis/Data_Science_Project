    "abstract": "In this work we study the acyclic orientations of complete multipartite graphs. We obtain an encoding of the acyclic orientations of the complete $p$-partite graph with size of its parts $n:=n_1,n_2,\\ldots,n_p$ via a vector with $p$ symbols and length $n_1+n_2+\\ldots+n_p$ when the parts are fixed but not the vertices in each part. We also give a recursive way to construct all acyclic orientations of a complete multipartite graph, this construction can be done by computer easily in order $\\mathcal{O}(n)$. Besides, obtained codification of the acyclic orientations allows us to count the number of non-isomorphic acyclic orientations of the complete multipartite graphs. Furthermore, we obtain a closed formula for non-isomorphic acyclic orientations of the complete multipartite graphs with a directed spanning tree. In addition, we obtain a closed formula for the ordinary generating functions for the number of strings in the alphabet $\\{s_1,s_2,\\ldots,s_p\\}$ with $k_1$ characters $s_1$, $k_2$ characters $s_2$, and so on with $k_p$ characters $s_p$ such that no two consecutive characters are the same. Finally, we obtain a closed formula for the number of acyclic orientation of a complete multipartite graph $K_{n_1,\\ldots,n_p}$ with labelled vertices.",

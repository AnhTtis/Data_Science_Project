    Fig. \ref{fig:4}-a shows the impact of various compression ratios on VAE output images. At lower compression ratios, reconstructed images more closely resemble original input images. Importantly, we see a marked improvement in histologic features that are critical for interpretability such as refined cell-to-cell borders and sharper demarcation of cytoplasmic vs. nuclei compartments.
    
  

    Moreover, in Fig. \ref{fig:4}-b, we use UMAP to visualize the latent space vectors learned by our pipeline. The UMAP captures intra-tumor and across-tumor relationships, separating all four tissue types into distinct clusters. Interestingly, clusters of brain and colon cancers share overlapping boundaries whereas the breast cancer cluster is uniquely separated from the brain cancer cluster. Additionally, the UMAP identifies a distinct sub-cluster of brain tumor samples that does not overlap with any other cancer types.

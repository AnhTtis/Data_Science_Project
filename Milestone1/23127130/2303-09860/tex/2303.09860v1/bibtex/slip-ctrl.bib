	abstract = "Several models exist to simulate traction performance of a tractor, however, for most of them a proper experimental validation is missing. Moreover, their possible application for a practical use in a wide range of vehicles, equipment and soil configurations has never been further developed. This study examines a semi-empirical model of soil-tyre interaction, adapted to simulate the traction performance of mechanical front wheel drive tractors, taking into account not only mechanical soil and tyre parameters and static vehicle load but also the multi-pass effect, the load transfer effect, and the theoretical speed ratio between front and rear axles. This model simulates drawbar pull, traction coefficient, traction efficiency, and motion resistance as a function of slip, wheel load, tyre size and pressure. Several traction tests were performed on four Swiss agricultural soils of different type (clay, clay loam, silty loam, and loamy sand) in order to validate the model experimentally. Three tractors of widely ranging power (from 40 to 132kW) and weight (from 24 to 68kN) were used. Tractor configurations were varied by changing tyre pressure and tractor weight. Slip normally ranged between 5 and 30%. In most of the cases the model simulated drawbar pull as well as its variations due to changes in tyre pressure, wheel load, and soil strength reliably for practical purposes. Only when high wheel load was combined with low inflation pressure the model did not give suitable results due to an overestimation of the rolling radius. Based on the presented model, a convenient Excel-application called TASCV3.0 was developed for the practice. Such a practical computer-tool supports farmers in decision making concerning the tractor configuration, oriented to save fuel during agricultural operations."

	abstract = "On rough terrain, excessive wheel slippage is easily generated by changes of surface conditions such as soil types and geometries. It induces considerable loss of wheel traction and battery energy. To prevent this, wheeled robots should consistently recognize the current situation generated between wheel and surface. And also wheeled robots are required to optimally control wheel motion in limited wheel traction and battery capacity. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel wheel control algorithm based on slip optimization of traction and energy, which is adaptive to change of surface condition. Proposed wheel control algorithm is called Traction-Energy Balancing Adaptive Control (TEB) in this paper and TEB assigns optimized rotation speed to each wheel by observing wheel slip ratio which is a key parameter of TEB. As functions of TEB, TEB is largely divided into three main parts; (1) slip optimizer (2) slip controller (3) SC-compensator. In the slip optimizer, two optimal slip models were derived as a function of slip ratios regarding maximum traction and tractive efficiency using experimental data about wheel-terrain interaction in three types of soil (grass, gravel and sand). And the optimal slip models were employed in order to determine a desired slip value of wheel with observation of a change in actual robot velocity as control input in the slip controller. For optimal slip control, the proposed slip controller is based on conventional PID controller with compensating disturbance in the controller (SC-compensator) which occurs by change of surface shapes. In the SC-compensator, radial function networks (RBFN) was applied in the slip controller and RBFN was of help to readjust previously set PID gains depending on occurred slip error. Finally, TEB was experimentally verified by controlling a real robot having four wheels on various terrain types."

	abstract = "Traction efficiency of farm tractors barely reaches 50% in field operations (Renius et al., 1985). On the other hand, modern trends in agriculture show growth of the global tractor markets and at the same time increased demands for greenhouse gas emission reduction as well as energy efficiency due to increasing fuel costs. Engine power of farm tractors is growing at 1.8 kW per year reaching today about 500 kW for the highest traction class machines. The problem of effective use of energy has become crucial. Existing slip control approaches for farm tractors do not fulfil this requirement due to fixed reference set-point. This paper suggests an optimal control scheme which extends a conventional slip controller with set-point optimisation based on assessment of soil conditions, namely, wheel-ground parameter estimation. The optimisation considers the traction efficiency and net traction ratio and adaptively adjusts the set-point under changing soil conditions. The proposed methodology can be mainly implemented in farm tractors equipped with hydraulic or electrical infinitely variable transmissions (IVT) with use of the drive torque feedback."

The purpose of this study was to analyse the effects of soil texture, soil moisture and compaction as well as horizontal deformation and vertical load on traction force and traction efficiency. Analysis and mathematical modelling were performed with the use of artificial neural networks (ANN). Accurate mathematical models were obtained with high values of coefficient of determination R2 for the validation data set (R2=0.945 for traction force and R2=0.963 for traction efficiency). Based on neural models, analysis of the contribution of independent input variables was performed. Soil texture and soil moisture had the highest influence on traction force and traction efficiency; vertical load significantly affected traction force. Horizontal deformation and soil compaction had minor influences on both dependent variables. Evolutionary algorithm was used for the determination of soil conditions and vertical load which produce high traction force and traction efficiency. The vertical load is considered as an easily managed parameter during agricultural operations. Since the increase in vertical load results in increasing traction force and, at the same time, in decreasing traction efficiency, the appropriate vertical load value was calculated for optimization of traction force and traction efficiency in changing soil conditions, which is crucial for tillage management."

	abstract = "Intelligent machines were developed in various sectors including agriculture to ameliorate the problem of labor shortage especially the skilled ones. Due to concern about the environment and the rising cost of fuel, the performance of such machines needs to be optimized to save energy and protect the environment. Online traction control is a viable option in achieving the objectives of saving energy, and environmental protection in vehicles. Thus, the primary aim of the paper is to review the entire traction control process in intelligent tractors; this is to identify the current trend and future directions of the researches. The paper includes; review of soil wheel interaction models used in online traction control, model parameters estimation for online traction control, wheel slip estimation, and finally traction control and implementation."

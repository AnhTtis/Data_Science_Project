    "abstract": "The demands of proliferating big data and massive deep learning models, against a backdrop of a mounting climate emergency and the abating of Moore's law, push technologists to develop high-speed, high-throughput, low energy and miniaturisable computer hardware. Using light as a fundamental resource, free-space optical computing and on-chip photonic computing devices provide, respectively, powers of natural parallelism and miniaturisability. Recent work harnessing diffractive effects inside planar (or slab) waveguides has seemingly combined the best elements of each competing technology. Yet, as this paper argues, certain challenges will emerge as the clock-speeds of on-chip diffractive systems are pushed to compete with legacy technologies. Using a \"time-aware\" analytical approach to wave propagation, a prediction is made of the presence of a time-based error term that has not yet been accounted for in on-chip diffractive architectures. System operating frequency bounds in the gigahertz range are quantified, above which time-based errors discernibly affect the accuracy of system performance, and below which the errors can safely be ignored, using design parameters from previously published work. The analysis and related bounds presented hold value in any context where high throughput on-chip diffractive operations may be exploited, including beam-shaping, spectroscopy, sensing and communications.",

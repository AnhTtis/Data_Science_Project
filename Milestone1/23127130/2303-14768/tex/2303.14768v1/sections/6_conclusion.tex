\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

%This paper proposes Collaborative noisy Label Cleaner (CLC) framework, a new method to handle noisy labels in video highlight detection.
%We make use of the augmented cross-propagation module to better enhance network robustness and achieve cleaner highlight labels by observing the loss changes of different modalities.
%We demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method with extensive experiments on MovieLights and YouTube highlight datasets.
%For future work, we are interested in extending our method to other video-understanding tasks such as scene segmentation and action recognition.

In this study, we present Collaborative noisy Label Cleaner (CLC), a novel framework to handle noisy labels in video highlight detection.
We make use of the augmented cross-propagation module to better enhance network robustness and multi-modality cleaning to achieve cleaner highlight labels by observing the loss changes of different modalities.
We demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method with extensive experiments on MovieLights and YouTube Highlights datasets.
In future work, we are interested in extending the proposed mechanisms to other video-understanding tasks such as scene segmentation and video temporal grounding.

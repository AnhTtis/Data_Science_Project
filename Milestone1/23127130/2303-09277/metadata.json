    "abstract": "The gravitational field with spin-2 is introduced naturally by the requirement that the Lagrangian is locally translation invariant in Minkowski spacetime. The interactions between avitational field and spin-1/2, 0, 1 matter fields are obtained as well as the Lagrangian for the gravitational field including self-interactions. The deflection angle of light when it passes through the sun is calculated with different gauge conditions as an example. Our leading-order result is the same as that from general relativity though the basic ideas are quite different. It is interesting that gravity could be described in the similar way as the other fundamental interactions in Minkowski spacetime and it may provide new scenario of the Universe.",

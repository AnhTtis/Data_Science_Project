    "abstract": "Context: The Internet of Things (IoT) has brought expectations for software\ninclusion in everyday objects. However, it has challenges and requires\nmultidisciplinary technical knowledge involving different areas that should be\ncombined to enable IoT software systems engineering. Goal: To present an\nevidence-based roadmap for IoT development to support developers in specifying,\ndesigning, and implementing IoT systems. Method: An iterative approach based on\nexperimental studies to acquire evidence to define the IoT Roadmap. Next, the\nSystems Engineering Body of Knowledge life cycle was used to organize the\nroadmap and set temporal dimensions for IoT software systems engineering.\nResults: The studies revealed seven IoT Facets influencing IoT development. The\nIoT Roadmap comprises 117 items organized into 29 categories representing\ndifferent concerns for each Facet. In addition, an experimental study was\nconducted observing a real case of a healthcare IoT project, indicating the\nroadmap applicability. Conclusions: The IoT Roadmap can be a feasible\ninstrument to assist IoT software systems engineering because it can (a)\nsupport researchers and practitioners in understanding and characterizing the\nIoT and (b) provide a checklist to identify the applicable recommendations for\nengineering IoT software systems.",

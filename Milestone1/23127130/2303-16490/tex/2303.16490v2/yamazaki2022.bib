 abstract = {Since it was first published in 1987, Galactic Dynamics has become the most widely used advanced textbook on the structure and dynamics of galaxies and one of the most cited references in astrophysics. Now, in this extensively revised and updated edition, James Binney and Scott Tremaine describe the dramatic recent advances in this subject, makingGalactic Dynamics the most authoritative introduction to galactic astrophysics available to advanced undergraduate students, graduate students, and researchers.Every part of the book has been thoroughly overhauled, and many sections have been completely rewritten. Many new topics are covered, including N-body simulation methods, black holes in stellar systems, linear stability and response theory, and galaxy formation in the cosmological context. Binney and Tremaine, two of the world's leading astrophysicists, use the tools of theoretical physics to describe how galaxies and other stellar systems work, succinctly and lucidly explaining theoretical principles and their applications to observational phenomena. They provide readers with an understanding of stellar dynamics at the level needed to reach the frontiers of the subject.This new edition of the classic text is the definitive introduction to the field.?    A complete revision and update of one of the most cited references in astrophysics    Provides a comprehensive description of the dynamical structure and evolution of galaxies and other stellar systems    Serves as both a graduate textbook and a resource for researchers    Includes 20 color illustrations, 205 figures, and more than 200 problems    Covers the gravitational N-body problem, hierarchical galaxy formation, galaxy mergers, dark matter, spiral structure, numerical simulations, orbits and chaos, equilibrium and stability of stellar systems, evolution of binary stars and star clusters, and much more    Companion volume to Galactic Astronomy, the definitive book on the phenomenology of galaxies and star clusters    },

title={Quantum Algorithms for Linear Algebra and Machine Learning},
pages={89},
abstract={Most quantum algorithms offering speedups over classical algorithms are based on the three techniques of phase estimation, amplitude estimation and Hamiltonian simulation. In spite of the linear algebraic nature of the postulates of quantum mechanics, until recent work by Lloyd and coauthors no quantum algorithms achieving speedups for linear algebra or machine learning had been proposed. A quantum machine learning algorithm must address three issues: encoding of classical data into a succinct quantum representation, processing the quantum representation and extraction of classically useful information from the processed quantum state. In this dissertation, we make progress on all three aspects of the quantum machine learning problem and obtain quantum algorithms for low rank approximation and regularized least squares. The oracle QRAM, the standard model studied in quantum query complexity, requires time O(sqrt n) to encode vectors v in Rn into quantum states. We propose simple hardware augmentations to the oracle QRAM, , that enable vectors $v in Rn to be encoded in time O(log n), with pre-processing. The augmented QRAM, incurs minimal hardware overheads, the pre-processing can be parallelized and is a flexible model that allows storage of multiple vectors and matrices. It provides a framework for designing quantum algorithms for linear algebra and machine learning. Using the augmented QRAM, for vector state preparation, we present two different algorithms for singular value estimation where given singular vector $ket{v}$ for $A in R{mtimes n}$, the singular value $sigma_{i}$is estimated within additive error $epsilon norm{A}_{F}$. The first algorithm requires time $wt{1/epsilon{3}}$ and uses the approach for simulating $e{-irho}$ in cite{LMR13}. However, the analysis cite{LMR13} does not establish the coherence of outputs, we provide a qualitatively different analysis that uses the quantum Zeno effect to establish coherence and reveals the probabilistic nature of the simulation technique. The second algorithm has a running time $wt{1/epsilon}$ and uses Jordan's lemma from linear algebra and the augmented QRAM, to implement reflections. We use quantum singular value estimation to obtain algorithms for low rank approximation by column selection, the algorithms are based on importance sampling from the leverage score distribution. We obtain quadratic speedups for a large class of linear algebra algorithms that rely on importance sampling from the leverage score distribution including approximate least squares and CX and CUR decompositions. Classical algorithms for these problems require time O(mn log n + poly(1/ε)), the quantum algorithms have running time O(sqrt mpoly(1/ε, k, Δ)) where k, Δ are the rank and spectral gap. The running time of the quantum CX decomposition algorithm does not depend on m, it is polynomial in problem parameters. We also provide quantum algorithms for ℓ2 regularized regression problems, the quantum ridge regression algorithm requires time Õ (1/μ2 δ) to output a quantum state that is δ close to the solution, where μ is the regularization parameter.},

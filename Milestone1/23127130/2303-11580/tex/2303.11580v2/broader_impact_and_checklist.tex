\section{Broader Impact Statement}
\label{sec:broader-impact}
It is difficult to ascribe ethical impact to individual papers that focus more on general-purpose algorithms or approaches meant to optimize performance by reducing resource usage such as this paper. Since this paper focuses on an end goal of maintaining machine learning performance, while reducing the resources used to achieve this goal, we can confidently say that there are no foreseeable potential negative societal impacts that would be brought about by the publication of this paper.

While this paper uses human-derived data for testing and verification purposes, the datasets used do not contain any personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive personally identifiable information (SPII). We use popular public datasets in order to show performance to familiar data and a few datasets internal to our company representing a company-internal service, optimize client-server data transfers within a large social network, support user authentication, and access to online resources. These datasets also conform to rules and regulations internal to our company.

We have additionally tried to make this paper as accessible as possible to all reviewers and potential audience.

% The 9 pages allocated for the main paper must include a broader impact
% statement regarding the approach, datasets and applications proposed/used in
% your paper. It should reflect on the environmental, ethical and societal
% implications of your work. The statement should require at most one page and
% must be included both at submission and camera-ready time.

\section{Submission Checklist}

% The submission checklist is a combination of the NeurIPS '21 checklist:
%
%   https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2021/PaperInformation/PaperChecklist
%
% and the NAS checklist:
%
%   https://www.automl.org/wp-content/uploads/NAS/NAS_checklist.pdf
%
% For each question, change the default \answerTODO{} to either:
%
%     \answerYes{[justification]},
%     \answerNo{[justification]}, or
%     \answerNA{[justification]}.
%
% *You must include a brief justification to your answer,* either by
% referencing the appropriate section of your paper or providing a brief inline
% description.  For example:
%
% - Did you include the license of the code and datasets?
%   \answerYes{See Section~\ref{sec:code}.}
%
% - Did you include all the code for running experiments?
%   \answerNo{We include the code we wrote, but it depends on proprietary
%   libraries for executing on a compute cluster and as such will not be
%   runnable without modifications. We also include a runnable sequential
%   version of the code that we also report experiments in the paper with.}
%
% - Did you include the license of the datasets?
%   \answerNA{Our experiments were conducted on publicly available datasets and
%   we did not introduce new datasets.}
%
% Please note that if you answer a question with \answerNo{}, we expect that you
% compensate for it (e.g., if you cannot provide the full evaluation code, you
% should at least provide code for a minimal reproduction of the main insights
% of your paper).
%
% Please do not modify the questions and only use the provided macros for your
% answers. Note that this section does not count towards the page limit.

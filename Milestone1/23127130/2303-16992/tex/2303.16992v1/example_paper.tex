\begin{abstract}
Recent work has compared neural network representations via 
  similarity-based analyses, shedding light on how different aspects (architecture, training data, etc.) affect models' internal representations.
  The quality of a similarity measure is typically evaluated by its success in assigning a high score to representations that are expected to be matched. 
  However, existing similarity measures  perform mediocrely on standard benchmarks. 
  In this work, we develop a new similarity measure, dubbed \method{}, based on contrastive learning. In contrast to common closed-form similarity measures, \method{} learns a parameterized measure by using both similar and dissimilar examples. 
 We perform an extensive experimental evaluation of our method, with both language and vision models, on the standard layer prediction benchmark and two new benchmarks that we introduce: the multilingual benchmark and the image--caption benchmark. In all cases, \method{} achieves much higher accuracy than previous similarity measures, even when presented with challenging examples, and reveals new insights not captured by previous measures.

% This document was modified from the file originally made available by
% Pat Langley and Andrea Danyluk for ICML-2K. This version was created
% by Iain Murray in 2018, and modified by Alexandre Bouchard in
% 2019 and 2021 and by Csaba Szepesvari, Gang Niu and Sivan Sabato in 2022.
% Modified again in 2023 by Sivan Sabato and Jonathan Scarlett.
% Previous contributors include Dan Roy, Lise Getoor and Tobias
% Scheffer, which was slightly modified from the 2010 version by
% Thorsten Joachims & Johannes Fuernkranz, slightly modified from the
% 2009 version by Kiri Wagstaff and Sam Roweis's 2008 version, which is
% slightly modified from Prasad Tadepalli's 2007 version which is a
% lightly changed version of the previous year's version by Andrew
% Moore, which was in turn edited from those of Kristian Kersting and
% Codrina Lauth. Alex Smola contributed to the algorithmic style files.

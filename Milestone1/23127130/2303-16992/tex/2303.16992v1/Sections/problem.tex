\section{Problem Setup}
Let $\mathbb{X}=\{(x_1^{(i)}, x_2^{(i)}) \}_{i=1}^N$ denote a set of $N$ examples, and  $\mathbb{A}=\{(\bm{a}_1^{(i)}, \bm{a}_2^{(i)}) \}_{i=1}^N$ the set of representations generated for the examples in $\mathbb{X}$. 
A representation is a high-dimensional vector of neuron activations. Representations may be created by different models, different layers of the same model, etc.
For instance,  $x_1^{(i)}$ and  $x_2^{(i)}$ may be the same input, with $\bm{a}_1^{(i)}$ and $\bm{a}_2^{(i)}$ representations of that input in different layers. Alternatively, $x_1^{(i)}$ can be an image and $x_2^{(i)}$  its caption, with  $\bm{a}_1^{(i)}$ and $\bm{a}_2^{(i)}$ their representations from a vision model and a language model, respectively. 

Our goal is to obtain a scalar similarity score, which represents the similarity between the two sets of representations, $\bm{a}_1^{(i)}$ and $\bm{a}_2^{(i)}$, and ranges from $0$ (no similarity) to $1$ (identical representations). 
That is, we define $\bm{X}_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times p_1}$ as a matrix of $p_1$-dim activations of $N$ data points, and $\bm{X}_2 \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times p_2}$ as another matrix of $p_2$-dim activations of $N$ data points. We seek a similarity measure, $s(\bm{X}_1, \bm{X}_2)$.

    "abstract": "We prove that sofic mean dimension of any amenable group action does not depend on the choice of sofic approximation sequences. Previously, this result was known only if the acting group is an infinite amenable group; however, in the case of a finite group action, this knowledge was restricted to finite-dimensional compact metrizable spaces only. We also prove that sofic mean dimension of any full shift depends purely on its alphabet. Previously, this was shown only when the alphabet is a finite-dimensional compact metrizable space.\n  Our method is a refinement of the classical technique in relation to the estimates for mean dimension from above and below, respectively. The key point of our results is that both of them apply to all compact metrizable spaces without any restriction (in particular, any of the alphabets and spaces concerned in our results is not required to be finite-dimensional).",

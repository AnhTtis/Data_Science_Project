\section{Conclusion}

% This method is based on the proper combination of the Extended Kalman filter and particle filter.
% It successfully addresses the problem of uncertainty in the initial state of the object and outperforms the particle filter in both symmetric and non-symmetric environments.
% Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed filtering method requires fewer particles for convergence in terms of both MSE and FSE quality criteria. Although every iteration of the proposed method is more costly compared with the particle filter, the runtime of the proposed method is significantly smaller due to the smaller number of particles necessary for convergence to the same error rates. Also, we illustrate that the proposed approach is more robust to the level of measurement noise than the classical particle filter

% Also, we illustrate that the proposed approach is more robust to the level of measurement noise than the classical particle filter.

In the presented study, we consider the object localization problem with an unknown initial state in both symmetric and non-symmetric environments. 
We demonstrate that the standard particle filter algorithm performs poorly in highly symmetrical environments. 
We propose a novel multiparticle Kalman filter (MKF) based on the combination of the extended Kalman filter and particle filter. 
The MKF successfully addresses the problem of uncertainty in the object's initial state and outperforms the particle filter in all considered environments.
Our numerical experiments demonstrate that MKF requires fewer particles to achieve convergence in terms of both MSE and FSE quality criteria. 
Although every iteration of the proposed method is more costly compared to the particle filter, MKF converges faster since fewer particles are required to achieve the same error rates.
Also, we show that MKF is more robust to the level of measurement noise than the classical particle filter.

    "abstract": "This study considers the object localization problem and proposes a novel\nmultiparticle Kalman filter to solve it in complex and symmetric environments.\nTwo well-known classes of filtering algorithms to solve the localization\nproblem are Kalman filter-based methods and particle filter-based methods. We\nconsider these classes, demonstrate their complementary properties, and propose\na novel filtering algorithm that takes the best from two classes. We evaluate\nthe multiparticle Kalman filter in symmetric and noisy environments. Such\nenvironments are especially challenging for both classes of classical methods.\nWe compare the proposed approach with the particle filter since only this\nmethod is feasible if the initial state is unknown. In the considered\nchallenging environments, our method outperforms the particle filter in terms\nof both localization error and runtime.",

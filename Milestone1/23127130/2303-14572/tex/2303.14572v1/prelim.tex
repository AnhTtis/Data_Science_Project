For integer $n \ge 1$, we use $[n]$ to denote $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ and use $[\pm n]$ to denote $\{-n, -(n-1), \ldots, n\}$. 
For a predicate $X$, we use $[X]$ to denote a $\{0, 1\}$ value which evaluates to $1$ if $X$ is true, and $0$ otherwise. 

We use $M(n_1, n_2, n_3)$ to denote the (randomized) running time to multiply an $n_1 \times n_2$ matrix with an $n_2 \times n_3$ matrix.
We consider the Word-RAM model of computation with $O(\log n)$-bit words, and all input numbers are $O(\log n)$-bit integers, unless otherwise stated. 



\begin{problem}[\MinPlus{}]
Given an $n_1 \times n_2$ matrix $A$ and an $n_2 \times n_3$ matrix $B$, compute the $n_1 \times n_3$ matrix $C$ where $C_{ij} = \min_{k \in [n_2]} (A_{ik}+B_{kj})$. We denote $C$ by $A \star B$. 
\end{problem}

Furthermore, we use $M^*(n_1, n_2, n_3 \mid \ell)$ to denote the (randomized) running time to compute the Min-Plus product between an $n_1 \times n_2$ matrix and an $n_2 \times n_3$ matrix where the entries of both matrices  are from $[\ell] \cup \{\infty\}$.

\begin{problem}[\ThreeSUM{}]

\end{problem}

\begin{problem}[\ThreeSUMConv{}]
Given three arrays of numbers $A, B, C$ of lengths $n$, determine if there exist $i, j \in [n]$ such that $A_i + B_j = C_{i + j}$. In its All-Numbers version (\AllThreeSUMConv{}), we need to determine for each $k \in [n]$, whether there exist $i, j \in [n]$ such that $i + j = k$ and $A_i + B_j = C_k$. 
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}[\MonoConv{}]

\end{problem}


All the problems defined above have natural counting variants, which will be denoted by adding a ``\#'' prefix to the problems' names. For a detection problem that outputs a single bit or multiple bits, each bit represents whether an object that satisfies some requirements exists among a set of candidates; in its counting variant, we need to output a number in place of each bit to denote the number of objects that satisfy the requirements among the same set of candidates. For instance, \ExactTriCount{} asks to count the number of triangles in the graph whose edge weights sum up to $t$, and \AEExactTriCount{} asks to count, for each edge $e$, the number of triangles containing $e$ whose edge weights sum up to $t$. 
For a minimization problem that outputs one or multiple optimal values, its counting variant needs to output the number of optimal solutions in place of each optimal value. For instance, \MinPlusCount{} asks for each $(i, j) \in [n_1] \times [n_3]$, the number of $k$ where $A_{ik}+B_{kj}=(A\star B)_{ij}$. One special problem is the \APSPCountMod{U} problem, in which we need to compute the number of shortest paths mod $U$ for every pair of nodes. 

Clearly, for any of the detection problems, its counting variant is (not necessarily strictly) harder than its original version. The same is not obviously true for minimization problems.

    "abstract": "In this paper we develop explicit and semi-implicit second-order high-resolution finite difference schemes for a structured coagulation-fragmentation model formulated on the space of Radon measures. We prove the convergence of each of the two schemes to the unique weak solution of the model. We perform numerical simulations to demonstrate that the second order accuracy is achieved by both schemes.",

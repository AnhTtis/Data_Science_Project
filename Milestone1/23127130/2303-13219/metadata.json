    "abstract": "We show that extended graph 4-manifolds with positive Euler characteristic cannot support a complex structure. This result stems from a new proof of the fact that a closed real-hyperbolic 4-manifold cannot support a complex structure. Finally, we construct infinitely many extended graph 4-manifolds with positive Euler characteristic which support almost complex structures.",

  abstract = {Thermal camouflage has been successful in the conductive regime, where thermal metamaterials embedded in a conductive system can manipulate heat conduction inside the bulk. Most reported approaches are background-dependent and not applicable to radiative heat emitted from the surface of the system. A coating with engineered emissivity is one option for radiative camouflage, but only when the background has uniform temperature. Here, we propose a strategy for radiative camouflage of external objects on a given background using a structured thermal surface. The device is non-invasive and restores arbitrary background temperature distributions on its top. For many practical candidates of the background material with similar emissivity as the device, the object can thereby be radiatively concealed without a priori knowledge of the host conductivity and temperature. We expect this strategy to meet the demands of anti-detection and thermal radiation manipulation in complex unknown environments and to inspire developments in phononic and photonic thermotronics.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Thermal camouflage utilizes the manipulation of heat fluxes to conceal an arbitrary object in various environments from being detected via thermography. In the past decade, the field of thermal metamaterials and the technique of 3D printing have been rapidly developed, which makes nonintuitive heat flux manipulation feasible. However, when thermal metamaterials are applied to the thermal camouflaging, their conductivities are dependent on the properties of background, leading to the damage of background integrality. Moreover, previous thermal camouflaging schemes have mostly worked in the 2D regime, largely restricting their functional angles and application scenarios, especially in complex environments. Here, wide-angle radiative thermal camouflaging is realized by using a 3D-printed meta-helmet of extremely anisotropic thermal conductivities. Based on 3D coordinate transformation, this meta-helmet directly maps temperature distributions from the background to the metamaterial surface without damaging background integrity. The non-invasive device is efficient in wide-angle thermal camouflage by rendering the same emissivity to the background medium and can self-adjust to various even unknown background thermal fields, which is demonstrated in numerical simulations and experiments. This work opens a door to the 3D transformation-thermotics-based devices for versatile practical applications in thermal infrared stealth of macro-sized objects and others.},

Here, we develop the theory to unsteady-state cases by considering the generalized Fourier's law for transient thermal conduction. As a result, we are allowed to propose a new class of intelligent thermal metamaterial — switchable concentrator, which is made of inhomogeneous anisotropic materials. When environmental temperature is below or above a critical value, the concentrator is automatically switched on, namely, it helps to focus heat flux in a specific region. However, the focusing does not affect the distribution pattern of temperature outside the concentrator. We also perform finite-element simulations to confirm the switching effect according to the effective medium theory by assembling homogeneous isotropic materials, which bring more convenience for experimental fabrication than inhomogeneous anisotropic materials. This work may help to figure out new intelligent thermal devices, which provide more flexibility in controlling heat flow, and it may also be useful in other fields that are sensitive to temperature gradient, such as the Seebeck effect.},

  abstract = {Abstract “Fata Morgana” or “Mirage” phenomena have long been captivated as optical illusions, which actually relies on gradient-density air or vapor. Man-made optical illusions have witnessed significant progress by resorting to artificially structured metamaterials. Nevertheless, two long-standing challenges remain formidable: first, exotic parameters (negative or less than unity) become inevitable; second, the signature of original object is altered to that of a virtual counterpart. It is thus not able to address the holy grail of illusion per se, since a single virtual object still exposes the location. In this study, those problems are successfully addressed in a particular setup—illusion thermotics, which identically mimics the exterior thermal behavior of an equivalent reference and splits the interior original heat source into many virtual signatures. A general paradigm to design thermal illusion metadevices is proposed to manipulate thermal conduction, and empower robust simultaneous functions of moving, shaping, rotating, and splitting heat sources of arbitrary cross sections. The temperature profile inside the thermal metadevice can mislead the awareness of the real location, shape, size, and number of the actual heat sources. The present concept may trigger unprecedented development in other physical fields to realize multiple functionalized illusions in optics, electromagnetics, etc.},

  abstract = {Abstract Janus metamaterials, metasurfaces, and monolayers have received intensive attention in nanophotonics and 2D materials. Their core concept is to introduce asymmetry along the wave propagation direction, by stacking different materials or layers of meta-atoms, or breaking out-of-plane mirror asymmetry with external biases. Nevertheless, it has been hitherto elusive to realize a diffusive Janus metadevice, since scalar diffusion systems such as heat conduction normally operate in the absence of polarization control, spin manipulation, or electric-field stimuli, which all are widely used in achieving optical Janus devices. It is even more challenging, if not impossible, for a single diffusive metadevice to exhibit more than two thermal functions. Here a path-dependent thermal metadevice beyond Janus characteristics is proposed, which can exhibit three distinct thermal behaviors (cloaking, concentrating, and transparency) under different directions of heat flow. The rotation transformation mechanism of thermal conductivity provides a robust platform to assign a specific thermal behavior in any direction. The proof-of-concept experiment of anisotropic in-plane conduction successfully validates such a path-dependent trifunction thermal metamaterial device. It is anticipated that this path-dependent strategy can provide a new dimension for multifunctional metamaterial devices in the thermal field, as well as for a more general diffusion process.},

To surmount these barriers, heat-enhanced thermal diffusion metamaterials powered by deep learning is introduced. Such active metamaterials can automatically sense ambient temperatures and swiftly, as well as continuously, adjust their thermal functions with a high degree of tunability. They maintain robust thermal performance even when external thermal fields change direction, and both simulations and experiments demonstrate exceptional results. Furthermore, two metadevices with on-demand adaptability, performing distinctive features with isotropic materials, wide working temperatures, and spontaneous response are designed. This work offers a framework for the design of intelligent thermal diffusion metamaterials and can be expanded to other diffusion fields, adapting to increasingly complex and dynamic environments.},

  abstract = {Many complex systems operate with loss. Mathematically, these systems can be described as non-Hermitian. A property of such a system is that there can exist certain conditions—exceptional points—where gain and loss can be perfectly balanced and exotic behavior is predicted to occur. Optical systems generally possess gain and loss and so are ideal systems for exploring exceptional point physics. Miri and Alù review the topic of exceptional points in photonics and explore some of the possible exotic behavior that might be expected from engineering such systems. Science, this issue p. eaar7709 Exceptional points are branch point singularities in the parameter space of a system at which two or more eigenvalues, and their corresponding eigenvectors, coalesce and become degenerate. Such peculiar degeneracies are distinct features of non-Hermitian systems, which do not obey conservation laws because they exchange energy with the surrounding environment. Non-Hermiticity has been of great interest in recent years, particularly in connection with the quantum mechanical notion of parity-time symmetry, after the realization that Hamiltonians satisfying this special symmetry can exhibit entirely real spectra. These concepts have become of particular interest in photonics because optical gain and loss can be integrated and controlled with high resolution in nanoscale structures, realizing an ideal playground for non-Hermitian physics, parity-time symmetry, and exceptional points. As we control dissipation and amplification in a nanophotonic system, the emergence of exceptional point singularities dramatically alters their overall response, leading to a range of exotic optical functionalities associated with abrupt phase transitions in the eigenvalue spectrum. These concepts enable ultrasensitive measurements, superior manipulation of the modal content of multimode lasers, and adiabatic control of topological energy transfer for mode and polarization conversion. Non-Hermitian degeneracies have also been exploited in exotic laser systems, new nonlinear optics schemes, and exotic scattering features in open systems. Here we review the opportunities offered by exceptional point physics in photonics, discuss recent developments in theoretical and experimental research based on photonic exceptional points, and examine future opportunities in this area from basic science to applied technology.},

Coherent perfect absorption is such an effect that enables all-light control by incorporating a suitable amount of loss. On the other hand, controlling heat transfer with heat may empower a distinct paradigm other than using thermal metamaterials. However, since heat neither propagates nor carries any momentum, almost all concepts in wave scattering are ill-defined for steady-state heat diffusion, making it formidable to understand or utilize any coherent effect. Here, we establish a scattering theory for heat diffusion by introducing an imitated momentum for thermal fields. The thermal analogue of coherent perfect absorption is thus predicted and demonstrated as the perfect absorption of exergy fluxes and undisturbed temperature fields. Unlike its photonic counterpart, thermal coherent perfect absorption can be realized for regular thermal materials, and be generalized for various objects.},

  abstract = {Phase modulation has scarcely been mentioned in diffusive physical systems because the diffusion process does not carry the momentum like waves. Recently, non-Hermitian physics provides a unique perspective for understanding diffusion and shows prospects in thermal phase regulation, exemplified by the discovery of anti-parity-time (APT) symmetry in diffusive systems. However, precise control of thermal phase remains elusive hitherto and can hardly be realized, due to the phase oscillations. Here we construct the PT-symmetric diffusive systems to achieve the complete suppression of thermal phase oscillation. The real coupling of diffusive fields is readily established through a strong convective background, and the decay-rate detuning is enabled by thermal metamaterial design. We observe the phase transition of PT symmetry breaking with the symmetry-determined amplitude and phase regulation of coupled temperature fields. Our work shows the existence of PT symmetry in dissipative energy exchanges and provides unique approaches for harnessing the mass transfer of particles, wave dynamics in strongly scattering systems, and thermal conduction. Precise thermal phase control is experimentally verified in PT symmetric diffusive systems.},

  abstract = {Abstract Many unusual wave phenomena in artificial structures are governed by their topological properties. However, the topology of diffusion remains almost unexplored. One reason is that diffusion is fundamentally different from wave propagation because of its purely dissipative nature. The other is that the diffusion field is mostly composed of modes that extend over wide ranges, making it difficult to be rendered within the tight-binding theory as commonly employed in wave physics. Here, the above challenges are overcome and systematic studies are performed on the topology of heat diffusion. Based on a continuum model, the band structure and geometric phase are analytically obtained without using the tight-binding approximation. A deterministic parameter is found to link the geometric phase with the edge state, thereby proving the bulk-boundary correspondence for heat diffusion. The topological edge state is experimentally demonstrated as localized heat diffusion and its dependence on the boundary conditions is verified. This approach is general, rigorous, and able to reveal rich knowledge about the system with great accuracy. The findings set up a solid foundation to explore the topology in novel thermal management applications.},

The thermal energy transported by each disk is strongly coupled to the disk rotating in the opposite direction, providing a return path for the heat wave. For a particular rotation rate, there is an exceptional point where thermal coupling and counterrotating motion balance, resulting in the thermal energy profile being stationary over time. Science, this issue p. 170 Symmetry considerations can help protect heat from being carried away by moving objects. Various concepts related to parity-time symmetry, including anti–parity-time symmetry, have found broad applications in wave physics. Wave systems are fundamentally described by Hermitian operators, whereas their unusual properties are introduced by incorporation of gain and loss. We propose that the related physics need not be restricted to wave dynamics, and we consider systems described by diffusive dynamics. We study the heat transfer in two countermoving media and show that this system exhibits anti–parity-time symmetry. The spontaneous symmetry breaking results in a phase transition from motionless temperature profiles, despite the mechanical motion of the background, to moving temperature profiles. Our results extend the concepts of parity-time symmetry beyond wave physics and may offer opportunities to manipulate heat and mass transport.},

  abstract = {Thermal diffusion is dissipative and strongly related to non-Hermitian physics. At the same time, non-Hermitian Weyl systems have spurred tremendous interest across photonics and acoustics. This correlation has been long ignored and hence shed little light upon the question of whether the Weyl exceptional ring (WER) in thermal diffusion could exist. Intuitively, thermal diffusion provides no real parameter dimensions, thus prohibiting a topological nature and WER. This work breaks this perception by imitating synthetic dimensions via two spatiotemporal advection pairs. The WER is achieved in thermal diffusive systems. Both surface-like and bulk states are demonstrated by coupling two WERs with opposite topological charges. These findings extend topological notions to diffusions and motivate investigation of non-Hermitian diffusive and dissipative control. A non-Hermitian Weyl equation indispensably requires a three-dimensional (3D) real/synthetic space, and it is thereby perceived that a Weyl exceptional ring (WER) will not be present in thermal diffusion given its purely dissipative nature. Here, we report a recipe for establishing a 3D parameter space to imitate thermal spinor field. Two orthogonal pairs of spatiotemporally modulated advections are employed to serve as two synthetic parameter dimensions, in addition to the inherent dimension corresponding to heat exchanges. We first predict the existence of WER in our hybrid conduction–advection system and experimentally observe the WER thermal signatures verifying our theoretical prediction. When coupling two WERs of opposite topological charges, the system further exhibits surface-like and bulk topological states, manifested as stationary and continuously changing thermal processes, respectively, with good robustness. Our findings reveal the long-ignored topological nature in thermal diffusion and may empower distinct paradigms for general diffusion and dissipation controls.},

However, constrained by the inherent temperature-dependent properties and the law of mass conservation, previous works have been compelled to treat dynamic and steady-state cases separately. Here, by establishing a unified thermal scattering theory, the creation of a convection-based thermal metadevice which supports both dynamic and steady-state nonreciprocal heat circulation is reported. The nontrivial dependence between the nonreciprocal resonance peaks and the dynamic parameters is observed and the unique nonreciprocal mechanism of multiple scattering is revealed at steady state. This mechanism enables thermal nonreciprocity in the initially quasi-symmetric scattering matrix of the three-port metadevice and has been experimentally validated with a significant isolation ratio of heat fluxes. The findings establish a framework for thermal nonreciprocity that can be smoothly modulated for dynamic and steady-state heat signals, it may also offer insight into other heat-transfer-related problems or even other fields such as acoustics and mechanics.},

The concept of infrared-transparent visible-opaque fabric (ITVOF) is first highlighted, as it triggers the work on advanced PTM by combining it with radiative cooling, and the corresponding implementations and realizations are subsequently introduced, followed by wearable heaters, flexible thermoelectric devices, and sweat-management Janus textiles. Finally, critical considerations on the challenges and opportunities of PTM are presented and future directions are identified, including thermally conductive polymers and fibers, physiological/psychological statistical analysis, and smart PTM strategies.},

Conventional thermal metamaterials are predominantly designed with tractable regular geometries owing to the delicate analytical solution and easy-to-implement effective structures. Nevertheless, it is challenging to achieve the design of thermal metamaterials with arbitrary geometry, letting alone intelligent (automatic, real-time, and customizable) design of thermal metamaterials. Here, an intelligent design framework of thermal metamaterials is presented via a pre-trained deep learning model, which gracefully achieves the desired functional structures of thermal metamaterials with exceptional speed and efficiency, regardless of arbitrary geometry. It possesses incomparable versatility and is of great flexibility to achieve the corresponding design of thermal metamaterials with different background materials, anisotropic geometries, and thermal functionalities. The transformation thermotics-induced, freeform, background-independent, and omnidirectional thermal cloaks, whose structural configurations are automatically designed in real-time according to shape and background, are numerically and experimentally demonstrated. This study sets up a novel paradigm for an automatic and real-time design of thermal metamaterials in a new design scenario. More generally, it may open a door to the realization of an intelligent design of metamaterials in also other physical domains.},

However, the previously reported low-infrared-emissivity materials have the bottleneck of lacking independent control over visible optical properties. Here, a novel visibly transparent and infrared reflective (VTIR) coating by exploiting a nano-mesh patterning strategy with an oxide–metal–oxide tri-layer structure is reported. The VTIR coating shows simultaneously high transmittance in the visible region (>80\% at 550 nm) and low emissivity in the mid-infrared region (< 20\% in 7–14 µm). The VTIR coating not only achieves a radiative heating effect of 6.6 °C for indoor conditions but also enables a synergetic effect with photothermal materials to keep human body warm at freezing temperatures for outdoor conditions, which is 10–15 °C warmer than normal cotton and Mylar film. Moreover, it demonstrates an excellent thermal camouflage effect at various temperatures (34–250 °C) and good compatibility with visible camouflage on the same object, making it ideal for both daytime and nighttime cloaking. With its unique and versatile spectral features, this novel VTIR design has great potential to make a significant impact on personal heat management and counter-surveillance applications.},

Ideally, a thermal metamaterial should be able to simultaneously and independently manipulate both the conductive and convective heat flows. However, such thermal metamaterials have not yet been realized so far. Here, we report on experimental realization of such thermal metamaterials, which are achieved via a design of liquid–solid hybrid thermal metamaterials to support thermal convection and conduction as well as their transformations with a topology transition. These findings may promote the regulation of local hot/cold spots in living cells or biological tissues without disturbing the human body’s environment. Thermal metamaterials provide rich control of heat transport which is becoming the foundation of cutting-edge applications ranging from chip cooling to biomedical. However, due to the fundamental laws of physics, the manipulation of heat is much more constrained in conventional thermal metamaterials where effective heat conduction with Onsager reciprocity dominates. Here, through the inclusion of thermal convection and breaking the Onsager reciprocity, we unveil a regime in thermal metamaterials and transformation thermotics that goes beyond effective heat conduction. By designing a liquid–solid hybrid thermal metamaterial, we demonstrate a continuous switch from thermal cloaking to thermal concentration in one device with external tuning. Underlying such a switch is a topology transition in the virtual space of the thermotic transformation which is achieved by tuning the liquid flow via external control. These findings illustrate the extraordinary heat transport in complex multicomponent thermal metamaterials and pave the way toward an unprecedented regime of heat manipulation.},

However, existing design paradigms do not apply to thermal-mechanical metamaterials that operate on thermal and mechanical fields simultaneously and independently. First, Due to the different geometric requirements imposed by the thermal and mechanical fields on the unit cells, there is a conflict between functional coupling and design coupling, which limits the design of thermal-mechanical metamaterials. Second, the fact that continuum mechanical equations do not remain invariant under general coordinate transformations hinders the application of conventional theories. Additionally, balancing minimal design costs, manufacturability, and optimal functionality remains a significant challenge. Here, we propose a global data-driven design method using Bayesian hyperparameter optimization. This method creates thermal-mechanical metamaterials from a large, pre-computed unit cell database. Our flexible method allows designing thermal-mechanical metamaterials with various functional combinations (e.g., cloaks, concentrators, and rotators) and shapes. Compared to traditional solutions, this approach balances manufacturability and functionality while offering unparalleled universality and low design costs. Experimental measurements validate the effectiveness of our method. Our approach can rapidly respond to new design scenarios and address design challenges related to the multi-physical effects.},

  abstract = {Temperature control in enclosed spaces typically depends on air conditioning and district heating, leading to high energy consumption in buildings. Enhancing energy efficiency in these systems has garnered growing attention. Thermal nonreciprocal metamaterials offer a promising solution by efficiently directing heat flow, significantly improving energy efficiency. However, traditional nonreciprocal devices with fixed outputs and narrow temperature ranges are limited in practicality. Here, we utilize often-overlooked natural convection in asymmetric structures, revealing a nonreciprocal design with a tunable output across a broad temperature range. This device requires no extra energy, operating solely on ambient temperature differences. These advancements enhance the practicality of thermal nonreciprocity and open avenues for designing energy-efficient materials. Thermal nonreciprocity plays a vital role in chip heat dissipation, energy-saving design, and high-temperature hyperthermia, typically realized through the use of advanced metamaterials with nonlinear, advective, spatiotemporal, or gradient properties. However, challenges such as fixed structural designs with limited adjustability, high energy consumption, and a narrow operational temperature range remain prevalent. Here, a systematic framework is introduced to achieve reconfigurable, zero-energy, and wide-temperature thermal nonreciprocity by transforming wasteful heat loss into a valuable regulatory tool. Vertical slabs composed of natural bulk materials enable asymmetric heat loss through natural convection, disrupting the inversion symmetry of thermal conduction. The reconfigurability of this system stems from the ability to modify heat loss by adjusting thermal conductivity, size, placement, and quantity of the slabs. Moreover, this structure allows for precise control of zero-energy thermal nonreciprocity across a broad temperature spectrum, utilizing solely environmental temperature gradients without additional energy consumption. This research presents a different approach to achieving nonreciprocity, broadening the potential for nonreciprocal devices such as thermal diodes and topological edge states, and inspiring further exploration of nonreciprocity in other loss-based systems.},

First, objects are typically completely enclosed in traditional cloaks, making them difficult to use and unsuitable for objects with heat sources. Second, although some theoretical proposals have been put forth to change the thermal conductivity of materials to achieve dynamic invisibility, their designs are complex and rigid, making them unsuitable for large-scale use in real three-dimensional (3D) spaces.

It features a reconfigurable structure, constructed with simple isotropic natural materials, making it suitable for dynamic requirements. The performance of our reconfigurable thermal dome has been confirmed through simulations and experiments, consistent with the theory. The introduction of this concept can greatly advance the development of thermal invisibility technology from theory to engineering and provide inspiration for other physical domains, such as direct current electric fields and magnetic fields.},

  abstract = {Non-Hermitian wave system has attracted intense attentions in the past decade since it reveals interesting physics and generates various counterintuitive effects. However, in the diffusive system that is inherently non-Hermitian with natural dissipation, the robust control of heat flow is hitherto still a challenge. Here we introduce the skin effect into diffusive systems. Different from the skin effect in wave systems, where asymmetric couplings were enabled by dynamic modulations or judicious gain/loss engineering, asymmetric couplings of the temperature fields in diffusive systems can be realized by directly contacted metamaterial channels. Topological heat funneling is further presented, where the temperature field automatically concentrates towards a designated position and shows a strong immunity against the defects. Our work indicates that the diffusive system can provide a distinctive platform for exploring non-Hermitian physics as well as thermal topology.},

  abstract = {Non-Hermitian systems associated with exceptional points (EPs) are expected to demonstrate a giant response enhancement for various sensors. The widely investigated enhancement mechanism based on diverging from an EP should destroy the EP and further limits its applications for multiple sensing scenarios in a time sequence. To break the above limit, here, we proposed a new enhanced sensing mechanism based on shifting an EP. Different from the mechanism of diverging from an EP, our scheme is an EP nondemolition and the giant enhancement of response is acquired by a slight shift of the EP along the parameter axis induced by perturbation. The new sensing mechanism can promise the most effective response enhancement for all sensors in the case of multiple sensing in a time sequence. To verify our sensing mechanism, we construct a mass sensor and a gyroscope with concrete physical implementations. Our work will deepen the understanding of EP-based sensing and inspire designing various high-sensitivity sensors in different physical systems.},

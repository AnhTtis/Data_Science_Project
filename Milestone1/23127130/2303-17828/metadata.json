    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the strong global attractors for a three dimensional nonclassical diffusion equation with memory. First, we prove the existence and uniqueness of strong solutions for the equations by the Galerkin method. Then we prove the existence of global attractors for the equations in $H^2(Ω)\\cap H^1_0(Ω)\\times L^2_μ(\\mathbb{R}^+;H^2(Ω)\\cap H^1_0(Ω))$ by the condition (C).",

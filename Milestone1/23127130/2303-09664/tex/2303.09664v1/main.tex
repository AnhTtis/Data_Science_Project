  \name provides a critical inspection of group differences to facilitate accountable group analytics with a visual analytic suite. It allows users to (a) visually contrast groups' main characteristics (\grouptrend), (b) examine the within-group variance (\variscope), (c) capture group-level attribute importance (\depscope), (d) retrieve qualitative language details (\languagescope), and (e) explore nested patterns and diversity within a group. It also supports users to (g) assess the analytic model quality against ground-truth data whenever available (\evalscope), and (f) obtain the rationale behind the group assignment of any individual instance (\rationalescope).

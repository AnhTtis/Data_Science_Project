    "abstract": "Let $G$ be a connected and simply-connected semisimple group over $\\mathbf{C}$, let $G_c$ be a maximal compact subgroup of $G(\\mathbf{C})$, and let $T$ be a maximal torus. The derived geometric Satake equivalence of Bezrukavnikov-Finkelberg localizes to an equivalence between a full subcategory of $\\mathrm{Loc}_{G_c}(ΩG_c; \\mathbf{C})$ and $\\mathrm{QCoh}(\\check{\\mathfrak{g}}^{\\mathrm{reg}}[2]/\\check{G})$, which can be thought of as a version of the geometric Satake equivalence \"over the regular locus\". In this article, we study the story when $\\mathrm{Loc}_{T_c}(ΩG_c; \\mathbf{C})$ is replaced by the $\\infty$-category of $T$-equivariant local systems of $A$-modules over $\\mathrm{Gr}_G(\\mathbf{C})$, where $A$ is a complex-oriented even-periodic $\\mathbf{E}_\\infty$-ring equipped with an oriented group scheme $\\mathbf{G}$. We show that upon rationalization, $\\mathrm{Loc}_{T_c}(ΩG_c; A)$, which was studied variously by Arkhipov-Bezrukavnikov-Ginzburg and Yun-Zhu when $A = \\mathbf{C}[β^{\\pm 1}]$, can be described in terms of the spectral geometry of various Langlands-dual stacks associated to $A$ and $\\mathbf{G}$. For example, this implies that if $A$ is an elliptic cohomology theory with elliptic curve $E$, then $\\mathrm{Loc}_{T_c}(ΩG_c; A) \\otimes \\mathbf{Q}$ can be described via the moduli stack of $\\check{B}$-bundles of degree $0$ on $E^\\vee$.",

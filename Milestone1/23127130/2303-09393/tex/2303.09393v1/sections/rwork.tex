To the best our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal study of NFT ecosystem that focuses on identifying and characterizing market
movers from a financial point of view.
Wang \textit{et al.}~\cite{wang2021non} provides an overview of the NFT ecosystem with regard to the technical components, etc. Our work is different in that we analyze how NFT market operates from a financial standpoint.
Dowling \textit{et al.}~\cite{dowling2022non} and Ante \textit{et al.}~\cite{ante2021non} study correlation between price of NFTs and cryptocurrencies, and shows that they have a low correlation. 
Distinct from their works, we focus on the NFT market driven by traders. 
Brunet \textit{et al.}~\cite{casale2021networks} and Nandi \textit{et al.}~\cite{nadini2021mapping} study the basic topological structure of NFT trading networks and show that each is similar to other social networks. 
% Also, they analyze temporal behaviors in each collection in terms of average wallet value, unique wallets, etc.
% However, they only cover a few collections and study characteristics within each collection. 
Das \textit{et al.}~\cite{das2021understanding} presents a systematic overview of how the NFT ecosystem works and uncovers potential security issues. 
Wachter \textit{et al.}~\cite{von2022nft} also examines potentially illicit trading patterns in the NFT market with two detection algorithms and their effect on price. Still, there is no understanding on how malicious behaviors have changed over time and analysis on the performers of wash trading.

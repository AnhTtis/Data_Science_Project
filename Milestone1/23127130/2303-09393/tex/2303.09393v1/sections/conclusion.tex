Following the rapid growth of cryptocurrencies, NFTs have recently received wide attention from the public. Many participants have successfully traded NFT items with financial gain, leading to the emergence of NFT whales. However, many participants suffer from the lack of a clear viewpoint on the NFT ecosystem.
In this research, we perform the first longitudinal study to construct in-depth analysis on the NFT market, focusing on unique activities of market participants including whales and market movements. Specifically, we reveal whales on the NFT ecosystem and discover that they possess unique strategies to maximize their earnings from NFT trades and greatly impact the entire market. 
Consequently, we believe that our findings and insight in this work shed light on the NFT ecosystem, which has been minimally investigated to date.

% The term NFT and cryptocurrency seems very similar from outside due to their similarities, e.g., built upon blockchain, traded with cryptocurrency, etc. Due to this, people tend to regard two the same and even do not distinguish their ecosystem \cite{nft_and_crypto}. However, unlike common cryptocurrency, NFT is `non-fungible' thus cannot be traded or exchanged at equivalency. Due to this difference, trader simply having large quantity of NFTs does not lead to large holding value, which is very different from having large number of fungible tokens, e.g., Bitcoin. 

% Meanwhile, a term `Bitcoin whale' usually refers to individuals or entities that hold large amounts of Bitcoin \cite{bitcoin_whale}. 
% Here, the word `whale' is used because their movements can fluctuate the water that smaller fish swim in together. Through many reports, the influence of whales turn out to be huge in the market, even being able to manipulate Bitcoin price up and down just by placing orders \cite{bitcoin_whale, bitcoin_whale2, bitcoin_whale3}. The term whale also exists in NFT market. In fact, NFTGo, one of most popular NFT analysis platform defines trading group including whales and explains some aspects of their trading. According to the report in NFTGo, NFT whales are very influential beings in the market, being capable of creating a chain reaction that affects other investors \cite{nft_whale}. However, their analysis on whales are yet shallow, only providing recent statistics with no further explanation on their behavior nor impact to other traders. Indeed, other than this platform, no websites nor study focus on NFT whales despite their huge impact.

% NFTGo~\cite{}, one of most popular NFT analysis platform, evaluates the value of NFTs in each wallet to rank top NFT holders. \cmt{[MORE RELATED WORK]} However, their limited statistics only provide simple statistics such as how much each trader holds specific amount of NFT values, popular NFTs recently sold out, and trading statistics of each NFT. Previous studies are quite limited to provide specific statistics focused on each NFT. Importantly, no prior work has addressed the question about NFT market in financial perspectives: \textit{Who is the key player to manipulate NFT price?}, \textit{How much they have earned from NFT trades?}, \textit{Does they have unique strategies to beat the NFT market?}.

% In this paper, to best our knowledge, we perform the first longitudinal study to provide in-depth analysis on NFT market, focusing on identifying and characterizing market movers in financial perspectives. To conduct this research, we first collect event logs in NFT smart contracts~\cite{event_logs} and extract trading information in terms of NFT life-cycle: (i) mint, (ii) transfer, (iii) sale, and (iv) burn. Then, we estimate how much value has been transferred through the NFT trades based on the market price at the time of each transaction. In total, we found 441.4k traders in top 91 popular NFT collections.

Cryptocurrency, which has recorded a phenomenal growth in the past decade, has now become one of the most popular investment options. Successfully demonstrating the potential of its underlying blockchain technology as well as its enormous profitability, other blockchain-based digital assets have also emerged as alternative, life-changing investment opportunities. 

Following the huge success of cryptocurrencies, public attention toward NFTs has exploded. Many investors have traded NFT collectibles for financial gain, and eventually, the \emph{whales} appeared on the market. 
The term \emph{whale} has become a commonly accepted designation in the blockchain community. For example, in the cryptocurrency market, Satoshi Nakamoto and the Winkelvoss Brothers are often referred to as \emph{Bitcoin whales}. They own an exceptionally large amount of Bitcoins enough to impact the entire market as previously measured. ~\cite{bitcoin_whale, bitcoin_whale2, bitcoin_whale3}.

NFT whales can be easily monitored on commercial NFT analytics platforms~\cite{nftgo, nftbank} available today. For instance, NFTGo~\cite{nftgo}, one of the most popular NFT analytics platforms, evaluates the total value of the NFTs in each NFT holder's wallet and publishes a list of whales. The purpose of this feature is to provide useful investment information for potential NFT buyers who wish to follow the whales' investment pattern. As such, the movement of NFT whales, which may be potentially driving the market, may provide useful insights or lessons; however, neither whale-following investment strategy nor other aspects of NFT whales have been thoroughly studied.

To gain a deeper understanding of obscure NFT whales, we ask the following questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item What are the characteristics of NFT whales?
    \item What are the investment strategies of NFT whales?
    \item Are NFT whales successful investors?
    \item Are NFT whales really powerful enough to impact the entire NFT market?
\end{itemize}

This paper dives deeply into the newly emerging NFT market to reveal and understand NFT whales for the first time. We collect the transaction logs from NFT smart contracts~\cite{event_logs} and align the data according to the NFT life-cycle: (i) mint, (ii) transfer/sale, and (iii) burn. Then, we estimate how much value has been transferred through NFT trades based on the market price at the time of each transaction. As a result, we are able to identify 430K traders involved in the top 91 NFT collections.

Below are the significant findings of this paper:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Most high-value NFTs are owned by NFT whales. 
  \item NFT whales rarely sell NFTs while eagerly buying the highest priced NFTs (top 1 percent)
  \item NFT whales are indeed the most profitable group.
  \item NFT whales take advantage of wash trading. 
\end{itemize}

The findings of this longitudinal measurement study have given us a lesson regarding the NFT market. Our study has shown that NFT whales have been powerful enough to manipulate the entire market. In other words, the NFT market itself is still immature and unstable. 
Furthermore, we also observe that the whales have been abusing weaknesses of the NFT market to inflate the value of the NFTs they own. In order to establish a mature and stable NFT market, the existing regulatory and legal environments must adapt to include NFT. It is also recommended to implement security countermeasures to protect the market from any abusive behaviors. 

% The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section \ref{s:background} summarizes the background on NFT and definition of traders including whales. We describe the data collection and manipulation process in Section \ref{s:data}. In sections \ref{s:basic}, \ref{s:impact}, \ref{s:strategy}, and \ref{s:profit}, we answer each research question in detail along with several case studies. Then, we conclude our paper with discussion, related work and conclusion in Section \ref{s:discussion}, \ref{s:rw} and \ref{s:conclusion}, respectively.

In summary, the first measurement of the angle between the WTA and Standard or Soft Drop groomed charged-particle jet axes in \PbPb{} collisions is reported. The measurement was carried out using 0$\textendash$10\% most-central collisions at $\sqrts = 5.02$ TeV with the ALICE detector and for $\pTchjet \in [40,140]$ ([80,140]) \GeVc{} for jets of $R=0.2$ ($0.4$).

Narrowing of the \DeltaR{} distribution relative to the vacuum case is found. The narrowing may be explained if 
the \PbPb{} distribution is dominated by quark-initiated jets, since gluon-initiated jets are expected to interact more with the medium. This is consistent with the prediction from the ``medium q/g'' model.
The measurement disfavors 
intra-jet \pT{} broadening, as implemented in 
Ref.~\citenum{Ringer:2019rfk}.

The \DeltaR{} observables exhibit sensitivity to the medium resolution length. The measurement favors incoherent energy loss of jets, where the medium resolves a splitting immediately after it happens, regardless of the angular separation between the prongs.
Future measurements of \DeltaR{} in photon- or Z-boson-tagged jets could provide a way to experimentally vary the fraction of quark- vs. gluon-initiated jets.

    "abstract": "Gravitational redshift is discussed in the context of quantum photons propagating in curved spacetime. A brief introduction to modelling realistic photons is first presented and the effect of gravity on the spectrum computed for photons largely confined along the direction of propagation. It is then shown that redshift-induced transformations on photon operators with sharp momenta are not unitary, while a unitary transformation can be constructed for realistic photons with finite bandwidth. The unitary transformation obtained is then characterized as a multimode mixing operation, which is a generalized rotation of the Hilbert-space basis. Finally, applications of these results are discussed with focus on performance of quantum communication protocols, exploitation of the effects for quantum metrology and sensing, as well as potential for tests of fundamental science.",

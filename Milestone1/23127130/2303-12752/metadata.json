    "abstract": "Given an open neighborhood $W$ of the zero section in the cotangent bundle of $N$ we define a distance-like function $ρ_W$ on $N$ using certain symplectic embeddings from the standard ball $B^{2n}(r)$ to $W$. We show that when $W$ is the unit disc-cotangent bundle of a Riemannian metric on $N$, $ρ_W$ recovers the metric. As an intermediate step, we give a new construction of the ball of capacity 4 to the product of Lagrangian discs $P_L := B^n(1)\\times B^n(1)$, and we give a new proof of the strong Viterbo conjecture about normalized capacities for $P_L$. We also give bounds of the symplectic packing number of two balls in a unit disc-cotangent bundle relative to the zero section $N$.",

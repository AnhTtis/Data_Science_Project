abstract = {Virtual assistants such as Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, and Google Assistant often rely on a semantic parsing component to understand which action(s) to execute for an utterance spoken by its users. Traditionally, rule-based or statistical slot-filling systems have been used to parse “simple” queries; that is, queries that contain a single action and can be decomposed into a set of non-overlapping entities. More recently, shift-reduce parsers have been proposed to process more complex utterances. These methods, while powerful, impose specific limitations on the type of queries that can be parsed; namely, they require a query to be representable as a parse tree. In this work, we propose a unified architecture based on Sequence to Sequence models and Pointer Generator Network to handle both simple and complex queries. Unlike other works, our approach does not impose any restriction on the semantic parse schema. Furthermore, experiments show that it achieves state of the art performance on three publicly available datasets (ATIS, SNIPS, Facebook TOP), relatively improving between 3.3% and 7.7% in exact match accuracy over previous systems. Finally, we show the effectiveness of our approach on two internal datasets.},

    abstract = "With the proliferation of models for natural language processing tasks, it is even harder to understand the differences between models and their relative merits. Simply looking at differences between holistic metrics such as accuracy, BLEU, or F1 does not tell us why or how particular methods perform differently and how diverse datasets influence the model design choices. In this paper, we present a general methodology for interpretable evaluation for the named entity recognition (NER) task. The proposed evaluation method enables us to interpret the differences in models and datasets, as well as the interplay between them, identifying the strengths and weaknesses of current systems. By making our analysis tool available, we make it easy for future researchers to run similar analyses and drive progress in this area: https://github.com/neulab/InterpretEval",

abstract = {Virtual assistants such as Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, and Google Assistant often rely on a semantic parsing component to understand which action(s) to execute for an utterance spoken by its users. Traditionally, rule-based or statistical slot-filling systems have been used to parse “simple” queries; that is, queries that contain a single action and can be decomposed into a set of non-overlapping entities. More recently, shift-reduce parsers have been proposed to process more complex utterances. These methods, while powerful, impose specific limitations on the type of queries that can be parsed; namely, they require a query to be representable as a parse tree. In this work, we propose a unified architecture based on Sequence to Sequence models and Pointer Generator Network to handle both simple and complex queries. Unlike other works, our approach does not impose any restriction on the semantic parse schema. Furthermore, experiments show that it achieves state of the art performance on three publicly available datasets (ATIS, SNIPS, Facebook TOP), relatively improving between 3.3% and 7.7% in exact match accuracy over previous systems. Finally, we show the effectiveness of our approach on two internal datasets.},

We prove that given a polytope P and a strictly interior point a ε P, there is a projective transformation of the space that maps P, a to P', a' having the following property. The ratio of the radius of the smallest sphere with center a', containing P' to the radius of the largest sphere with center a' contained in P' is O (n). The algorithm consists of repeated application of such projective transformations each followed by optimization over an inscribed sphere to create a sequence of points which converges to the optimal solution in polynomial-time.},

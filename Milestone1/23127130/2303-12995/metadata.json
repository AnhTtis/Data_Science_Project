    "abstract": "We establish a new approach to obtain 3-manifold invariants via Dehn surgery. For this, we introduce skew-racks with good involution and Property FR, and define cocycle invariants as 3-manifold invariants. We also define some link invariants in the 3-sphere which are invariant up to link-homotopic.",

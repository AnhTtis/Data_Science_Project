    "abstract": "The answers for Feynman diagrams satisfy various kinds of differential equations -- which is not a surprise, because they are defined as Gaussian correlators, possessing a vast variety of Ward identities and superintegrability properties. We study these equations in the simplest example of banana diagrams. They contain any number of loops, but can be efficiently handled in position rather than momentum representation, where loop integrals do not show up. We derive equations for the case of scalar fields, explain their origins and drastic simplification at coincident masses. To further simplify the story we do not consider coincident points, i.e. ignore delta-function contributions and ultraviolet divergences for the most part. The equations in this case reduce to homogeneous and have as many solutions as there are different Green functions -- $2^n$ for $n$ loops in quadratic theory, what reduces to just $n+1$ for coincident masses, i.e. for a single field. We comment on the recovery of the delta-functions directly from the homogeneous equations and also compare our result with momentum space formulas known in the literature.",

abstract="Handwritten text recognition has been developed rapidly in the recent years, following the rise of deep learning and its applications. Though deep learning methods provide notable boost in performance concerning text recognition, non-trivial deviation in performance can be detected even when small pre-processing or architectural/optimization elements are changed. This work follows a ``best practice'' rationale; highlight simple yet effective empirical practices that can further help training and provide well-performing handwritten text recognition systems. Specifically, we considered three basic aspects of a deep HTR system and we proposed simple yet effective solutions: 1) retain the aspect ratio of the images in the preprocessing step, 2) use max-pooling for converting the 3D feature map of CNN output into a sequence of features and 3) assist the training procedure via an additional CTC loss which acts as a shortcut on the max-pooled sequential features. Using these proposed simple modifications, one can attain close to state-of-the-art results, while considering a basic convolutional-recurrent (CNN+LSTM) architecture, for both IAM and RIMES datasets.

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of sequential matching in a stochastic block model with several classes of nodes and generic compatibility constraints. When the probabilities of connections do not scale with the size of the graph, we show that under the NCOND condition, a simple max-weight type policy allows to attain an asymptotically perfect matching while no sequential algorithm attain perfect matching otherwise. The proof relies on a specific Markovian representation of the dynamics associated with Lyapunov techniques.",

    "abstract": "Analytically, without magnetostatic approximation, the problem of electromagnetic wave propagation along arbitrary direction in a tangentially magnetized bihyrotropic layer has been solved. It is found that one can bring the Maxwell equations for this problem to the fourth order differential equation and the obtained biquadratic characteristic equation determines two different wave numbers kx21 and kx22 describing the wave distribution over the layer thickness. The dispersion equation describing wave propagation in the bihyrotropic layer was obtained for the case of real kx21 and kx22 values. It is shown that in a ferrite plate, which is a special case of a bihyrotropic layer, three types of wave distribution over the plate thickness can take place: surface-surface (when kx21 and kx22 are real numbers), volume-surface (kx21 is imaginary and kx22 is real) and volume-volume distribution (kx21 and kx22 are imaginary numbers). Characteristics of the surface spin wave in ferrite plate are investigated. It is found that dependences of the wave numbers kx21 and kx22 on the wave vector orientation are significantly different from the similar magnetostatic dependence for a large part of the wave spectrum.",

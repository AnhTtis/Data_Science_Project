    "abstract": "In this paper, we explore the topic of graph learning from the perspective of the Irregularity-Aware Graph Fourier Transform, with the goal of learning the graph signal space inner product to better model data. We propose a novel method to learn a graph with smaller edge weight upper bounds compared to combinatorial Laplacian approaches. Experimentally, our approach yields much sparser graphs compared to a combinatorial Laplacian approach, with a more interpretable model.",

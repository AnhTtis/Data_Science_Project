    "abstract": "In this paper, we give a direct quantitative estimate of $L^1$norms of non-harmonic trigonometric polynomials over large enough intervals. This extends the result by Konyagin and Mc Gehee, Pigno, Smith  to the settingof trigonometric polynomials with non-integer frequencies.The result is a quantitative extension of a result by Nazarov  and also covers a resultby Hudson and Leckband  when the length of the interval goes to infinity.",

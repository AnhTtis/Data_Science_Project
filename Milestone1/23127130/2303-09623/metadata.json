    "abstract": "WebAssembly has attracted great attention as a portable compilation target for programming languages. To facilitate in-depth studies about this technology, we have deployed Wasmizer, a tool that regularly mines GitHub projects and makes an up-to-date dataset of WebAssembly sources and their binaries publicly available. Presently, we have collected 2 540 C and C++ projects that are highly-related to WebAssembly, and built a dataset of 8 915 binaries that are linked to their source projects. To demonstrate an application of this dataset, we have investigated the presence of eight WebAssembly compilation smells in the wild.",

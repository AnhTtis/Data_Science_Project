    "abstract": "Any-scale image synthesis offers an efficient and scalable solution to synthesize photo-realistic images at any scale, even going beyond 2K resolution. However, existing GAN-based solutions depend excessively on convolutions and a hierarchical architecture, which introduce inconsistency and the $``$texture sticking$\"$ issue when scaling the output resolution. From another perspective, INR-based generators are scale-equivariant by design, but their huge memory footprint and slow inference hinder these networks from being adopted in large-scale or real-time systems. In this work, we propose $\\textbf{C}$olumn-$\\textbf{R}$ow $\\textbf{E}$ntangled $\\textbf{P}$ixel $\\textbf{S}$ynthesis ($\\textbf{CREPS}$), a new generative model that is both efficient and scale-equivariant without using any spatial convolutions or coarse-to-fine design. To save memory footprint and make the system scalable, we employ a novel bi-line representation that decomposes layer-wise feature maps into separate $``$thick$\"$ column and row encodings. Experiments on various datasets, including FFHQ, LSUN-Church, MetFaces, and Flickr-Scenery, confirm CREPS' ability to synthesize scale-consistent and alias-free images at any arbitrary resolution with proper training and inference speed.

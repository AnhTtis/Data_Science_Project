    "abstract": "Gradients in temperature and particle concentration fuel many processes in the physical and biological world. In the present work we study a thermodynamic engine powered by anisotropic thermal excitation (that may be due to e.g., a temperature gradient), and draw parallels with the well-known principle of impedance matching in circuit theory, where for maximal power transfer, the load voltage needs to be half of that of the supplying power source. We maximize power output of the thermodynamic engine at steady-state and show that the optimal reactive force is precise half of that supplied by the anisotropy.",

Attention heatmaps on novel actions which do not have any verb form included in the K400 dictionary. We compare among CLIP (2nd row), ViFi-CLIP (3rd row) and our \OurMethod (4th row). Warm and cold colors indicate high and low attention. \OurMethod has more focused attention on hand and arm for \textit{wave}, and on the area of mouth for \textit{chew}.

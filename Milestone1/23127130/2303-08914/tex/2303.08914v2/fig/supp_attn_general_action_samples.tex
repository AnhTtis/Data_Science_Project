Attention heatmaps on actions which have a verb form (lemma or gerund) directly included in the K400 dictionary. We compare among CLIP (2nd row), ViFi-CLIP (3rd row) and our \OurMethod (4th row). Warm and cold colors indicate high and low attention. \OurMethod has more concentrated attention on the part where the action happens, \eg catching ball with hands (Fig.~\ref{fig:supp_attn_general_action_samples}(a), 4th row), hitting drum with stick (Fig.~\ref{fig:supp_attn_general_action_samples}(b), 4th row), legs and feet jump on stairs (Fig.~\ref{fig:supp_attn_general_action_samples}(c), 4th row), and attention on the running body (Fig.~\ref{fig:supp_attn_general_action_samples}(d), 4th row).

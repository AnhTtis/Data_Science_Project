While previous work relied on full annotation of action datasets which is time-consuming and cost-intensive to collect, our approach \OurMethod finetunes the \vl{} model with unlabeled video data. Specifically, we leverage a set of language sources (action dictionary, VL model and LLM) to construct a text bag for each unlabeled video, and employ the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) objective for finetuning. \OurMethod demonstrates outstanding improvement of zero-shot and few-shot transfer on downstream novel action datasets.

Attention heatmaps on actions which have a verb form (lemma or gerund) directly included in the K400 dictionary. We compare among CLIP (2nd row), ViFi-CLIP (3rd row) and our \OurMethod (4th row). Warm and cold colors indicate high and low attention. \OurMethod has more focused attention on hands (for \textit{clap}) and legs (for \textit{kick ball}).

    "abstract": "We propose a new scenario for the formation of asteroid-mass primordial black holes (PBHs). Our mechanism is based on the annihilation of the string-wall network associated with the breaking of a $U(1)$ global symmetry into a discrete $Z_N$ symmetry. If the potential has multiple local minima ($N>1$) the network is stable, and the annihilation is guaranteed by a bias among the different vacua. The collapse of the string-wall network is accompanied by catastrogenesis, a large production of pseudo-Goldstone bosons (pGBs) -- e.g. axions, ALPs, or majorons -- gravitational waves, and PBHs. If pGBs rapidly decay into products that thermalize, as predicted e.g. in the high-quality QCD axion and heavy majoron models, they do not contribute to the dark matter population, but we show that PBHs can constitute 100% of the dark matter. The gravitational wave background produced by catastrogenesis with heavy unstable axions, ALPs, or majorons could be visible in future interferometers.",

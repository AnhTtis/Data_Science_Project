\section{Conclusion}
We have presented an approach to learning invariance to transformations relevant for time series using deep learning, and demonstrated how it can be used to perform both supervised and unsupervised pixel-based classification of agricultural SITS. We perform our analysis on four recent public datasets with diverse characteristics and covering different countries. Our method significantly improves the performance of NCC and K-means on all datasets, while keeping their interpretability. We show it improves the state of the art on the DENETHOR dataset for classification, and on all datasets for clustering. Additionally, we provide a benchmark of MTSC classification approaches for agricultural SITS classification.

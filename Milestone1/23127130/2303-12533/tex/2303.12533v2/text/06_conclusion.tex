\section{Conclusion}
We have presented an approach to learning invariance to transformations relevant for agricultural time series using deep learning, and demonstrated how it can be used to perform both supervised and unsupervised pixel-based classification of crop SITS. We perform our analysis on four recent public datasets with diverse characteristics and covering different countries. Our method significantly improves the performance of NCC and K-means on all datasets, while keeping their interpretability. We show it improves the state of the art on the DENETHOR dataset for classification. This result emphasizes the need for more multi-year datasets to reliably evaluate the potential of automatic methods for practical crop segmentation scenarios, for which our deformation modeling approach seems to provide significant advantages. \modelname~also achieves best results in a low data regime on PASTIS, and on all datasets for unsupervised clustering. Additionally, we provide a benchmark of MTSC classification approaches for agricultural SITS classification.

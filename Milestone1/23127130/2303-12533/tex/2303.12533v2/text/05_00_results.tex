\section{Results and Discussion}

In this section, we first compare our method to top-performing supervised methods proposed in the literature for MTSC as well as traditional machine learning methods (Sec.~\ref{sec:supclass}). We then demonstrate that our method outperforms the K-means baseline on all four datasets~(Sec.~\ref{sec:unsupclus}) thanks to the design choices for our time series deformations. Finally, we discuss qualitative results and the interpretability of out method (Sec.~\ref{sec:qualitative}).

\subsection{Metrics}

We provide two metrics for evaluating classification accuracy: overall accuracy (OA) and mean accuracy (MA). OA is computed as the ratio of correct and total predictions:
\begin{equation}
    \text{OA} = \frac{\text{TP}+\text{TN}}{\text{TP}+\text{TN}+\text{FP}+\text{FN}},
\end{equation}

where $\text{TP}$, $\text{TN}$, $\text{FP}$ and $\text{FN}$ correspond to true positive, true negative, false positive and false negative, respectively. MA is the class-averaged classification accuracy:
\begin{equation}
    \text{MA} = \frac{1}{K}\sum_{k=1}^K \text{OA}(\{\inputseq_i|y_i=k\}).
\end{equation}

It is important to note that the datasets under consideration show a high degree of imbalance, making MA a more appropriate and informative metric for evaluating classification performance. For this reason, OA scores are shown in gray in Tables~\ref{tab:super}, \ref{tab:unsup} and \ref{tab:super_ablation}.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:con}

With the development of artificial intelligence, new concerns in the field of \WA are emerging. One of them is that the amount of information processed by the tool and by its users becomes increasingly large and overwhelming, especially for people with neurodiversity. Here we propose that this issue can be addressed by using the decades-long experience of the development of IDE and by using them as a model for future research.

    "abstract": "There is interesting internal structure in the nullspaces of graph and hypergraph adjacency matrices, especially for trees, bipartite graphs, and related combinatorial classes. The zero loci of nullvectors, i.e., their zero coordinates' indices, encode information about matchings, coverings, and edges' influence on rank. This set system is the lattice of flats of a ``kernel matroid'', a subsystem of which are the ``stalled'' sets closed under skew zero forcing (SZF), a graph percolation/infection model known to have connections with rank and nullity. For a wide variety of graphs, the lattice of SZF-closed sets is also a matroid, a fact which can be used to obtain a polynomial-time algorithm for computing the skew zero forcing number. This contrasts with the general case, where we show that the corresponding decision problem is NP-hard. We also define skew zero forcing for hypergraphs, and show that, for linear hypertrees, the poset of SZF-closed sets is dual to the lattice of ideals of the hypergraph's nullvariety; while, for complete hypergraphs, the SZF-closed sets and the zero loci of nullvectors are more loosely related.",

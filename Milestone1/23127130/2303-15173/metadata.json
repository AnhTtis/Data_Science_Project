    "abstract": "In this article, we study the mass spectrum of the low-lying triply heavy hybrid baryon, which consists of three valence heavy quarks in a color octet and one valence gluon, with spin-parity $J^P=(\\frac{1}{2})^+$ via QCD sum rules. This is the first study on the triply heavy hybrid baryons in the framework of QCD sum rules. After performing the QCD sum rule analysis, we find that the mass of $cccg$ hybrid baryon lies in $M_{cccg}= 5.91-6.13$ GeV. As a byproduct, the mass of the triply bottom hybrid baryon state is extracted to be around $M_{bbbg}=14.62-14.82$ GeV. The contributions up to dimension eight at the leading order of $α_s$ (LO) in the operator product expansion are taken into account in the calculation. The triply charmed hybrid baryon predicted in this work can decay into one doubly charmed baryon and one charmed meson. Especially, we propose to search for $cccg$ hybrid baryon with $J^{P}= (1/2)^+$ in the P-wave decay channels $Ξ_{cc}^{++} D^0$, $Ξ_{cc}^{+} D^+$, and $Ξ_{ccs}^{+} D_s^+$, which may be accessible in future BelleII, Super-B, PANDA, and LHCb experiments.",

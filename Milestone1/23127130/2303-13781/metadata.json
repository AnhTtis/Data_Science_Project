    "abstract": "Ultra-high energy cosmic rays are the most extreme energetic particles detected on Earth, however, their acceleration sites are still mysterious. We explore the contribution of low-luminosity gamma-ray bursts to the ultra-high energy cosmic ray flux, since they form the bulk of the nearby population. We analyse a representative sample of these bursts detected by BeppoSAX, INTEGRAL and Swift between 1998-2016, and found that in order to reconcile our theoretical flux with the observed flux, these bursts should not accelerate the matter from the progenitor star. Instead, we propose that the jet of low-luminosity gamma-ray bursts propels only the circumburst medium - which is accelerated to relativistic speeds. This has implications for the baryonic load of the jet: it should be negligible compared to the leptonic content.",

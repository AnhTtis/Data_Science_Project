\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we present a novel intermediate representation \emph{virtual marker}, which is more expressive than the prevailing skeleton representation and more accessible than physical markers. Our \vmname\ method, built on virtual markers, excels in detecting these markers in wild images to interpolate and reconstruct complete, realistically shaped meshes. To further address the ambiguity in 3D virtual marker prediction due to occlusions, we progress to \vmproname, a probabilistic approach that generates multiple plausible meshes in alignment with the image. \vmproname\ effectively captures the 3D virtual marker distribution through a conditional diffusion process, enabling precise modeling of 3D mesh distributions. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches and they show advanced generalization potential in spite of its simplicity.

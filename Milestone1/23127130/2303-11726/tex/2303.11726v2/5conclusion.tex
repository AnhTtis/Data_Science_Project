\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we present a novel intermediate representation \emph{Virtual Marker}, which is more expressive than the prevailing skeleton representation and more accessible than physical markers. It can reconstruct 3D meshes more accurately and efficiently, especially in handling diverse body shapes. Besides, the coefficient matrix in the virtual marker representation encodes spatial relationships among mesh vertices which allows the method to implicitly explore structure priors of human body. It achieves better mesh estimation results than the state-of-the-art methods and shows advanced generalization potential in spite of its simplicity.

    "abstract": "Reconstructed jets initiated from heavy quarks provide a powerful tool to probe the properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) and to explore the mass hierarchy of jet quenching. In this article, we review the recent theoretical progresses on heavy-flavour jets in high-energy nuclear collisions at the RHIC and LHC. We focus on the yields and substructures of charm and bottom quark jets with jet quenching effect, such as the nuclear modification factors, transverse momentum imbalance, angular correlation, radial profiles, fragmentation functions, the \"dead-cone\" effect, etc.",

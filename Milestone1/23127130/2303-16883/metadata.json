    "abstract": "Hybrid structures between conventional, s-wave superconductors and two-dimensional topological insulators (2D TIs) are a promising route to topological superconductivity. Here, we investigate planar Josephson junctions fabricated from hybrid structures that use thin films of cadmium arsenide (Cd3As2) as the 2D TI material. Measurements of superconducting interference patterns in a perpendicular magnetic field are used to extract information about the spatial distribution of the supercurrent. We show that the interference patterns are distinctly different in junctions with and without mesa-isolation, respectively. In mesa-defined junctions, the bulk of the 2D TI appears to be almost completely shunted by supercurrent flowing along the edges, while the supercurrent is much more uniform across the junction when the Cd3As2 film extends beyond the device. We discuss the possible origins of the observed behaviors.",

    "abstract": "We address the problem of motion planning for four-way intersection crossings with right-of-ways. Road safety typically assigns liability to the follower in rear-end collisions and to the approaching vehicle required to yield in side crashes. As an alternative to previous models based on heuristic state machines, we propose a planning framework which changes the prediction model of other cars (e.g. their prototypical accelerations and decelerations) depending on the given longitudinal or lateral priority rules. Combined with a state-of-the-art trajectory optimization approach ROPT (Risk Optimization Method) this allows to find ego velocity profiles minimizing risks from curves and all involved vehicles while maximizing utility (needed time to arrive at a goal) and comfort (change and duration of acceleration) under the presence of regulatory conditions. Analytical and statistical evaluations show that our method is able to follow right-of-ways for a wide range of other vehicle behaviors and path geometries. Even when the other cars drive in a non-priority-compliant way, ROPT achieves good risk-comfort tradeoffs.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we first concentrate on the possible values and dense property of entropies for isotropic and anisotropic axial products of subshifts of finite type (SFTs) on $\\mathbb{N}^d$ and $d$-tree $\\mathcal{T}_d$. We prove that the entropies of isotropic and anisotropic axial products of SFTs on $\\mathbb{N}^d$ are dense in $[0,\\infty)$, and the same result also holds for anisotropic axial products of SFTs on $\\mathcal{T}_d$. However, the result is no longer true for isotropic axial products of SFTs on $\\mathcal{T}_d$. Next, motivated by the work of Johnson, Kass and Madden [16], and Schraudner [28], we establish the entropy formula and structures for full axial extension shifts on $\\mathbb{N}^d$ and $\\mathcal{T}_d$. Combining the aforementioned results with the findings on the surface entropy for multiplicative integer systems [8] on $\\mathbb{N}^d$ enables us to estimate the surface entropy for the full axial extension shifts on $\\mathcal{T}_d$. Finally, we extend the results of full axial extension shifts on $\\mathcal{T}_d$ to general trees.",

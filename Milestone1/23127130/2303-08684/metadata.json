    "abstract": "Synchronization is an omnipresent collective phenomenon in nature and technology, whose understanding is in particular for real-world systems still elusive. We study the synchronization transition in a phase oscillator system with two nonvanishing Fourier-modes in the interaction function and hence going beyond the Kuromoto paradigm. We show that the transition scenarios crucially depend on the interplay of the two coupling-modes. We describe the multistability induced by the presence of a second coupling-mode. By extending the collective coordinate approach, we describe the emergence of various states observed in the transition from incoherence to coherence. Remarkably, our analysis suggests that in essence the two-mode coupling gives rise to states that are characterized by two independent but interacting groups of oscillators. We believe that these findings will stimulate future research on dynamical systems including complex interaction functions beyond the Kuramoto-type.",

Phys.{,} 2012{,} 137{,} 154114] is combined with the equation-of-motion coupled-cluster method with singles and doubles (EOM-CCSD) for the treatment of spin–orbit splittings of open-shell molecular systems. Scalar relativistic effects are treated to infinite order from the outset via the spin-free part of the X2C Hamiltonian (sf-X2C){,} whereas the spin–orbit couplings (SOC) are handled at the CC level via the first-order Douglas–Kroll–Hess (DKH) type of spin–orbit operator (so-DKH1). Since the exponential of single excitations{,} i.e.{,} exp(T1){,} introduces sufficient spin orbital relaxations{,} the inclusion of SOC at the CC level is essentially the same in accuracy as the inclusion of SOC from the outset in terms of the two-component spinors determined variationally by the sf-X2C+so-DKH1 Hamiltonian{,} but is computationally more efficient. Therefore{,} such an approach (denoted as sf-X2C-EOM-CCSD(SOC)) can achieve uniform accuracy for the spin–orbit splittings of both light and heavy elements. For light elements{,} the treatment of SOC can even be postponed until the EOM step (denoted as sf-X2C-EOM(SOC)-CCSD){,} so as to further reduce the computational cost. To reveal the efficacy of sf-X2C-EOM-CCSD(SOC) and sf-X2C-EOM(SOC)-CCSD{,} the spin–orbit splittings of the 2Π states of monohydrides up to the sixth row of the periodic table are investigated. The results show that sf-X2C-EOM-CCSD(SOC) predicts very accurate results (within 5 percent) for elements up to the fifth row{,} whereas sf-X2C-EOM(SOC)-CCSD is useful only for light elements (up to the third row but with some exceptions). For comparison{,} the sf-X2C-S-TD-DFT-SOC approach [spin-adapted open-shell time-dependent density functional theory{,} Mol. Phys.{,} 2013{,} 111{,} 3741] is applied to the same systems. The overall accuracy (1–10 percent) is satisfactory."}

    abstract = {In this work, a relativistic version of the state-averaged complete active space self-consistent field method is developed (spin-orbit coupled state-averaged complete active space self-consistent field; CAS-SOC). The program follows a "one-step strategy" and treats the spin-orbit interaction (SOC) on the same footing as the electron-electron interaction. As opposed to other existing approaches, the program employs an intermediate coupling scheme in which spin and space symmetry adapted configuration space functions are allowed to interact via SOC. This adds to the transparency and computational efficiency of the procedure. The approach requires the utilization of complex-valued configuration interaction coefficients, but the molecular orbital coefficients can be kept real-valued without loss of generality. Hence, expensive arithmetic associated with evaluation of complex-valued transformed molecular integrals is completely avoided. In order to investigate the quality of the calculated wave function, we extended the method to the calculation of electronic g-tensors. As the SOC is already treated to all orders in the SA-CASSCF process, first order perturbation theory with the Zeeman operator is sufficient to accomplish this task. As a test-set, we calculated g-tensors of a set of diatomics, a set of d(1) transition metal complexes MOX4(n-), and a set of 5f(1) actinide complexes AnX6(n-). These calculations reveal that the effect of the wavefunction relaxation due to variation inclusion of SOC is of the same order of magnitude as the effect of inclusion of dynamic correlation and hence cannot be neglected for the accurate prediction of electronic g-tensors.},

E. Bates and T. Shiozaki, J. Chem. Phys. 142, 044112 (2015)]. Our algorithm is based on the second-order orbital update scheme with an iterative augmented Hessian procedure, in which the density-fitted orbital Hessian is directly contracted to the trial vectors. Using this scheme, each microiteration is made less time consuming than one Dirac–Hartree–Fock iteration, and macroiterations converge quadratically. In addition, we show that the CASSCF calculations with the Gaunt and full Breit interactions can be efficiently performed by means of approximate orbital Hessians computed with the Dirac–Coulomb Hamiltonian. It is demonstrated that our algorithm can also be applied to systems under an external magnetic field, for which all of the molecular integrals are computed using...},

The program is based upon Kramers-paired spinors and a full implementation of the binary double groups (D(2h)(*) and subgroups). The underlying quaternion algebra for one-electron operators was extended to treat two-electron integrals and density matrices in an efficient and nonredundant way. The iterative procedure is direct with respect to both configurational and spinor variational parameters; this permits the use of large configuration expansions and many basis functions. The relativistic minimum-maximum principle is implemented in a second-order restricted-step optimization algorithm, which provides sharp and well-controlled convergence. This paper focuses on the necessary modifications of nonrelativistic MCSCF methodology to obtain a fully variational KR-MCSCF implementation. The general implementation also allows for the use of molecular integrals from a two-component relativistic Hamiltonian as, for example, the Douglas-Kroll-Hess variants. Several sample applications concern the determination of spectroscopic properties of heavy-element atoms and molecules, demonstrating the influence of spin-orbit coupling in MCSCF approaches to such systems and showing the potential of the new method.},

    abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 American Chemical Society. Within current electronic structure theory methods, fully relativistic four-component (4c) approaches based on the Dirac Hamiltonian treat spin-orbit coupling with the most rigor. The spin treatment arises naturally from the formulation and does not need to be included ad hoc. Spin-orbit splittings can provide insightful benchmark criteria for the assessment of 4c methods; however, there have not been extensive studies in this respect. Spin-orbit splittings of the p-block elements B-I were computed using the 4c-CASSCF, 4c-CASPT2, and 4c-MR-CISD+Q methods, as recently implemented in BAGEL, with uncontracted Dunning basis sets. Comparison with experiment reveals that the four-component methods yield good results, with most of the computed splittings falling within 15{\%} of the experimental values. A large basis set is needed to obtain accurate splittings of the light elements B-F, while splittings of heavier elements show little basis dependence. The 4c-MR-CISD+Q method gave the best splittings for light elements, while 4c-CASSCF showed the best splittings for elements beyond fluorine. The 4c-CASPT2 method gave the best splittings for group 13 atoms.},

    abstract = {An extensive introduction to spin–orbit coupling (SOC) is presented, starting from a discussion of the phenomenological operators and general chemical importance of SOC to studies of chemical reactions. Quantitative SOC operators are discussed, and the symmetry properties of the SOC Hamiltonian important for understanding the general features of SOC are summarized. Comparison of the one- and two-electron contributions to SOC is given, followed bya discussion of commonlyused approximations for the two-electron part. Applications of SOC to studies using effective and model core potentials have been analysed. The theoretical discussion is illustrated with numerous practical examples, including diatomic molecules (with an emphasis on hydrides) and some examples for polyatomic molecules. The fine structure of the SOC interaction (vibrational dependence) for some diatomic molecules has been elucidated.},

    abstract = { The recently proposed spin-adapted time-dependent density functional theory (S-TD-DFT) is extended to the relativistic domain for fine-structure splittings of excited states of open-shell systems. Scalar-relativistic effects are treated to infinite order via the spin-free (sf) part of the exact two-component (X2C) Hamiltonian, whereas the spin–orbit couplings (SOC) between the scalar-excited states are treated perturbatively via an effective one-electron spin–orbit operator derived from the same X2C Hamiltonian. The calculated results for prototypical open-shell systems containing heavy elements reveal that the composite approach sf-X2C-S-TD-DFT-SOC is very promising. The fine-structure splitting of a spatially degenerate ground state can also be described properly by taking a non-degenerate excited state as the reference. }

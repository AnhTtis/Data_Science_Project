	abstract = {The purpose of this work is to make the coupled cluster (CC) energy stationary with respect to molecular-orbital (MO) variations in the reference configuration. To achieve this, we have used the Z vector, the solution of a set of perturbation-independent CPHF-like equations, to rotate the MOs. A new energy and gradient calculation is carried out with these non-SCF orbitals to obtain a new Z vector. The process is repeated until the orbitals are optimized (Z = 0), i.e. the contribution to the analytic CC gradient coming from orbital relaxation (CPHF) is zero. At the CCD level the orbitals thus obtained are approximate Brueckner orbitals. At the CCSD level, convergence problems were found in the iterative procedure to optimize the orbitals. Results obtained for several molecules show that CCD wavefunctions constructed from these optimized orbitals are of CCSD quality. We conclude that the presence of exp(t1) in the CCSD model accounts for most relaxation effects and there is not much to gain by orbital optimization in CCSD wavefunctions.}

To fully exploit its potential, one needs to build a toolbox of polaritonic phenomenologies that supplement those of standard photochemistry. By means of a state-of-the-art computational photochemistry approach extended to the strong-coupling regime, here we disclose various mechanisms peculiar of polaritonic chemistry: coherent population oscillations between polaritons, quenching by trapping in dead-end polaritonic states and the alteration of the photochemical reaction pathway and quantum yields. We focus on azobenzene photoisomerization, that encompasses the essential features of complex photochemical reactions such as the presence of conical intersections and reaction coordinates involving multiple internal modes. In the strong coupling regime, a polaritonic conical intersection arises and we characterize its role in the photochemical process. Our chemically detailed simulations provide a framework to rationalize how the strong coupling impacts the photochemistry of realistic molecules.},

In their design, these switching units were placed in close proximity, but electronically separated by a sp3 center. The azobenzene switches were prepared by Baeyer–Mills coupling as key step. The isomerization behavior was investigated by 1H NMR spectroscopy, UV/Vis spectroscopy, and HPLC. It was shown that all azobenzene moieties are efficiently switchable. Despite the geometric decoupling of the chromophores, computational studies revealed excitonic coupling effects between the individual azobenzene units depending on the connectivity pattern due to the different transition dipole moments of the π→π* excitations. Transition probabilities for those excitations are slightly altered, which is also revealed in their absorption spectra. These insights provide new design parameters for combining multiple photoswitches in one molecule, which have high potential as energy or information storage systems, or, among others, in molecular machines and supramolecular chemistry.},

When the flow is slow enough, the quantum gas enters a superfluid regime, and neither whirlpools nor waves form around the obstacle. For higher flow velocities, it has been predicted that the perturbation induced by the defect gives rise to the turbulent emission of quantized vortices and to the nucleation of solitons. Using an interacting Bose gas of exciton-polaritons in a semiconductor microcavity, we report the transition from superfluidity to the hydrodynamic formation of oblique dark solitons and vortex streets in the wake of a potential barrier. The direct observation of these topological excitations provides key information on the mechanisms of superflow and shows the potential of polariton condensates for quantum turbulence studies.}}

	abstract = { We propose a robust and efficient way of controlling the optical spectra of two-dimensional materials and van der Waals heterostructures by quantum cavity embedding. The cavity light-matter coupling leads to the formation of exciton–polaritons, a superposition of photons and excitons. Our first-principles study demonstrates a reordering and mixing of bright and dark excitons spectral features and in the case of a type II van-der-Waals heterostructure an inversion of intra- and interlayer excitonic resonances. We further show that the cavity light-matter coupling strongly depends on the dielectric environment and can be controlled by encapsulating the active two-dimensional (2D) crystal in another dielectric material. Our theoretical calculations are based on a newly developed nonperturbative many-body framework to solve the coupled electron–photon Schrödinger equation in a quantum-electrodynamical extension of the Bethe-Salpeter approach. This approach enables the ab initio simulations of exciton–polariton states and their dispersion from weak to strong cavity light-matter coupling regimes. Our method is then extended to treat van der Waals heterostructures and encapsulated 2D materials using a simplified Mott-Wannier description of the excitons that can be applied to very large systems beyond reach for fully ab initio approaches. }

So far, laser control of solids has been mainly discussed in the context of strong classical nonlinear light-matter coupling in a pump-probe framework. Here, we propose a quantum-electrodynamical setting to address the coupling of a low-dimensional quantum material to quantized electromagnetic fields in quantum cavities. Using a prototypical model system describing FeSe/SrTiO3 with electron-phonon long-range forward scattering, we study how the formation of phonon polaritons at the two-dimensional interface of the material modifies effective couplings and superconducting properties in a Migdal-Eliashberg simulation. We find that through highly polarizable dipolar phonons, large cavity-enhanced electron-phonon couplings are possible, but superconductivity is not enhanced for the forward-scattering pairing mechanism due to the interplay between coupling enhancement and mode softening. Our results demonstrate that quantum cavities enable the engineering of fundamental couplings in solids, paving the way for unprecedented control of material properties. }

In recent years, cavity experiments have also been conducted on a variety of solid-state systems resulting in many interesting applications, of which microlasers, photon bandgap structures and quantum dot structures in cavities are outstanding examples. Although these phenomena and systems are very interesting, discussion is limited here to free atoms and mostly single atoms because these systems exhibit clean quantum phenomena and are not disturbed by a variety of other effects. At the centre of our review is the work on the one-atom maser, but we also give a survey of the entire field, using free atoms in order to show the large variety of problems dealt with. The cavity interaction can be separated into two main regimes: the weak coupling in cavity or cavity-like structures with low quality factors Q and the strong coupling when high-Q cavities are involved. The weak coupling leads to modification of spontaneous transitions and level shifts, whereas the strong coupling enables one to observe a periodic exchange of photons between atoms and the radiation field. In this case, atoms and photons are entangled, this being the basis for a variety of phenomena observed, some of them leading to interesting applications in quantum information processing. The cavity experiments with free atoms reached a new domain with the advent of experiments in the visible spectral region. A review on recent achievements in this area is also given.}

In a semiconductor microcavity, the confined electromagnetic field modifies the optical transitions of the material. Two distinct types of interaction are possible: weak and strong coupling1,2,3,4. In the former perturbative regime, the spectral and spatial distribution of the emission is modified but exciton dynamics are little altered. In the latter case, however, mixing of exciton and photon states occurs leading to strongly modified dynamics.

In fact, the relation of vibrational excitation to reactivity has generally proven subtler and more complex. Thomas et al. studied how strong coupling of specific vibrational modes to an optical cavity might influence a molecule with two competing reactive sites. The molecule had two silicon centers that could react with fluoride by respective cleavage of a Si–C or Si–O bond. Exciting the vibrations at either center slowed down the overall reaction while favoring otherwise disfavored Si–O cleavage. Science, this issue p. 615 Strong coupling of vibrational modes to an optical cavity shifts site-selectivity in competing silyl substitution reactions. Many chemical methods have been developed to favor a particular product in transformations of compounds that have two or more reactive sites. We explored a different approach to site selectivity using vibrational strong coupling (VSC) between a reactant and the vacuum field of a microfluidic optical cavity. Specifically, we studied the reactivity of a compound bearing two possible silyl bond cleavage sites—Si–C and Si–O, respectively—as a function of VSC of three distinct vibrational modes in the dark. The results show that VSC can indeed tilt the reactivity landscape to favor one product over the other. Thermodynamic parameters reveal the presence of a large activation barrier and substantial changes to the activation entropy, confirming the modified chemical landscape under strong coupling. }

	abstract = { Psi4 is an ab initio electronic structure program providing methods such as Hartree–Fock, density functional theory, configuration interaction, and coupled-cluster theory. The 1.1 release represents a major update meant to automate complex tasks, such as geometry optimization using complete-basis-set extrapolation or focal-point methods. Conversion of the top-level code to a Python module means that Psi4 can now be used in complex workflows alongside other Python tools. Several new features have been added with the aid of libraries providing easy access to techniques such as density fitting, Cholesky decomposition, and Laplace denominators. The build system has been completely rewritten to simplify interoperability with independent, reusable software components for quantum chemistry. Finally, a wide range of new theoretical methods and analyses have been added to the code base, including functional-group and open-shell symmetry adapted perturbation theory, density-fitted coupled cluster with frozen natural orbitals, orbital-optimized perturbation and coupled-cluster methods (e.g., OO-MP2 and OO-LCCD), density-fitted multiconfigurational self-consistent field, density cumulant functional theory, algebraic-diagrammatic construction excited states, improvements to the geometry optimizer, and the “X2C” approach to relativistic corrections, among many other improvements. }

Mutual polarization effects are easily incorporated within a standard ground-state Hartree-Fock computation, and time-dependent simulations carry the same formal computational scaling as real-time time-dependent Hartree-Fock theory.

	abstract = {{In condensed matter physics, material science and quantum chemistry, recent experimental progress has laid the foundation to control and alter the properties of matter at will by coupling strongly to individual photons or even just the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. This is usually realized by changing the photonic environment and with this the photon field, e.g., by using high-Q optical cavities or plasmonic nanostructures to which the matter system is then strongly coupled to. The ensuing strong coupling brings about novel states of matter with hybrid light-matter character known as polaritons. These hybridized systems allow to control material properties and chemistry in an unprecedented way such as altering chemical reactions, room-temperature polariton lasing, enhance charge and energy transfer, to name but a few. To better understand these intriguing effects, numerous theoretical studies have been performed, most of which are based on simple approximate models. These simplified models capture correctly the main features of the emerging novel physics but overlook important details pertaining to the coupled system. To overcome these restrictions, ab-initio methods such as quantum electrodynamical density-functional theory ( QEDFT ) that treat matter and photons on the same quantized footing have recently been developed. This method allow an in-depth modeling of the light-matter system from first principles. However, the application of these theoretical methods is so far still limited. This is, on the one hand, due to missing efficient numerical schemes to solve the resulting equations. On the other hand, it remains unclear in which cases a full ab-initio simulation would provide novel insights and uncovers new effects. This work presents a first-principles linear-response formulation of QEDFT that captures the hallmark of strong light-matter coupling (Rabi splitting between polaritons) usually identified in linear spectroscopy. Crucial in the linear-response formulation is the stability of matter. While in the usual models this issue is irrelevant, we show how answering this question can shed light on the long-lasting debate about the existence of a Dicke superradiant phase. We extend three linear-response methods for matter-only systems to the linear-response framework of QEDFT that makes the problem computationally feasible. These methods are shown to be numerically equivalent and capture excited-states properties of strongly coupled light-matter systems which is identified by the emergence of polaritonic peaks not only in the matter spectrum but also the photonic spectrum. These strong coupling features are not captured by standard many-body methods that discard the photon degrees of freedom. This opens new possibilities to investigate different situations with complex systems coupled to many photon modes such as non-perturbative first-principles calculation of lifetimes of excited-states, beyond the single molecule limit and dissipation, and Lorentz to Fano transition of lineshapes in strong coupling. Making QEDFT practical now provides a route to analyze and propose experiments at the interface between quantum chemistry, nanoplasmonics and quantum optics and present novel observables that describes the strong coupling between light and matter. Beyond the linear response, this work also highlights new avenues of the down-conversion process that become available in ab-initio simulations of coupled light-matter systems. By changing the photonic environment in an experimentally feasible way, we can engineer hybrid light-matter states that enhance at the same time the efficiency of the down-conversion process and the non-classicality of the generated photons. In addition, we show that this also causes the down-conversion to occur at earlier times with potential to overcome detrimental decoherence effects. By coupling the signal modes to virtual and polaritonic states we propose an inverse (high-) harmonic generation that acts as an N-photon gun (source). Such a cavity-controlled down-conversion process will not be captured using standard non-linear optics approach since the field is treated classically and only as an external perturbation and with a quantum optics approach, it becomes less accurate due to the simplification of the matter subsystem to a few "relevant" energy levels.}},

	abstract = { We derive the full linear-response theory for nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics in the long wavelength limit and provide a practical framework to solve the resulting equations by using quantum-electrodynamical density-functional theory. We highlight how the coupling between quantized light and matter changes the usual response functions and introduces cross-correlated light-matter response functions. These cross-correlation responses lead to measurable changes in Maxwell’s equations due to the quantum-matter-mediated photon–photon interactions. Key features of treating the combined matter-photon response are that natural lifetimes of excitations become directly accessible from first-principles, changes in the electronic structure due to strong light-matter coupling are treated fully nonperturbatively, and self-consistent solutions of the back-reaction of matter onto the photon vacuum and vice versa are accounted for. By introducing a straightforward extension of the random-phase approximation for the coupled matter-photon problem, we calculate the ab initio spectra for a real molecular system that is coupled to the quantized electromagnetic field. Our approach can be solved numerically very efficiently. The presented framework leads to a shift in paradigm by highlighting how electronically excited states arise as a modification of the photon field and that experimentally observed effects are always due to a complex interplay between light and matter. At the same time the findings provide a route to analyze as well as propose experiments at the interface between quantum chemistry, nanoplasmonics and quantum optics. }

Here, we introduce the quantum electrodynamics unitary coupled cluster (QED-UCC) method combined with the Variational Quantum Eigensolver algorithm, as well as the quantum electrodynamics equation-of-motion (QED-EOM) method formulated in the qubit basis that allow accurate calculations of ground-state and excited-state properties of strongly coupled light-matter systems suitable for quantum computers. These methods show excellent agreement with the exact reference results and can outperform their traditional counterparts when strong electronic correlations become significant. This work sets the stage for future developments of polaritonic quantum chemistry methods suitable for both classical and quantum computers. }

Plasmon–exciton coupling models reveal different coupling strengths depending on the molecular organization and the protein coverage, consistent with strong coupling. Strong coupling was also observed for self-assembling polypeptide maquettes that contain only chlorins.

	journal = JPBAMP,
	abstract = {Most theoretical studies for correlated light–matter systems are performed within the long-wavelength limit, i.e., the electromagnetic field is assumed to be spatially uniform. In this limit the so-called length-gauge transformation for a fully quantized light–matter system gives rise to a dipole self-energy term in the Hamiltonian, i.e., a harmonic potential of the total dipole matter moment. In practice this term is often discarded as it is assumed to be subsumed in the kinetic energy term. In this work we show the necessity of the dipole self-energy term. First and foremost, without it the light–matter system in the long-wavelength limit does not have a ground-state, i.e., the combined light–matter system is unstable. Further, the mixing of matter and photon degrees of freedom due to the length-gauge transformation, which also changes the representation of the translation operator for matter, gives rise to the Maxwell equations in matter and the omittance of the dipole self-energy leads to a violation of these equations. Specifically we show that without the dipole self-energy the so-called ‘depolarization shift’ is not properly described. Finally we show that this term also arises if we perform the semi-classical limit after the length-gauge transformation. In contrast to the standard approach where the semi-classical limit is performed before the length-gauge transformation, the resulting Hamiltonian is bounded from below and thus supports ground-states. This is very important for practical calculations and for density-functional variational implementations of the non-relativistic QED formalism. For example, the existence of a combined light–matter ground-state allows one to calculate the Stark shift non-perturbatively.}

	abstract = { Quantum electrodynamics (QED) is the physical theory that describes the interaction of electrons and photons at a fundamental level. Its characteristic feature is that the radiation field, as well as the system of material particles, obeys the postulates of quantum mechanics. A rigorous non-relativistic formulation of this theory applicable to atoms and molecules has also been developed and applied with outstanding success to a number of processes of interest to chemical physicists, being most commonly explicated for a system of charged particles coupled to the electromagnetic field, with the latter second quantized. Calculations are subsequently carried out in the Schrödinger picture. In the last twenty-five years or so, considerable work on Coulomb gauge QED of molecules has been performed in the Heisenberg representation of quantum mechanics by adopting a completely field theoretic point of view. The methods and results of this approach, which offer significant advantages over conventional perturbative techniques for the solution of a number of problems, are reviewed. Beginning with the second quantized multipolar Hamiltonian, the Heisenberg equations of motion for the fermion and boson creation and annihilation operators are obtained. In the electric dipole approximation these are used to evaluate the Maxwell field operators in the proximity of a source in series of powers of the transition moment on iteration. Comparison is then made with the analogous fields computed in the minimal-coupling scheme. Formulae are also given for the fields of a moving source of charge. Two observables of the electromagnetic field associated with a stationary distribution of charge, namely the Poynting vector and the energy density, are then calculated. The source fields are then used in a response theory formalism to calculate the resonant transfer of energy between an excited and an unexcited pair of molecules, and the retarded van der Waals dispersion energy shift between two excited electric dipole polarizable molecules, from which the results when one or both of the pair is in the ground electronic state, are easily derivable. Extension of response theory to many-body dispersion forces is then outlined, with explicit results being given for the retarded correction to the Axilrod–Teller–Muto three-body interaction energy. }

Es zeigt sich, dass dann zwar die Unendlichkeit stets beseitigt wird und dass die in der gew{\"o}hnlichen Theorie als strahlungslos betrachteten Ablenkungen hier als solche mit endlichem, wenn auch sehr kleinem Energieverlust erscheinen. Andrerseits h{\"a}ngt aber nach der genauen Theorie der n{\"a}here Verlauf von dq f{\"u}r sehr kleine Energieverluste E so wesentlich von der Ausdehnung des geladenen K{\"o}rpers ab, dass eine unmittelbare Anwendung des Resultates auf wirkliche Elektronen wicht m{\"o}glich ist.

	abstract = {Summary This chapter introduces field quantization using the Canonical quantization approach. Canonical quantization itself is introduced, as well as cavities and the independent degrees of the radiation field. As an example of quantum effect the Casimir effect is discussed. Two approaches are used: Casimir's original approach and a more physical calculation using the Maxwell stress tensor. The latter introduces the scattering approach method for calculating cavity modes. The chapter closes with a discussion of the Cosmological Constant problem (vacuum catastrophe) under the light of the discovery in 1998 that the universe's expansion is actually accelerating.}

	title={Comparison of quantum and semiclassical radiation theories with application to the beam maser},

	year={1963},

	volume={51},

	number={1},

	pages={89-109},

	abstract={This paper has two purposes: 1) to clarify the relationship between the quantum theory of radiation, where the electromagnetic field-expansion coefficients satisfy commutation relations, and the semiclassical theory, where the electromagnetic field is considered as a definite function of time rather than as an operator; and 2) to apply some of the results in a study of amplitude and frequency stability in a molecular beam maser. In 1), it is shown that the semiclassical theory, when extended te take into account both the effect of the field on the molecules and the effect of the molecules on the field, reproduces almost quantitatively the same laws of energy exchange and coherence properties as the quantized field theory, even in the limit of one or a few quanta in the field mode. In particular, the semiclassical theory is shown to lead to a prediction of spontaneous emission, with the same decay rate as given by quantum electrodynamics, described by the Einstein A coefficients. In 2), the semiclassical theory is applied to the molecular beam maser. Equilibrium amplitude and frequency of oscillation are obtained for an arbitrary velocity distribution of focused molecules, generalizing the results obtained previously by Gordon, Zeiger, and Townes for a singel-velocity beam, and by Lamb and Helmer for a Maxwellian beam. A somewhat surprising result is obtained; which is that the measurable properties of the maser, such as starting current, effective molecular Q, etc., depend mostly on the slowest 5 to 10 per cent of the molecules. Next we calculate the effect of amplitude and frequency of oscillation, of small systematic perturbations. We obtain a prediction that stability can be improved by adjusting the system so that the molecules emit all their energy h Ω to the field, then reabsorb part of it, before leaving the cavity. In general, the most stable operation is obtained when the molecules are in the process of absorbing energy from the radiation as they leave the cavity, most unstable when they are still emitting energy at that time. Finally, we consider the response of an oscillating maser to randomly time-varying perturbations. Graphs are given showing predicted response to a small superimposed signal of a frequency near the oscillation frequency. The existence of "noise enhancing" and "noise quieting" modes of operation found here is a general property of any oscillating system in which amplitude is limited by nonlinearity.},

	abstract = { A large-scale implementation of the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) method is presented. The active space is described using the variational two-electron reduced-density-matrix (v2RDM) approach, and the algorithm is applicable to much larger active spaces than can be treated using configuration-interaction-driven methods. Density fitting or Cholesky decomposition approximations to the electron repulsion integral tensor allow for the simultaneous optimization of large numbers of external orbitals. We have tested the implementation by evaluating singlet–triplet energy gaps in the linear polyacene series and two dinitrene biradical compounds. For the acene series, we report computations that involve active spaces consisting of as many as 50 electrons in 50 orbitals and the simultaneous optimization of 1892 orbitals. For the dinitrene compounds, we find that the singlet–triplet gaps obtained from v2RDM-driven CASSCF with partial three-electron N-representability conditions agree with those obtained from configuration-interaction-driven approaches to within one-third of 1 kcal mol–1. When enforcing only the two-electron N-representability conditions, v2RDM-driven CASSCF yields less accurate singlet–triplet energy gaps in these systems, but the quality of the results is still far superior to those obtained from standard single-reference approaches. }

	abstract = { Analytic energy gradients are presented for a variational two-electron reduced-density-matrix (2-RDM)-driven complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) method. The active-space 2-RDM is determined using a semidefinite programing (SDP) algorithm built upon an augmented Lagrangian formalism. Expressions for analytic gradients are simplified by the fact that the Lagrangian is stationary with respect to variations in both the primal and the dual solutions to the SDP problem. Orbital response contributions to the gradient are identical to those that arise in conventional CASSCF methods in which the electronic structure of the active space is described by a full configuration interaction (CI) wave function. We explore the relative performance of variational 2-RDM (v2RDM)- and CI-driven CASSCF for the equilibrium geometries of 20 small molecules. When enforcing two-particle N-representability conditions, full-valence v2RDM-CASSCF-optimized bond lengths display a mean unsigned error of 0.0060 Å and a maximum unsigned error of 0.0265 Å, relative to those obtained from full-valence CI-CASSCF. When enforcing partial three-particle N-representability conditions, the mean and maximum unsigned errors are reduced to only 0.0006 and 0.0054 Å, respectively. For these same molecules, full-valence v2RDM-CASSCF bond lengths computed in the cc-pVQZ basis set deviate from experimentally determined ones on average by 0.017 and 0.011 Å when enforcing two- and three-particle conditions, respectively, whereas CI-CASSCF displays an average deviation of 0.010 Å. The v2RDM-CASSCF approach with two-particle conditions is also applied to the equilibrium geometry of pentacene; optimized bond lengths deviate from those derived from experiment, on average, by 0.015 Å when using a cc-pVDZ basis set and a (22e,22o) active space. }

The approach is based on the analysis of a single metric parameter within a free (noncoordinated) ligand: the interatomic separation between the N-donor metal-binding sites. An extensive analysis of existing complexes allows the determination of critical N···N distances that dictate the regions of stability for the high-spin and low-spin complexes, as well as the intermediate range in which the magnetic bistability (spin crossover) can be observed. The prediction has been tested on several complexes that demonstrate the validity of our method. }

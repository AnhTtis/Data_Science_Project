    abstract = {Molecules sandwiched in an optical cavity can form hybrid light-matter states at energies below the dark spin triplet state. In organic microcavities, hybrid light-matter states can form with energies that differ from the bare molecular excitation energies by nearly 1 eV. A timely question, given the recent advances in the development of thermally activated delayed fluorescence materials, is whether strong light-matter coupling can be used to invert the ordering of singlet and triplet states and, in addition, enhance reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) rates. Here, we demonstrate a complete inversion of the singlet lower polariton and triplet excited states. We also unambiguously measure the RISC rate in strongly coupled organic microcavities and find that, regardless of the large energy level shifts, it is unchanged compared to films of the bare molecules. This observation is a consequence of slow RISC to the lower polariton due to the delocalized nature of the state across many molecules and an inability to compete with RISC to the dark exciton reservoir.}}

    abstract={Strong coupling between light and matter leads to the spontaneous formation of hybrid light--matter states, having different energies than the uncoupled states. This opens up for new ways of modifying the energy landscape of molecules without changing their atoms or structure. Heavy metal-free organic light emitting diodes (OLED) use reversed intersystem crossing (RISC) to harvest light from excited triplet states. This is a slow process, thus increasing the rate of RISC could potentially enhance OLED performance. Here we demonstrate selective coupling of the excited singlet state of Erythrosine B without perturbing the energy level of a nearby triplet state. The coupling reduces the triplet--singlet energy gap, leading to a four-time enhancement of the triplet decay rate, most likely due to an enhanced rate of RISC. Furthermore, we anticipate that strong coupling can be used to create energy-inverted molecular systems having a singlet ground and lowest excited state.},

Phys.{,} 2012{,} 137{,} 154114] is combined with the equation-of-motion coupled-cluster method with singles and doubles (EOM-CCSD) for the treatment of spin–orbit splittings of open-shell molecular systems. Scalar relativistic effects are treated to infinite order from the outset via the spin-free part of the X2C Hamiltonian (sf-X2C){,} whereas the spin–orbit couplings (SOC) are handled at the CC level via the first-order Douglas–Kroll–Hess (DKH) type of spin–orbit operator (so-DKH1). Since the exponential of single excitations{,} i.e.{,} exp(T1){,} introduces sufficient spin orbital relaxations{,} the inclusion of SOC at the CC level is essentially the same in accuracy as the inclusion of SOC from the outset in terms of the two-component spinors determined variationally by the sf-X2C+so-DKH1 Hamiltonian{,} but is computationally more efficient. Therefore{,} such an approach (denoted as sf-X2C-EOM-CCSD(SOC)) can achieve uniform accuracy for the spin–orbit splittings of both light and heavy elements. For light elements{,} the treatment of SOC can even be postponed until the EOM step (denoted as sf-X2C-EOM(SOC)-CCSD){,} so as to further reduce the computational cost. To reveal the efficacy of sf-X2C-EOM-CCSD(SOC) and sf-X2C-EOM(SOC)-CCSD{,} the spin–orbit splittings of the 2Π states of monohydrides up to the sixth row of the periodic table are investigated. The results show that sf-X2C-EOM-CCSD(SOC) predicts very accurate results (within 5 percent) for elements up to the fifth row{,} whereas sf-X2C-EOM(SOC)-CCSD is useful only for light elements (up to the third row but with some exceptions). For comparison{,} the sf-X2C-S-TD-DFT-SOC approach [spin-adapted open-shell time-dependent density functional theory{,} Mol. Phys.{,} 2013{,} 111{,} 3741] is applied to the same systems. The overall accuracy (1–10 percent) is satisfactory."}

    abstract = {In this work, a relativistic version of the state-averaged complete active space self-consistent field method is developed (spin-orbit coupled state-averaged complete active space self-consistent field; CAS-SOC). The program follows a "one-step strategy" and treats the spin-orbit interaction (SOC) on the same footing as the electron-electron interaction. As opposed to other existing approaches, the program employs an intermediate coupling scheme in which spin and space symmetry adapted configuration space functions are allowed to interact via SOC. This adds to the transparency and computational efficiency of the procedure. The approach requires the utilization of complex-valued configuration interaction coefficients, but the molecular orbital coefficients can be kept real-valued without loss of generality. Hence, expensive arithmetic associated with evaluation of complex-valued transformed molecular integrals is completely avoided. In order to investigate the quality of the calculated wave function, we extended the method to the calculation of electronic g-tensors. As the SOC is already treated to all orders in the SA-CASSCF process, first order perturbation theory with the Zeeman operator is sufficient to accomplish this task. As a test-set, we calculated g-tensors of a set of diatomics, a set of d(1) transition metal complexes MOX4(n-), and a set of 5f(1) actinide complexes AnX6(n-). These calculations reveal that the effect of the wavefunction relaxation due to variation inclusion of SOC is of the same order of magnitude as the effect of inclusion of dynamic correlation and hence cannot be neglected for the accurate prediction of electronic g-tensors.},

E. Bates and T. Shiozaki, J. Chem. Phys. 142, 044112 (2015)]. Our algorithm is based on the second-order orbital update scheme with an iterative augmented Hessian procedure, in which the density-fitted orbital Hessian is directly contracted to the trial vectors. Using this scheme, each microiteration is made less time consuming than one Dirac–Hartree–Fock iteration, and macroiterations converge quadratically. In addition, we show that the CASSCF calculations with the Gaunt and full Breit interactions can be efficiently performed by means of approximate orbital Hessians computed with the Dirac–Coulomb Hamiltonian. It is demonstrated that our algorithm can also be applied to systems under an external magnetic field, for which all of the molecular integrals are computed using...},

    abstract = {A new direct relativistic four-component Kramers-restricted multiconfiguration self-consistent-field (KR-MCSCF) code for molecules has been implemented. The program is based upon Kramers-paired spinors and a full implementation of the binary double groups (D(2h)(*) and subgroups). The underlying quaternion algebra for one-electron operators was extended to treat two-electron integrals and density matrices in an efficient and nonredundant way. The iterative procedure is direct with respect to both configurational and spinor variational parameters; this permits the use of large configuration expansions and many basis functions. The relativistic minimum-maximum principle is implemented in a second-order restricted-step optimization algorithm, which provides sharp and well-controlled convergence. This paper focuses on the necessary modifications of nonrelativistic MCSCF methodology to obtain a fully variational KR-MCSCF implementation. The general implementation also allows for the use of molecular integrals from a two-component relativistic Hamiltonian as, for example, the Douglas-Kroll-Hess variants. Several sample applications concern the determination of spectroscopic properties of heavy-element atoms and molecules, demonstrating the influence of spin-orbit coupling in MCSCF approaches to such systems and showing the potential of the new method.},

    abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 American Chemical Society. Within current electronic structure theory methods, fully relativistic four-component (4c) approaches based on the Dirac Hamiltonian treat spin-orbit coupling with the most rigor. The spin treatment arises naturally from the formulation and does not need to be included ad hoc. Spin-orbit splittings can provide insightful benchmark criteria for the assessment of 4c methods; however, there have not been extensive studies in this respect. Spin-orbit splittings of the p-block elements B-I were computed using the 4c-CASSCF, 4c-CASPT2, and 4c-MR-CISD+Q methods, as recently implemented in BAGEL, with uncontracted Dunning basis sets. Comparison with experiment reveals that the four-component methods yield good results, with most of the computed splittings falling within 15{\%} of the experimental values. A large basis set is needed to obtain accurate splittings of the light elements B-F, while splittings of heavier elements show little basis dependence. The 4c-MR-CISD+Q method gave the best splittings for light elements, while 4c-CASSCF showed the best splittings for elements beyond fluorine. The 4c-CASPT2 method gave the best splittings for group 13 atoms.},

Quantitative SOC operators are discussed, and the symmetry properties of the SOC Hamiltonian important for understanding the general features of SOC are summarized. Comparison of the one- and two-electron contributions to SOC is given, followed bya discussion of commonlyused approximations for the two-electron part. Applications of SOC to studies using effective and model core potentials have been analysed. The theoretical discussion is illustrated with numerous practical examples, including diatomic molecules (with an emphasis on hydrides) and some examples for polyatomic molecules. The fine structure of the SOC interaction (vibrational dependence) for some diatomic molecules has been elucidated.},

    abstract = { The recently proposed spin-adapted time-dependent density functional theory (S-TD-DFT) is extended to the relativistic domain for fine-structure splittings of excited states of open-shell systems. Scalar-relativistic effects are treated to infinite order via the spin-free (sf) part of the exact two-component (X2C) Hamiltonian, whereas the spin–orbit couplings (SOC) between the scalar-excited states are treated perturbatively via an effective one-electron spin–orbit operator derived from the same X2C Hamiltonian. The calculated results for prototypical open-shell systems containing heavy elements reveal that the composite approach sf-X2C-S-TD-DFT-SOC is very promising. The fine-structure splitting of a spatially degenerate ground state can also be described properly by taking a non-degenerate excited state as the reference. }

    abstract = {Abstract Here, we report the catalytic effect of vibrational strong coupling (VSC) on the solvolysis of para-nitrophenyl acetate (PNPA), which increases the reaction rate by an order of magnitude. This is observed when the microfluidic Fabry–Perot cavity in which the VSC is generated is tuned to the C=O vibrational stretching mode of both the reactant and solvent molecules. Thermodynamic experiments confirm the catalytic nature of VSC in the system. The change in the reaction rate follows an exponential relation with respect to the coupling strength of the solvent, indicating a cooperative effect between the solvent molecules and the reactant. Furthermore, the study of the solvent kinetic isotope effect clearly shows that the vibrational overlap of the C=O vibrational bands of the reactant and the strongly coupled solvent molecules is critical for the catalysis in this reaction. The combination of cooperative effects and cavity catalysis confirms the potential of VSC as a new frontier in chemistry.},

These intriguing hybrid states have been extensively studied over the past decades in a wide range of realizations aiming at both basic science and emerging applications. However, recently, it has been demonstrated that not only optical but also material-related properties, such as chemical reactivity and charge transport, may be significantly altered in the strong coupling regime of light-matter interactions. We show that a nanoscale system, composed of a plasmonic nanoprism strongly coupled to excitons in a J-aggregated form of organic chromophores, experiences modified excited-state dynamics and, therefore, modified photochemical reactivity. Our experimental results reveal that photobleaching, one of the most fundamental photochemical reactions, can be effectively controlled and suppressed by the degree of plasmon-exciton coupling and detuning. In particular, we observe a 100-fold stabilization of organic dyes for the red-detuned nanoparticles. Our findings contribute to understanding of photochemical properties in the strong coupling regime and may find important implications for the performance and improved stability of optical devices incorporating organic dyes.},

Experimentally, Fabry\&\#x2013;Perot cavities, composed of two silver mirrors and filled with P3HT polymer, were photoexposed over tens of hours, and the concentration of the remaining thiophene rings (composing P3HT) was studied as a function of time. It has been found that in the regime of strong coupling with the cavity, characterized by one of the largest values of the Rabi splitting reported in the literature (1.0\&\#x00A0;eV), the normalized rate of photodegradation is reduced threefold, substantially larger than in the weak coupling regime reported in our recent study. This result adds to the toolbox of strong coupling phenomena and paves the road towards long-range control of chemical reactions and catalysis.},

In this description, the strong Coulombic interaction between an excited electron and the charged vacancy it leaves behind (a hole) is automatically taken into account. If, in an optical microcavity, the exciton--photon interaction is strong compared to the excitonic and photonic decay rates, a second quasiparticle, the microcavity polariton, must be introduced to properly account for this coupling2. Coherent, laser-like emission from polaritons has been predicted to occur when the ground-state occupancy of polaritons {\textlangle}ngs{\textrangle}, reaches 1 (ref. 3). This process, known as polariton lasing, can occur at thresholds much lower than required for conventional lasing. Polaritons in organic semiconductors are highly stable at room temperature, but to our knowledge, there has as yet been no report of nonlinear emission from these structures. Here, we demonstrate polariton lasing at room temperature in an organic microcavity composed of a melt-grown anthracene single crystal sandwiched between two dielectric mirrors.},

Here, we use strong coupling in an optical microcavity to mix the electronic transitions of two J-aggregated molecular dyes and use both non-resonant photoluminescence emission and photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy to show that hybrid-polariton states act as an efficient and ultrafast energy-transfer pathway between the two exciton states.

    abstract = { Achieving propagation lengths in hybrid plasmonic systems beyond typical values of tens of micrometers is important for quantum plasmonics applications. We report long-range optical energy propagation due to excitons in semiconductor quantum dots (SQDs) being strongly coupled to surface lattice resonance (SLRs) in silver nanoparticle arrays. Photoluminescence (PL) measurements provide evidence of an exciton-SLR (ESLR) mode extending at least 600 μm from the excitation region. We also observe additional energy propagation with range well beyond the ESLR mode and with dependency on the coupling strength, g, between SQDs and SLR. Cavity quantum electrodynamics calculations capture the nature of the PL spectra for consistent g values, while coupled dipole calculations show a SQD number-dependent electric field decay profile consistent with the experimental spatial PL profile. Our results suggest an exciting direction wherein SLRs mediate long-range interactions between SQDs, having possible applications in optoelectronics, sensing, and quantum information science. }

Pioneering works in this direction have shown the effects of this regime in the excited state reactivity of molecular systems and at the same time have opened up the question of whether it is possible to introduce any modifications in the electronic ground energy landscape which could affect chemical thermodynamics and/or kinetics. In this work, we use a model system of many molecules coupled to a surface-plasmon field to gain insight on the key parameters which govern the modifications of the ground-state potential energy surface. Our findings confirm that the energetic changes per molecule are determined by effects that are essentially on the order of single-molecule light–matter couplings, in contrast with those of the electronically excited states, for which energetic corrections are of a collective nature. Hence the prospects of ultrastrong coupling to change ground-state chemical reactions for the parameters studied in this model are limited. Still, we reveal some intriguing quantum-coherent effects associated with pathways of concerted reactions, where two or more molecules undergo reactions simultaneously and which can be of relevance in low-barrier reactions. Finally, we also explore modifications to nonadiabatic dynamics and conclude that, for our particular model, the presence of a large number of dark states yields negligible effects. Our study reveals new possibilities as well as limitations for the emerging field of polariton chemistry. }

    abstract = {Strong light–matter coupling provides a promising path for the control of quantum matter where the latter is routinely described from first principles. However, combining the quantized nature of light with this ab initio tool set is challenging and merely developing as the coupled light–matter Hilbert space is conceptually different and computational cost quickly becomes overwhelming. In this work, we provide a nonperturbative photon-free formulation of quantum electrodynamics (QED) in the long-wavelength limit, which is formulated solely on the matter Hilbert space and can serve as an accurate starting point for such ab initio methods. The present formulation is an extension of quantum mechanics that recovers the exact results of QED for the zero- and infinite-coupling limit and the infinite-frequency as well as the homogeneous limit, and we can constructively increase its accuracy. We show how this formulation can be used to devise approximations for quantum-electrodynamical density-functional theory (QEDFT), which in turn also allows us to extend the ansatz to the full minimal-coupling problem and to nonadiabatic situations. Finally, we provide a simple local density–type functional that takes the strong coupling to the transverse photon degrees of freedom into account and includes the correct frequency and polarization dependence. This QEDFT functional accounts for the quantized nature of light while remaining computationally simple enough to allow its application to a large range of systems. All approximations allow the seamless application to periodic systems.}}

Here, we propose a quantum-electrodynamical setting to address the coupling of a low-dimensional quantum material to quantized electromagnetic fields in quantum cavities. Using a protoypical model system describing FeSe/SrTiO3 with electron-phonon long-range forward scattering, we study how the formation of phonon polaritons at the two-dimensional interface of the material modifies effective couplings and superconducting properties in a Migdal-Eliashberg simulation. We find that through highly polarizable dipolar phonons, large cavity-enhanced electron-phonon couplings are possible, but superconductivity is not enhanced for the forward-scattering pairing mechanism due to the interplay between coupling enhancement and mode softening. Our results demonstrate that quantum cavities enable the engineering of fundamental couplings in solids, paving the way for unprecedented control of material properties.},

The reaction rate decreased by a factor of up to 5.5 when the Si−C vibrational stretching modes of the reactant were strongly coupled. The relative change in the reaction rate under strong coupling depends on the Rabi splitting energy. Product analysis by GC-MS confirmed the kinetic results. Temperature dependence shows that the activation enthalpy and entropy change significantly, suggesting that the transition state is modified from an associative to a dissociative type. These findings show that vibrational strong coupling provides a powerful approach for modifying and controlling chemical landscapes and for understanding reaction mechanisms.},

    abstract={Much effort over the past decades has been focused on improving carrier mobility in organic thin-film transistors by optimizing the organization of the material or the device architecture. Here we take a different path to solving this problem, by injecting carriers into states that are hybridized to the vacuum electromagnetic field. To test this idea, organic semiconductors were strongly coupled to plasmonic modes to form coherent states that can extend over as many as 105 molecules and should thereby favour conductivity. Experiments show that indeed the current does increase by an order of magnitude at resonance in the coupled state, reflecting mostly a change in field-effect mobility. A theoretical quantum model confirms the delocalization of the wavefunctions of the hybridized states and its effect on the conductivity. Our findings illustrate the potential of engineering the vacuum electromagnetic environment to modify and to improve properties of materials.},

    abstract = {This review provides a brief introduction to the physics of coupled exciton-plasmon systems, the theoretical description and experimental manifestation of such phenomena, followed by an account of the state-of-the-art methodology for the numerical simulations of such phenomena and supplemented by a number of FORTRAN codes, by which the interested reader can introduce himself/herself to the practice of such simulations. Applications to CW light scattering as well as transient response and relaxation are described. Particular attention is given to so-called strong coupling limit, where the hybrid exciton-plasmon nature of the system response is strongly expressed. While traditional descriptions of such phenomena usually rely on analysis of the electromagnetic response of inhomogeneous dielectric environments that individually support plasmon and exciton excitations, here we explore also the consequences of a more detailed description of the molecular environment in terms of its quantum density matrix (applied in a mean field approximation level). Such a description makes it possible to account for characteristics that cannot be described by the dielectric response model: the effects of dephasing on the molecular response on one hand, and nonlinear response on the other. It also highlights the still missing important ingredients in the numerical approach, in particular its limitation to a classical description of the radiation field and its reliance on a mean field description of the many-body molecular system. We end our review with an outlook to the near future, where these limitations will be addressed and new novel applications of the numerical approach will be pursued.}

We hereby present direct evidence of non-radiative energy transfer well beyond the Förster limit for spatially separated donor and acceptor cyanine dyes strongly coupled to a cavity. The transient dynamics and the static spectra show an energy transfer efficiency approaching 37 \% for donor–acceptor distances ≥100 nm. In such systems, the energy transfer process becomes independent of distance as long as the coupling strength is maintained. This is consistent with the entangled and delocalized nature of the polaritonic states.},

Such an interface is an important prerequisite for long distance quantum communication, entanglement assisted sensing and measurement, as well as for scalable photonic quantum computation. We review the developments in light-matter interfaces based on room temperature atomic vapors interacting with propagating pulses via the Faraday effect. This interaction has long been used as a tool for quantum nondemolition detections of atomic spins via light. It was discovered recently that this type of light-matter interaction can actually be tuned to realize more general dynamics, enabling better performance of the light-matter interface as well as rendering tasks possible, which were before thought to be impractical. This includes the realization of improved entanglement assisted and backaction evading magnetometry approaching the Quantum Cramer-Rao limit, quantum memory for squeezed states of light and the dissipative generation of entanglement. A separate, but related, experiment on entanglement assisted cold atom clock showing the Heisenberg scaling of precision is described. We also review a possible interface between collective atomic spins with nano- or micromechanical oscillators, providing a link between atomic and solid state physics approaches towards quantum information processing.},

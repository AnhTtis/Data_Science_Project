To reach high output powers while maintaining good beam quality, the output beams of two identical laser oscillators are polarization-combined.

journal = {Physica Scripta},
abstract = {The three-dimensional evolution of a short laser pulse is considered. The linear stability analysis that takes account of the scattered light convection and predicts a development of pulse modulation at the electron plasma frequency, is carried out. It is demonstrated that a laser pulse with a power above or close to the critical, which is required to provide a pulse relativistic self-focusing, undergoes compression and self-modulation in the course of self-consistent pulse evolution and, as a result, resonant excitation of an extremely strong plasma wave occurs. It is shown that for a properly taken initial pulse and plasma parameters it is possible to obtain a wake field of an extremely high intensity for a fairly long time to provide a new promising outlook for the laser accelerator concept. The influence of plasma inhomogeneity and pulse initial focusing on the considered self-resonant plasma wave excitation is studied.}

Self-focusing due to ponderomotive forces and relativistic effects is investigated. It is found that the stationary self-focusing behaviour of each mechanism treated separately is similar, with several orders of magnitude difference in critical power. In stationary self-focusing due to the combined mechanisms, complete saturation of ponderomotive self-focusing prevents the occurrence of relativistic effects. Self-focusing lengths and minimum radii are given for a large range of beam powers. A characteristic focal spot radius is found which depends only on the plasma density.}

Major innovations, implemented in the WarpX PIC code, include: (i) a three level parallelization strategy that demonstrated performance portability and scaling on millions of A64FX cores and tens of thousands of AMD and Nvidia GPUs (ii) a groundbreaking mesh refinement capability that provides between 1.5× to 4× savings in computing requirements on the science case reported in this paper, (iii) an efficient load balancing strategy between multiple MR levels. The MR PIC code enabled 3D simulations of laser-matter interactions on Frontier, Fugaku, and Summit, which have so far been out of the reach of standard codes. These simulations helped remove a major limitation of compact laserbased electron accelerators, which are promising candidates for next generation high-energy physics experiments and ultra-high dose rate FLASH radiotherapy.},

abstract = {In this Letter we report on the generation of 830 W compressed average power from a femtosecond fiber chirped pulse amplification (CPA) system. In the high-power operation we achieved a compressor throughput of about 90\% by using high-efficiency dielectric gratings. The output pulse duration of 640 fs at 78 MHz repetition rate results in a peak power of 12 MW. Additionally, we discuss further a scaling potential toward and beyond the kilowatt level by overcoming the current scaling limitations imposed by the transversal spatial hole burning.},

Although the physical origin of this effect is not yet fully understood, we discuss possible explanations. Accordingly, several solutions are proposed in this paper to raise the threshold of this effect.},

abstract = {Recent work on high-power fiber amplifiers report on a degradation of the output beam quality or even on the appearance of mode instabilities. By combining the transversally resolved rate equations with a 3D Beam propagation method we have managed to create a model able to provide an explanation of what we believe is at the root of this effect. Even though this beam quality degradation is conventionally linked to transversal hole burning, our simulations show that this alone cannot explain the effect in very large mode area fibers. According to the model presented in this paper, the most likely cause for the beam quality degradation is an inversion-induced grating created by the interplay between modal interference along the fiber and transversal hole burning.},

Additionally compressibility from 1.3 ps to 37 fs is demonstrated.},

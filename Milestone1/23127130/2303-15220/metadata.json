    "abstract": "Is it possible to measure how important soft skills like leadership or teamwork are from the point of view of graduate studies offerings? This paper provides a framework that introduces the concept of network centrality as a practical way to measure the individual importance of soft skills in graduate studies. We examine 230 graduate programs offered by 49 higher education institutions in Colombia to estimate the empirical importance of soft skills in the context of graduate studies offerings. The results show that: a) graduate programs in Colombia tend to share a common set of 31 soft skills in their intended learning outcomes; b) the centrality of these skills varies as a function of the graduate program, although this variation was not statistically significant; and c) while most central soft skills tend to be those related to creativity (i.e., creation or generation of ideas or projects), leadership (to lead or teamwork), and analytical orientation (e.g., evaluating situations and solving problems), less central were those related to empathy (i.e., understanding others and acknowledgment of others), ethical thinking, and critical thinking, posing the question if too much emphasis on most visible skills might imply an unbalance in the opportunities to enhancing other soft skills such as ethical thinking.",

    "abstract": "The gamma-ray burst (GRB) 221009A, with its extreme brightness, has provided the opportunity to explore GRB prompt and afterglow emission behavior on short time scales with high statistics. In conjunction with detection up to very high-energy gamma-rays, studies of this event shed light on the emission processes at work in the initial phases of GRBs emission. Using INTEGRAL/IBIS's soft gamma-ray detector, PICsIT (200-2600 keV), we studied the temporal and spectral evolution during the prompt phase and the early afterglow period. We found a \"flux-tracking\" behavior with the source spectrum \"softer\" when brighter. However the relationship between the spectral index and the flux changes during the burst. The PICsIT light curve shows afterglow emission begins to dominate at ~ T0 + 630s and decays with a slope of 1.6 +/- 0.2, consistent with the slopes reported at soft X-rays.",

    "abstract": "Dialogue-based Relation Extraction (DRE) aims to predict the relation type of argument pairs that are mentioned in dialogue. The latest trigger-enhanced methods propose trigger prediction tasks to promote DRE. However, these methods are not able to fully leverage the trigger information and even bring noise to relation extraction. To solve these problems, we propose TLAG, which fully leverages the trigger and label-aware knowledge to guide the relation extraction. First, we design an adaptive trigger fusion module to fully leverage the trigger information. Then, we introduce label-aware knowledge to further promote our model's performance. Experimental results on the DialogRE dataset show that our TLAG outperforms the baseline models, and detailed analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

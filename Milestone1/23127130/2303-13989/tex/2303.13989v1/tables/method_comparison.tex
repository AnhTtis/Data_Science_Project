        TF-IDF & Calculating the TF-IDF vector representation of both texts and taking their cosine similarity as result. & Similarity Score\\
        N-Gram & Generating the texts 3-Grams and computing their similarity score \citep{Kond}. & Similarity Score\\
        Fuzzy & Uses the Levenshtein distance in a correlation matrix to calculate the similarity between two texts \citep{WenYenFuzzy}. & Similarity Score\\
        GloVe & Represents each text within a global word vector space \citep{pennington-etal-2014-glove}. & Vectorized Texts\\
        Fasttext &  An updated variant of Word2Vec that represents each bag as character n-grams \citep{fasttext}. & Vectorized Texts\\
        BERT & A transformer model that considers the left and right context in all layers \citep{BERT}. & Embedded Texts\\
        T5 & A text-to-text transfer transformer built for translations and similar tasks \citep{T5}. & Embedded Texts\\

In this paper, we focus on 3D point-based network pruning and design a 3D channel pruning plug-in (\cpt) that can be used with existing 2D CNN pruning methods.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first pruning work explicitly considering the characteristics of point cloud data and point-based networks.
Empirically, we show that the proposed {\cpt} is universally effective for a wide range of point-based networks and 3D tasks.

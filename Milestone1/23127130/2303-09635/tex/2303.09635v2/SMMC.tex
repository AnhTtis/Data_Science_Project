\begin{abstract}
Motivated by applications in hydrodynamics and networks of thermostatically-control loads in buildings we study control of linear dynamical systems driven by additive and also multiplicative noise of a general position. Utilizing mathematical theory of stochastic multiplicative processes we present a universal way to  estimate fat, algebraic tails of the state vector probability distributions. This motivates us to introduce and analyze  Mean-$q$-Power stability criterion, generalizing the mean-square stability criterion, and then juxtapose these techniques to other, classic tools in control.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

Study of multiplicative noise models has a long  history in control,  with many foundational results reported in late 20ies century and early 21st century  \cite{kats_stability_1960,kushner_stochastic_1967,wonham_optimal_1967,kozin_survey_1969,kleinman_optimal_1969,mclane_optimal_1971,willems_feedback_1976,bernstein_robust_1987,

\footnote{See also a review-like recent paper \cite{gravell_robust_2020} and references therein.}. %analyzing the noise as a way to model uncertainty in the parameters expressing linear dependence on state vector in the basic dynamic equations. 
These classic approaches included testing stability of the control solutions perturbing parameters with white-Gaussian noise, analyzing the mean-square stability measure \cite{kleinman_optimal_1969,boyd_linear_1994}, %,guojun_shi_state_1995
and also studying the multiplicative version of the Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control problem by solving the generalized Ricatti equations \cite{wonham_optimal_1967,mclane_optimal_1971}, then followed by  a path to efficient resolution via semi-definite-programming computations of the linear inequality type \cite{boyd_linear_1994,el_ghaoui_state-feedback_1995}. %,weiwei_li_estimation_2005}.

This letter, inspired by applications in hydrodynamics and thermal control of buildings, and also by theoretical overlap with studies in stochastic multiplicative processes \cite{ruelle_ergodic_1979,goldhirsch_stability_1987} and in statistical hydrodynamics \cite{ 
%batchelor_small-scale_1959,kraichnan_small,scale_1968,shraiman_lagrangian_1994,chertkov_statistics_1995,bernard_slow_1998,balkovsky_universal_1999,
falkovich_particles_2001}, suggests the following complementary (and to the best of our knowledge novel) contribution to the classic subject of stability and control of the multiplicative linear systems:\\ 
(1) We introduce and analyze effect of a multiplicative noise of a general position,  that is possibly not white and non-Gaussian, on stability of a linear state feedback solution. %This analysis, started with the case of the white-Gaussian noise, included comparing direct estimation of the state vector probability distribution with solution of the Kolmogorov-Fokker-Planck (KFP) equation in the steady state (infinite time) regime. 
%We introduce the Mean-$q$-Power (M$q$P) stability criterion, requiring that the mean of the $q/2$-th moment of the state-vector squared, $\lim_{t\to\infty}\mathbb{E}[(\x\x^T)^{q/2}]$ is finite, which is a generalization of the standard, $q=2$, mean-square stability criterion.  
Utilizing the theory of  stochastic multiplicative processes, and specifically the so-called Oseledets theorem
\cite{ruelle_ergodic_1979,goldhirsch_stability_1987,falkovich_particles_2001}, we observe that if the probability distribution of the state vector stabilizes, it shows fat, algebraic tail,  with the exponent which scales linearly with the vector of the feedback rates. Moreover, we express the algebraic exponent via  universal characteristics of the so-called time-ordered exponential of the multiplicative matrix, in particular via Cram\'{e}r function of the Lyapunov exponents measuring the exponential rates of growth of uncertainty in different components of the initial state vector. Our analysis also reveals that at the times larger than inverse of the largest Lyapunov exponent ANY multiplicative noise can be described by a white-Gaussian substitute with a properly re-normalized covariance.\\
(2) Motivated by (1) we introduce the Mean-$q$-Power (M$q$P) stability criterion, requiring that the mean of the $q/2$-th moment of the state-vector squared, $\lim_{t\to\infty}\mathbb{E}[(\x\x^T)^{q/2}]$ is finite. (This criterion is a generalization of the standard in control theory mean-square stability criterion, correspondent to the case of $q=2$.) Flexibility in the choice of $q$ in the M$q$P criterion helps us to better test stability of the feedback control. Exploring the regime of the ``slower than inverse of the largest Lyapunov exponent" control, and thus replacing multiplicative noise of a general position by white-Gaussian, we are able, following classic approaches of the control theory  to estimate minimal linear-state feedback which guarantees the M$q$P-stability and then verify consistency with the long time asymptotic of the noise-multiplicative version of the Linear Quadratic Gaussian approach. %(b) verify that the mean-square stability approach is fully consistent with respective solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Belman (HJB) (generalized Ricatti) equations considered at $t\to\infty$. 





\section{Basic Dynamic Model}\label{sec:basic}

Consider stochastic dynamics of a state vector, ${\bm x}(t)\in \mathbb{R}^d$,  which is governed by the following linear equation:
\begin{gather}\label{eq:SDE}
    \frac{dx_i}{dt}=\sum\limits_j \left(m_{ij}+\sigma_{ij}(t)\right) x_j(t) +\xi_i(t) +u_i(t),
\end{gather}
where $i=1,\cdots,d$ and ${\bm m}\doteq (m_{ij}|i,j=1,\cdots,d)$ is a constant matrix, ${\bm \xi}(t)\doteq (\xi_i(t)|i=1,\cdots, d)$ is a zero-mean white-Gaussian noise (integral of a Wiener process) fully described by 
\begin{gather*} %\label{eq:Xi}
\forall i,j:\quad \mathbb{E}\left[\xi_i(t)\xi_j(t')\right]=\kappa_i \delta_{ij}\delta(t-t');
\end{gather*}
${\bm u}(t)=(u_i(t)|i=1,\cdots,d)$ is a vector of control; and the multiplicative matrix, ${\bm \sigma}(t)=(\sigma_{ij}(t)|i,j=1,\cdots,d)$ is a zero-mean stochastic and independent of the vector of additive noise, ${\bm \xi}$. 
We consider two ways to model , ${\bm \sigma}$, in Eq.~(\ref{eq:SDE}) -- {\it special} and {\it general}. In the {\it special} case ${\bm\sigma}$  is white-Gaussian  with a constant covariance. To introduce the {\it general} model of ${\bm\sigma}(t)$ we consider an auxiliary multiplicative dynamics
\begin{gather}\label{eq:W}
     \frac{d}{dt}{\bm W}={\bm \sigma} {\bm W},
\end{gather}
where the matrix ${\bm W}\in \mathbb{R}^d\times \mathbb{R}^d$ is called the time-ordered exponential of ${\bm \sigma}$, and thus denoted as ${\bm W}=T\exp(\int_0^t dt' {\bm \sigma}(t'))$. According to the Oseledets theorem
(see \cite{ruelle_ergodic_1979,goldhirsch_stability_1987,falkovich_particles_2001} and references there in) at sufficiently large  times, $t$, the matrix
$\log ({\bm W}^+{\bm W})/t$ stabilizes. That is eigenvectors of the matrix tend to $d$ fixed orthonormal eigenvectors, ${\bm f}_i$, of ${\bm W}$, and  the respective eigenvalues $\lambda_i \doteq \log |{\bm W} {\bm f}_i|/t$, stabilizes to their mean-values asymptotically, i.e. finite time statistics of $\lambda_i$ is 
\begin{gather}\label{eq:Cramer}
    \hspace{-0.5cm}\text{\underline{general}}:\ P(\lambda_1,\cdots, \lambda_d|t)\propto \exp\left(-t S(\lambda_1,\cdots,\lambda_d)\right), 
\end{gather}
where $S(\cdot)$, called the Cr\'amer function, is convex, and the Lyapunov exponents are ordered: $\lambda_1\geq \lambda_2\geq \cdots \lambda_d$. 

In the rest of this Section we present two examples where the basic stochastic dynamic model applies.

\subsection{Active and Passive Swimmers}\label{sec:swimmers}

We consider a smooth, chaotic velocity field of a general position discussed extensively in stochastic hydrodynamics,  see %\cite{batchelor_small-scale_1959,kraichnan_small-scale_1968,shraiman_lagrangian_1994,chertkov_statistics_1995,bernard_slow_1998,balkovsky_universal_1999} and 
review \cite{falkovich_particles_2001} and references therein. Particles/swimmers which are placed in such a flow separate exponentially fast. Our task is to navigate the active swimmer to control its separation from the passive swimmer, assuming that the two were released at the same position initially. The vector of separation of the two swimmers, ${\bm r}=(r_i|i=1,\cdots,d)$ in $d$ dimensions (where $d=2,3$) evolves according to 
\begin{gather}\label{eq:swim-r}
    -\alpha \left(\frac{d{\bm r}}{dt}-{\bm \sigma}(t) {\bm r}\right)= {\bm u}(t)+ {\bm  {\xi}}(t),
\end{gather}
where $\alpha$ is the friction coefficient (which we set to unity without loss of generality) and ${\bm u}$ and ${\bm  {\xi}}$ are control force exerted by the active swimmer and the difference of the thermal forces acting on the active and thermal swimmers, respectively. Following assumptions which are standard in stochastic hydrodynamics \cite{falkovich_particles_2001} we will model, ${\bm \sigma}(t)$ and ${\bm  {\xi}}$ as stochastic and independent. 


\subsection{Dynamics of Temperature in Multi-Zone Buildings}\label{sec:building}

We follow a ``gray box" modeling of the multi-zone building describing thermal exchange between a zone and outside environment, and between a zone and the building's Air Handling Unit (AHU), as  discussed in \cite{valenzuela_statistical_2022} (see also references therein), and then generalize the model to account for thermal exchange between neighboring zones \cite{picard_impact_2017}. 

Consider, first, the case were temporal profiles of the environment outside of a particular zone, $T_o$, and the supply temperature (of AHU), $T_s$, are given (exogenous). We model evolution of this zone temperature in time, $T(t)$, by the following equation
\begin{gather}\label{eq:T}
\frac{d T}{dt}=-c_o(T-T_o)-c_s(T-T_s)u(t)+\xi(t),
\end{gather}
where $c_o$ and $c_s$ are rates modeling thermal exchange between the zone $i$ and the "outside" (which can be viewed as outside of the building, but also representing an aggregation of other zones of the building) and the AHU, respectively (the rates are measured in the units of inverse time); $ \dot{\xi}(t)$ is the white-Gaussian noise modeling additive fluctuations, with the covariance, $\kappa$, proportional to occupancy and thus expressing behavioral uncertainty; $u(t)$ is control of the opening in the pipe connecting zone $i$ to the supply (AHU). Given fluctuations of the zone's occupancy in time, it is also reasonable to model its contribution to the thermal exchange with the "outside"  as split into the mean (constant or slowly dependent on time) and uncertain (thus stochastic) term,
%\begin{gather}
$c_{o}= \underline{c}_{o}+ \sigma(t)$.
%\label{eq:c-stochastic}\end{gather}
%As discussed below in more details, significance of this term is in the fact that fluctuation of $\sigma(t)$ are multiplicative (i.e. entering in Eq.~(\ref{eq:T}) multiplied by $T-T_o$) thus resulting in much stronger fluctuations of the resulting $T(t)$.

Now, suppose that the outside temperature, $T_o$, and the supply temperature, $T_s$, are constant and assume that a single zone control, $u(t)$, is split into constant and linear feedback components, $u(t)=\underline{u}+\phi\theta$, where $\theta=T-\underline{T}$ is deviation from the desired comfort temperature, $\underline{T}$, and the constant component of the control, $\bar{u}$, is chosen/fixed according to
$0=-\underline{c}_o(\underline{T}-T_o)-c_s(\underline{T}-T_s)\underline{u}$, thus guaranteeing that 
$T$ stabilizes at $\underline{T}$, assuming that the $\xi$, and $\sigma$ noises are absent. Then Eqs.~(\ref{eq:T}) results in the following stochastic ODE for $\theta$,
\begin{gather}\label{eq:theta}
\frac{d \theta}{dt}=-c(\phi)\theta+\tilde{\xi}(t)-\sigma(t)\theta,
\end{gather} 
where, $c(\phi)\doteq c_0+c_1\phi$, $c_0\doteq \underline{c}_o+c_s\underline{u}$, $c_1\doteq c_s(\underline{T}-T_s)$ and $\tilde{\xi}(t)\doteq \xi(t)+T_o \sigma (t)$. 

Network generalization of Eq.~(\ref{eq:theta}), accounting for thermal flows between zones, results in the following system of equations for the components of the temperature vector (counted from the comfort temperature, $\underline{T}$, set the same for all zones in the building), ${\bm \theta}=(\theta_i|i\in\V)$, where $\V$ stands for the set of zones:
\begin{align} \label{eq:theta_i} 
\hspace{-0.3cm}\frac{d \theta_i}{dt}\!\!=\!\!-\!\left(\! c_i({\bm \phi})\!+\!\sigma_{io}\right)\theta_i 
\!-\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\sum\limits_{j:\{i,j\}\in \E}\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\left(\underline{c}_{ij}\!+\!\sigma_{ij}\!\right)(\theta_i\!-\!\theta_j) \!+\!\xi_i(t).
\end{align}
Here in Eq.~(\ref{eq:theta_i}),  $\E$ denotes the set of edges in the network linking neighboring zones;  $c_{ij}$ is the rate of thermal exchange between the pair of neighboring zones, $(i,j)\in\E$; it is assumed that the constant components of control vector, $\underline{\bm u}=(\underline{u}_i|i\in\V)$, are chosen according 
to, $\forall i:\ 0=\underline{c}_{io}(\underline{T}-T_o)+c_{is}(\underline{T}-T_s)\underline{u}_i$, where $c_{io}$ and $c_{is}$ are the rates of thermal exchange, respectively, between zone $i$ and the outside environment, kept at the constant temperature, $T_o$, and between zone $i$ and the AHU, kept at the constant temperature, $T_s$; and $ c_i({\bm \phi})\doteq \underline{c}_{io}+\sum_j c_{js}(\underline{T}-T_s)\phi_{ij}$, where ${\bm \phi}\doteq(\phi_{ij}|i,j\in\V)$ is vector of the linear feedback rates. We also assume that both $c_{io}$ and $c_{ij}$ are split into constant and fluctuating parts,
$\forall i:\ c_i\doteq \underline{c}_{io}+\sigma_{io};\ \forall (i,j):\ c_{ij}\doteq \underline{c}_{ij}+ \sigma_{ij}(t)$.

It is clear that Eq.~(\ref{eq:swim-r}), with ${\bm r}$ substituted by ${\bm x}$, Eqs.~(\ref{eq:theta},\ref{eq:theta_i}) with ${\bm \theta}$ substitute by ${\bm x}$, with properly re-defined uncertainty/noise terms, constitutes particular cases of Eqs.~(\ref{eq:SDE}).

\section{Control of Steady State (CSS)} \label{sec:CSS}

Consider state feedback control, that is
%\begin{gather}\label{eq:w(x)}
    ${\bm u}(t)\to \w(\x(t))$,
%\end{gather}
where $\w(\cdot)$ is a yet-to-be-defined (parameterized) function. Then, Eqs.~(\ref{eq:SDE}), also supplemented with the additional assumption that ${\bm \sigma}$ is white-Gaussian results in the following  stationary Kolmogorov-Fokker-Planck (KFP) equation for the probability density function, $P({\bm x})$, of the stationary stochastic vector ${\bm x}(t)$:
\begin{align}\label{eq:KFP}
\hat{\cal L}P(\x|\{w\})=0,\quad \hat{\cal L} = &
\partial_{x_i}\left(w_i({\bm x})+m_{ij} x_j\right)\\ \nonumber  & + \kappa_{ij}\partial_{x_i}\partial_{x_j}+D_{ik;jl}\partial_{x_i}x_k  \partial_{x_j} x_l,
\end{align}
where $\hat{\cal L}$ is a second order differential operator while $\kappa$ and $D$ are elements of the matrix and tensor of covariances associated with the additive and multiplicative terms, respectively. 
%\misha{ ... need to double check the "advection" term ... plan to write an appendix with derivation ... but probably not in this (letter), but extended version of the text"}

Assuming that the statistical steady state is achieved, i.e. that solution of the stationary KFP equation is well-defined, we pose the following
steady version of the stochastic optimal control 
\begin{align} \nonumber 
     &{\bm\phi}^*=\text{arg}\min\limits_{{\bm \phi}} \bar{C}({\bm\phi}),\quad \bar{C}({\bm\phi})=\int d\x P(\x|\w_{\bm \phi}) C(\x,\w_{\bm\phi}),\\ 
& C(\x,\w_{\phi}) =\underbrace{C_c(\w_{\phi})}_{\text{cost of control}}+\underbrace{C_g(\x)}_{\text{cost of achieving the goal}}, \label{eq:steady-control}
\end{align}
where $\phi$ stands for a vector of parameters selected to represent the function $\w_{\bm \phi}(\cdots)$.

Notice, that the CSS analysis will also help us to solve the M$q$P-stability problem.  Indeed, the $\phi$-parameterized linear state feedback is M$q$P-stable if  
\begin{gather}\label{eq:C-q}
\int d\x P(\x|\w_{\bm \phi}) (\x \x^T)^{q/2},
\end{gather} 
is well defined, i.e. convergent. This observation explains our choice of the cost-of-achieving-the-goal in the M$q$P form, $C_g(\x)\to \beta (\x \x^T)^{q/2}$, in the following Subsections,  where we discuss solution of the CSS problem on our two enabling examples.


\subsection{Swimmers CSS: short-correlated large-scale flow}\label{sec:swimmers-CSS}

Consider the swimmers' linear state feedback version of Eqs.~(\ref{eq:steady-control}),  thus with ${\bm x}$ substituted by ${\bm r}$,
\begin{gather}
    \label{eq:simple-swimmers} 
    \hspace{-0.3cm} {\bm u}(t)\to {\bm w}({\bm r})=\phi r,\  C_c\{\w\}\to \w^2,\ C_g({\bm r})\to \beta r^q,
\end{gather}
and apply to the stochastic dynamics governed by Eq.~(\ref{eq:swim-r}).
Let us also choose Batchelor-Kraichnan model for the chaotic flow in $d$-dimensions  described by the following pair-correlation function of the velocity gradient matrix, ${\bm \sigma}$, entering Eq.~(\ref{eq:swim-r}):
\begin{align}\label{eq:sigma-cov}
    & \forall i,j,k,l=1,\cdots,d:\  \mathbb{E}\left[\sigma_{ij}(t)\sigma_{kl}(t')\right]= \\ \nonumber & \hspace{0.5cm} D (d+1)\delta(t-t')\left(\delta_{jl}\delta_{ik}-\frac{\delta_{ij}\delta_{kl}+\delta_{jk}\delta_{il}}{d+1}\right),
\end{align}
where $\delta(\cdot)$ and $\delta_{ij}$ are the $\delta$-function and the Kronecker symbol respectively. Then,  the KFP Eq.~(\ref{eq:KFP}) for the spherically symmetric probability density %$P({\bm r}|\w_{\bm \phi})$, which we now denote 
$P(r|\phi)$, where $r=|{\bm r}|$, becomes
(see \cite{chertkov_how_1998} for details)
\begin{align}\label{eq:KFP-swimmers}
& {\cal L}_{sw}P(r|\phi)=0,\\ \nonumber & {\cal L}_{sw}=r^{1-d}\frac{d}{dr} r^d\left(\phi+\frac{1}{2}\left(D (d-1)r+\frac{\kappa}{r}\right)\frac{d}{dr}\right).
\end{align}
Here in Eq.~(\ref{eq:KFP-swimmers}), $\kappa$ stands for covariance of the thermal noise in Eq.~(\ref{eq:swim-r}). Solution of Eq.~(\ref{eq:KFP-swimmers}) is 
\begin{align}\label{eq:P-sw}
& P(r|\phi) =N^{-1}\left(\frac{\kappa}{D}+(d-1)r^2\right)^{-\phi/((d-1)D)},\\ \nonumber
& N = 2^{\phi/(d-1)} d \left(\frac{(d-1)D}{\kappa \pi}\right)^{d/2} \frac{\Gamma\left(\phi/(D(d-1))\right)}{\Gamma\left(\phi/(D(d-1))-d/2\right)},
\end{align}
where $N$ is the normalization coefficient which guarantees that, $\int_0^\infty \Omega_r  dr P(r|\phi)=1$, $\Omega_r=(\pi^{d/2}/\Gamma(d/2+1)) r^{d-1}$.
The solution is valid, i.e. the normalization integral is bounded, if $\phi> (d-1) d D/2$.

Substituting $P(r|\phi)$, given by Eq.~(\ref{eq:P-sw}) into Eq.~(\ref{eq:steady-control}) with $C_c(\cdots)$ and $C_g(\cdots)$ chosen according to Eq.~(\ref{eq:simple-swimmers}), we observe that that the cost of control is well-defined, i.e. the respective integral converges and the control is M$q$P-stable at $\phi\geq \phi^{(s)}=(d+q)(d-1)/2$. To find optimal $\phi^{(*)}$, which should obviously be larger than the M$q$P value, $\phi^{(*)}>\phi^{(s)}$, one needs to solve a straightforward one-parametric convex optimization. The solution, which is generally a bulky but explicit expression in terms of special function simplifies in the $q=2$ case: 
\begin{align} %\nonumber  
    \phi^* 
    %&= \text{arg}\min\limits_{\phi> (d-1) d D/2} \frac{ \left(\beta +(\phi/D)^2\right) \Gamma \left(-\frac{d}{2}+\frac{\phi/D}{d-1}-1\right)}{\Gamma \left(\frac{\phi/D}{d-1}-\frac{d}{2}\right)}\\    &
    = \frac{D(d\!+\!2)(d\!-\!1)\!+\!\sqrt{4\beta\!+\!D^2(d\!+\!2)^2(d\!-\!1)^2}}{2}.\label{eq:steady-swimmers-opt} 
\end{align}


\subsection{Thermal CSS: single zone}\label{sec:thermal-CSS}

Assuming that $\tilde{\xi}(t)$ and $\sigma(t)$ in Eq.~(\ref{eq:theta}) are zero-mean, independent and white-Gaussian  with the pair correlation functions described by
\begin{gather}\label{eq:-tilde-xi+sigma}
    \mathbb{E}\left[\tilde{\xi}(t)\tilde{\xi}(t')\right]/\kappa =\mathbb{E}\left[\sigma(t)\sigma(t')\right]/D=\delta(t-t'),
\end{gather}
we arrive at the following KFP equation for the probability distribution function of $\theta$ 
\begin{gather}\label{eq:KFP-thermal}
\left(\partial_\theta c(\phi)\theta +\kappa\partial^2_\theta +D(\partial_\theta \theta)^2\right)P(\theta|\phi)=0.
\end{gather} 
Solution of Eq.~(\ref{eq:KFP-thermal}), 
\begin{gather}\label{eq:thermal-stat}
    \vspace{-0.2cm} P(\theta|\phi)\!=\!\sqrt{\frac{D}{\pi\kappa}}\frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{c(\phi)}{2D}\!+\!\frac{1}{2}\right)}{\Gamma\left(\frac{c(\phi)}{2D}\right)}\left(\!1\!+\!\frac{D\theta^2}{\kappa}\!\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}-\frac{c(\phi)}{2D}}\!,
\end{gather}
is normalizable if $c(\phi)>0$. Then, expectation of the cost, evaluated according to Eqs.~(\ref{eq:steady-control}), %,\ref{eq:simple-thermal}), 
is finite and convex at $c(\phi)=c_0+c_1\phi >D(\max(q,2)-1)$, i.e. the system is M$q$P-stable at $\phi>\phi^{(s)}\doteq (D(\max(q,2)-1)-c_0)/c_1$. The optimal value is achieved at $\phi^* >\phi^{(s)}$ which returns the following explicit expression at $q=2$:
\begin{align}
    \phi^* =\frac{2D-c_0+\sqrt{(2D-c_0)^2+\beta c_1^2}}{c_1}.
    \label{eq:phi*-thermo}
\end{align} 

\subsection{Thermal CSS: multi-zone}\label{sec:thermal-CSS-multi}

Assuming that $\xi_{i}$, $\sigma_{io}$ and $\sigma_{ij}$, entering Eq.~(\ref{eq:theta_i}) are independent, zero mean, white-Gaussian  with covariances, $\kappa_{i}$, $D_{io}$ and $D_{ij}$, respectively, we arrive at the following multi-zone version of the single-zone KFP Eq.~(\ref{eq:KFP-thermal}):
\begin{align}\label{eq:KFP-multi}
&\hat{\cal L}_{m} P({\bm \theta}|{\bm \phi})\!=\!0,\\ \nonumber   & \hat{\cal L}_{m} \! \doteq \!\!\!\!
\sum\limits_{i\in\V}\!\!\!  
\left(c_i\hat{l}_i+D_{io}(\hat{l}_i)^2\!+\!\!\kappa_i\partial_{\theta_i}^2\right)\!+\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\sum\limits_{\{i,j\}\in \E}\!\!\!\!  \left(\underline{c}_{ij} \hat{l}_{ij}\!+\! D_{ij} (\hat{l}_{ij})^2\right),
\end{align}
where  ${\bm \theta}\doteq(\theta_i|i\in\V)$; $\hat{l}_i$ $\hat{l}_{ij}$ are the following first order differential operators in ${\bm \theta}$: $\hat{l}_i\doteq \partial_{\theta_i} \theta_i$, 
$\hat{l}_{ij}\doteq(\partial_{\theta_i}\!-\!\partial_{\theta_j})(\theta_i\!-\!\theta_j)$.
Interested %to analyze the KFP equation 
to establish threshold for the M$q$P, and recalling that it is controlled solely by convergence of the respective integrals at the large values of $|\theta_i|$, $|\theta_i|\gg \sqrt{\kappa/D}$ (where $\kappa$ and $D$ are the largest and smallest respective coefficients over the network),  we ignore the $\kappa$ term in Eq.~(\ref{eq:KFP-multi}) and observe that the resulting version of the $\hat{\cal L}_{m}$ operator is scale-invariant. This suggests that the large $\theta$ asymptotic solution of the KFP equations is a scale-invariant zero modes of the $\kappa=0$ version of $\hat{\cal L}_{m}$, thus resulting in the fat, algebraic tail.  

%\misha{ ... to be continued ... the formulation is too difficult to allow analytic solution ... there exists a few options on how to proceed, such as  (a) just stop here (with analytics) suggesting that some further numerical exploration is needed; (b) build a mean-field approximation (more like buildings with a lot of open-spaces and multi-zones all cross-neighboring each other); (c) study a tree-like graph (starting with linear-graph or, simply, two zones) and then generalize it to a belief-propagation approximation ... } 


\section{Fat Tails}\label{sec:fat-tails}

KFP analysis of the linear feedback control in the previous Section reveals that at the large values of the state vector and under assumption that a steady state is achievable the state vector's  probability distribution function shows fat algebraic tails, see e.g. \ref{eq:P-sw},\ref{eq:thermal-stat} and concluding discussion of Section \ref{sec:thermal-CSS-multi}.  Are these results, derived under the assumption of the special short-Gaussian model of the multiplicative noise, incidental or general?

In this Section,  which is arguably the main one of the letter, we utilize the general mathematical theory of stochastic processes \cite{ruelle_ergodic_1979,goldhirsch_stability_1987} to show that the fat algebraic tails are in fact general. 
%estimate algebraic tail of the stationary probability distribution function of the state vector modulus, $P_{st}(|{\bm x}||{\bm\phi})=\lim_{t\to\infty} P(|{\bm x}||t,{\bm\phi})$, (and also of its projections to the eigenvalues of ${\bm W}$) assuming a linear feedback control, parameterized by the vector of parameters, ${\bm\phi}$. 

\subsection{Swimmers in a general large scale flow}\label{sec:swimmers-general}

Consider the case of a general large scale flow, often named in the stochastic hydrodynamics literature the Batchelor case. %.  In this general case we intend to extend the approach of \cite{balkovsky_universal_1999} to analysis of the probability distribution function of the distance between active and passive swimmers, $p(r)$, in the situation of the constant in time control set up by Eqs.~(\ref{eq:simple-swimmers}). 
Then, forward in time solution of Eq.~(\ref{eq:swim-r}) becomes
\begin{align}\label{eq:swim-solution}
    {\bm r}(t)\!=\!e^{-\phi t}{\bm W}(t)\!\left(\!\!{\bm r}(0)\!+\!\int\limits_0^t \!dt' e^{\phi t'} {\bm W}^{-1}(t'){\bm \xi}(t')\!\!\right),
\end{align}
where the time-ordered exponential, ${\bm W}(t)$, satisfies Eq.~(\ref{eq:W}). We will study the large time statistics of $r(t)=|{\bm r}(t)|$, where the initial separation is forgotten, and thus the first term within the brackets on the right hand side of Eq.~(\ref{eq:swim-solution}) can be dropped. Moreover, one can see, following the logic of \cite{balkovsky_universal_1999} (see also references therein),  that in the long-time regime, where the inter-swimmer separation, $r(t)$ is significantly larger than the so-called diffusive scale, $r_d\doteq \sqrt{|\lambda|/\kappa}$ and $\lambda(t)\doteq \max_i (\lambda_i|i=1,\cdots,d)$ is the largest (finite-time) Lyapunov exponent of the Batchelor flow, the fluctuations of ${\bm r}(t)$ are mainly due to the Lyapunov exponents, distributed according to Eq.~(\ref{eq:Cramer}). In other words, in this asymptotic we can approximate the inter-swimmer distance by
\begin{gather}\label{eq:swim-asymptotic}
   r(t)\approx exp\left((\lambda_1(t)-\phi)t\right) r_d. 
\end{gather}
Consistently with Eq.~(\ref{eq:Cramer}), statistics of $\lambda_1$ is governed by
\begin{gather}\label{eq:Cramer-largest}
   P(\lambda_1|t)\propto \exp\left(-t S_1(\lambda_1)\right), 
\end{gather}
where thus $S_1(\lambda_1)$ is the Cr\'{a}mer function of the largest Lyapunov exponent of the Batchelor flow achieving its minimum at $\bar{\lambda}_1$. Substituting $\lambda_1(t)$, expressed via $r(t)$ according to Eq.~(\ref{eq:swim-asymptotic}), into Eq.~(\ref{eq:Cramer-largest}), and expanding $S_1(\cdot)$ in the Taylor Series around $\bar{\lambda}_1$, we arrive at the following asymptotic expression for statistics of $r(t)$:
\begin{align}\nonumber 
    & P(r|t) \frac{r^{d-1}}{r_d^d}\propto \exp\left(-t S_1\left(t^{-1}\log\left(\frac{r}{r_d}\right)+\phi\right)\right)\\ 
    \nonumber & \to\! \exp\left(\!-t\!\left(\!S_1(\bar{\lambda}_1)\!+\!\left(\frac{1}{t}\log\left(\frac{r}{r_d}\right)\!+\!\phi\!-\!\bar{\lambda}_1\!\right)^2 S''_1(\bar{\lambda}_1)\right)\!\right)\\
    \label{eq:swim-general-statistics}
    & \to\Big|_{t\to\infty;\ r\gg r_d} P_{st}(r) \frac{r^{d-1}}{r_d^d}\propto \left(\frac{r_d}{r}\right)^{2(\phi-\bar{\lambda}_1) S''_1(\bar{\lambda}_1)}.
\end{align}
Notice, that the stationary version of the last line in Eq.~(\ref{eq:swim-general-statistics}) settles if $\phi>\bar{\lambda}_1+1/(2S''(\bar{\lambda}_1))$, and that it is fully consistent with Eq.~(\ref{eq:P-sw}), derived for the short ($\delta$)-correlated velocity gradient, then $S''_1(\bar{\lambda}_1)=1/((d-1)D)$ and $\bar{\lambda}_1=(d-1)^2 D/2$.

\subsection{Temperature Extremes in a Multi-zone Building}\label{sec:thermal-general}

We assume that additive fluctuations (associated with human activity within each zone of the building) sets the scale, $\theta_d$, for the central part of the probability distribution of ${\bm \theta}{\bm f}_i^T$,  which is projection of the vector of state, ${\bm \theta}$ to the $i$-th eigen-vector, ${\bm f}_i$ of the time-ordered exponential matrix, ${\bm W}=T\exp(\int_0^t dt'\tilde{\bm \sigma}(t')$, where $\forall i,j:\ \tilde{\sigma}_{ij}\doteq -\sigma_{io}\delta_{ij}-\sigma_{ij}$.  Then, generalizing considerations of the previous subsection to the case of the dynamics of ${\bm \theta}$ in a multi-zone building governed by Eq.~(\ref{eq:theta_i}), we estimate
\begin{align}\label{eq:theta-fat1}
    {\bm\theta}{\bm f}_i^T\!\gg\!\theta_d:\ \frac{{\bm\theta}{\bm f}_i^T}{\theta_d}\!\sim\! \exp\left(\lambda_i(t)\!-\!{\bm f}_i\left(\bm c({\bm\phi})\!+\!{\bm\Delta}_{\underline{c}}\right){\bm f}_i^T\right),
\end{align}
where ${\bm\Delta}_{\underline{c}}$ is the graph Laplacian matrix of the heat network, ${\cal G}$, weighted with the elements of the matrix of the inter-zone thermal conductivities, $\underline{c}\doteq (\underline{c}_{ij}|(i,j)\in\E)$; ${\bm c}({\bm \phi})\doteq (c_i({\bm \phi})|i\in\V)$.  Therefore, repeating evaluations leading to Eq.(\ref{eq:swim-general-statistics}) we derive that at ${\bm\theta}{\bm f}_i^T\!\gg\!\theta_d$:
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:multi-general-tail}
  \log P_{st}({\bm\theta}{\bm f}_i^T) \propto 2 {\bm f}_i\left({\bm c}({\bm\phi})\!+\!{\bm\Delta}_{\underline{c}}\right){\bm f}_i^T S''_i(0)\log\frac{\theta_d}{{\bm\theta}{\bm f}_i^T},
\end{align}
where $S''_i(0)$ is the curvature (second derivative) of the Cr\'{a}mer function associated with the $i$-th Lyapunov exponent of ${\bm W}$. 
\end{comment}

\subsection{General Model: Synthesis}
Assume that ${\bm u}(t)$ in Eq.~(\ref{eq:SDE}) is substituted by a general linear feedback: $u_i(t)\to \sum_j\phi_{ij}x_j$. Then, Eq.~(\ref{eq:swim-solution}) generalizes to
\begin{gather}\label{eq:x-W}
    {\bm x}(t)=e^{-({\bm m}+{\bm \phi})t}{\bm W}(t)\tilde{x},
\end{gather}
where $\tilde{x}$ stabilizes to a constant as $t$ grows. Projecting Eq.~(\ref{eq:x-W}), from both left and right, to the $i$-th eigen-vector, 
${\bm f}_i$ of the time-ordered exponential matrix, ${\bm W}=T\exp(\int_0^t dt'{\bm \sigma}(t')$, considering linear feedback with is sufficiently strong, and repeating steps of the $t\to\infty$ limit equivalent to these shown in Eq.~(\ref{eq:multi-general-tail}), we arrive at 
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:multi-general-tail}
  \log P_{st}({\bm x}{\bm f}_i^T) \propto 2 {\bm f}_i\left({\bm m}+{\bm \phi}\right){\bm f}_i^T S''_i(0)\log\frac{x_d}{{\bm x}{\bm f}_i^T}.
\end{align}
Eq.~(\ref{eq:multi-general-tail}) gives us an explicit and simple expression for the fat tail of $({\bm x}{\bm f}_i^T)$, which is bi-linear in the sum of the system's dynamic matrix ${\bm m}$ and the linear feedback rate, ${\bm \phi}$, and in curvature, $S''_i(0)$, at the minimum of the Cr\'{a}mer function of the $i$-th Lyapunov exponent of ${\bm W}$. 

Two additional remarks are in order. First, notice that dependence on $\tilde{x}$ is ``under logarithm", thus weak and replaced by $x_d$,  which is  an estimate for the size of the center of the probability distribution of $({\bm x}{\bm f}_i^T)$ dependent on the additive noise. Second, it follows from Eq.~(\ref{eq:multi-general-tail}) that statistics of any norm of ${\bm x}$, e.g. $|{\bm x}|$, will be equivalent to statistics of $({\bm x}{\bm f}_1^T)$, associated with the largest Lyapunov exponent, $\lambda_1$. 



\section{Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC)}\label{sec:SOC}

Our next step is to derive and solve Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation associated with the dynamics, governed by Eqs.~(\ref{eq:SDE}), and dynamic version of the cost function described by Eq.~(\ref{eq:steady-control}).  This material is auxiliary (to the main message of the letter) and it is presented here as a check of consistency and also a link to the classic (and thus benchmark) methodology in the field. Derivation of the HJB equations which follow is standard (see e.g. \cite{barber_optimal_2011} and references therein for details) thus abbreviated. 


%presented below is standard -- via greedy dynamic programming averaging over white-Gaussian noise(s) and then followed by optimization over the instantaneous (closed loop) control variable.  See e.g. H. Kappen \cite{barber_optimal_2011} and references therein for details. However, multiplicative noise makes the resulting equations somehow unusual and, to the best of our knowledge, not analyzed in the literature.  
We study a finite horizon version of Eqs.~(\ref{eq:SDE}), evaluated in the ``running time", $\tau$, where $\tau\in [t,t_f]$, and introduce the cost-to-go (action), $S(t,\x)$, considered as a function of $t$ and ${\bm x}(t)$:
\begin{gather} \label{eq:dynamic-control}
   \hspace{-0.3cm} S(t,\x)\!=\!\!\min_{\{{\bm u}(t)\}}\! \!\!\left(\!\! S_f(\x(t_f))\!+\!\!\!\int\limits_{t}^{t_f}\!\! \! d\tau\  \mathbb{E}\left[C(\x(\tau),{\bm u}(\tau))\right]\!\!\right)\!,
\end{gather}
where $S_f(\x(t_f))$ is the contribution to the cost-to-go associated with the final position $\x(t_f)$; and the expectation is over the random ${\bm \xi}(t)$ and ${\bm \sigma}(t)$. % and subject to the dynamics governed by Eqs.~(\ref{eq:SDE},\ref{eq:am}).
Then, $S(t,\x)$ satisfies the following HJB equation, supplemented by the condition, $S(t_f,\x)=S_f(\x)$,
\begin{align}\nonumber
&-\partial_t S(t,\x)  =  \min_{{\bm u}} \Big( C(\x,{\bm u})+
\left(\underline{a}_i+u_i+\underline{m}_{ij} x_j\right)\partial_{x_i}S(t,\x)\\ \label{eq:HJB}
&+\left(\kappa_{ij}\partial_{x_i}\partial_{x_j}+D_{ik;jl}x_k\partial_{x_i} x_l\partial_{x_j} \right)S(t,\x)\Big).
\end{align}


%In the following Subsections we, first, analyze Eq.~(\ref{eq:HJB}) in the two model cases, which are Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC) extensions of the Steady State Control (CSS) solutions  presented, respectively, in Section \ref{sec:swimmers-CSS} and Section \ref{sec:thermal-CSS}. Then, we discuss the network (multi-zone) temperature control version of Eq.~(\ref{eq:HJB}) in Section \ref{sec:network-SOC}.

%\misha{ ... to be continued ... probably splitting in two sections and discussing ``single"-particle version of each of the applications. These will be different in terms of how optimization over ${\bm u}$ is done: unconstrained and constrained in the swimmers and thermal control, respectively.}

\subsection{Swimmers SOC: short correlated large-scale flow}\label{sec:swimmers-SOC}

Assume that ${\bm u}$ is elongated with ${\bm r}$, i.e. ${\bm u}=u {\bm r}/r$, then, $C(u,r)=u^2+\beta r^q$.  Accounting for Eqs.~(\ref{eq:simple-swimmers},\ref{eq:KFP-swimmers})  we arrive at the following "simple swimmers" version of Eq.~(\ref{eq:HJB}) 
\begin{align} \nonumber 
-\partial_t S & =\beta r^q+\frac{r^{1-d}}{2}\partial_r r^{d-1}\left(D (d-1)r^2+\kappa\right)\partial_rS+J,\\ \label{eq:HJB-swimmers} J& = 
\min_{u}\left(u^2
+ u \partial_r S\right)=-\frac{1}{4}\left(\partial_r S\right)^2,
\end{align}
where the optimal control is, $u^*(t,r)=-\partial_r S(t,r)/2$. Assuming that $q=2$, function defining the final condition, $S_f(r)$, is quadratic in $r$, and thus 
looking for solution of Eq.~(\ref{eq:HJB-swimmers}) in the (quadratic in $r$) form, $S(t,r)=\varsigma(t)r^2+s(t)$, we arrive at the following system of equations:
\begin{align*}
    %\label{eq:varsigma} & 
    d \kappa \varsigma+ds/dt=0,\ %\\
    %\label{eq:s} & 
    (d^2+d-2)D \varsigma-\varsigma^2+\beta+d\varsigma/dt=0,
\end{align*}
which results in the following solution for $\varsigma(t)$:
\begin{align}
    \nonumber & \varsigma(t)=\frac{1}{2}\Bigg(D(d+2)(d-1)+\sqrt{4\beta+D^2(d+2)^2(d-1)^2}\\ \label{eq:varsigma-sol} & *\tanh\left(\frac{(t_1-t)}{2}\sqrt{4\beta+D^2(d+2)^2(d-1)^2}\right)\Bigg),
    %\\
%    \nonumber %\label{eq:s-sol} 
%& s(t) =\frac{D\kappa(t_2-t)d(d+1)(d-1)}{2}\\ \nonumber & +d\kappa\log\left(\cosh\left(\frac{(t_1-t)}{2}\sqrt{4\beta+D^2(d+2)^2(d-1)^2}\right)\right),
\end{align}
where $t_1$ %and $t_2$ are 
is tuned to satisfy the final condition, $S(t_f,r)=S_f(r)$. We observe that $\varsigma(t)$, defined by Eq.~(\ref{eq:varsigma-sol}) and considered at the $t\to-\infty$ asymptotic, is fully consistent with Eq.~(\ref{eq:steady-swimmers-opt}) derived under assumption of the CSS control. 

\subsection{Thermal SOC} %: single zone}
\label{sec:thermal-SOC}

Formally, analysis of the single-zone version of the thermal SOC is very much similar to what was just described for the case of two swimmers.  It can also be considered as a special case of a multi-zone model, which we are therefore turning out attention with any further elaboration. 
\begin{comment}
In this case, $C(u,\theta)=(u-\underline{u})^2+\beta|\theta|^q$, and accounting for Eqs.~(\ref{eq:simple-thermal},\ref{eq:KFP-thermal}) we arrive at the following "simple thermal" version of Eq.~(\ref{eq:HJB}) 
\begin{align} \nonumber 
& -\partial_t S  =\beta|\theta|^q+\left(\kappa\partial^2_\theta +D\theta\partial_\theta \theta \partial_\theta \right)S -c_0\theta \partial_\theta S+J,
\\ \label{eq:HJB-thermal} &  J = 
\min_{\tilde{u}}\left(\tilde{u}^2
-\tilde{u} c_1\partial_\theta S\right)=-\frac{c_1^2}{4}\left(\partial_\theta S\right)^2,
\end{align}
where thus expression  for the optimal control is $u^*=c_1 \partial_\theta S(t,\theta)/2$.
Assuming that, $q=2$, $S_f(\theta)$ is quadratic in $\theta$ and thus looking for solution of Eq.~(\ref{eq:HJB-thermal}) also in the quadratic in $\theta$ form, $S(t,\theta)=\varsigma(t)\theta^2+s(t)$, we arrive at the following system of equations: 
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:1-thermal} & 2 \kappa \varsigma+ ds/dt=0,\\
    \label{eq:2-thermal} &  
    - c_0 \varsigma+4D \varsigma-c_1^2 \varsigma^2+\beta+d\varsigma/dt=0,
\end{align}
which results in the following solution:
\begin{align} \label{eq:varsigma-sol-thermal}
    \varsigma(t)  =c_1^{-2}\Big(2D-c_0+\sqrt{(2D-c_0)^2+\beta c_1^2}\\ \nonumber 
     *\tanh\Big((t_1-t)\sqrt{(2D-c_0)^2+\beta c_1^2}\Big)\Big),
\end{align}
where $t_1$ is a constant which needs to be tuned to satisfy $S(t_f,\theta)=S_f(\theta)$.
The resulting optimal control solution and its asymptotic form are
\begin{gather}
    \hspace{-0.2cm}  u^*\!=\! c_1\theta \varsigma(t)\Big|_{t\to -\infty}\!\!\! \to\text{right hand side of Eq.~(\ref{eq:phi*-thermo})}.
\end{gather}

\subsection{Thermal SOC: multi-zone network}
\label{sec:network-SOC}
\end{comment}
Adapting the HJB Eq.~(\ref{eq:HJB}) to the case of the multi-zone temperature control  and then generalizing the thermal CSS setting discussed in Section \ref{sec:thermal-CSS-multi}, we arrive at the following BHJ equation for the cost-to-go, $S(t,{\bm\theta})$
\begin{align}\label{eq:multi-zone-HJB} -\partial_t S  \!\!=\!\!\!\sum\limits_{i\in \V}\!\!\!\left(\beta_i|\theta_i|^q\!+\! D_{io} (\hat{l}_i^{(r)})^2S+\kappa_i\partial_{\theta_i}^2 S\!+\!J_i\right) \\ \nonumber 
+\sum\limits_{\{i,j\}\in \E}\!\!\!\! \hat{l}^{(r)}_{ij}\!\!\left(\underline{c}_{ij}\!+\! D_{ij}\hat{l}^{(r)}_{ij}\right) S,\\ \nonumber %\label{eq:Ji} 
\forall i:\ J_i \doteq\! \min\limits_{\tilde{u}}\left(\alpha_i\tilde{u}^2\!-\!\tilde{u} c_{is}(\underline{T}-T_s)\partial_{\theta_i}S\right)\\ \nonumber =-\frac{\gamma_i}{2} \left(\partial_{\theta_i} S\right)^2,\ \gamma_i\doteq \frac{c_{is}^2 (\underline{T}-T_s)^2}{2\alpha_i},
\end{align}
where $\hat{l}^{(r)}_i$ and $\hat{l}^{(r)}_{ij}$ are (time) conjugates of the operators $\hat{l}_{i}$ and $\hat{l}_{ij}$, respectively: $\hat{l}^{(r)}_{i}\doteq \theta_i\partial_{\theta_i}$ and 
$\hat{l}^{(r)}_{ij}\doteq (\theta_i-\theta_j)(\partial_{\theta_i}-\partial_{\theta_j})$. As in other HJB examples so far,  we are looking for the cost-to-go solving the multi-zone HJB Eq.~(\ref{eq:multi-zone-HJB}) correspondent to $q=2$ as a symmetric quadratic form in ${\bm \theta}$ with coefficients dependent on $t$: $S(t,{\bm \theta})=\sum_{i,j}\theta_i\varsigma_{ij}(t)\theta_j+s(t)$, where $\varsigma_{ij}=\varsigma_{ji}$. Substituting the quadratic ansatz in the Eq.~(\ref{eq:multi-zone-HJB}) we arrive at the system of generalized Ricatti equations (which we will not present here to save space). It is straightforward to check (as a sanity check) that at $\kappa=0$ and considered asymptotically at $t\to -\infty$, the system of equations is consistent with a solution of the KFP Eq.~(\ref{eq:KFP-multi}) at the optimal $\phi^{(*)}$. 
\begin{comment}
\begin{align}\nonumber 
\forall i:  \beta_i\!+\!\left(4\sum\limits_j (\underline{c}_{ij}\!+\! 3 D_{ij})\!+\!8D_{io}\!+\!\sum\limits_{j\neq }D_{jo}\right)\sigma_{ii}\!-\!\gamma_i(\varsigma_{ii})^2 \\ \label{eq:S-ansatz1}  -4\sum\limits_j (\underline{c}_{ij}\!+\!4D_{ij})\varsigma_{ij}\!+\!4\sum\limits_j D_{ij}\varsigma_{jj}\!+\!d\varsigma_{ii}/dt\!=\!0,

\section{Path Forward to Physics Informed Reinforcement Learning}\label{sec:path-to-RL}

Reinforcement Learning (RL) may be considered as a data-driven version of SOC \cite{sutton_reinforcement_2018}. It motivates our interest in applying RL to the multiplicative noise's setting(s) discussed insofar as the SOC. Indeed, consider Eqs.~(\ref{eq:SDE},\ref{eq:am}) as describing environment -- that is generating exogenous samples of the noise and then producing realizations of the state, ${\bm x}(t)$. Any new sample of ${\bm x}(t)$ becomes subject to an RL action, expressed via the control field, ${\bm u}(t)$. 

Therefore, we will focus in this Section on analysis of the RL approach and its juxtaposition to what follows (analytically and numerically) from SOC.

Our starting point will be to calibrate and check performance of some standard RL schemes (e.g. tabular or parameterized via neural networks) in achieving the goal of minimizing the cost (minus reward), associated with Eq.~(\ref{eq:steady-control}) or Eq.~(\ref{eq:dynamic-control}). We will work here with exactly the same additive and multiplicative noises as described in the preceeding Sections. Our primary goal here will be to check ability of the RL schemes to reproduce the results of the SOC analysis. Our hypothesis is that the most powerful schemes will return results comparable to these presented by SOC, however on the expense of significant computational efforts.

Second, we will include complications in noise and dynamics which cannot be analyzed efficiently by SOC but are accessible to a standard RL analysis. Here, and like above, we expect deriving strong results which are, however, expected at a high computational cost.

Third, and continuing to discuss difficult cases which are not amenable to a straightforward SOC analysis, we design a hybrid of SOC and RL, which will be coined Physics Informed Reinforcement Learning (PIRL). Specifically, we are splitting RL actions in two -- motivated by SOC and explored by brute-force RL component of PIRL. Learning of the PIRL model entails  co-learning of physical (thus explainable) parameters, which are embedded into the SOC-solution motivated part of the construction, and physics-blind, but performance improving, RL parameters (e.g. characterizing NNs describing correction to the SOC policy). 

\misha{ ... placeholder for some ... yet very vague thoughts/suggestions ... 


Applying ``standard" RL to both of our base cases 
and generalizations will be an interesting test for PIRL  based on SOC solutions discussed above ... generalizations will be especially rich in the case of swimmers where we will place swimmers in much more realistic (than analyzed with SOC) flows. Many unusual questions can be asked. For example, it may be interesting to answer the question if swimming not in the  direction of the passive swimmer but pointing a bit ahead to where the passive swimmer moves is advantageous? It seems that this question is beyond ability of the Batchelor-Kraichnan model, discussed above ... that is the hypothesis is that we will see advantage in swimming not directly at the passive swimmer only in a model with memory, when we learn statistics of the Lyapunov exponents as we go, that is on-the-fly.}
\end{comment}

\subsection{Conclusions and Path Forward (combined)}

%Analysis presented in Section \ref{sec:fat-tails} on two practical examples leads us to the following  conclusions and suggestions of the problems for future research:\\
We analyzed linear dynamic system, driven by additive and multiplicative noise of a general position,  which is stabilized by a linear feedback control. We have introduced an orthonormal basis of the time-ordered exponential of the multiplicative noise matrix, and showed that stationary statistics of the state vector projected to an element of the basis shows an algebraic tail. Exponent of the tail is presented as an explicit expression (\ref{eq:multi-general-tail}) which is bi-linear in the sum of the constant part of the system's dynamic vector with the linear feedback rate matrix and in the curvature at the minimum of the Cr\'{a}mer function of the element of the basis. We believe that it is of interest to extend the approach in the future to a data driven setting, where the Cr\'{a}mer functions of the Lyapunov exponents and respective eigen-vectors are learned from observations. 

Emergence of the fat tails in the linear systems driven by a multiplicative noise suggests using the newly introduced Mean-$q$-Power criterion for adjusting (to respective practical requirements) linear feedback control. We have illustrated that the criterion is useful for, and/or can be validated on, the approaches which are classic in control, specifically Control of Steady State (Section \ref{sec:CSS}) and Stochastic Optimal Control (Section \ref{sec:SOC}). We plan extending this approach to systems with partial observability and control-dependent noise. 

Our results are illustrated on and motivated by examples from hydrodynamics and civil engineering (thermostatic control in buildings). We envision extending this work to more complex fluid flows and "white box" modeling of the thermostatically control multi-zone buildings, by means of designing data driven reinforcement learning approaches improving the control schemes described in this letter \footnote{The author is grateful to L. Pagnier, R. Ferrando, C. Koh, S Konkimalla and A. Larsen for multiple discussions.  This work is a part of the team collaboration.}.

\begin{comment}
a multiplicative noise of a general position,  resulting in a well defined Cr\'{a}mer function, dynamic system 
 $P_{st}(|{\bm x}-\mathbb{E}[{\bm x}]|)$, 
 
 when it is well defined, is fully described by an equivalent white-Gaussian model with the covariance equal to the inverse of the Cr\'{a}mer function curvature at the minimum. This conclusion justifies validity of the CCS approach discussed in Section \ref{sec:CSS} and of the Optimal Stochastic Control approach yet to be discussed in the following Section \ref{sec:SOC}.\\
$\bullet$ Changing ${\bm \phi}$ --- that is vector of parameters in the linear feedback control -- results, according to Eqs.~(\ref{eq:swim-general-statistics},\ref{eq:multi-general-tail}), in the change of the tail of the stationary probability function of the norm of the state vector. Moreover, the respective algebraic exponent can be evaluated explicitly. We believe that this conclusion has a significant practical potential in the data driven control -- as it suggests in the case of the model uncertainty to focus on learning the curvature of the Cr\'{a}mer function at its minimum and normalized eigen-vector  associated with the largest Lyapunov exponent of the auxiliary system, driven solely by the multiplicative noise.\\
$\bullet$ 

\end{comment}

%The fat tail analysis justifies the use of the M$q$P stability. And vice versa, to verify that a linear feedback control is M$q$P stable one simply need to analyze the fat tail asymptotic -- just as described above in the two preceding Subsections on the examples.

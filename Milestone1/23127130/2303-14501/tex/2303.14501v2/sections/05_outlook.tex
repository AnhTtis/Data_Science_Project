In this work, we propose the simple yet effective Graph Attentive Vectors (GAV) link prediction framework. GAV relies on the idea of modeling simplified physical flow by updating vector embeddings in a constrained manner, which intuitively models the underlying physical process and, therefore, presents a strong inductive bias for link prediction in flow-driven spatial networks. This allows GAV to outperform the previous state-of-the-art by an impressive margin on all metrics across multiple whole-brain vessel and road network datasets while requiring a significantly smaller amount of trainable parameters.
GAV's imitation of the dynamics of physical flow, however, represents a simplified concept, which is not entirely representative of physical principles from, \eg, fluid dynamics (see Fig.~\ref{fig:inter}). Future work should, therefore, aim to further investigate GAV's parameters and extend its assumptions by incorporating different physical principles, such as conservation of mass and momentum, resulting in vector embeddings highly representative of physical flow in flow-driven spatial networks.

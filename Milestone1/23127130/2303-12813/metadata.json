    "abstract": "Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) is an increasingly recognized yet incompletely understood public health concern. Several studies have examined various ways to phenotype PASC to better characterize this heterogeneous condition. However, many gaps in PASC phenotyping research exist, including a lack of the following: 1) standardized definitions for PASC based on symptomatology; 2) generalizable and reproducible phenotyping heuristics and meta-heuristics; and 3) phenotypes based on both COVID-19 severity and symptom duration. In this study, we defined computable phenotypes (or heuristics) and meta-heuristics for PASC phenotypes based on COVID-19 severity and symptom duration. We also developed a symptom profile for PASC based on a common data standard. We identified four phenotypes based on COVID-19 severity (mild vs. moderate/severe) and duration of PASC symptoms (subacute vs. chronic). The symptoms groups with the highest frequency among phenotypes were cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric with each phenotype characterized by a different set of symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder with a significant prevalence. However, there is still no adequate technological support to enable epilepsy detection and continuous outpatient monitoring in everyday life. Hyperdimensional (HD) computing is an interesting alternative for wearable devices, characterized by a much simpler learning process and also lower memory requirements. In this work, we demonstrate a few additional aspects in which HD computing, and the way its models are built and stored, can be used for further understanding, comparing, and creating more advanced machine learning models for epilepsy detection. These possibilities are not feasible with other state-of-the-art models, such as random forests or neural networks. We compare inter-subject similarity of models per different classes (seizure and non-seizure), then study the process of creation of generalized models from personalized ones, and in the end, how to combine personalized and generalized models to create hybrid models. This results in improved epilepsy detection performance. We also tested knowledge transfer between models created on two different datasets. Finally, all those examples could be highly interesting not only from an engineering perspective to create better models for wearables, but also from a neurological perspective to better understand individual epilepsy patterns.",

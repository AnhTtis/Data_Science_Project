\section{Additional Results of Model Diagnosis}

\subsection{Additional counterfactual images}
Fig.~\ref{fig:appendix_classifier_single} shows more examples of single-attribute counterfactual images on the Cat/Dog and Perceived Gender classifiers. The output prediction is shown in the top-right corner. It shows that the model prediction is flipped without changing the actual target attribute. In addition to binary classification and key-point detection in our manuscript, we further illustrate the extension of \ourmodel counterfactuals on semantic segmentation, multi-class classification, and binary church classifier (BCC) in Fig.~\ref{fig:more_models}. Fig.~\ref{fig:appendix_classifier_multi} shows more examples of multiple-attribute counterfactual images.

\subsection{Additional histograms}
Fig.~\ref{fig:apendix_histograms} shows more histograms on the classifiers trained on CelebA (top) and the classifiers that are intentionally biased  (bottom). The models and datasets are created using the same method described in Section 4 of the main text.

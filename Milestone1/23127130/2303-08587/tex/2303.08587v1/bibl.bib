    abstract="Reliable uncertainty estimates of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are significant for safety-critical domains. Existing Neural Stochastic Differential Equation model (SDE-Net) can quantify epistemic uncertainties of DNNs from the perspective of a dynamical system. The SDE-Net is dominated by its drift net with In-Distribution (ID) data to obtain good predictive accuracy, or dominated by its diffusion net with Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data to generate high diffusion for characterizing model uncertainty. However, the SDE-Net does not consider the local optimal problem caused by the high-dimensional parameter spaces of DNNs, which still leads to unstable prediction results. Therefore, we propose a curved SDE-Net (cSDE-Net) model which is implemented with a quadratic Bezier curve to discover high-accuracy and nearly constant loss paths between pretrained SDE-Net models. In the cSDE-Net, the optimization goal is transformed from the weights of DNNs to the parameters of Bezier curve. Experimental results show that, the proposed cSDE-Net model can not only provide more stable and reliable prediction results than ensembling of independent trained SDE-Net (iSDE-Net), but also be more effective for general situation, where aleatoric uncertainty is caused by ID data with noise or missing rate.",

    ABSTRACT = {Existing neural stochastic differential equation models, such as SDE-Net, can quantify the uncertainties of deep neural networks (DNNs) from a dynamical system perspective. SDE-Net is either dominated by its drift net with in-distribution (ID) data to achieve good predictive accuracy, or dominated by its diffusion net with out-of-distribution (OOD) data to generate high diffusion for characterizing model uncertainty. However, it does not consider the general situation in a wider field, such as ID data with noise or high missing rates in practice. In order to effectively deal with noisy ID data for credible uncertainty estimation, we propose a vNPs-SDE model, which firstly applies variants of neural processes (NPs) to deal with the noisy ID data, following which the completed ID data can be processed more effectively by SDE-Net. Experimental results show that the proposed vNPs-SDE model can be implemented with convolutional conditional neural processes (ConvCNPs), which have the property of translation equivariance, and can effectively handle the ID data with missing rates for one-dimensional (1D) regression and two-dimensional (2D) image classification tasks. Alternatively, vNPs-SDE can be implemented with conditional neural processes (CNPs) or attentive neural processes (ANPs), which have the property of permutation invariance, and exceeds vanilla SDE-Net in multidimensional regression tasks.},

    "abstract": "We address the problem of motion planning for four-way intersection crossings\nwith right-of-ways. Road safety typically assigns liability to the follower in\nrear-end collisions and to the approaching vehicle required to yield in side\ncrashes. As an alternative to previous models based on heuristic state\nmachines, we propose a planning framework which changes the prediction model of\nother cars (e.g. their prototypical accelerations and decelerations) depending\non the given longitudinal or lateral priority rules. Combined with a\nstate-of-the-art trajectory optimization approach ROPT (Risk Optimization\nMethod) this allows to find ego velocity profiles minimizing risks from curves\nand all involved vehicles while maximizing utility (needed time to arrive at a\ngoal) and comfort (change and duration of acceleration) under the presence of\nregulatory conditions. Analytical and statistical evaluations show that our\nmethod is able to follow right-of-ways for a wide range of other vehicle\nbehaviors and path geometries. Even when the other cars drive in a\nnon-priority-compliant way, ROPT achieves good risk-comfort tradeoffs.",

    "abstract": "A combination of deep reinforcement learning and supervised learning is proposed for the problem of active sequential hypothesis testing in completely unknown environments. We make no assumptions about the prior probability, the action and observation sets, and the observation generating process. Our method can be used in any environment even if it has continuous observations or actions, and performs competitively and sometimes better than the Chernoff test, in both finite and infinite horizon problems, despite not having access to the environment dynamics.",

    "abstract": "We establish a link between vorticity wave interaction and $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking in shear flow instabilities. The minimal dynamical system for coupled counterpropagating vorticity waves is shown to be a non-Hermitian system with a saddle-node exceptional point. Vorticity wave dynamics of the system are then linked to the bifurcation of fixed points through the exceptional point and the Krein collision between eigenmodes with opposite Krein signatures. In the vicinity of the exceptional point, the transition of phase dynamics from a phase-slip state to a phase-locking state corresponds to spontaneous $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking and the onset of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. The phase-slip dynamics lead to non-modal, transient growth of perturbations, and the phase-slip frequency $Ω\\propto |k-k_c|^{1/2}$ shares the same critical exponent with the phase rigidity of system eigenvectors. The results can be readily extended to the interaction of multiple vorticity waves with multiple exceptional points and rich transient dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Jet measurements in heavy ion collisions can provide constraints on the properties of the quark gluon plasma, but the kinematic reach is limited by a large, fluctuating background. We present a novel application of symbolic regression to extract a functional representation of a deep neural network trained to subtract the background for measurements of jets in relativistic heavy ion collisions. We show that the deep neural network is approximately the same as a method using the particle multiplicity in a jet. This demonstrates that interpretable machine learning methods can provide insight into underlying physical processes.",

    "abstract": "Existence of symmetric objects, whose observation at different viewpoints can\nbe identical, can deteriorate the performance of simultaneous localization and\nmapping(SLAM). This work proposes a system for robustly optimizing the pose of\ncameras and objects even in the presence of symmetric objects. We classify\nobjects into three categories depending on their symmetry characteristics,\nwhich is efficient and effective in that it allows to deal with general objects\nand the objects in the same category can be associated with the same type of\nambiguity. Then we extract only the unambiguous parameters corresponding to\neach category and use them in data association and joint optimization of the\ncamera and object pose. The proposed approach provides significant robustness\nto the SLAM performance by removing the ambiguous parameters and utilizing as\nmuch useful geometric information as possible. Comparison with baseline\nalgorithms confirms the superior performance of the proposed system in terms of\nobject tracking and pose estimation, even in challenging scenarios where the\nbaseline fails.",

    "abstract": "This article explores the calculation of non-perturbative parameters present in the matrix element of semileptonic inclusive $B$ decay. These are important for inclusive determination of the Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) parameters in the standard model. We focus on calculating the rate for radiative inclusive decay, $B\\to X_u\\ell ν_{\\ell}γ$, where $γ$ is hard. By comparing both the radiative and non-radiative ($B\\to X_u \\ell ν_{\\ell}$) modes are found to require the same non-perturbative parameters. We propose forming ratios, $R_1$ and $R_2$, from $B\\to X_u \\ell ν_{\\ell}γ$ and $B\\to X_u \\ell ν_{\\ell}$ widths in different lepton energy ranges respectively. Our results provide an efficient way to unambiguously calculate the non-perturbative parameters, especially when combined with total width calculations of $B\\to X_u \\ell ν_{\\ell}$. This is in heavy quark expansion shown explicitly by working to $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{m_b})$ and determining $λ_1$ and $λ_2$.",

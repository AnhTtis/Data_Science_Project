\section{Expert Feedback}

To further validate our workflow’s usability, we conducted an informal interview with experts in social network studies. 
The first expert (E1) is a distinguished researcher in an institute of sociology who collected Datasets I and II and also conducted research on these datasets with different focuses from ours. 
The second expert (E2) is an assistant professor in a department of sociology who formulated the guidelines for collecting the datasets.
The other three experts are researchers in institutes of sociology (E3) and statistical science (E4, E5) who also studied the same datasets.
The interview was conducted through a video conference setup, where the preliminary versions of the three case studies were presented. 

All the experts agreed that our workflow can support a wide range of their analysis targets as well as derive insights with more intuitive interpretations when compared to their current approach.
For example, E1 commented, ``The results [seen in the composite variables] are much easier to understand and intuitive than the outputs from the statistical models used in our previous research.''
All of them showed strong interest in insights that can be derived from the signed weights in composite variables. 
% We presented some of such insights in the case studies. 
On the other hand, E1 noted a potential limitation of the datasets and analyses: ``The distribution of the respondents might affect the results related to the internet addiction because the students who granted the use of their data tended to be more addicted to the internet usage than others.''
E2 suggested better input attributes for the analyses, and we improved our case studies, accordingly.   

There are several discussions on our workflow usage and design.
E3 asked, ``What if there are attributes with a dominant influence on the result? What if the 1D representation does not have clear separation?'' 
For the former, the visualization shown in \autoref{fig:ui}-a can be used to identify dominant attributes and exclude them from inputs if such attributes exist.
Similarly, for the latter case, the visualization shown in \autoref{fig:ui}-b1 is useful to review the quality of the separation.
Then, based on the quality, analysts can take actions, such as adding more input attributes, reducing the ranges of the two ends of the output attribute, and improving the NN model.
E4 raised a question on our post-hoc simplification of network representations: ``Why not only use a neural network by designing the last layer with a linear activation function, instead of using LDA?''
Our answer is given in \autoref{sec:repr_simplification}. 
E5 asked, ``Why not use other centralities but these three?''
We selected degree, eigenvector, and betweenness centralities as a set of the most fundamental measures of structural characteristics.
Our workflow is flexible to employ any other centralities based on analysts' interests.

\begin{IEEEbiography}[{\includegraphics[width=1in,height=1.25in,clip,keepaspectratio]{photos/Yang-Chih_Fu.jpg}}]{Yang-chih Fu} is a Distinguished Research Fellow at the Institute of Sociology, Academia Sinica, Taiwan. He received the Ph.D. in Sociology from the University of Chicago. His recent research, which involves collecting contact records on social media and self-reported contact diaries from diverse participant groups, examines how social outcomes vary at the network, individual, tie, and contact levels. The findings and interpretations from these contact-based personal network studies have primarily been published in the journal Social Networks. Prof. Fu was awarded the Karl Polanyi Prize for his collaborative research comparing contact networks between Taiwan and Hungary.

\begin{IEEEbiography}[{\includegraphics[width=1in,height=1.25in,clip,keepaspectratio]{photos/Ander+Ynnerman.jpg}}]{Anders Ynnerman} received a Ph.D. 1992 in physics from Gothenburg University. During the early 90’s he was doing research at Oxford University, UK, and Vanderbilt University, USA. In 1996 he started the Swedish National Graduate School in Scientific Computing, which he directed until 1999. From 1997 to 2002 he directed the Swedish National Supercomputer Centre and from 2002 to 2006 he directed the Swedish National Infrastructure for Computing (SNIC). Since 1999 he is holding a chair in scientific visualization at Linkoping University and he is the director of the Norrkoping Visualization Center--C, which currently constitutes one of the main focal points for research and education in computer graphics and visualization in the Nordic region. The center also hosts a public arena with large scale visualization facilities. He is also one of the co-founders of the Center for Medical Image Science and Visualization (CMIV).

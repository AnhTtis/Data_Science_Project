\section{Conclusion}

We have introduced a new visual analytics workflow designed to help find associations from complex multivariate networks.
The workflow integrates neural-network-based representation learning,  composite variable construction, and interactive visualizations.
Benefiting from these components, the workflow generates expressive as well as interpretable analytical results. 
The design of workflow is also suited for analyzing other simpler types of data, such as a univariate network and high-dimensional data.
Thus, our work potentially contributes to a wide range of applications that involve analyses of large, complex data.

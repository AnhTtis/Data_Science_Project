    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based optimization algorithm to achieve better undersampling rate for multiple measurement vector (MMV) problem. The core is to introduce the $\\ell_{2,0}$-norm sparsity constraint to describe the joint-sparsity of the MMV problem, which is different from the widely used $\\ell_{2,1}$-norm constraint in the existing research. In order to illustrate the better performance of $\\ell_{2,0}$-norm, first this paper proves the equivalence of the sparsity of the row support set of a matrix and its $\\ell_{2,0}$-norm. Afterward, the MMV problem based on $\\ell_{2,0}$-norm is proposed. Moreover, building on the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz property, this paper establishes that the sequence generated by ADMM globally converges to the optimal point of the MMV problem. Finally, the performance of our algorithm and comparison with other algorithms under different conditions is studied by simulated examples.",

The relaxation is shown to be determined by three processes: (i) the precession of the electron spin in the hyperfine field of the frozen fluctuation of the nuclear spins; (ii) the precession of the nuclear spins in the hyperfine field of the electron; and (iii) the precession of the nuclear spin in the dipole field of its nuclear neighbors. In external magnetic fields the relaxation of electron spins directed along the magnetic field is suppressed. Electron spins directed transverse to the magnetic field relax completely in a time on the order of the precession period of its spin in the field of the frozen fluctuation of the nuclear spins. Comparison with experiment shows that the hyperfine interaction with nuclei may be the dominant mechanism of electron spin relaxation in quantum dots.},

An important feature of the model is that the coupling to an individual nuclear spin depends on its position in the quantum dot. We introduce a semiclassical description of the system valid in the limit of a large number of nuclei and analyze the resulting classical dynamics. Contrary to a natural assumption of chaoticity of such dynamics, the correlation functions of the electron spin with an arbitrary initial condition show no decay in time. Rather, they exhibit complicated undamped oscillations. This may be attributed to the fact that the system has many integrals of motion and is close to an integrable one. The correlation functions averaged over initial conditions do exhibit a slow decay ($\sim1/ln(t)$ at $t\to\infty$).},

  Abstract                 = {We have performed a systematic calculation for the non-Markovian dynamics of a localized electron spin interacting with an environment of nuclear spins via the Fermi contact hyperfine interaction. This work applies to an electron in the s-type orbital ground state of a quantum dot or bound to a donor impurity, and is valid for arbitrary polarization p of the nuclear spin system, and arbitrary nuclear spin I in high magnetic fields. In the limit of p = 1 and I = (1/2), the Born approximation of our perturbative theory recovers the exact electron spin dynamics. We have found the form of the generalized master equation (GME) for the longitudinal and transverse components of the electron spin to all orders in the electron spin-nuclear spin flip-flop terms. Our perturbative expansion is regular, unlike standard time-dependent perturbation theory, and can be carried out to higher orders. We show this explicitly with a fourth-order calculation of the longitudinal spin dynamics. In zero magnetic field, the fraction of the electron spin that decays is bounded by the smallness parameter $\delta= 1/(p^2N)$, where N is the number of nuclear spins within the extent of the electron wave function. However, the form of the decay can only be determined in a high magnetic field, much larger than the maximum Overhauser field. In general the electron spin shows rich dynamics, described by a sum of contributions with nonexponential decay, exponential decay, and undamped oscillations. There is an abrupt crossover in the electron spin asymptotics at a critical dimensionality and shape of the electron envelope wave function. We propose a scheme that could be used to measure the non-Markovian dynamics using a standard spin-echo technique, even when the fraction that undergoes non-Markovian dynamics is small.},

A mathematical framework simultaneously describing coupling to the slow mesoscopic bath and a Markovian environment is developed and the dephasing and decoherence properties of the total system are investigated. The model is applied to several specific examples with direct relevance to current experiments. Comparisons to experiments suggests that such quasi-static degrees of freedom play an important role in current qubit implementations.

In particular, we identify an electron-spin correlation function that fully represents the electron-spin quantum coherence. Using the EOM method, we recover the exact solution of electron-spin decoherence for the case of a fully polarized nuclear reservoir. By considering nuclear-spin flip-flops mediated by virtual electron flips, which generate fluctuations in the Overhauser field (the nuclear field) for the electron spin, we find that the free-induction decay of the electron-spin correlation function for partially polarized and unpolarized nuclear-spin configurations is of the order unity instead of O(1/N) (N being the number of nuclei in the dot) obtained in previous studies. We show that the complete amplitude decay corresponds to the spectral broadening of the correlation function near the electron-spin Rabi frequency induced by nuclear-spin flip-flops. Our results show that a 90\% nuclear-spin polarization can enhance the electron-spin coherence time by more than 1 order of magnitude. In the long-time limit, the envelope of the transverse electron-spin correlation function has a nonexponential 1/t2 decay in the presence of both polarized and unpolarized nuclei.},

The electron spin dephasing due to this random magnetic field depends intricately on the quantum dynamics of the nuclear spin bath, making the coupled decoherence problem difficult to solve. We provide a formally exact solution of this non-Markovian quantum decoherence problem which numerically calculates accurate spin decoherence at short times, which is of particular relevance in solid-state spin quantum computer architectures. A quantum cluster expansion method is developed, motivated, and tested for the problem of localized electron spin decoherence due to dipolar fluctuations of lattice nuclear spins. The method is presented with enough generality for possible application to other types of spin decoherence problems. We present numerical results which are in quantitative agreement with electron spin echo measurements in phosphorus doped silicon. We also present spin echo decay results for quantum dots in GaAs which differ qualitatively from that of the phosphorus doped silicon system. Our theoretical results provide the ultimate limit on the spin coherence (at least, as characterized by Hahn spin echo measurements) of localized electrons in semiconductors in the low temperature and the moderate to high magnetic field regime of interest in scalable semiconductor quantum computer architectures.},

By using only analytical methods, we are able to show how the interaction strength depends on important physical parameters, such as curvature and isotope abundances. We show that for the investigated carbon structures, the 13C hyperfine coupling strength is less than 1 mu-eV, and that the associated electron-spin decoherence time can be expected to be several tens of microseconds or longer, depending on the abundance of spin-carrying 13C nuclei.

We calculate the dynamics of an electron spin surrounded by a bath of nuclear spins in a non-Markovian approach using a generalized master equation. Considering a general form of the hyperfine interaction, we are able to extend the range of validity of our results to other systems beyond graphene. For large external magnetic fields, we find within Born approximation that the electron spin state is conserved up to small corrections, which oscillate with a frequency determined by the hyperfine interaction. The amplitude of these oscillations decays with a power law, where its initial value depends on the specific form of the anisotropy. Analyzing this in more detail, we identify two distinct classes of anisotropy, which can be both found in graphene depending on the orientation of the external magnetic field with respect to the carbon layer.},

In particular, spin-based quantum computing in gallium arsenide takes advantage of the high quality of semiconducting materials, reliability in fabricating arrays of quantum dots, and accurate qubit operations. However, the effective magnetic noise arising from the hyperfine interaction with uncontrolled nuclear spins in the host lattice constitutes a major source of decoherence. Low frequency nuclear noise, responsible for fast (10 ns) inhomogeneous dephasing, can be removed by echo techniques. High frequency nuclear noise, recently studied via echo revivals, occurs in narrow frequency bands related to differences in Larmor precession of the three isotopes 69Ga, 71Ga, and 75As. Here we show that both low and high frequency nuclear noise can be filtered by appropriate dynamical decoupling sequences, resulting in a substantial enhancement of spin qubit coherence times. Using nuclear notch filtering, we demonstrate a spin coherence time (T2) of 0.87 ms, five orders of magnitude longer than inhomogeneous dephasing.},

  Abstract                 = {The spin of an electron or a nucleus in a semiconductor [1] naturally implements the unit of quantum information -- the qubit -- while providing a technological link to the established electronics industry [2]. The solid-state environment, however, may provide deleterious interactions between the qubit and the nuclear spins of surrounding atoms [3], or charge and spin fluctuators in defects, oxides and interfaces [4]. For group IV materials such as silicon, enrichment of the spin-zero 28-Si isotope drastically reduces spin-bath decoherence [5]. Experiments on bulk spin ensembles in 28-Si crystals have indeed demonstrated extraordinary coherence times [6-8]. However, it remained unclear whether these would persist at the single-spin level, in gated nanostructures near amorphous interfaces. Here we present the coherent operation of individual 31-P electron and nuclear spin qubits in a top-gated nanostructure, fabricated on an isotopically engineered 28-Si substrate. We report new benchmarks for coherence time (> 30 seconds) and control fidelity (> 99.99\%) of any single qubit in solid state, and perform a detailed noise spectroscopy [9] to demonstrate that -- contrary to widespread belief -- the coherence is not limited by the proximity to an interface. Our results represent a fundamental advance in control and understanding of spin qubits in nanostructures.},

  Abstract                 = {Solid-state spin systems such as nitrogen-vacancy colour centres in diamond are promising for applications of quantum information, sensing and metrology. However, a key challenge for such solid-state systems is to realize a spin coherence time that is much longer than the time for quantum spin manipulation protocols. Here we demonstrate an improvement of more than two orders of magnitude in the spin coherence time (T2) of nitrogen-vacancy centres compared with previous measurements: T2≈0.6 s at 77 K. We employed dynamical decoupling pulse sequences to suppress nitrogen-vacancy spin decoherence, and found that T2 is limited to approximately half of the longitudinal spin relaxation time over a wide range of temperatures, which we attribute to phonon-induced decoherence. Our results apply to ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy spins, and thus could advance quantum sensing, enable squeezing and many-body entanglement, and open a path to simulating driven, interaction-dominated quantum many-body Hamiltonians.},

	abstract = {We review and summarize recent theoretical and experimental work on electron spin dynamics in quantum dots and related nanostructures due to hyperfine interaction with surrounding nuclear spins. This topic is of particular interest with respect to several proposals for quantum information processing in solid state systems. Specifically, we investigate the hyperfine interaction of an electron spin confined in a quantum dot in an s-type conduction band with the nuclear spins in the dot. This interaction is proportional to the square modulus of the electron wavefunction at the location of each nucleus leading to an inhomogeneous coupling, i.e. nuclei in different locations are coupled with different strengths. In the case of an initially fully polarized nuclear spin system an exact analytical solution for the spin dynamics can be found. For not completely polarized nuclei, approximation-free results can only be obtained numerically in sufficiently small systems. We compare these exact results with findings from several approximation strategies.}

After a discussion of the theoretical background, I report the essentials of a number of case studies selected to show the potentialities and limits of local and gradient corrected density functionals in dealing with structural, spectroscopic, thermochemical and kinetic aspects. At the same time I introduce self-consistent hybrid methods obtained by adding some Hartree–Fock exchange to gradient-corrected functionals. The results obtained at this level for a number of properties are competitive with the most sophisticated post-Hartree–Fock approaches. The speed of the computations and the availability of analytical first and second derivatives allow the complete characterization of stationary points and the analysis of significant regions of potential energy surfaces for systems much larger than those which can be dealt with by conventional ab-initio methods. This paves the route toward the study of large amplitude motions, from conformational transitions to true chemical reactions. },

The basis functions and the electron density are projected on a real-space grid, in order to calculate the Hartree and  exchange-correlation  potentials and matrix elements, with a number of operations that scales linearly with the size of the system. We use a modified energy functional, whose minimization produces orthogonal wavefunctions and the same energy and density  as the Kohn-Sham energy functional, without the need for an explicit orthogonalization. Additionally, using localized Wannier-like electron wavefunctions   allows the computation time and memory required to minimize  the energy to also scale linearly with the size of the system. Forces and stresses are also calculated efficiently and accurately,  thus allowing structural relaxation and molecular dynamics simulations.}

abstract={Publisher Summary This chapter is concerned with spin-resonance absorption---that is, power absorption from an oscillating magnetic field---by conduction electrons. The e place of spin resonance in investigations of the band structure contrasts the cases of paramagnetic salts and conductors. In the former, the levels of the ions are discrete; when they have an odd number of electrons each level is at least twofold degenerate. An external magnetic field splits this degeneracy. The microwave spectroscopy of the energy bands is not confined to spin resonance, but includes cyclotron resonance. Of the two, undoubtedly the latter provides the most direct information on the energy bands. Spin resonance does not play the central role that it does in paramagnetic salts. However, it usually plays a useful supplementary role when something about the band structure is known, serving either as a check on the band model or determining the values of additional parameters. The use of spin resonance in semiconductors and semimetals grow as better materials are made and detailed knowledge about their band structure becomes available.},

abstract={The chemical versatility of carbon imparts manifold properties to organic compounds, where magnetism remains one of the most desirable but elusive1. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, also referred to as nanographenes, show a critical dependence of electronic structure on the topologies of the edges and the $\pi$-electron network, which makes them model systems with which to engineer unconventional properties including magnetism. In 1972, Erich Clar envisioned a bow-tie-shaped nanographene, C38H18 (refs. 2,3), where topological frustration in the $\pi$-electron network renders it impossible to assign a classical Kekul{\'e} structure without leaving unpaired electrons, driving the system into a magnetically non-trivial ground state4. Here, we report the experimental realization and in-depth characterization of this emblematic nanographene, known as Clar's goblet. Scanning tunnelling microscopy and spin excitation spectroscopy of individual molecules on a gold surface reveal a robust antiferromagnetic order with an exchange-coupling strength of 23{\thinspace}meV, exceeding the Landauer limit of minimum energy dissipation at room temperature5. Through atomic manipulation, we realize switching of magnetic ground states in molecules with quenched spins. Our results provide direct evidence of carbon magnetism in a hitherto unrealized class of nanographenes6, and prove a long-predicted paradigm where topological frustration entails unconventional magnetism, with implications for room-temperature carbon-based spintronics7,8.},

abstract={Nanographenes with zigzag edges are predicted to manifest non-trivial $\pi$-magnetism resulting from the interplay of concurrent electronic effects, such as hybridization of localized frontier states and Coulomb repulsion between valence electrons. This provides a chemically tunable platform to explore quantum magnetism at the nanoscale and opens avenues towards organic spintronics. The magnetic stability in nanographenes is thus far greatly limited by the weak magnetic exchange coupling, which remains below the room-temperature thermal energy. Here, we report the synthesis of large rhombus-shaped nanographenes with zigzag peripheries on gold and copper surfaces. Single-molecule scanning probe measurements show an emergent magnetic spin singlet ground state with increasing nanographene size. The magnetic exchange coupling in the largest nanographene (C70H22, containing five benzenoid rings along each edge), determined by inelastic electron tunnelling spectroscopy, exceeds 100{\thinspace}meV or 1,160{\thinspace}K, which outclasses most inorganic nanomaterials and survives on a metal electrode.},

A prerequisite for their emergence is the existence of robust gapped phases, which are difficult to find in extended graphene systems. Here we show that semi-metallic chiral GNRs (chGNRs) narrowed down to nanometer widths undergo a topological phase transition. We fabricated atomically precise chGNRs of different chirality and size by on surface synthesis using predesigned molecular precursors. Combining scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements and theory simulations, we follow the evolution of topological properties and bulk band gap depending on the width, length, and chirality of chGNRs. Our findings represent a new platform for producing topologically protected spin states and demonstrate the potential of connecting chiral edge and defect structure with band engineering.},

abstract={Turning graphene magnetic is a promising challenge to make it an active material for spintronics. Predictions state that graphene structures with specific shapes can spontaneously develop magnetism driven by Coulomb repulsion of $\pi$-electrons, but its experimental verification is demanding. Here, we report on the observation and manipulation of individual magnetic moments in graphene open-shell nanostructures on a gold surface. Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we detect the presence of single electron spins localized around certain zigzag sites of the carbon backbone via the Kondo effect. We find near-by spins coupled into a singlet ground state and quantify their exchange interaction via singlet-triplet inelastic electron excitations. Theoretical simulations picture how electron correlations result in spin-polarized radical states with the experimentally observed spatial distributions. Extra hydrogen atoms bound to radical sites quench their magnetic moment and switch the spin of the nanostructure in half-integer amounts. Our work demonstrates the intrinsic $\pi$-paramagnetism of graphene nanostructures.},

abstract={Fractionalization is a phenomenon in which strong interactions in a quantum system drive the emergence of excitations with quantum numbers that are absent in the building blocks. Outstanding examples are excitations with charge e/3 in the fractional quantum Hall effect1,2, solitons in one-dimensional conducting polymers3,4 and Majorana states in topological superconductors5. Fractionalization is also predicted to manifest itself in low-dimensional quantum magnets, such as one-dimensional antiferromagnetic S{\thinspace}={\thinspace}1 chains. The fundamental features of this system are gapped excitations in the bulk6 and, remarkably, S{\thinspace}={\thinspace}1/2 edge states at the chain termini7--9, leading to a four-fold degenerate ground state that reflects the underlying symmetry-protected topological order10,11. Here, we use on-surface synthesis12 to fabricate one-dimensional spin chains that contain the S{\thinspace}={\thinspace}1 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon triangulene as the building block. Using scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy at 4.5{\thinspace}K, we probe length-dependent magnetic excitations at the atomic scale in both open-ended and cyclic spin chains, and directly observe gapped spin excitations and fractional edge states therein. Exact diagonalization calculations provide conclusive evidence that the spin chains are described by the S{\thinspace}={\thinspace}1 bilinear-biquadratic Hamiltonian in the Haldane symmetry-protected topological phase. Our results open a bottom-up approach to study strongly correlated phases in purely organic materials, with the potential for the realization of measurement-based quantum computation13.},

abstract  ="Graphene nanoribbons hold great promise for future applications in nanoelectronic devices{,} as they may combine the excellent electronic properties of graphene with the opening of an electronic band gap – not present in graphene but required for transistor applications. With a two-step on-surface synthesis process{,} graphene nanoribbons can be fabricated with atomic precision{,} allowing precise control over width and edge structure. Meanwhile{,} a decade of research has resulted in a plethora of graphene nanoribbons having various structural and electronic properties. This article reviews not only the on-surface synthesis of atomically precise graphene nanoribbons but also how their electronic properties are ultimately linked to their structure. Current knowledge and considerations with respect to precursor design{,} which eventually determines the final (electronic) structure{,} are summarized. Special attention is dedicated to the electronic properties of graphene nanoribbons{,} also in dependence on their width and edge structure. It is exactly this possibility of precisely changing their properties by fine-tuning the precursor design – offering tunability over a wide range – which has generated this vast research interest{,} also in view of future applications. Thus{,} selected device prototypes are presented as well."}

With a scanning tunneling microscope tip, Willke et al. measured these hyperfine interactions for iron and titanium atoms that were manipulated on a magnesium oxide surface. The tip was also used to measure electron paramagnetic resonance spectra. The hyperfine structure of single atoms was sensitive to the binding site of the atom as well as its position relative to other magnetic atoms. Science, this issue p. 336 Atom manipulation and spin sensing with scanning tunneling microscopy reveal details underlying hyperfine interactions. Taking advantage of nuclear spins for electronic structure analysis, magnetic resonance imaging, and quantum devices hinges on knowledge and control of the surrounding atomic-scale environment. We measured and manipulated the hyperfine interaction of individual iron and titanium atoms placed on a magnesium oxide surface by using spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy in combination with single-atom electron spin resonance. Using atom manipulation to move single atoms, we found that the hyperfine interaction strongly depended on the binding configuration of the atom. We could extract atom- and position-dependent information about the electronic ground state, the state mixing with neighboring atoms, and properties of the nuclear spin. Thus, the hyperfine spectrum becomes a powerful probe of the chemical environment of individual atoms and nanostructures.}}

We give a self-contained summary of the \{SW\} method with a focus on rigorous results. We begin with an exact definition of the \{SW\} transformation in terms of the so-called direct rotation between linear subspaces. From this we obtain elementary proofs of several important properties of H eff such as the linked cluster theorem. We then study the perturbative version of the \{SW\} transformation obtained from a Taylor series representation of the direct rotation. Our perturbative approach provides a systematic diagram technique for computing high-order corrections to H eff . We then specialize the \{SW\} method to quantum spin lattices with short-range interactions. We establish unitary equivalence between effective low-energy Hamiltonians obtained using two different versions of the \{SW\} method studied in the literature. Finally, we derive an upper bound on the precision up to which the ground state energy of the n th-order effective Hamiltonian approximates the exact ground state energy.},

We pay special attention to the effect of the dynamical nuclear spin polarization induced by the electronic current on the nuclear environment. We discuss the behaviour of the electronic current and the induced nuclear spin polarization versus an external magnetic field for different HF coupling intensities and interdot tunnelling strengths. We take into account, for each magnetic field, all HF-mediated spin-relaxation processes coming from different opposite spin level approaches. We find that the current as a function of the external magnetic field shows a peak or a dip and that the transition from a current dip to a current peak behaviour is obtained by decreasing the HF coupling or by increasing the interdot tunnelling strength. We give a physical picture in terms of the interplay between the electrons tunnelling out of the DQD and the spin-flip processes due to the nuclear environment.},

Although such experiments have become increasingly popular in recent years, interpretation of their results in terms of the underlying nuclear spin dynamics remains challenging. Here we examine nuclear polarization dynamics within a two-polarization model that supports a wide range of nonlinear phenomena. We point out a fundamental process in which nuclear spin dynamics can be driven by electron shot noise; fast electric current fluctuations generate much slower nuclear polarization dynamics, which in turn affect electron dynamics via the Overhauser field. The resulting intermittent, extremely slow current fluctuations account for a variety of observed phenomena that were not previously understood.},

Lett. 104 226807 (2010)], we identified three regimes of long-term dynamics, including the buildup of a large difference in the Overhauser fields across the dots, the saturation of the nuclear polarization process associated with the formation of so-called dark states, and the elimination of the difference field. In particular, when the dots are different sizes, we found that the Overhauser field becomes larger in the smaller dot. Here we present a detailed theoretical analysis of these problems, including a model of the polarization dynamics and the development of a numerical method to efficiently simulate semiclassical-central-spin problems. When nuclear spin noise is included, the results agree with our prior work indicating that large difference fields and dark states are stable configurations, while the elimination of the difference field is unstable; however, in the absence of noise, we find all three steady states are achieved depending on parameters.

  Abstract                 = {We theoretically investigate the controlled dynamic polarization of lattice nuclear spins in GaAs double quantum dots containing two electrons. Three regimes of long-term dynamics are identified, including the buildup of a large difference in the Overhauser fields across the dots, the saturation of the nuclear polarization process associated with formation of so-called "dark states", and the elimination of the difference field. We show that in the case of unequal dots, buildup of difference fields generally accompanies the nuclear polarization process, whereas for nearly identical dots, buildup of difference fields competes with polarization saturation in dark states. The elimination of the difference field does not, in general, correspond to a stable steady state of the polarization process.},

Realizing nuclear spin control would likely improve electron spin coherence and potentially enable the nuclear environment to be harnessed for the long-term storage of quantum information. Toward this goal, we report experimental control of the relaxation of nuclear spin polarization in a gate-defined two-electron GaAs double quantum dot. A cyclic gate-pulse sequence transfers the spin of an electron pair to the host nuclear system, establishing a local nuclear polarization that relaxes on a time scale of seconds. We find nuclear relaxation depends on magnetic field and gate-controlled two-electron exchange, consistent with a model of electron mediated nuclear spin diffusion.},

The theory incorporates the hyperfine interaction, the intrinsic (both direct and indirect) nuclear interactions, and the extrinsic nuclear coupling mediated by the hyperfine interaction with the single electron in question. The last is shown to be important in free-induction decay (FID) of the single electron spin coherence. The spin-echo eliminates the hyperfine-mediated decoherence but only reduces the decoherence by the intrinsic nuclear interactions. Thus, the decoherence times for single spin FID and ensemble spin-echo are significantly different. The decoherence is explained in terms of quantum entanglement, which involves more than the spectral diffusion.},

We drove the spin resonance with an oscillating electric field (20 to 30 gigahertz) between tip and sample. The readout of the Fe atoms quantum state was performed by spin-polarized detection of the atomic-scale tunneling magnetoresistance. We determine an energy relaxation time of T1 100 microseconds and a phase-coherence time of T2 210 nanoseconds. The spin resonance signals of different Fe atoms differ by much more than their resonance linewidth; in a traditional ensemble measurement, this difference would appear as inhomogeneous broadening.},

We develop a microscopic theory capable of calculating the exact time evolution of the strained electron-nuclear system. With this, we evaluate the operation of quantum state storage and show that fidelities up to 90% can be reached with a modest nuclear polarization of only 50%.

  Abstract                 = {We theoretically consider the possibility of using solid state nuclear spins in a semiconductor nanostructure environment as long-lived, high-fidelity quantum memory. In particular, we calculate, in the limit of a strong applied magnetic field, the fidelity of P donor nuclear spins as a function of time in random bath environments of Si and GaAs, and the lifetime of excited intrinsic spins in polarized Si and GaAs environments. In the former situation, the nuclear spin dephases due to spectral diffusion induced by the dipolar interaction among nuclei in the bath; in the interest of the high fidelity requirements necessary for fault-tolerant quantum computing, we consider the initial quantum memory decay caused by a non-Markovian bath. We calculate this nuclear spin memory time in the context of Hahn and Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) refocused spin echoes using a formally exact cluster expansion technique which has previously been successful in dealing with electron spin dephasing in a solid state nuclear spin bath. With decoherence dominated by transverse dephasing (T2), we find it feasible to maintain high fidelity (losses of less than $10^{-6}$) quantum memory on nuclear spins for times of the order of 100 $\mu$ s (GaAs:P) and 1 to 2 ms (natural Si:P) using CPMG pulse sequences of just a few (~2-4) applied pulses. We also consider the complementary situation of a central flipped intrinsic nuclear spin in a bath of completely polarized nuclear spins where decoherence is caused by the direct flip-flop of the central spin with spins in the bath. Exact numerical calculations that include a sufficiently large neighborhood of surrounding nuclei show lifetimes on the order of 1-5 ms for both GaAs and natural Si. Our calculated nuclear spin coherence times may have significance for solid state quantum computer architectures using localized electron spins in semiconductors where nuclear spins have been proposed for quantum memory storage.},

In both cases, we show that the system exhibits a subharmonic response in spin magnetizations in the presence of disorder for both pure Heisenberg and XXZ interactions.

Although quantum physics dictates the behaviour of nanoscale objects, quantum coherence, which is central to quantum information, communication and sensing, has not played an explicit role in much of nanoscience. This Review describes fundamental principles and practical applications of quantum coherence in nanoscale systems, a research area we call quantum-coherent nanoscience. We structure this Review according to specific degrees of freedom that can be quantum-coherently controlled in a given nanoscale system, such as charge, spin, mechanical motion and photons.

These states divide into two exponentially large classes: bright states, where the qubit is entangled with the bath, and dark states, where it is not. We discuss how dark states limit qubit-assisted spin bath polarization and provide a robust long-lived quantum memory for qubit states.},

Besides offering a means to probe some of the most peculiar and fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics, entanglement in many-body systems can be used as a tool to reduce fluctuations below the standard quantum limit. For spins, or spin-like systems, such a reduction of fluctuations can be realized with so-called squeezed states. Here we present a scheme for achieving coherent spin squeezing of nuclear spin states in few-electron quantum dots. This work represents a major shift from earlier studies in quantum dots, which have explored classical "narrowing" of the nuclear polarization distribution through feedback involving stochastic spin flips. In contrast, we use the nuclear-polarization-dependence of the electron spin resonance (ESR) to provide a non-linearity which generates a non-trivial, area-preserving, "twisting" dynamics that squeezes and stretches the nuclear spin Wigner distribution without the need for nuclear spin flips.},

The transition occurs when the strength of spin-orbit coupling exceeds the strength of the net hyperfine coupling and results in the complete suppression of nuclear spin pumping. Below the transition point, nuclear pumping is accompanied by a strong reduction in current due to the presence of nondecaying “dark states” in this regime. Due to its topological character, the transition is expected to be robust against dephasing of the electronic degrees of freedom.},

In the absence of a self-Hamiltonian we show that in this model (introduced some time ago to illustrate environment-induced superselection) generic assumptions about the coupling strengths can lead to a universal (Gaussian) suppression of coherence between pointer states. On the other hand, we show that when the dynamics of the central spin is dominant a different regime emerges, which is characterized by a non-Gaussian decay and a dramatically different set of pointer states. We explore the regimes of validity of the Gaussian decay and discuss its relation to the spectral features of the environment and to the Loschmidt echo (or fidelity).},

This environment, at low energies, maps onto a "spin bath" model. This contrasts with "oscillator bath" models (originated by Feynman and Vernon) which describe {\it delocalised} environmental modes such as electrons, phonons, photons, magnons, etc. One cannot in general map a spin bath to an oscillator bath (or vice-versa); they constitute distinct "universality classes" of quantum environment. We show how the mapping to spin bath models is made, and then discuss several examples in detail, including moving particles, magnetic solitons, nanomagnets, and SQUIDs, coupled to nuclear and paramagnetic spin environments. We show how to average over spin bath modes, using an operator instanton technique, to find the system dynamics, and give analytic results for the correlation functions, under various conditions. We then describe the application of this theory to magnetic and superconducting systems.Particular attention is given to recent work on tunneling magnetic macromolecules, where the role of the nuclear spin bath in controlling the tunneling is very clear; we also discuss other magnetic systems in the quantum regime, and the influence of nuclear and paramagnetic spins on flux dynamics in SQUIDs.},

The article begins with a brief discussion of Richardson’s early work, which demonstrated the exact solvability of the pure pairing model, and then shows how that work has evolved recently into a much richer class of exactly solvable models. The Richardson solution leads naturally to an exact analogy between these quantum models and classical electrostatic problems in two dimensions. This analogy is then used to demonstrate formally how BCS theory emerges as the large-N limit of the pure pairing Hamiltonian. Several applications to problems of relevance to condensed-matter physics, nuclear physics, and the physics of confined systems are considered. Some of the interesting effects that are discussed in the context of these exactly solvable models include (i) the crossover from superconductivity to a fluctuation-dominated regime in small metallic grains; (ii) the role of the nucleon Pauli principle in suppressing the effects of high-spin bosons in interacting boson models of nuclei, and (iii) the possibility of fragmentation in confined boson systems. Interesting insight is also provided into the origin of the superconducting phase transition both in two-dimensional electronic systems and in atomic nuclei, based on the electrostatic image of the corresponding exactly solvable quantum pairing models.},

Randall et al. used an array of nuclear spins surrounding a nitrogen vacancy center in diamond as their many-body quantum system. Subjecting the system to a series of periodic driving pulses, they observed ordering of the spins occurring at twice the driving frequency, a signature that they claim establishes the formation of a discrete time crystal. Such dynamic control is expected to be useful for manipulating quantum systems and implementing quantum information protocols. —ISO A programmable, spin-based quantum simulator was used to realize a many-body-localized discrete time crystal. The discrete time crystal (DTC) is a nonequilibrium phase of matter that spontaneously breaks time-translation symmetry. Disorder-induced many-body localization can stabilize the DTC phase by breaking ergodicity and preventing thermalization. Here, we observe the hallmark signatures of the many-body–localized DTC using a quantum simulation platform based on individually controllable carbon-13 nuclear spins in diamond. We demonstrate long-lived period-doubled oscillations and confirm that they are robust for generic initial states, thus showing the characteristic time-crystalline order across the many-body spectrum. Our results are consistent with the realization of an out-of-equilibrium Floquet phase of matter and introduce a programmable quantum simulator based on solid-state spins for exploring many-body physics.},

We then show that the superradiantlike evolution is robust to various extensions of the initial setup, and derive the minimum shuttling time which allows to escape adiabatic spin evolution. We also discuss slow/fast shuttling under the inhomogeneous field of a nearby micromagnet and compare our scheme to a model with stationary quantum dot.

In general, the QPT is supposed to occur only in the thermodynamical limit. In contrast, we present that the central spin model exhibits a normal-to-superradiant phase transition in the limit where the ratio of the transition frequency of the central spin to that of the bath spins and the number of bath spins tend to infinity. We give the low-energy effective Hamiltonian analytically in the normal phase and the superradiant phase, and we find that the longitudinal interaction Δ can significantly influence the excitation number and the coherence of the ground state. These two quantities are remarkably enhanced for the negative longitudinal interaction while suppressed for the positive longitudinal interaction. In addition, the finite-size effect on the central spin model is also illustrated through the mean-field analysis. We further exploit the quantum Fisher information to characterize the QPT and propose a measurement scheme that can be applied in practice. This work builds a connection between the qubit-spin systems and the qubit-field systems, which provides a possibility for the realization of criticality-enhanced quantum sensing in central spin systems.},

However, large clusters of interacting spins--such as those found in molecules--result in highly complex spectra. Imaging these complex systems is challenging because it requires high spectral resolution and efficient spatial reconstruction with sub-ångström precision.

We present a multidimensional spectroscopy method that isolates individual nuclear-nuclear spin interactions with high spectral resolution (less than 80 millihertz) and high accuracy (2 millihertz). We show that these interactions encode the composition and inter-connectivity of the cluster, and develop methods to extract the three-dimensional structure of the cluster with sub-ångström resolution.

  Abstract                 = {Spins associated with single defects in solids provide promising qubits for quantum-information processing and quantum networks. Recent experiments have demonstrated long coherence times, high-fidelity operations, and long-range entanglement. However, control has so far been limited to a few qubits, with entangled states of three spins demonstrated. Realizing larger multiqubit registers is challenging due to the need for quantum gates that avoid cross talk and protect the coherence of the complete register. In this paper, we present novel decoherence-protected gates that combine dynamical decoupling of an electron spin with selective phase-controlled driving of nuclear spins. We use these gates to realize a ten-qubit quantum register consisting of the electron spin of a nitrogen-vacancy center and nine nuclear spins in diamond. We show that the register is fully connected by generating entanglement between all 45 possible qubit pairs and realize genuine multipartite entangled states with up to seven qubits. Finally, we investigate the register as a multiqubit memory. We demonstrate the protection of an arbitrary single-qubit state for over 75 s—the longest reported for a single solid-state qubit—and show that two-qubit entanglement can be preserved for over 10 s. Our results enable the control of large quantum registers with long coherence times and therefore open the door to advanced quantum algorithms and quantum networks with solid-state spin qubits.},

  abstract      = {Abstract The desire to control and measure individual quantum systems such as atoms and ions in a vacuum has led to significant scientific and engineering developments in the past decades that form the basis of today's quantum information science. Single atoms and molecules on surfaces, on the other hand, are heavily investigated by physicists, chemists, and material scientists in search of novel electronic and magnetic functionalities. These two paths crossed in 2015 when it was first clearly demonstrated that individual spins on a surface can be coherently controlled and read out in an all-electrical fashion. The enabling technique is a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and electron spin resonance, which offers unprecedented coherent controllability at the Angstrom length scale. This review aims to illustrate the essential ingredients that allow the quantum operations of single spins on surfaces. Three domains of applications of surface spins, namely quantum sensing, quantum control, and quantum simulation, are discussed with physical principles explained and examples presented. Enabled by the atomically-precise fabrication capability of STM, single spins on surfaces might one day lead to the realization of quantum nanodevices and artificial quantum materials at the atomic scale.},

  Abstract                 = {The development of electron spin resonance (ESR) combined with scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STM) is undoubtedly one of the main experimental breakthroughs in surface science of the last decade thanks to joining the extraordinarily high energy resolution of ESR (nano-eV scale) with the single-atom spatial resolution of STM (sub-Ångström scale). While the experimental results have significantly grown with the number of groups that have succeeded in implementing the technique, the physical mechanism behind it is still unclear, with several different mechanisms proposed to explain it. Here, we start by revising the main characteristics of the experimental setups and observed features. Then, we review the main theoretical proposals, with both their strengths and weaknesses. One of our conclusions is that many of the proposed mechanisms share the same basic principles, the time-dependent electric field at the STM junction is modulating the coupling of the spin-polarized transport electrons with the local spin. This explains why these mechanims are essentially equivalent in a broad picture. We analyze the subtle differences between some of them and how they compare with the different experimental observations.},

Aza-triangulenes were obtained by reducing ketone-substituted precursors. Exposure to atomic hydrogen followed by thermal annealing and, when necessary, manipulations with the scanning probe afforded the target product. We demonstrate that on Au(111), aza-triangulene donates an electron to the substrate and exhibits an open-shell triplet ground state. This is derived from the different Kondo resonances of the final aza-triangulene product and a series of intermediates on Au(111). Experimentally mapped molecular orbitals match with DFT-calculated counterparts for a positively charged aza-triangulene. In contrast, aza-triangulene on Ag(111) receives an extra electron from the substrate and displays a closed-shell character.

  Abstract                 = {Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), low-dimensional platforms for carbon-based electronics, show the promising perspective to also incorporate spin polarization in their conjugated electron system. However, magnetism in GNRs is generally associated with localized states around zigzag edges, difficult to fabricate and with high reactivity. Here we demonstrate that magnetism can also be induced away from physical GNR zigzag edges through atomically precise engineering topological defects in its interior. A pair of substitutional boron atoms inserted in the carbon backbone breaks the conjugation of their topological bands and builds two spin-polarized boundary states around them. The spin state was detected in electrical transport measurements through boron-substituted GNRs suspended between the tip and the sample of a scanning tunneling microscope. First-principle simulations find that boron pairs induce a spin 1, which is modified by tuning the spacing between pairs. Our results demonstrate a route to embed spin chains in GNRs, turning them into basic elements of spintronic devices.},

  Abstract                 = {Carbon-based magnetic structures promise significantly longer coherence times than traditional magnetic materials, which is of fundamental importance for spintronic applications. An elegant way of achieving carbon-based magnetic moments is the design of graphene nanostructures with an imbalanced occupation of the two sublattices forming the carbon honeycomb lattice. According to Lieb's theorem, this induces local magnetic moments that are proportional to the sublattice imbalance. Exact positioning of sublattice imbalanced nanostructures in graphene nanomaterials hence offers a route to control interactions between induced local magnetic moments and to obtain graphene nanomaterials with magnetically non-trivial ground states. Here, we show that such sublattice imbalanced nanostructures can be incorporated along a large band gap armchair graphene nanoribbon on the basis of asymmetric zigzag edge extensions, which is achieved by incorporating specifically designed precursor monomers during the bottom-up fabrication of the graphene nanoribbons. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy of an isolated and electronically decoupled zigzag edge extension reveals Hubbard-split states in accordance with theoretical predictions. Investigation of pairs of such zigzag edge extensions reveals ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic or quenching of the magnetic interactions depending on the relative alignment of the asymmetric edge extensions. Moreover, a ferromagnetic spin chain is demonstrated for a periodic pattern of zigzag edge extensions along the nanoribbon axis. This work opens a route towards the design and fabrication of graphene nanoribbon-based spin chains with complex magnetic ground states.},

However, on-surface synthesis of GNRs is typically based on metal-surface assisted chemical reactions, where metallic substrates strongly screen their designer electronic properties and limit further applications. Here, we present an on-surface synthesis approach to forming atomically precise GNRs directly on semiconducting metal oxide surfaces. The thermally triggered multistep transformations preprogrammed in our precursors’ design rely on highly selective and sequential activations of C-Br, C-F bonds and cyclodehydrogenation. The formation of planar armchair GNRs terminated by well-defined zigzag ends is confirmed by scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, which also reveal weak interaction between GNRs and the rutile TiO2 substrate.},

Intriguingly, this was only realized for a few species put on a two-layers thick MgO. Here, we systematically quantify from first-principles the hyperfine interactions of the whole series of 3d transition adatoms deposited on various thicknesses of MgO, NaF, NaCl, h-BN, and Cu2N films. We identify the adatom-substrate complexes with the largest hyperfine interactions and unveil the main trends and exceptions. We reveal the core mechanisms at play, such as the interplay of the local bonding geometry and the chemical nature of the thin films, which trigger transitions between high- and low-spin states accompanied with subtle internal rearrangements of the magnetic electrons. By providing a general map of hyperfine interactions, our work has immediate implications in future STM investigations aiming at detecting and realizing quantum concepts hinging on nuclear spins.},

From simple spin resonance to long-distance remote entanglement, the complexity of working with spin defects is fast advancing, and requires an in-depth understanding of their spin, optical, charge, and material properties in this modern context. This is especially critical for discovering new relevant systems dedicated to specific quantum applications. In this review, we therefore expand upon all the key components with an emphasis on the properties of defects and the host material, on engineering opportunities and other pathways for improvement.

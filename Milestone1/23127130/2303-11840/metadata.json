    "abstract": "The accuracy of facial expression recognition is typically affected by the following factors: high similarities across different expressions, disturbing factors, and micro-facial movement of rapid and subtle changes. One potentially viable solution for addressing these barriers is to exploit the neutral information concealed in neutral expression images. To this end, in this paper we propose a self-Paced Neutral Expression-Disentangled Learning (SPNDL) model. SPNDL disentangles neutral information from facial expressions, making it easier to extract key and deviation features. Specifically, it allows to capture discriminative information among similar expressions and perceive micro-facial movements. In order to better learn these neutral expression-disentangled features (NDFs) and to alleviate the non-convex optimization problem, a self-paced learning (SPL) strategy based on NDFs is proposed in the training stage. SPL learns samples from easy to complex by increasing the number of samples selected into the training process, which enables to effectively suppress the negative impacts introduced by low-quality samples and inconsistently distributed NDFs. Experiments on three popular databases (i.e., CK+, Oulu-CASIA, and RAF-DB) show the effectiveness of our proposed method.",

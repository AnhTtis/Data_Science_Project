abstract = {Collective nuclear states are described by symmetric couplings of proton and neutron pairs. These J=0 and J=2 pairs are represented by s- and d-bosons respectively. The multiplet structure of the combined system is given by representations of the SU (6) × SU (2) group, the Arima-Iachello interacting bosons corresponding to the fully symmetric ones. The validity of the boson picture is attributed to the attractive proton-neutron interaction which is also responsible for the transition from vibrational to rotational spectra.}

  abstract={We analyse the phase structure of a class of interacting boson models with two types of bosons, one scalar and one non-scalar, subject to one- and two-body interactions and with dynamic algebra U ( n ). To these models, we associate a classical description in terms of f = n − 1 variables. We show that, if the system is invariant under two- or three-dimensional rotations (for f ≥ 2 even or odd), the models have both first- and second-order phase transitions only if f = 5, 9, 13, .... In the other f ≥ 2 cases, the system has only second-order transitions. All phase transitions of this class of models belong to the cusp catastrophe in the classification of structurally unstable potentials.}

We classify typical ESQPT signatures in the spectra of energy eigenstates with respect to the underlying classical dynamics and outline a variety of quantum systems in which they occur. We describe thermodynamic and dynamic consequences of ESQPTs, like those in microcanonical thermodynamics, quantum quench dynamics, and in the response to nearly adiabatic or periodic driving. We hint at some generalizations of the ESQPT concept in periodic lattices and in resonant tunneling systems.}

By analyzing the distribution of zeros of the ground state Husimi function we have characterized each phase and each type of quantum phase transition in this model. We show that Rényi–Wehrl entropies of the ground state Husimi function give a good description of quantum phase transitions. The study has been done using a numerical treatment and a variational approximation in terms of coherent states. Additionally, we have analyzed quantum phase transitions using the fidelity and fidelity susceptibility concepts.}

We apply this Hamiltonian to the modeling of the bending spectrum of four molecules: HNC, H2S, Si2C, and NCNCS. The selected molecular species include linear, bent, and nonrigid equilibrium structures, proving the versatility of the algebraic approach which allows for the consideration of utterly different physical cases within a single Hamiltonian and a general formalism. For each case we compute predicted bending energies and wave functions, that we use to depict the associated quantum monodromy diagram, Birge-Sponer plot, and participation ratio. In nonrigid cases, we also show the bending energy functional obtained using the coherent –or intrinsic– state formalism."

abstract="The out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) is considered as a measure of quantum chaos. We formulate how to calculate the OTOC for quantum mechanics with a general Hamiltonian. We demonstrate explicit calculations of OTOCs for a harmonic oscillator, a particle in a one-dimensional box, a circle billiard and stadium billiards. For the first two cases, OTOCs are periodic in time because of their commensurable energy spectra. For the circle and stadium billiards, they are not recursive but saturate to constant values which are linear in temperature. Although the stadium billiard is a typical example of the classical chaos, an expected exponential growth of the OTOC is not found. We also discuss the classical limit of the OTOC. Analysis of a time evolution of a wavepacket in a box shows that the OTOC can deviate from its classical value at a time much earlier than the Ehrenfest time, which could be the reason of the difficulty for the numerical analyses to exhibit the exponential growth.",

Specifically, we mildly perturb a thermofield double state by adding a small number of quanta on one side. If these quanta are released a scrambling time in the past, they destroy the local two-sided correlations present in the unperturbed state. The corresponding bulk geometry is a two-sided AdS black hole, and the key effect is the blueshift of the early infalling quanta relative to the t = 0 slice, creating a shock wave. We comment on string- and Planck-scale corrections to this setup, and discuss points that may be relevant to the firewall controversy.",

Chaos can be diagnosed using an out-of-time-order correlation function closely related to the commutator of operators separated in time. We conjecture that the influence of chaos on this correlator can develop no faster than exponentially, with Lyapunov exponent $\lambda$L≤ 2$\pi$kBT/ℏ. We give a precise mathematical argument, based on plausible physical assumptions, establishing this conjecture.",

	abstract = {The non-integrability of quantum systems, often associated with chaotic behavior, is a concept typically applied to cases with a high-dimensional Hilbert space. Among different indicators signaling this behavior, the study of the long-time oscillations of the Out-of-Time Ordered Correlator (OTOC) appears as a versatile tool, that can be adapted to the case of systems with a small number of degrees of freedom. Using such an approach, we consider the oscillations observed after the scrambling time in the measurement of OTOCs of local operators for an Ising spin chain on a nuclear magnetic resonance quantum simulator (Li J. et al., Phys. Rev. X, 7 (2017) 031011). We show that the systematic of the OTOC oscillations describes qualitatively well, in a chain with only 4 spins, the integrability-to-chaos transition inherited from the infinite chain.}

abstract = {We propose a scheme in which the {Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick} model is realized within a circuit QED system. An array of N superconducting qubits interacts with a driven cavity mode. In the dispersive regime, the cavity mode is adiabatically eliminated generating an effective model for the qubits alone. The characteristic long-range order of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model is here mediated by the cavity field. For a closed qubit system, the inherent second-order phase transition of the qubits is reflected in the intensity of the output cavity field. In the broken symmetry phase, the many-body ground state is highly entangled. Relaxation of the qubits is analyzed within a mean-field treatment. The second-order phase transition is lost, while new bistable regimes occur.}

	abstract = {The ubiquitous Lipkin model is investigated for an interaction parameter beyond the traditional critical point. It is argued that a phase transition occurs higher up in the spectrum for such larger interaction, where, using appropriate scaling of the energies, the position of the phase transition becomes independent of the particle number. The phase transition is related to near singularities in the complex interaction plane, the exceptional points. Consideration of finite temperature yields the well-known physical features associated with phase transitions.}

abstract = {Quantum phase transitions affecting the structure of ground and excited states of integrable systems with the Mexican-hat type potential are shown to be related to a singular torus of classical orbits passing the point of unstable equilibrium. As a specific example, we consider nuclear collective vibrations described by the O(6)–U(5) transitional Hamiltonian of the interacting boson model. While all states with zero values of the O(5) invariant undergo a continuous phase transition when crossing the energy of unstable equilibrium, the other states evolve in an analytic way.}

abstract = {Quantum systems with a finite number of freedom degrees f develop robust singularities in the energy spectrum of excited states as the system’s size increases to infinity. We analyze the general form of these singularities for low f, particularly f=2, clarifying the relation to classical stationary points of the corresponding potential. Signatures in the smoothed energy dependence of the quantum state density and in the flow of energy levels with an arbitrary control parameter are described along with the relevant thermodynamical consequences. The general analysis is illustrated with specific examples of excited-state singularities accompanying the first-order quantum phase transition.}

    "abstract": "Excited state quantum phase transitions in collective many-body quantum systems influence the system spectral properties due to changing degeneracy patterns in different phases. We report a fundamental difference in the nature of the degeneracy for boson two-level models, depending on the dimension of the space where the models were defined. To illustrate the consequences, we assess the validity of an out-of-time-order correlator as a possible order operator for excited state quantum phase transitions in different models.",

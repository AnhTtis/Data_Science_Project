\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we propose an adaptive active learning framework with adaptive superpixels.
Our merging and sieving methods operate adaptively every round, and the experimental results demonstrate the performance improvement of adaptive merging in various realistic situations.
Furthermore, we suggest novel achievable metrics for evaluating superpixels in advance that are suitable for active learning.

\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:conclusions}
In this paper we presented \codename{IMPACT}, a toolchain for nonlinear model predictive control that reduces the engineering complexity of the different steps from problem specification to MPC solution deployment. The different modules that compose the toolchain, their dependencies and their usage workflow were described. In the wide space of academic software, \impact stands out by offering a unified cross-lingual high-level way to model OCPs, and a unified \codename{C} API to communicate with exported MPC controllers. Future directions include the implementation of a method to allow the \codename{C} API to be exported as an FMU. We will also validate 
% the effectiveness of 
the toolchain in more complex scenarios involving complex robotic systems and self-driving cars.

    "abstract": "Motivated by the potential to suppress the antiferromagnetic long-range order in favor of the long-sought-after Kitaev quantum spin liquid state, we study the effect of spin vacancies in the extended Kitaev-Heisenberg model. In particular, we focus on a realistic model obtained from fitting inelastic neutron scattering on $α$-RuCl$_3$. We observe that the long-range zigzag magnetic ordered state only survives when the doping concentration is smaller than 5\\%. Upon further increasing the spin vacancy concentration, the ground state becomes a short-range ordered state at low temperatures. Compared with experiments, our classical solution over-stabilizes the zigzag correlation in the presence of spin vacancies. Our theoretical results provide guidance toward interpreting inelastic neutron scattering experiments on magnetically diluted Kitaev candidate materials.",

    "abstract": "The lowest-lying charmonium-like tetraquarks $c\\bar{c}q\\bar{q}$ $(q=u,\\,d)$ and $c\\bar{c}s\\bar{s}$, with spin-parity $J^P=0^+$, $1^+$ and $2^+$, and isospin $I=0$ and $1$, are systematically investigated within the theoretical framework of complex-scaling range for a chiral quark model that has already been successfully applied in former studies of various tetra- and penta-quark systems. A four-body $S$-wave configuration which includes meson-meson, diquark-antidiquark and K-type arrangements of quarks, along with all possible color wave functions, is comprehensively considered. Several narrow resonances are obtained in each tetraquark channel when a fully coupled-channel computation is performed. We tentatively assign theoretical states to experimentally reported charmonium-like signals such as $X(3872)$, $Z_c(3900)$, $X(3960)$, $X(4350)$, $X(4685)$ and $X(4700)$. They can be well identified as hadronic molecules; however, other exotic components which involve, for instance, hidden-color channels or diquark-antidiquark structures play a considerable role. Meanwhile, two resonances are obtained at $4.04$ GeV and $4.14$ GeV which may be compatible with experimental data in the energy interval $4.0-4.2$ GeV. Furthermore, the $X(3940)$ and $X(4630)$ may be identified as color compact tetraquark resonances. Finally, we also find few resonance states in the energy interval from $4.5$ GeV to $5.0$ GeV, which would be awaiting for discovery in future experiments.",

@article{KahlerEtAl_2019_gw,
	abstract = { Groundwater contamination is expensive to remediate, primarily because of the treatment time required. Increased treatment time can be caused by several contributing factors, such as sequestration in low-permeability regions of an aquifer, which can cause tailing and rebound phenomena. One such region consists of dead-end pores. Once a contaminant enters the dead-end pores, it remains in an eddy and only moves back into well-connected pores, from which it can be advected away, by molecular diffusion. A previous study with computational fluid dynamics suggested that rapidly pulsed flow demonstrated the potential to accelerate contaminant removal from dead-end pores. Here, we tested the recovery of a dissolved contaminant under steady and rapidly pulsed flow from a porous media column with crushed glass, which should have naturally formed dead-end pores. This test simulated the fluid dynamics in a flow constrained by a column without sorption; therefore, this tested the dynamics in the dead-end pores but did not include the complete dynamics of a remediation scheme. The results showed accelerated removal under rapidly pulsed flow, which is consistent with results from the computational model; however, there may be additional or alternative sources of the sequestered contaminant. },

	abstract = {Exosomes are nanometer-sized lipid vesicles present in liquid biopsies and used as biomarkers for several diseases including cancer, Alzheimer's, and central nervous system diseases. Purification and subsequent size and surface characterization are essential to exosome-based diagnostics. Sample purification is, however, time consuming and potentially damaging, and no current method gives the size and zeta potential from a single measurement. Here, we concentrate exosomes from a dilute solution and measure their size and zeta potential in a one-step measurement with a salt gradient in a capillary channel. The salt gradient causes oppositely directed particle and fluid transport that trap particles. Within minutes, the particle concentration increases more than two orders of magnitude. A fit to the spatial distribution of a single or an ensemble of exosomes returns both their size and surface charge. Our method is applicable for other types of nanoparticles. The capillary is fabricated in a low-cost polymer device.},

	abstract = {The transport of particulate matter to and from dead-end pores is difficult to achieve due to confinement effects. Diffusiophoresis is a phenomenon that results in the controlled motion of colloids along solute concentration gradients. Thus{,} by establishing an electrolyte concentration gradient within dead-end pores{,} it is possible to induce the flow of particles into and out of the pores via diffusiophoresis{,} as has been demonstrated recently. In this paper{,} we explain the pore-scale mechanism by which individual colloids are entrained in dead-end pores by diffusiophoresis. We flow particles past a series of dead-end pores in the presence of a solute concentration gradient. Our results reveal that particles execute pore-to-pore hops before ultimately being captured. We categorize an event as particle capture when the particle{'}s trajectory terminates within the dead-end pore. Experiments and numerical simulations demonstrate that particle capture only occurs when flowing particles are positioned sufficiently close to the pore entry. Outside this capture region{,} the particles have insufficient diffusiophoretic velocities to induce capture and their dynamics are largely dominated by their free-stream advective velocities. We observe that the particles move closer to the device wall as they hop{,} thereby reducing the effect of flow advection and increasing that of diffusiophoresis. These results enhance our understanding of suspension dynamics in a driven system and have implications for the development{,} design{,} and optimization of diffusiophoretic platforms for drug delivery{,} cosmetics{,} and material recovery.},

	abstract = {We have developed a new experimental technique to observe particle movement driven by diffusiophoresis. This method-the stopped-flow diffusion cell (SFDC)-allows two particle suspensions to be brought into intimate contact while providing an initially steep, well-defined solute gradient at the junction between the suspensions. With this technique the manifestation of diffusiophoresis is the spontaneous formation of a concentrated band of particles, a band that moves in response to the transient decay of the initial step-function solute gradient. We have used the SFDC to measure electrolyte diffusiophoresis of 0.1- to 1-$\mu$m diameter charged latex particles in NaCl and KCl gradients. These measurements substantiate Anderson and Prieve's theory of diffusiophoresis. The spontaneous formation of colloidal particle bands has implications for separation processes as well as naturally occurring segregation phenomena, including biological colloids.},

      surface of an electrolyte solution. The attachment of colloidal particles to a free
      surface of an electrolyte solution, which may interface with another liquid or vapor
      phase, is a well-known phenomenon that is employed in many scientific and industrial
      applications, the most well-known of which is the Pickering emulsion. In addition to
      capillary stresses, the particles will experience an electrical double layer (EDL)
      force when they are close to each other. The force originates from the overlap of
      the diffusive layers of ions that appear in the electrolyte solution next to the
      charged surfaces of the particles and the charged surface of the electrolyte
      solution, which is free of particles. Here, we elucidate the contribution of the
      free surface of the electrolyte solution to the EDL force between two spherical
      particles, which are half-submerged in the electrolyte solution. We solve the
      linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation for the excess electrical potential near the
      particles and integrate over the resulting excess Maxwell and osmotic stresses on
      the particles. We further give corresponding P{\'a}de approximations, thus enabling the
      use of simple formulas for the EDL force between interacting particles in cases
      similar to the ones in this study without the need to repeat the mathematical

	abstract = {Dead-end geometries are commonly found in many porous systems. Particle transport into such dead-end pores is often important, but is difficult to achieve owing to the confinement. It is natural to expect that Brownian motion is the sole mechanism to deliver the particles into the pores, but that mechanism is, unfortunately, slow and inefficient. Here, we introduce solute gradient to control the transport of particles in dead-end channels. We demonstrate a size effect such that larger particles tend to focus more and reside deeper in the channels. Our findings suggest a potential pathway to many useful applications that are difficult to achieve in dead-end geometries such as particle sorting and sample preconcentration, which are important in pharmaceuticals and healthcare industries.Transport of colloids in dead-end channels is involved in widespread applications including drug delivery and underground oil and gas recovery. In such geometries, Brownian motion may be considered as the sole mechanism that enables transport of colloidal particles into or out of the channels, but it is, unfortunately, an extremely inefficient transport mechanism for microscale particles. Here, we explore the possibility of diffusiophoresis as a means to control the colloid transport in dead-end channels by introducing a solute gradient. We demonstrate that the transport of colloidal particles into the dead-end channels can be either enhanced or completely prevented via diffusiophoresis. In addition, we show that size-dependent diffusiophoretic transport of particles can be achieved by considering a finite Debye layer thickness effect, which is commonly ignored. A combination of diffusiophoresis and Brownian motion leads to a strong size-dependent focusing effect such that the larger particles tend to concentrate more and reside deeper in the channel. Our findings have implications for all manners of controlled release processes, especially for site-specific delivery systems where localized targeting of particles with minimal dispersion to the nontarget area is essential.},

These membranes, however, cause many drawbacks such as a high pumping cost and a need for periodic replacement due to fouling. Here we show an alternative membraneless method for separating suspended particles by exposing the colloidal suspension to CO2. Dissolution of CO2 into the suspension creates solute gradients that drive phoretic motion of particles. Due to the large diffusion potential generated by the dissociation of carbonic acid, colloidal particles move either away from or towards the gas--liquid interface depending on their surface charge. Using the directed motion of particles induced by exposure to CO2, we demonstrate a scalable, continuous flow, membraneless particle filtration process that exhibits low energy consumption, three orders of magnitude lower than conventional microfiltration/ultrafiltration processes, and is essentially free from fouling.},

	abstract = {The zeta potential is an electric potential in the Debye screening layer of an electrolyte, which represents a key physicochemical surface property in various fields ranging from electrochemistry to pharmaceuticals. Thus, characterizing the zeta potential is essential for many applications, but available measurement techniques are limited. Electrophoretic light scattering is typically used to measure the zeta potential of particles in suspension, whereas zeta potential measurements of a solid wall in solution rely on either streaming potential or electroosmotic mobility measurement techniques, both of which are expensive and sophisticated. Here, a simple, robust method to simultaneously measure the zeta potential of particles in suspension and solid walls is presented. The method uses solute gradients to induce particle and fluid motions via diffusiophoresis and diffusioosmosis, respectively, which are both sensitive to the zeta potential of the particle and the wall. By visualizing the particle dynamics, both zeta potentials can be determined independently. Finally, a compact microscope is used to demonstrate low-cost zeta potentiometry that allows measurement of both particle and wall zeta potentials, which suggests a cost-effective tool for pharmaceuticals as well as for educational purposes.},

	abstract = {Particle-laden flow is ubiquitous in physiological and diagnostic systems, where usually the particles (e.g., colloidal particles, cells, macromolecules, etc.) gain a nonzero net surface charge when suspended in an aqueous phase. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) has been the most popular material used for microfluidic fabrications for the past two decades. Its high gas permeability is well appreciated, but the possible influence of gas leakage on the motion of charged particles has not been recognized. By systematic experiments and model calculations, we demonstrate that initial (early time) gas leakage through PDMS can create a charge-dependent accumulation of particles in common channel flows by diffusiophoresis and show that the phenomenon can be applied to concentrating and collecting proteins.We identify a phenomenon where the onset of channel flow creates an unexpected, charge-dependent accumulation of colloidal particles, which occurs in a common-flow configuration with gas-permeable walls, but in the absence of any installed source of gas. An aqueous suspension of either positively charged (amine-modified polystyrene; a-PS) or negatively charged (polystyrene; PS) particles that flowed into a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) channel created charge-dependent accumulation 2 to 4 min after the onset of flow. We unravel the phenomenon with systematic experiments under various conditions and model calculations considering permeability of the channel walls and CO2-driven diffusiophoresis. We demonstrate that such spontaneous transport of particles is driven by the gas leakage through permeable walls, which is induced by the pressure difference between the channel and the ambient. Since the liquid pressure is higher, an outward flux of gas forms in the flow. We also observe the phenomenon in a bacterial suspension of Vibrio cholerae, where the fluorescent protein (mKO; monomeric Kusabira Orange) and bacterial cells show charge-dependent separation in a channel flow. Such experimental observations show that diffusiophoresis of charged particles in an aqueous suspension can be achieved by having gas leakage through permeable walls, without any preimposed ion-concentration gradient in the liquid phase. Our findings will help resolve unexpected challenges and biases in on-chip experiments involving particles and gas-permeable walls and help understand similar configurations that naturally exist in physiological systems, such as pulmonary capillaries. We also demonstrate potential applications, such as concentrating and collecting proteins below the isoelectric point.Data related to this work are available on DataSpace (DOI: 10.34770/7607-9f26).},

	abstract = {Contact between low- and high-salinity water occurs in many applications including enhanced oil recovery (EOR), desalination by reverse osmosis, or electric-power production ({\textquotedblleft}blue energy{\textquotedblright}) by pressure-retarded osmosis. The resulting salinity gradients can propel particles which cause fouling of osmosis membranes. In EOR the gradient can transport functionalized nanoparticles into the porous oil-bearing rock. Once transported, the nanoparticles undertake in situ sensing and intervention activities in the rock. At very high salinity, the long-range interaction needed for diffusiophoresis or electrophoresis of charged particles is expected to vanish. Nonetheless, we observed measurable speeds at salinities approaching saturation.Diffusiophoresis is the migration of a colloidal particle through a viscous fluid, caused by a gradient in concentration of some molecular solute; a long-range physical interaction between the particle and solute molecules is required. In the case of a charged particle and an ionic solute (e.g., table salt, NaCl), previous studies have predicted and experimentally verified the speed for very low salt concentrations at which the salt solution behaves ideally. The current study presents a study of diffusiophoresis at much higher salt concentrations (approaching the solubility limit). At such large salt concentrations, electrostatic interactions are almost completely screened, thus eliminating the long-range interaction required for diffusiophoresis; moreover, the high volume fraction occupied by ions makes the solution highly nonideal. Diffusiophoretic speeds were found to be measurable, albeit much smaller than for the same gradient at low salt concentrations.},

@article{WilliamsEtAl_2020_PNAS,
	abstract = {Our bodies rely on molecular transport within a complex, nonequilibrium environment incorporating gradients of charged and neutral solutes. Concentration gradients near solid surfaces are known to induce material transport via diffusioosmotic fluid flow. These are well understood for charged molecules, but less so for neutral molecules such as glucose. Glucose is an important biological energy source and is often distributed in gradients across cell membranes, vasculature, tissues, and whole organs. We measure diffusioosmotic flow due to glucose gradients and find its speed depends only weakly on concentration. Our models can reproduce this behavior by accounting for strong interactions, concentration-dependent viscosity, and heterogeneous surfaces. Understanding these flows will allow us to harness them for improved transport of targeted nanomedicines.Glucose is an important energy source in our bodies, and its consumption results in gradients over length scales ranging from the subcellular to entire organs. Concentration gradients can drive material transport through both diffusioosmosis and convection. Convection arises because concentration gradients are mass density gradients. Diffusioosmosis is fluid flow induced by the interaction between a solute and a solid surface. A concentration gradient parallel to a surface creates an osmotic pressure gradient near the surface, resulting in flow. Diffusioosmosis is well understood for electrolyte solutes, but is more poorly characterized for nonelectrolytes such as glucose. We measure fluid flow in glucose gradients formed in a millimeter-long thin channel and find that increasing the gradient causes a crossover from diffusioosmosis-dominated to convection-dominated flow. We cannot explain this with established theories of these phenomena which predict that both scale linearly. In our system, the convection speed is linear in the gradient, but the diffusioosmotic speed has a much weaker concentration dependence and is large even for dilute solutions. We develop existing models and show that a strong surface{\textendash}solute interaction, a heterogeneous surface, and accounting for a concentration-dependent solution viscosity can explain our data. This demonstrates how sensitive nonelectrolyte diffusioosmosis is to surface and solution properties and to surface{\textendash}solute interactions. A comprehensive understanding of this sensitivity is required to understand transport in biological systems on length scales from micrometers to millimeters where surfaces are invariably complex and heterogeneous.Data for this article are available online in Figshare at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12643205.v2 (71).December 28, 2020: The affiliation of author Giuseppe Battaglia has been updated.},

	abstract = {The progress in microfabrication and lab-on-a-chip technologies has been a major area of development for new approaches to bioanalytics and integrated concepts for cell biology. Fundamental advances in the development of elastomer based microfluidics have been driving factors for making microfluidic technology available to a larger scientific community in the past years. In line with this{,} microfluidic separation of cells and particles is currently developing rapidly where key areas of interest are found in designing lab-on-a-chip systems that offer controlled microenvironments for studies of fundamental cell biology. More recently industrial interests are seen in the development of micro chip based flow cytometry technology both for preclinical research and clinical diagnostics. This critical review outlines the most recent developments in microfluidic technology for cell and particle separation in continuous flow based systems. (130 references)},

@article{SajeeshSen_2014,
	abstract = {Separation and sorting of micron-sized particles has great importance in diagnostics, chemical and biological analyses, food and chemical processing and environmental assessment. By employing the unique characteristics of microscale flow phenomena, various techniques have been established for fast and accurate separation and sorting of microparticles in a continuous manner. The advancements in microfluidics enable sorting technologies that combine the benefits of continuous operation with small-sized scale suitable for manipulation and probing of individual particles or cells. Microfluidic sorting platforms require smaller sample volume, which has several benefits in terms of reduced cost of reagents, analysis time and less invasiveness to patients for sample extraction. Additionally, smaller size of device together with lower fabrication cost allows massive parallelization, which makes high-throughput sorting possible. Both passive and active separation and sorting techniques have been reported in literature. Passive techniques utilize the interaction between particles, flow field and the channel structure and do not require external fields. On the other hand, active techniques make use of external fields in various forms but offer better performance. This paper provides an extensive review of various passive and active separation techniques including basic theories and experimental details. The working principles are explained in detail, and performances of the devices are discussed.},

	abstract = {Summary Separation and concentration technologies are the most important unit operations in food processing. This chapter provides an overview of separation and concentration technologies used in the food industry. It explains their underlying principles, associated advantages and limitations. Physical separation methods are generally suitable for removing suspended solids from slurries or for separating solid particles of mixtures. Pneumatic separation allows the standardization of heterogeneous particle mixtures into uniform fractions based on their density and mass. Filtration methods include conventional filtration, mechanical expression, centrifugation, and membrane technologies. Membrane technologies, including reverse osmosis (RO), nanofiltration (NF), ultrafiltration (UF) and microfiltration (MF), use pressure differences as the driving force of separation. Membrane technologies may be considered as important tools for the efficient use of processing streams without polluting discharges with regard to energy savings, environmental, and quality regulations.},

@article{KirbyEtAl_2004,
	abstract = {Abstract This paper summarizes theory, experimental techniques, and the reported data pertaining to the zeta potential of silica and silicon with attention to use as microfluidic substrate materials, particularly for microchip chemical separations. Dependence on cation concentration, buffer and cation type, pH, cation valency, and temperature are discussed. The Debye-H{\~A}{\OE}ckel limit, which is often correctly treated as a good approximation for describing the ion concentration in the double layer, can lead to serious errors if it is extended to predict the dependence of zeta potential on the counterion concentration. For indifferent univalent electrolytes (e.g., sodium and potassium), two simple scalings for the dependence of zeta potential on counterion concentration can be derived in high- and low-{\^I}¶ limits of the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzman equation solution in the double layer. It is shown that for most situations relevant to microchip separations, the high-{\^I}¶ limit is most applicable, leading to the conclusion that the zeta potential on silica substrates is approximately proportional to the logarithm of the molar counterion concentration. The {\^I}¶ vs. pH dependence measurements from several experiments are compared by normalizing the {\^I}¶ based on concentration.},

@article{AultEtAl_2019_SM,
	abstract = {The accurate measurement of wall zeta potentials and solute-surface interaction length scales for electrolyte and non-electrolyte solutes{,} respectively{,} is critical to the design of many biomedical and microfluidic applications. We present a novel microfluidic approach using diffusioosmosis for measuring either the zeta potentials or the characteristic interaction length scales for surfaces exposed to{,} respectively{,} electrolyte or non-electrolyte solutes. When flows containing different solute concentrations merge in a junction{,} local solute concentration gradients can drive diffusioosmotic flow due to electrokinetic{,} steric{,} and other interactions between the solute molecules and solid surfaces. We demonstrate a microfluidic system consisting of a long{,} narrow pore connecting two large side channels in which solute concentration gradients drive diffusioosmosis within the pore{,} resulting in predictable fluid velocity/pressure and solute profiles. Furthermore{,} we present analytical results and a methodology to determine the zeta potential or interaction length scale for the pore surfaces based on the solute concentrations in the main side channels{,} the flow rate in the pore{,} and the pressure drop across the pore. We apply this method to the experimental data of Lee et al. to predict the zeta potentials of their system{,} and we use 3D numerical simulations to validate the theory and show that end effects caused by the junctions are negligible for a wide range of parameters. Because the dynamics in the proposed system are driven by diffusioosmosis{,} this technique does not suffer from certain disadvantages associated with the use of sensitive electronics in traditional zeta potential measurement approaches such as streaming potential{,} streaming current{,} or electroosmosis. To the best of our knowledge this is the first flow-based approach to characterize surface/solute interactions with non-electrolyte solutes.},

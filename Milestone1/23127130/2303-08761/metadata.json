    "abstract": "In this letter, we show that pore-scale diffusiophoresis of colloidal particles along local salt gradients manifests in the macroscopic dispersion of particles in a porous medium. Despite is transient character, this microscopic phenomenon controls large-scale particle transport by altering their partitioning between transmitting and dead-end pores. It determines the distribution of residence and arrival times in the medium. Depending on the diffusiophoretic mobility, particles can be mobilized from or trapped in dead-end pores, which provides a means for the controlled manipulation of particles in porous media.",

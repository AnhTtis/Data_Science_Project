    "abstract": "The movement of metals through the environment links together a wide range of scientific fields: from earth sciences and geology as weathering releases minerals; to environmental sciences as metals are mobilized and transformed, cycling through soil and water; to biology as living things take up metals from their surroundings. Studies of these fundamental processes all require quantitative analysis of metal concentrations, locations, and chemical states. Synchrotron x-ray tools can address these requirements with high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, and minimal sample preparation. This perspective describes the state of fundamental scientific questions in the lifecycle of metals, from rocks to ecosystems, from soils to plants, and from environment to animals. Key x-ray capabilities and facility infrastructure for future synchrotron-based analytical resources serving these areas are summarized, and potential opportunities for future experiments are explored.",

    "abstract": "We demonstrate the all-optical phase regeneration of a 20 GBaud/s quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) signal, and achieve phase regeneration in high nonlinear fiber (HNLF) at lower power through the Kerr soliton combs as the pumps for the regeneration signal. Meanwhile, we propose a feasible scheme for phase regeneration by using Kerr soliton combs generated by carrier-carrying pumps in actual optical communication receiving systems, and we exploit the effect under different signal ratios in the carrier-carrying pumps on the phase regeneration, which is expected to improve the relay and reception quality of the all-optical communication system.",

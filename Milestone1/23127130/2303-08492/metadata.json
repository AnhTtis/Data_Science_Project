    "abstract": "We analyze the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) heating by the incident terahertz (THz) radiation in the field-effect transistor (FET) structures with the graphene channels (GCs) and the black-phosphorus and black-arsenic gate barrier layers (BLs). Such GC-FETs can operate as bolometric THz detectors using the thermionic emission of the hot electrons from the GC via the BL into the gate. Due to the excitation of plasmonic oscillations in the GC by the THz signals, the GC-FET detector response can be pronouncedly resonant, leading to elevated values of the detector responsivity. The lateral thermal conductivity of the 2DEG can markedly affect the GC-FET responsivity, in particular, its spectral characteristics. This effect should be considered for the optimization of the GC-FET detectors.",

    abstract = "{Narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies have low-mass black holes and mass accretion rates close to (or exceeding) Eddington, so a standard blackbody accretion disc should peak in the extreme ultraviolet. However, the lack of true absorption opacity in the disc means that the emission is better approximated by a colour temperature corrected blackbody, and this colour temperature correction is large enough (∼2.4) that the bare disc emission from a zero spin black hole can extend into the soft X-ray bandpass. Part of the soft X-ray excess seen in these objects must be intrinsic emission from the disc unless the vertical structure is very different to that predicted.None the less, this is not the whole story even for the extreme NLS1 as the shape of the soft excess is much broader than predicted by a bare disc spectrum, indicating some Compton upscattering by warm, optically thick material. We associate this with the disc itself, so it must ultimately be powered by mass accretion. We build an energetically self-consistent model assuming that the emission thermalizes to a (colour temperature corrected) blackbody only at large radii. At smaller radii the gravitational energy is split between powering optically thick Comptonized disc emission (forming the soft X-ray excess) and an optically thin corona above the disc (forming the tail to higher energies). We show examples of this model fit to the extreme NLS1 RE J1034+396, and to the much lower Eddington fraction broad-line Seyfert 1 PG 1048+231. We use these to guide our fits and interpretations of three template spectra made from co-adding multiple sources to track out a sequence of active galactic nucleus (AGN) spectra as a function of L/LEdd.Both the individual objects and template spectra show the surprising result that the Compton upscattered soft X-ray excess decreases in importance with increasing L/LEdd. The strongest soft excesses are associated with low mass accretion rate AGN rather than being tied to some change in disc structure around Eddington. We argue that this suggests a true break in accretion flow properties between stellar and supermassive black holes.The new model is publicly available within the xspec spectral fitting package.}",

As in the first XMM–Newton observation, a sharp spectral drop is detected with energy that has shifted from 7 to 7.5 keV in two years. The drop is interpreted in terms of relativistically blurred ionized reflection from the accretion disc, while the energy shift can be accounted for by changes in the ionization state and, more importantly, emissivity profile on the disc. A flatter emissivity profile during the second higher flux observation reduces gravitational redshift effects, therefore shifting the edge to higher energy. Remarkably, ionized disc reflection and the associated power‐law continuum provide a reasonable description of the broad‐band spectrum, including the soft excess. Considering both observations, the spectral variability in 1H 0707–495 appears to be a result of the interplay between these two spectral components. The reflection component in the second observation is significantly less variable than the power law. Changes of the emissivity profile, spectral shape and variability properties (such as the rms spectrum) within the two observations are all consistent with a recently proposed model in which relativistic effects in the very inner regions of the nucleus play a major role.}",

    abstract = "{A model for the inner regions of accretion flows is presented where, owing to disc instabilities, cold and dense material is clumped into deep sheets or rings. Surrounding these density enhancements is hot, tenuous gas where coronal dissipation processes occur. We expect this situation to be most relevant when the accretion rate is close to Eddington and the disc is radiation-pressure-dominated, and so may apply to narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies. In this scenario, the hard X-ray source is obscured for most observers, and so the detected X-ray emission would be dominated by reflection off the walls of the sheets. A simple Comptonization calculation shows that the large photon-indices characteristic of NLS1s would be a natural outcome of two reprocessors closely surrounding the hard X-ray source. We test this model by fitting the XMM-Newton spectrum of the NLS1 1H 0707–495 between 0.5 and 11 keV with reflection-dominated ionized disc models. A very good fit is found with three different reflectors each subject to the same Γ=2.35 power law. An iron overabundance is still required to fit the sharp drop in the spectrum at around 7 keV. We note that even a small corrugation of the accretion disc may result in Γ\\&gt;2 and a strong reflection component in the observed spectrum. Therefore, this model may also explain the strength and the variability characteristics of the MCG–6-30-15 Fe Kα line. The idea needs to be tested with further broad-band XMM-Newton observations of NLS1s.}",

	abstract = {We present the first systematic study of (non-radio-selected) radio-loud narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies. Cross-correlation of the Catalogue of Quasars and Active Nuclei with several radio and optical catalogs led to the identification of ∼11 radio-loud NLS1 candidates, including four previously known ones. This study almost triples the number of known radio-loud NLS1 galaxies if all candidates are confirmed. Most of the radio-loud NLS1 galaxies are compact, steep-spectrum sources accreting close to or above the Eddington limit. The radio-loud NLS1 galaxies of our sample are remarkable in that they occupy a previously rarely populated regime in NLS1 multiwavelength parameter space. While their [O III]/Hβ and Fe II/Hβ intensity ratios almost cover the whole range observed in NLS1 galaxies, their radio properties extend the range of radio-loud objects to those with small widths of the broad Balmer lines. Their black hole masses are generally at the upper observed end among NLS1 galaxies but are still unusually small in view of the radio loudness of the sources. Among the radio-detected NLS1 galaxies, the radio index R is distributed quite smoothly up to the critical value of R ≃ 10 and covers about 4 orders of magnitude in total. Statistics show that ∼7% of the NLS1 galaxies are formally radio-loud, while only 2.5% exceed a radio index R > 100. Implications for NLS1 models are discussed. Several mechanisms are considered as explanations for the radio loudness of the NLS1 galaxies and for the lower frequency of radio-loud galaxies among NLS1 galaxies than among quasars. While properties of most sources (with two to three exceptions) generally do not favor relativistic beaming, the combination of accretion mode and spin may explain the observations.}

    abstract = "{The narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4051 is known to exhibit significant X-ray spectral/flux variations and have a number of emission/absorption features. X-ray observations have revealed that these absorption features are blueshifted, which indicates that NGC 4051 has warm absorber outflow. In order to constrain physical parameters of the warm absorber outflow, we analyse the archival data with the longest exposure taken by XMM–Newton in 2009. We calculate the root-mean-square (rms) spectra with the grating spectral resolution for the first time. The rms spectra have a sharp peak and several dips, which can be explained by variable absorption features and non-variable emission lines; a lower ionized warm absorber (WA1: log ξ = 1.5, v = −650 km s−1) shows large variability, whereas higher ionized warm absorbers (WA2: log ξ = 2.5, v = −4100 km s−1, WA3: log ξ = 3.4, v = −6100 km s−1) show little variability. WA1 shows the maximum variability at a time-scale of ∼104 s, suggesting that the absorber locates at ∼103 times of the Schwarzschild radius. The depth of the absorption features due to WA1 and the observed soft X-ray flux are anticorrelated in several observational sequences, which can be explained by variation of partial covering fraction of the double-layer blobs that are composed of the Compton-thick core and the ionized layer (=WA1). WA2 and WA3 show little variability and presumably extend uniformly in the line of sight. The present result shows that NGC 4051 has two types of the warm absorber outflows; the static, high-ionized and extended line-driven disc winds and the variable, low-ionized and clumpy double-layer blobs.}",

The imaging data reveal a number of serendipitous hard X-ray sources in some source fields, but none contribute significantly to the hard X-ray flux of the active galactic nuclei. All but one of the Seyferts show evidence for variability on timescales of minutes to hours, with the amplitude anticorrelated with the source luminosity, confirming previous results. In at least eight sources there is evidence that the variability amplitude below 2 keV is greater than that in the hard X-ray band, perhaps indicating variable components other than the power law in the soft band. Ultrarapid variability, implying significant power at frequencies greater than 10-3 Hz is detected in at least five sources but is difficult to detect in most cases, because of the sampling and signal-to-noise ratio. In Mrk 766 and MCG -6-30-15 there is also an indication that the high-frequency power spectra are variable in shape and/or intensity. There is similar evidence in NGC 4151 but on longer timescales.}

We find the hard X‐ray band to be significantly affected by reflection from cold matter, which can also explain a non‐varying, narrow Fe K fluorescent line. We interpret major differences between the high‐ and low‐flux hard X‐ray spectra in terms of the varying ionization (opacity) of a substantial column of outflowing gas. An emission‐line spectrum in the low‐flux state indicates an extended region of photoionized gas. A high‐velocity, highly ionized outflow seen in the high‐flux state spectrum can replenish the gas in the extended emission region over ∼103 yr, while having sufficient kinetic energy to contribute significantly to the hard X‐ray continuum.}",

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {We study the hard X-ray spectral properties of 10 highly luminous radio-quiet (RQ) active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at z = 1.3–3.2, including new XMM-Newton observations of four of these sources. We find a significant correlation between the normalized accretion rate (L/LEdd) and the hard X-ray photon index (Γ) for 35 moderate- to high-luminosity RQ AGNs, including our 10 highly luminous sources. Within the limits of our sample, we show that a measurement of Γ and LX can provide an estimate of L/LEdd and black hole mass (MBH) with a mean uncertainty of a factor of ≲3 on the predicted values of these properties. This may provide a useful probe for tracing the history of BH growth in the universe, utilizing samples of X-ray-selected AGNs for which L/LEdd and MBH have not yet been determined systematically. It may prove to be a useful way to probe BH growth in distant Compton-thin type 2 AGNs. We also find that the optical-X-ray spectral slope (αox) depends primarily on optical-UV luminosity rather than on L/LEdd in a sample of RQ AGNs spanning 5 orders of magnitude in luminosity and over 2 orders of magnitude in L/LEdd. We detect a significant Compton-reflection continuum in two of our highly luminous sources, and in the stacked X-ray spectrum of seven other sources with similar luminosities, we obtain a mean relative Compton reflection of R = 0.9+ 0.6−0.5 and an upper limit on the rest-frame equivalent width of a neutral Fe Kα line of 105 eV. We do not detect a significant steepening of the X-ray power-law spectrum below rest-frame 2 keV in any of our highly luminous sources, suggesting that a soft-excess feature, commonly observed in local AGNs, either does not depend strongly on L/LEdd, or is not accessible at high redshifts using current X-ray detectors.}

    abstract = "{The existence of ionized X-ray absorbing layers of gas along the line of sight to the nuclei of Seyfert galaxies is a well established observational fact. This material is systematically outflowing and shows a large range in parameters. However, its actual nature and dynamics are still not clear. In order to gain insights into these important issues we performed a literature search for papers reporting the parameters of the soft X-ray warm absorbers (WAs) in 35 type 1 Seyferts and compared their properties to those of the ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) detected in the same sample. The fraction of sources with WAs is \\&gt;60 per cent, consistent with previous studies. The fraction of sources with UFOs is \\&gt;34 per cent, \\&gt;67 per cent of which also show WAs. The large dynamic range obtained when considering all the absorbers together, spanning several orders of magnitude in ionization, column, velocity and distance allows us, for the first time, to investigate general relations among them. In particular, we find significant correlations indicating that the closer the absorber is to the central black hole, the higher the ionization, column, outflow velocity and consequently the mechanical power. In all the cases, the absorbers continuously populate the whole parameter space, with the WAs and the UFOs lying always at the two ends of the distribution. These evidence strongly suggest that these absorbers, often considered of different types, could actually represent parts of a single large-scale stratified outflow observed at different locations from the black hole. The UFOs are likely launched from the inner accretion disc and the WAs at larger distances, such as the outer disc and/or torus. We argue that the observed parameters and correlations are, to date, consistent with both radiation pressure through Compton scattering and magnetohydrodynamic processes contributing to the outflow acceleration, the latter playing a major role. Most of the absorbers, especially the UFOs, show a sufficiently high mechanical power (at least ∼0.5 per cent of the bolometric luminosity) to provide a significant contribution to active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback and thus to the evolution of the host galaxy. In this regard, we find possible evidence for the interaction of the AGN wind with the surrounding environment on large scales.}",

Here we present the results of an analysis of the European Photon Imaging Camera (EPIC) pn data obtained during the observation. Within the low state, the source shows complex spectral variability which cannot easily be explained by any simple model. However, by making a ‘flux–flux’ plot which combines the low state data with data obtained during a normal flux state, we demonstrate that the extremely hard spectrum observed above 2 keV results from a continuation of the spectral variability seen in the normal state, which is caused by spectral pivoting of the power-law continuum. The pivoting power law appears to be attached to a Comptonized thermal component of variable flux (blackbody temperature kT∼ 0.1 keV, consistent with the small black hole mass in NGC 4051) which dominates the soft X-ray band in the low state, and is probably the source of seed photons for Comptonization. Additional constant thermal and reflection components, together with absorption by ionized gas, seem to be required to complete the picture and explain the complex X-ray spectral variability seen in the low state of NGC 4051.}",

    abstract = "{We present a systematic analysis of the X-ray spectral properties of a sample of 22 ‘narrow-line’ Seyfert 1 galaxies for which data are available from the ASCA public archive. Many of these sources, which were selected on the basis of their relatively narrow Hβ linewidth (FWHM ≤2000 km s−1), show significant spectral complexity in the X-ray band. Their measured hard power-law continua have photon indices spanning the range 1.6–2.5 with a mean of 2.1, which is only slightly steeper than the norm for ‘broad-line’ Seyfert 1s. All but four of the sources exhibit a soft excess, which can be modelled as blackbody emission (Tbb≈100–300 eV) superposed on the underlying power law. This soft component is often so strong that, even in the relatively hard bandpass of ASCA, it contains a significant fraction, if not the bulk, of the X-ray luminosity, apparently ruling out models in which the soft excess is produced entirely through reprocessing of the hard continuum.Most notably, six of the 22 objects show evidence for a broad absorption feature centred in the energy range 1.1–1.4 keV , which could be the signature of resonance absorption in highly ionized material. A further three sources exhibit ‘warm absorption’ edges in the 0.7–0.9 keV bandpass. Remarkably, all nine ‘absorbed’ sources have Hβ linewidths below 1000 km s−1, which is less than the median value for the sample taken as a whole. This tendency for very narrow linewidths to correlate with the presence of ionized absorption features in the soft X-ray spectra of NLS1s, if confirmed in larger samples, may provide a further clue in the puzzle of active galactic nuclei.}",

The quantities commonly used to estimate the variability amplitude in AGN light curves, such as the fractional rms variability amplitude, Fvar, and excess variance, σ2XS, are examined. Their statistical properties, relationship to the power spectrum and uses for investigating the nature of the variability processes are discussed. We demonstrate that σ2XS (or similarly Fvar) shows large changes from one part of the light curve to the next, even when the variability is produced by a stationary process. This limits the usefulness of these estimators for quantifying differences in variability amplitude between different sources or from epoch to epoch in one source. Some examples of the expected scatter in the variance are tabulated for various typical power spectral shapes, based on Monte Carlo simulations. The excess variance can be useful for comparing the variability amplitudes of light curves in different energy bands from the same observation. Monte Carlo simulations are used to derive a description of the uncertainty in the amplitude expected between different energy bands (due to measurement errors). Finally, these estimators are used to demonstrate some variability properties of the bright Seyfert 1 galaxy Markarian 766. The source is found to show a strong, linear correlation between rms amplitude and flux, and to show significant spectral variability.}",

The X-ray spectrum is well-described by a model comprised of the continuum emission from the corona and its reflection from the accretion disc around a rapidly spinning (a \\&gt; 0.94) black hole. In order to model the broadband spectrum, it is necessary to account for the variation in ionization across the disc. Analysis of the X-ray spectrum in time periods before, during and after the flares reveals the underlying changes to the corona associated with the flaring. During the flares, the reflection fraction drops significantly, consistent with the acceleration of the corona away from the accretion disc. We find the first evidence that during the X-ray flares, the temperature drops from \\$140\_\\{-20\\}^\\{+100\\}\\$ keV before to \\$45\_\\{-9\\}^\\{+40\\}\\$ keV during the flares. The profile of the iron K line reveals the emissivity profile of the accretion disc, showing it to be illuminated by a compact corona extending no more than \\$7\_\\{-2\\}^\\{+4\\}\\$ rg over the disc before the flares, but with tentative evidence that the corona expands as it is accelerated during the flares. Once the flares subsided, the corona had collapsed to a radius of \\$6\_\\{-2\\}^\\{+2\\}\\$ rg. The rapid time-scale of the flares suggests that they arise within the black hole magnetosphere rather than in the accretion disc, and the variation of the corona is consistent with the continuum arising from the Comptonization of seed photons from the disc.}",

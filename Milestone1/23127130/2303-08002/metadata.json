    "abstract": "A modified extremal Reissner-Nordstrom geometry, void of singularities, is proposed in this work, by means of an exponential factor depending on a positive constant $k$. All the metric coefficients are positive and finite and the spacetime has no any horizon. The curvature invariants are regular at the origin of coordinates and at infinity. The energy conditions for the stress tensor associate to the imperfect fluid are investigated. The gravitational field presents repulsive properties near the gravitational radius associated to the mass $m$. With the choice $k = 1/m$, the Komar energy $W_{K}$ of the mass $m$ changes its sign at $r = λ$ ($λ$ is the Compton wavelength of $m$), when the classical energy $mc^{2}$ equals the energy $\\hbar c/r$.",

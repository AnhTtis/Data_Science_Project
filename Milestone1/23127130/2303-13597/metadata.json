    "abstract": "We study the dynamics of an 'electric' $\\mathcal{N}=1$ 3D $U(N_c)_{k,k+\\frac{N_c}{2}}$ SQCD theory. By embedding the theory in string theory, we propose that the theory admits a 'magnetic' dual and analyse the low energy dynamics of the theory using its dual. When $\\frac{N_f}{2} \\ge\\frac{N_c}{2}-k$ the IR dynamics is described by either a TQFT for large quark masses, or a Grassmanian and a Wess-Zumino (WZ) term for small masses. We also consider non-supersymmetric mass deformations and RG flows in the vicinity of the SUSY point and find agreement between the IR of the electric and its magnetic dual. When $\\frac{N_f}{2} < \\frac{N_c}{2}-k$ supersymmetry is broken and the IR dynamics is a described by a TQFT accompanied by a Goldstino. We also discuss SQCD theories based on $SO$/$USp$ gauge groups.",

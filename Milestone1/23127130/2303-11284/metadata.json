    "abstract": "We introduce a new method with spectral accuracy to solve linear non-autonomous ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of the kind $ \\frac{d}{dt}\\tilde{u}(t) = \\tilde{f}(t) \\tilde{u}(t)$, $\\tilde{u}(-1)=1$, with $\\tilde{f}(t)$ an analytic function. The method is based on a new expression for the solution $\\tilde{u}(t)$ given in terms of a convolution-like operation, the $\\star$-product. This expression is represented in a finite Legendre polynomial basis translating the initial problem into a matrix problem. An efficient procedure is proposed to approximate the Legendre coefficients of $\\tilde{u}(t)$ and its truncation error is analyzed. We show the effectiveness of the proposed procedure through some numerical experiments. The method can be easily generalized to solve systems of linear ODEs.",

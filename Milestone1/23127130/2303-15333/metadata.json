    "abstract": "The main purpose of this short note is to derive some generalizations of the classical long neck principle and give a spectral width inequality of geodesic collar neighborhood. Our results are obtained via the spinorial Callias operator approach. An important step is to introduce the relative Gromov-Lawson pair on a compact manifold with boundary, relative to a background manifold.",

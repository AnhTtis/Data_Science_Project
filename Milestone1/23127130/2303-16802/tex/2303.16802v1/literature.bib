ANM leads to a representation of a solution path in terms of series or Pad{\'e} approximants. To get a smooth solution path, a hyperbolic relation between contact forces and clearance is introduced. Three key points are discussed: the influence of the regularization of the contact law, the discretization of the contact force by Lagrange multipliers and prediction--correction algorithms.

interfaces formed from cast-iron surfaces which are subjected to a combination of normal and shear forces. Because

of the relatively small deflections, an experimental procedure is adopted which enables a number of interfaces to be

considered in series, thereby increasing the resolution of a single measurement and averaging out small topological

differences between nominally identical surfaces.

The range of parameters investigated covers those which are used in current design practice. The combination of

machined surfaces include ground on ground and hand-scraped on ground. These surfaces were subjected to normal

pressures up to 9 x 105 Nm-2 and the resulting characteristics are represented in graphical form.},

 abstract = {Sector-to-sector geometry or material property variations in as-manufactured bladed disks, or blisks, can result in significantly greater vibration responses during operation compared to nominally cyclic symmetric designs. The dynamics of blisks are sensitive to these unavoidable deviations, known as mistuning, making the identification of mistuning in as-manufactured blisks necessary for accurately predicting their vibration. As in previous mistuning modeling and identification approaches, the mistuning of interest is small and is parameterized by using deviations in cantilever blade-alone frequencies. Such mistuning parameterization is popular because it can be applied through blade-to-blade stiffness deviations in computational reduced-order models used to predict blisk dynamics. Previous approaches to identify such mistuning parameters often require the identification of modal information or blade-isolation techniques such as blade detuning using masses or adding damping pads. However, modal information can be difficult to obtain accurately even in optimal bench conditions. In addition, in practice it can be difficult to isolate individual blades by restricting blade motion around the blisk or detuning individual blades through added masses due to geometric constraints. In this article, we present a method for mistuning identification using a data-driven approach based on a neural network. The network is first trained using surrogate computational data. Thus, the data-driven portion of the approach is executed using surrogate computational methods. With the trained network, mistuning in all sectors of blisks with the same nominal geometry can be identified by using a small number of forced responses and the forcing phase information from traveling-wave excitation. In this approach, no system or sector-level modal response information, restrictive blade isolation, or mass detuning are required. We additionally present a method for forcing frequency selection and response conditioning to improve identification accuracy. Validation of this approach is presented using a finite element blisk model containing stiffness mistuning within the blades to create computationally generated surrogate data. It is shown that mistuning can be predicted accurately using forced responses containing a significant amount of absolute and relative measurement noise, mimicking responses collected from experimental measurements. In addition, it is shown that mistuning can be predicted independently and accurately using different engine orders of excitation in regions of high modal density.},

 abstract = {The contribution discusses a model update procedure and its experimental validation in the context of blisk mistuning. Object of investigation is an industrial test blisk of an axial compressor which is milled from solid using a state of the art 5-axis milling machine. First, the blisk geometry is digitized by a blue light fringe projector. Digitization is largely automated using an industrial robot cell in order to guarantee high repeatability of the measurement results. Additionally, frequency mistuning patterns are identified based on vibration measurements. Here, the system excitation is realized by a modal impact hammer. The blade response is detected using a laser scanning vibrometer. Furthermore, all blades except the currently excited one are detuned with additional masses. Applying these masses allows to identify a blade dominated natural frequency for each blade and every mode of interest. Finally, these blade dominated frequencies are summarized to mode specific mistuning patterns. The key part of the contribution presents a model update approach which is focused on small geometric deviations between real engine parts and idealized simulation models. Within this update procedure the nodal coordinates of an initially tuned finite element blisk model were modified in order to match the geometry of the real part measured by blue light fringe projection. All essential pre- and post-processing steps of the mesh morphing procedure are described and illustrated. It could be proven that locally remaining geometric deviations between updated finite element model and the optical measurement results are below 5 \textgreek{m}m. For the purpose of validation blade dominated natural frequencies of the updated finite element blisk model are calculated for each sector up to a frequency of 17 kHz. Finally, the numerically predicted mistuning patterns are compared against the experimentally identified counterparts. At this point a very good agreement between experimentally identified and numerically predicted mistuning patterns can be proven across several mode families. Even mistuning patterns of higher modes at about 17 kHz are well predicted by the geometrically mistuned finite element model. Within the last section of the paper, possible uncertainties of the presented model update procedure are analyzed. As a part of the study the digitization of the investigated blisk has been repeated for ten times. These measurement results serve as input for the model update procedure described before. In the context of this investigation ten independent geometrical mistuned simulation models are created and the corresponding mistuning patterns are calculated.},

 abstract = {This effort focuses on the comparison of unsteadiness due to as-measured turbine blades in a transonic turbine to that obtained with blueprint geometries via computational fluid dynamics (CFD). A Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes flow solver with the two-equation Wilcox turbulence model is used as the numerical analysis tool for comparison between the blueprint geometries and as-manufactured geometries obtained from a structured light optical measurement system. The nominal turbine CFD grid data defined for analysis of the blueprint blade was geometrically modified to reflect as-manufactured turbine blades using an established mesh metamorphosis algorithm. The approach uses a modified neural network to iteratively update the source mesh to the target mesh. In this case the source is the interior CFD surface grid while the target is the surface blade geometry obtained from the optical scanner. Nodes interior to the CFD surface were updated using a modified iterative spring analogy to avoid grid corruption when matching as-manufactured part geometry. This approach avoids the tedious manual approach of regenerating the CFD grid and does not rely on geometry obtained from Coordinate Measurement Machine (CMM) sections, but rather a point cloud representing the entirety of the turbine blade. Surface pressure traces and the discrete Fourier transforms thereof from numerical predictions of as-measured geometries are then compared both to blueprint predictions and to experimental measurements. The importance of incorporating as-measured geometries in analyses to explain deviations between numerical predictions of blueprint geometries and experimental results is readily apparent. Further analysis of every casting produced in the creation of the test turbine yields variations that one can expect in both aero-performance and unsteady loading as a consequence of manufacturing tolerances. Finally, the use of measured airfoil geometries to reduce the unsteady load on a target blade in a region of interest is successfully demonstrated.},

Indeed, whereas the system to analyze is considered as a black box, the accurate modeling of the relationship between its input and output is the aim of the proposed techniques. In this framework, the paper deals with two different methodologies for the system identification of thermal problems. The first identifies a linear thermal system by means of an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The approach starts from an a priori guessed analytical model whose expression is assumed to describe appropriately the response of the system to identify. Then, the EKF is used for estimating the model transient states and parameters. However, this methodology is not extended to the processing of nonlinear systems due to the difficulty related to the analytical model construction step. Therefore, a second approach is presented, based on an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). Finally, a Finite Element (FE) model is used as a reference, and the good agreement between the FE results and the responses produced by the EKF and UKF methods in the linear case fully illustrate their interest. {\copyright} The Society for Experimental Mechanics 2014.},

This work is concerned with developing a vibration-based energy harvester with a tunable natural frequency. The harvester is designed to automatically adjust its own natural frequency to match that of the imposed base excitation. The proposed device consists of a cantilever beam carrying a tip mass in the form of a magnet which is placed in close proximity to another magnet with opposite polarity that can move axially thereby adjusting the beam's natural frequency by mechanical straining. The system is designed to autonomously adjust the gap between the two magnets so as to achieve a harvester whose natural frequency matches that of the excitation. As such, the movable magnet is mounted on a motor-driven tray that undergoes linear motion and adjusts its position in accordance with the frequency of the support motion. The base motion frequency is detected by an electromagnetic means, wherein another magnet, fixed to the base, moves past a stationary coil generating an electric signal. The signal is conditioned through a microprocessor to detect its frequency and is then used to determine the favorable gap between the tuning magnets to achieve resonance from a lookup table. Based on the findings of this work, the natural frequency of the harvester is successfully tuned from 4.7 Hz to 9.0 Hz generating voltage per acceleration from 6.3 V/m/s2 to 1.1 V/m/s2, respectively.},

The considered systems are the space-discretized continuous systems obtained by using a Finite Element Method (FEM) approach or the multi-body systems, or a mix of them as in flexible multibody dynamics. Up to now, two main numerical schemes are available for this purpose: the Moreau--Jean scheme which solves the constraints at the velocity level together with a Newton impact law and the Schatzman--Paoli scheme which directly considers the constraints at the position level. In both schemes, the position and velocity constraints are not both satisfied in discrete time. A first attempt to improve the time simulation is made by directly using the Gear--Gupta--Leimkuhler (GGL) approach for Differential Algebraic Equations (DAE), that solves, in discrete time, the constraints on both position and velocity levels. This obtained direct projection scheme succeeds in solving in discrete time both position and velocity constraints, but introduces some chattering at contact after a finite accumulation of impacts. A second new scheme is proposed that improves the direct projected scheme by combining several steps of activation and projection to avoid the chattering effect. The stability and the local order of the scheme will be discussed. The usefulness of the scheme is demonstrated on several academic examples and is illustrated on an industrial application: the modeling and simulation of an electrical circuit breaker.},

@article{Adams.1999,
 abstract = {Frequency response function matrices relate the inputs and the outputs of structural dynamic systems. If a system is linear the frequency response function matrix is the same for any combination or types of inputs over the entire operating range. Furthermore, the frequency response matrix of a linear vibrating system is a simple combination of temporal and spatial characteristics, the modal frequencies, modal vectors and modal scale factors. When a system is non-linear, the inputs interact through an exchange of energy between the linear and non-linear elements in the system. No general combination of the temporal and spatial non-linear characteristics has to date been proposed to describe these linear--non-linear interactions. This article introduces a unifying perspective of non-linearities as internal feedback forces that act together with the external forces to generate the response of the non-linear system. This perspective of the non-linearities is spatial in nature and leads to two simple but conceptually powerful relationships between the frequency response function matrix of a non-linear multiple-degree-of-freedom system and its linear counterpart. Several single- and multiple-degree-of-freedom systems are used to demonstrate the use and interpretation of these relationships. The broad implication of the new input--output frequency response representation for both linear and non-linear systems are also addressed. In particular, the merits of the spatial perspective of non-linear systems and the new frequency response relationships are stated in the context of linear and non-linear system characterization and identification. One implication is that these relationships suggest there is an input--output-dependent temporal-spatial (modal) decomposition of the frequency response function matrix for non-linear systems.},

The authors have previously used feedback to derive a new formulation of frequency response function matrices of non-linear systems, which are described as modulations of nominal linear systems. The modulation creates a pseudo-separation of the linear and non-linear dynamics of the system. The present article derives a new method for estimating parameters of non-linear parametric models that uses internal feedback to account for non-linearities. The main advantage of the new formulation of non-linear system identification is its simplicity. Moreover, the method estimates the linear frequency response matrix and non-linear system parameters at forced and unforced degrees of freedom of general multiple-degree-of-freedom non-linear systems simultaneously. This article demonstrates the implementation of this method on simulated data from single- and multiple-degree-of-freedom lumped parameter models.},

 abstract = {This dissertation reports a systematic study on analysis and identification of multiple parameter damped

mechanical systems. The attention is focused on viscously and non-viscously damped multiple degree-offreedom

linear vibrating systems. The non-viscous damping model is such that the damping forces depend

on the past history of motion via convolution integrals over some kernel functions. The familiar viscous

damping model is a special case of this general linear damping model when the kernel functions have no

memory.

The concept of proportional damping is critically examined and a generalized form of proportional

damping is proposed. It is shown that the proportional damping can exist even when the damping mechanism

is non-viscous.

Classical modal analysis is extended to deal with general non-viscously damped multiple degree-offreedom

linear dynamic systems. The new method is similar to the existing method with some modifications

due to non-viscous effect of the damping mechanism. The concept of (complex) elastic modes and nonviscous

modes have been introduced and numerical methods are suggested to obtain them. It is further

shown that the system response can be obtained exactly in terms of these modes. Mode orthogonality

relationships, known for undamped or viscously damped systems, have been generalized to non-viscously

damped systems. Several useful results which relate the modes with the system matrices are developed.

These theoretical developments on non-viscously damped systems, in line with classical modal analysis,

give impetus towards understanding damping mechanisms in general mechanical systems. Based on a

first-order perturbation method, an approach is suggested to the identify non-proportional viscous damping

matrix from the measured complex modes and frequencies. This approach is then further extended to identify

non-viscous damping models. Both the approaches are simple, direct, and can be used with incomplete

modal data.

It is observed that these methods yield non-physical results by breaking the symmetry of the fitted

damping matrix when the damping mechanism of the original system is significantly different from what is

fitted. To solve this problem, approaches are suggested to preserve the symmetry of the identified viscous

and non-viscous damping matrix.

The damping identification methods are applied experimentally to a beam in bending vibration with

localized constrained layer damping. Since the identification method requires complex modal data, a general

method for identification of complex modes and complex frequencies from a set of measured transfer

functions have been developed. It is shown that the proposed methods can give useful information about

the true damping mechanism of the beam considered for the experiment. Further, it is demonstrated that

the damping identification methods are likely to perform quite well even for the case when noisy data is

obtained.

The work conducted here clarifies some fundamental issues regarding damping in linear dynamic systems

and develops efficient methods for analysis and identification of generally damped linear systems.},

In all these works, it has been assumed that exact complex natural frequencies and complex modes are known. In reality, this will not be the case. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the sensitivity of the identified damping matrices to measurement errors. By using numerical and analytical studies it is shown that the proposed methods can indeed be expected to give useful results from moderately noisy data provided a correct damping model is selected for fitting. Indications are also given of what level of noise in the measured modal properties is needed to mask the true physical behaviour.},

 abstract = {Identification of damping is an active area of research in structural dynamics. In one of the earliest works, Lancaster [1] proposed a method to identify the viscous damping matrix from measured natural frequencies and mode shapes. His method requires the modes to be normalized in a particular way, which in turn a priori needs the very same viscous damping matrix. A method, based on the poles and residues of the measured transfer functions, has been proposed to overcome this basic difficulty associated with Lancaster's method. This approach is then extended to a class of nonviscously damped systems where the damping forces depend on the past history of the velocities via convolution integrals over some kernel functions. Suitable numerical examples are given to illustrate the modified Lancaster's method developed here.},

 abstract = {A current trend in the aeronautic industry is to increase the wing aspect ratio to enhance aerodynamic efficiency by reducing the induced drag and thus reduce fuel consumption. Despite the associated benefits of a large aspect ratio, such as higher lift-to-drag ratios and range, commercial aircraft usually have a relatively low aspect ratio. This is partially explained by the fact that the wing becomes more flexible with increasing aspect ratio and thus more prone to large deflections, which can cause aeroelastic instability problems such as flutter. In this work, an aeroelastic study is conducted on a rectangular wing model of 20 m span and variable chord for a low subsonic speed condition to evaluate the differences between linear and non-linear static aeroelastic responses. Comparisons between linear and non-linear displacements, natural frequencies and flutter boundary are performed. An in-house non-linear aeroelastic framework was employed for this purpose. In this work, the influence of the aspect ratio and geometric non-linearity (highly deformed states) is assessed in terms of aeroelastic performance parameters: flutter speed and divergence speed. A nearly linear correlation of flutter speed difference (relative to linear analysis results) with vertical-tip displacement difference is observed. The flutter and divergence speeds vary substantially as the wing aspect ratio increases, and the divergence speeds always remain above the flutter speed. Furthermore, the flutter mechanism was observed to change as the wing chord is decreased. {\copyright} Copyright 2017 Royal Aeronautical Society.},

 abstract = {Rotating machinery may experience severe vibration due to a sudden unbalance caused by the loss of a rotating

blade. A subsequent emergency shutdown of the engine is the consequence. In general, the magnitude of the

transient vibration during the run-down will be larger than the clearances between the rotating and the stationary

parts and thus, contact between the blade tips or the shaft surface with the inner casing wall will occur. The

severity of the rubbing is strongly influenced by the actual running speed, i. e. a passage through the resonances

will amplify the shaft vibration and affects therefore the rotor-stator rubs.

The present work deals with the question which design parameters of a stationary gas-turbine have the most

significant impact on the rub forces in case of large unbalance. This requires a detailed numerical simulation of the

transient nonlinear dynamical behavior of the gas-turbine. For this purpose, a finite element model of the shaft and

the casing was derived. Blade rubbing at the compressor and the turbine stages as well as rubbing at the location

of radial sealings is considered. During the simulation radial contact forces are calculated by a force-deformation

relation allowing for multiple blade rubs. Tangential rubbing forces are determined subsequently by applying a

high-speed friction model particularly derived for this purpose.

In order to obtain a realistic response of the journal bearings on the large bearing pin deflection, the bearings have

been modelled by introducing a nonlinear cylindrical bearing characteristic.

To obtain reasonable simulation times the component mode synthesis has been applied to reduce the number of

degrees of freedom of the rotor-casing finite element model.},

Different contact models are available in literature. These models make use of contact parameters, contact stiffness and friction coefficient to evaluate the damping and stiffness related to the contact interfaces. In this paper a model is proposed to characterize friction contact of non-spherical contact geometries obeying the Coulomb friction law with constant friction coefficient and constant normal load. The hysteresis curves of the oscillating tangential contact forces vs. relative tangential displacements and the dissipated energy at the contact are obtained for different contact geometries.

 abstract = {Substructure coupling techniques allow one to predict the response of an assembly from dynamic models for each subcomponent. Linear substructures are routinely used in analysis (e.g. the Craig-Bampton method) to reduce the computational cost of vibration, noise and load predictions for structures. They also provide a designer with insight into the influence that each subcomponent has on the assembled system's natural frequencies, mode shapes and damping. These concepts are currently limited to assemblies of linear substructures. This work explores substructuring with nonlinear subcomponents (substructures), using the nonlinear normal modes of each substructure to seek to understand how those contribute to the nonlinear modes of the assembly. The goal is to extend the insights that have been developed over the past several years for linear substructures, to nonlinear ones. A specific type of describing function model, which captures the variation of the structure's natural frequencies and mode shapes with energy is introduced, which is here dubbed a Representative Linear Modal Model (RLMM). The results show that this type of model can be used with linear substructuring techniques to effectively predict the dynamics of a nonlinear assembly, suggesting that linear substructuring concepts may be applied advantageously to nonlinear assemblies. {\copyright} The Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc. 2012.},

 abstract = {This work proposes a means whereby weak nonlinearity in a substructure, as typically arises due to friction in bolted interfaces, can be captured experimentally on a mode-by-mode basis and then used to predict the nonlinear response of an assembly. The method relies on the fact that the modes of a weakly nonlinear structure tend to remain uncoupled so long as their natural frequencies are distinct and higher harmonics generated by the nonlinearity do not produce significant response in other modes. Recent experiments on industrial hardware with bolted joints has shown that this type of model can be quite effective, and that a single degree-of-freedom (DOF) system with an Iwan joint, which is known as a modal Iwan model, effectively captures the way in which the stiffness and damping depend on amplitude. Once the modal Iwan models have been identified for each mode of the subcomponent(s) of interest, they can be assembled using standard techniques and used with a numerical integration routine to compute the nonlinear transient response of the assembled structure. The proposed methods are demonstrated by coupling a modal model of a 3DOF system with three discrete Iwan joints to a linear model for a 2DOF system.},

However, the complexity of such reduced order models grows cubically with the number of linear modes in the basis set, making complicated geometries prohibitively expensive to compute. Component mode synthesis techniques may be used to reduce this cost by assembling a set of smaller nonlinear subcomponent models, each of which can be more quickly computed than a nonlinear model of the entire structure. Since geometric nonlinearity is heavily dependent on each structure's boundary conditions, however, subcomponents of an assembly which are constrained only at their interfaces -- such as panels mounted to an underlying frame -- prove difficult to treat using existing nonlinear modeling techniques. This work uses Craig-Bampton dynamic substructuring combined with characteristic constraint modes for interface reduction to examine the challenges associated with panel and frame assemblies, with a simple example motivating a discussion of current solutions and future challenges.},

Presented at the international modal analysis conference XXXV, Garden Grove, 2017), {\textquotedbl}Substructuring of a nonlinear beam using modal Iwan framework, Part I: Nonlinear Modal Model Identification{\textquotedbl}, nonlinear modal models are constructed for an experimental substructure that represent the dynamics using a set of uncoupled weakly nonlinear modes. This assumes that the linear modes of the structure remain uncoupled so that the nonlinearity can be described in a mode by mode fashion. These nonlinear modal models can be used to simulate the response of the experimental system. This paper demonstrates the use of these models to represent a substructure in an experimental-analytical substructuring prediction. The authors utilize the transmission simulator method on the experimentally derived models to generate predictions of a modified Brake-Reuss Beam system. The substructuring predictions are then compared to a truth test data set to validate the method. To further understand the limitations of the method and its sensitivity to measurement noise, the modal substructuring approach is also simulated on a finite element model of the beam that contains three discrete nonlinear elements to represent the joint.},

 abstract = {In order to increase the aerodynamic performances of

their engines, aircraft engine manufacturers try to minimize

the clearance between rotating and stationary parts in ax-

ial and centrifugal compressors. Consequently, the proba-

bility of contact increases, leading to undesirable phenom-

ena caused by forced excitation of the natural modes, or by

modal interaction. Due to the complexity of these phenom-

ena, many numerical studies have been conducted to gain

a better understanding of the physics associated with them,

looking primarily at their respective influence on potential

unstable behaviors. However, the influence of other physi-

cal phenomena, such as friction and wear, remains poorly

understood. The aim of this work is to show some effects

associated with friction and wear on the dynamic behavior

resulting from blade-to-casing interaction.

The numerical study reported here is based on a sim-

plified finite element model of a rotating bladed disk and

a flexible casing. The contact algorithm uses an ex-

plicit time marching scheme with the Lagrange multipliers

method. Friction and wear are formulated using respectively

Coulomb's and Archard's Laws. The rotational speed is set

to critical speed giving rise to modal interaction between a

backward mode of the casing and a counter-rotating mode of

the bladed disk with one nodal diameter. Contact is initiated

by a dynamic excitation of the stator.

In the presence of friction, the system becomes unstable when a sideband of the excitation frequency coincides

with a one nodal diameter mode of the bladed disk. The

introduction of wear leads to a vibration reduction, while

the abradable material is removed by the wear process. The

number of wear lobes produced on the casing is related to

the ratio between the vibration frequency of the blades and

the rotating speed. The ratio obtained by means of the FE

model corroborates experimental observations.},

A more accurate method has been developed (InTerPart MIcroslip COntact method in [1]) to represent the damping introduced by these kind of friction sources. An improvement of this method has been made taking into account a more-in-depth study of the influence of normal stresses in those contacts areas under high normal stresses and small displacements (using the blade attachment friction source as reference).

The paper includes a detailed study of the sensitiveness of different blade attachments to different normal stress distribution along the contact face, and the influence of this distribution in damping results.

 abstract = {In this paper a highly asymmetric, lightweight, vibro-impact non-linear energy sink (NES) leading to very efficient passive non-linear targeted energy transfer (TET) is investigated. To this end, a two degree-of-freedom linear system (the primary structure) is coupled to a single-sided vibro-impact (VI) attachment with highly asymmetric impact non-linearity (the VI NES). The proposed NES passively absorbs and rapidly dissipates a considerable amount of the impulse energy induced into the linear structure, leading to very effective shock mitigation compared to a double-sided (symmetric) VI NES. We find that appropriate selection of the weak linear stiffness that couples the non-linear VI attachment to the linear structure plays a significant role in the proposed design. Moreover, in contrast to the double-sided VI NES which has optimal performance for a narrow range of input energies, the proposed single-sided asymmetric VI NES maintains a high level of performance over a broad range of high input energies. Hence, the proposed design is especially suitable for severe shock mitigation in infrastructure. To quantify the enhanced shock mitigation performance of the asymmetric VI NES we employ measures of effective damping and stiffness developed in previous works to demonstrate that the primary structure with attached NES possesses drastically increased effective damping and stiffness compared to its nominal properties when no NES is attached. A series of experimental results fully validates the theoretical predictions. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The nonlinear frequency of the conservative nonlinear oscillator is dependent on the initial energy induced into the system. However, for the non-conservative and purely nonlinear oscillator, the instantaneous frequency is dependent on the instantaneous energy of the system. Consequently, the exact amplitude decay formula obtained in a recent publication for such oscillator is accurately applied here to obtain an accurate analytical formula for the time-varying frequency of the considered system. Excellent agreement between the results obtained by the new time-varying frequency formula presented here and both numerical simulation and wavelet transform has been clearly observed.

 abstract = {In fatigue reliability assessments, the random load process is commonly represented by its marginal distribution (load spectrum) only. However, as shown in this paper, the correlation characteristics of the load process can have a strong influence on the fatigue reliability and should be accounted for. The paper reviews the modeling of random fatigue crack growth under variable amplitude loading for reliability analysis. Solutions for fatigue crack growth evaluation at different levels of detailing are described and a fatigue crack growth and failure evaluation algorithm, based on a discretization of the random stress process, is presented. As an alternative, a mean approximation is described. Finally, effective computational methods for assessing the fatigue reliability under variable amplitude loading are introduced and applied exemplarily to a case study. The solutions are based on the first-order reliability method FORM and the subset simulation. Using a Markov process model of the loads, the influence of different types of service histories is investigated, by varying the correlation length of the stress cycle process. The results show that the correlation length of the load process has significant influence on the resulting reliability; the resulting probability of failure can vary up to several orders of magnitude for the same marginal probability distribution of stress amplitudes. Based on the results of the case study, the influences of the stress process correlation and of the adopted failure criteria on the reliability are discussed. The mean approximation and the random variable model of the random load process are demonstrated to be applicable under specific conditions. {\copyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

 abstract = {Experimental data clearly show a strong and nonlinear dependence of damping from the maximum vibration amplitude reached in a cycle for macro- and microstructural elements. This dependence takes a completely different level with respect to the frequency shift of resonances due to nonlinearity, which is commonly of 10--25{\%} at most for shells, plates and beams. The experiments show that a damping value over six times larger than the linear one must be expected for vibration of thin plates when the vibration amplitude is about twice the thickness. This is a huge change! The present study derives accurately, for the first time, the nonlinear damping from a fractional viscoelastic standard solid model by introducing geometric nonlinearity in it. The damping model obtained is nonlinear, and its frequency dependence can be tuned by the fractional derivative to match the material behaviour. The solution is obtained for a nonlinear single-degree-of-freedom system by harmonic balance. Numerical results are compared to experimental forced vibration responses measured for large-amplitude vibrations of a rectangular plate (hardening system), a circular cylindrical panel (softening system) and a clamped rod made of zirconium alloy (weak hardening system). Sets of experiments have been obtained at different harmonic excitation forces. Experimental results present a very large damping increase with the peak vibration amplitude, and the model is capable of reproducing them with very good accuracy.},

a collection of point masses with rotational inertia. Furthermore, the body deformations are described

with respect to a body-fixed coordinate frame. The coupling between the flexible body deformation

the body flexibility. In particular, if the finite element method is chosen for this purpose only the

standard finite element parameters obtained from any commercial finite element code are used in

the methodology. In this manner, not only the analyst can use any type of finite elements in the

multibody model but the same finite element model can be used to evaluate the structural integrity

it is necessary to reduce the number of generalized coordinates to a reasonable dimension. This is

achieved with the component mode synthesis at the cost of specializing the formulation to flexible

multibody models experiencing linear elastic deformations only. Structural damping is introduced to

achieve better numerical performance without compromising the quality of the results. The motions

 abstract = {SUMMARY A new approach for the dimensional reduction via projection of nonlinear computational models based on the concept of local reduced-order bases is presented. It is particularly suited for problems characterized by different physical regimes, parameter variations, or moving features such as discontinuities and fronts. Instead of approximating the solution of interest in a fixed lower-dimensional subspace of global basis vectors, the proposed model order reduction method approximates this solution in a lower-dimensional subspace generated by most appropriate local basis vectors. To this effect, the solution space is partitioned into subregions, and a local reduced-order basis is constructed and assigned to each subregion offline. During the incremental solution online of the reduced problem, a local basis is chosen according to the subregion of the solution space where the current high-dimensional solution lies. This is achievable in real time because the computational complexity of the selection algorithm scales with the dimension of the lower-dimensional solution space. Because it is also applicable to the process of hyper reduction, the proposed method for nonlinear model order reduction is computationally efficient. Its potential for achieving large speedups while maintaining good accuracy is demonstrated for two nonlinear computational fluid and fluid-structure-electric interaction problems.

 abstract = {We study a peculiar damped nonlinear transition of a system of two coupled oscillators into a state of sustained nonlinear resonance scattering. This system consists of a grounded, weakly damped linear oscillator attached to a light, weakly damped oscillator with essential (nonlinearizable) stiffness nonlinearity of the third degree, and linear or nonlinear damping. We find that under specific forcing conditions the damped response of this system locks into a damped, non-resonant transition resembling continuous resonance scattering, whereby the transient damped dynamics closely follows an impulsive orbit manifold of the dynamics in the frequencyenergy plane. This manifold is formed by a countable infinity of periodic orbits and an uncountable infinity of quasi-periodic orbits of the underlying Hamiltonian system, with each of these orbits representing the response of the Hamiltonian system being initially at rest and forced by an impulse applied to the linear oscillator. Hence, the damped transitions reported here appear to lock in sustained resonance scattering from a countable infinity of periodic orbits along the impulsive orbit manifold. Such transitions represent an anti-resonance state, where the dynamics is farthest away from resonance. We conjecture that such transitions are only made possible by the essential (nonlinearizable) stiffness nonlinearity of the nonlinear attachment and cannot be realized in linearizable nonlinear dynamics where resonance captures prevent sustained resonance scattering. Our findings are supported by numerical, analytical and experimental results. {\copyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We show that the effects of nonlinear damping are far from being purely parasitic and introduce new dynamics when compared to the corresponding systems with linear damping. The dynamics is analyzed by performing a slow/fast decomposition leading to slow flows, which in turn are used to study transient instability caused by a bifurcation to 1:3 resonance capture. In addition, a new dynamical phenomenon of continuous resonance scattering is observed that is both persistent and prevalent for the case of the nonlinearly damped system: For certain moderate excitations, the transient dynamics {\textquotedbl}tracks{\textquotedbl} a manifold of impulsive orbits, in effect transitioning between multiple resonance captures over definitive frequency and energy ranges.

 abstract = {This paper describes an experimental investigation into the dynamic stiffness characteristics of flat joints subjected to an alternating force superimposed on a steady pre-load. The joints consist of the interfaces between mils-steel discs arranged in a column, in sets with surfaces either turned or lapped together. The influences of pre-load and of alternating force frequency were investigated for both dry and oiled joints, for different values of surface finish, apparent joint area and oil visocosity. The ranges of the conditions considered are compatible with those existing in typical machine tool structures.It was found that the dynamic stiffness of dry joints is independent of frequency and no energy dissipation is measurable. The stiffness is primarly a function of pre-load and surface finish, with appearent joint area becoming important only for very good surface finishes.If oil is introduced into the joint interface, a quadrature stiffness component arises and is accompanied by an increase in the `in-phase' stiffness component. The magnitudes of the oil film stiffness components decrease sharply with an increase in the effective oil film thickness, which is governed primarily by the surface roughness. They increase with oil viscosity, the apparent joint area and the frequency of vibration, and represent a potentially valuable source of vibration damping in engineering structures.Fig. 22.1. caption: Arrangement of the joint columnFig. 22.2. caption: Distribution of contact between the joint surfaces---large rough jointFig. 22.3. caption: Experimental rigFig. 22.4. caption: Variation of stiffness with pre-loadFig. 22.5. caption: Variation of stiffness with pre-load; effect of apparnet joint area and surface finishFig. 22.6. caption: Variation of stiffness amplitude and phase angle with pre-loadFig. 22.7. caption: Variation of stiffness components with frequencyFig. 22.8. caption: Variation of stiffness components with pre-loadFig. 22.9. caption: Variation of stiffness components with pre-load, effect of viscosityFig. 22.10. caption: Theoretical model.

flexible stator developed in a rotating frame is introduced. The

interaction between the rotating and stationary parts is adjusted

using the gas flow in the straight-through labyrinth seal located

on the tip of the blades. This is therefore an ''aero elastic contact''

problem. An energy-based method is used to express the

equations of motion. The computation of eigenvalues provides

the Campbell diagram and information on stability. A singlecontrol-

volume analysis is performed to predict the destabilizing

force exerted by the labyrinth seal.

In terms of strategy a simpler and efficient model with a rigid

rotating shaft is compared with models found in the literature

before the complete rotor - stator aero elastic contact study is

presented. This is followed by a study of the interaction between

the bladed disk with a labyrinth seal and the flexible stator.

The model proposed provides a new approach to modelling

rotor systems with labyrinth seals. The stator is then modelled

as a flexible body and the rotor as a bladed disk. It is shown in

the example described that the stability of the system depends on

the rigid body movement of the stator and is independent of its

nodal diameter modes.},

 abstract = {The presence of cracks in a structure is usually detected by adopting a linear approach through the monitoring of changes in its dynamic response features, such as natural frequencies and mode shapes. But these linear vibration procedures do not always come up to practical results because of their inherently low sensitivity to defects. Since a crack introduces non-linearities in the system, their use in damage detection merits to be investigated. With this aim the present paper is devoted to analysing the peculiar features of the non-linear response of a cracked beam.

The problem of a cantilever beam with an asymmetric edge crack subjected to a harmonic forcing at the tip is considered as a plane problem and is solved by using two-dimensional finite elements; the behaviour of the breathing crack is simulated as a frictionless contact problem. The modification of the response with respect to the linear one is outlined: in particular, excitation of sub- and super-harmonics, period doubling, and quasi-impulsive behaviour at crack interfaces are the main achievements. These response characteristics, strictly due to the presence of a crack, can be used in non-linear techniques of crack identification.},

An arrangement that favours the solution of this problem is the interposition of bumpers. Thus, the influence of geometrical and mechanical characteristics of isolation and mitigation devices on nonlinear non-smooth response of vibro-impact systems is experimentally and numerically investigated in this paper on the basis of a laboratory campaign of experimental tests and a numerical model. Shaking table tests are carried out under a harmonic excitation in order to investigate two different configurations: the absence and the presence of bumpers. For different values of the table acceleration peak are applied, four different amplitude values of the total gap between mass and bumpers are considered, and also four different types of bumpers are employed. The experimental response of the system is analysed in terms of table acceleration, gap clearance, bumpers' stiffness, and pseudo-resonance frequency; a suitable normalization is adopted in order to better interpret experimental results; in particular, mass acceleration is normalized with respect to table acceleration and excursion is normalized with respect to gap. The signals of the system's response are appropriately elaborated to verify the possibility of modifying the system's response and direct it towards the (conflicting) objectives desired to simultaneously reduce displacements and accelerations. A suitable model has been developed to numerically simulate the behaviour of the system by using a general-purpose computer code, achieving a good agreement with the experimental results.},

evolution of UAVs has given rise to increasingly smaller aircraft. Along with the development of smaller UAVs, termed

mini UAVs, has come issues involving the endurance of the aircraft. Endurance in mini UAVs is problematic because of

the limited size of the fuel systems that can be incorporated into the aircraft. A large portion of the total mass of many

electric powered mini UAVs, for example, is the rechargeable battery power source. Energy harvesting is an attractive

technology for mini UAVs because it offers the potential to increase their endurance without adding significant mass or

the need to increase the size of the fuel system. This paper investigates the possibility of harvesting vibration and solar

energy in a mini UAV. Experimentation has been carried out on a remote controlled (RC) glider aircraft with a 1.8 m

wing span. This aircraft was chosen to replicate the current electric mini UAVs used by the military today. The RC

glider was modified to include two piezoelectric patches placed at the roots of the wings and a cantilevered piezoelectric

beam installed in the fuselage to harvest energy from wing vibrations and rigid body motions of the aircraft, as well as

two thin film photovoltaic panels attached to the top of the wings to harvest energy from sunlight. Flight testing has

been performed and the power output of the piezoelectric and photovoltaic devices has been examined.},

The approach is a nonlinear extension of the fixed-interface component mode synthesis (CMS) technique developed for linear structures by Hurty and modified by Craig and Bampton. Specifically, the case of nonlinear substructures is handled by using fixed-interface nonlinear normal modes (NNMs). These normal modes are constructed for the various substructures using an invariant manifold approach, and are then coupled through the traditional linear constraint modes (i.e., the static deformation shapes produced by unit interface displacements). A class of systems is used to demonstrate the concept and show the effectiveness of the proposed procedure. Simulation results show that the reduced-order model (ROM) obtained from the proposed procedure outperforms the ROM obtained from the classical fixed-interface linear CMS approach as applied to a nonlinear structure. The proposed method is readily applicable to large-scale nonlinear structural systems that are based on finite-element models.},

Impact force models are used to determine the responses of contacting solids. The selection of the impact force model strongly affects the predictions of the dynamic behavior of the contacting bodies, mainly in sequential repeated impacts. In this work, the strong nonlinear dynamic behavior of a cantilever steel beam, repeatedly impacting a steel rigid stop, is investigated applying experimental and numerical methodologies. The applicability of a nonlinear constitutive force model selection and model-updating framework at engineering problems where contact--impact phenomena happen in a sequential periodic manner is presented. At first, the dynamic behavior of the examined problem due to variation in impact parameters, excitation frequency and applied force model is examined. The general viscoelastic impact force law based on the Hertz contact theory, augmented with a damping term is integrated in the FE model. Experimental trials of the impacting cantilever beam under base excitation were carried out, and a model selection process between nine different expressions of the viscous term at a constant impact parameter is performed. Inadequacy of the updated selected model dictated a new model selection approach including the constant impact parameter. A new model selection and updating process is finally presented in order to tune and study in detail the effect of impact parameters and clearance gap between the contacting bodies in a specific sinusoidal excitation frequency of the impacting cantilever beam, validating the experimental results.},

 abstract = {This paper presents two sequential friction-spring damper configurations and develops numerical and analytical models, which describe the systems' behavior. The dampers rely on the non-smooth characteristics of dry friction to quench unwanted oscillations and only dissipate energy once a preset breakaway force of the friction element is exceeded. Since no additional control is required and the dissipation is only present within a given frequency range, this passive amplitude adaptive dissipation contributes to a higher energy efficiency. The dampers' equations of motion are derived and implemented in a numerical model to gain the first insights into the dampers' behavior. These equations of motion are analyzed via averaging methods in combination with a modal decoupling for nonlinear systems, which lead to the dampers' analytical models. The results from both models are compared and show reasonable agreement within the validity range of asymptotic methods.

@misc{arkh2008,
 abstract = {A large height to chord ratio, or aspect ratio, of

industrial gas turbine blades, especially for the last rows,

requires an increase of the blade natural frequencies

above the 2nd Engine Order (EO). Generally this is

possible only by utilizing a shrouded blade design.

During the design process there are also several other

mechanical factors, such as LCF, HCF, creep, shroud

coupling, and aero efficiency, which have to be taken into

consideration.

It is shown that mathematical models of different

complexity levels (1D / 3D models) can give comparable

results for many important parameters if the boundary

conditions for the 1D model are corrected by using the

results of 3D model analysis. These parameters include

quantities such as shroud contact pressure and coupling

forces, the rotor speed at which full coupling is achieved,

the first three blade natural frequencies, blade profile

untwist moment and angle, and von Mises elastic stresses

in critical sections. Thus a combination of 1D and 3D

models can achieve a reduction of the time required for

design of a shrouded turbine blade.

The type of shroud design, the initial shroud

clearance, and the contact surface angle are the important

parameters for a shrouded turbine blade. The influence of

these factors on dynamic response and lifetime prediction

is non-linear and not always obvious, so a good blade

design usually requires searching for an optimal

combination of different design, technological and

operational factors.

Significant design parameters for blade frequency

tuning are the radial distributions of cross-sectional

geometrical characteristics and especially the radial

distribution of the stagger angle. The latter one allows the

designer to bring together or to move apart the first and

the second vibration modes.

More suitable parameter combinations are

determined by the usage of mathematical optimization

methods. The method presented and the corresponding

techniques were used during design of shrouded blades

for a few new turbines, where the length of the blade

airfoil has exceeded 800mm.},

 abstract = {In order to reduce vibratory stresses and high-cycle-fatigue damage in turbines, it is strongly required to increase and estimate friction 

damping at contact interfaces, such as blade-disk attachments, shroud interfaces, and platform-type dampers. Studies on analytical 

estimation of friction damping are broadly classified into two approaches:~macroscopig and microscopig ones. in discussing friction 

damping when the interface is subjected to a non-uniform load distribution under micro-slip condition, the microscopig approch has

some advantages. However, there are two major problems; 1) there is few available data about the friction properties, such as 

tangential contact stiffness and micro-slip, 2) particular friction law should be derived to simulate micro-slip behaviour instead of 

Coulomb's friction law which expresses only macro slip.

In this paper, to cope with the above mentioned difficulties for the microscopig approach, an analytical procedure was developed by 

incorporating an original method to evaluate micro-slip and dissipated-energy distribution over the contact interfaces using friction

properties which are determined from hysteresis cycles experimentally obtained by special-fretting-friction tests. The validity of our 

proposed procedure was verified with high accuracy since estimated and tested damping ratios by vibration tests using dovetail

models were in very good agreement quantitatively with different input g levels, contact pressures, and contact angles, \textgreek{J}. Comparing

the effects of \textgreek{J} on damping ratio at the same contact force and input g levels, the highest damping was obtained at \textgreek{J} = 45°, following

by 20°, and the lowest one at \textgreek{J}~=~60° by vibration tests, whose trend was also confirmed to be expressed well qualitatively by our 

analysis. According to special-fretting-friction tests, it was found that tangential contact stiffness, Kt can be decided from the master curve,

p-Kt/Sc X L, where p is contact pressure, Sc is contact area and L is contact length along sliding direction, and micro-slip range, \textgreek{D} \textgreek{d}s can

be obtained from the relation \textgreek{D} \textgreek{d}s / p-Ft/Fn, where Fn is normal contact force and Ft is tangential contact force, since those master curves 

were confirmed to express test data with small scatter bands under different test conditions.},

@phdthesis{asho1999,
 abstract = {Modal Analysis has been a developing science in the experimental evaluation of the

dynamic properties of the structures. In practice, the models produced by modal

testing often have poor quality due to factors inherent in the measurement. One of the

sources of a lack of precision in modal testing is the errors caused by mechanical

devices such as accelerometers, suspension springs and stingers.



The aim of this thesis is to improve the current methods of modal testing for dealing

with mechanical errors and to develop new ones which permit the acquisition of

modal test data of high quality. To achieve this end, the work initially focuses on

reviewing existing methods. The research, then, focuses on developing methods for

assessing the quality of the measurement; and for cancelling the effects of mechanical

devices on the measured FRFs in the cases that the quality of the measurement is not

acceptable.



A new method has been developed for the correction of mass-loading effects of

accelerometers on measured FRFs. It is shown that the non-driving point FRFs can be

corrected if the measurement is repeated with an accelerometer with different mass. It

is also shown that the driving point FRF of the response point can be obtained by the

same procedure without actually having to measure it. Moreover, this method is used

for assessing the quality of the measurement due to mass-loading effects of

transducers in a conventional modal test. A similar method is developed for assessing

the quality of measurement and for the correction of the effects of suspension springs

on the measured FRFs.



The problem of the interaction between the test structure and the shaker through

stinger is discussed and the practical ways to avoid the effects of the stinger on the

measured FRFs has been investigated. Particular attention is given to the problem of

the misalignment of the stinger and its effect on the measured FRFs. Moreover, a

method for assessing the effects of the stinger on the measured FRFs is presented.



The correction method is further developed for the cases that the test structure is

affected by mechanical elements in more than one DOF. Moreover, it is shown that

nonlinearity of the structure or the attached elements affects the results of the

correction of the measured FRFs.



Although a new trend has been developed for the initial aim of dealing with

mechanical errors in modal testing, it has been shown that this new trend is applicable

in other fields of modal testing such as generation of rotational FRFs. On this basis a

method is developed to eliminate the need for producing the rotational excitations and

measuring them.



It is also shown that the whole matrix of translational FRFs can be generated from

measurements of one column using one accelerometer and one dummy mass. This

procedure can eliminate the problem of residual effects of out-of-range modes.

Finally, a recommended test strategy for acquisition of modal test data of high quality

related to the mechanical errors is presented.},

 abstract = {Abstract

In this paper, we present a detailed numerical study of the non-linear dynamics in structural components under unilateral contact constraints. Here, the unilateral term characterises the constitutive law of the restoring force in the constraints as they only sustain elastic reactions in one direction, either compressive or tensile. Thus, the non-differentiability of the contact law at the discontinuity point is the only source of non-linearity. In our approach, the discrete lattice method (DLM) is used to treat the continuous system as a piecewise linear model. Thus, the trajectory of each node in the discrete model would be a sequence of smooth solutions with the switching times between them. The application of the one-step integration scheme allows us to detect the occurrence of contact (i.e. the instants that the lattice nodes cross the discontinuity boundary) and consequently update the active constraints. We also consider embedding the bisection algorithm into the time integration procedure to localise the instants at which the nodes cross the boundary and minimise the accumulative error. Subsequently, the resulting unconditionally stable integration scheme is utilised as the modelling tool in combination with the shooting technique to perform a novel non-smooth modal analysis. In analogy with the smooth non-linear systems, the evolution of non-smooth periodic motions is presented in the frequency-stiffness plots. We apply our method to obtain non-linear normal modes (NNMs) for a number of representative problems, including a bar-obstacle system, a beam-substrate system and a granular chain with tensionless interactions. These numerical examples demonstrate the efficiency of the solution procedure to trace the family of energy-independent non-linear modes across the range of contact stiffnesses. Moreover, the stability analysis of the modes on the plot backbone reveal that they may become unstable due to the interaction with the higher modes or bifurcation of a new NNM with a period equal to the integer multiple of the main mode period. Our results also indicate that the bilinear formula can accurately predict the non-linear frequencies only if the corresponding mode exhibits a smooth character, regardless of the commutativity conditions of the system stiffness matrix. However, it is obvious that the assumption of smooth bilinear behaviour for non-linear modes is not generally valid. This highlights the importance of the present numerical framework for the computation of non-smooth resonance frequencies.},

 abstract = {The nonlinear normal modes of a geometrically nonlinear multi-span beam consisting of n segments, coupled by means of torsional stiffeners are examined. Assuming that the stiffeners possess large torsional stiffness, the beam displacements are decomposed into static and flexible components. It is shown that the static components are much smaller in magnitude than the flexible ones. A Galerkin approximation is subsequently employed to discretize the problem, whereby the computation of the nonlinear normal modes of the multi-span beam is reduced to the study of the periodic solutions of a set of weakly coupled, weakly nonlinear ordinary differential equations. Numerous stable and unstable, localized and non-localized nonlinear normal modes of the multi-span beam are detected. Assemblies consisting of n = 2, 3, and 4 beam segments are examined, and are found to possess stable, strongly localized nonlinear normal modes. These are free synchronous oscillations during which only one segment of the assembly vibrates with finite amplitude. As the number of periodic segments increases, the structure of the nonlinear normal modes becomes increasingly more complicated. In the multi-span beams examined, nonlinear mode localization is generated through two distinct mechanisms: through Pitchfork or Saddle-node mode bifurcations, or as the limit of a continuous mode branch when a coupling parameter tends to zero.},

 abstract = {The focus of this paper is on demonstrating the potential to damp entire bladed disks using dampers on only a fraction of the blades. This problem is first considered without the presence of random mistuning and it is demonstrated that a few dampers at optimized locations can lead to a significant reduction in the forced response of the entire bladed disk. Unfortunately, this optimum design may not be robust with respect to random mistuning and a notable fraction of the reduction in forced response obtained may disappear because of mistuning.

To regain the reduction in forced response but with mistuning present, robustness to mistuning is enhanced by using intentional mistuning in addition to dampers. The intentional mistuning strategy selected here is the A/B pattern mistuning in which the blades all belong to either type A or B. An optimization effort is then performed to obtain the best combination of A/B pattern and damper location to minimize the mistuned forced response of the disk. The addition of intentional mistuning in the system is shown to be very efficient and the optimum bladed disk design does indeed exhibit a significant reduction of mistuned forced response as compared to the tuned system. These findings were obtained on both single-degree-of-freedom per blade disk models and a reduced order model of a blisk.},

Rev.,63(6), p. 060802), and it is devoted to applications of nonlinear normal modes (NNMs) theory. NNMs are typical regimes of motions in wide classes of nonlinear mechanical systems. The significance of NNMs for mechanical engineering is determined by several important properties of these motions. Forced resonances motions of nonlinear systems occur close to NNMs. Nonlinear phenomena, such as nonlinear localization and transfer of energy, can be analyzed using NNMs. The NNMs analysis is an important step to study more complicated behavior of nonlinear mechanical systems.This review focuses on applications of Kauderer-Rosenberg and Shaw-Pierre concepts of nonlinear normal modes. The Kauderer-Rosenberg NNMs are applied for analysis of large amplitude dynamics of finite-degree-of-freedom nonlinear mechanical systems. Systems with cyclic symmetry, impact systems, mechanical systems with essentially nonlinear absorbers, and systems with nonlinear vibration isolation are studied using this concept. Applications of the Kauderer-Rosenberg NNMs for discretized structures are also discussed. The Shaw-Pierre NNMs are applied to analyze dynamics of finite-degree-of-freedom mechanical systems, such as floating offshore platforms, rotors, piece-wise linear systems. Studies of the Shaw-Pierre NNMs of beams, plates, and shallow shells are reviewed, too. Applications of Shaw-Pierre and King-Vakakis continuous nonlinear modes for beam structures are considered.

 abstract = {This work aims in obtaining the transient response of an overhung rotor undergoing vibro-impacts due to a defective bearing. An overhung rotor clamped on one end, with a flywheel on the other and impacts occurring in between, due to a bearing with clearance, is considered. The variation of this system, popularly known as the Jeffcot rotor, has been considered in previous works, but there, the system has been reduced to a single degree of freedom for ease of analysis. In this work the system is modeled as a continuous rotor including gyroscopic effects and the governing partial differential equations are set up and numerically solved. The method of assumed models is used to discretize the system in order to solve the partial differential equations (PDE) by partially decoupling them and solving numerically. These partially decoupled equations are more accurate and less time consuming than the ones produced by finite elements or other numerical schemes. The most important step in the success of this method is the selection of suitable modes for decoupling the system. It is not simply enough to select orthonormal modes for decoupling the PDEs, but care must be taken to select the modes as close to the actual system as possible. Using this method numerical experiments are run and representative results are presented. The different numerical issues involved are also discussed. An experimental setup was also built to run experiments and validate the results. In the setup a defective bearing is introduced at the flywheel end of the shaft to create radial impacts on the shaft. Laser sensor non-contact probes are used to measure the displacement of the shaft a specified locations. Experimental observations show satisfactory qualitative agreement when compared to the numerical integrations. {\copyright} 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The results indicated that the failure of the blades was promoted by foreign-particle erosion, which attacked preferentially the low-pressure side of the lower trailing edge of the blades.

 abstract = {Analysis of strongly nonlinear (vibro-impact) systems revealed an existence of nonlinear modes of vibration with spatial and temporal concentration of energy. The modes can be realised, for example, through intensification of the vibration process by condensing the vibration into a sequence of collisions for impulsive action of the tools to the media being treated or can be as a result of some discontinuity (slackening of a contact, arrival of crack, etc.) in the structure. The use of the nonlinear modes to develop useful mechanical work leads to necessity of excitation and control of resonance in ill-defined dynamical systems. This is due to the poorly predictable response of the media being treated. Excitation, stabilisation and control of a nonlinear mode at the top intensity in such systems is an engineering challenge and needs a new method of adaptive control for its realisation. Such a control technique was developed with the use of self-exciting mechatronic systems.

The instability is controlled by intelligent identification of the mode and active tracing of the optimal relationship between phase shifting and limitation in the feedback circuitry.

 abstract = {Modern compact design often does not permit the effective use of linear vibration isolation in the case of the intense environmental disturbances. Demands for limitation of the dynamic deflections lead to the use of heavy damped vibration isolators, sometimes in combination with the bumpers installed with the maximal free travel. The increase in isolator damping improves the low frequency resonant response at the expense of an inferior isolation performance in the high-frequency range. The installation of bumpers with enlarged travel reduces the probability of the accidental impacts and effectively trims the excessive deflections in an emergency. However, it turns the isolator into a vibro-impact structure, where the appearance of intense impulsive accelerations and high-powered non-linear resonance becomes the subject of concern. The idea of the present novel concept is based on co-operative use of anundamped, low frequency vibration isolatorin combination withoptimally damped bumpersinstalled withminimal free travel. Such as isolator demonstrates the advantages of the linear undamped isolator under low level ambient and operational high frequency excitation. However, under severe ambient disturbances, for any excessive deflections, it becomes strongly non-linear and takes on the quality of an optimal shock absorber. The approach formulated has been applied successfully to a design of a gimballed electro-optical device based on the linear split Sterling cryocooler for a focal array.},

The eddy current damper consists of the permanent magnets and the conducting sheet. The relative motion between the magnets and the conducting sheet produces eddy currents thus resulting in the electromagnetic force, which turns out to be the damping force thus suppressing vibrations. The important advantage of the proposed eddy current damper is that it does not require any electronic devices and external power supplies. In the present study, the theoretical model for the eddy current damper is derived using the electromagnetic theory combined with the image method. The theoretical model enables us to estimate the damping augmented to the host structure as well as develop a design tool for the eddy current damper. It is found from the comparison with the experimental results that the theoretical model can predict the damping characteristics and the dynamic behavior of the structure. The theoretical and experimental results also showed that the vibration of the beam can be successfully suppressed by means of the eddy current damper.},

 abstract = {Energy transfer plays an essential role in many natural and engineering processes which include different scales. Understanding how the energy cascade (which refers to the energy transfer among the different scales) works is of primary importance. One notable example is the energy cascade in turbulent flow whose kinetic energy is transferred from large eddies to smaller ones. Below a threshold scale the energy is dissipated due to viscous friction. We introduce a nonlinear phenomenological mechanistic model of turbulence which consists of masses connected by springs arranged in a binary tree structure. To represent the various scales, the masses are gradually decreased in lower levels. The bottom level of the model consists of nonlinear energy sinks to provide dissipation. Based on previous research, we choose the system parameters and analyze its behavior for simple impulsive excitations. The decay of the total mechanical energy and the discrete energy spectrum of the system are compared for different impulse magnitudes. It is demonstrated that the dissipation is much more significant compared to the linear model, if the input energy is large enough. The energy spectra are compared with that of the linear model. We find that the energy spectrum of the nonlinear model better highlights the cut-off feature of the Kolmogorov spectrum. {\copyright} 2019, Magdeburger Verein fur Technische Mechanik e. V..

This is particularly true in nonlinear settings that tend to dramatically increase computational complexity. Although significant progress has been achieved in the development of computational approaches for the reduction of nonlinear computational mechanics models, addressing the issue of contact remains a major hurdle. To this effect, this paper introduces a projection-based model reduction approach for both static and dynamic contact problems. It features the application of a non-negative matrix factorization scheme to the construction of a positive reduced-order basis for the contact forces, and a greedy sampling algorithm coupled with an error indicator for achieving robustness with respect to model parameter variations. The proposed approach is successfully demonstrated for the reduction of several two-dimensional, simple, but representative contact and self contact computational models.

 abstract = {Non-linear Modal Analysis (NMA) refers to a class of analysis procedures that seek to characterize non-linear dynamical systems similar to how classical linear modal analysis characterizes the natural frequencies and mode shapes of linear systems. The current study proposes an extension to the stationarity of Rayleigh quotients, a classical technique for linear modal analysis, for non-linear, non-conservative, dynamical systems. The approach, termed Rayleigh Quotient-based Nonlinear Modal Analysis (RQNMA), formalizes each mode as a finite non-trivial perturbation about a static solution that is locally stationary in the work done. Apart from offering a theoretical basis for the concept of non-linear modes, this circumvents several limitations in previous methods (for example, Quasi-Static Modal Analysis (QSMA)), such as inconsistencies in handling static forces, assumptions on mode-shape change, etc. As with other NMA procedures, RQNMA is formulated for the characterization of the amplitude-dependent natural frequency (stiffness) and damping ratio (dissipation) near/at the resonances. The estimated stiffness and dissipation characteristics are compared with modal backbones generated from frequency-domain approaches, which typically are computationally more expensive than the presented approach. Comparisons are conducted using different benchmark models, placing special emphasis on structures with pre-stressed frictional contacts, in order to bring out the strengths and shortcomings of the presented approach to contextualize its applicability.},

 abstract = {In the present article, we follow up our recent work on the experimental assessment of two data-driven nonlinear system identification methodologies. The first methodology constructs a single nonlinear-mode model from periodic vibration data obtained under phase-controlled harmonic excitation. The second methodology constructs a state-space model with polynomial nonlinear terms from vibration data obtained under uncontrolled broadband random excitation. The conclusions drawn from our previous work (experimental) were limited by uncertainties inherent to the specimen, instrumentation, and signal processing. To avoid these uncertainties in the present work, we pursued a completely numerical approach based on synthetic measurement data obtained from simulated experiments. Three benchmarks are considered, which feature geometric, unilateral contact, and dry friction nonlinearity, respectively. As in our previous work, we assessed the prediction accuracy of the identified models with a focus on the regime near a particular resonance. This way, we confirmed our findings on the strengths and weaknesses of the two methodologies and derive several new findings: First, the state-space method struggles even for polynomial nonlinearities if the training data is chaotic. Second, the polynomial state-space models can reach high accuracy only in a rather limited range of vibration levels for systems with non-polynomial nonlinearities. Such cases demonstrate the sensitivity to training data inherent in the method, as model errors are inevitable here. Third, although the excitation does not perfectly isolate the nonlinear mode (exciter-structure interaction, uncontrolled higher harmonics, local instead of distributed excitation), the modal properties are identified with high accuracy.},

 abstract = {One strategy to develop both accurate and computationally tractable models of jointed structures is reduced order modeling through hyper-reduced representations of the interfaces in contact. Hyper reduction refers to reduction techniques that result in a Reduced Order Model (ROM) that is complete by itself, i.e., all displacements and forces are fully described in the ROM coordinates directly. Focusing primarily on applications involving small relative displacement contacts, two fundamentally different approaches are formulated and compared for merits and limitations in applicability. The first is an adaptation of the stiffness-preserving RBE3 constraint elements, and the second is an interpolation approach based on remeshing the interface. Although RBE3 is extensively used in the literature, the current formulation derives stiffness preserving elements that are specifically useful for contact dynamics applications. Transformations are developed to express force--displacement relationships in the ROM coordinates that are congruent (in the sense of using the same contact models) as well as consistent (in the sense of being faithful to the quantities involved) with a high-fidelity model of the same structure. These approaches are applied to study a three-bolted lap-joint structure (the Brake-Reu{\ss} Beam (BRB) benchmark) that has been observed to demonstrate characteristic contact non-linearities. Multiple strategies for the hyper reduction are evaluated, including graph partitioning, finite element coarsening, and homogenization of field objectives, some of which involve an extra step of remeshing/choosing patches based on a field objective (e.g., contact pressure). The performances of the ROMs are assessed by conducting nonlinear modal analysis and computing a posteriori error metrics.},

Based on a coarse model of the structure to be modified, the proposed methodology tackles two major difficulties: efficient predictions for distributed modifications and handling of the lack of measurement points on the coupling interface. In addition, displacements bases introduced to reconstruct unmeasured behaviour of the interface limit error propagation through the process. Moreover, two indicators are introduced to select the optimal prediction.

 abstract = {The paper presents a novel reduction method in the class of component mode synthesis techniques. The method is here called Gram--Schmidt Interface (GSI), since it is based on the Gram--Schmidt algorithm. The GSI reduction method addresses problems where the Craig--Bampton reduced order model of a substructure has still a large number of interface degrees of freedom that should be further reduced. Starting from the pre-existing reduction method based on the Characteristic Constraint Modes, the GSI technique goes further, being suitable to reduce a Craig--Bampton model that retains as a master a wide variety of boundary DoFs (interface, active, etc.). The GSI method is here proved to be effective when assembling adjacent substructures having non-compatible meshes at the interfaces. This is possible by performing the interfaces coupling in the modal space of the GSI modes instead in the space of physical degrees of freedom. The technique is here applied to a turbomachinery test case consisting of a blade coupled with a disk's sector treated in cyclic symmetry conditions. It is also demonstrated how the GSI method appears useful in the reduction of cyclic symmetric structures, representing a valid alternative of the method developed by Tran.},

Due to the large extension of the contact interfaces the use of classic node-to-node contact elements based on the Coulomb friction law becomes cumbersome. Although such approach appears convenient for problems involving small contact regions, it is computationally expensive when large contact interfaces with refined meshes are present between components. In this research, a novel modal interface reduction method is combined with a layer of Jenkins contact elements in order to efficiently predict the effects of friction on the non-linear forced response of the stator bladed disk. The wide rail/hook contact regions are therefore suitable for the application of the presented technique. The goodness of the proposed methodology is quantified both in terms of accuracy and time costs savings on the calculation of non-linear forced responses by exploiting cyclic symmetry hypotheses and the Harmonic Balance Method.},

 abstract = {The design of complex structures requires a deep understanding on how neighboring components mutually interact during vibration. Such interaction makes the dynamic behavior of the whole system highly nonlinear due to the presence of contact phenomena at the interfaces between the components. Although several mechanical applications exhibit localized friction joints, a wide variety of structures involve a class of joints featuring extended contact interfaces. This is the case of bolted flanges and lap joints used in turbomachinery for aeronautical applications. Modeling the dynamics of such large structures by using commercial FE codes is the typical approach that industries would adopt. However, two issues must be faced at the same time. First, the number of degrees of freedom involved in the numerical simulation is sometimes so large that even linear dynamic analyses become prohibitive in terms of required computational time or limited capabilities of the computer hardware. Second, the non-linear behavior of frictional joints can only be evaluated by direct time integration approaches, making most of the time the analyses unfeasible due to huge computational costs. This paper addresses both aspects together by proposing novel techniques for the modal reduction of FE models, which guarantee high compression of the number of the degrees of freedom at the contact interfaces. This allows for a modal representation of the corresponding contact forces by leading to a dramatic reduction of the size of the non-linear problem.},

The out-of-plane sensitivity required for vibration measurement for 3D-DIC is orders of magnitude less than LDV making higher frequency displacements difficult to sense. Furthermore, the digital cameras used to capture the DIC images have no filter to eliminate temporal aliasing of the digitized signal.

the material damping is low, the frictional effects in joints and clamping boundary conditions dominate the structural

damping. The damping and the stiffness of the structure are nonlinear functions of the system states and consequently

of the excitation signal and amplitude. If these nonlinear effects should be incorporated in the design process, transient

simulations must be employed in order to predict and analyze the damping for a given excitation, though they need

excessive computation power due to the nonlinear constitutive laws and the high contact stiffnesses.

As one approach to alleviate transient simulations, the application of component mode synthesis (CMS) methods to

In the first step this equivalent blisk model (EBM) is derived based on a finite element analysis of the disk from design and an adjustment to experimentally determined blade alone frequencies in order to consider the real blade mistuning. Applying the EBM -- so far not considering the air flow influence -- to carry out forced response analyses due to a rotating excitation acting on the stationary blisk, a maximum blade displacement amplification of more than 50 {\%} has been calculated comparing the tuned and the mistuned blisk. Aiming at an additional consideration of the air flow, fully coupled computations of the fluid structure interaction (FSI) are exemplarily carried out for elastically supported blades in a cascade arrangement. The results are used to calibrate simple mass-spring-damper models from which quantities of additional aerodynamic elements in terms of a consideration of co-vibrating air masses, air stiffening and aerodynamic damping are derived. Based on this information the EBM is extended to a so called advanced EBM. Aerodynamic influences are considered assigning the aerodynamic properties to each blade in dependence on the inter blade phase angle (IBPA). Forced response analyses, now including all aerodynamic influences, show that for an extreme application of a rear blisk close to the combustion chamber and under MTO conditions a strong smoothing of originally localized vibration modes occurs. The maximum blade displacement amplification due to mistuning is decreased from more than 50 {\%} to below 12 {\%} for the first blade flap mode.},

In this paper, a procedure is outlined for obtaining modal information from total acceleration measurements for the case of base excitation using current software capabilities.

A nonlinear mode is defined in terms of amplitude, phase, frequency, damping coefficient and mode shape, where the last three quantities are amplitude and phase dependent. An amplitude-phase transformation is performed on the nonlinear dynamical system, giving the time evolution of the nonlinear mode motion via the two first-order differential equations governing the amplitude and phase variables, as well as the geometry of the invariant manifold. The system of formulation adopted here is suitable for use with a Galerkin-based computational procedure. The existence and stability of periodic orbits such as limit cycles on the associated invariant manifolds can be studied from the differential equations governing the amplitude and phase variables.

A relevant effect in this phenomenon is the micro-slip between the jointed surfaces. In order to verify the feasibility and the reliability of the numerical analyses performed on structures with junctions, the numerical results obtained by the finite elements method have been compared with those obtained experimentally. Several numerical analyses, in which friction forces have been represented as nonlinear loads, have been carried out for the FE models of two application cases: an electronic unit mounted within the Radarsat-2 satellite, and the complete Cosmo-Skymed spacecraft. Considering the load type, involving a typical high frequency response spectrum between 100 and 10000Hz, both numerical and experimental data have been reduced to the shock response spectrum form. After the comparative evaluation, taking into account also the damping effect, the agreement between numerical results and experimental data has been evaluated. The proposed numerical approach yields an effective and less expensive instrument, able to provide indications in the design phase, to allow the prevision of the dynamic behaviour of the structure for the prevention of failures in units or systems mounted within the spacecraft or launch vehicle. With the proposed model, it is possible to determine in a simple and direct way the characteristics of the damping due to the single bolted and riveted joints, and use them in similar multiple joints in the complete structure assembling or substructuring.},

The majority of methods for calculating the dynamic response of nonlinear aeroelastic systems considers only steady-state periodic behaviour. An exception is the Multiple Time Scales method, which can estimate both the transient and steady-state solutions of such systems; nevertheless, this approach is only accurate close to the Hopf bifurcation. This paper proposes a novel combined approach whereby the transient response is obtained from the Multiple Time Scales method and the asymptotic periodic behaviour is corrected using the Harmonic Balance method. This consistent and efficient framework mutually empowers both techniques and accounts for large parameter variations around the critical condition. The effect of cubic aero-structural nonlinearities on the dynamic response of a generic aeroelastic system is then investigated. Both the Multiple Time Scales and Harmonic Balance methods are adopted and perfect agreement of the explicit results is demonstrated, albeit near the system instability. In contrast, the proposed combined solution is valid for a wider range of perturbations, is analytical and has negligible computational cost while retaining accuracy. The role of key parameters and terms on the core mechanism of the dynamic behaviour is rigorously identified and discussed, from both physical and mathematical points of view. Galloping is finally considered as the simplest but complete application to a fundamental yet practical problem, featuring full conceptual complexity while exploiting the solid synthesis capability of the newly proposed analytical approach. Excellent agreement was found in all cases with results from the numerical integration of the nonlinear equations of motion in the time domain.},

The Galerkin method is used for the spatial integration of the resulting differential aeroelastic system, whereas the periodic blade response is determined by a harmonic balance approach. This aeroelastic model yields a unified approach for aeroelastic response and blade pressure prediction, that may conveniently be used for aeroacoustic purposes. It is able to examine configurations where blade--vortex interactions occur. Numerical results show the capability of the aeroelastic tool to evaluate blade response and vibratory hub loads for a helicopter main rotor in level and descent flight conditions, and examine the efficiency and robustness of the different numerical solution algorithms that may be applied in the developed aeroelastic solver. Comparisons among aeroelastic predictions based on different aerodynamic models are also presented.},

 abstract = {Turbomachinery components are exposed to unsteady aerodynamic loads which must be considered during the design process to ensure the structural mechanical integrity. There are two primary mechanisms which cause structural vibrations and can lead to high-cycle fatigue due to high dynamic stresses: flutter (self-excited vibrations) and forced response (forced excitation, e.g. wakes from upstream blade rows). In this work an emerging numerical frequency-domain method which is designed to efficiently simulate coupled fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems considering nonlinearities in the flow and structure is modified and applied to an academic and a realistic test case. Furthermore complex structural eigenmodes are considered instead of purely real modes as was demonstrated in the literature so far. This method is able to predict limit cycle oscillations and forced response amplitudes. The coupled solver uses the Harmonic Balance (HB) method with an alternating frequency time approach to model periodically unsteady flows and structure dynamics. The resulting nonlinear HB equations of the flow are solved with a pseudo-time stepping method while the nonlinear HB equations of the structure are solved with a Newton method. The dynamics of the involved structure are further simplified by considering only one relevant eigenmode of the structure. The method is applied to a 3D axial turbine configuration with a modified Young's modulus for the material of the blisk. The standard flutter curve of the blade row shows that at least one eigenmode is aerodynamically unstable at certain nodal diameters. As a first model test case for the harmonic balance solver, the nonlinear structural damping is defined as a cubic modal damping term. The results of the frequency-domain method are compared to coupled FSI simulations in the time domain. The analysis shows that the frequency-domain method is very promising in terms of both computational efficiency and accuracy.},

 abstract = {Flutter stability is a dominant design constraint of modern turbines. Thus, flutter-tolerant designs are currently explored, where the resulting vibrations remain within acceptable bounds. In particular, friction damping has the potential to yield limit cycle oscillations (LCOs) in the presence of a flutter instability. To predict such LCOs, it is the current practice to model the aerodynamic forces in terms of aerodynamic influence coefficients for a linearized structural model with fixed oscillation frequency. This approach neglects that both the nonlinear contact interactions and the aerodynamic stiffness cause a change in the deflection shape and the frequency of the LCO. This, in turn, may have a substantial effect on the aerodynamic damping. The goal of this paper is to assess the importance of these neglected interactions. To this end, a state-of-the-art aero-elastic model of a low pressure turbine blade row is considered, undergoing nonlinear frictional contact interactions in the tip shroud interfaces. The LCOs are computed with a fully coupled harmonic balance method, which iteratively computes the Fourier coefficients of structural deformation and conservative flow variables, as well as the a priori unknown frequency. The coupled algorithm was found to provide excellent computational robustness and efficiency. Moreover, a refinement of the conventional energy method is developed and assessed, which accounts for both the nonlinear contact boundary conditions and the linearized aerodynamic influence. It is found that the conventional energy method may not predict a limit cycle oscillation at all while the novel approach presented here can.},

 abstract = {The equivalence of the finite-element formulations used inflexible multibody dynamics is the focus of this investigation. Thisequivalence will be used to address several fundamental issues related tothe deformations, flexible body coordinate systems, and the geometriccentrifugal stiffening effect. Two conceptually different finite-elementformulations that lead to exact modeling of the rigid body dynamics will beused. The first one is the absolute nodal coordinateformulation in which beams and plates can be treated as isoparametricelements. This formulation leads to a constant and symmetric mass matrix andhighly nonlinear elastic forces. In this study, it is demonstrated thatdifferent element coordinate systems which are used for the convenience ofdescribing the element deformations lead to similar results as the elementsize is reduced. In particular, two element frames are used;the pinned and the tangent frames. The pinned frame has one ofits axes passing through two nodes of the element, while the tangent frame isrigidly attached to one of the ends of the element. Numerical resultsobtained using these two different frames are found tobe in good agreement as the element size decreases. The relationshipbetween the coordinates used in the absolute nodal coordinate formulationand the floating frame of reference formulation is presented. Thisrelationship can be used to obtain the highly nonlinear expression of thestrain energy used in the absolute nodal coordinate formulation from thesimple energy expression used in the floating frame of referenceformulation. It is also shown that the source of the nonlinearityis due to the finite rotation of the element. The result of the analysispresented clearly demonstrates that the instability observedin high-speed rotor analytical models due to the neglect of the geometriccentrifugal stiffening is not a problem inherent to a particular finite-element formulation. Such a problem can only be avoided by considering the known linear effect of the geometric centrifugal stiffening or by using a nonlinear elastic model as recently demonstrated. Fourier analysis of the solutions obtained in this investigation also sheds new light on the fundamental problem of the choice of the deformable body coordinate system in the floating frame of reference formulation. Another method forformulating the elastic forces in the absolute nodal coordinate formulationbased on a continuum mechanics approach is also presented.},

This work presents a novel way to calculate the response amplitude of an elastically supported cylinder experiencing vortex-induced vibrations. The method couples a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model of the shedding vortex flow to a structural model representation of the elastically supported cylinder. The aerodynamic forces on the cylinder are calculated using a harmonic balance, frequency domain solver. Three cases are considered: the cylinder vibrating transverse to the flow, in-line with the flow, and with both degrees of freedom. Two shedding patterns are observed, symmetric and antisymmetric, depending on the lock-in region considered. The in-line degree of freedom does not have a significant effect on the cylinder cross-flow response, except for very low mass or very low damping.},

This method utilizes proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) of coordinate measurement machine (CMM) data on blades' geometries, and sector analyses using ansys and solid modeling. In a recent paper, MMDA has been extended to use second order Taylor series approximations of perturbations in mass and stiffness matrices (\textgreek{d}M and \textgreek{d}K) instead of exact \textgreek{d}M and \textgreek{d}K. Taylor series expansions of deviations in mass and stiffness matrices due to geometric mistuning give a direct approach for generating the reduced order model from the components of POD features of spatial variations in blades' geometries. Reversing the process, algorithms for mistuning identification based on MMDA are presented in this paper to calculate the geometric mistuning parameters.

Considering different sensors for response measurements, two common collocations in shaker modal testing are investigated: (1) shaker+Laser Doppler vibrometer case in which only force transducer mass loading effects need to be removed, and (2) shaker+accelerometer case in which both accelerometer and force transducer mass should be eliminated. The correction method employed for case (1) is theoretically deduced and it demonstrates a good performance in experimental validation. Two correction methods are proposed for case (2) and the numerical simulation shows that one of them is effective with certain degree noisy data, however, another is vulnerable to the noise.

The combination of these SMA properties with the mechanical and the lightweight of fiberglass-reinforced polymer (FGRP) is a promising solution for manufacturing of innovative composites for vibration suppression in structural applications.

The selected SMA Cu 66Zn24Al10 at.{\%} was prepared by vacuum induction melting; the ingot was subsequently hot-and-cold rolled down to 0.2 mm thickness tape. The choice of a copper alloy is related to some advantages in comparison with NiTiCu SMA alloys, which was tested for the similar presented application in a previous study: lower cost, higher storage modulus and consequently higher damping properties in martensitic state. The patterning of the SMA sheets was performed by means of a pulsed fiber laser. After the laser processing, the SMA sheets were heat treated to obtain the desired martensitic state at room temperature. The transformation temperatures were measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The damping properties were determined, at room temperature, on full-scale sheet, using a universal testing machine (MTS), with cyclic tensile tests at different deformation amplitudes. Damping properties were also determined as a function of the temperature on miniature samples with a dynamical mechanical analyzer (DMA).

In particular, this work shows how the existing modeling technique is readily extended to turbomachinery rotors with shrouded blades. The modeling technique employs a component mode synthesis approach to systematically generate a reduced order model (ROM) using component modes calculated from a finite element model (FEM) of the rotor. Based on the total number of degrees of freedom, the ROM is typically two or three orders of magnitude smaller than the FEM. This makes it feasible to predict the forced response statistics of mistuned bladed disks using Monte Carlo simulations. In this work, particular attention is devoted to the introduction of mistuning into the ROM of a shrouded assembly. Mistuning is modeled by projecting the mistuned natural frequencies of a single, cantilever blade with free shrouds onto the harmonic modes of the shrouded blade assembly. Thus, the necessary mistuning information may be measured by testing individual blades.},

@phdthesis{blad2001a,
 abstract = {The research work reported in this dissertation aims to provide computational methodologies and to further the understanding of physical phenomena that will aid and improve the design of bladed disk assemblies from a structural dynamics standpoint. Bladed disk structures are found in a wide array of applications, including small impeller pumps andautomotive turbo systems; large gas, steam, and hydro turbines for power generation; and jet engines for military and commercial aircraft propulsion.



Based on the nominal design, a bladed disk assembly is a rotationally periodic structure. If it is assumed that each disk-blade sector is identical, then the theory of cyclic symmetry may be used to analyze the dynamics of the entire structure based on one fundamental disk-blade sector. In practice, however, there are always small differences among the structural properties of individual blades, which destroy the cyclic symmetry of the bladed disk assembly. These structural irregularities, commonly referred to as mistuning, may derive from manufacturing tolerances, deviations in material properties, or non-uniform operational wear. Mistuning is known to have a potentially dramatic effect on the vibratory behavior of the rotor, since it can lead to spatial localization of the vibration energy. Spatial localization implies that the vibration energy in a bladed disk becomes confined to one or a few blades rather than being uniformly distributed throughout the system. This phenomenon may be explained by viewing the vibration energy of the system as a circumferentially traveling wave. In a perfectly tuned system, the wave propagates through each identical disk-blade sector, yielding uniform vibration amplitudes that differ only in phase. In the mistuned case, however, the structural irregularities may cause the traveling wave to be partially reflected at each sector.



This can lead to confinement of vibration energy to a small region of the assembly. As a result, certain blades may experience forced response amplitudes and stresses that are substantially larger than those predicted by an analysis of the nominal design. Hence, certain blades may exhibit much shorter lifespans than would be predicted by a fatigue life assessment based on the nominal assembly.



In order to address this concern, some efficient computational methods have been developed that can predict the effects of mistuning on the vibratory response of a turbomachinery rotor stage. Furthermore, these techniques enable analyses of large numbers of randomly mistuned bladed disks in order to estimate the mistuned forced response statistics for a rotor design. However, at the outset of this research effort, no methods possessed the combination of accuracy and computational efficiency required to allow reliable statistical assessments of mistuning sensitivity to be included as an integral part of the turbomachinery rotor design process. Motivated by the turbomachinery community's need for practical design tools that incorporate mistuning effects, three distinct objectives are identified and addressed in this research effort:

1 - To develop highly efficient and accurate reduced order modeling techniques for the free and forced response of tuned and mistuned bladed disks, based on parent finite element representations of arbitrary complexity and detail in a consistent and systematic fashion.

2 - To broaden the scope of these reduced order modeling techniques by establishing linearized formulations for shrouded blade designs.

3 - To increase the understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms of the mistuning phenomenon, with particular emphasis on the role of disk flexibility and structural stage-to-stage coupling in determining a design's sensitivity to mistuning, leading to formulations for multi-stage synthesis and analysis.},

coupling in multi-stage rotors can have a critical impact on bladed disk

dynamics by altering significantly the flexibility of the disk. This affects

local eigenfrequency veering characteristics, and thus a design's sensitivity

to mistuning. In response to these findings, two reduced order

modeling techniques are presented that accurately capture structural interstage

coupling effects, while keeping model sizes at practical levels.

Both free and forced responses of an example two-stage rotor are examined

using novel component-mode-based reduced order modeling techniques

for mistuned multi-stage assemblies. Both techniques employ an

intermediate multi-stage model constructed by component mode synthesis

(CMS), which is further reduced by either: (a) partial secondary

modal analyses on constraint-mode partitions; or (b) a full-scale secondary

modal analysis on the entire multi-stage CMS model. The introduced

techniques are evaluated using finite element results as a benchmark.

The proposed reduced order modeling techniques are shown to

facilitate accurate multi-stage modeling and analyses with or without

blade mistuning, using only computationally inexpensive modal data

from a cyclic disk sector and a single blade per stage. It is concluded that

the most promising and practically feasible approach may be a combination

of approaches (a) and (b), in which secondary modal analyses and

truncations are first carried out on disk-blade constraint-mode partitions,

followed by a tertiarymodal analysis on the resulting multi-stage model.

Systematic comparisons are drawn with other numerical methods, and especially with continuation of periodic orbits, taken as reference solutions. Three different mechanical systems, displaying peculiar characteristics allowing for a general view of the performance of the methods for vibratory systems, are selected. Numerical results show that invariant manifolds encounter folding points at large amplitude, generically (but not only) due to internal resonances. These folding points involve an intrinsic limitation to reduced-order models based on the centre manifold and on the idea of a functional relationship between slave and master coordinates.

The localized damping introduces mode complexity, which results in spatial shifting of the peak resonance amplitudes to different locations of the string and highly nontrivial phase variations confined to certain predictable boundary layers of the string. We find that there exists a unique combination of system parameters such that mode complexity reaches an absolute maximum: in such an optimal case, damping destroys all the normal modes of vibration, and instead, traveling waves are formed. This peak in complexity marks the transition between very weak and very strong damping effects and provides a direct mode complexity-induced transition from vibrations (standing waves) to traveling waves.},

The effect of centrifugal force on the equivalent stiffness and the equivalent damping is studied. The forced response of one simplified blade with loosely assembled dovetail attachment is predicted by the harmonic balance method, in which the blade is described by the lumped mass and spring model, and the friction contact joints is simplified as a ideal friction damper. The results show that the equivalent stiffness of loosely assembled dovetail attachment increases with blade centrifugal force, gradually reaches a certain value, and there exists the maximum value for the equivalent stiffness. The equivalent damping increases at the beginning and then decreases with blade centrifugal force increasing, there exists a maximum too. The resonant frequency of blade rises with blade centrifugal force, but it no longer increases when the centrifugal force exceed a certain value. There exists a special centrifugal force on which the effect of dry friction damping is the best.},

These waves cause resonance passages of, e.g., rotating structures. To calculate the resonance passage a semi-analytical solution is proposed. Thus, high accuracy is guaranteed. The topic of exceeding amplitudes is initially approached by studying a discrete lumped mass model with detuned parameters. It can be shown that under certain circumstances the maximum amplitude of the transient resonance passage is even higher than the maximum amplitude of the steady-state solution. To investigate this phenomenon on a real bladed disk, the number of degrees of freedom of the blisk is reduced using component mode synthesis (CMS). By applying the semi-analytical solution to the reduced model, the envelopes of the vibration during resonance passage can be calculated. Processing extensive parametric studies it can be pointed out under which circumstances the probability rises that higher maximum amplitudes occur during resonance passage compared to steady-state conditions.

 abstract = {Nonlinear Energy Sinks (NESs) are a promising technique for passively reducing the amplitude of vibrations. Through nonlinear stiffness properties, a NES is able to passively and irreversibly absorb energy. Unlike the traditional Tuned Mass Damper (TMD), NESs do not require a specific tuning and absorb energy over a wider range of frequencies. Nevertheless, they are still only efficient over a limited range of excitations. In order to mitigate this limitation and maximize the efficiency range, this work investigates the optimization of multiple NESs configured in parallel. It is well known that the efficiency of a NES is extremely sensitive to small perturbations in loading conditions or design parameters. In fact, the efficiency of a NES has been shown to be nearly discontinuous in the neighborhood of its activation threshold. For this reason, uncertainties must be taken into account in the design optimization of NESs. In addition, the discontinuities require a specific treatment during the optimization process. In this work, the objective of the optimization is to maximize the expected value of the efficiency of NESs in parallel. The optimization algorithm is able to tackle design variables with uncertainty (e.g., nonlinear stiffness coefficients) as well as aleatory variables such as the initial velocity of the main system. The optimal design of several parallel NES configurations for maximum mean efficiency is investigated. Specifically, NES nonlinear stiffness properties, considered random design variables, are optimized for cases with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 10 NESs in parallel. The distributions of efficiency for the optimal parallel configurations are compared to distributions of efficiencies of non-optimized NESs. It is observed that the optimization enables a sharp increase in the mean value of efficiency while reducing the corresponding variance, thus leading to more robust NES designs.},

Such a set of non-linear equations is solved using the iterative numerical Newton--Raphson method.

centrifugal force as well as variable amplitude force due to fluctuating flow following in blade vibrations.

Underplatform Dampers (UPD) are commonly used to dissipate energy of vibration and reduce resonant

amplitudes in bladed discs. UPDs are pieces of metal loaded by the centrifugal force and pressed against

the platforms of two adjacent blades. Energy is dissipated by friction. To predict the forced response of the

blades with UPDs information are needed about i) the friction coefficient, ii) the contact stiffness and iii)

The contact forces acting on the UPD are computed by damper balance equations. The contact model

allows simulating three different states: stick, slip and separation. When the contact is fully stuck, the

static value of the static normal pre-load is non-unique. As a result, a range of variability in the forced

An extensive test campaign, with UPDs of different geometry and various centrifugal and excitation

 abstract = {In the field of turbomachinery, vibration amplitude is often reduced by dissipating the kinetic energy of the blades with devices that utilize dry friction. Under-platform dampers, for example, are often placed in the underside of two consecutive turbine blades. Dampers are kept in contact with the under-platform of the respective blades by means of the centrifugal force. If the damper is well designed, vibration of blades instigate a relative motion between the under-platform and the damper. A friction force, that is a non-conservative force, arises in the contact and partly dissipates the vibration energy. Several contact models are available in the literature to simulate the contact between the damper and the under-platform. However, the actual dynamics of the blade-damper interaction have not fully understood yet. Several test rigs have been previously developed to experimentally investigate the performance of under-platform dampers. The majority of these experimental setups aim to evaluate the overall damper efficiency in terms of reduction in response amplitude of the blade for a given exciting force that simulates the aerodynamic loads. Unfortunately, the experimental data acquired on the blade dynamics do not provide enough information to understand the damper dynamics. Therefore, the uncertainty on the damper behavior remains a big issue. In this work, a novel experimental test rig has been developed to extensively investigate the damper dynamic behavior. A single replaceable blade is clamped in the rig with a specific clamping device. With this device the blade root is pressed against a groove machined in the test rig. The pushing force is controllable and measurable, to better simulate the actual centrifugal load acting on the blade. Two dampers, one on each side of the blade, are in contact with the blade under-platforms and with platforms on force measuring supports. These supports have been specifically designed to measure the contact forces on the damper. The contact forces on the blade are computed by post processing the measured forces and assuming the static equilibrium of the damper. The damper kinematics is rebuilt by using the relative displacement, measured with a differential laser, between the damper and the blade under-platform. This article describes the main concepts behind this new approach and explains the design and working of this novel test rig. Moreover, the influence of the damper contact forces on the dynamic behavior of the blade is discussed in the result section.},

 abstract = {It is well known that bolted joints have significant influence on the dynamical behavior of assembled structures due to formation of damping. This paper focuses on damping caused by dry friction in a rotational joint. Friction can be either induced by micro-slipping or macro-slipping. This paper describes the design of a new experimental device intended to measure damping caused by friction and partial slip in rotational joints. An original method for measuring dissipated energy in rotational joints with plan-plan contact is proposed. This method is based on Lagrange formalism and allows to measure accurately forces and torques only with accelerometers. These techniques are available for very small displacements that occur in micro-slip and partial slip of surfaces in contact and are still available for large displacements (macro-slip). An analytical compact model based on the Greenwood model is studied. The experimental results and simulations used to quantify the dissipated energy in order to compute the damping ratio are presented and discussed. {\copyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

 abstract = {The results of the experimental study into the damping of flexural vibrations in turbofan blades with trailing edges tapered according to a power-law profile are reported. Trailing edges of power-law profile (wedges), with small pieces of attached absorbing layers, materialise one-dimensional acoustic black holes for flexural waves that can absorb a large proportion of the incident flexural wave energy. The experiments were carried out on four model blades made of aluminium. Two of them were twisted, so that a more realistic fan blade could be considered. All model blades, the ones with tapered trailing edges and the ones of traditional form, were excited by an electromagnetic shaker, and the corresponding frequency response functions have been measured. The results show that the resonant peaks are reduced substantially once a power-law tapering is introduced to the blade. An initial study into the aerodynamic implications of this method has been carried out as well, using measurements in a closed circuit wind tunnel. In particular, the effects of the trailing edge of power-law profile on the airflow-excited vibrations of the fan blades have been investigated. It has been demonstrated that trailing edges of power-law profile with appropriate damping layers are efficient in reduction of the airflow-excited vibrations of the fan blades. The obtained results demonstrate that power-law tapering of trailing edges of turbofan blades can be a viable method of reduction of blade vibrations.},

Since the Chebyshev or Legendre coefficients of derivatives of a function f(x) can be computed by trivial recurrences from those of the function itself, it follows that finding the maxima, minima and inflection points of a truncated Chebyshev or Fourier series f N (x) is also a problem of finding the zeros of a polynomial when written in truncated Chebyshev series form, or computing the roots of a trigonometric polynomial. Widely scattered results are reviewed and a few previously unpublished ideas sprinkled in. There are now robust zerofinders for all species of spectral series. A transcendental function f(x) can be approximated arbitrarily well on a real interval by a truncated Chebyshev series f N (x) of sufficiently high degree N. It follows that through Chebyshev interpolation and Chebyshev rootfinders, it is now possible to easily find all the real roots on an interval for any smooth transcendental function.},

 abstract = {In order to assess the predicted performance of a manufactured system, analysts must typically consider random variations (both geometric and material) in the development of a finite element model, instead of a single deterministic model of an idealized geometry. The incorporation of random variations, however, could potentially require the development of thousands of nearly identical solid geometries that must be meshed and separately analyzed, which would require an impractical number of man-hours to complete. This paper proposes a new approach to uncertainty quantification by developing parameterized reduced order models. These parameterizations are based upon Taylor series expansions of the systems matrices about the ideal geometry, and a component mode synthesis representation for each linear substructure is used to form an efficient basis with which to study the system. The numerical derivatives required for the Taylor series expansions are obtained efficiently using hyper dual numbers, which enable the derivatives to be calculated precisely to within machine precision. The theory is applied to a stepped beam system in order to demonstrate proof of concept. The accuracy of the methodology, level at which the parameterization is introduced, and efficiency of the methodology are discussed. Hyper dual numbers can be used to construct parameterized models both efficiently and accurately and constitute an appropriate methodology to account for perturbations in a structural system.},

At present, there is no predictive model of friction; however, several models have demonstrated the ability to reproduce the hysteretic behavior of an interface accurately once calibrated. From an assessment of the current state of the art, three trends emerge. First, an improved physical understanding of the mechanisms of friction is needed. Second, new strategies for accounting for model form error could improve the applicability of existing friction models. Third, with improved physical understanding and better strategies for managing model form error, a potential path forward may result in a two-model process: a highly detailed model that is used to predict the friction parameters for a specific system and a less detailed model that uses those results convoluted with new model form error strategies to simulate the dynamics of the system of interest.},

@article{brea2001,
 abstract = {The aim of this paper is to describe an integrated aeroelasticity model for turbine blade forced response predictions. Such an approach requires a successful integration of the unsteady aerodynamics with non-linear structural dynamics, the latter arising from the use of root friction dampers to dissipate energy so that the response levels can be kept as low as possible. The inclusion of friction dampers is known to raise the resonant frequencies by up to 20{\%} from the standard assembly frequencies, a shift that is not known prior to the aeroelasticity calculations because of its possible dependence on the unsteady excitation. An iterative procedure was therefore developed in order to determine the resonance shift under the effects of both unsteady dynamic loading and non-linear friction dampers. The iterative procedure uses a viscous, non-linear time-accurate flow representation for evaluating the aerodynamic forcing, a look-up table for determining the aerodynamic boundary conditions at any speed, and a time-domain friction damping module for resonance tracking. The methodology was applied to a high-pressure turbine rotor test case where the resonances of interest were due to first torsion and second flap blade modes under 40 engine-order excitation. The forced response computations were conducted using a multi-bladerow approach in order to avoid errors associated with ``linking'' single bladerow computations since the spacing between the bladerows was relatively small. Three friction damper elements, representing one actual friction damper, were used for each rotor blade. The number of rotor blades was decreased by 2--90 to obtain a cyclic sector of 4 stator and 9 stator blades. Such a route allowed the analysis to be conducted on a much smaller domain, hence reducing the computational effort significantly. However, the stator blade geometry was skewed in order to adjust the mass flow rate. Frequency shifts of 3.2{\%} and 20.0{\%} were predicted for the 40 engine-order resonances in torsion and bending modes, respectively. The predicted frequency shifts and the dynamic behaviour of the friction dampers were found to be within the measured range. Furthermore, the measured and predicted blade vibration amplitudes showed a good agreement with available experimental data, indicating that the methodology can be applied to typical industrial problems.},

The constitutive equations include the necessary internal variables to account for the material transformations and are utilized in a one-dimensional finite element procedure that captures the unique shape memory alloy responses of pseudoelasticity and of the shape memory effect at all temperatures, stress levels and loading conditions. Detailed material properties for the alloy used are necessary for the analysis. The solution of the geometrically and physically nonlinear problem is achieved by application of a Newton's method in which a sequence of linear problems is numerically solved. Due to consistent linearization, a quadratic rate of convergence is obtained. Several test cases are presented to illustrate the potential of the finite element procedure. Cases simulating the stress-strain behavior of a bar of shape memory alloy under simple uniaxial loading as well as restrained recovery responses at different temperatures compare well with experimental and analytical results. Two further generalized applications are examined : the use of a shape memory alloy ring as a pipe connector and eigenfrequency tuning of a composite beam with embedded shape memory wires. The results of these analyses correlate well with analytical results and the methodology for use of the finite element procedure in general cases is demonstrated. The finite element procedure is thus shown to be a powerful tool for studying various applications of shape memory alloys. {\copyright} 1993.},

Results demonstrate that it is possible to use this technique to monitor the localized motion of an interface successfully. It is observed that the two beam parts of the studied lap joint separate when undergoing bending vibrations and that there is a clear asymmetry in the response of the left and the right end of the interface. Profilometry indicates that the asymmetry in the response is due to the mesoscale topography of the contact interface, highlighting the importance of accounting for surface features in order to model the nonlinearities of a contact interface accurately.},

The measures to reduce cost in the design and production phase are various: redesign to allow for less complex manufacturing processes, reassessment of quality characteristics without reduction of overall quality (only those characteristics to be maintained which are really critical), acceptance of minor damage in new parts which would be acceptable for repaired parts according to technical standards, assessment of all steps in the production process with respect to their influence on the final product properties, more stabilised manufacturing processes which use only a portion of accepted tolerance bands to reduce the subsequent test effort, change of material. In the service phase, cost reduction can be achieved by optimum exploitation of part's life potential. The means are improvement of the lifing concepts where portions of the crack propagation life may be utilised in addition to the traditionally cleared crack initiation life.

@phdthesis{brul2005,
 abstract = {A mechatronic system is an assembly of technological components, such as a mech-

anism, sensors, actuators, and a control unit. Recently, a number of researchers and

industrial manufacturers have highlighted the potential advantages of lightweight paral-

lel mechanisms with respect to the accuracy, dynamic performances, construction cost,

and transportability issues. The design of a mechatronic system with such a mechanism

requires a multidisciplinary approach, where the mechanical deformations have to be

considered. This thesis proposes two original contributions in this framework.

(i) First, a modular and systematic method is developed for the integrated sim-

ulation of mechatronic systems, which accounts for the strongly coupled dynamics of

the mechanical and non-mechanical components. The equations of motion are formu-

lated using the nonlinear Finite Element approach for the mechanism, and the block

diagram language for the control system. The time integration algorithm relies on

the generalized-

 method, known in structural dynamics. Hence, well-dened concepts

from mechanics and from system dynamics are combined in a unied formulation, with

guaranteed convergence and stability properties. Several applications are treated in the

elds of robotics and vehicle dynamics.

(ii) Usual methods in exible multibody dynamics lead to complex nonlinear mod-

els, not really suitable for control design. Therefore, a systematic nonlinear model reduc-

tion technique is presented, which transforms an initial high-order Finite Element model

into a low-order and explicit model. The order reduction is obtained using the original

concept of Global Modal Parameterization: the motion of the assembled mechanism is

described in terms of rigid and exible modes, which have a global physical interpreta-

tion in the conguration space. The reduction procedure involves the component-mode

technique and an approximation strategy in the conguration space. Two examples are

presented: a four-bar mechanism, and a parallel kinematic machine-tool.

Finally, both simulation and modeling tools are exploited for the dynamic analysis

and the control design of an experimental lightweight manipulator with hydraulic ac-

 abstract = {This paper presents a formalism for the transient simulation of nonsmooth dynamic mechanical systems composed of rigid and flexible bodies, kinematic joints and frictionless contact conditions. The proposed algorithm guarantees the exact satisfaction of the bilateral and unilateral constraints both at position and velocity levels. Thus, it significantly differs from penalty techniques since no penetration is allowed. The numerical scheme is obtained in two main steps. Firstly, a splitting method is used to isolate the contributions of impacts, which shall be integrated with only first-order accuracy, from smooth contributions which can be integrated using a higher order scheme. Secondly, following the idea of Gear, Gupta and Leimkuhler, the equation of motion is reformulated so that the bilateral and unilateral constraints appear both at position and velocity levels. After time discretization, the equation of motion involves two complementarity conditions and it can be solved at each time step using a monolithic semi-smooth Newton method. The numerical behavior of the proposed method is studied and compared to other approaches for a number of numerical examples. It is shown that the formulation offers a unified and valid approach for the description of contact conditions between rigid bodies as well as between flexible bodies. {\copyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

 abstract = {When dealing with complex mechanical systems, the frictional contact is at the origin of significant changes in their dynamic behavior. The presence of frictional contact can give rise to mode-coupling instabilities that produce harmonic friction induced vibrations. Unstable vibrations can reach large amplitude that could compromise the structural and surface integrity of the system and are often associated with annoying noise emission. The study of this kind of dynamic instability has been the subject of many studies ranging from both theoretical and numerical analysis of simple lumped models to numerical and experimental investigation on real mechanical systems, such as automotive brakes, typically affected by such issue. In this paper the numerical analysis of a lumped system constituted by several degrees of freedom in frictional contact with a slider is presented, where the introduction of friction can give rise to an unstable dynamic behavior. Two different approaches are used to investigate the effects of friction forces. The first approach, the Complex Eigenvalues Analysis, allows for calculating the complex eigenvalues of the linear system that can be characterized by a positive real part (i.e. negative modal damping). The complex eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the system are investigated with respect to friction. In the second approach a non linear model has been developed accounting for the stick-slip-detachment behavior at the interface to solve the time history solution and analyze the unstable vibration. The effects of boundary conditions and of system parameters are investigated. Results comparison between the two different approaches highlights how nonlinearities affect the time history solution. The lumped model allows for a detailed analysis of the energy flows between the boundary and the system during self-excited vibrations, which are at the origin of the selection between the predicted unstable mode. {\copyright} 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

 abstract = {This paper surveys the state of the art of modal testing or experimental modal analysis of rotating structures. When applied to ordinary, non--rotating structures, modal testing is considered to be well established. Rotating structures, on the other hand, impose special difficulties when one seeks to obtain the parameters of the dynamical model experimentally. This paper focuses on the necessary experimental techniques and their relationship to the current state of the existing theory. Existing modal analysis methods, models and techniques, and their advantages, limitations and relevance are outlined and compared. In addition, some new developments allowing us to circumvent some of the above--mentioned difficulties are presented.



Rotating machines appear in almost every aspect of our modern life: cars, aeroplanes, vacuum cleaners and steam--turbines all have many rotating structures whose dynamics need to be modelled, analysed and improved. The reliability, stability and the response levels of these machines, predicted by analytical models, are generally not satisfactory until validated by experimentally obtained data. For this purpose, modal testing has to be employed and further advance is essential in order to overcome the difficulties in this area.



In this paper, the differences between the mathematical models used for dynamic analysis of non--rotating and rotating structures are clarified. The implications of the model structure, in the latter case, on the application of modal testing are presented, as this is a point of great importance when experimental modal analysis is employed for rotating structures. Models with different degrees of complexity are being used for different types of rotating machines. A classification of such models is outlined in this work and the underlying assumptions and features are described in terms of a hierarchical complexity. Several applications of modal testing are reported here and some experimental evidence to support the validity of the theory is presented. Desired future activities, which are required to advance the theory and practice of this field, are summarized in conclusion.},

The framework is the classical one of partitioning the coordinate vector into subsets of so-called master and slave coordinates, with the reduced dynamic model to contain only the masters. The objective is to compare the quality of two model-reduction methods: (1) a reduction based on the leading order calculation of the nonlinear master-slave state transformation defining the manifold containing the modes to be represented in the reduced model ({\textquotedbl}NNM-based reduction{\textquotedbl}) and (2) a {\textquotedbl}linear-based reduction{\textquotedbl} utilizing the exact for the linear case master-slave state transformation; the linear-based reduction is equivalent to a modal analysis, but the reduced model is defined in terms of the physical, rather than the modal, coordinates. For the simple, low-order oscillator systems considered as examples, the authors have found the NNM-based reduction, which one would expect to be superior, to suffer degradation in quality in the presence of near (and not so near) three to one internal resonance conditions. The linear-based reduction is much simpler to implement and seems to provide competitive results over wide ranges in the system parameters.

 abstract = {A technique for order reduction of dynamic systems in structural form with static piecewise linear nonlinearities is presented. By utilizing two methods which approximate the nonlinear normal mode (NNM) frequencies and mode shapes, reduced-order models are constructed which more accurately represent the dynamics of the full model than do reduced models obtained via standard linear transformations. One method builds a reduced-order model which is dependent on the amplitude (initial conditions) while the other method results in an amplitude-independent reduced model. The two techniques are first applied to reduce two-degree-of-freedom undamped systems with clearance, deadzone, bang-bang, and saturation stiffness nonlinearities to single-mode reduced models which are compared by direct numerical simulation with the full models. It is then shown via a damped four-degree-of-freedom system with two deadzone nonlinearities that one of the proposed techniques allows for reduction to multi-mode reduced models and can accommodate multiple nonsmooth static nonlinearities with several surfaces of discontinuity. The advantages of the proposed methods include obtaining a reduced-order model which is signal-independent (doesn't require direct integration of the full model), uses a subset of the original physical coordinates, retains the form of the nonsmooth nonlinearities, and closely tracks the actual NNMs of the full model.},

 abstract = {There is a drive towards minimising operating clearances

within turbomachines in order to limit reverse leakage flows

and hence improve their efficiency. This increases the likelihood

of contact occurring between the blade and the casing, which

can give rise to high amplitude vibration. Modelling this in-

teraction represents a significant computational challenge. The

non-linear contact precludes the use of well-established linear

methods, and is also subject to uncertainties: the contact law is

imprecisely known and the exact geometry of imperfections that

trigger contactmay be unknown.

In this paper a novel approach is presented that aims to

account for the uncertainties associated with the non-linearity

in a non-probabilistic way. The worst case is sought, by fram-

ing the systemas a constrained anti-optimisation problem. The

target to be maximised represents a metric of the output of in-

terest. The degrees of freedom of the anti-optimisation are the

non-linear input forces (considered as external loads), and the

constraints are designed to capturewhat is thought to be known

about the non-linear contact law and geometry.

A realistic three-dimensional model of a turbine blade is

used to explore the approach, with contact considered at the

leading and trailing edge. The blade dynamics are described in

terms of a linear transfer function matrix and the target metric

of interest is chosen to be the peak displacement of the contact

points. The non-linearity is taken to result from an offset shaft,

giving a sinusoidal clearance variation. The blade is driven at

constant frequency and the scope of the study is limited to find-

ing bounds on periodic solutions. A variety of constraint condi-

tions are explored that describe aspects of the non-linearity. For

example, only compressive forces are permitted (no tension from

the contact), and the displacement must not exceed the clear-

ance.

The method yields encouraging initial results: constraints

can be identified that give efficient estimates of the upper bound

response of the system as a function of drive frequency. The re-

sults are compared with a benchmark time-domain simulation

and are found to correctly over-predict the response without be-

ing overly conservative. Broad trends are also in agreementwith

the benchmark solution. The proposed method appears to be a

promising approach for efficiently accounting for uncertainties

associated with the non-linearity and thus improving blade de-

Under conditions of internal resonance these effects may bring about complex forms of response where the normal linear resonance of a directly excited mode is absorbed, and indirectly excited modes show simultaneous large non-synchronous responses. In this paper the forced vibration of a system of coupled beams is examined and it is shown that violent non-synchronous torsion and bending vibration observed in such a system may be explained by the existence of quadratic non-linear coupling terms and internal resonance effects between three and four modes. A finite degree of freedom model was formulated and the method of multiple scales was applied. For the case of three-mode interactions stationary solutions were obtained which gave very satisfactory agreement with measured responses, and showed the effects of detuning of the internal resonance. The analysis also gave a clear indication of the cause of strong four-mode interactions but did not yield stationary solutions in this case. Experimental results are included to illustrate the four-mode interactive response. {\copyright} 1986.},

 abstract = {This paper deals with fluid-structure interactions (FSI), involving a blade profile, submitted to different sources of excitations, as if it were included in a real engine. Two forces of excitation will be considered on the NACA 64A010 airfoil, described in : an external force, due to a forced rotation motion of the blade, and an aerodynamic force, induced by fluid flow around the structure. By using the Harmonic Balance Method, the airfoil's motion equation becomes an algebraic problem. Then, this system is solved for each frequency of a chosen range. Therefore, the fluid effect on the translation motion of the profile is studied. To compute the time periodic aerodynamic field, the Time Spectral Method, implemented in the Onera's elsA solver, is used for a fast and efficient resolution. This method relies on a time-integration scheme that turns the resolution of the turbulent Navier-Stokes problem into the resolution of several coupled steady state problems computed at different instants of the time period of the move- ment. The Theodorsen approach with several hypothesis exposed in allows an analytic estimation of the unsteady lift effort. The two approaches are compared for an imposed motion. In order to predict the dynamic behavior of the system, a fully coupled numerical methodology is developed. For each frequency and at each iteration, TSM supplies the flow field which is used by HBM as a nonlinear excitation on the structure to computate a periodic response and conversely, HBM supplies the new deformed mesh used by TSM to compute the flow field. This strategy has the advantage that all computations take place in the spectral domain, allowing thus to find the steady-state behavior of the fluid and the structure without computing any transient state. The analysis provides the Frequency Forced Response. Some frequencies in the range corresponding to a contribution change between structure and fluid damping are precisely highlighted. {\copyright} 2017 ASME.},

For these systems, backbone curves define the resonant peaks in the frequency-displacement plane and give valuable information on the prediction of the frequency response of the system. Previously, it has been shown that bifurcations can occur in the backbone curves. In this paper, we present an analytical method enabling the identification of the conditions under which such bifurcations occur. The method, based on second-order nonlinear normal forms, is also able to provide information on the nature of the bifurcations and how they affect the characteristics of the response. This approach is applied to a two-degree-of-freedom mass, spring, damper system with cubic hardening springs. We use the second-order normal form method to transform the system coordinates and identify which parameter values will lead to resonant interactions and bifurcations of the backbone curves. Furthermore, the relationship between the backbone curves and the complex dynamics of the forced system is shown. {\copyright} 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

The vast majority of vibration harvesting devices use mechanical oscillators to boost the amplitude of vibration; however, this can result in a rather narrow band of excitation over which the harvesting device is effective. One approach proposed to overcome this limitation is to substitute the conventional linear oscillator with an oscillator featuring a non-linear compliance characteristic: these mechanisms produce broader frequency responses. The design and optimization of nonlinear energy harvesting devices is however not trivial and there is no consensus among the publish works that the benefits of non-linear oscillators can be realized in the energy harvesting context. This work attempts to further develop understanding of nonlinear energy harvesters by investigating the optimum resistive load. The definition of an optimal load for the nonlinear device is first considered, given due consideration to bandwidth and stability of the operating point, and comparisons with linear devices is shown. Finally, the issue of multiple solutions in the frequency response is addressed.},

Both static and dynamic aerodynamic conditions, i.e., for accelerating freestream speed, are considered using a linearized aerodynamic model. The main aim of this paper is to provide an in-depth physical understanding of the observed transition between periodic and aperiodic behavior, and the presence of a stable periodic region well below the domain characterized by stable limit cycles. Physical insights towards the forward and backward abrupt transition between aperiodic/chaotic and periodic behavior types appear to be the result of an internal resonance (IR) phenomenon between linear modes followed by a lock-in between linear and nonlinear modes. More specifically, initially a 2:1 IR between linear modes leads to a shift in the frequency composition and dynamic behavior of the system. A secondary effect of the IR can be observed immediately after the exact point of 2:1 IR such that a nonlinear mode locks into a subharmonic of the linear mode which in-turn drives a finite stable periodic region.},

In this paper, some of these difficulties are circumvented by assuming an incremental formulation which results in an ordinary nonlinear problem with single-valued functions, though with an enlargement of the phase space. Consideration is given only to periodic oscillations that are found through the harmonic-balance method with many components; there thus ensues a system of algebraic equations that is solved numerically. Stability is studied by the linearized Poincar{\^A}´ map determined via numerical integration. A simple hysteretic oscillator, that presents degrading and non-degrading behaviour, is considered. The results clearly show that the influence of higher harmonics is far from negligible. While non-degrading oscillators reveal stable behaviour over all the frequency range, in the degrading case there is instability that allows either saddle-node or Hopf bifurcation},

Hence, the stationary response can be studied with the aids of classical tools of nonlinear dynamics, as for example the Poincar{\'e} map. The particular system studied in the paper, based on hysteretic Masing rules, allows the reduction of the dimension of the phase space and the implementation of efficient algorithms. The paper summarises results on one degree of freedom systems and concentrates on a two degree of freedom system as the prototype of many degree of freedom systems. This system has been chosen to be in 1:3 internal resonance situation. Depending on the energy dissipation of the elements restoring force, the response may be more or less complex. The periodic response, described by frequency response curves for various levels of excitation intensity, is highly complex. The coupling produces a strong modification of the response around the first mode resonance, whereas it is negligible around the second mode. Quasi-periodic motion starts bifurcating for sufficiently high values of the excitation intensity; windows of periodic motions are embedded in the dominion of the quasi-periodic motion, as consequence of a locking frequency phenomenon.},

Together with the contact and impact laws formulated as normal cone inclusions, the principle of virtual action directly leads to the measure differential inclusions commonly used in the dynamics of nonsmooth mechanical systems. The discretization of the principle of virtual action in its strong and weak variational form by local finite elements in time provides a structured way to derive various time-stepping schemes. The constitutive laws for the impulsive and nonimpulsive contact forces, ie, the contact and impact laws, are treated on velocity-level by using a discrete contact law for the percussion increments in the sense of Moreau. Using linear shape functions and different quadrature rules, we obtain three different stepping schemes. Besides the well-established Moreau time-stepping scheme, we can present two alternative integrators referred to as symmetric and variational Moreau-type stepping schemes. A suitable benchmark example shows the superiority of the newly proposed integrators in terms of energy conservation properties, accuracy, and convergence.},

It is the case, for example, of the projection of the external load on the vibration modes in the modal analysis of linear systems or of the simulation of multi-correlated time series for a Monte Carlo-based analysis of non-linear structures. The use of the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) introduces some formal simplifications in the solution of the aforementioned problems, but requires the evaluation of the eigenquantities of some statistical representations of the loading process. The knowledge of such quantities in analytic form yields computational advantages and enables important physical interpretations. In the present paper, an analytic expression of POD is developed for a class of processes, which includes models usually adopted to represent the atmospheric turbulence. Examples of linear analysis of a wind-excited slender structure and of simulation of turbulence fields are presented.},

 abstract = {In the present paper the static bending of pre-twisted cantilever blading is examined.

The blading is pre-twisted linearly about the centroid of its cross-section to a maximum

angle of n/2 radians and is considered to be mounted encastr6 at the root. The behaviour

of such blading, particularly when bending under a distributed load, is of considerable

practical importance.

By the application of variational calculus, static equilibrium equations are derived from

expressions for the total potential energy of blades subject to either concentrated or

uniformly distributed bending loads. Solution of the equilibrium equations yields

expressions for the static deflexions. Over a range of pre-twist angles between 0 and n/2

radians deflexions are calculated for blades of (1) narrow rectangular cross-section when

subjected to either method of loading, (2) narrow aerofoil cross-section when subjected to

a uniformly distributed load.

Sets of steel cantilever blades of MITOW rectangular cross-section are loaded laterally

at their free ends and the deflexions determined by measurement. The experimental

values of deflexion compare reasonably with the relevant calculated ones. Small

discrepancies bemeen the two sets of results are not yet fully explained and further

investigation of the problem is under consideration.

For blades where the pre-twist angles do not exceed 7r/2 radians, the agreement

obtained between the two sets of deflexions for the concentrated load system is such that

the validity of the theory, when it is applied to other loading systems, can safely be

assumed without further recourse to experiment.},

is pre-twisted linearly about the centroid of its cross-section up to an angle of {\~{}} / r2ad and

is considered to be mounted encastrC at the root. Accurate prediction of the frequencies of

vibration of such blading is of considerable practical importance.

Two theoretical approaches to the problem are discussed. The first one, involving a

direct solution of the equations of motion, is not made use of, although the characteristic

equations are derived in an appendix for reference. The second approach is based on the

zpplication of Rayleigh's principle. For blades of uniform rectangular cross-section,

frequency equations are derived for the fundamental mod2 of lateral motion and all the

modes of torsional motion. Similar types of equation are shown to apply to aerofoil crosssection

blading since direct coupling effects between bending and torsion, being extremely

small, can be neglected.

Vibration tests were conducted on sets of bladcs of both uniform rectangular and

uniform aerofoil cross-section pre-twisted between 0 and 7r/2 rad, the objects being to

determine the frequencies and corresponding nodal patterns contained within a specified

frequency band. The effect of pre-twist on the measured frequencies of the lateral, torsional,

and, for the aerofoil cross-section, coupled modes of vibration is shown, with certain

exceptions, to be considerable.

For the modes of motion where a theoretical solution is provided, reasonable agreement

is sho*wn to exist between the calculated and corresponding measured frequencies. Hence,

the use of Rayleigh's method is justified, giving, as it does, relatively simple expressions

for the natural frequencies of vibration.

The torsional frequencies of pre-twisted blades are dependent on the torsional stiffness

values. Hence, a theoretical study of torsional stiffness variation with pre-twist is presented,

the results obtained being confirmed experimentally by a series of simple torsion tests.},

 abstract = {A new approach to enforce surface contact conditions in transient non-linear finite element problems is developed in this paper. The method is based on the Lagrange multiplier concept and is compatible with explicit time integration operators. Compatibility with explicit operators is established by referencing Lagrange multipliers one time increment ahead of associated surface contact displacement constraints. However, the method is not purely explicit because a coupled system of equations must be solved to obtain the Lagrange multipliers. An important development herein is the formulation of a highly efficient method to solve the Lagrange multiplier equations. The equation solving strategy is a modified Gauss-Seidel method in which non-linear surface contact force conditions are enforced during iteration. The new surface contact method presented has two significant advantages over the widely accepted penalty function method: surface contact conditions are satisfied more precisely, and the method does not adversely affect the numerical stability of explicit integration. Transient finite element analysis results are presented for problems involving impact and sliding with friction. A brief review of the classical Lagrange multiplier method with implicit integration is also included.},

 abstract = {Engineering structures seldom behave linearly and, as a result, linearity checks are common practice in the testing of critical structures exposed to dynamic loading to define the boundary of validity of the linear regime. However, in large scale industrial applications, there is no general methodology for dynamicists to extract nonlinear parameters from measured vibration data so that these can be then included in the associated numerical models. In this paper, a simple method based on the information contained in the frequency response function (FRF) properties of a structure is studied. This technique falls within the category of single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) modal analysis methods. The principle upon which it is based is effectively a linearisation whereby it is assumed that at given amplitude of displacement response the system responds at the same frequency as the excitation and that stiffness and damping are constants. In so doing, by extracting this information at different amplitudes of vibration response, it is possible to estimate the amplitude-dependent `natural' frequency and modal loss factor. Because of its mathematical simplicity and practical implementation during standard vibration testing, this method is particularly suitable for practical applications. In this paper, the method is illustrated and new analyses are carried out to validate its performance on numerical simulations before applying it to data measured on a complex aerospace test structure as well as a full-scale helicopter.},

 abstract = {Anti Vibration Mounts (AVMs) are very common passive vibration isolation devices used in a variety of engineering applications. These are, in most cases, off-the-shelf items which engineers select on the basis of the manufacturer's specifications (in particular the dynamic stiffness). However, only seldom the nominal values of the stiffness of AVMs (especially that of elastomeric mounts) are close to those measured. It can be argued that the main reason for the disagreement is the nonlinear characteristic of the mounts. In practice, the difference between nominal and measured stiffness value can cause major problems to engineers. In fact, in many engineering applications, structures are required to be tested for clearance or certification purposes (e.g. hardware items on helicopters): if an AVM has been selected on the basis of its nominal stiffness its choice may present problems when these are excited at high amplitude of vibration, when the nonlinear behaviour becomes pronounced. In this paper an existing identification method based on Frequency Response Function (FRF) data is shown to be applicable also when transmissibility is measured. Transmissibility is a frequency-dependent, non-dimensional, function which is particularly useful especially when the test item is excited at the base. In this article, the applicability of the method is first demonstrated using numerical simulations. Subsequently, it is shown that the method allows extraction of amplitude-dependent stiffness characteristics of the mount from standard dynamic tests. This enables calculation of stiffness functions and building of a more refined numerical model of the system. The advanced model is used to predict the system's response which compares well with measured data.},

@article{Carstens.2003,
 abstract = {The aeroelastic behaviour of vibrating blade assemblies is usually investigated in the frequency domain where the determination of aeroelastic stability boundaries is separated from the computation of linearized unsteady aerodynamic forces. However, nonlinear fluid-structure interaction caused by oscillating shocks or strong flow separation may significantly influence the aerodynamic damping and hence effect a shift of stability boundaries. In order to investigate such aeroelastic phenomena, the governing equations of structural and fluid motion have to be simultaneously integrated in time. In this paper a technique is presented which analyses the flutter behaviour of turbomachinery bladings in the time domain. The structural part of the governing aeroelastic equations is time-integrated according to the algorithm of Newmark, while the unsteady airloads are computed at every time step by a Navier-Stokes code. The link between the two time integrations is an automatic grid generation in which the used mesh is dynamically deformed so that it conforms with the deflected blades at every time step. The computed time series of the aeroelastic simulation of an assembly of highly loaded compressor blades vibrating freely in transonic flow are presented. The energy transfer between fluid and structure is here dominated by vibrating shocks and shock-boundary layer interaction. It is investigated if the predicted aeroelastic stability boundaries differ from those of a linearised method. {\copyright} 2003 Published by {\'E}ditions scientifiques et m{\'e}dicales Elsevier SAS.},

Since for a given restoring force the nonlinear response is affected by the oscillation amplitude, frequency-response curves for various excitation levels are constructed. The curve of periodic solutions for increasing excitation amplitude has been investigated analyzing the evolution of the resonance frequencies. Furthermore, in addition to known behaviors, to some extent already observed for single-degree-of-freedom hysteretic oscillators, a richer class of solutions and bifurcations is found for a 2-DOF system. New branches of stable periodic oscillations are bifurcated where conditions of internal resonance are encountered by varying the excitation amplitude; these are characterized by the onset of novel modes with an oscillation shape significantly different than that of modes on the fundamental branch. Finally, comparison between systems close to and far from internal resonance allowed to enlighten the role of the nonlinear coupling in the vibration mitigation.},

A combined numerical--experimental approach was used to identify the mass, stiffness and damping effects of a real bolted joint.

Specifically, amplitude-frequency plots for the conservative limit have often been noted, both numerically and experimentally, to serve as backbone curves for the near resonance peaks of the forced response. In other cases, such a relationship between the unforced and forced response was not observed. Here we provide a systematic mathematical analysis that predicts which members of conservative periodic orbit families will serve as backbone curves for the forced-damped response. We also obtain mathematical conditions under which approximate numerical and experimental approaches, such as energy balance and force appropriation, are justifiable. Finally, we derive analytic criteria for the birth of isolated response branches (isolas) whose identification is otherwise challenging from numerical continuation.},

 abstract = {The Wave-Based Substructuring (WBS), as an alternative to the conventional Component Mode Synthesis

(CMS) approaches in structural dynamics, is used to gain dynamical properties of an assembly through

spatial coupling of two or more sub-components. The WBS has been recently developed in order to speedup

the numerical computations while retaining acceptable accuracy of the results of the assembly. The

WBS approach involves calculation, modification and selection of a limited set of basis functions that, in

the frequency range of interest, properly describe the behavior of the coupling interface between the subcomponents.

This limited set of basis functions is then used in a spatial-domain coupling resulting in a much

lower number of equations than one would get in the case of the conventional CMS methods. This feature

makes the WBS especially appealing in iterative-based numerical calculations like in structural-dynamic

modification studies or in optimization. However, as the basis functions are dependent on the full-assembly's

properties, and since these properties are generally changing when there is some modification in one or more

sub-components, the issue of robustness of the basis functions is addressed in this paper. The paper also

exposes some other issues in the basis-function calculation, namely selection and sensitivity. A new scalar

function criterion to asses the quality of synthesis or coupling in general is also proposed. The industrial

applicability is demonstrated on an industrial-sized, automotive test case.},

 abstract = {Vibro-impact (VI) based control strategies exploit non-linear phenomena occurring during impacts between oscillating masses and vibrating structures to mitigate vibrations. They are known to be effective on a wide frequency range, in harsh environnement, and they are eco-friendly in comparison to some visco-elastic polymers used for the same application. Different assumptions emerge to explain energy dissipation such as material and contact effects, or dynamic energy transfers between the structure and the oscillating masses acting as non-linear absorbers. As classical vibratory measurement tools do not allow to accurately and easily measure what happens in the contact area and the motion of the absorber, it is difficult to validate and quantify the phenomenon. The purpose of the study is to take advantage of full field measurements of the vibro-impact phenomenon to characterise a vibro-impact absorber and to better understand the interactions occurring during impact. To reach this objective, a dedicated experimental set-up has been designed and a method involving Digital Image Correlation (DIC) and a high-speed camera is used to capture and reconstruct the motion of the oscillating mass. The characterisation allows to estimate the Coefficient Of Restitution (COR) and friction forces, and provides data that are used in two different contact modelling strategies based on the COR and on the Hertz contact theory. The quantities identified in this paper enable to better understand the physical phenomena at stakes in a VI absorber.},

 abstract = {High-cycle fatigue (HCF) is arguably one of the costliest sources of in-service damage in military aircraft engines. HCF of turbine blades and disks can pose a significant engine risk because fatigue failure can result from resonant vibratory stresses sustained over a relatively short time. A common approach to mitigate HCF risk is to avoid dangerous resonant vibration modes (first bending and torsion modes, etc.) and instabilities (flutter and rotating stall) in the operating range. However, it might be impossible to avoid all the resonance for all flight conditions. In this paper, a methodology is presented to assess the influences of HCF loading on the fracture risk of gas turbine engine components subjected to fretting fatigue. The methodology is based on an integration of a global finite element analysis of the disk-blade assembly, numerical solution of the singular integral equations using the CAPRI (Contact Analysis for Profiles of Random Indenters) and Worst Case Fret methods, and risk assessment using the DARWIN (Design Assessment of Reliability with Inspection) probabilistic fracture mechanics code. The methodology is illustrated for an actual military engine disk under real life loading conditions.},

For the application to vibration analysis, the approach of superelement (SE) in combination with reduction techniques such as component mode synthesis (CMS) has been successfully employed. Besides by increasing the size of FE models to include as much detail as possible, the most practical way for obtaining accurate FE models is by correlating with experimental modal data.

In this paper the correlation process is described for the case study of a full 3D aircraft engine model. Modal testing data have been acquired on individual engine casings, subassembly of casings as well as the full assembly. All the data are used in a step-by-step model validation process. The ``almost axi-symmetric'' casings cause complication in the form of mode pairs and ``rotated'' mode shapes. A method that is based on rotation of mode shapes for the mode pairs is applied to improve the correlation.

The high modal density of the full engine model is exemplified in two ways: (1) large number of modes which are closely spaced in frequency and (2) a mix of ``global'' and ``local'' modes which are complicated by the ``almost axi-symmetric'' cylindrical shell-type casing structure. In order to overcome these challenges, a method of selecting significant modes is introduced.},

The maximum blade forced response amplitudes are often much larger than those of their perfectly tuned counterparts, which leads to eventual failure via high cycle fatigue (HCF). Therefore, it is of great importance to predict and, ultimately, to reduce the blade forced response levels as a result of random mistuning. In this paper, intentional mistuning is introduced into a simplified 12-bladed disk model by varying the stiffness of the blades in periodic harmonic patterns. The individual and combined effects of intentional mistuning, coupling and damping are examined in the absence and presence of random mistuning through numerical study. It is found that there is some threshold value of intentional mistuning and coupling that leads to maximum mistuning effects and certain relations among intentional mistuning strength, integer harmonics, coupling and damping can suppress the response levels of mistuned bladed disks, which provides useful guidelines for safe and reliable designs of bladed disk systems.},

In this paper the impact of friction in blade attachments on forced response is investigated both numerically and experimentally. An efficient multiharmonic balance method is proposed in order to compute the forced response of bladed disks with contact and friction nonlinearities in blade roots. For experimental validation purposes, a rotating bladed disk was tested in a vacuum chamber, with excitation being provided by piezoelectric actuators. A model of the rig was built and numerical results were obtained with a normal load dependent coefficient of friction and a constant material damping ratio. Nonlinear behavior observed experimentally at resonances was well reproduced and an acceptable correlation was found with experimental resonant frequencies, amplitudes, and amount of damping throughout the spinning speed and excitation level range. The proposed numerical method can therefore serve to enhance the prediction of the alternating stresses in bladed disk assemblies.},

These analytical developments are used to provide evidence of transfer of vibratory energy of the main system to the chain in the form of localized modes during periodic regimes and extreme energy exchanges between modes when the overall structure faces singularities. Furthermore, analytical predictions at slow time scale and nonlinear normal modes of the system are compared with numerical results obtained from direct time integration of the system equations, showing a good agreement between them.

For example, rotordynamics deals with the shaft behavior while bladed assemblies dynamics deals with wheels, and the possibility of interaction between those elements is generally not analyzed.



In this study, the global non-rotating mode shapes of flexible bladed disc--shaft assemblies are used in a modal analysis method for calculating the dynamic characteristics (frequencies and mode shapes) of the corresponding rotating system. The non-rotating mode shapes are computed using a finite element cyclic symmetry approach. Rotational effects, such as centrifugal stiffening and gyroscopic effects, are accounted for. All the possible couplings between the flexible parts and every kind of deformations are allowed. The proposed model is applied to a thin-walled composite shaft and to a turbomolecular pump rotating assembly. The results obtained illustrate clearly some of the limitations of classical approaches.},

 abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of vibrations of a cracked beam. In general, the motion of such a beam can be very complex. This phenomenon can be attributed to the presence of the non-linearity due to the opening and closing of cracks. The focus of this paper is the modal analysis of a cantilever beam with a transverse edge crack. The non-linearity mentioned above has been modelled as a piecewise-linear system. In an attempt to define effective natural frequencies for this piecewise-linear system, the idea of a ``bilinear frequency'' is utilized. The bilinear frequency is obtained by computing the associated frequencies of each of the linear pieces of the piecewise-linear system. The finite element method is used to obtain the natural frequencies in each linear region.

In order better to understand the essential non-linear dynamics of the cracked beam, a piecewise-linear two-degree-of-freedom model is studied. Perturbation methods are used to obtain the non-linear normal modes of vibration and the associated period of the motion. Results of this piecewise-linear model problem are shown to justify the definition of the bilinear frequency as the effective natural frequency. It is therefore expected that calculating piecewise mode shapes and bilinear frequencies is useful for understanding the dynamics of the infinite degree of freedom cracked beam.},

 abstract = {A dimension reduction method called discrete empirical interpolation is proposed and shown to dramatically reduce the computational complexity of the popular proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method for constructing reduced-order models for time dependent and/or parametrized nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). In the presence of a general nonlinearity, the standard POD-Galerkin technique reduces dimension in the sense that far fewer variables are present, but the complexity of evaluating the nonlinear term remains that of the original problem. The original empirical interpolation method (EIM) is a modification of POD that reduces the complexity of evaluating the nonlinear term of the reduced model to a cost proportional to the number of reduced variables obtained by POD. We propose a discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM), a variant that is suitable for reducing the dimension of systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of a certain type. As presented here, it is applicable to ODEs arising from finite difference discretization of time dependent PDEs and/or parametrically dependent steady state problems. However, the approach extends to arbitrary systems of nonlinear ODEs with minor modification. Our contribution is a greatly simplified description of the EIM in a finite-dimensional setting that possesses an error bound on the quality of approximation. An application of DEIM to a finite difference discretization of the one-dimensional FitzHugh-Nagumo equations is shown to reduce the dimension from 1024 to order 5 variables with negligible error over a long-time integration that fully captures nonlinear limit cycle behavior. We also demonstrate applicability in higher spatial dimensions with similar state space dimension reduction and accuracy results. {\copyright} 2010 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},

Though there are huge applications of these methods, it still remains much less understood in their relationship and error estimation. In this study, we proved that they are equivalent if time points are uniformly chosen. Based on this property, more importantly, the error was analytically estimated for both discrete Fourier expansion (DFE) and CM. Furthermore, we revealed that the accuracy of frequency domain solutions cannot be improved by increasing the number of time points alone, whereas it absolutely depends upon the truncated number of harmonics. It indicates that an appropriate number of time points should be chosen in FSE if frequency domain solutions are targeted for nonlinear dynamical systems, especially those with complicated functions.},

 abstract = {In the present study, the dynamics of one- and two-degree-of-freedom linear oscillators attached to hierarchical chains of oscillators coupled by strongly nonlinear cubic springs in parallel with viscous dampers are investigated. The mass, stiffness, and damping properties of the nonlinear oscillators are specified to follow a certain scaling rule, in such a way that their mass, stiffness, and damping properties decrease along the chain. The linear oscillators are driven harmonically near to their primary resonances. For sufficiently low excitation levels, linear behavior prevails leading to nearly harmonic responses, where the mechanical energy remains localized in the directly forced linear oscillator. For sufficiently high excitation level (that is, above a critical level of the forcing amplitude), however, the system responds in a chaotic way, where a substantial part of the energy is transferred across the hierarchical nonlinear chain in an energy cascade. Interestingly, there exist ``chaotic bands'' where all cubic oscillators are simultaneously activated or deactivated depending on the frequency; hence, a chaotic synchronization occurs in the system. When energy cascading is initiated the smaller-scale cubic oscillators become driven by the chaotic dynamics of the larger-scale cubic oscillators. Once the oscillator chain enters the chaotic response regime, the pattern of nonlinear energy cascading resembles (but is not identical to) the --5/3 Kolmogorov energy cascading power law observed in fully developed turbulence. Similarities and differences in the observed mechanical energy cascades and those realized in turbulent flows are discussed.},

 abstract = {Many mechanical systems have moving components that are mutually constrained through frictional contacts. When subjected to cyclic excitations, a contact interface may undergo constant changes among sticks, slips and separations, which leads to very complex contact kinematics. In this paper, a 3-D friction contact model is employed to predict the periodic forced response of structures having 3-D frictional constraints. Analytical criteria based on this friction contact model are used to determine the transitions among sticks, slips and separations of the friction contact, and subsequently the constrained force which consists of the induced stick--slip friction force on the contact plane and the contact normal load. The resulting constrained force is often a periodic function and can be considered as a feedback force that influences the response of the constrained structures. By using the Multi-Harmonic Balance Method along with Fast Fourier Transform, the constrained force can be integrated with the receptance of the structures so as to calculate the forced response of the constrained structures. It results in a set of non-linear algebraic equations that can be solved iteratively to yield the relative motion as well as the constrained force at the friction contact. This method is used to predict the periodic response of a frictionally constrained 3-d.o.f. oscillator. The predicted results are compared with those of the direct time integration method so as to validate the proposed method. In addition, the effect of super-harmonic components on the resonant response and jump phenomenon is examined.},

@phdthesis{chen2001c,
 abstract = {This thesis describes studies of finite element (FE) model validation methods for

structural dynamics. There are usually discrepancies between predictions of the

structural dynamic properties based on an initial FE model and those yielded by

experimental data from tests on the actual structure. In order to make predictions from

the model suitable for evaluating the dynamic properties of the structure, and thus to

optimise its design, the model has to be validated. The process of model validation and

the individual steps that make up this process are studied through theoretical analysis

and case studies.

A general strategy for model validation is presented in the introduction to the

thesis, describing the validation process as a sequence of distinct steps. A study of the

strategy presented at the end of the thesis shows multiple approaches for model

validation. Using experience obtained from validating models of example structures for

constructing and validating the model of a new design of a similar structure could

accelerate the process of FE model validation, and therefore benefit industry by

reducing the time of the design-examine-redesign loop.

Through case studies, a new perspective on the performance of model updating

is presented in this work showing that model updating can only minimise the

discrepancies caused by parameter errors in the model. However, model updating

procedures cannot reduce discrepancies caused by discretisation errors and/or

configuration errors without losing the physical meaning of the updating parameters. In

order to make sure that a model is suitable for being subjected to the updating step, the

model must first be verified. Two verification methods, a convergence check by using

two different formulae for constructing the mass matrix of each element and a

configuration check by projecting experimental mode shapes onto the subspace spanned

by FE model predicted eigenvectors, are proposed to deal with discretisation errors and

configuration errors respectively in FE models.

In addition, this thesis presents research findings and ideas dealing with

correlation and testing for the purpose of model validation. Special attention is given to

the correlation performance for quasi-axisymmetric structures in order to get a {\textquotedbl}true{\textquotedbl}

representation of the correlation by numerical parameters. Studies of test-planning and

modal testing are also focused on cases with quasi-axisymmetric structures.},

The analytical theory for the optimal impact control algorithms for impact damper is developed, and the accurate expressions are derived for the optimal values of the impact damper damping and initial displacement in a single-degree-of-freedom structure. The relation between coefficient of restitution and impact damping ratio is obtained. The investigation shows that the effective reduction of the vibration response is nearly independent of the number of impacts, but primarily related to the type of collision which the impact mass collides with the main mass face-to-face. This theory is generalized to continuous structures. An example of an impact damper in a rotating cantilever beam demonstrates that the impact dampers are suitable for attenuating the impulse response of structures unconditional stable without the requirement of the accuracy of the modal information.},

One approach to this problem is to employ high-order discretization methods in time and space. For spatial discretization the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method is particularly attractive as it delivers high order accuracy in the context of unstructured meshes. To fully exploit the advantages of the basic DG method it is important to develop accurate boundary conditions on both the physical and artificial boundaries of the computational domains. In this work we present a DG solver for 2D Euler flows with special emphasis on the implementation of robust and accurate boundary conditions for turbomachinery applications. The DG solver supports triangular and quadrilateral elements. The spatial discretization is based on Roe's numerical fluxes and polynomial basis functions of degree p $\leq$ 3, i.e., up to fourth order accuracy. Both explicit and implicit time integration schemes are implemented for unsteady simulations. Steady solutions are obtained using an implicit pseudo-time marching technique.},

The aim of this paper is to determine to what extent microslip due to the combined non-linearities along the normal and the tangent of non-conforming contact surfaces influences the damper behavior. The ultimate goal is to determine whether introducing these features in the contact model would improve the performance of numerical routines used at the blade-damper design stage. In order to explore this problem, a purposely developed contact model is tuned on a single-contact test and then included in the numerical model of a curved-flat damper to simulate its cylindrical interface. The damper numerical routine is then validated against the results from an experimental device purposely developed to test the dynamics of a damper loaded between moving platforms. It is shown that the validated numerical routine featuring the newly introduced contact model predicts, in comparison with the standard contact model (where partial slip and normal approach non-linearity are not considered), a lower dissipated energy by an amount that would not be justifiable to neglect.},

The unsteady static pressures were obtained with high frequency Kulite transducers mounted on the casing upstream and downstream of the fan. The casing pressure variation was clearly visible in the measurements when a stall cell passed below the transducers. Numerical stall simulations were conducted using an implicit, time-accurate, 3D compressible Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solver. The comparisons between the experiment and simulation mainly cover performance curves and time-domain pressure traces of Kulites during rotating stall. At two different fan speeds, the stall characteristics such as the number and rotating speed of the stall cells were well-matched to the experimental values. The mass flow rate and the loading parameter under the fully-developed rotating stall also showed good agreement with the experiment. In both the numerical and experimental results, a large stall cell was eventually formed after stall inception regardless of the fan speed. Based on the validation, the detailed flow has been evaluated to understand rotating stall in a transonic fan. In addition, it was found that the mass flow measurement using casing static pressure might be wrong during transient flow if the Kulites were mounted too close to the fan blade. {\copyright} 2013 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.},

 abstract = {This work presents a frequency-domain technique that extends the concept of linear modal super position to nonlinear systems by using the normal nonlinear mode approach so that a generalized parameter identification method can be formulated for MDOF nonlinear systems. The methodology is compatible with existing established vibration analysis techniques such as finite element (FE) modeling and experimental modal analysis. Furthermore, once the nonlinear modal parameters are identified at some reference force level, the nonlinear response can be predicted at any arbitrary excitation level using standard modal sum mation techniques. The numerical study is focused on a 4-DOF system with friction damping nonlinearity, for which both the macro- and microslip representations are considered. Simulated nonlinear frequency re sponse functions, obtained for a given excitation level using a harmonic balance method, were subjected to a nonlinear modal analysis procedure, and the modal parameters were extracted as a function of the vibration amplitude. Micro- and macroslip representations yielded significantly different nonlinear modal parameters, though the findings were consistent with those of other researchers. The nonlinear modal analysis results and the response predictions at arbitrary forcing levels were compared against reference harmonic balance sim ulations, and very good agreement was observed for all cases investigated. It was verified that the friction damper produced highest damping for the vibration amplitude of maximum energy dissipation.},

 abstract = {This paper deals with the formulation of a frequency domain modal analysis technique that is applicable to weakly non-linear multi-degree of freedom (MDOF) systems with well-separated modes. The concept of linear modal superposition is combined with the normal non-linear mode technique, an approach that allows the formulation of a system identification procedure in terms of variable modal parameters. The numerical study was focused on a 4-DOF system with cubic stiffness non-linearity, and the modal parameters were obtained as functions of the modal amplitude. It was shown that the methodology was well suited to the study of practical cases for which the underlying linear model may be approximate. Similarly, the technique was found to be robust in the presence of measurement noise, though some adverse effects were observed for high noise levels. Once the variable modal parameters were extracted at some given force level, the non-linear responses were predicted at other force levels via synthesis of normal non-linear modes. The same responses were also obtained using a harmonic balance approach and very good agreement was obtained between the two sets of results. The procedure is well suited to the study of industrial cases because of its compatibility with existing finite element methods and linear modal analysis techniques.},

A beam system with cubic stiffness type non-linearity was used in the experimental study. The non-linear response was measured at three locations and the underlying linear system was obtained via linear modal analysis of low-excitation response data. The non-linear parameter variations were obtained as a function of the modal amplitude and the response of the system was generated for other force levels. The results were found to agree very well with the corresponding measurements, indicating the success of the non-linear modal analysis methodology, even in the presence of true experimental noise. An advanced numerical case study that included both inherent structural damping and non-linear friction damping, was considered next. The linear finite element model of a high-pressure turbine blade was used in conjunction with three local non-linear friction damper elements. It was shown that the response of the system could be predicted at any force level, provided that that non-linear modal parameters were available at some reference force level. The predicted response levels were compared against those obtained from reference simulations and very good agreement was achieved in all cases.},

 abstract = {This paper reviews the status of smart structures technology development for application to rotorcraft systems. Though a large component of research is focused on the minimization of helicopter vibration, the methodology is equally applicable to such other problems as aeromechanical stability augmentation, handling qualities enhancement, stall alleviation, reduction of interior/exterior acoustic signatures, minimization of blade dynamic stresses and rotor head health monitoring. More than any other system, the structural, mechanical and aerodynamic complexity and the interdisciplinary nature of rotorcraft offer many opportunities for the application of smart structures technologies with the potential for substantial payoffs in system effectiveness. Primarily, two types of smart rotor concepts are under development: trailing-edge flaps actuated with smart actuators, and controllable twist blades with embedded piezoceramic actuators. For flap actuation, actuators range from piezo-bimorphs, piezo/electrostrictive stacks and piezo/magnetostrictive-induced composite-coupled actuation. Most smart actuators are moderate force and extremely small displacement devices and hence some form of mechanical amplification of induced displacement is needed to achieve desired flap deflections. Because of compactness and weight considerations, the stroke amplification of these devices has been a key barrier for application to rotor blades. Most of the current smart rotor models under development have adopted Froude scaling, but future developments are tending towards Mach-scale and full-scale designs. The state-of-art on modeling of actuators is improving rapidly. Shape memory alloys (SMA) show potential in providing large induced strains (up to 6{\%}), but are limited to low frequency (less than 1 Hz) applications such as tab adjustment for rotor tracking. Also, it is quite difficult to achieve fine-tune actuation control with SMAs. Database of smart actuator characteristics under different loads, frequency and temperature are non-existent. For in-flight tracking of rotor SMA-actuated tabs, it is important to incorporate adaptive control strategy and a locking mechanism. Comprehensive rotor analyses covering smart materials actuators are in development at this time. This paper will identify key barriers for applications of smart structure technology to rotorcraft systems and point out the need for future research in this area. Research in the application of smart structures technology to rotorcraft systems is in its early phase, and activities need to be expanded before this promising technology can be exploited in a competitive manner.},

Especially in the case of geometric nonlinearities, dealing with very flexible, very light structures causes minimal variations in mass or stiffness to affect severely the dynamical response. Thus, sensors' added masses change the behaviour of the structure with respect to the unloaded condition. Moreover, the most common tools regularly employed for acquisition in vibration analysis - that is to say, laser vibrometers and accelerometers - are often designed with small amplitudes in mind. Their recordings are known to lack accuracy when the investigated structure undergoes large or very large motions, due to geometrical reasons. Image-based measurement techniques offer a valid solution to this problem. Here, an ensemble of three video processing techniques are benchmarked against each other and tested as viable options for the non-contact dynamic characterisation of slender beam-like structures. The methods have been applied to the case study of an aluminium spar for a highly-flexible airwing prototype and compared to the measurements recorded by a laser velocimeter and several Raspberry PI Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs), which also proved to be minimally invasive.},

Indeed, the sensors placement introduces a certain amount of geometric hardening and mass variation, which becomes relevant for very flexible structures. The effects of mass loading, while highly recognised to be much larger in the nonlinear domain than in its linear counterpart, have seldom been explored experimentally. In this context, the aim of this paper is to perform a noncontact, full-field nonlinear investigation of the very light and very flexible XB-1 air wing prototype aluminum spar, applying the well-known resonance decay method. Video processing in general, and a high-speed, optical target tracking technique in particular, are proposed for this purpose; the methodology can be easily extended to any slender beam-like or plate-like element. Obtained results have been used to describe the first nonlinear normal mode of the spar in both unloaded and sensors-loaded conditions by means of their respective backbone curves. Noticeable changes were encountered between the two conditions when the structure undergoes large-amplitude flexural vibrations.},

 abstract = {Combining the harmonic balance method (HBM) and a continuation method is a well-known technique to follow the periodic solutions of dynamical systems when a control parameter is varied. However, since deriving the algebraic system containing the Fourier coefficients can be a highly cumbersome procedure, the classical HBM is often limited to polynomial (quadratic and cubic) nonlinearities and/or a few harmonics. Several variations on the classical HBM, such as the incremental HBM or the alternating frequency/time-domain HBM, have been presented in the literature to overcome this shortcoming. Here, we present an alternative approach that can be applied to a very large class of dynamical systems (autonomous or forced) with smooth equations. The main idea is to systematically recast the dynamical system in quadratic polynomial form before applying the HBM. Once the equations have been rendered quadratic, it becomes obvious to derive the algebraic system and solve it by the so-called asymptotic numerical method (ANM) continuation technique. Several classical examples are presented to illustrate the use of this numerical approach.},

 abstract = {The Finite Element Method (FEM), Experimental modal analysis (EMA) and other linear analysis techniques have been established as reliable tools for the dynamic analysis of engineering structures. They are often used to provide solutions to small and large structures and other variety of cases in structural dynamics, even those exhibiting a certain degree of nonlinearity. Unfortunately, when the nonlinear effects are substantial or the accuracy of the predicted response is of vital importance, a linear finite element model will generally prove to be unsatisfactory. As a result, the validated linear FE model requires further enhancement so that it can represent and predict the nonlinear behaviour exhibited by the structure. In this paper, a pragmatic approach to integrating test-based system identification and FE modelling of a nonlinear structure is presented. This integration is based on three different phases: the first phase involves the derivation of an Underlying Linear Model (ULM) of the structure, the second phase includes experiment-based nonlinear identification using measured time series and the third phase covers augmenting the linear FE model and experimental validation of the nonlinear FE model. The proposed case study is demonstrated on a twin cantilever beam assembly coupled with a flexible arch shaped beam. In this case, polynomial-type nonlinearities are identified and validated with force-controlled stepped-sine test data at several excitation levels.},

 abstract = {Most nonlinear identification problems often require prior knowledge or an initial assumption of the mathematical law (model structure) and data processing to estimate the nonlinear parameters present in a system, i.e. they require the functional form or depend on a proposition that the measured data obey a certain nonlinear function. However, obtaining prior knowledge or performing nonlinear characterisation can be difficult or impossible for certain identification problems due to the individualistic nature of practical nonlinearities. For example, joints between substructures of large aerospace design frequently feature complex physics at local regions of the structure, making a physically motivated identification in terms of nonlinear stiffness and damping impossible. As a result, black-box models which use no prior knowledge can be regarded as an effective method. This paper explores the pragmatism of a black-box approach based on Polynomial Nonlinear State Space (PNLSS) models to identify the nonlinear dynamics observed in a large aerospace component. As a first step, the Best Linear Approximation (BLA), noise and nonlinear distortion levels are estimated over different amplitudes of excitation using the Local Polynomial Method (LPM). Next, a linear state space model is estimated on the non-parametric BLA using the frequency domain subspace identification method. Nonlinear model terms are then constructed in the form of multivariate polynomials in the state variables while the parameters are estimated through a nonlinear optimisation routine. Further analyses were also conducted to determine the most suitable monomial degree and type required for the nonlinear identification procedure. Practical application is carried out on an Aero-Engine casing assembly with multiple joints, while model estimation and validation is achieved using measured sine-sweep and broadband data obtained from the experimental campaign.},

The actuators consistof two electrodes: one exposed to the air and the other covered by a dielectric material. The electrodes are supplied with an alternating current voltage that, at high enough levels, causes the air over the covered electrode to ionize. The ionized air, in the presence of the electric field produced by the electrode geometry, results in a body force vector that acts on the ambient air. The body force is the mechanism for active aerodynamic control. The plasma generation is a dynamic process within the alternating current cycle. The body force per unit volume of plasma has been derived from first principles and implemented in numerical flow simulations. Models for the time and space dependence of the body force on the input voltage amplitude, frequency, electrode geometry, and dielectric properties have been developed and used along with experiments to optimize actuator performance. This paper presents results that highlight the plasma actuator characteristics and modeling approach.

 abstract = {The aerodynamic damping of a modern low pressure turbine bladed-disk with interlock rotor blades is compared for the first time to that obtained when the rotor blades are welded in pairs through the lateral face of the shroud. The damping is computed solving the linearized Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations on a moving grid. First the basics of the stabilizing mechanism of welding the rotor blades in pairs is investigated using two-dimensional analyses and the Panovsky and Kielb method. It is concluded that the stabilizing effect is due to the suppression of unsteady perturbations in one out of the two passages providing for the first time a physical explanation to engine data. Three-dimensional effects are then studied using the actual mode shapes of two bladed disks differing solely in the shroud boundary conditions. It is concluded that the increase in the aerodynamic damping, due to the modification of the mode shapes caused by welding the rotor blades in pairs, is smaller than that due to the overall raise of the reduced frequencies of a bladed disk with an interlock design. The modification of the flutter boundaries due to mistuning effects is assessed using the reduced order model known as the Fundamental Mistuning Model. A novel extension of the critical reduced frequency stability maps accounting for mistuning effects is derived and applied for both, the freestanding and welded-in-pair airfoils. The stabilizing effect of mistuning is clearly seen in these maps. Finally, the effect of mistuning on low-pressure-turbine bladed disks is studied. It is shown that the modification on the stability limit of the interlock bladed disk is negligible, while for the welded-in-pair configuration a 0.15{\%} increase of the damping relative to the critical damping is found. This qualitative difference between both configurations had not been reported before.},

The method assumes that the forcing is due solely to the self-excitation of the airfoil and that the vibration amplitude is small enough to represent the unsteady aerodynamics associated to the airfoil motion using the linearized Navier-Stokes equations. The vibration amplitude is saturated due to the non-linearity of fir-tree dry friction which is modelled using a simplified approach. To compensate for the limitations of the friction model several hypotheses need to be done, among them, the geometric similarity of the different configurations and that the aspect ratio of the rotor blades is high.

The analysis is focused on a simplified case whose dynamics is representative of a high aspect ratio low-pressure turbine rotor blade. A parametric study is conducted to understand the dynamics of the the problem for times much longer than the fundamental period of the rotor blades, when the effect of the initial conditions is not relevant and a periodic steady state has been reached.

 abstract = {This paper studies the unsteady aerodynamics of vibrating airfoils in the low reduced frequency regime with special emphasis on its impact on the scaling of the work-per-cycle curves, using an asymptotic approach. A perturbation analysis of the linearized Navier--Stokes equations for real modes at low reduced frequency is presented and some conclusions are drawn. The first important result is that the loading of the airfoil plays an essential role in the trends of the phase and modulus of the unsteady pressure caused by the vibration of the airfoil. For lightly loaded airfoils, the unsteady pressure and the influence coefficients (ICs) scale linearly with the reduced frequency whereas the phase departs from \textgreek{p}/2 and changes linearly with the reduced frequency. As a consequence, the work-per-cycle scales linearly with the reduced frequency for any interblade phase angle (IBPA), and it is independent of its sign. For highly loaded airfoils, the unsteady pressure modulus is fairly constant exhibiting only a small correction with the reduced frequency, while the phase departs from zero and varies linearly with it. In this case, only the mean value of the work-per-cycle scales linearly with the reduced frequency. This behavior is independent of the geometry of the airfoil and the mode shape in first-order approximation in the reduced frequency.

 abstract = {Brake squeal noise is still an issue since it generates high warranty costs for the automotive industry and irritation for customers. Key parameters must be known in order to reduce it. Stability analysis is a common method of studying nonlinear phenomena and has been widely used by the scientific and the engineering communities for solving disc brake squeal problems. This type of analysis provides areas of stability versus instability for driven parameters, thereby making it possible to define design criteria. Nevertheless, this technique does not permit obtaining the vibrating state of the brake system and nonlinear methods have to be employed. Temporal integration is a well-known method for computing the dynamic solution but as it is time consuming, nonlinear methods such as the Harmonic Balance Method (HBM) are preferred. This paper presents a novel nonlinear method called the Constrained Harmonic Balance Method (CHBM) that works for nonlinear systems subject to flutter instability. An additional constraint-based condition is proposed that omits the static equilibrium point (i.e. the trivial static solution of the nonlinear problem that would be obtained by applying the classical HBM) and therefore focuses on predicting both the Fourier coefficients and the fundamental frequency of the stationary nonlinear system.

The effectiveness of the proposed nonlinear approach is illustrated by an analysis of disc brake squeal. The brake system under consideration is a reduced finite element model of a pad and a disc. Both stability and nonlinear analyses are performed and the results are compared with a classical variable order solver integration algorithm.

Therefore, the objectives of the following paper are to present not only an extension of the HBM (CHBM) but also to demonstrate an application to the specific problem of disc brake squeal with extensively parametric studies that investigate the effects of the friction coefficient, piston pressure, nonlinear stiffness and structural damping.},

@article{cran1970,
 abstract = {In many applications of vibration and wave theory the magnitudes of the damping forces are small in comparison with the elastic and inertia forces. These small forces may, however, have very great influence under certain special circumstances. Damping arises from the removal of energy by radiation or dissipation. It is generally measured under conditions of cyclic or near-cyclic motion. The nature of some important damping mechanisms is discussed and an indication is given of how the damping depends on the amplitude and frequency of the cyclic motion. The idealized models of damping which are commonly employed in theoretical analyses are described and some limitations are noted. Damping is of primary importance in controlling vibration response amplitudes under conditions of steady-state resonance and stationary random excitation. Damping also plays a crucial role in fixing the borderline between stability and instability in many dynamical systems. Some examples which illustrate this are discussed, including shaft whirl, and pipeline flutter.},

@article{Cross.2020,
 abstract = {The impact of a ball with a flexible beam is analysed both experimentally and theoretically. The impact generates a bending wave that may or may not return to the impact point before the ball bounces off the beam. If the ball rebounds before the bending wave returns, then the rebound speed of the ball is determined by localised bending of the beam in the vicinity of the impact point. For a short duration impact, the rebound speed is therefore independent of whether the beam is freely supported or clamped at one or both ends, unless the impact occurs close to an end of the beam. Two different values of the coefficient of restitution can be defined, depending on whether the speed of the beam is measured when the ball rebounds or at a later stage. Experimental results were obtained using a small rubber ball impacting light wood and steel beams. A video camera and two piezoelectric disks were used to capture the relevant ball speeds and vibration response of the beam. The experiment would be suitable for undergraduate students.},

@phdthesis{csab1998a,
 abstract = {A common failure mode for turbomachinery is high-cycle fatigue of compressor

and turbine blades, due to high dynamic stresses caused by blade vibration

resonance within the operating range of the machinery. A large number of engine

shut-downs can be explained by blade failure caused by resonance vibration or

flutter. One method of reducing the dynamic stress is to increase the damping by

use of dry friction in general, and specially a device called a friction damper. It is

a well-know fact that friction dampers may reduce the vibratory blade response at

resonance. There is, however, a lack of theoretical models that can predict the

performance of an actual damper.

This thesis concerns theoretical modelling, analysis and optimization of

friction dampers. Two models have been developed, one, named the Bar model,

is a development of an existing damper model, the other, named the Brush model,

is a new design. Both models have the ability to account for microslipa in the

contact between blade and damper.

Dynamic systems with Coulomb friction, i.e. friction dampers, give rise to

nonlinear differential equations. These can be solved either through numerical

integration in the time domain or by linearizing the force-displacement

relationship of the damper. Partly new theory for linearization and a numeric

version of the Bar model have been developed. This results in forced response

analysis being computed faster and more efficiently than before.

The Bar model is relatively simple, yet complete enough to show the most

important properties of a microslip friction interface. The model was used to

optimize the weight of a new commercially used damper. Comparing simulations

with spin-pit tests with a completely bladed disk shows good qualitative

agreement, but it was not possible to see if the right weight had been predicted

because the rotor could not be excited up to the design point.

The Bar model allows only for slip motion in one direction, while the Brush

model permits relative motion between blade and damper in all six degrees of

freedom. The variables for the contact model are defined by damper geometry and

material data, except coefficient of friction and a constant for the tangential

stiffness, which have to be defined by measurements or a more advanced contact

model. This type of complicated friction damper model has not previously been

presented. Simulations and experiments have been compared for hysteresis curves

and forced vibration analysis of a simplified blade-damper-blade system. The

agreement is qualitatively good, although the results gave some questions that

need more research.},

 abstract = {A micro-slip model of a friction damper is presented in this paper. There are two formulations derived from the original force and displacement functions of the damper: a numerical blade-to-blade model and a linearized blade-to-ground model. The numerical friction damper was used in a time domain simulation of the forced response of a beam--damper system under travelling wave excitation. Frequency domain simulations with one blade and the blade-to-ground damper were also carried out. Simulation results agree well, except around the optimal damper weight, which is the weight that minimizes the response amplitude of the blade and damper system. Results from frequency domain simulations give a lighter optimal damper weight than the time domain simulations. This leads to the conclusion that if frequency domain simulations are used to find the optimum damper weight, then a slightly heavier damper weight should be chosen than suggested by frequency domain results. Comparison between a microslip and a macroslip model for the friction interface shows that the macroslip model gets close to predicting the optimal weight, but the response level is much higher than when the microslip model was used.},

The method is based on the experimental measurements of the total loss factors and the energy ratios between the subsystems of the machine structure when fully assembled. The presented approach, which will be referred to as the energy ratio method, is suitable for both conservative (no energy dissipation at the junction) and non-conservative coupling. Not only does this energy ratio method determine the coupling loss factors for directly coupled subsystems, but it also determines the coupling loss factors between subsystems which are not directly coupled. This type of coupling exists when the subsystems of the structure are small compared to the wavelength of vibration and all coupling interfaces are in the near field of each other. A series of experiments are carried out to demonstrate the use of this approach and to verify the accuracy of this method for predicting the energy distribution among a set of coupled subsystems. The determined coupling and dissipation loss factors are used in a Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA) model of a rotating machinery component and the estimated results for the response are compared to the directly measured results. As expected, the agreement between the SEA estimated results and the directly measured results is good.},

resonance above the range of possible excitations. Commonly

they are not only used to stiffen flexible structures but also to increase

damping by dry friction, reducing the amplitude of vibration.

Consequently, the resulting dynamic behavior is complex

and highly non linear. In order to improve numerical capabilities

used for the design of part span shrouds and to gain a better

understanding of the dynamic behavior of shrouded assemblies,

a jointed experimental and numerical approach has been conducted.

A first experimental test based on a cantilever beam is

considered. The beam, excited by a controlled electrodynamic

shaker, is associated to a dry friction damper at its free end. A

numerical finite element analysis and a macroslip model of contact

has been developed. The solution method in time domain

allows accurate computations of response levels and gives the

main harmonics of the steady state response. Comparison between

numerical and experimental results is very good.

A second experimental set up is constituted by an assembly

of 13 beams, cyclically mounted around a common disk and

linked by geometrically simplified shrouds. The set up allows

controlling the resultant forces in the contact and is able to exhibit

all states of contact from fully slipping to fully stuck. The

first results obtained are associated to a single couple of blades

brought into contact.},

In particular, sufficient conditions are formulated on the linearization of the control strategies along a grazing periodic trajectory, i.e. an oscillating motion that achieves zero-relative-velocity contact with a mechanical obstacle, to ensure the asymptotic stability of the grazing trajectory and, consequently, sustained dynamics in the vicinity of the grazing trajectory even under small changes in system parameters.

 abstract = {The idea of taking advantage of nonlinear system dynamics to promote adaptability or improve performance is becoming a popular concept in science and engineering. One way to explore these dynamics is to have the ability to switch between coexisting solutions at will. For example, switching between non-impacting and impacting solutions can enhance drilling processes or avoid chatter in machining. Despite the potential applications, just a few control methods with such an objective are reported in the literature. Recently, two methods were proposed: the intermittent control and the time-delayed feedback control. These methods have completely different strategies to switch between coexistent attractors, and a comparison between them can lead to a deeper understanding of both controllers and guide selecting the adequate controller for an application. This work analyses the advantages and disadvantages ofthese methods to switch between stable coexisting solutions. A piecewise linear impact oscillator model is used as a typical multistable system to test controller capabilities. The comparisons are made in a scenario where the exchange is made between impacting and non-impacting solutions where period-1 and period-2 orbits coexist. The properties of the control methods are then analysed and discussed. Results show that, on the one hand, the time-delayed feedback method requires much less knowledge of the system to be applied but cannot perform the switch in some scenarios. On the other hand, intermittent control requires more system knowledge but can succeed in all analysed scenarios.},

 abstract = {Measurements are presented from a two-beam structure with several bolted interfaces in order to characterize the nonlinear damping introduced by the joints. The measurements (all at force levels below macroslip) reveal that each underlying mode of the structure is well approximated by a single degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system with a nonlinear mechanical joint. At low enough force levels, the measurements show dissipation that scales as the second power of the applied force, agreeing with theory for a linear viscously damped system. This is attributed to linear viscous behavior of the material and/or damping provided by the support structure. At larger force levels, the damping is observed to behave nonlinearly, suggesting that damping from the mechanical joints is dominant. A model is presented that captures these effects, consisting of a spring and viscous damping element in parallel with a four-parameter Iwan model. The parameters of this model are identified for each mode of the structure and comparisons suggest that the model captures the stiffness and damping accurately over a range of forcing levels.},

@article{deC.HenshawM.J..2007,
 abstract = {Current industrial practice for the prediction and analysis of flutter relies heavily on linear methods and this has led to overly conservative design and envelope restrictions for aircraft. Although the methods have served the industry well, it is clear that for a number of reasons the inclusion of non-linearity in the mathematical and computational aeroelastic prediction tools is highly desirable. The increase in available and affordable computational resources, together with major advances in algorithms, mean that non-linear aeroelastic tools are now viable within the aircraft design and qualification environment. The Partnership for Unsteady Methods in Aerodynamics (PUMA) Defence and Aerospace Research Partnership (DARP) was sponsored in 2002 to conduct research into non-linear aeroelastic prediction methods and an academic, industry, and government consortium collaborated to address the following objectives: (1)To develop useable methodologies to model and predict non-linear aeroelastic behaviour of complete aircraft.(2)To evaluate the methodologies on real aircraft problems.(3)To investigate the effect of non-linearities on aeroelastic behaviour and to determine which have the greatest effect on the flutter qualification process.These aims have been very effectively met during the course of the programme and the research outputs include: (a)New methods available to industry for use in the flutter prediction process, together with the appropriate coaching of industry engineers.(b)Interesting results in both linear and non-linear aeroelastics, with comprehensive comparison of methods and approaches for challenging problems.(c)Additional embryonic techniques that, with further research, will further improve aeroelastics capability.This paper describes the methods that have been developed and how they are deployable within the industrial environment. We present a thorough review of the PUMA aeroelastics programme together with a comprehensive review of the relevant research in this domain. This is set within the context of a generic industrial process and the requirements of UK and US aeroelastic qualification. A range of test cases, from simple small DOF cases to full aircraft, have been used to evaluate and validate the non-linear methods developed and to make comparison with the linear methods in everyday use. These have focused mainly on aerodynamic non-linearity, although some results for structural non-linearity are also presented. The challenges associated with time domain (coupled computational fluid dynamics-computational structural model (CFD-CSM)) methods have been addressed through the development of grid movement, fluid-structure coupling, and control surface movement technologies. Conclusions regarding the accuracy and computational cost of these are presented. The computational cost of time-domain methods, despite substantial improvements in efficiency, remains high. However, significant advances have been made in reduced order methods, that allow non-linear behaviour to be modelled, but at a cost comparable with that of the regular linear methods. Of particular note is a method based on Hopf bifurcation that has reached an appropriate maturity for deployment on real aircraft configurations, though only limited results are presented herein. Results are also presented for dynamically linearised CFD approaches that hold out the possibility of non-linear results at a fraction of the cost of time coupled CFD-CSM methods. Local linearisation approaches (higher order harmonic balance and continuation method) are also presented; these have the advantage that no prior assumption of the nature of the aeroelastic instability is required, but currently these methods are limited to low DOF problems and it is thought that these will not reach a level of maturity appropriate to real aircraft problems for some years to come. Nevertheless, guidance on the most likely approaches has been derived and this forms the basis for ongoing research. It is important to recognise that the aeroelastic design and qualification requires a variety of methods applicable at different stages of the process. The methods reported herein are mapped to the process, so that their applicability and complementarity may be understood. Overall, the programme has provided a suite of methods that allow realistic consideration of non-linearity in the aeroelastic design and qualification of aircraft. Deployment of these methods is underway in the industrial environment, but full realisation of the benefit of these approaches will require appropriate engagement with the standards community so that safety standards may take proper account of the inclusion of non-linearity. {\copyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This performance indicator allows to quantify the accuracy of the predicted displacement both locally (at the blade tip) and globally. The robustness of each method with respect to variations of the external excitation is also assessed. The performances of the reduction methods are then compared in the case of frictional contact between the blade tip and the surrounding casing.

 abstract = {This article presents a methodology dedicated to the vibration analysis of turbomachine blades accounting for both geometric nonlinearities and nonlinear blade-tip/casing contacts in a numerically efficient way through the use of reduced order models. Contact is numerically handled with Lagrange multipliers and the equation of motion is integrated forward in time using an explicit central difference time integration scheme. Nonlinear internal forces caused by large displacements are evaluated using the stiffness evaluation procedure. Three reduction techniques are compared in this article, namely a nonlinear extension of the Craig--Bampton method, the proper orthogonal decomposition and a modal derivatives-based approach. These numerical methods are applied on an open industrial compressor blade model, the NASA rotor 37 blade, in order to promote reproducibility of results. The reduction methods are first applied to the blade subjected to a harmonic excitation, without contact interactions. An indicator accounting for both local and global comparison criteria is defined to more easily compare the performance of each method. When also accounting for blade-tip/casing contacts, the presented results underline that the modal derivatives-based approach is particularly well-suited for an accurate description of the blade's dynamics. This method is then employed for an in-depth analysis of the NASA rotor 37 vibration response over a wide angular speed range considering a typical contact scenario. Obtained results feature time and frequency domain signals along with stress fields. They suggest that accounting for geometric nonlinearities has a strong impact on the prediction of contact initiated interactions.},

@article{Denimal.2020,
 abstract = {The numerical prediction of the dynamic behaviour of mechanical systems subjected to friction-induced vibrations is still a tedious problem. Different methodologies exist nowadays to study it. The first one is the complex eigenvalue analysis, which is widely used by the scientists and the industrials to predict the appearance of instabilities despite its disadvantages. Other methodologies, namely temporal integration and frequential approaches, have been developed to determine the transient and/or the steady-state response to assess the history of the dynamic response, and so to identify the unstable modes involved in the nonlinear dynamic response as well as the vibration levels. However, because of their complex implementation, their high numerical cost and sometimes the strong assumptions made on the form of the solutions, these methods are not widely and currently used in industry. To cope with the limitations of the CEA, namely the over- or under-predictability and the lack of information about modal participations in the nonlinear dynamic response, developing complementary tools is necessary. Thus, this paper is devoted to the extension and generalization of a nonlinear approach, called the modal amplitude stability analysis, to the multi-instability case. The method, called the Generalized Modal Amplitude Stability Analysis (GMASA), allows to identify the evolutions and contributions of unstable modes involved in the nonlinear self-sustaining vibration response and to estimate the limit cycles. The method is applied on a phenomenological system for which it is easy to provide an understanding of the unstable mode(s) contribution to the nonlinear dynamic response of the system and for which the calculations can be performed with reasonable computational times. Thus, the efficiency and validity of the GMASA approach are investigated by comparing the GMASA results with those of the reference results based on temporal approach.},

The proposed strategy theoretically relies on the concept of nonlinear modes of the underlying conservative unforced system and the use of normal forms. Within this framework, it is shown that without internal resonance, a valid reduced order model for a nonlinear mode is a single Duffing oscillator. We then propose an efficient experimental strategy to measure the backbone curve of a particular nonlinear mode and we use it to identify the free parameters of the reduced order model. The experimental part relies on a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) and enables a robust and automatic measurement of backbone curves as well as forced responses. It is theoretically and experimentally shown that the PLL is able to stabilize the unstable part of Duffing-like frequency responses, thus enabling its robust experimental measurement. Finally, the whole procedure is tested on three experimental systems: a circular plate, a chinese gong and a piezoelectric cantilever beam. It enable to validate the procedure by comparison to available theoretical models as well as to other experimental identification methods.},

 abstract = {This paper shows some records and analysis of evidences of vortex induced vibrations of very long stay cables in the atmospheric boundary layer. The considered structure is a 254-m high telecommunication antenna whose structural system is made of a light flexible metallic truss, approx. 10$\times$10m square, which is stayed at five different levels by a set of 20 pairs of stay-cables. The exposure of this antenna is category I with a low-turbulence wind flow which results in a high sensitivity to vortex induced vibrations. The fundamental frequency of the longest cable is 0.3 Hz so that several dozens of regularly spaced natural frequencies could be observed with a sampling frequency of 500 Hz. Sufficiently long recordings allowed to distinctly observe the separate peaks corresponding to the various modes of the cables. Among them many are excited by the detachment of vortices, taking place at different frequencies (because of different cable diameters and the change of wind velocity along the height of the antenna) in the range 35-55 Hz. Referring to the so-called spectral model proposed by Vickery and Clark, the detachment of vortices takes place in a certain bandwidth, whose extent is not completely understood yet. This bandwidth is clearly observed with our long stay-cables because of the large density of mode shapes in the range [0, 200] Hz and because of their regular spacing in the spectral domain. To the author's knowledge this constitutes a first attempt at identifying this parameter of the Vickery and Clark model from full-scale measurements.},

 abstract = {This dissertation presents a new, wave based prediction technique for the

steady-state dynamic analysis of coupled vibro-acoustic systems. The

technique is based on a Trefftz approach, in which the field variables are

expanded in terms of structural and acoustic wave functions, which are

homogeneous solutions of the governing dynamic equations, along with

some particular solution functions. In this way, the dynamic equations are

exactly satisfied, irrespective of the contributions of the wave functions to

the field variable expansions. These contributions result from a weighted

residual or a least-squares formulation of the boundary conditions.

It follows from the application of this methodology for various types of

coupled vibro-acoustic problems that accurate predictions can be obtained

with wave models, which are not only significantly smaller, but also

computationally less demanding than corresponding element based models.

Due to this enhanced computational efficiency, the practical frequency

limitation of the proposed technique is substantially higher than for the

existing techniques. In this way, the wave based prediction technique

enables accurate predictions in the mid-frequency range, for which the

computational efforts, involved with element based models, become

prohibitively large.},

The harmonic balance (HB) method is widely used in the literature for analyzing the periodic solutions of nonlinear mechanical systems. The objective of this paper is to exploit the method for bifurcation analysis, i.e.,~for the detection and tracking of bifurcations of nonlinear systems. To this end, an algorithm that combines the computation of the Floquet exponents with bordering techniques is developed. A new procedure for the tracking of Neimark--Sacker bifurcations that exploits the properties of eigenvalue derivatives is also proposed. The HB method is demonstrated using numerical experiments of a spacecraft structure that possesses a nonlinear vibration isolation device.},

 abstract = {The increased usage of adhesive bonding as a joining method in modern aerospace components has led to developing reliable ultrasonic health monitoring systems for detection of regions of poor adhesion. Nonlinear acousto-ultrasonic techniques based on higher harmonics and subharmonic frequencies have shown to be sensitive to the detection of micro-voids and disbonds. Nonlinear resonance properties of disbonds generate various nonlinear phenomena such as self-modulation, subharmonics, hysteresis and so on. By exploiting the local natures of these phenomena, this paper demonstrates the use of subharmonics for detection and imaging of flaws in bonded structures. To optimise the experimental testing a two-dimensional analytical model and a three-dimensional finite element analysis simulation were developed for understanding the generation of nonlinear elastic effects with emphasis on subharmonic frequency components. The proposed analytical model qualitatively described the generation of subharmonics but also higher harmonics due to the nonlinear intermodulation of the driving and resonance frequencies associated with the disbonded region. The numerical model was developed by modifying the user defined cohesive element formulation with a bi-linear traction-displacement relationship in order to simulate the interaction of elastic waves with the structural disbond. Whilst the analytical model supported the selection of the driving frequency, the numerical one successfully predicted the generation of subharmonic frequencies originating in the disbonded area. Experimental tests were conducted on a disbonded single lap joint structure using surface-bonded piezoelectric transducers and a laser-Doppler vibrometer, and allowed to validate the analytical and numerical results. It was clearly demonstrated that the nonlinear resonance effects in the form of subharmonics could be used to discriminate reliably regions of poor adhesion in bonded structures. This work can lead to new in situ nonlinear acoustic based health monitoring system for locating and imaging defects in critical aerospace components.},

 abstract = {Experimental investigations on a single stage centrifugal compressor showed that measured blade vibration amplitudes vary considerably along a constant speed line from choke to surge. The unsteady flow has been analyzed to obtain detailed insight into the excitation mechanism. Therefore, a turbocharger compressor stage impeller has been modeled and simulated by means of computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Two operating points at off-design conditions were analyzed. One was close to choke and the second one close to the surge line. Transient CFD was employed, since only then a meaningful prediction of the blade excitation, caused by the unsteady flow situation, can be expected. Actually, it was observed that close to surge a steady state solution could not be obtained; only transient CFD could deliver a converged solution. The CFD results show the effect of the interaction between the inducer casing bleed system and the main flow. Additionally, the effect of the nonaxisymmetric components, such as the suction elbow and the discharge volute, was analyzed. The volute geometry itself had not been modeled. It turned out to be sufficient to impose a circumferentially asymmetric pressure distribution at the exit of the vaned diffuser to simulate the volute. Volute and suction elbow impose a circumferentially asymmetric flow field, which induces blade excitation. To understand the excitation mechanism, which causes the measured vibration behavior of the impeller, the time dependent pressure distribution on the impeller blades was transformed into the frequency domain by Fourier decomposition. The complex modal pressure data were imposed on the structure that was modeled by finite element methods (FEM). Following state-of-the-art calculations to analyze the free vibration behavior of the impeller, forced response calculations were carried out. Comparisons with the experimental results demonstrate that this employed methodology is capable of predicting the impeller's vibration behavior under real engine conditions. Integrating the procedure into the design of centrifugal compressors will enhance the quality of the design process.},

 abstract = {Bladed discs are very sensitive structures and the amplitude vibration of each

blade can vary significantly from blade to blade due to a series of factors such as

geometrical inhomogeneity between blades or material properties. These factors

lead to bladed disks mistuned thus the forced response amplitudes can be much

higher than the level predicted for a tuned assembly.



Designed models need to be ``validate'' to predict the response of a real bladed

disc within the tolerances set by the manufactures and this process is very

expensive as well as difficult. The validation process needs ``reference data'' as

fundamental input against what all predictions can be compared and validated.

Data that can be provided both under stationary conditions and under rotating

conditions and the latter is the most difficult to achieve, especially for bladed

disc assemblies which are very sensitive to any structural modification as it

could be attaching a transducer to measure vibrations. There are contact-less

measurement techniques available which, however, provide limited information

because they can measure only limited areas of the vibrating structures.



The aim of this study is to design measurement methods, using a standard

Scanning Laser Doppler Vibrometer (SLDV) and to integrate it into a software

platform which will be able to handle a series of measurement tasks both under

stationary and rotating conditions. The main contribution of this thesis is to

extend the use of Continuous Scanning LDV (CSLDV) to the rotating structures,

such as bladed discs, thus to perform synchronous measurements. Hence, a

bladed disc is needed to be designed to perform vibration predictions and

measurements and a mathematical model of the measurement test to control,

critically, all possible sources of errors involved in measurement under rotating

conditions; all these to produce a robust measurement method. While the

primary focus is the measurement method, the study also extends to evaluation

of the sensitivity properties of the bladed disk test pieces that are the object of

the measurement tool.},

This paper presents a detailed description of several harmonic balance methods and a continuation framework allowing the methods to follow the response of dynamic systems from the bifurcation point to any desired parameter value, while successfully negotiating further fold bifurcations. The continuation framework is described for systems undergoing subcritical and supercritical Hopf bifurcations as well as a particular type of explosive bifurcation.

It is shown that high-order harmonic balance solutions will accurately capture the complete bifurcation behavior of this system for both types of nonlinearity. Low-order solutions can become inaccurate in the presence of numerous folds in the limit-cycle oscillation branch but can still yield practical engineering information at a fraction of the cost of higher-order solutions.

 abstract = {Abstract

Aeromechanical design of wind turbines requires a high-fidelity analysis toolbox that can cover a wide spectrum of flow speeds from incompressible to compressible flow regimes. As it is known, the convergence of the compressible density-based flow solvers is deteriorated when the flow lies in an essentially incompressible regime due to the disparity between the eigenvalues of the flux Jacobian matrices. This problem is usually resolved using a low-speed preconditioner that can balance the eigenvalues, thus alleviating the convergence issues in the density-based flow solver. In this paper, a low-speed preconditioner that fully couples the Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes equations with the one equation Spalart--Allmaras turbulence model is developed for steady as well as unsteady flows. The preconditioner incorporates the working variable of the turbulence model into the formulation, thus resulting in balanced artificial dissipation terms and modified local time-steps to ensure convergence acceleration for the compressible flow solver. The preconditioner is first applied to a set of two-dimensional steady flow cases to assess the convergence acceleration. This new preconditioner is further enhanced with an unsteady limiter that improves the convergence of the harmonic balance solver used for the simulation of unsteady periodic flows such as those that arise in wind turbine applications. Although the CPU time per iteration is increased by about 9{\%}--11{\%}, the present preconditioner is capable of reducing the number of required iterations by about 50{\%}--60{\%} in order to achieve the same level of accuracy as with the non-preconditioned solver.},

 abstract = {In this two-part paper the phenomenon of part span rotating stall is studied. The objective is to improve understanding of the physics by which stable and persistent rotating stall occurs within high speed axial flow compressors. This phenomenon is studied both experimentally (Part I) and numerically (Part II). The experimental observations reported in Part I are now explored through the use of 3D unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier- Stokes (RANS) simulation. The objective is to both validate the computational model and, where possible, explore some physical aspects of the phenomena. Unsteady simulations are presented, performed at a fixed speed with the three rows of variable stator vanes adjusted to deliberately mismatch the front stages and provoke stall. Two families of rotating stall are identified by the model, consistent with experimental observations from Part I. The first family of rotating stall originates from hub corner separations developing on the stage 1 stator vanes. These gradually coalesce into a multicell rotating stall pattern confined to the hub region of the stator and its downstream rotor. The second family originates from regions of blockage associated with tip clearance flow over the stage 1 rotor blade. These also coalesce into a multicell rotating stall pattern of shorter length scale confined to the leading edge tip region. Some features of each of these two patterns are then explored as the variable stator vanes (VSVs) are mismatched further, pushing each region deeper into stall. The numerical predictions show a credible match with the experimental findings of Part I. This suggests that a RANS modeling approach is sufficient to capture some important aspects of part span rotating stall behavior. {\copyright} 2015 by ASME.},

The objective is to improve understanding of the physics by which stable and persistent rotating stall occurs within high speed axial flow compressors. This phenomenon is studied both experimentally (Part I) and through the use of unsteady RANS simulations (Part II). In this paper, the behavior of an eight stage high speed compressor is studied during slow acceleration maneuvres along a fixed working line. Casing mounted pressure transducers and rotor mounted strain gages are used to examine the spectral content of any unsteadiness in the flow and its behavior across the operating range. By deliberate aerodynamic mismatching of the front stages through adjustment of three rows of variable stator vanes (VSVs), stable rotating stall is initiated. The observed behavior falls into two {\textquotedbl}families{\textquotedbl} of high and low frequency when tracked on the instrumentation. Further analysis based on the Doppler shift between the static and rotating measurements confirms that these respective phenomena are due to rotating stall of high and low cell count. Acoustic modes resulting from stall/rotor interaction are also identified. Strong correlation of the stall intensity with simple 1D meanline predicted loading parameters suggests that these families of behavior are independently linked to the stalling of different regions within the compressor. {\copyright} 2015 by ASME.},

Research in vibration-based damage identification has been rapidly expanding over the last few years. The basic idea behind this technology is that modal parameters (notably frequencies, mode shapes, and modal damping) are functions of the physical properties of the structure (mass, damping, and stiffness). Therefore, changes in the physical properties will cause detectable changes in the modal properties. The motivation for the development of this technology is presented. The methods are categorized according to various criteria such as the level of damage detection provided, model-based versus non-model-based methods, and linear versus nonlinear methods. The methods are also described in general terms including difficulties associated with their implementation and their fidelity. Past, current, and future-planned applications of this technology to actual engineering systems are summarized. The paper concludes with a discussion of critical issues for future research in the area of vibration-based damage identification.},

 abstract = {The vibrating characteristics of simple mechanical systems, damped by real dry friction or its combination with viscous damping are investigated. Under the simple system we understand a system the vibrating characteristics of which can be simulated in some defined frequency range using a modal model with two degrees of freedom. It is assumed that the normal load acting on the friction contact area does not change during the vibration. Such assumption is fullfilled for single-mode-vibrations of a blade with a flexible blade-to-ground friction damper, or of two bladed turbine packet. The expression {\textquotedbl}real dry friction{\textquotedbl} is introduced here to indicate the deviation from the Coulomb's simplification and from functional dependence of dry friction force on friction velocity only, that is usually considered as a basic source of relaxation self-excited oscillations.~It must be pointed out that those simplifying assumptions are not in agreement with experimental observations. The main feature of thze improved model is that it considers the dependence of the dry-friction-force on time during the stick-slip period of interval occuring within the forced or self-excited oscillation, and its decreace in the subsequent slip state. The solution of the problem is based on the method of Krylov and Bogoliubov. The all necessary parameters of the solved system are defined by the hysteresis loop of general shape, including the relationship both of displacement and velocity of motion and some other relevant parameters. The new model enables the numerical simulation of the considered system of steady state response in the stable regions, and of nonsteady-state response in the instable regions with respect to the memory of the previous state and to the initial shear pre-stress in the contact area.},

@phdthesis{dond2008,
 abstract = {This dissertation deals with Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) simulation

methods to predict the vibro-acoustic behavior of vehicles, more speci``cally

in automotive industry. The Finite Element Method (FEM) is often used for

numerical design validations in the low-frequency range. For accurate pre-

dictions up to higher frequencies, the element mesh must be further re``ned,

which requires a prohibitively large computational eﬀort. Moreover, the ef-

fect of uncertainty and variability on the vehicle behavior increases with the

frequency. To predict these eﬀects, typically a high number of variants of the

nominal vehicle must be analyzed. Finally, there is an industrial need to have

simulation results already in the early concept phase, before the availability of

the initial Computer-Aided Design (CAD) model. Conventional FEM models

can only be created on the basis of this initial model.

The above challenges are the framework of the research in this dissertation.

Among others, the effect of uncertainty on the frequency response characteristics

of structures has been investigated, which led to a novel ``Short Transformation

Method'' (STM) for efficient response predictions for the class of

structures with a monotonic influence of parameter uncertainty. In addition,

the robustness of the dynamic system behavior to spot weld failure has been

investigated. The strive for more efficient design variant analysis led to a

novel ``Wave-Based Substructuring'' (WBS) technique. A smaller wave-based

description of the coupling interface enables a more efficient reduction of substructures

using modal superposition. The smaller-sized system model can

then serve as a basis for local design variant analysis. Regarding CAE in an

early design stage, a Reduced Beam and Joint Modeling approach has been

applied to efficiently analyze and modify the beam-like structures and joints

in a vehicle body. The added value of the contributions in this dissertation

in a vehicle engineering design practice has been demonstrated by means of

applications to realistic models taken from automotive industry.},

@article{Donders.2010,
 abstract = {In the vehicle design process, design decisions are more and more based on virtual prototypes. Due to competitive and regulatory pressure, vehicle manufacturers are forced to improve product quality, to reduce time-to-market and to launch an increasing number of design variants on the global market. To speed up the design iteration process, substructuring and component mode synthesis (CMS) methods are commonly used, involving the analysis of substructure models and the synthesis of the substructure analysis results. Substructuring and CMS enable efficient decentralized collaboration across departments and allow to benefit from the availability of parallel computing environments. However, traditional CMS methods become prohibitively inefficient when substructures are coupled along large interfaces, i.e. with a large number of degrees of freedom (DOFs) at the interface between substructures. The reason is that the analysis of substructures involves the calculation of a number of enrichment vectors, one for each interface degree of freedom (DOF). Since large interfaces are common in vehicles (e.g. the continuous line connections to connect the body with the windshield, roof or floor), this interface bottleneck poses a clear limitation in the vehicle noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) design process. Therefore there is a need to describe the interface dynamics more efficiently. This paper presents a wave-based substructuring (WBS) approach, which allows reducing the interface representation between substructures in an assembly by expressing the interface DOFs in terms of a limited set of basis functions (``waves''). As the number of basis functions can be much lower than the number of interface DOFs, this greatly facilitates the substructure analysis procedure and results in faster design predictions. The waves are calculated once from a full nominal assembly analysis, but these nominal waves can be re-used for the assembly of modified components. The WBS approach thus enables efficient structural modification predictions of the global modes, so that efficient vibro-acoustic design modification, optimization and robust design become possible. The results show that wave-based substructuring offers a clear benefit for vehicle design modifications, by improving both the speed of component reduction processes and the efficiency and accuracy of design iteration predictions, as compared to conventional substructuring approaches.},

 abstract = {The loading--unloading behavior of local contact between elastic body and elastic-ideally plastic body is studied analytically and numerically. An analytical model is derived based on the simulating results pertinent to Brinell indentation and elastic--plastic beam impact. The observed linear and nonlinear contact characters from simulations are introduced into the proposed analytical model. The contact law is expressed in much easier formulations by four normalized contact variables, normalized average contact pressure H¯, relative strain \textgreek{L}, normalized contact area c2 and relative contact force \textgreek{Y}. The elastic loading is following Hertz contact theory. The linear contact laws for the elastic--plastic and fully plastic loadings and the nonlinear contact laws for the finite deformation loading are introduced in term of the finite element (FE) contact simulations pertinent to Brinell indentation. The coefficients in the contact law are determined by fitting the FE contact simulations and by satisfying the continuous conditions. The more suitable regime of Hertz solution and a refined force--indentation relation of unloading are introduced as well into the analytical model according to the FE impact simulations. The model is finally verified with the FE simulation and experiment of elastic-ideally beam struck by elastic sphere. The analytical model shows a very good agreement between the FE-simulations and the experimental data for either low or moderate velocity impacts, while Stronge model is dependent upon impact velocity. The loading and unloading laws are highly accurate, even for the finite contact deformation in which the nearly 90{\%} of cross section has yielded and the contact radius a (normalized by the indenter radius R) is up to a/R = 0.217.},

Most of the plastic deformation is confined to the impact zone but some partial additional plastic hinges are observed to develop. The plastic strain magnitude and distribution near the impact zone are similar for all tested impact locations, but higher for the more symmetrical impacts. The conversion of impact energy into kinetic, elastic strain energy and plastic dissipation work is characterized for various impact locations along the beam. It is observed that symmetrical impact results in higher plastic dissipation and lower kinetic energy as opposed to unsymmetrical impact.

In this context, piecewise polynomials, or splines, offer a simple and flexible representation basis requiring limited prior knowledge. The generally-adopted discretization for splines consists in an even distribution of their control points, termed knots. While this may prove successful for simple nonlinearities, a more advanced strategy is needed for nonlinear restoring forces with strong local variations. The present paper specifically introduces a two-step methodology to select automatically the location of the knots. It proposes to derive an initial model, using nonlinear subspace identification, and incorporating cubic spline basis functions with fixed and equally-spaced abscissas. In a second step, the location of the knots is optimized iteratively by minimizing a least-squares cost function. A single-degree-of-freedom system with a discontinuous stiffness characteristic is considered as a case study. {\copyright} The Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc. 2017.},

 abstract = {During the design cycle of aircraft, the role played by the structural dynamicists consists in constructing a validated numerical model of the aircraft behavior under vibration. Model validation is performed experimentally, by correlating predicted and measured natural frequencies and mode shapes. This process has become standard in the aircraft industry; however, it relies throughout on the assumption of linearity of the structural vibrations, while it must be acknowledged that, today, test engineers are more and more often confronted with nonlinearities during ground vibration measurement campaigns. Nonlinear behavior may result from various physical mechanisms, the most notable being dynamic boundary conditions, such as clearances and impacts. In this paper, a consistent set of techniques is described to locate, characterize and model nonlinearities using typical aircraft vibration data, with the purpose of upgrading the initial linear finite-element (FE) model into a reliable nonlinear one. A constant thread in this set is the analysis of sensor measurements in the phase space. It is first shown that simple approximations in the structural equations of motion can lead to easy-to-interpret visualization plots for nonlinearity location and characterization. The analysis is then rendered quantitative by describing an effective metric for nonlinear FE model updating. The presented tools are illustrated using sine-sweep data measured at multiple forcing amplitudes on a full-scale F-16 aircraft. Nonlinear stiffness and damping elements, modeling a loosened attachment at the aircraft wing tip, are identified and introduced in a linear FE model, leading to accurate response predictions in a strongly nonlinear regime of motion.},

 abstract = {In this paper the dynamic behaviour of a cantilever beam with a breathing crack is investigated both theoretically and experimentally. The primary aim is to reveal the nonlinear behaviour of the system by using time frequency methods as an alternative to Fourier analysis methodology. A simple single-degree-of freedom lumped system is employed to simulate the dynamic behaviour of the beam. The time varying stiffness is modelled using a simple periodic function. Both simulated and experimental response data are analysed by applying empirical mode decomposition and Hilbert transform and the instantaneous frequency (IF) is obtained. It is shown that the IF oscillates between the frequencies corresponding to open and closed states revealing the physical process of crack breathing. The variation of the IF follows definite trends and therefore can be used as an indicator of the crack size. It allows an efficient and accurate description of the nonlinearities caused by the presence of a breathing crack. Consequently, it can be used to improve vibration based crack detection techniques.},

 abstract = {The interaction of a flexible structure with a flowing fluid in which it is submersed or by which it is surrounded gives rise to a rich variety of physical phenomena with applications in many fields of engineering, for example, the stability and response of aircraft wings, the flow of blood through arteries, the response of bridges and tall buildings to winds, the vibration of turbine and compressor blades, and the oscillation of heat exchangers. To understand these phenomena we need to model both the structure and the fluid. However, in keeping with the overall theme of this volume, the emphasis here is on the fluid models. Also, the applications are largely drawn from aerospace engineering although the methods and fundamental physical phenomena have much wider applications. In the present article, we emphasize recent developments and future challenges. To provide a context for these, the article begins with a description of the various physical models for a fluid undergoing time-dependent motion, then moves to a discussion of the distinction between linear and nonlinear models, time-linearized models and their solution in either the time or frequency domains, and various methods for treating nonlinear models, including time marching, harmonic balance, and systems identification. We conclude with an extended treatment of the modal character of time-dependent flows and the construction of reduced-order models based on an expansion in terms of fluid modes. The emphasis is on the enhanced physical understanding and dramatic reductions in computational cost made possible by reduced-order models, time linearization, and methodologies drawn from dynamical system theory.

 abstract = {The state of reduced order modeling of unsteady aerodynamic flows for the efficient calculation of fluid-structure interaction (aeroelasticity) is discussed. Reduced order modeling is a set of conceptually novel and computationally efficient techniques for computing unsteady flow about airfoils, wings, and turbomachinery cascades. Starting with either a time domain or frequency domain computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of unsteady aerodynamic flows, a large, sparse eigenvalue problem is solved. Then, using just a few of the resulting aerodynamic eigenmodes, a Reduced Order Model (ROM) of the unsteady flow is constructed. The aerodynamic ROM can then be combined with a similar ROM for the structure to provide a Reduced Order Aeroelastic Model that reduces computational model sized and cost by several orders of magnitude. Moreover, the aerodynamic and aeroelastic eigenvalue and eigenmode information provides important insights into the physics of unsteady flows and fluid-structure interaction. The method is particularly well suited for use in the active control of aeroelastic (fluid-structural) and unsteady aerodynamic phenomena as well as in standard aeroelastic analysis. As an alternative to the use of aerodynamic eigenmodes, Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) has also been explored. POD is an attractive alternative because of the greater simplicity of calculating POD modes rather than fluid eigenmodes per se. Moreover once the POD modes have been used to construct a Reduced Order Model, this ROM may be used to find a good approximation to the dominant aerodynamic eigenmodes. After the Hopf Bifurcation (flutter) condition is determined for the fluid-structural system, a novel High Dimensional Harmonic Balance (HDHB) solution method for the fluid (and structural) model(s) proves to be a very efficient technique for determining limit cycle oscillations in fluid-structural systems. In this approach one exploits the knowledge of the aeroelastic eigenmode determined from the aeroelastic ROM. Several examples will be discussed including the limit cycle oscillations (LCO) of the F-16 aircraft and the limit cycle oscillations (LCO) of the Von Karman vortex street behind a cylinder in a cross-flow. The latter is a prototypical example of self-excited fluid oscillations that occur for bluff bodies including wings at high angles of attack. Correlation of theoretical calculations with experiment will also be shown.},

 abstract = {In this paper, a novel modeling methodology for the nonlinear vibration analysis of multistage bladed-disk systems with small blade-to-blade mistuning and a cracked blade is proposed. The modeling strategy is based on an efficient stagewise reduced-order modeling method based on cyclic symmetry analysis and component mode synthesis. Reduced-order models are constructed for individual stages and assembled by projecting the motion of the interface of the neighboring stages onto a set of harmonic shape functions. The analysis procedure allows the stages to have different numbers of blades and mismatched computational grids on the interfaces of the neighboring stages. Furthermore, the modeling framework is independent of the modeling method for each stage, which enables the use of various existing modeling methods of single stages. Moreover, nonlinearity can also be included in the multistage computations, as long as the nonlinearity can be modeled for a single stage. To demonstrate the capability of the modeling procedure, the nonlinear effect of crack opening and closing is considered, in conjunction with the effects of small mistuning. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methods are discussed. {\copyright} 2011 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {New work on the dynamics of preload nonlinearity in a single degree of freedom mechanical system is described in this article. Significant computational issues that are encountered in the application of direct harmonic balance method are avoided by flipping over the force-displacement nonlinear relationship. An indirect multi-term harmonic balance method is then proposed. Unlike the traditional direct harmonic balance method, our effort is targeted toward the determination of periodic solutions of nonlinear force instead of displacement. The indirect method also allows us to evaluate the stability of periodic solutions by employing the Hill's scheme. The primary harmonic responses as exhibited by the preload nonlinearity are validated by the describing function method. Results show that, in general, the nonlinear responses depend on the value of mean load and they differ considerably from those based on linear system analysis. Primary resonance typically shows the hardening spring effect. Unstable solutions are observed in the vicinity of primary resonance as the oscillator makes a transition from a linear to a nonlinear system. Super-harmonic resonances are found under the light mean load conditions. A new instability, in the form of quasi-periodic or chaotic responses at or near the anti-resonances, is also found in our work. Finally, we successfully compare our analysis with one specific experiment that is reported in the literature.},

The basic assumption is that, each time a runner blade passes a guide vane, a radial, a tangential and an axial load are produced. With the help of three simple mathematical models the forces and moments and especially their frequencies resulting from all these loads are determined. Depending on the position in time and space of each impulse and on the considered resultant, namely that acting on the shaft, on a blade or on the disk, these resultants have other properties. Furthermore, in the case of vibrations of shafts and disks, in addition to the known resonance condition, i.e. excitation frequency = natural frequency, an existence condition depending on the number of blades has to be taken into account.},

This behaviour is typical of a wave turbulence regime, in which the wide-band spectrum of excited modes is observable in the form of an energy cascade. The modal method is selected for its versatility in handling complex damping laws that can be implemented easily by selecting appropriate damping values in each one of the modal equations. In the first part of the paper, the modal method is explained in its generality, and it will be seen that the method is valid for plates with arbitrary geometry and boundary conditions as long as the eigenmodes are known. Secondly, a time-integration, energy-conserving scheme for perfect and imperfect plates is presented, and implementation comments are given in order to treat efficiently the high-dimensionality of the resulting dynamical system. The scheme is run with appropriate parameters in order to produce sound samples. A simple impact law is considered for the excitation, whereas the flexibility of the method is highlighted by showing simulations for free-edge circular plates and simply-supported rectangular plates, together with various damping laws.},

 abstract = {This article presents the complete study of the long-time evolution of random waves of a vibrating thin elastic plate in the limit of small plate deformation so that modes of oscillations interact weakly. According to the wave turbulence theory a nonlinear wave system evolves in longtime creating a slow redistribution of the spectral energy from one mode to another. We derive step by step, following the method of cumulants expansion and multiscale asymptotic perturbations, the kinetic equation for the second order cumulants as well as the second and fourth order renormalization of the dispersion relation of the waves. We characterize the non-equilibrium evolution to an equilibrium wave spectrum, which happens to be the well known Rayleigh--Jeans distribution. Moreover we show the existence of an energy cascade, often called the Kolmogorov--Zakharov spectrum, which happens to be not simply a power law, but a logarithmic correction to the Rayleigh--Jeans distribution. We perform numerical simulations confirming these scenarii, namely the equilibrium relaxation for closed systems and the existence of an energy cascade wave spectrum. Both show a good agreement between theoretical predictions and numerics. We show also some other relevant features of vibrating elastic plates, such as the existence of a self-similar wave action inverse cascade which happens to blow-up in finite time. We discuss the mechanism of the wave breakdown phenomena in elastic plates as well as the limit of strong turbulence which arises as the thickness of the plate vanishes. Finally, we discuss the role of dissipation and the connection with experiments, and the generalization of the wave turbulence theory to elastic shells. {\copyright} 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

We show that the energy cascade is dominated by the kinetic contribution and that the stretching energy is at thermodynamical equilibrium.

A linearized method of analysis is developed giving analytical expressions for the general response of the system for both slip and no-slip conditions at the damper interface. The theory is compared with the linearized formulation given by Den Hartog [1956 Mechanical Vibrations, McGraw-Hill] and with experimental measurement. It is shown that the inclusion of a linear dependence on the relative slip amplitude in the expression for the frictional force during slipping produces a significant improvement in the response prediction capability of the theory over Den Hartog's method.

 abstract = {This paper describes the design, modeling, and analysis of a novel magnetic spring--damper. This cost-effective, self-powered magnetic spring--damper utilizes two permanent magnets and a conductive aluminum plate to generate both spring and variable damping effects. Eddy currents are generated in the aluminum plate due to its relative motion with respect to the magnets. These eddy currents produce a repulsive force that is proportional to the velocity of the conductor such that the moving magnet and conductor act as a viscous damper. The structure of the proposed passive magnetic spring--damper is simple, and does not require an external power supply or any other electronic device. An accurate, analytical model of the system is obtained by using the electromagnetic theory to estimate the electromagnetic forces, induced in the system. The newly developed model can be used to design high-performance dampers for various applications. To optimize the design, simulations are conducted and the design parameters are evaluated. After a magnetic spring--damper prototype is fabricated, experiments are conducted to verify the accuracy of the theoretical model. The eddy current model exhibits a 7.5{\%} RMS error for the damping ratio estimation, and a damping ratio as high as 40 N s/m is achieved by the fabricated prototype.},

 abstract = {Damping mechanisms are a crucial factor for influencing the vibration behavior of dynamic systems. In many applications vibrations are undesirable and need to be reduced by appropriate measures. For instance, vibrations in vehicles can reduce driving comfort or in civil engineering resonance damage can occur in constructions. An interesting and cost-effective way of increasing damping is particle damping. In modern processes of additive manufacturing, like laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), unmelted powder can be left inside a structure on purpose after making and thus producing integrated particle dampers already. Additively manufactured particle damping has not yet reached the industrial level because there are no detailed specifications for the design process. This includes the modeling of (non-linear) dynamic properties, based on numerous design parameters. The state of the art reveals that the effect of particle damping has been convincingly demonstrated, but transferability of the obtained information is still limited. In this paper the effect of particle damping is investigated experimentally with LPBF manufactured beam structures made of AlSi10Mg. Particle damping is evaluated in terms of performance curves for different beam parameter sets. The aim is to help the designer, who needs to keep amplitudes in certain range to estimate the damping of the potential particle damper via the given performance curves. Damping is determined via experimental modal analysis by impulse excitation. The response is evaluated in the frequency domain using the Circle-Fit method with a focus on the beams first bending mode of vibration. Beyond that, a significantly increased damping could be verified up to the seventh bending mode covering a frequency range between 600~Hz and 18k~Hz. Damping through particle-filled cavities shows up to 20 times higher damping compared to the same component with fused powder.},

 abstract = {Nonlinear Normal Modes (NNMs) offer tremendous insight into the dynamic behavior of a nonlinear system, extending many concepts that are familiar in linear modal analysis. Hence there is interest in developing methods to experimentally and numerically determine a system's NNMs for model updating or simply to characterize its dynamic response. Previous experimental work has shown that a mono-harmonic excitation can be used to isolate a system's dynamic response in the neighborhood of a NNM along the main backbones of a system. This work shows that a multi-harmonic excitation is needed to isolate a NNM when well separated linear modes of a structure couple to produce an internal resonance. It is shown that one can tune the multiple harmonics of the input excitation using a plot of the input force versus the response velocity until the area enclosed by the force-velocity curve is minimized. Once an appropriated NNM is measured, one can increase the force level and retune the frequency to obtain a NNM at a higher amplitude or remove the excitation and measure the structure's decay down a NNM backbone. This work explores both methods using simulations and measurements of a nominally-flat clamped-clamped beam excited at a single point with a magnetic force. Numerical simulations are used to validate the method in a well defined environment and to provide comparison with the experimentally measured NNMs. The experimental results seem to produce a good estimate of two NNMs along their backbone and part of an internal resonance branch. Full-field measurements are then used to further explore the couplings between the underlying linear modes along the identified NNMs. {\copyright} 2016.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a case study in which the finite element model for a curved circular plate is calibrated to reproduce both the linear and nonlinear dynamic response measured from two nominally identical samples. The linear dynamic response is described with the linear natural frequencies and mode shapes identified with a roving hammer test. Due to the uncertainty in the stiffness characteristics from the manufactured perforations, the linear natural frequencies are used to update the effective modulus of elasticity of the full order finite element model (FEM). The nonlinear dynamic response is described with nonlinear normal modes (NNMs) measured using force appropriation and high speed 3D digital image correlation (3D-DIC). The measured NNMs are used to update the boundary conditions of the full order FEM through comparison with NNMs calculated from a nonlinear reduced order model (NLROM). This comparison revealed that the nonlinear behavior could not be captured without accounting for the small curvature of the plate from manufacturing as confirmed in literature. So, 3D-DIC was also used to identify the initial static curvature of each plate and the resulting curvature was included in the full order FEM. The updated models are then used to understand how the stress distribution changes at large response amplitudes providing a possible explanation of failures observed during testing. {\copyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

 abstract = {Spatially detailed dynamic measurements of thin, lightweight structures can be difficult to obtain due to the structure׳s low mass and complicated deformations under certain loading conditions. If traditional contacting sensors, such as accelerometers, strain gauges, displacement transducers, etc., are used, the total number of measurement locations available is limited by the weight added and the effect each sensor has on the local stiffness of the contact area. Other non-contacting sensors, such as Laser Doppler Vibrometers (LDV), laser triangulation sensors, proximity sensors, etc., do not affect the dynamics of a structure, but are limited to single point measurements. In contrast, a few recently developed non-contacting measurement techniques have been shown to be capable of simultaneously measuring the response over a wide measurement field. Two techniques are considered here: Continuous-Scan Laser Doppler Vibrometry (CSLDV) and high speed Three-Dimensional Digital Image Correlation (3D DIC). With the use of these techniques, unprecedented measurement resolution can be achieved. In this work, the linear and nonlinear deformations of a clamped, nominally flat beam and plate under steady state sinusoidal loading will be measured using both techniques. In order to assess their relative merits, the linear natural frequencies, mode shapes, and nonlinear deformation shapes measured with each method are compared. Both measurement systems give comparable results in many cases, although 3D DIC is more accurate for spatially complex deformations at large amplitudes and CSLDV is more accurate at low amplitudes and when the spatial deformation pattern is simpler.},

 abstract = {Understanding the linear and nonlinear dynamic behaviour of beams is critical for the design of many engineering structures such as spacecraft antennae, aircraft wings, and turbine blades. When the eigenvalues of such structures are closely-spaced, nonlinearity may lead to interactions between the underlying linear normal modes (LNMs). This work considers a clamped-clamped beam which exhibits nonlinear behaviour due to axial tension from large amplitudes of deformation. An additional cross-beam, mounted transversely and with a movable mass at each tip, allows tuning of the primary torsion LNM such that it is close to the primary bending LNM. Perturbing the location of one mass relative to that of the other leads to veering between the eigenvalues of the bending and torsion LNMs. For a number of selected geometries in the region of veering, a nonlinear reduced order model (NLROM) is created and the nonlinear normal modes (NNMs) are used to describe the underlying nonlinear behaviour of the structure. The relationship between the `closeness' of the eigenvalues and the nonlinear dynamic behaviour is demonstrated in the NNM backbone curves, and veering-like behaviour is observed. Finally, the forced and damped dynamics of the structure are predicted using several analytical and numerical tools and are compared to experimental measurements. As well as showing a good agreement between the predicted and measured responses, phenomena such as a 1:1 internal resonance and quasi-periodic behaviour are identified.},

 abstract = {A harmonic balance technique for the analysis of two-dimensional linear (small-disturbance) and nonlinear unsteady flows in multistage turbomachines is presented. The present method uses a mixed time-domain/frequency-domain approach that allows one to compute the unsteady aerodynamic response of multistage machines to both blade vibration (the flutter problem) and wake interaction (the forced response problem). In general, the flowfield may have multiple excitation frequencies that are not integer multiples of each other, so that the unsteady flow is (sometimes) aperiodic in time. Using our approach, we model each blade row using a computational grid spanning a single blade passage. In each blade row, we store several sublime level solutions. For flows that are periodic in tune, these subtime levels span a single time period. For aperiodic flows, the temporal period spanned by these subtime level solutions is sufficiently long to sample the relevant discrete frequencies contained in the aperiodic flow. In both cases, these subtime level solutions are related to each other through the time-derivative terms in the Euler or Navier-Stokes equations and boundary conditions; complex periodicity conditions connect the subtime levels within a blade passage, and interrow boundary conditions connect the solutions among blade rows. The resulting discretized equations, which are mathematically steady because time derivatives have been replaced by a pseudospectral operator in which the excitation frequencies appear as parameters, can be solved very efficiently using multigrid acceleration techniques. In this paper, we apply the technique to both flutter and wake-interaction problems and illustrate the influence of neighboring blade rows on the unsteady aerodynamic response of a blade row.},

 abstract = {A harmonic balance technique for the analysis of limit cycle oscillations of turbomachinery blades is presented. This method couples a computational fluid dynamics model to a single-degree-of-freedom structural dynamic model of the turbomachinery blades. The computational fluid dynamics solver uses a nonlinear frequency-domain (harmonic balance) approach that allows one to model the blade row of a turbomachine on a computational grid spanning a single blade passage. Using the harmonic balance approach, several solutions, each one corresponding to a different subtime level of the periodic unsteady flow, are computed simultaneously. These subtime-level solutions are coupled to each other in the computational field by a spectral approximation of the time-derivative term in the Navier-Stokes equation and also by application of far-field and periodic boundary conditions. The structural dynamic model is based on a similar approach in which a single vibratory mode of interest is modeled using the harmonic balance technique. The two solvers are coupled together through the upwash condition on the surface of the blade and the resulting generalized aerodynamic forces. In the proposed approach, the limit cycle oscillation frequency is treated as another unknown, which is solved iteratively, together with the governing equations of fluid flow and structural dynamics, thereby driving the residual of the aeroelastic problem to convergence in a single computational fluid dynamics run. The accuracy of the new method is compared with two other techniques and it is shown to offer significant computational savings. Copyright {\copyright} 2011 by Kivanc Ekici and Kenneth C. Hall.

Conducted entirely in the physical domain, the approach is based on manipulating the coefficients stored in the explicitly formulated system matrices, thus the term ``explicit''.

The approach is based on analytically derived quasi-linear expressions which relate the change in modal parameters to physical non-linear elements that can be added anywhere in the system. Subject to assuming that the change in the mode shape is small, expressions for non-linear eigenvalues and eigenvectors become fully determined for a general MDOF system, even within typical experimental constraints. The errors arising from this assumption can be minimized via an iterative procedure. Preliminary results indicate that the rate of convergence is quite fast for systems with medium to high damping but more effort is required for lightly damped systems. The derived expressions provide a theoretical basis for observations made by previous researchers from an inspection of their experimental and/or numerical results: these indicate that an invariant relationship exists between a non-linear eigenvalue and its associated modal response.},

The HB method is a numerical method formulated in the frequency domain which is particularly suitable for the simulation of periodic unsteady flow phenomena in turbomachinery. Successful applications of this method include unsteady aerodynamics as well as aeroacoustics and aeroelasticity. Here, we focus on forced response due to the interaction of neighboring blade rows. In the simulation-based design and optimization of turbomachinery components, it is often helpful to be able to compute not only the objective values---e.g., performance data of a component---themselves but also their sensitivities with respect to variations of the geometry. An efficient way to compute such sensitivities for a large number of geometric changes is the application of the adjoint method. While this is frequently used in the context of steady computational fluid dynamics (CFD), it becomes prohibitively expensive for unsteady simulations in the time domain. For unsteady methods in the frequency domain, the use of adjoint solvers is feasible but still challenging. The present approach employs the reverse mode of algorithmic differentiation (AD) to construct a discrete adjoint of an existing HB solver in the framework of an industrially applied CFD code. The paper discusses implementational issues as well as the performance of the adjoint solver, in particular regarding memory requirements. The presented method is applied to compute the sensitivities of aeroelastic objectives with respect to geometric changes in a turbine stage.},

A great deal of research has been conducted on accurately modeling large cyclic structures such as turbomachinery rotors. Accurate modeling of realistic industrial turbomachinery requires overcoming several challenges. The first is the excessively large size of the finite element models (FEMs) needed, which can contain millions of degrees of freedom per stage of the rotor. The second challenge is the presence of small random variations in the structural properties known as mistuning, which arise from operational wear and/or manufacturing tolerances, and destroy the cyclic symmetry of the FEMs. The third is the complexity of turbomachinery models, which often include multiple stages that often have a mismatched computational grid at the interface between stages. The fourth challenge is associated with modeling the aerodynamic loads on the turbomachinery rotor. Much research has been conducted to overcome the first two challenges. By combining cyclic symmetry analysis and component mode mistuning (CMM), compact single-stage reduced order models (ROMs) can be created to accurately capture the free and forced response of these systems. These highly efficient ROMs can be developed from single sector calculations and can be of the order of the number of sectors in the stage. Recently, the third challenge associated with the complexity of modeling multiple stages has been addressed by the authors. Their method uses cyclic symmetry and CMM to form single-stage ROMs (using only single sector models and single sector calculations), and then combines these single-stage ROMs by projecting the motion along the interface between stages along a set of harmonic shape functions. This method allows for the creation of compact ROMs of multi-stage systems with mistuning using sector only calculations. The fourth challenge has been addressed only for single-stage systems by computing a complex aerodynamic matrix (which contains stiffness and damping terms) using an iterative approach. In this work, some of the effects of the aerodynamics on multi-stage systems are explored. The methodology consists of first creating efficient structural ROMs of a multi-stage rotor using the method previously developed, and then iteratively calculating the complex aerodynamic matrices for each stage. A new way to account for the effects of a shift in frequency due to mistuning on the complex aerodynamic matrix is also proposed. Additionally, a new classification of complex multi-stage aeroelastic modes is introduced. The presented results focus on exploring the influences of the aerodynamics and mistuning on the multi-stage response. A variety of numerical results are analyzed for two stages of an industrial rotor.},

The methodology utilized in this work combines experimental measurements with slow-flow dynamic analysis and empirical mode decomposition, and reconstructs the dynamics through reduced-order models. These are in the form of single-degree-of-freedom linear oscillators (termed intrinsic modal oscillators---IMOs) with forcing terms derived directly from the experimental measurements through slow-flow analysis. The derived reduced order models are capable of reproducing the measured dynamics, whereas the forcing terms provide important information about nonlinear damping effects. The NSI methodology is applied to model nonlinear friction effects in a bolted beam assembly. A `monolithic' beam with identical geometric and material properties is also tested for comparison. Three different forcing (energy) levels were considered in the tests in order to study the energy-dependencies of the damping nonlinearities induced in the beam from the bolted joint. In all cases, the NSI methodology employed was successful in identifying the damping nonlinearities, their spatial distributions and their effects of the vibration modes of the structural component.},

In order to overcome this issue of the conventional resonant cantilever configuration, a non-resonant piezomagnetoelastic energy harvester has been introduced by the authors. This paper presents theoretical and experimental investigations of high-energy orbits in the piezomagnetoelastic energy harvester over a range of excitation frequencies. Lumped-parameter nonlinear equations (electromechanical form of the bistable Duffing oscillator with piezoelectric coupling) can successfully describe the large-amplitude broadband voltage response of the piezomagnetoelastic configuration. Following the comparison of the electromechanical trajectories obtained from the theory, it is experimentally verified that the piezomagnetoelastic configuration can generate an order of magnitude larger power compared to the commonly employed piezoelastic counterpart at several frequencies. Chaotic response of the piezomagnetoelastic configuration is also compared against the periodic response of the piezoelastic configuration theoretically and experimentally. Overcoming the bias caused by the gravity in vertical excitation of the piezomagnetoelastic energy harvester is discussed and utilization of high-energy orbits in the bistable structural configuration for electrostatic, electromagnetic and magnetostrictive transduction mechanisms is summarized.},

In this paper, a simplified model is used to study the implications of this real situation from a consideration of the vibration levels which these components might suffer in practice.



It has been shown elsewhere that detuning---the presence of small differences between the blades on a bladed disk---gives rise to a natural frequency ``splitting'' phenomenon in which a pair of modes with close natural frequencies and similar characteristics are formed in place of an apparently single mode of vibration in the perfect, or tuned, system.



The present work describes the dynamic characteristics of a system having such pairs of close natural frequency modes when it is forced to vibrate under typical operating conditions---with excitation being derived from the presence of obstructions in the flow.



A simplified analysis suggests that the best system is one in which all the blades are identical. It is shown that with the random arrangements of typical blades which will occur in practice, some blades may suffer stress levels which are 20{\%} higher than those of the equivalent tuned system. However, by careful arrangement of the same set of non-identical blades, it is possible to eliminate the risk of such an increase in the peak stress levels.

These industries tend to demand highly efficient designs for their critical structures which, as a result, are increasingly operating in regimes where traditional linearity assumptions are no longer adequate. In particular, many modern structures are found to contain localized areas, often around joints or boundaries, where the actual mechanical behaviour is far from linear. Such structures need to have appropriate representation of these nonlinear features incorporated into the otherwise largely linear models that are used for design and operation. This paper proposes an approach to this task which is an extension of existing linear techniques, especially in the testing phase, involving only just as much nonlinear analysis as is necessary to construct a model which is good enough, or $\backslash$textquoteright: i.e. capable of predicting the nonlinear response behaviour of the structure under all in-service operating and test conditions with a prescribed accuracy. A short-list of methods described in the recent literature categorized using our framework is given, which identifies those areas in which further development is most urgently required.},

These resonances can be caused by steady, non-oscillatory, forces being applied to a rotating disc and their prediction and observation from measurement under running conditions are essential capabilities for the machinery dynamics engineer. Additional problems can arise if instabilities are encountered, either from aerodynamic sources (flutter) or from rotor dynamics.

coupled systems. It turns out that coupling may be particularly important for certain critical dynamics such as

the dynamics of a floating offshore platform about its diagonal axis. In a previous work, Kota et al. [1] applied

the recently developed nonlinear normal mode technique to analyze the coupled nonlinear dynamics of a floating

offshore platform. Although this previous work was restricted to unforced and undamped systems, in this work

a comparison of the two alternative nonlinear normal mode analysis techniques was completed. Considering the

relative practical importance of damping versus external forcing for this system, in the present work, we utilize just

one of the two major techniques available [2] to analyze damped multiple-degrees-of-freedom nonlinear dynamics.

Specifically, we investigate the effect of nonlinearity, and non-proportionate damping. Our results show that this

@article{Fang.2020,
 abstract = {We present a comprehensive study of nonlinear resonant modal energy scattering and passive vibration suppression in a linear cantilever beam with vibro-impact nonlinear energy sinks (VI NESs) attached to it. It is well-known that vibro-impacts are a strong source of non-smooth nonlinearity, resulting in rapid and intense multi-scale energy scattering from low-to-high frequencies in the modal space of the beam. We present a direct correlation between such low-to-high frequency nonlinear energy scattering induced by vibro-impacts and vibration suppression of the beam vibrations under both sweep- and constant-frequency harmonic excitations. In particular, we study the intensity of the collisions between the tip of the beam and the particles of the VI NESs by means of an event-driven method based on an explicit variable time step integration scheme, and relate the dynamics of the integrated beam-VI-NES system to the induced resonant energy scattering from low beam modes to higher ones. On this basis, the effects of the mass ratio and clearance between the absorber and the beam on the resonant energy scattering are presented. Our aim is to perform predictive design of the VI NESs for effective and robust vibration mitigation of the beam response. To this end we perform optimization studies on the mass ratio and clearance between the absorber and beam for the case of single and multiple VI NESs and identify regions of optimal suppression. Besides, since the single VI NES is only effective in a limited frequency and amplitude range -- as its dynamics is energy-dependent -- using multiple VI NESs with optimized parameters can extend the frequency range of effective vibration suppression, rendering the resulting vibration mitigation more robust to variations of the applied excitations.},

A high frequency friction rig is used to measure the evolution of hysteresis loops, friction coefficient and tangential contact stiffness over time. This evolution of the contact parameters is linked to significant changes in natural frequencies and damping of the rig. Hysteresis loops are replicated by using a Bouc-Wen modified formulation, which includes wear to simulate the evolution of contact parameters and to model the evolving dynamic behaviour of the rig. A comparison of the measured and predicted dynamic behaviour demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed approach and highlights the need to consider wear to accurately capture the dynamic response of a system with frictional joints over its lifetime.},

@article{Farhat.2014,
 abstract = {SUMMARYA rigorous computational framework for the dimensional reduction of discrete, high-fidelity, nonlinear, finite element structural dynamics models is presented. It is based on the pre-computation of solution snapshots, their compression into a reduced-order basis, and the Galerkin projection of the given discrete high-dimensional model onto this basis. To this effect, this framework distinguishes between vector-valued displacements and manifold-valued finite rotations. To minimize computational complexity, it also differentiates between the cases of constant and configuration-dependent mass matrices. Like most projection-based nonlinear model reduction methods, however, its computational efficiency hinges not only on the ability of the constructed reduced-order basis to capture the dominant features of the solution of interest but also on the ability of this framework to compute fast and accurate approximations of the projection onto a subspace of tangent matrices and/or force vectors. The computation of the latter approximations is often referred to in the literature as hyper reduction. Hence, this paper also presents the energy-conserving sampling and weighting (ECSW) hyper reduction method for discrete (or semi-discrete), nonlinear, finite element structural dynamics models. Based on mesh sampling and the principle of virtual work, ECSW is natural for finite element computations and preserves an important energetic aspect of the high-dimensional finite element model to be reduced. Equipped with this hyper reduction procedure, the aforementioned Galerkin projection framework is first demonstrated for several academic but challenging problems. Then, its potential for the effective solution of real problems is highlighted with the realistic simulation of the transient response of a vehicle to an underbody blast event. For this problem, the proposed nonlinear model reduction framework reduces the CPU time required by a typical high-dimensional model by up to four orders of magnitude while maintaining a good level of accuracy.

@article{Farhat.2015,
 abstract = {SummaryThe computational efficiency of a typical, projection-based, nonlinear model reduction method hinges on the efficient approximation, for explicit computations, of the scalar projections onto a subspace of a residual vector. For implicit computations, it also hinges on the additional efficient approximation of similar projections of the Jacobian of this residual with respect to the solution. The computation of both approximations is often referred to in the literature as hyper reduction. To this effect, this paper focuses on the analysis and comparative performance study for nonlinear finite element reduced-order models of solids and structures of the recently developed energy-conserving mesh sampling and weighting (ECSW) hyper reduction method. Unlike most alternative approaches, this method approximates the scalar projections of residuals and/or Jacobians directly, instead of approximating first these vectors and matrices then projecting the resulting approximations onto the subspaces of interest. In this paper, it is shown that ECSW distinguishes itself furthermore from other hyper reduction methods through its preservation of the Lagrangian structure associated with Hamilton's principle. For second-order dynamical systems, this enables it to also preserve the numerical stability properties of the discrete system to which it is applied. It is also shown that for a fixed set of parameter values, the approximation error committed online by ECSW is bounded by its counterpart error committed off-line during the training of this method. Therefore, this error can be estimated in this case a priori and controlled. The performance of ECSW is demonstrated first for two academic but nevertheless interesting nonlinear dynamic response problems. For both of them, ECSW is shown to preserve numerical stability and deliver the desired level of accuracy, whereas the discrete empirical interpolation method and its recently introduced unassembled variant are shown to be susceptible to failure because of numerical instability. The potential of ECSW for enabling the effective reduction of nonlinear finite element dynamic models of solids and structures is also highlighted with the realistic simulation of the nonlinear transient dynamic response of a complete car engine to thermal and combustion pressure loads using an implicit scheme. For this simulation, ECSW is reported to enable the reduction of the CPU time required by the high-dimensional nonlinear finite element dynamic analysis by more than four orders of magnitude, while achieving a very good level of accuracy.

 abstract = {A unique feature of flexible cantilevered beams, which is used in a range of applications from energy harvesting to bio-inspired actuation, is their capability to undergo motions of extremely large amplitudes. The well-known third-order nonlinear cantilever model is not capable of capturing such a behaviour, hence requiring the application of geometrically exact models. This study, for the first time, presents a thorough experimental investigation on nonlinear dynamics of a cantilever under base excitation in order to capture extremely large oscillations to validate a geometrically exact model based on the centreline rotation. To this end, a state-of-the-art in vacuo base excitation experimental set-up is utilised to excite the cantilever in the primary resonance region and drive it to extremely large amplitudes, and a high-speed camera is used to capture the motion. A robust image processing code is developed to extract the deformed state of the cantilever at each frame as well as the tip displacements and rotation. For the theoretical part, a geometrically exact model is developed based on the Euler--Bernoulli beam theory and inextensibility condition, while using Kelvin--Voigt material damping. To ensure accurate predictions, the equation of motion is derived for the centreline rotation and all terms are kept geometrically exact throughout the derivation and discretisation procedures. Thorough comparisons are conducted between experimental and theoretical results in the form of frequency response diagrams, time histories, motion snapshots, and motion videos. It is shown that the predictions of the geometrically exact model are in excellent agreement with the experimental results at both relatively large and extremely large oscillation amplitudes.},

As a result, shifting of the fundamental frequencies and redistribution of stress in the blade base possibly cause failure of the blade. A three-dimensional finite element model of a blade and its fir-tree attachments have been constructed and analyzed by taking into account contact nonlinearity in the attachments and large deformation effect of the blade. The geometry mismatch was introduced into the finite element model by defining gaps between two contact surfaces in the attachments. The influence of gap configuration and gap size on contact and fundamental frequencies was investigated. Results showed that gap configuration has significant influence on fundamental frequencies of the blade, especially on its bending modes. Gap size has little influence on the frequencies but significant influence on the contact status and thus changes stress distribution in the attachments. The results also suggest that modeling contact behavior in fir-tree attachments is necessary to obtain more accurate fundamental frequencies. Copyright {\copyright} 2006 by ASME.},

 abstract = {Wedge dampers are commonly used to utilize the frictional behavior in many engineering fields such as vehicle dynamics and turbo-machinery. However, the presence of non-unique contact forces in the damper interfaces creates an uncertainty that provides different dynamic response amplitudes even for the same input parameters. The maximum limits of the variability range always take the core attention in most of the damper design processes. In this paper, determination of an upper and a lower boundary among multiple steady-state solutions is presented by using a numerical approach. The method is specifically suitable for the mechanical systems with wedge dampers modeled by macro-slip frictional contact elements in the joint interfaces. In the approach proposed, a criterion that determines the periodic response boundaries according to the limit tangential force values is utilized. The method is demonstrated by illustrating several case studies on a lumped parameter system which represents a turbo-machinery application with a symmetric wedge damper pressed against two vibrating adjacent blades. A point-to-point 1D friction model with varying normal force is used in both contact sides. A parametric investigation on the variability range and response limits is performed for different damper configurations. Harmonic Balance Method with Newton's iteration scheme is used in the numerical solution of the governing equations. The results show that a large variability exists for damper geometries where a strong coupling is present between tangential and normal contact forces. The method proposed successfully captures the limits of the variability range in all cases.},

 abstract = {Engineering structures are often very complex and di cult to analyse for their dynamic,

or vibrational, behaviour. It is common practice to divide a complex structure

into a number of components, or substructures, so that each of these can be analysed

individually using whichever method is the most convenient. In this way, by applying

structural assembly analysis methods, it is possible to predict the dynamic behaviour

of the whole assembled structure. Coupled structure analysis is a standard tool in

structural dynamics when dealing with linear structures. Many di{\_}erent methods for

assembling linear structures have been developed and are usually referred to as {\textquotedbl}coupling

techniques{\textquotedbl}. However, many practical mechanical structures exhibit a degree

of nonlinearity due to the complex nature of the joints, microclearances in slides or

bearings, nonlinear damping and material properties. So existing methods cannot

be applied. The aim of this work is to advance developments in analytical coupling

methods for prediction of the response of complex nonlinear structures.



The work initially reviews existing techniques of analysing linear and nonlinear

structures. First, a time-domain analysis formulation and the computational aspects

of the technique are described. Then, a frequency-domain method of analysis is

introduced. Different coupling techniques for the solution of linear problems are

investigated and presented in a unifed notation. The frequency response function

coupling method often used in linear applications is identifed as a possible method

applicable to nonlinear structures through the introduction of a describing function

method that can deal with the representation of the nonlinearities involved in such

systems.



The basic FRF coupling algorithm is modifed by using the describing function.

Then, the combined formulation, namely harmonic nonlinear receptance coupling

approach (HANORCA) is used as a basis to derive a multi-harmonic nonlinear

receptance coupling approach (MUHANORCA). In parallel with these new coupling

methods, models of a number of nonlinear elements are also developed. The

MUHANORCA analysis method is then used to predict the behaviour of simulated

multidegree-of-freedom coupled systems with strongly nonlinear components.

Finally, the MUHANORCA method is used to analyse two experimental systems,

one a stationary structure with a cubic sti{\_}ness nonlinearity and the other a rotating

structure with polynomial sti{\_}ness nonlinearity. The limitations and di culties of

some of the problems encountered during these experiments are discussed in details

and the control technique used to obtain the experimental data is also discussed.



The FRFs generated by MUHANORCA are in good agreement with those

measured on the test rigs. From these case studies it is concluded that the methods

developed are capable of accurately predicting the dynamic behaviour of stationary

and rotating structures with pronounced nonlinearities.},

Mechanical joints in assembled structures cause energy dissipation due to micro-slip in contact and softening effects that play an important role in the dynamic behavior of such structures. The contact non-linearity is governed by micro and meso-scale parameters (geometry, roughness, local pressure, etc.) and as a result cannot be included in a macro-size model of a whole structure because of the computational cost. The present paper investigates the idea of using the normal modes of the linearized structure as boundary conditions on a detailed model reduced to the joints only. Since contact non-linearities alter mode shapes, they are corrected as vibrational energy increases. The method relies on a corrected quasi-static formulation associated with the Masing hypothesis. These assumptions circumvent considerable numerical expense due to the non-linear dynamics. The formulation of the method is detailed and investigated on a lap-joint benchmark.},

Assembled structures generally show weak nonlinearity, thus it is rather commonplace to assume that their modes are both linear and uncoupled. At small to modest amplitude, the linearity assumption remains correct in terms of stiffness but, on the contrary, the dissipation in joints is strongly amplitude-dependent. Besides, the modes of any large structure may be LOCALLY collinear in the localized region of a joint. As a result the projection of the structure on normal modes is not appropriate since the corresponding generalized coordinates may be strongly coupled. Instead of using this global basis, the present paper deals with the use of a local basis to reduce the size of the problem without losing the nonlinear physics. Under an appropriate set of assumptions, the method keeps the dynamic properties of joints, even for large amplitude, which include coupling effects, nonlinear damping and softening effects. The formulation enables us to take into account FE models of any realistic geometry. It also gives a straightforward process for experimental identification. The formulation is detailed and investigated on a jointed structure.},

The unsteady pressure, imposed on the airfoil contour, leads to circumferentially nonuniform and pulsating excitation forces acting on the rotating bladed disk. A harmonic transformation of the excitation forces into the rotating coordinate system of a single blade was elaborated and the complex Fourier amplitudes were determined. The bladed rotor was modeled by a single symmetric segment with complex circumferential boundary conditions. With respect to different nodal diameter numbers, free vibration analyses of the disk assembly were then effectively performed. For calculated resonance conditions, the steady-state responses of the turbocharger bladed disk were computed. By using this coupled CFD--FEM analysis, the dynamic loading of the turbine blades can be determined in the design process.},

 abstract = {Friction contacts are often used in turbomachinery design as passive damping systems. In particular, underplatform dampers are mechanical devices used to decrease the vibration amplitudes of bladed disks.

Numerical codes are used to optimize during designing the underplatform damper effectiveness in order to limit the resonant stress level of the blades. In such codes, the contact model plays the most relevant role in calculation of the dissipated energy at friction interfaces. One of the most important contact parameters to consider in order to calculate the forced response of blades assembly is the static normal load acting at the contact, since its value strongly affects the area of the hysteresis loop of the tangential force, and therefore the amount of dissipation.

A common procedure to estimate the static normal loads acting on underplatform dampers consists in decoupling the static and the dynamic balance of the damper. A preliminary static analysis of the contact is performed in order to get the static contact/gap status to use in the calculation, assuming that it does not change when vibration occurs.

In this paper, a novel approach is proposed. The static and the dynamic displacements of the system (bladed disk+underplatform dampers) are coupled together during the forced response calculation. Static loads acting at the contacts follow from static displacements and no preliminary static analysis of the system is necessary.

The proposed method is applied to a numerical test case representing a simplified bladed disk with underplatform dampers. Results are compared with those obtained with the classical approach.},

Although the overall effects have been quantified through experiments, the exact nature of the plasma and its momentum-transfer mechanisms have not been well characterized. In this study, particle-in-cell and Monte Carlo methods are used to computationally explore the plasma discharge and its interaction with the flow. The plasma composition, its methods of momentum addition, and the physics of its generation are quantified. Comparisons with experiments are made in order to support the findings. Simulations indicate that the plasma is generated through an electron avalanche in a dielectric barrier discharge. The plasma is created as the electrons stream to the dielectric on the first half of the electrode bias cycle and stream back on the second half. Momentum is imparted to the flow on both half-cycles, but the ionization is not equal during both half-cycles. This results in the plasma actuator producing a net force in one direction.},

extracting as much information as possible from the signal of a

onto the probe axis. Utilizing single probes is adequate for

isotropic systems where the projections are the same for any

probe orientation. However, for anisotropic systems the results

of the algorithm can be different depending on the orientation of

the measurement transducer. This leads to the blind men and

elephant conflict, multiple descriptions of the same animal, or in

our case rotor motion. For example, if the transducer is located

on the minor axis a great running machine, on the major axis a

machine that needs balancing. The phase is also inconsistent,

rotate the transducer a few degrees and the indicated phase

jumps drastically. If the transducer is on the ellipse axis the high

spot and heavy spot are together below the resonance, move

the probe off the axis and the high spot and heavy spot are no

longer related. More sophisticated diagnostic methodologies

which correlate data from multiple axial locations, such as

relative phase and modeshape, are affected even more than

balancing by the phase inconsistency. What is really desired, is

The capability to efficiently simulate such interactions is crucial for the improvement of the prediction of blade vibrations, tonal noise, and the impact of unsteadiness on aerodynamic performance.



The simulation technique presented here is based on the harmonic balance approach and has been integrated into an existing flow solver. A nontrivial issue in the application of harmonic balance methods to turbomachinery flows is the fact that various fundamental frequencies may occur simultaneously in one relative system, each one being due to the interaction of two blade rows. It is shown that, considering the disturbances corresponding to different fundamental frequencies as mutually uncoupled, one can develop an unsteady simulation method which from a practial view point turns out to be highly attractive. On the one hand, it is possible to take into account arbitrarily many nonlinear interaction terms. On the other, the computational efficiency can be increased considerably once it is known that the nonlinear coupling between certain subsets of the harmonics plays only a minor role.



To validate the method and demonstrate its accuracy and efficiency a multistage compressor configuration is simulated using both the method described in this article and a conventional time-domain solver.},

By consequence the turbine rotor increases its angular velocity and moves axially downstream, leading to an impact between rotor and static parts. This impact may be used to limit angular velocity below the maximum admitted burst speed. On the other hand, the impact phenomena must be controlled in order to avoid that turbine components break into many damaging uncontrolled fragments. In this paper a complete transient analysis has been developed to evaluate the motion laws during these clashing phenomena. The impact dissipation coefficient, used into the motion laws, has been estimated by a non linear finite element analysis.

 abstract = {The influence of the Blade Count Ratio (BCR) on the aerodynamic forcing of a transonic high pressure turbine has been investigated numerically. Main focus here was put on the change in unsteady aerodynamics, modal properties and the mode excitation. Using a scaling technique, six different transonic turbine stages with different numbers of scaled blades but maintained steady aerodynamics were generated and further analyzed. In the analysis a non-linear, time marching CFD solver was used and the unsteady, harmonic forces projected onto the mode shapes. For this transonic turbine the unsteady pressure at the rotor blade decreases in amplitude and spanwise distribution from low to high blade count ratios. In chordwise direction a local minimum for intermediate blade count ratios was found for the rotor and stator blades. Mode frequencies decreased monotonically with an increasing BCR. Significant mode changes for modes 5 and 6 of the different BCRs were captured using the Modal Assurance Criteria. It was found that for these transonic turbines the blade count ratio and reduced frequency are amongst others key parameters for a reduction in aerodynamic forcing. Even though an almost monotonic trend was found for the stator blade excitation, the rotor blade excitation behaves highly non-monotonic. A maximum value in excitation potential was found close to reported blade count ratio values. Optimization of certain modes is possible but case dependent, due to the non-monotonic nature. Moreover it was found that for a minor increase in upstream blade count the mean unsteady forces on the rotor blades is reduced, but the mode excitation not necessarily has to decrease.},

The validity of the lumped parameter approach is established through a free vibration study. Good agreement between the present computer results and those obtained theoretically or experimentally by other investigators is demonstrated. In particular, it is found that the natural frequencies obtained in the free vibration study for all beams examined converge from below the exact values at a convergence rate of N$-$4, where N is the total number of the lumped parameters used in the computer simulation. The rapid rate of convergence shows that the mathematical model used in deriving the basic equations can adequately represent the type of beams under consideration.

 abstract = {A methodology for determining reduced order models of periodically excited nonlinear systems with constant as well as periodic coefficients is presented. The approach is based on the construction of an invariant manifold such that the projected dynamics is governed by a fewer number of ordinary differential equations. Due to the existence of external and parametric periodic excitations, however, the geometry of the manifold varies with time. As a result, the manifold is constructed in terms of temporal and dominant state variables. The governing partial differential equation (PDE) for the manifold is nonlinear and contains time-varying coefficients. An approximate technique to find solution of this PDE using a multivariable Taylor--Fourier series is suggested. It is shown that, in certain cases, it is possible to obtain various reducibility conditions in a closed form. The case of time-periodic systems is handled through the use of Lyapunov--Floquet (L--F) transformation. Application of the L--F transformation produces a dynamically equivalent system in which the linear part of the system is time-invariant; however, the nonlinear terms get multiplied by a truncated Fourier series containing multiple parametric excitation frequencies. This warrants some structural changes in the proposed manifold, but the solution procedure remains the same. Two examples; namely, a 2-dof mass--spring--damper system and an inverted pendulum with periodic loads, are used to illustrate applications of the technique for systems with constant and periodic coefficients, respectively. Results show that the dynamics of these 2-dof systems can be accurately approximated by equivalent 1-dof systems using the proposed methodology.},

A finite-element model of the system is developed and validated with experimental results. The SMA behavior is modelled using amplitude-dependent complex modulus. Numerical simulations indicate that the damping introduced by the SMA wires will increase for higher excitation-force amplitudes that produce higher strain levels in the SMA wires. Increasing the wire cross-section area provides more damping at low force-excitation amplitudes, but reduced damping at higher amplitudes. The angle between the beam and the SMA wires is an influential parameter, and a value in the 10-20° range was found to introduce maximum damping. The underlying physical mechanisms are examined in detail. System damping depends only mildly on the SMA wire length, and is unaffected by the tip mass.},

The benefits of this configuration are that 'antagonistic' operation of SMAs on the plate allows the significantly longer cooling time constant of previously activated elements to be shortened by means of active elements working against them during that phase. This concept dramatically shortens the cooling time constant and brings it into the same order of magnitude of the heating phase. The paper examines the mathematical modelling of such a plate, and offers an approximate analytical solution by means of a hybrid WKB-Galerkin method. The antagonistic operation of the system is represented mathematically by terms in which the stiffness and damping are both time dependent. Therefore the equation of motion contains terms with time variant coefficients and is impossible to solve without recourse to specialised methods. Comparisons with numerical methods are given and it is shown that good similarity can be obtained for judicious choice of practical values for the time variant stiffness and damping functions. {\copyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

 abstract = {Wind turbines installed in cold climate sites accumulate ice on their structures. Icing of the rotor blades reduces turbine power output and increases loads, vibrations, noise, and safety risks due to the potential ice throw. Ice accumulation increases the mass distribution of the blade, while changes in the aerofoil shapes affect its aerodynamic behavior. Thus, the structural and aerodynamic changes due to icing affect the modal behavior of wind turbine blades. In this study, aeroelastic equations of the wind turbine blade vibrations are derived to analyze modal behavior of the Tjaereborg 2 MW wind turbine blade with ice. Structural vibrations of the blade are coupled with a Beddoes-Leishman unsteady attached flow aerodynamics model and the resulting aeroelastic equations are analyzed using the finite element method (FEM). A linearly increasing ice mass distribution is considered from the blade root to half-length and thereafter constant ice mass distribution to the blade tip, as defined by Germanischer Lloyd (GL) for the certification of wind turbines. Both structural and aerodynamic properties of the iced blades are evaluated and used to determine their influence on aeroelastic natural frequencies and damping factors. Blade natural frequencies reduce with ice mass and the amount of reduction in frequencies depends on how the ice mass is distributed along the blade length; but the reduction in damping factors depends on the ice shape. The variations in the natural frequencies of the iced blades with wind velocities are negligible; however, the damping factors change with wind velocity and become negative at some wind velocities. This study shows that the aerodynamic changes in the iced blade can cause violent vibrations within the operating wind velocity range of this turbine. {\copyright} 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI.},

The wind tunnel test of spring-suspended sectional models (SSSM) is an important means in the research of wind engineering, which is very frequently employed to check the performances of flutter and vortex-induced resonance of bridges as well as to identify the various aerodynamic and aeroelastic parameters of bridge components, such as aerodynamic derivatives of self-excited forces. However, in practice, the mechanical damping ratios and natural frequencies of SSSM system are prevailingly supposed to be constant in the whole procedure of a test. This assumption often leads to notable errors of the test results or dispersion of the identified aerodynamic parameters because the mechanical damping ratios and natural frequencies of SSSM system are proved to vary in fact to some extent with the change of oscillating amplitude. On that account, the mechanical nonlinearity of SSSM system is investigated and discussed in this paper by taking a flat-closed box section as a research background. The conventional linear model is firstly proved to fail to predict precisely the long-duration free decay responses of the SSSM system. The formulae of equivalent linearization approximation (ELA) are then derived by using a multiple-scale method to model the mechanical nonlinearities in the first-order approximate sense, and a time-domain system identification method is proposed on this basis to identify equivalent amplitude-dependent (EAD) damping ratio and frequency. The proposed ELA and nonlinear system identification methods are then found to be precise enough to model the mechanical nonlinearities of SSSM system. The characteristics of EAD damping ratio and frequency of both the bending and torsional modes are then discussed in detail. It is then found that the major energy dissipation of SSSM vibrations at both the bending and torsional modes generally comes from the combined effect of viscous damping and quadratic damping. However, for the vibration at the bending mode with small to moderate amplitudes, the coulomb friction damping becomes the major source of energy dissipation. Furthermore, different types of additional dampers added on the SSSM system will introduce extra mechanical nonlinearities in manners very different from each other. The liquid viscous damper with oil tank form employed in this study is found to be an ideal linear damper, whereas the steel wire-rope-circle damper of friction type brings in significant mechanical nonlinearities.},

In structural dynamics, the prediction of the response of systems with localized nonlinearities, such as friction dampers, is of particular interest. This task becomes especially cumbersome when high-resolution finite element models are used. While state-of-the-art techniques such as Craig-Bampton component mode synthesis are employed to generate reduced order models, the interface (nonlinear) degrees of freedom must still be solved in-full. For this reason, a new generation of specialized techniques capable of reducing linear and nonlinear degrees of freedom alike is emerging. This paper proposes a new technique that exploits spatial correlations in the dynamics to compute a reduction basis. The basis is composed of a set of vectors obtained using the Jacobian of partial derivatives of the contact forces with respect to nodal displacements. These basis vectors correspond to specifically chosen boundary conditions at the contacts over one cycle of vibration. The technique is shown to be effective in the reduction of several models studied using multiple harmonics with a coupled static solution. In addition, this paper addresses another challenge common to all reduction techniques: it presents and validates a novel a posteriori error estimate capable of evaluating the quality of the reduced-order solution without involving a comparison with the full-order solution.},

 abstract = {Dry friction devices such as underplatform dampers are commonly included in turbine bladed disks designs to mitigate structural vibrations and avoid high cycle fatigue failures. The design of frictionally damped bladed disks requires adequate models to represent the friction contact. A widely used approach connects contact node pairs with normal and tangential springs and a Coulomb friction law. This simple model architecture is effective in capturing the softening behavior typically observed on frictionally damped structures subjected to increasing forcing levels. An unexpected hardening behavior was observed on the frequency response functions (FRFs) of a two-blades-plus-damper system tested by the authors in a controlled laboratory environment. The reason behind this unexpected behavior will be carefully analyzed and linked to the damper kinematics and to the dependence of contact elasticity on the contact pressure. The inadequacy of contact models with constant spring values will be discussed and alternatives will be proposed. The importance of being able to represent complex contact conditions in order to effectively predict the system dynamics is shown here using a laboratory demonstrator; however, its implications are relevant to any other case where large contact pressure variations are to be expected. The nonlinear steady-state simulations of the blades-plus-damper system will be carried out using an in-house code exploiting the multiharmonic balance method in combination with the alternating frequency time method.},

The shaker is modelled as a linear single degree-of-freedom system and the nonlinear system under test is modelled as a hardening Duffing oscillator. The mass of the nonlinear system is much less than the moving mass of the shaker and thus the nonlinear system has little effect on the shaker dynamics. The nonlinearity is due to the geometric configuration consisting of a mass suspended on four springs, which incline as they are extended. Following experimental validation, the model is used to explore the dynamic behaviour of the system under a range of different conditions. Of particular interest is the situation when the linear natural frequency of the nonlinear system is less than the natural frequency of the shaker such that the frequency response curve of the nonlinear system bends to higher frequencies and thus interacts with the resonance frequency of the shaker. It is found that for some values of the system parameters a complicated frequency response curve for the nonlinear system can occur; closed detached curves can appear as a part of the overall amplitude-frequency response. These detached curves can lie outside or inside the main resonance curve, and a physical explanation for their occurrence is given.},

This paper provides a unified approach for conventional and generalised linear models of viscoelastic constitutive behaviour. Creep, relaxation and hysteresis effects of materials and structures are described consistently. Advantages of the fractional derivative concept are outlined. Mathematical consequences resulting from operator non-locality in time domain and uniqueness questions arising in frequency domain are addressed. The elastic-viscoelastic correspondence principle serves as a tool to obtain as well analytical and numerical BEM and FEM solutions of wave propagation and vibration problems by transform methods. Characteristics of viscoelastic waves and vibrations are discussed. The paper focusses on material damping but includes aspects of radiation damping description by discretisation methods as well. Important aspects of damping description are beyond the scope of selected topics of this survey paper. This is why additional reading is recommended on the following subjects: Thermo-viscoelasticity and non-linear viscoelasticity [3, 4, 21], determination of mechanical properties by experimental methods [2, 4, 38, 43], damping devices and surface damping treatment [31, 38, 43], material damping data [3, 31] and structural damping [45] including the nonlinear dissipation in mechanical joints such as bolted or riveted connections [46--48].

In contrast to previous studies, we analyze the modal energy distribution induced by the impact, having in mind the particular application of impact vibration absorbers. Also, the beam is analyzed in the clamped--clamped configuration, in addition to the free--free configuration usually considered. We demonstrate that the designed test rig permits to obtain well-repeatable measurements. The measurements are confronted with predictions obtained using two different approaches, state-of-the-art Finite Element Analysis and a recently developed computational approach involving a reduced-order model. The innovative aspect of the latter approach is to achieve a massless contact boundary using component mode synthesis, which reduces the mathematical model order and numerical oscillations. We show that the novel computational approach reduces the numerical effort by 3--4 orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art Finite Element Analysis, without compromising the excellent agreement with the measurements.},

 abstract = {An important contribution to global damping of mechanical devices is structural damping due tomicroslip effects with friction in joint interfaces. In order to investigate the mechanical behaviour in these contact interfaces numerically, a contact element in the context of Finite Element Method (FEM) is presented. The suggested element is an isoparametric zero thickness element which is well suited for the present problem because the contact area is known and only small relative displacements occur. Arbitrary linear or nonlinear constitutive contact models for normal and tangential contact behaviour can be implemented. Using a proper parametrisation of the contact area, it is possible to apply the element in contact interfaces lying arbitrarily in space and in interfaces discretized with distorted elements. This method is described before a numerical example is compared with experimental results. ({\copyright} 2008 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co. KGaA, Weinheim)},

The paper treats forced response of primary linear oscillator with vibro-impact energy sink. This system exhibits some features of dynamics, which resemble forced systems with other types of nonlinear energy sinks, such as steady-state and strongly modulated responses. However, the differences are crucial: in the system with vibro-impact sink the strongly modulated response consists of randomly distributed periods of resonant and non-resonant motion. This salient feature allows us to identify this type of dynamic behavior as chaotic strongly modulated response (CSMR). It is demonstrated, that the CSMR exists due to special structure of a slow invariant manifold (SIM); the latter is derived in a course of a multiple-scale analysis of the system. In the considered system, this manifold has only one stable and one unstable branch. This feature defines new class of universality for the nonlinear energy sinks. Very different physical system with topologically similar SIM -- the oscillator with rotational energy sink -- also exhibits CSMRs. In the system with the vibro-impact sink, such responses are observed even for very low level of the external forcing. This feature makes such system viable for possible energy harvesting applications.},

It allows discarding, since the early design stages, those configurations which may lead to catastrophic failures. Instability can be induced by different occurrences such as an unbalanced disk, torsional, and axial forces on the shaft or periodic variation of system parameters known as ``parametric excitation.'' In this paper, the stability of a Jeffcott rotor, parametrically excited by the time-varying stiffness of the rolling bearings, is studied. The harmonic balance method (HBM) is here applied as an approximate procedure to obtain the well-known ``transition curves (TCs)'' which separate the stable from the unstable regions of the design parameter space. One major challenge in the HBM application is identifying an adequate harmonic support (i.e., number of harmonics in the Fourier formulation), necessary to produce trustworthy results. A procedure to overcome this issue is here proposed and termed ``trained HBM'' (THBM). The results obtained by THBM are compared to those computed by Floquet theory, here used as a reference. The THBM proves to be able to produce reliable TCs in a timely manner, compatible with the design process.},

Damping and stiffness are independent of amplitude as long as the maximum strain amplitude does not exceed the threshold strain for material damage.

 abstract = {Radial turbine wheels designed as blade integrated disks (blisk) are widely used in various industrial applications. However, related to the introduction of exhaust gas turbochargers in the field of small and medium sized engines, a sustainable demand for radial turbine wheels has come along. Despite those blisks being state of the art, a number of fundamental problems, mainly referring to fluid-structure-interaction and, therefore, to the vibration behavior, have been reported. Aiming to achieve an enhanced understanding of fluid-structure-interaction in radial turbine wheels, a numerical method, able to predict forced responses of mistuned blisks due to aerodynamic excitation, is presented. In a first step, the unsteady aerodynamic forcing is determined by modeling the spiral casing, the stator vanes, and the rotor blades of the entire turbine stage. In a second step, the aerodynamic damping induced by blade vibration is computed using a harmonic balance technique. The structure itself is represented by a reduced order model being extended by aerodynamic damping effects and aerodynamic forcings. Mistuning is introduced by adjusting the modal stiffness matrix based on results of blade by blade measurements that have been performed at rest. In order to verify the numerical method, the results are compared with strain-gauge data obtained during rig-tests. As a result, a measured low engine order excitation was found by modeling the spiral casing. Furthermore, a localization phenomenon due to frequency mistuning could be proven. The predicted amplitudes are close to the measured data. {\copyright} 2013 by ASME.},

It is particularly suitable for the kind of system obtained by replacing each component of a complex continuous vibrating system by an appropriate lumped mass model. The method proceeds by dividing the complete problem into two stages. In the first, certain sets of constraints are imposed on the system and certain of the principal modes of the constrained systems are found. In the second stage these modes are used in a Rayleigh-Ritz analysis 0f the whole system. It is shown that the method is more economical than the straightforward analysis, and it is suggested that the errors introduced by its use can be made negligible compared to those incurred by the use of lumped-mass models.

@article{Gnanasambandham.2019,
 abstract = {One of the main disadvantages of solid-particle-filled dampers, generally called particle dampers (PDs), is that their performance is sensitive to vibration amplitude changes. The efficiency of PDs seems to reduce drastically with low intensity driving acceleration, especially when the acceleration level falls below that of gravity. In this paper, a new approach is investigated, in which the damper is filled with a combination of both solid and liquid fillings, in order to reduce such undesirable PD short comings. In order to quantify and understand the influence of various dissipation mechanisms, simulations were performed. The liquid motion is modeled using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method and the discrete element method (DEM) is used to model the motion of solid particles. In order to validate the simulation models, also a laboratory experiment was set up. This experiment consists of a damper, in this case a cylindrical acrylic container filled with spherical particles in combination with distilled water, mounted on a vertical leaf spring. By analyzing the free oscillation behavior of the leaf spring, the corresponding damper performance is characterized. The insights gained during experiments were then utilized to identify and validate the DEM and SPH models, respectively. Initially, damping behavior of dampers with solid filling and liquid filling are analyzed independent of each other. Then, these two configurations are compared with dampers with a combination of both solid and liquid fillings. In order to model solid--liquid dampers a coupled SPH--DEM approach is used. Experimental and simulation results show that dampers with a mixture of solid and liquid filling perform better than purely solid-filled or purely liquid-filled dampers, especially under low intensity driving accelerations. The main reasons behind this effect are believed to be that the solid particles with the additional hydraulic forces due to an added liquid are more agile leading to more relative motion and thereby leading to more energy dissipation. Moreover, the violent sloshing motion of the liquid through the tiny gaps, created by solid particles, also leads to more energy dissipation.},

@article{Gnanasambandham.2020,
 abstract = {Particle dampers (PDs) are becoming a popular alternative to conventional damping devices due to their simple design and their ability to dissipate energy over a wide frequency range. The energy dissipation in PDs takes place due to relative motion between solid particles within the PD enclosure. The degree of relative motion depends on various parameters, especially it is highly sensitive to vibration amplitude changes. Usually, the particle size is much smaller than that of the PD enclosure which, under low forcing conditions, leads to sub-optimal momentum transfer and thereby leads to lower energy dissipation. In this work a new approach is investigated, in which a complex 3D rigid obstacle-grid is deliberately introduced inside the PD enclosure in order to overcome the shortcomings of a conventional PD. In order to better understand the influence of various dissipation mechanisms, simulations were performed. The Discrete Element Method (DEM) is used to model the interactions between the solid particles and their surroundings. In the simulations, the rigid obstacle-grid is described using a triangular surface mesh and to speed-up the collision detection process, efficient bounding volume hierarchy data structures were used. Moreover, laboratory experiments were set up to test the validity of the simulation models. The experimental setup consists of an electromagnetic shaker used to excite, via elastic elements, a clamped beam on which a PD with a rigid obstacle-grid is mounted. The obstacle-grid used in the experiments is manufactured using a Stereolithography 3D printer. Simulations and experiments were observed to be in good agreement. Moreover, the damping performance of a PD with a rigid obstacle-grid is observed to be at least twice as good as a conventional PD. Visual observations indicate that particles which would have otherwise been hardly contributing to energy dissipation, move violently due to an obstacle-grid, and hence actively participate in the energy dissipation process. Furthermore, a numerical study indicates that the obstacle-grid cell-size has a profound effect on the dissipation, allowing it to be used as an additional parameter to tune the damping performance of PDs. {\copyright} 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

 abstract = {Under-platform dampers are commonly adopted in order to mitigate resonant vibration of turbine blades. The need for reliable models for the design of under-platform dampers has led to a considerable amount of technical literature on under-platform damper modeling in the last three decades. Although much effort has been devoted to the under-platform damper modeling in order to avail of a predictive tool for new damper designs, experimental validation of the modeling is still necessary. This is due to the complexity caused by the interaction of the contacts at the two damper-platform interfaces with the additional complication of the variablity of physical contact parameters (in particularly friction) and their nonlinearity. The traditional experimental configuration for evaluating under-platform damper behavior is measuring the blade tip response by incorporating the damper between two adjacent blades (representing a cyclic segment of the bladed disk) under controlled excitation. The effectiveness of the damper is revealed by the difference in blade tip response depending on whether the damper is applied or not. With this approach one cannot investigate the damper behavior directly and no measurements of the contact parameters can be undertake. Consequently, tentative values for the contact parameters are assigned from previous experience and then case-by-case finely tuned until the numerical predictions are consistent with the experimental evidence. In this method the physical determination of the contact parameters is obtained using test rigs designed to produce single contact tests which simulate the local damper-platfom contact geometry. However, the significant limitation of single contact test results is that they do not reveal the dependence of contact parameters on the real damper contact conditions. The method proposed in this paper overcomes this problem. In this new approach a purposely developed test rig allows the in-plane forces transferred through the damper between the two simulated platforms to be measured, while at the same time monitoring in-plane relative displacements of the platforms. The in-plane damper kinematics are reconstructed from the experimental data using the contact constraints and two damper motion measurements, one translational and one rotational. The measurement procedures provide reliable results, which allow very fine details of contact kinematics to be revealed. It is demonstrated that the highly satisfactory performance of the test rig and the related procedures allows fine tuning of the contact parameters (local friction coefficients and contact stiffness), which can be safely fed into a direct time integration numerical model. The numerical model is, in turn, cross-checked against the experimental results, and then used to acquire deeper understanding of the damper behavior (e.g. contact state, slipping and sticking displacement at all contact points), giving an insight into those features which the measurements alone are not capable of producing. The numerical model of the system is based on one key assumption: the contact model does not take into account the microslip effect that exists in the experiments. Although there is room for improvement of both experimental configuration and numerical modeling, which future work will consider, the results obtained with this approach demonstrate that the optimization of dampers can be less a matter of trial and error development and more a matter of knowledge of damper dynamics. {\copyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

 abstract = {The present investigation examines an analysis methodology for fretting fatigue in a turbine engine fan disk. This is an important problem for the operators of turbine engines, since it is a significant driver of fatigue damage and failure risk of disks. Fretting fatigue in turbine engines occurs when the blade and disk are pressed together in contact and experience a small oscillating relative displacement due to variations in engine speed and vibratory loading. Fretting causes a very high local stress near the edge of contact resulting in wear, nucleation of cracks, and their growth, which can result in significant reduction in the life of the material. It is dependent on geometry, loading conditions, residual stresses, and surface roughness, among other factors. These complexities are not just physically based, but also computationally challenging. For example, the determination of the local contact stresses accurately depends on the mesh resolution of the finite element method (FEM) model. This has been addressed using various approaches. Recently, a computational hybrid technique was implemented successfully to investigate fretting fatigue of turbine engine blade and disk attachments. The present work extends application to specifically investigate the effects of surface contact in an actual blade and disk assembly using a representative loading mission. The results show consistency with available experimental data. Finally, the knowledge gained from this investigation could be used as a basis for uncertainty analyses of an actual blade and disk assembly.},

This time-domain algorithm simulates the true geometry of the turbomachine (with the exact blade counts) using only one blade passage per blade row, thus leading to drastic savings in both CPU and memory requirements. Modified periodic boundary conditions are applied on the upper and lower boundaries of the single passage in order to account for the lack of a common periodic interval for each blade row. The solution algorithm allows each blade row to resolve a specified set of frequencies in order to obtain the desired computation accuracy; typically, a blade row resolves only the blade passing frequencies of its neighbors. Since every blade row is setup to resolve different frequencies the actual Harmonic Balance solution in each of these blade rows is obtained at different instances in time or time levels. The interaction between blade rows occurs through sliding mesh interfaces in physical time. Space and time interpolation are carried out at these interfaces and can, if not properly treated, introduce aliasing errors that can lead to instabilities. With appropriate resolution of the time interpolation, all instabilities are eliminated. This new procedure is demonstrated using both two-and three dimensional test cases and can be shown to significantly reduce the cost of multi-stage simulations while capturing the dominant unsteadiness in the problem.},

 abstract = {In turbomachinery, friction contacts are widely used to reduce

dynamic stresses in turbine blades in order to avoid expensive

damages. As a result of energy dissipation in the friction contacts

the blade vibration amplitudes are reduced. In case of so-called

friction dampers, which are pressed on the platforms of the blades

by centrifugal forces, the damping effect can be optimized by

varying the damper mass. This optimization can be done by means

of a simulation model applying the so-called component mode

synthesis and the Harmonic Balance Method to reduce

computation time. It is based on the modal description of each

substructure.

In a real turbine or compressor blading great differences in

the magnitude of the individual blade amplitudes occur caused by

unavoidable mistuning of all system parameters like contact

parameters and natural frequencies of the blades. It may happen

that most of the blades experience only small stresses whereas a

few blades experience critical stresses. Therefore, it is necessary to

consider mistuning for all system parameters to simulate the

forced response of bladed disk assemblies with friction contacts.

For a mistuned bladed disk the complete system has to be

modeled to calculate the dynamic response. In practice, usually the

standard deviations instead of the distributions of the system

parameters are known. Therefore, Monte-Carlo simulations are

necessary to calculate the forced response of the blades for given

mean values and standard deviations of the system parameters. To

reduce the computational time, an approximate method has been

developed and extended for small and moderate standard

deviations of the system parameters to calculate the distribution

and the envelopes of the frequency response functions for

statistically varying system parameters, in the following called

statistical mistuning. The approximate method is based on a

sensitivity analysis and the assumption of a Weibull distribution of

the vibration amplitudes of the blades. Both, the approximate

method and the assumption of a Weibull distribution of the

vibration amplitudes are validated by Monte-Carlo simulations.

By these investigations the influence of different arrangements of

the system parameters for given mean values and standard

deviations of the vibration amplitudes of the blades can be

determined, too. For the present investigations only a small

influence of the arrangement of blades with respect to their natural

frequencies has been observed.

On the other hand, an intentional mistuning of the damper

masses and the natural frequencies of the blades in a systematic

way, in the following called systematic mistuning, can be

investigated to reduce the amplitudes of the system. The

simulation results of a systematic mistuning has been validated by

a test rig with a rotating bladed disk assembly with friction

dampers. The investigations show a good agreement between the

simulations and the measurements but only a slight decrease of the

maximum amplitudes in case of a systematic mistuning.},

 abstract = {Recently, it has been demonstrated that a vibro-impact type nonlinear energy sink (VI-NES) can be used efficiently to mitigate vibration of a linear oscillator (LO) under transient loading. The objective of this paper is to investigate theoretically and experimentally the potential of a VI-NES to mitigate vibrations of an LO subjected to a harmonic excitation (nevertheless, the presentation of an optimal VI-NES is beyond the scope of this paper). Due to the small mass ratio between the LO and the flying mass of the NES, the obtained equations of motion are analyzed using the method of multiple scales in the case of 1:1 resonance. It is shown that in addition to periodic response, system with VI-NES can exhibit strongly modulated response (SMR). Experimentally, the whole system is embedded on an electrodynamic shaker. The VI-NES is realized with a ball which is free to move in a cavity with a predesigned gap. The mass of the ball is less than 1{\%} of the mass of the LO. The experiment confirms the existence of periodic and SMR regimes. A good agreement between theoretical and experimental results is observed.},

Transformer emf devices are based on the generation of emf in a stationary circuit, in which the emf is generated by a time-varying magnetic field linking the circuit. Motional emf devices are based on the generation of emf due to a moving conductor within a stationary magnetic field. Both of these designs can be used as damping elements for applications such as semi-active and regenerative vehicle suspension systems. The findings herein are provided so as to evaluate the most efficient device for such applications. The analysis consists of comparing the damping coefficient of the electromagnetic devices for a given magnetic field and given volume of conducting material. It has been found that for a limited range of dimensions, the transformer emf devices can be more then 1·2 times as efficient as the motional emf devices. However, for most realistic situations, motional emf devices will have the highest efficiency.},

@article{gree1966,
 abstract = {It is usually assumed that the real area of contact between two nominally flat metal surfaces is determined by the plastic deformation of their highest asperities. This leads at once to the result that the real area of contact is directly proportional to the load and independent of the apparent area-a result with many applications in the theories of electric contacts and friction. Archard pointed out that plastic deformation could not be the universal rule, and introduced a model which showed that, contrary to earlier ideas, the area of contact could be proportional to the load even with purely elastic contact. This paper describes a new theory of elastic contact, which is more closely related to real surfaces than earlier theories. We show how the contact deformation depends on the topography of the surface, and establish the criterion for distinguishing surfaces which touch elastically from those which touch plastically. The theory also indicates the existence of an 'elastic contact hardness', a composite quantity depending on the elastic properties and the topography, which plays the same role in elastic contact as the conventional hardness does in plastic contact. A new instrument for measuring surface topography has been built; with it the various parameters shown by the theory to govern surface contact can be measured experimentally. The typical radii of surface asperities have been measured. They were found, surprisingly, to be orders of magnitude larger than the heights of the asperities. More generally we have been able to study the distributions of asperity heights and of other surface features for a variety of surfaces prepared by standard techniques. Using these data we find that contact between surfaces is frequently plastic, as usually assumed, but that surfaces which touch elastically are by no means uncommon in engineering practice.},

 abstract = {High Cycle Fatigue caused by high vibration levels

continues to be a major concern in gas turbine design. The use

of Computational Fluid Dynamics methods is becoming more

commonplace for calculating the vibration amplitude of

turbomachinery blades during the design process. A typical

calculation approach would be to calculate the unsteady

aerodynamic loads at the resonance condition for each vibration

mode of interest. In this paper it is proposed that, for a choked

high pressure (HP) turbine, an unsteady flow prediction can be

scaled across a wide engine operating range using a few simple

parameters.

There is a fixed relationship between the turbine inlet

pressure and the HP shaft speed (when expressed nondimensionally)

which can be used to scale the flow conditions.

The effects of altitude, variation in the ratio of shaft speeds,

compressor bleed flows and schedule of the variable vanes are

secondary, having only a small influence on the behaviour.

This paper demonstrates that the steady flow distribution

around both stator and rotor is virtually constant across the

speed range of the engine and the rotor unsteady surface

pressure distribution shows only small differences. Further, the

parameter which is of prime interest for vibration assessment,

the modal force, can be scaled very well using turbine inlet

pressure. For modes of vibration with high amplitudes the

errors introduced by scaling are of the order of 6{\%} which is

considered acceptable for design predictions.},

This necessitates that vibration harvesters operate over a wide bandwidth or tune their resonance. Most tunable devices require additional energy or active control to achieve resonance over various frequencies. This work presents a passively self-tuning energy harvester that autonomously adapts its resonant frequency to the input without requiring additional energy. The system consists of a clamped- clamped beam, a movable proof mass, and a piezoelectric patch bonded to the underside of the beam. It demonstrated an open-circuit voltage output of 668 mVrms at 160Hz, 0.65g input excitation. Discrepancies between displacement and voltage magnification factors upon tuning at higher frequencies are discussed, as well as instabilities of the system and sensitivity to proof mass characteristics. {\copyright} Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

 abstract = {The `windmilling imbalance' scenario occurs in aero-engines after a fan-blade has come

off during flight and the incoming airflow rotates the fan after engine shut-down. It is

the task of this project to develop an understanding of the contributing mechanisms

of the post-fan-blade-off dynamics and the capability to perform a reliable numerical

windmilling analysis.

Large out-of-balance forces caused by the missing fan-blade provide a source of

excitation for the whole engine-wing-aircraft structure. Clearances which are suffcient

during normal operation can now be overcome by vibrating components, thus leading

to rotor/stator interaction, which in turn can cause a rich mixture of effects associated

with rub related phenomena. The presence of these effects manifest themselves in the

occurrence of multiple solutions for steady-state scenarios, amplitude jumps during

rotor acceleration, and vibration responses at generally different/multiple frequencies

of the exciting unbalance force.

The numerical simulation of these effects is achieved with time domain shooting

methods and harmonic balance in the frequency domain. The quantitative aspects of

these effects are sensitive to dynamic models used. Therefore, the choices of particular

models are verifed by correlating the simulated results against measurements from

a test rig build during the course of this project. This provides the necessary condence

 abstract = {This work program is devoted to studying the nonlinear dynamics of a structure with cyclic symmetry under conditions of geometric nonlinearity, through the use of the harmonic balance method (HBM). In order to study the influence of nonlinearity due to the large deflection of blades, a simplified model has been developed. This approach leads to a system of linearly coupled, second-order nonlinear differential equations, in which nonlinearity appears via cubic terms. Periodic solutions, in both the free and forced cases, are sought by applying HBM coupled with an arc-length continuation method. Solution stability has been investigated using Floquet's theorem. In addition to featuring similar and nonsimilar nonlinear modes, the unforced system is known to contain localized nonlinear modes that arise from branching point bifurcation at certain vibration amplitudes. In the forced case, these nonlinear modes give rise to a complex dynamic behavior. Many bifurcations can take place, thus leading to strong or weak localization that may or may not be stable. In this study, special attention has been paid to the influence of excitation on dynamic responses. Several cases of excitation have been analyzed herein: localized excitation, and low-engine-order excitation. In the case of low-engine-order excitation, sensitivity of the response to a perturbation of this excitation type has been investigated, and it has been shown that for a localized, or sufficiently detuned excitation, several solutions can coexist, some of which are represented by closed curves in the Frequency-Amplitude domain. These various solutions overlap when increasing the force amplitude, leading to forced nonlinear localization. Because closed curves are not tied up with the basic nonlinear solution, they can easily be overlooked. In this study, they have been calculated using a sequential continuation with the force amplitude as a parameter.},

 abstract = {The prediction of aerodynamic blade forcing is a very important topic in turbomachinery design. Usually, the wake from the upstream blade row and the potential field from the downstream blade row are considered as the main causes for excitation, which in conjunction with relative rotation of neighboring blade rows, give rise to dynamic forcing of the blades. In addition to those two mechanisms, the so-called Tyler--Sofrin (or scattered or spinning) modes, which refer to the acoustic interaction with blade rows further up- or downstream, may have a significant impact on blade forcing. In particular, they lead to considerable blade-to-blade variations of the aerodynamic loading. In Part I of the paper, a study of these effects is performed on the basis of a quasi-three-dimensional multirow and multipassage compressor configuration. Part II of the paper proposes a method to analyze the interaction of the aerodynamic forcing asymmetries with the already well-studied effects of random mistuning stemming from blade-to-blade variations of structural properties. Based on a finite element (FE) model of a sector, the equations governing the dynamic behavior of the entire bladed disk can be efficiently derived using substructuring techniques. The disk substructure is assumed as cyclically symmetric, while the blades exhibit structural mistuning and linear aeroelastic coupling. In order to avoid the costly multistage analysis, the variation of the aerodynamic loading is treated as an epistemic uncertainty, leading to a stochastic description of the annular force pattern. The effects of structural mistuning and stochastic aerodynamic forcing are first studied separately and then in a combined manner for a blisk of a research compressor without and with aeroelastic coupling.},

In a previous work, we demonstrated that this behavior can be explained by the nonlinear interaction of aeroelastically unstable traveling wave modes. The resulting vibrations are quasi-periodic. In the present work, we show that the nonlinear modal interaction is not strictly needed, but actually mistuning alone can explain the multi-wave form of flutter vibrations. The resulting vibrations are periodic and dominated by only a single mode shape of the mistuned system. However, unrealistically high mistuning intensities are needed to obtain significant contributions of multiple wave forms under the considered strong inter-blade coupling. Thus, we conclude that mistuning cannot explain the rich wave content observed in the measurements. Moreover, mistuning tends to hamper the nonlinear modal interactions and, thus, the occurrence of quasi-periodic multi-wave flutter vibrations. This implies that intentional mistuning is not only useful to stabilize flutter, but might also play an important role in developing flutter-tolerant blade designs.},

 abstract = {Increasing the efficiency of turbomachines is a major concern as it directly translates into lower environmental impact and improved operational costs. One solution is to reduce the blade-casing operating clearance in order to mitigate aerodynamic losses at the unavoidable cost of increased structural unilateral contact and friction occurrences. In centrifugal compressors, the dynamic behaviour of the structures interacting through unilateral contact and friction is not yet fully understood. In fact, the heat generated during such events may affect the dynamics through thermal stresses.This paper presents a complete thermomechanical modelling strategy of impeller rotor and casing, and of blade-tip/casing contact events. A fully coupled thermomechanical modal synthesis technique is introduced and applied to turbomachinery-related models. The blisk is reduced via a hybrid modal synthesis technique combining the Craig-Bampton method and the characteristic constraint mode method. The casing model is reduced using an axisymmetric harmonic modal synthesis. Both strategies involve thermomechanical modes embedding thermal dilatation effects. The contact modelling algorithm is then introduced. It handles unilateral contact and friction occurrences together with heating effects. This algorithm uses the above mentioned reduced-order models as input data to avoid CPU-intensive simulations.The results show that the thermomechanical behaviour of the structures is well preserved by the reduction strategy proposed. Contact simulations on simple cases show qualitative results in accordance with expectations.Further work is needed in order to validate the strategy based on experimental results. However, this methodology opens the way to extended multiphysics simulations of contact events in turbomachinery.},

This modified method along with arc-length continuation and Floquet theory is applied to a lumped-parameter planetary gear model including gravity, fluctuating mesh stiffness, bearing clearance, and nonlinear tooth contact to obtain the dynamic response of the system. The calculated dynamic responses compare well with time domain-integrated mathematical models and experimental results. Gravity is a fundamental vibration source in wind turbine planetary gear sets and plays an important role in the system dynamic response compared to excitations from tooth meshing alone. Gravity causes nonlinear effects induced by tooth wedging and bearing-raceway contacts. Tooth wedging, also known as a tight mesh, occurs when a gear tooth comes into contact on the drive-side and back-side simultaneously and it is a source of planet-bearing failures. Clearance in carrier bearings decreases bearing stiffness and significantly reduces the lowest resonant frequencies of the translational modes. Gear tooth wedging can be prevented if the carrier-bearing clearance is less than the tooth backlash.},

Equations of motion are derived using Hamilton's variational principle. Coupled equations of motion are uncoupled using modal analysis. Modal state vectors are estimated using the Kalman observer. The first mode of smart cantilevered plate is actively controlled using negative first modal velocity feedback at various temperatures. Total control effort required to do so is calculated using the electro-mechanical impedance method. The temperature dependence of sensor voltage, control voltage, control effort and Kalman observer equations is shown analytically. Simulation results are presented using MATLAB. Variations in (i) peak sensor voltage, (ii) actual and estimated first modal velocities, (iii) peak control voltage, (iv) total control effort and (v) settling time with respect to temperature are presented. Active vibration control performance is not maintained at temperature away from reference temperature when the temperature dependence of piezoelectric stress coefficient `e31' and permittivity `$\in$33' is not included in piezoelectric constitutive equations.

 abstract = {A new method for the modal characterisation of rotating machinery structures is

presented. The method accounts for the effects of gyroscopic and other forces related to

rotation, which are associated with the asymmetry of the damping and stiffness matrices

of rotating machinery. By comparison with other methods with the same feature, the

new method has the advantage that it does not require the measurement of a complete

row of the frequency response function (FRF) matrix.

The new method is based on the modelling of rotating machines as structural assemblies

of rotating and non-rotating components. This approach allows the separation of their

damping and stiffness matrices into symmetric and asymmetric portions, which consist

of the rows and columns associated with the degrees of freedom of non-rotating and

rotating components, respectively. The symmetric portions are used to derive

mathematical relationships between the modal parameters. These relationships, in turn,

are used to supplement FRF data obtained from modal tests. In this way, the amount of

measured data required for a complete modal characterisation is reduced.

It is shown that, in most practical cases, only a small number of the FRFs from one row

of the FRF matrix are required, in addition to those from one column. Thus, the

difficulties of applying controlled excitation forces onto rotating components, for the

measurement of one complete row, may be circumvented.

The theoretical soundness of the method is demonstrated using a numerical example,

and its practical application is illustrated through the modal characterisation of an

industrial test-rig. Some issues regarding its practical implementation are discussed.

It is concluded that, through the reduction of the required number of FRF

measurements, the new method enables the modal characterisation of rotating

machinery structures in less time and with less effort than are required with the use of

other current methods.},

 abstract = {Online structural dynamic analysis of turbomachinery blades is conventionally done using contact techniques such as strain gauges for the collection of data. To transfer the captured data from the sensor to the data logging system, installation of telemetry systems is required. This is usually complicated, time consuming and may introduce electrical noise into the data. In addition, contact techniques are intrusive by definition and can introduce significant local mass loading. This affects the integrity of the captured measurements. Advances in technology now allow for the use of optical non-contact methods to analyse the dynamics of rotating structures. These include photogrammetry and tracking laser Doppler vibrometry (TLDV). Various investigations to establish the integrity of photogrammetry measurements for rotating structures involved a comparison to data captured using accelerometers. Discrepancies that were noticed were attributed to the intrusive nature of the contact measurement technique. As an extended investigation, the presented work focuses on the validation of photogrammetry applied to online turbomachinery blade measurements, using TLDV measurements. Through a frequency based characterisation approach of the dynamics of the two scanning mirrors inside the scanning head of a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer (SLDV), TLDV is employed in developing a system that can be used to achieve a perfect circular scan with a Polytec SLDV, (PSV 300). Photogrammetry out-of-plane displacements of a laser dot focused on a specific point on a rotating blade are compared to displacements captured by the laser scanning system. It is shown that there is good correlation between the two measurement techniques when applied to rotating structures, both in the time and frequency domains. The presence of slight discrepancies between the two techniques after elimination of accelerometer based errors illustrated that the optical system noise floor of photogrammetry does contribute to inconsistencies between photogrammetry and other measurement techniques.},

 abstract = {This paper describes a rapid and efficient nonlinear non-resonance mechanism for low-to-high-frequency energy scattering, which is referred to as intermodal targeted energy transfer (IMTET). To present the IMTET mechanism in the most basic setting, a blast-excited two-DOF linear system with a single clearance is considered. The impact interactions facilitate rapid transfer of oscillation energy from an initially excited, low-frequency symmetric mode to a high-frequency antisymmetric mode with substantially higher modal dissipative capacity. Numerical exploration reveals almost immediate drastic reduction of the system response amplitude caused by nonlinear ``modal energy redistribution'' within its modal space. Characteristic damping time of the system exhibits a multi-fold reduction. This process requires a rather limited number of impacts; only one or two impacts are enough to cause an immediate significant suppression of the system response. The results are robust over a broad range of blast amplitudes. Matrix formalism based on eigenvalue decomposition of the state matrix is developed to obtain an implicit analytic description of the process. Then, estimations for the main characteristics of the IMTET process, such as activation threshold and expected efficiency, are obtained. The results show a rather weak dependence of the characteristic damping time of the system on the coupling strength between oscillators, and relatively strong dependence on the ratio of the clearance to the blast intensity. The findings reported in this study have potential applications for passive, rapid and efficient shock mitigation and energy absorption in engineering structures under extreme loads by redistributing the input shock energy to high-frequency structural modes.},

 abstract = {This work investigates intermodal targeted energy transfers (IMTET) for passive mitigation of a large-scale nine-story structure subjected to blast excitation. This is achieved by inducing extreme, fast time scale energy transfers from lower-frequency structural modes which are mainly excited by the blast to higher-frequency ones. These targeted (directed) energy transfers are governed by a non-resonant nonlinear dynamical mechanism induced by inelastic Hertzian vibro-impacts between the nine-story structure (referred to ``primary structure'') and an internal secondary ``core structure'' assumed to be rigid. The clearance distribution between the primary structure and the core structure is optimized using a multi-objective genetic algorithm by minimizing both the characteristic damping time of the transient response of the primary structure, and the energy redistributed from the lowest-frequency (fundamental) structural mode to higher modes. The results show that the IMTET mechanism enables extremely rapid and nearly irreversible low-to-high frequency scattering of the blast energy in the primary structure. In turn, this nonlinear energy scattering rapidly reduces the overall amplitude of the transient structural response, even in the case of purely elastic Hertzian contacts. The mitigation performance is substantially enhanced when more realistic inelastic vibro-impact nonlinearities are considered. In the studied example with the realistic model of a nine-story structure, the synergy between extremely rapid low-to-high frequency energy redistribution and dissipation due to inelastic vibro-impacts yields a reduction of the characteristic damping time by a factor of 20 compared to the linear case. We envision that the proposed concept of rapid nonlinear IMTET is of broad applicability to general classes of dynamical and acoustical systems.},

In the last decade, the problem of detached resonant curves (DRCs) has received a growing attention. However, most of recent research works seem to ignore papers from the sixties and the seventies, which already investigated the subject. With the aim of recovering this ``forgotten'' literature, we briefly review the majority of the studies on the topic. Furthermore, implementing singularity theory in conjunction with a classical harmonic balance procedure, we analyze DRCs in a single-degree-of-freedom system, possessing nonlinear damping force. A geometrical interpretation of the phenomenon is provided.},

@inproceedings{Hackenberg.2015,
 abstract = {The difference of a stationary forced response situation of

a turbine or compressor blade relative to a transient resonance

sweep is well known and documented in the literature.

Different approaches have been used to understand the effect on

transient amplitude in comparison with forced response. The

dependencies on damping levels and resonance passage speed

have been noted. Estimates for a critical or/and maximum

sweep velocity have been given.

The understanding of transient response during resonance

sweep is of practical importance for instance when running a

certification stress test for an aircraft engine, where it needs to

be decided upfront which acceleration rate (increase in rpm per

second) to use to ensure that the maximum airfoil response that

could be attained under stationary condition is being measured

with sufficient precision. A second reason for understanding of

transient response is the verification of correct, if relevant

lower, component life usage during transient regimes in

operation.

This paper gives a proposal for a simple 1D method based

on one degree of freedom (1-dof) system considerations for

estimating the transient response dependency on the sweep

velocity, damping levels and resonance frequency. The method

is verified with 3D analyses of more complex blade-disc

structures, which have been validated with air jet excitation rig

and aero engine tests. Using the results of the 1-dof analysis, an

estimate of the expected stationary resonance response increase

can be formulated even in cases where the measured data are

based on a significant deviation from the desired sweep

velocity, where transient effects would be significant.},

This model is relatively inefficient numerically. The other model, called the ``reset integrator model,'' does not capture the details of the sticking phenomenon, but is numerically efficient and exhibits behavior similar to the model proposed by Karnopp in 1985. All three of these models and the Dahl model are preferable to the classical model, which poorly represents the friction force at zero velocity. Simulation experiments show that the Karnopp model, the Dahl model, and the new models give similar results in two examples. In a closed-loop example, the classical model predicts a limit cycle which is not observed in the laboratory. The Karnopp model, the Dahl model, and the new models, on the other hand, agree with the experimental observation.},

Damping devices, such as the Stockbridge dampers, have been in use for a long time for supressing these vibrations. The dampers are conveniently modelled by means of their driving point impedance, measured in the lab over the frequency range under consideration. The cables can be modelled as strings with additional small bending stiffness. The main problem in modelling the vibrations does however lay in the aerodynamic forces, which usually are approximated by the forces acting on a rigid cylinder in planar flow. In the present paper, the wind forces are represented by stochastic processes with arbitrary crosscorrelation in space; the case of a K{\'a}rm{\'a}n vortex street on a rigid cylinder in planar flow is contained as a limit case in this approach. The authors believe that this new view of the problem may yield useful results, particularly also concerning the reliability of the lines and the probability of fatigue damages.},

Mathematical models are therefore necessary for the computation of these vibrations, in order to evaluate the risk of potential damage to the line as well as for studying the efficiency of damping measures. For single conductor lines, the so-called energy-balance method gives good results in estimating the vibration amplitudes. However, the problem becomes more involved for bundled conductors with spacer dampers, commonly used in high-power transmission in many countries, and a modified form of the energy-balance method is presented here. Singular perturbation methods are employed, along with the energetically equivalent standing wave amplitudes obtained from the modified energy-balance methods, to determine the bending strains at critical points. This gives an estimate for the maximum strain levels in a conductor, which can be very useful in the design of transmission lines and for the optimization of the corresponding damping devices.},

A widely used approach for the numerical simulation of these problems is based on Lagrange multipliers which represent the contact stresses. But the algebraic contact conditions in combination with the inertia volume terms often yield nonphysical results for the contact stresses, and the stability of the algorithm can be lost. Our modified matrix is calculated via nonstandard quadrature formulas that require no extra computational effort. In addition, the conservation properties of the underlying algorithm are carried over to the modified method, and the standard optimal a priori estimates are still satisfied.

Over the last few years engineers have become very fascinated by this method, since it enables a very realistic fracture modelling. Furthermore it is also possible to make life time predictions with the DEM. This paper shows a new way of obtaining S-N curves for metallic materials, affected by mechanical loads. For the numerical simulation of life time a virtual specimen is represented by Discrete Elements. When using this method, no initial cracks or initial crack lengths are needed. Materials always show a variation in their properties. Since the discrete variation of the material parameters has an influence on the mechanical behaviour of the structure and its life time, statistical aspects are also discussed briefly in this paper.

The choice of the Lagrange multiplier field is not trivial since not all possible interpolations satisfy the inf--sup or Ladyzhenskaya--Babu{\v{s}}ka-Brezzi (LBB) condition. The primal discontinuous Galerkin (DG) and Nitsche methods are not subject to the LBB restrictions, however, in both these methods a mesh-dependent penalty parameter is required to ensure stability [24,2]. We propose a primal interface formulation that makes use of a local enrichment of the interface elements to enable an unbiased enforcement of geometric compatibility at all interface nodes without inducing over-constraint and without introducing additional variables. We show that a local DG-based interface stabilization procedure guarantees a consistent transfer of the traction field across the non-conforming interface.},

However, nonlinear systems driven by harmonic excitation often exhibit coexisting periodic or chaotic attractors. For effective energy harvesting, it is always desired to operate on the high-energy periodic orbits; therefore, it is crucial for the harvester to move to the desired attractor once the system is trapped in any other coexisting attractor. Here we propose a robust and adaptive sliding mode controller to move the nonlinear harvester to any desired attractor by a short entrainment on the desired attractor. The proposed controller is robust to disturbances and unmodeled dynamics and adaptive to the system parameters. The results show that the controller can successfully move the harvester to the desired attractor, even when the parameters are unknown, in a reasonable period of time, in less than 30 cycles of the excitation force.},

Commonly, such bistable shapes are generated from the cool-down process of the unsymmetric laminates from the curing temperature.

Snap-through is a complex phenomenon in that is difficult to characterize using simple analytical models. An accurate yet computationally efficient semi-analytical model is proposed to compute the snap-through forces of bistable variable stiffness (VS) laminates. The differential equations resulting from the compatibility and the in-plane equilibrium equations are solved with negligible numerical error using the Differential Quadrature Method (DQM). As a result, the in-plane stress resultants and the total potential energy is written in terms of curvatures. The out-of-plane displacements are expressed in the form of Legendre polynomials where the unknown coefficients of the displacement function are found using the Rayleigh-Ritz formulation. The calculated snap-through loads are then compared with the Finite Element (FE) results. A parametric study is conducted to explore the tailoring capabilities of VS laminates for snap-through loads.},

The analysis exploits the fact that many unsteady flows of interest in turbomachinery are periodic in time. Thus, the unsteady flow conservation variables may be represented by a Fourier series in time with spatially varying coefficients. This assumption leads to a harmonic balance form of the Euler or Navier-Stokes equations, which, in turn, can be solved efficiently as a steady problem using conventional computational fluid dynamic (CFD) methods, including pseudotime time marching with local time stepping and multigrid acceleration. Thus, the method is computationally efficient, at least one to two orders of magnitude faster than conventional nonlinear time-domain CFD simulations. Computational results for unsteady, transonic, viscous flow in the front stage rotor of a high-pressure compressor demonstrate that even strongly nonlinear flows can be modeled to engineering accuracy with a small number of terms retained in the Fourier series representation of the flow. Furthermore, in some cases, fluid nonlinearities are found to be important for surprisingly small blade vibrations.},

This approach eliminates conflicting definitions, covers both autonomous and time-dependent systems and provides exact mathematical existence, uniqueness and robustness results. In this setting, a nonlinear normal mode (NNM) is a set filled with small-amplitude recurrent motions: a fixed point, a periodic orbit or the closure of a quasiperiodic orbit. In contrast, a spectral submanifold (SSM) is an invariant manifold asymptotic to a NNM, serving as the smoothest nonlinear continuation of a spectral subspace of the linearized system along the NNM. The existence and uniqueness of SSMs turns out to depend on a spectral quotient computed from the real part of the spectrum of the linearized system. This quotient may well be large even for small dissipation; thus, the inclusion of damping is essential for firm conclusions about NNMs, SSMs and the reduced-order models they yield.},

Then, considering these inverses as diagonal dominant matrices leads to an efficient series representation of the forced response of mistuned bladed disks.

A detailed validation effort of this new procedure was next achieved. In particular, it was demonstrated that this approach leads to a convergent series representation over the entire range of blade-disk coupling levels for small mistuning. The dominant parameter affecting the magnitude of the largest mistuning for which convergence occurs is shown to be the system damping with a weaker effect of the blade-disk coupling. Examples of application to a single-degree-of-freedom per blade model and the reduced order model of a blisk demonstrate the potential of this novel approach.

This computational approach is based on earlier analytical results yielding an upper bound of the maximum amplification factor in the limit of zero damping. Extensions of these results are derived first to broaden the applicability of the methodology. Next, the computational technique is described: it involves the components of one of the mode shapes of the mistuned disk and the associated frequency as the variables over which the optimization is carried out. Further, the initial guess for these variables is obtained from the analytical estimates of the upper bound. This approach removes the limitations of earlier analytical efforts, i.e. damping is considered, and the actual value of the maximum amplification factor and the corresponding mistuning of the blade properties are obtained. Limitations on the magnitude of the mistuning could also be considered in the algorithm if desired.

This novel approach was applied for the parametric study of the maximum amplification factor as a function of damping in two single-degree-of-freedom per blade disk models as well as in a reduced order model of a blisk. The results obtained in connection with the two single-degree-of-freedom systems very closely match the global maxima predicted by an existing, more tedious algorithm introduced earlier to avoid convergence to one of the many local maxima known to often exist.},

 abstract = {This paper focuses on the optimization of intentional mistuning patterns for the reduction of the sensitivity of the forced response of bladed disks to random mistuning. Intentional mistuning is achieved here by using two different blade types (denoted as A and B) around the disk. It is thus desired to find the arrangement of these A and B blades (A/B pattern) that leads to the smallest 99th percentile of the amplitude of blade response in the presence of random mistuning.

It is first demonstrated that there usually is a large number of local minima and further that the cost of a function evaluation is high. Accordingly, two novel, dedicated optimization algorithms are formulated and validated to address this specific problem. Both algorithms proceed in a two-step fashion. The first step, which consists of an optimization in a reduced space, leads to a series of good initial guesses. A local search from these initial guesses forms the second step of the methods.

A detailed validation effort of this new procedure was next achieved on both a single-degree-of-freedom per blade model and a reduced order model of a blisk. In all validation cases, the two novel algorithms were found to converge to the global optimum or very close to it at a small computational cost.

The general methodology developed herein is applicable to anyn-degree-of-freedom, strongly coupled cyclic system with two arbitrary and independent variations in system parameters that destroy the cyclic symmetry. The specific system studied may be regarded as a simplified model of a strongly coupled bladed disk assembly. Singular perturbation methods along with modal expansion analysis are applied to gain a physical insight into the effects of parameter perturbations on the eigenvalues, the eigenvectors as well as the forced response amplitudes. The study shows that, under appropriate conditions, the splitting and veering of eigenvalues due to mistunings or small parameter variations increases the amplitude of vibration of some blades significantly compared to what would be predicted by an analysis of the perfectly tuned system. Furthermore, modal bifurcations lead to uneven vibration amplitudes irrespective of the stiffness of the coupling springs. The variations in blade amplitudes are also found to be strongly dependent on damping, and the type of engine order excitation applied to the system for the same set of mistuning parameters.},

Comparisons are made with finite element predictions and response estimates given by the ESDU method, the latter being a ``design guide'' approach used by industry. Concerning the non-linear analysis, the results are given for various plate aspect ratios and vibration amplitudes, showing a higher increase of the induced bending stress near the clamps at large deflections.

 abstract = {Impulse mistuning is an alternative approach for the reduction of vibration stresses of blades and vanes. In contrast to most other approaches, it is not a direct energy dissipation approach but a mistuning based one. However, the approach is not aimed at making use of the geometrical mistuning of the structure (e.g., a blade or a vane stage). Mistuners, specially designed small bodies are placed at specific locations inside of the component, e.g., of a blade or of a vane. They do not directly dissipate enough energy to cause relevant damping like a friction or friction-impact damper, because of the small mass involved, but rather mistune the eigen frequencies of the structure using impulses (impacts). As a result, the structure absorbs less energy at the original resonance and hence answers with lower vibration amplitude. In fact, impulse mistuning is a special case of absorption-the so-called targeted energy transfer (TET) with {\textquotedbl}vibro-impact nonlinear energy sinks{\textquotedbl} (VI-NES)-with very small impact mass involved, and thus, a negligible role of dissipation while experiencing a significant amount of absorption. The energy will be transferred (or {\textquotedbl}pumped{\textquotedbl}) to other resonances, sometimes outside of the primary resonance crossing and partially dissipated. We use the names {\textquotedbl}impulse mistuning{\textquotedbl} or {\textquotedbl}mistuners{\textquotedbl} instead of TET or VI-NES because (in our opinion) it better describes the physics of this special kind of absorption. In the paper, the design and validation of two impulse mistuning systems, for a blade stage and a vane cluster of a lower power turbine, are presented.},

Various aeroelastic models have been used to investigate the free vibration and forced response problems of mistuned bladed disks. Most of these models used simplified structural and/or aerodynamic models. The traditional way to incorporate the aerodynamic coupling in the high-fidelity structural models is to use the cantilever-blade normal modes to calculate the unsteady aerodynamic forces. In this paper, a new reduced-order modeling approach is developed by using the tuned system modes to calculate the unsteady aerodynamic forces directly. This new approach is applied to an industrial rotor. The results show that aerodynamic coupling has significant effects on the vibration of bladed disks for the case studied. Also, constraint modes are needed to yield accurate results if cantilever-blade normal modes are used to calculate the unsteady aerodynamic forces. However, using the tuned system modes to calculate the unsteady aerodynamic forces saves a significant amount of computation time compared to the method using both cantilever-blade normal modes and constraint modes.},

In the present work, an alternative harmonic formulation is adopted for modeling harmonic disturbances with an intention to harness nonlinearity as a means of stabilization while achieving the same computational efficiency as a conventional time-linearized model. One unsteady complex-number harmonic solution is made equivalent to two real-number steady-flow solutions with simple source terms, whereas nonlinearity is retained in the convective fluxes of discretized flow equations. The validity and effectiveness of the method has been demonstrated in comparisons with semi-analytical results for a flat plate cascade and experimental data for low- and high-speed turbine cascades. The computational results show that the present harmonic solver is robust with much improved convergence over the conventional time-linearized model. It is shown that converged solutions can be effectively obtained using the present method for unsteady flows with large-scale separation. copyright {\copyright} 2007 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

By dividing the cycle into five characteristic stages and solving the heat transfer equations for each of the stages, we obtain the analytical expressions of the temperature evolution under the cyclic loading of different frequencies (cycle period t p) in different convective ambients (characterized by heat transfer time t h). It is found that, due to latent-heat release/absorption, the specimen's temperature oscillates during the cyclic loading, and the oscillation amplitude (\textgreek{d} stable) increases with the loading frequency and reaches a saturated value in the high-frequency range (t p/t p {\&}lt; 0.1). Moreover, due to the heat accumulated from the intrinsic mechanical dissipation (internal friction), the mean-temperature of the specimen increases with the loading frequency. The temperature rise becomes significant in the high-frequency range. These predictions quantitatively agree well with experiments. {\copyright} 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

 abstract = {Mistuning, imperfections in the cyclical symmetry of bladed disks, is unavoidable due to many factors, including manufacturing tolerances and in-service wear and tear. Even small mistuning levels can cause large changes in the dynamics of bladed disks because mistuning destroys cyclic symmetry. In particular, mistuning can cause mode localization and a drastic increase of the maximum forced response level. To study mistuning, classical finite element analyses (FEA) approaches become computationally expensive because mistuning requires the analysis of the full disk model. Recently, compact and accurate reduced order models (ROMs) of mistuned bladed disks considering only structural coupling between sectors have been developed. However, the incorporation of unsteady aerodynamic effects into these ROMs is limited despite the fact that accurately accounting for the aerodynamic blade-to-blade coupling is essential for predicting mistuning effects in turbomachinery. Previous studies by the authors have shown that aerodynamic coupling can have important effects on the dynamics of bladed disks for subsonic flows. In particular, differences in the aerodynamic damping affect significantly the forced response amplification factor, and aeroelastic mistuned mode shapes differ significantly from the structural ones. These phenomena are accentuated in the transonic regime, where the presence of the shock creates a stronger blade-to-blade coupling than in the subsonic regime, as demonstrated herein. Parametric studies are conducted for various inflow Mach numbers and incidence angles. It is shown that the effect of aerodynamic coupling diminishes when the inflow Mach number is smaller, while the differences in the aerodynamic damping values still affect significantly the dynamics of mistuned bladed disks. Also, severe mistuned mode localizations are observed for modes having separated frequencies due to frequency veering.},

Modeled populations were created using the finite element method (FEM) for single crystal (SX) nickel-based superalloy dogbone and turbine engine airfoil geometries. The modeled populations include nominal variation in crystallographic orientation, geometric dimensions, and material properties.

FEM model inversion tools quantified creep strain and distinguished it from other variations in the part populations. Resonant modes that were found to be particularly sensitive to creep strain were evaluated using VIPR algorithms to correlate and quantify creep strain with PCRT metrics. The results for PCRT forward models, model inversion, and VIPR correlations were verified with experimental creep strain measurements made for dogbone specimens. This verification demonstrated that PCRT inspections can be trained through forward models to detect and quantify creep damage in a part.},

One example is mode hopping between different eigenmodes of a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) STO. This mode hopping is a strong function of current and angle between the magnetization in the free and fixed layers, and away from anti-parallel configuration, mode hopping can be the dominant decoherence process. Another example is the linewidth of a nanocontact STO that can be a complex non-monotonic function of temperature in regions where two or more modes are excited by the oscillators. These phenomena require a generalization of the single-mode nonlinear STO theory to include mode coupling. We derive equations describing the slow time evolution of the coupled system and show they describe a dynamically driven system, similar to other systems that exhibit mode hopping in the presence of thermal fluctuations. In our description, mode coupling also leads to additional coupling between power and phase fluctuations, which can in certain limited cases lead to longer relaxation times for power fluctuations, and consequently to larger linewidths through the nonlinear frequency shift. {\copyright} 2013 IEEE.},

 abstract = {In the field of turbomachinery, great efforts are made to enhance computational tools to obtain reliable predictions of the vibrational behavior of friction-damped bladed disks. As a trade-off between computational burden and level of simplification, numerous methods were developed to reduce the nonlinear systems dimension. Using component mode synthesis methods (CMS), one is capable to describe the systems motion by interface and modal coordinates. Subsequently or alternatively, the dynamic compliance matrix can be evaluated efficiently by means of modal superposition to avoid the inversion of the dynamic stiffness matrix. Only the equations corresponding to the degrees-of-freedom (DOF) subject to localized nonlinear contact forces need to be solved simultaneously, whereas the solution of the linear DOF is obtained by exploiting the algebraic character of the set of equations. In this paper, an approach is presented to account for rotational speed-dependent stiffness in the subset of nonlinear DOF without the need to re-evaluate the associated eigenvalue problem (EVP) when rotational speed is changed. This is done by means of a Taylor series expansion of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors used for the modal superposition to reconstruct the dynamic compliance matrix. In the context of forced response predictions of friction-damped blisks, the expansion is performed up to different order for a simplified blisk model with nonlinear contact interfaces. The results are compared to the solution obtained by direct evaluation of the EVP at selected rotational speeds and the solution when dynamic compliance matrix is built up by direct inversion of the dynamic stiffness matrix. Finally, the proposed methods computational performance is analyzed.},

 abstract = {Considering rotational speed-dependent stiffness for vibrational analysis of friction-damped bladed disk models has proven to lead to significant improvements in nonlinear frequency response curve computations. The accuracy of the result is driven by a suitable choice of reduction bases. Multimodel reduction combines various bases, which are valid for different parameter values. This composition reduces the solution error drastically. The resulting set of equations is typically solved by means of the harmonic balance method. Nonlinear forces are regularized by a Lagrangian approach embedded in an alternating frequency/time domain method providing the Fourier coefficients for the frequency domain solution. The aim of this paper is to expand the multimodel approach to address rotational speed-dependent contact situations. Various reduction bases derived from composing Craig--Bampton, Rubin--Martinez, and hybrid interface methods will be investigated with respect to their applicability to capture the changing contact situation correctly. The methods validity is examined based on small academic examples as well as large-scale industrial blade models. Coherent results show that the multimodel composition works successfully, even if multiple different reduction bases are used per sample point of variable rotational speed. This is an important issue in case that a contact situation for a specific value of the speed is uncertain forcing the algorithm to automatically choose a suitable basis. Additionally, the randomized singular value decomposition is applied to rapidly extract an appropriate multimodel basis. This approach improves the computational performance by orders of magnitude compared to the standard singular value decomposition, while preserving the ability to provide a best rank approximation.},

 abstract = {Two novel methods to determine detached periodic solution branches of low-dimensional and large-scale friction-damped mechanical systems have been developed. The approach for low-dimensional systems is an extension of the global terrain method and consists of three steps: First, the non-smooth elastic Coulomb slider is temporarily modified to pose a {\$}{\$}C{\^{}}2{\$}{\$}C2 continuous energy surface in the frequency domain. Second, the global terrain method is extended to rescale the search space consecutively along multiple eigendirections of the Hessian at the solution points, facilitating the determination of disconnected solutions. Finally, found solutions are used as the starting points for a homotopy strategy to detect the solutions of the original non-smooth problem. The method for large-scale systems based on an invariant manifold approach consists of three steps: First, the system's dimension is decreased following a nonlinear modal reduction leading to a two-dimensional surrogate problem. Second, various subspaces for direct extrema, direct bifurcation, constant frequency, and constant amplitude solution detection are defined. Finally, a deterministic line search, a stochastic global solution method, and a newly developed deterministic line deflation are applied to the problem. The proposed methods are applied to low-dimensional and large-scale friction-damped mechanical systems simultaneously subjected to external and self-excitation as well as a low-dimensional mechanical system with shape-memory alloy nonlinearity subjected to external excitation. Their ability to find all solutions is discussed and compared with existing solution procedures such as bifurcation tracking, deflation, homotopy, and the global terrain method. Depending on the chosen subspace for the global search, the proposed methods are capable of providing additional detached solution branches (isola).},

Four parameters, particularly vibration amplitude, prestrain, temperature of surroundings, and frequency, are identified as having the most pronounced influence on the superelastic damping. Their influence on superelastic damping of a commercially available superelastic NiTi wire was experimentally investigated using a self-developed dedicated vibrational equipment. Experimental results show how the vibration amplitude, frequency, prestrain, and temperature affect the capacity of a superelastic NiTi wire to dissipate energy of vibrations through the superelastic damping. A special attention is paid to the frequency dependence (i.e., rate dependence) of the superelastic damping. It is shown that this is nearly negligible in case the wire is in the thermal chamber controlling actively the environmental temperature. In case of wire exposed to free environmental temperature in actual damping applications, however, the superelastic damping capacity significantly decreases with increasing frequency. This was explained to be a combined effect of the heat effects affecting the mean wire temperature and material properties with the help of simulations using the heat equation coupled phenomenological SMA model. {\copyright} 2009 ASM International.},

The vibrations are excited either externally to the contact region by a white Gaussian random normal load, or within the contact region by a rough surface input. The statistics of the stationary response are obtained for each case. The parametric dependence of the normal motions and contact area on various contact parameters is investigated. Due to the non-linear Hertzian compliance, the mean normal contact compression under dynamic excitation is smaller than the static deflection in the absence of vibrations. One also finds a reduction in the average area of contact and, by implication, in the mean friction force. It is found that for a 5{\%} probability of contact loss, a reduction in the mean friction force of approximately 9{\%} is expected. Average friction measurements taken during continuous sliding are in agreement with the analysis. Changes in the probability density function of the friction force with sliding, as predicted by the analysis, are also shown to be in good agreement with measured friction data.

 abstract = {The main objective of this work is to propose some regularization techniques for modeling contact actions in a clutch system and to solve the obtained nonlinear dynamic problem by a high-order algorithm. This device is modeled by a discrete mechanical system with eleven degrees of freedom. In several works, the discontinuous models of the contact actions are replaced by the smoothed functions using the hyperbolic tangent. We propose, in this work, to replace the discontinuous model by a regularized model with new continuous functions that permit us to search the solution under Taylor series expansion. This regularized model approaches better the discontinuous model than the model based on the smoothing functions, especially in the vicinity of the zone of singularities. To solve the equations of motion of discrete mechanical systems, we propose to use a high-order algorithm combining a time discretization, a change of variable based on the previous time, a homotopy transformation and Taylor series expansion in the continuation process. The results obtained by this modeling are compared with those computed by the Newton--Raphson algorithm.},

 abstract = {Resonance is an important phenomenon in vibrating systems and, in systems of nonlinear coupled oscillators, resonant interactions can occur between constituent parts of the system. In this paper, out-of-unison resonance is defined as a solution in which components of the response are 90° out-of-phase, in contrast to the in-unison responses that are normally considered. A well-known physical example of this is whirling, which can occur in a taut cable. Here, we use a normal form technique to obtain time-independent functions known as backbone curves. Considering a model of a cable, this approach is used to identify out-of-unison resonance and it is demonstrated that this corresponds to whirling. We then show how out-of-unison resonance can occur in other two degree-of-freedom nonlinear oscillators. Specifically, an in-line oscillator consisting of two masses connected by nonlinear springs - a type of system where out-of-unison resonance has not previously been identified - is shown to have specific parameter regions where out-of-unison resonance can occur. Finally, we demonstrate how the backbone curve analysis can be used to predict the responses of forced systems.},

In this paper the backbone curves of a two-degree-of-freedom nonlinear oscillator are used to interpret its behaviour when subjected to external forcing. The backbone curves describe the loci of dynamic responses of a system when unforced and undamped, and are represented in the frequency--amplitude projection. In this study we provide an analytical method for relating the backbone curves, found using the second-order normal form technique, to the forced responses. This is achieved using an energy-based analysis to predict the resonant crossing points between the forced responses and the backbone curves. This approach is applied to an example system subjected to two different forcing cases: one in which the forcing is applied directly to an underlying linear mode and the other subjected to forcing in both linear modes. Additionally, a method for assessing the accuracy of the prediction of the resonant crossing points is then introduced, and these predictions are then compared to responses found using numerical continuation.},

 abstract = {When a nonlinear system is expressed in terms of the modes of the equivalent linear system, the nonlinearity often leads to modal coupling terms between the linear modes. In this paper it is shown that, for a system to exhibit an internal resonance between modes, a particular type of nonlinear coupling term is required. Such terms impose a phase condition between linear modes, and hence are denoted phase-locking terms. The effect of additional modes that are not coupled via phase-locking terms is then investigated by considering the backbone curves of the system. Using the example of a two-mode model of a taut horizontal cable, the backbone curves are derived for both the case where phase-locked coupling terms exist, and where there are no phase-locked coupling terms. Following this, an analytical method for determining stability is used to show that phase-locking terms are required for internal resonance to occur. Finally, the effect of non-phase-locked modes is investigated and it is shown that they lead to a stiffening of the system. Using the cable example, a physical interpretation of this is provided. {\copyright} 2016 The Authors},

However, the contemporary definition of an NNM also encompasses a large number of dynamic behaviours which are not observed when a system is forced and damped.

This paper firstly demonstrates the complexity that may arise from the NNMs of a simple nonlinear system$\backslash$textemdashhighlighting the need for a method for identifying the significance of NNMs. An analytical investigation is used, alongside energy arguments, to develop an understanding of the mechanisms that relate the NNMs to the forced responses.

The NNMs are compared with simulated forced responses to verify these findings.},

Laboratory TMF tests are traditionally used to simulate the operating conditions inside of the turbine.

This work studies the effects of the superposition of a HCF waveform during a high temperature hold occurring in both in-phase and out-of-phase bithermal fatigue TMF tests performed on a single crystal Ni-base superalloy. Results indicate that an atypical inelastic deformation-environmental degradation interaction is caused by the modification of the waveform due primarily to the change in the mean strain during HCF loading.

An account is given of the phenomenon of normal mode localization, caused under certain circumstances by the disorder. This phenomenon means that vibrational energy injected into the structure by an external source cannot propagate to arbitrarily large distances, but is instead substantially confined to a region close to the source. Specifically, it is shown that the steady state response of the structure decays exponentially away from the source. This phenomenon, predicted by P. W. Anderson in 1958 with applications in solid state physics in mind, has been of great importance in understanding electrical conduction processes in disordered solids and can be very important in acoustical problems as well. In particular, it means that the literature on periodic structures can be misleading in a qualitative, and not just a quantitative, manner. The phenomenon is illustrated in terms of two simple mechanical models, a system of coupled pendula and a vibrating string or bending beam with mass and spring constraints.},

The structure used in the experiment was a stretched string with masses attached to it. This string was studied with regular spacings of the masses and after the masses had been moved in a controlled way to provide a small degree of irregularity. In both cases, the transmission of energy from end to end of the string was measured as a function of frequency, and also the mode shapes in the second and fourth passbands were measured so as to demonstrate the underlying physics of the localization phenomenon, in which the individual modes making up each passband change from being extended throughout the structure in the regular case to being localized in specific areas of the structure in the presence of irregularity. All measurements yielded satisfactory agreement with the theoretical predictions.},

It makes use of dimensionless numbers of a metallic friction contact undergoing small, periodic displacements. Such contacts are used in turbine blades to lower resonance amplitudes by energy dissipation through friction. Nonetheless, this approach is not limited to this field. The dimensionless numbers for characterization of the contact are derived based on a generic contact that is typical for applications in turbine blades. A dimensionless number can be found that characterizes the contact extensively. Several friction hysteresis measurements are conducted on a special test rig in a systematic manner exploring a large parameter space for the derived dimensionless number. Based on the experiments, it is concluded that the normalized measured friction hysteresis loops show similitude despite being measured with parameters spanning a wide range. It results in the possibility to design friction hysteresis tests for friction damped turbine blades in a simple and representative way.},

 abstract = {In turbomachinery applications turbine blades are subjected to high static and dynamic loads. Static loads are due to centrifugal stresses and thermal strains. Especially the dynamic excitation caused by fluctuating gas forces results in high vibration amplitudes which can lead to high cycle fatigue failures (HCF). Therefore, in practical applications, coupling devices like underplatform dampers, lacing wires and tip shrouds are installed to the structure. In case of blade vibrations the relative displacements between these coupling devices and the blades generate friction forces. The resulting energy dissipation provides additional damping to the structure. Furthermore, coupling devices, in particular tip shrouds, snubbers and lacing wires, increase the stiffness of the structure. Hence, they lead to a shift of the resonance frequencies.

So far, only effects of single coupling devices and the influencing properties have been examined. Within this paper the effect of multiple couplings is determined and compared with single couplings. The forced response of turbine bladings with multiple couplings is calculated under consideration of geometrical and mechanical parameters of the blading and contacts, respectively. The results are compared with the single coupled blading. Furthermore, a multiple coupled device with under-platform damper and connecting pin is compared with respect to his effectiveness. Especially the influence on the resonance frequency and the achievable damping is analysed. The results of the simulation are verified by measurements at a two-blade non-rotating test rig with an underplatform damper and connecting pin.},

These small deviations of the blade properties can lead to a localization of the vibrational energy in single blades and even higher risk of HCF. Intentional mistuning, for example an alternating alignment of two different blades AB around the blisk, has been studied in literature to decrease the sensitivity against statistical mistuning.

In order to reduce environmental and health risks, the vibrations have to be decreased preferably through lightweight-compatible solutions.

The proposed unique actuating principle is based on structural cavities generating forces and slight structural deformations (evanescent morphing) when supplied with fluid, air, or vacuum. The cavities encapsulate compressible, low-profile viscoelastic elements operating according to an extended principle of the constrained layer damping (CLD). The proposed active vibration mitigation consists of the damping capacity adaptation of the viscoelastic elements through their thickness variation using the evanescent morphing as an efficient actuating mechanism. To validate this mechanism, existing model of a beam with CLD was extended by the compression-driven change of the geometrical and material properties of the viscoelastic layer. The results of the preliminary studies on a generic beam are presented. A very significant reduction of the vibration amplitudes up to 33.5?dB could be observed at the first eigenfrequency, whereas in the whole analyzed frequency spectrum an averaged reduction of 9.2?dB was obtained.},

The procedure yields accurate results while also being highly efficient and is comprised of three basic phases. First, selected modes from a tuned blisk finite element model are used to determine a minimal set of measurement degrees of freedom (and locations) that will work well for mistuning ID. Second, a testing procedure is presented that allows the mistuning to be identified from relatively few vibration response measurements. A numerical validation is used to investigate the convergence of the mistuning ID results to a prescribed mistuning pattern using the proposed approach and alternative testing strategies. Third, a method is derived to iteratively calibrate the excitation applied to each blade so that differences among the blade excitation magnitudes can be minimized for a single blade excitation, and also the excitation phases can be accurately set to achieve the desired traveling wave excitation. The calibration algorithm uses the principle of reciprocity and involves solving a least-squares problem to reduce the effects of measurement noise and uncertainty. Because the TWE calibration procedure re-uses the data collected during the mistuning ID, the overall procedure is integrated and efficient.},

Different components of a structure can have different damping characteristics, and that affects the dynamic response of the overall system. Herein, we assume that damping has a simple form only at a component level. That leads to a complex damping model at a system level. A new method is introduced which identifies the component damping of a structure. This method is applied to mistuned blisks in regions of low and high modal density. The method incorporates reduced-order models, and remains accurate in the presence of measurement noise. Results are shown for a mistuned blisk with varying levels of measurement noise. The accuracy of damping identification is observed through a forced response prediction and amplification factor study. Also, a discussion on the effects of damping and stiffness mistuning on the maximum response is presented. Some differences between component and modal damping are highlighted.},

Direct time integration of full-order, nonlinear, finite element models may be accurate, but is computationally expensive. Much work has been reported in recent years on prediction methods, which reduce a finite element model to a reduced-order system of nonlinear modal equations. The major difference among the methods is the means by which induced membrane displacements are modeled. One method is the implicit condensation method where the effects of membrane displacements are condensed into the nonlinear stiffness terms of the bending equations. Membrane displacements are not explicitly modeled, so membrane basis vectors are not needed. However, the lack of membrane displacements prohibits the recovery of membrane stresses and strains from the standard finite element strain--displacement relationships. Here, the implicit condensation method is improved by adding a step to recover membrane displacements using an estimated membrane basis. Examples are given that demonstrate the viability of the proposed method.},

 abstract = {This paper investigates the acoustically induced rotor blade vibration that occurred in a state-of-the-art 1.5-stage transonic research compressor. The compressor was designed with the unconventional goal to encounter self-excited blade vibration within its regular operating domain. Despite the design target to have the rotor blades reach negative aerodamping in the near stall region for high speeds and open inlet guide vane, no vibration occurred in that area prior to the onset of rotating stall. Self-excited vibrations were finally initiated when the compressor was operated at part speed with fully open inlet guide vane along nominal and low operating line. The mechanism of the fluid-structure-interaction behind the selfexcited vibration is identified by means of unsteady compressor instrumentation data. Experimental findings point towards an acoustic resonance originating from separated flow in the variable inlet guide vanes. A detailed investigation based on highly resolved wall pressure data confirms this conclusion.

The paper documents the spread in aerodynamic damping calculated by various partners with their respective aeroelastic tools for a single geometry and speed line. This significant spread proves the need for calibration of aeroelastic tools to reliably

predict blade vibration. The paper contains a concise categorization of flow induced blade vibration and defines criteria to quickly distinguish the different types of blade vibration. It further gives a detailed description of a novel test compressor and

Taking the same approach in a simulative environment leads to substructured models, such as in elastic multibody systems or substructured finite-element models. To reduce simulation times, model order reduction is applied to each component of the system. The goal is to store reduced models that may be reused in various settings in a common database. The more precise the information about acting forces on the models is, the more modern model order reduction schemes, like moment matching with Krylov subspace methods, can make use of their inherent advantages. If the separate components are connected at many points, then the straightforward application of block Krylov methods leads to large reduced systems. Therefore, the ``exact'' information about the interfaces, that is, all admissible directions of force application, must be reduced to the most important ones. The novel contribution in this paper is a unifying framework for interface reduction techniques applied to substructured systems. The presented reduction technique is able to provide models for a database and can be automatized. Besides the theoretical derivation of the method, a numerical benchmark model is evaluated, and benefits and drawbacks are discussed.},

Parametric reduced-order models developed previously have two important challenges to overcome to improve accuracy and performance: (a) the transformation matrix is not mathematically stable and (b) the Taylor series parameterization techniques do not capture thickness variations of the structure modeled with solid-type elements due to the highly nonlinear dependence on thickness changes. Thus, herein, a new transformation matrix and novel parameterization techniques are proposed. Usual reduced-order models have an additional challenge, namely the difficulty in reducing the interface degrees of freedom. Thus a way of reducing the interface degrees of freedom is also proposed.

This technique is constructed by combining the energy balancing mechanism with restrictions (established via excitation scenarios) on external forcing and harmonic phase-shifts; a semi-analytical framework is derived to achieve both accurate/robust results and efficient computations. With known inputs from NNM solutions, the required forcing amplitudes to reach NNMs at resonances, along with their discrepancy, i.e.~the harmonic phase-shifts, are computed via a one-step scheme.

An analytical model for a bladed disk was formulated using lumped-mass beams, and a cracked blade was represented by a beam with a through crack at the root Local stiffness reduction due to cracking was incorporated using a flexibility matrix method. The dynamic characteristics of the bladed disk were analyzed for the tuned system and then for the mistuned system with cracks of various depths introduced at the root of a blade. The dynamic characteristics of the mistuned system with a cracked blade were evaluated and the mistiming pattern due to blade cracking was investigated. The mechanisms of cracking-induced mistiming were elucidated by analyzing the mode localizations and the reductions in natural frequency for different coupling ratios between the disk and blades. The results show that the occurrence of a cracked blade significantly increases the response amplitude of the other uncracked blades and therefore gives rise to high cycle fatigue damage. In the present study, the relationship between the cracked blade and its vibration response signature is established, hence providing the essential guidance required for blade crack detection procedures and for blade failure investigations.

Different contact theories for modeling impact responses are compared with experimental measurements. Based on an idea originally presented by Sears for collisions of two rods with rounded ends, a boundary approach combining Hertzian contact law and St. Venant's elastodynamics is developed to describe longitudinal waves in rods. It is shown that this boundary approach agrees very well with experimental results. For the simulation of long-term dynamic behavior after impact, a traditional rigid-body approach is advantageous because the elastic vibration of the rod will decay fast due to the structural damping and the elastic rod then moves like a rigid body. Hence, for modeling longitudinal impacts, it is suggested that both elastodynamics and rigid-body dynamics are combined into a two-timescale model. The short time behavior of wave propagation due to impacts is modeled using elastodynamics, and the state of the rigid-body mode is transferred to the rigid-body approach as the initial condition for the motion. The long-term behavior after impact is then computed using the rigid-body approach.},

attached to the beam and by adjusting the support's position according to the sensed ambient

frequency, the beam's resonance frequency will coincide with the ambient frequency such that the

harvested vibration energy is maximized. The theoretical analysis employs Hamilton's principle, the

assumed-mode method, and the receptance method. Numerical results are obtained and compared with the

experimental ones. They show excellent agreement in a frequency versus support's position chart. The

most significant feature is that there can be up to $\pm$35{\%} of resonance frequency tunability. This

achievement provides substantial advantages in power-harvesting applications. An experiment for base

excitation to simulate the ambient vibration is setup as well and the results show that as little as

5{\%} excitation frequency variation would cause more than 70{\%} output voltage drop if there were no

tuning ability. The novel design could significantly enhance the harvested energy in a short

duration of time.},

 abstract = {This paper describes a simple and fast numerical procedure to study the steady state responses of assembled structures with nonlinearities along continuous interfaces. The proposed strategy is based on a generalized nonlinear modal superposition approach supplemented by a double modal synthesis strategy. The reduced nonlinear modes are derived by combining a single nonlinear mode method with reduction techniques relying on branch modes. The modal parameters containing essential nonlinear information are determined and then employed to calculate the stationary responses of the nonlinear system subjected to various types of excitation. The advantages of the proposed nonlinear modal synthesis are mainly derived in three ways: (1) computational costs are considerably reduced, when analyzing large assembled systems with weak nonlinearities, through the use of reduced nonlinear modes; (2) based on the interpolation models of nonlinear modal parameters, the nonlinear modes introduced during the first step can be employed to analyze the same system under various external loads without having to reanalyze the entire system; and (3) the nonlinear effects can be investigated from a modal point of view by analyzing these nonlinear modal parameters. The proposed strategy is applied to an assembled system composed of plates and nonlinear rubber interfaces. Simulation results have proven the efficiency of this hybrid nonlinear modal synthesis, and the computation time has also been significantly reduced. {\copyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

A generalized Masing model is introduced to describe the frictional mechanism in steady state to enable obtaining the harmonic components of the friction force. By employing the concept of nonlinear modes based on normal form theory, a reduction technique based on branch modes can be applied to obtain a reduced order model. Both complex nonlinear modes and real nonlinear modes depending on the modal amplitude are used in the nonlinear modal synthesis approach, leading to a particular damping term representing energy dissipation due to friction. The implementation of the nonlinear modal synthesis combined with the generalized Masing model provides a simple, fast and efficient numerical method for describing the nonlinear performance of structures with dry friction devices. The proposed approach is applied to three increasingly complex case studies. Numerical simulations are carried out to demonstrate the efficiency and reliability of the method.},

A semi-analytical solution of the oscillator equations of motion, in which the times of impact are determined by bisection, is used to simulate the responses while the parameters of the system are varied. The existence of a stable 1:1 resonance, which means the response is stable and both oscillators vibrate with the period of the excitation, is investigated using Floquet theory, and predictions are made about the ranges of excitation frequency and amplitude leading to such a response. It is found that the assumption of a coefficient of restitution, defined as the ratio of the relative velocity of the two oscillators after their collision to their relative velocity before collision, smaller than 1 (i.e., modeling energy loss during impact) increases the range of stable solutions. A transmission coefficient, the ratio of transmitted energy to input energy, is defined to quantify the efficiency of energy transfer between the oscillators, and it is found that the energy transmission efficiency from the higher-frequency oscillator to the lower-frequency one is much greater than the transmission efficiency for energy flow from the lower-frequency to the higher-frequency oscillator. There is an optimal excitation amplitude for maximum energy transfer in higher-to-lower-frequency transmission, while such an optimum does not exist for transmission in the opposite direction. The numerical results are validated by experiments.},

 abstract = {In the aim of giving an alternative to chemical batteries for energy supply of wireless autonomous devices, the present work focuses on ambient vibration energy harvesting using harvesters taking benefit of energy stored in an oscillating mass subjected to acceleration. More particularly, the attention is put on nonlinear bistable harvesters which offer a wider bandwidth than linear ones. However, due to their nonlinearities, these bistable harvesters exhibit different coexisting behaviors (orbits) on their operating frequency range. Only some of them are interesting for energy harvesting because of their high amplitude of oscillations inducing high energy levels (high orbits). Nevertheless, those high orbits are coexisting with low orbits (i.e., low harvestable energy) on a major portion of their frequency range and thus are not automatically reached. This work hence introduce new strategies to experience orbit jumps from low to high orbits playing with different parameters of the bistable harvester. Preliminary analyses based on energy considerations demonstrates that the most technically achievable strategy, adopted for the experimental analysis, is the orbit jump with fast modifications of its buckling level. More particularly, the bistable harvester is first quickly over-buckled at a particular instant and then quickly released to its initial buckling level when the mass reaches a maximum of displacement (in order to maximize the potential energy brought to the mass). Two elements of this strategy were adjustable: the amplitude of the buckling level variation and the instant at which this change starts. Experimental results show that choosing a good combination of those two elements leads to a high probability to jump from low to high orbits on the whole frequency range concerned by high orbits (from 70{\%} chance to 100{\%} chance to jump). Thanks to this orbit jump technique, the high orbits can be ensured for the considered bistable harvester on a continuous wide frequency range of 50 Hz (from 20 Hz to 70 Hz) on which the mean harvested power varies from 20 \textgreek{m}W to 500 \textgreek{m}W. Finally, it is shown that the energy consumed to ensure the orbit jump can be recovered within 2 s.},

Friction is exploited as the mechanism to move the object in a desired direction and to stop and self-align the mass at a desired end position with the smallest possible positioning error. In the modeling and analysis of the system, theory of discontinuous dynamical systems is used. Analytic solutions can be derived for a model based on Coulomb friction and an intuitively chosen table acceleration profile, which allows for a classification of different possible types of motion. Local stability and convergence is proven for the solutions of the system, if a constant Coulomb friction coefficient is used. Next, near the desired end position, the Coulomb friction coefficient is increased (e.g. by changing the roughness of the table surface) in order to stop the object. In the transition region from low friction to high friction coefficient, it is shown that, under certain conditions, accumulation of the object to a unique end position occurs. This behavior can be studied analytically and a mapping is given for subsequent stick positions.},

It is concluded that for impact velocities small compared with the propagation velocity of elastic waves in the specimen, a negligible proportion of the original kinetic energy of the small body is transferred to the specimen by the collision. The result is of some interest in justifying tlie validity of the Hertz theory for collisions between a small and a massive body. While experimental evidence for the impact of steel ball bearings on massive glass specimens shows some measure of agreement with these theoretical conclusions, results obtained for steel specimens are somewhat at variance, the observed values of the coefficient of restitution (0.90--0.95) indicating absorption of 10 {\%}--20 {\%} of the initial kinetic energy of the ball.

Practical experience has indicated that a deterministic optimization for discrete operating conditions can result in dramatically inferior performance when the actual operating conditions are different from the (somewhat arbitrarily selected) design conditions used during the optimization. Extensions from single-point to multipoint optimization have proven unable to remedy this problem of localized optimization adequately near the sampled operating conditions. An intrinsically statistical approach is presented, and how the shortcomings of traditional optimization methods can be overcome is demonstrated. We discuss two algorithms. The first one is based on a numerical evaluation of the expectation integral during each optimization step. The second one is based on a closed-form second-order analytic approximation of the integration. The airfoil geometry optimization example (inviscid Euler flow) also reveals how the relative likelihood of each of the operating conditions is automatically taken into consideration during the optimization process. This is a key advantage over the use of multipoint methods.},

Under harmonic excitation the nonstationary response of multimode interaction is considered in the neighborhood of fourth-order internal resonance condition. The response dynamic characteristics are examined via three different approaches. These are the multiple scales method, numerical simulation, and experimental testing. The model considered is a clamped-clamped beam with initial static axial load. Under certain values of the static load the first three normal modes are nonlinearly coupled and this coupling results in a fourth-order internal resonance. The method of multiple time scales yields nonstationary response in the neighborhood of internal resonance. Within a small range of internal detuning parameter the third mode, which is externally excited, is found to transfer energy to the first two modes. Outside this region, the response is governed by a unimodal response of the third mode which follows the Duffing oscillator characteristics. The bifurcation diagram which represents the boundaries that separate unimodal and mixed mode responses is obtained in terms of the excitation level, damping ratios, and internal resonance detuning parameter. The domains of attraction of the two response regimes are also obtained. The numerical simulation of the original equations of motion suggested the occurrence of complex response characteristics for certain values of damping ratios and excitation amplitude. Both numerical integration and experimental results reveal the occurrence of multifurcation as reflected by multi-maxima of the response probability density curves.},

 abstract = {The theory of nonlinear vibration isolation has witnessed significant developments due to pressing demands for the protection of structural installations, nuclear reactors, mechanical components, and sensitive instruments from earthquake ground motion, shocks, and impact loads. In view of these demands, engineers and physicists have developed different types of nonlinear vibration isolators. This article presents a comprehensive assessment of recent developments of nonlinear isolators in the absence of active control means. It does not deal with other means of linear or nonlinear vibration absorbers. It begins with the basic concept and features of nonlinear isolators and inherent nonlinear phenomena. Specific types of nonlinear isolators are then discussed, including ultra-low-frequency isolators. For vertical vibration isolation, the treatment of the Euler spring isolator is based on the post-buckling dynamic characteristics of the column elastica and axial stiffness. Exact and approximate analyses of axial stiffness of the post-buckled Euler beam are outlined. Different techniques of reducing the resonant frequency of the isolator are described. Another group is based on the Gospodnetic--Frisch-Fay beam, which is free to slide on two supports. The restoring force of this beam resembles to a great extent the restoring roll moment of biased ships. The base isolation of buildings, bridges, and liquid storage tanks subjected to earthquake ground motion is then described. Base isolation utilizes friction elements, laminated-rubber bearings, and the friction pendulum. Nonlinear viscoelastic and composite material springs, and smart material elements are described in terms of material mechanical characteristics and the dependence of their transmissibility on temperature and excitation amplitude. The article is closed by conclusions, which highlight resolved and unresolved problems and recommendations for future research directions.},

The element is based on the higher-order shear deformation theory satisfying interlayer continuity of displacements and transverse shear stress, and top-bottom conditions on the latter. The periodic responses are obtained using shooting technique coupled with Newmark time marching and arc length continuation algorithm developed. The second order governing differential equations of motion are solved without transforming to the first order differential equations thereby resulting in a computationally more efficient algorithm. The effects of excitation amplitude, support conditions and beam curvature on the frequency versus response amplitude relation are highlighted. The typical frequency response curves for isotropic and cross-ply laminated curved beams are presented. Phenomenon of strong modal interactions is observed.},

@phdthesis{ind2004,
 abstract = {The thesis focuses on the application of non-intrusive modal test methods to a class of

structures that require careful handling due to their delicate or critical nature. The test

related problems associated with these types of structure are discussed, as are the

requirements for their accurate dynamic characterisation. Previous works on nonintrusive

test methods are reviewed against these requirements and conclusions are

drawn as to where more research or alternative approaches are necessary.



From the review, the Laser Doppler Vibrometer (LDV) is selected as the most

versatile and easy to deploy of the available non-contacting response measurement

methods. The LDV's continuously scanning capability is explored and extended to

encompass axi-symmetric structures such as cylinders and cones, which are common

shapes for the structures of specific interest. The application of the LDV in

conjunction with hammer testing is also demonstrated on a delicate structure,

illustrating how this minimally intrusive test configuration can provide the high

quality of data required for model validation purposes.



The review also highlights the problems associated with existing, non-contacting

excitation methods and in particular those associated with force measurement. The

theory for indirect testing, a possible alternative approach to completely noncontacting

testing, is introduced. The concept of indirect testing is explored through

virtual testing, the simulation and rehearsal of experiments in a computer. These

virtual tests demonstrate that the calculations used for the indirect testing of structures

can behave erratically if the test fixtures used are not carefully designed. Criteria for

the design of indirect test fixtures are established and two possible indirect testing

methods (FRF-based and ``model-and-remove'') are introduced. These two methods

are then demonstrated in two case studies, a simple free-free beam, and a more

complex, purpose built structure, which is similar to the structures of specific interest.



Finally, conclusions as to the successes/failures of the techniques introduced in the

thesis are given and suggestions for areas of further study are made.},

 abstract = {Mechanical vibration in a drive-train can affect the operation of the system and must be kept below structural thresholds. For this reason tuned vibration absorbers (TVA) are usually employed. They are optimally designed for a single degree of freedom system using the Den Hartog technique. On the other hand, vibrations can be used to produce electrical energy exploitable locally avoiding the issues to transfer it from stationary devices to rating parts. Thus, the design of an integrated device for energy harvesting and vibration reduction is proposed to be employed in the drive-train. By investigation of the dynamic torque in the system under real operation, the accuracy of a numerical model for the multibody is evaluated. In this study, this model is initially used for the definition of the TVA. An energetic procedure is applied in order to reduce the multibody in an equivalent single degree of freedom system for a particular natural mode. Hence, the design parameters of the absorber are obtained. Furthermore, the introduction of the TVA in the model is considered to evaluate the vibration reduction. Finally, an evaluation of the power generated by the piezo transducer and its feedback on the dynamic of the drive-train is performed.},

Thereby, the influence of the change of the natural frequencies due

Basically, the approximate formulas are based on a linear change of

natural frequencies versus time and on a linear viscous type of

 abstract = {Accurate prediction of the vibration response of aircraft engine

assemblies is of great importance when estimating both the performance

and the lifetime of their individual components. In the case of

underplatform dampers, for example, the motion at the frictional

interfaces can lead to a highly nonlinear dynamic response and cause

fretting wear at the contact. The latter will change the contact

conditions of the interface and consequently impact the nonlinear

dynamic response of the entire assembly. Accurate prediction of the

nonlinear dynamic response over the lifetime of the assembly must

include the impact of fretting wear. A multiscale approach that

incorporates wear into the nonlinear dynamic analysis is proposed, and

its viability is demonstrated for an underplatform damper system. The

nonlinear dynamic response is calculated with a multiharmonic balance

approach, and a newly developed semi-analytical contact solver is used

to obtain the contact conditions at the blade-damper interface with high

accuracy and low computational cost. The calculated contact conditions

are used in combination with the energy wear approach to compute the

fretting wear at the contact interface. The nonlinear dynamic model of

the blade-damper system is then updated with the worn profile and its

dynamic response is recomputed. A significant impact of fretting wear on

the nonlinear dynamic behavior of the blade-damper system was observed,

highlighting the sensitivity of the nonlinear dynamic response to

changes at the contact interface. The computational speed and robustness

 abstract = {High-cycle fatigue caused by large resonance stresses remains one of the

most common causes of turbine blade failures. Friction dampers are one

of the most effective and practical solutions to limit the vibration

amplitudes, and shift the resonance frequencies of the turbine

assemblies far from operating speeds. However, predicting the effects of

under-platform dampers on the dynamics of the blades with good accuracy

still represents a major challenge today, due to the complex nature of

the nonlinear forces at the interface, characterised by transitions

between stick, slip, and separation conditions. The most common

modelling approaches developed recently are based on the explicit FE

model for the damper, and on a dense grid of 3D contact elements

comprised of Jenkins elements, or on a single 2D microslip element on

each surface. In this paper, a combination of the two approaches is

proposed. A 3D microslip element, based on a modified Valanis model is

proposed and a series of these elements are used to describe the contact

interface. This new approach allows to implicitly account for the

microscale energy dissipation as well as the pressure-dependent contact

stiffness caused by the roughness of the contact surface. The proposed

model and its predicting capabilities are then evaluated against a

simplified blade-damper model, based on an under-platform damper test

rig recently developed by the authors. A semi-analytical contact solver

is used to tune the parameters of the contact element starting from the

profilometer measurements of the real damper surface. A comparison with

a more simplistic modelling approach based on macroslip contact

elements, highlights the improved accuracy of the new model to predict

the experimental nonlinear response, when information about the surface

roughness is available. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This work is a further investigation of the effect of crack closure on the frequency changes of cracked cantilever beams. This closure causes the frequency response function to exhibit non-linear characteristics. The study has been conducted by using both computer simulations and experimental modal analysis. Crack flexibilities for open and closed positions have been identified for several crack depths. The effect of static preloading on crack closure also has been studied. It is shown here that this preloading can cause the fatigue crack to remain open. Also computed are bounds of frequency changes due to continuously open cracks and cracks that open and close. Both simulations and experimental results lead to the conclusion that, relying on the drop in the natural frequencies alone, especially the higher modes, may lead to serious underestimation of the crack severity.

 abstract = {This paper attempts to characterize the various methods that may be used in defining the vibration features of a plate dimensionally proportioned to represent a turbine compressor blade. The comparison is specifically devoted towards certain damping properties of a titanium plate coated with magnesium aluminate spinel (mag spinel). Two different coating thicknesses were tested: 0.13  mm  (.005  in.) per side and 0.25  mm  (.010  in.) per side [total thicknesses of 0.25  mm  (.010  in.) and 0.51  mm  (.020  in.)]. In order for the reader to appreciate the experimental variations possible in this undertaking, the writers define various tests performed. Dynamic ping tests were conducted on all specimens to determine their resonance frequencies. Laser vibrometry was used to determine the mode at each resonance frequency. Damping ratios were determined through the use of sine sweeps. It is important that damping characteristics be measured very precisely. Thus, in the approach using a sine sweep, one must make sure that the rate of sweep is sufficiently slow to evaluate the proper frequency response function. A discussion of the proper rate is provided. This project demonstrated that, in order to represent the basic damping properties of a coating, one must consider the rate of the dynamic load application. The usual method associated with the damping coefficient evaluation is referred to as the half-power method. The true value of the damping coefficient is directly associated with the rate of experimental power versus frequency.},

 abstract = {Viscoelastic materials are commonly used for passive treatment in many applications. They exhibit a specific behavior depending on frequency and temperature, and thus damping performances can strongly vary in an uncertain environment for which these materials can be used far from their optimal nominal value. The problem studied in this paper is the compromise to find between damping efficiency and robustness to lack-of-knowledge when using structure with viscoelastic components. This question is illustrated on a damper made of a steel frame, considering two kinds of viscoelastic materials: the tBA-PEGDMA which is a viscoelastic material that exhibits very good performances but a very sensitive behavior according to frequency and temperature, and the silicone rubber SI 965 which is less efficient but whose behavior is less frequency- and temperature-dependent than the tBA-PEGDMA. In order to evaluate the performances, a complex eigenvalue analysis is performed on the finite element model of the damper, with different rheological material models. In a very original way, the temperature is introduced in the model to investigate its influence on the modal damping. In this context, and using the developed methodologies, a robustness study is performed using the info-gap theory to evaluate the modal damping performances for the two considered viscoelastic materials in an uncertain temperature environment. It is shown that the best design choice in terms of viscoelastic behavior really depends on the degree of lack-of-knowledge: robust and better performances can be obtained while quantifying the horizon of uncertainty.},

The safety of turbomachines requires controlling the risks caused by contacts occurring between fixed and rotating parts. Undesirable phenomena induced by bladed wheel/casing interactions are caused by the forced excitation of the natural modes of a blade leading to its damage or by potentially dangerous couplings between the modes of the casing and those of the wheel. Rotor--stator contacts may also lead to various types of dangerous behavior, including the well known configurations of dry whirl and dry whip. The paper proposes a large-scale literature review and examines existing numerical models and experimental setups used for highlighting the phenomenology involved in different rotor to stator contacts configurations. It confirms the great complexity of the problems which, by nature, are considerably nonlinear and involve multiphysics and multiscale coupled behaviors.},

 abstract = {Abstract The importance of lightweight structures has increased in the last years motivated by the goals of improving efficiency of vehicles and conserving resources. In most cases the loss of weight by using fewer or lighter materials is accompanied by a reduction of the structures stiffness having a strong effect on occuring vibrations. Even if the damping ratio of the structure remains unchanged, by reducing weight and stiffness the vibration amplitudes might increase if the vibration excitation stays the same. Damping elements might be introduced to the structure mitigating critical resonance gains of the structure to reduce these vibrations. In this work the dynamics of a linear multiple degrees of freedom structure with a nonlinear damping element are investigated. The damping element is chosen to have a nonlinear characteristic to allow for a situation adaptive design. Numerical parameter studies are carried out to optimize the resulting damping of the entire structure. The nonlinear equation of motion is solved by applying the Harmonic Balance Method. The evaluation of the performance of the nonlinear damping element is done by consideration of the nonlinear frequency response functions of the structure.},

The motion of autonomous nonlinear non-conservative mechanical systems is in general non-periodic which contradicts the computation of their nonlinear modes as natural periodic solutions. Utilizing the harmonic balance method (HBM) two approaches for nonlinear mode computation of non-conservative systems exist -- the so called concept of complex nonlinear modes (CNM) and the extension of the periodic motion concept (E-PMC). Each nonlinear mode computed using one of these methods is then described by its frequency, damping, the harmonics, and the corresponding phase angles of each degree of freedom as functions of the generalized amplitude. Applying averaging methods transient system responses of the system can be efficiently computed regarding one nonlinear mode. In this work differences between complex nonlinear modes and the extended periodic motion concept as well as corresponding results will be addressed.},

 abstract = {Limit cycle solutions of self-excited dynamic systems can be determined by continuation of solutions along a system parameter variation or by brute-force testing. While the brute-force search for basins of attraction is computationally intractable, continuation methods compute only those branches that are connected to others, thus neglecting a-priori unknown solutions and detached branches, such as isolas. In this work, a method is proposed for finding limit cycles of self-excited dynamic systems. The method is based on the continuation of nonlinear modes for non-conservative systems, for which the Extended Periodic Motion Concept (E-PMC) is applied. The E-PMC allows for finding stable and unstable periodic solutions along the nonlinear mode and is especially helpful for determining solutions that are detached from other solution branches. Hence, the a-priori selection of proper initial conditions for the limit cycle computation is no longer necessary. A self-excited frictional oscillator with cubic stiffness terms is studied. The proposed technique proves to be robust and finds all isolated periodic solutions that were published previously by other authors. In an extended model configuration, the E-PMC finds co-existing stable limit cycles and unstable periodic orbits, one of which gives rise to hyper-chaotic motion with multiple positive Lyapunov exponents.},

@article{jais1994,
 abstract = {Turbine blade vibration can be caused by numerous sources, but comes primarily from non-uniformities in the flow path. The frequency of excitation from these sources occurs at harmonics of the operating speed. As turbine blades are very flexible members, a number of their natural frequencies can be in the region of nozzle excitation frequencies. When the frequency of any of these harmonics coincides with one of the several natural frequencies, resonance takes place. The stress during this resonant blade vibration is directly related to the excitation force and the damping present in the system. The usual approach adapted for the reduction of the vibratory stress in turbine blades is to introduce dampers in the form of damping pins, damping wire and lacing wire. However, a poorly designed and assembled damper may prove to be inadequate in reducing the vibratory stress and hence its damping characteristics should be established. The paper presents an experimental method to determine the damping ratio for these configurations under rotating conditions and demonstrates the utility of measured damping values to calculate analytically the magnitude of the resonant stress.},

 abstract = {Platform dampers are commonly used in turbomachinery to reduce

the vibration amplitudes of the turbine blades. A blade-to-blade

platform damper is simply a piece of metal which is pressed against two

adjacent blade platforms by centrifugal force. Relative motions of the

platforms lead to slip in the contacts and friction damping is provided in

the system. The studied platform damper is designed with inclined

contact surfaces. This type of damper is often called a cottage-roof

damper or wedge damper. The inclination of the contact surfaces leads

to variation of the normal load, which complicates the analysis of such

dampers.

In this paper, a simulation model is presented for a tuned bladed

disk with cottage-roof dampers. This model includes normal load

variation on the contact and a friction interface model valid for both

macroslip and microslip. The elasticity of the damper body is often an

important parameter for the performance of the damper and is included

in the model.

A comparison between solving the equation of motion in the

frequency domain and the time domain is performed. It is found that the

frequency domain solution with the fundamental frequency alone gives

a result close to the time domain solution. The simulation model is

validated with experimental data and it is found that the reduction of the

resonance amplitude agrees well for the tested dampers.

A parametric study is performed to find the optimal friction damper

design. The studied parameters are the inclination of the contact surface,

the coefficient of friction and the damper body stiffness. It is found that

an increase in inclination of the contact surface and an increase in the

coefficient of friction lead to a reduction of the optimal damper mass. An

increase of the damper body stiffness results in a decrease of the

resonance amplitude of the blade tip, particularly for high damper

masses.},

@article{jaum2010,
 abstract = {Aeronautical structures are commonly assembled with bolted joints in which friction phenomena, in combination with slapping in the joint, provide damping on the dynamic behavior. Some models, mostly nonlinear, have consequently been developed and the harmonic balance method (HBM) is adapted to compute nonlinear response functions in the frequency domain. The basic idea is to develop the response as Fourier series and to solve equations linking Fourier coefficients. One specific HBM feature is that response accuracy improves as the number of harmonics increases, at the expense of larger computational time. Thus this paper presents an original adaptive HBM which adjusts the number of retained harmonics for a given precision and for each frequency value. The new proposed algorithm is based on the observation of the relative variation of an approximate strain energy for two consecutive numbers of harmonics. The developed criterion takes the advantage of being calculated from Fourier coefficients avoiding time integration and is also expressed in a condensation case. However, the convergence of the strain energy has to be smooth on tested harmonics and this constitutes a limitation of the method. Condensation and continuation methods are used to accelerate calculation. An application case is selected to illustrate the efficiency of the method and is composed of an asymmetrical two cantilever beam system linked by a bolted joint represented by a nonlinear LuGre model. The practice of adaptive HBM shows that, for a given value of the criterion, the number of harmonics increases on resonances indicating that nonlinear effects are predominant. For each frequency value, convergence of approximate strain energy is observed. Emergence of third and fifth harmonics is noticed near resonances both on vibratory responses and on approximate strain energy. Parametric studies are carried out by varying the excitation force amplitude and the threshold value of the adaptive algorithm. Maximal amplitudes of vibration and frequency response functions are plotted for three different points of the structure. Nonlinear effects become more predominant for higher force amplitudes and consequently the number of retained harmonics is increased.},

In past works, implementation of intentional geometric nonlinearity to an otherwise linear nano/micromechanical resonator has been successfully achieved by local modification of the system through nonlinear attachments of nanoscale size, such as nanotubes and nanowires. However, the conventional fabrication method involving manual integration of nanoscale components produced a low yield rate in these systems. In the present work, we employed a transfer-printing assembly technique to reliably integrate a silicon nanomembrane as a nonlinear coupling component onto a linear dynamic system with two discrete microcantilevers. The dynamics of the developed system was modeled analytically and investigated experimentally as the coupling strength was finely tuned via FIB post-processing. The transition from the linear to the nonlinear dynamic regime with gradual change in the coupling strength was experimentally studied. In addition, we observed for the weakly coupled system that oscillation was asynchronous in the vicinity of the resonance, thus exhibiting a nonlinear complex mode. We conjectured that the emergence of this nonlinear complex mode could be attributed to the nonlinear damping arising from the attached nanomembrane.},

Later Shaw and Pierre provided a definition for nonconservative systems and defined NNMs as invariant manifolds in phase space. If the system vibrates on such a manifold all other modes shall remain quiescent for all time. Nowadays there are many publications using the concept of NNMs to investigate systems with polynomial nonlinearities. But until now the upper mentioned definition is mostly used to investigate viscously damped systems. In this paper an oscillator containing a geometrically nonlinear (cubic) spring and a dry friction damper is considered. The system is driven into resonance and decay processes are evaluated. Wavelet analysis is used to identify which frequencies and harmonics remain during the decay process. {\copyright} The Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc. 2016.},

It is found that dry friction between the dampers (or between damper and blade) is a very effective means of reducing the vibration of a blade.The resonance frequency, the response amplitude and the relative damping ratio can all be influenced by dry friction. High harmonic waves on the response of the blade which are caused by dry friction are observed in the test. However, the wave response of the damped blade is still basically harmonic. The normal force acting on the rub surfaces of the damped blade will influence the dynamic characteristics of the blade. Since the damped blade system is non-linear due to dry friction, the external exciting force can also influence the dynamic characteristics of the blade.},

The approach is an extension of the nonlinear normal mode (NNM) formulation previously developed by the authors for free oscillations, wherein an auxiliary system that models the excitation is used to augment the equations of motion. In this manner, the excitation is simply treated as an additional system state, yielding a system with an extra degree-of-freedom (dof), whose response is known. A reduced-order model for the forced system is then determined by the usual NNM procedure, and an efficient Galerkin-based solution method is used to numerically construct the attendant invariant manifolds. The technique is illustrated by determining the frequency response for a simple 2-dof mass--spring system with cubic nonlinearities, and for a discretized beam model with 12 dof. The results show that this method provides very accurate responses over a range of frequencies near resonances.},

The effects of the normal preload, shroud contact angle and shroud situation on the friction damping are analyzed from the test results. The results indicate that there is an optimal preload under which the shroud contact can provide optimum performance in dissipating vibratory energy for a given exciting force, and the larger is the relative motion between the interfaces, the more is the dissipating vibratory energy. Some laws that must be obeyed in the design of shroud contact angle and shroud situation are also concluded. The experimental results can be used to verify the theoretical and numerical results.},

An effective method is proposed to predict nonlinear forced response of bladed disks accounting for nonlinear interactions at the blade-disk joints in frequency domain, which syncretizes the excellencies of harmonic balance method, dynamic softness method and tracking motion method. Constraint Mode is introduced to express the relative motion which occurs at the blade-disk joints. Based on this method, the effect of Boundary Conditions on the resonant frequencies and forced response levels under different engine rotational speeds is investigated. Large error in the prediction of forced response levels under low engine rotational speed by using traditional methods is found by comparing. The effect of preload distribution at the blade-disk joints and excitation level on damping is also investigated. Based on the effect of preload on dissipated energy for each contact point, the optimum preload distribution is obtained to provide more damping to the system. With the increasing of the excitation level a part of contact points start slip-stick transforming during the vibration period. This is why the friction damping has essentially nonlinear character.},

The goal of AFC is to mitigate damaging loads and control the aeroelastic response of wind turbine blades. This can be accomplished by sensing changes in turbine operation and activating devices to adjust the sectional lift coefficient and/or local angle of attack. Fifteen AFC devices are introduced, and four are described in more detail. Non-traditional trailing-edge flaps, plasma actuators, vortex generator jets and microtabs are examples of devices that hold promise for wind turbine control. The microtab system is discussed in further detail including recent experimental results demonstrating its effectiveness in a three-dimensional environment. Wind tunnel tests indicated that a nearly constant change in CL over a wide range of angles of attack is possible with microtab control. Using an angle of attack of 5 degrees as a reference, microtabs with a height of 1.5{\%}c were capable of increasing CL by +0.21 (37{\%}) and decreasing CL by -0.23 (-40{\%}). The results are consistent with findings from past two-dimensional experiments and numerical efforts. Through comparisons to other load control studies, the controllable range of this micro-tab system is determined to be suitable for smart blade applications. {\copyright} 2009 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

 abstract = {When using electrodynamic vibration exciters to excite structures, the actual force applied to the structure under test is the reaction force between the exciter and the structure. The magnitude and phase of the reaction force is dependent upon the characteristics of the structure and exciter. Therefore the quality of the reaction force i.e. the force applied on the structure depends on the relationship between the exciter and structure under test. Looking at the signal from the force transducer when exciting a structure with a sine wave, the signal will appear harmonically distorted within the regions of the resonance frequencies. This phenomenon is easily observed when performing tests on lightly damped structures. The harmonic distortion is a result of nonlinearities produced by the shaker when undergoing large amplitude vibrations, at resonances. When dealing with non-linear structures, it is of great importance to be able to keep a constant force level as well as a non-distorted sine wave in order to get reliable results within the regions of the resonance frequencies. This paper presents theoretical methods that can be used to create a non-distorted sinusoidal excitation signal with constant force level.},

@article{Jung.2012,
 abstract = {A novel methodology to detect the presence of a crack and to predict the nonlinear forced response of mistuned turbine engine rotors with a cracked blade and mistuning is developed. The combined effects of the crack and mistuning are modeled. First, a hybrid-interface method based on component mode synthesis is employed to develop reduced-order models (ROMs) of the tuned system with a cracked blade. Constraint modes are added to model the displacements due to the intermittent contact between the crack surfaces. The degrees of freedom (DOFs) on the crack surfaces are retained as active DOFs so that the physical forces due to the contact/interaction (in the three-dimensional space) can be accurately modeled. Next, the presence of mistuning in the tuned system with a cracked blade is modeled. Component mode mistuning is used to account for mistuning present in the uncracked blades while the cracked blade is considered as a reference (with no mistuning). Next, the resulting (reduced-order) nonlinear equations of motion are solved by applying an alternating frequency/time-domain method. Using these efficient ROMs in a forced response analysis, it is found that the new modeling approach provides significant computational cost savings, while ensuring good accuracy relative to full-order finite element analyses. Furthermore, the effects of the cracked blade on the mistuned system are investigated and used to detect statistically the presence of a crack and to identify which blade of a full bladed disk is cracked. In particular, it is shown that cracks can be distinguished from mistuning. {\copyright} VC 2012 by ASME.},

@phdthesis{kahl2002,
 abstract = {A numerical method has been developed to study the effects of structural mistuning

on the aeroelastic behaviour of turbomachinery cascades.

The specific objectives of the work presented here were the following:

• A method was to be developed that can assess the major effects of structural

mistuning in a cascade in sub- and transonic flow situations.

• The influence of mechanical and aerodynamic coupling between the blades

as well as coupling between multiple modes for each blade was to be

included.

• Accurate representations of the aerodynamic forces, taken from a modern

three-dimensional unsteady aerodynamic solver were to be used.

• The method should be applicable for design use, meaning that it has to

supply results quickly for a large number of configurations.

• The applicability and accuracy of the method was to be demonstrated by

comparison of numerical results to available data from recent experiments.

• The influence of major parameters on the aeroelastic stability and on the

resonant amplitude of representative test cases should be assessed.

The approach used to achieve these goals is the combination of a linearised Euler

method for the aerodynamic calculations with a modal reduction technique, where

the structural properties of each blade are represented by only a few eigenmodes.

The method is validated and applied to two test cases, comprising of a transonic

compressor rotor and a high pressure turbine rotor. Both are representative of

modern turbomachinery designs.

The final conclusions of this work are:

• The newly developed method is capable to assess the dominant effects of

structural mistuning in turbomachinery cascades, including the mechanical

and aerodynamic coupling of adjacent blades and the aerodynamic coupling

of multiple modes with arbitrarily complex modeshapes.

• In this method, the aerodynamic characteristics of the cascade are accurately

represented using the generalised unsteady aerodynamic coefficients derived

from a modern three-dimensional flow solver, applicable to and validated for

both sub- and transonic configurations.

• The simplifications employed significantly contribute to the computational

efficiency of the method, making it applicable for design purposes as well as

for the assessment of large parametric variations or for statistical studies of

stochastically mistuned configurations.

• The current method is successfully validated by a comparison of numerical to

experimental data. The applicability and accuracy is demonstrated by the

favourable agreement between measured and computed results.

• Based on these validations, the method is applied to study the influence of

major parameters on the aeroelastic behaviour of the selected test cases. The

results show a wide range of phenomena, dependent on the type and

strength of mistuning, frequency, modeshape and interblade phase angle.

The results highlight the close inter-dependence of the aeroelastic stability

derived from the eigenvalue analysis and the resonant amplitudes derived

from the forced response analysis.





Ein numerisches Verfahren wurde entwickelt, um den Einfluss kleiner

Verstimmungen der strukturellen Eigenschaften von Turbomaschinen -

Beschaufelungen auf deren aeroelastisches Verhalten zu untersuchen.

Die Ziele der hier vorgestellten Arbeiten waren:

• Ein Verfahren war zu entwickeln, welches die wesentlichen Effekte von

struktureller Verstimmung in Beschaufelungen mit sub- und transsonischen

Str{\"o}mungen richtig wiedergibt.

• Der Einfluss mechanischer und aerodynamischer Kopplung zwischen den

Schaufeln sowie der Kopplung zwischen verschiedenen Eigenformen der

Schaufeln sollte ber{\"u}cksichtigt werden.

• Das Verfahrens musste auch bei komplexen dreidimensionalen, sub- und

transsonischen Str{\"o}mungszust{\"a}nden anwendbar sein.

• Das zu entwickelnde Verfahren sollte f{\"u}r den Entwurfsprozess tauglich sein,

also in kurzer Zeit Ergebnisse f{\"u}r eine gro{\ss}e Anzahl verschiedener

Konfigurationen liefern k{\"o}nnen.

• Die Anwendbarkeit und Genauigkeit des neu entwickelten Verfahrens war

durch den Vergleich numerischer Ergebnisse mit experimentellen Resultaten

zu zeigen.

• Der Einfluss der wesentlichen Parameter auf die aeroelastische Stabilit{\"a}t und

auf die Resonanzamplituden unter Zwangserregung sollte an repr{\"a}sentativen

Testf{\"a}llen untersucht werden.

Das zur Erreichung dieser Ziele gew{\"a}hlte Vorgehen besteht in der Kombination

eines zeitlinearisierten Euler-Verfahrens zur instation{\"a}ren Str{\"o}mungsberechnung mit

einem modalen Ansatz, bei dem das strukturelle Verhalten jeder Schaufel durch

wenige Eigenformen wiedergegeben wird.

Das Verfahren wurde auf zwei Testf{\"a}lle angewandt und daran validiert. Dabei

handelt es sich um einen transsonischen Verdichterrotor und den Rotor einer

Hochdruckturbinen - Versuchsturbine. Beide entsprechen in ihrer Auslegung den

Komponenten moderner Turbomaschinen.

Die wesentlichen Ergebnisse der vorliegenden Arbeit sind:

• Das neu entwickelte Verfahren ist in der Lage, die wesentlichen Effekte von

Kopplung und Verstimmung in den Beschaufelungen von Turbomaschinen

richtig zu erfassen, einschlie{\ss}lich der mechanischen Kopplung benachbarter

Schaufeln und der aerodynamischen Kopplung unterschiedlicher Moden.

Dabei bestehen keine Einschr{\"a}nkungen hinsichtlich der Komplexit{\"a}t der

untersuchten Moden.

• Die verwendeten generalisierten Luftkraft-Koeffizienten liefern eine exakte

Beschreibung des instation{\"a}ren Verhaltens der untersuchten

Beschaufelungen. Die Koeffizienten werden mit Hilfe eines modernen

dreidimensionalen Str{\"o}mungsl{\"o}sers ermittelt, der f{\"u}r sub- wie auch

transsonische Str{\"o}mungen anwendbar und validiert ist.

• Die verwendeten Vereinfachungen tragen wesentlich zu der Geschwindigkeit

des entwickelten Verfahrens bei. Dadurch wird einerseits die Anwendbarkeit

im Auslegungsprozess erm{\"o}glicht, andererseits sind dadurch auch

Parametervariationen oder statistische Untersuchungen stochastisch

verstimmter Konfigurationen durchf{\"u}hrbar.

• Das vorgestellte Verfahren ist durch den Vergleich numerischer Ergebnisse

mit experimentellen Daten validiert. Die Anwendbarkeit und Genauigkeit wird

durch die gute {\"U}bereinstimung zwischen Rechnungen und Messungen

best{\"a}tigt.

• Abgesichert durch diese Validierungen wurde das Verfahren f{\"u}r verschiedene

Parametervariationen angewandt, bei denen der Einfluss der wesentlichen

Parameter auf das aeroelastische Verhalten der ausgew{\"a}hlten Testf{\"a}lle

untersucht wurde. Die Ergebnisse lassen eine Vielfalt verschiedener

Ph{\"a}nomene erkennen, die gro{\ss}e Unterschiede in Abh{\"a}ngigkeit von der

St{\"a}rke der Verstimmung, der Frequenz, den Eigenformen und dem

Phasendifferenzwinkel aufweisen. Insbesondere wird an vielen Ergebnissen

das enge Zusammenspiel zwischen der Ver{\"a}nderung der aeroelastischen

Eigenwerte und den Resonanzamplituden unter Zwangserregung deutlich.},

The theory contains a number of new elements, but the elegant existence proofs of the French-Italian school are missing. A start is made by extending the principle of virtual work to normal and frictional contact in such a manner that it needs no longer be known beforehand whether---in the case of normal contact---actual contact is or is not established, or---in the case of frictional contact---slip does or does not occur. Then the principle of minimal potential energy is set up for a non-linear elastic body in contact with a rigid base. Uniqueness and minimality of the solution are proved under certain conditions, the Reissner principle is established, and the principle of minimal complementary energy is derived. Finally the principles are cast in what is termed surface mechanical form, and two examples are given: the variational principle for normal half-space contact problems, and a new principle for time-dependent frictional half-space contact. Upon discretization, these principles provide a quadratic object function to be minimized under linear or quadratic inequality constraints. The positions of the contact area and of the regions of slip and adhesion appear as by-products of the calculation.},

The model is a binary tree of spring-connected masses, with dampers acting on the lowest level. The masses and stiffnesses between levels change according to a power law. The different levels represent different scales, enabling the definition of ``mass wavenumbers.'' The eigenvalue distribution of the model exhibits a devil's staircase self-similarity. The energy spectrum of the model (defined as the energy distribution among the different mass wavenumbers) is derived in the asymptotic limit. A decimation procedure is applied to replace the model with an equivalent chain oscillator.

 abstract = {The interaction between a flexible structure and the surrounding fluid gives rise to a variety of phenomena with applications in many areas, such as, stability analysis of airplane wings, turbomachinery design, design of bridges, and the flow of blood through arteries. Studying these phenomena requires modeling of both fluid and structure. Many approaches in computational aeroelasticity seek to synthesize independent computational approaches for the aerodynamic and the structural dynamic subsystems. This strategy is known to be fraught with complications associated with the interaction between the two simulation modules. The task is to choosing the appropriate models for fluid and structure based on the application, and to develop an efficient interface to couple the two models. In the present article, we review the recent advancements in the field of fluid-structure interaction, with specific attention to aeroelastic applications. One of the key aspects to developing a robust coupled aeroelastic model is the presence of an efficient moving grid technique to account for structural deformations. Several such techniques are reviewed in this paper. Also, the time scales associated with fluid-structure interaction problems can be very different; hence, appropriate time stepping strategies and/or sub-cycling procedures within the individual field need to be devised.

Part 2 deals with the estimation of damping. During the design

process of turbomachinery components, mechanical integrity has

to be guaranteed with respect to high cycle fatigue of blades subject

to forced response or flutter. This requires the determination

of stress levels within the blade which in turn depend on the

forcing function and damping. The vast majority of experimental

research in this field has been performed on axial configurations

for both compressors and turbines. This experimental study aims

to gain insight into forced response vibration at resonance for a

radial compressor. For this purpose a research impeller was instrumented

with dynamic strain gauges and operated under resonant

conditions. Modal properties were analysed using FEM

and verified using an optical method termed Electronic-Speckle-

Pattern-Correlation-Interferometry (ESPI).



During the experiment, unsteady forces acting on the blades

were generated by grid installations upstream of the impeller

which created a distorted inlet flow pattern. The associated flow

properties were measured using an aerodynamic probe. The resultant

pressure fluctuations on the blade surface and the corresponding

frequency content were assessed using unsteady CFD.

The response of the blades was measured for three resonant

crossings which could be distinguished by the excitation order

and the natural frequency of the blades. Measurements were undertaken

for a number of inlet pressure settings starting at near

vacuum and then increasing. The overall results showed that the

installed distortion screens generated harmonics in addition to

the fundamental frequency. The resonant response of the first and

second blade mode showed that the underlying dynamics support

a single-degree-of-freedom model.},

 abstract = {Forming the second part of a two-part paper, the estimation

of damping is presented here. Part 1 discusses the experimental

approach and the results on blade resonant response measurements.

In the study of forced response damping is a crucial parameter

which is measured to quantify the ability of a vibrating

system to dissipate vibratory energy in response to a given

excitation source. The blading of turbomachinery components

is particularly prone to forced response excitation which is one

of the major causes of high cycle fatigue failure during operation.

In turbocharging applications forced response can not be

avoided due to a number of factors, i.e. change in speed, inlet

bends or obstructions in the flow field. This study aims to quantify

the damping parameter for the lightly damped blades of a

centrifugal compressor. The impeller geometry is typical of turbocharging

applications. As a first step the non-rotating impeller

was excited using piezos and the transfer function was derived

for a number of pressure settings. Both circle-fit and a curve-fit

procedure were used to derive material damping. In the second

step, measurements were taken in the test facility where forced

response conditions were generated using distortion screens upstream

of the impeller. Main blade strain response was measured

by sweeping through a number of resonant points. A curve-fit

procedure was applied to estimate the critical damping ratio. The

contribution of material and aerodynamic damping was derived

from a linear curve fit applied to damping data as a function of

inlet pressure. Overall, it will be shown that aerodynamic damping

dominates the dissipation process for applications with inlet

pressure of 1 bar. Damping was found to depend on the throttle

setting of the compressor and where applicable CFD results were

used to point towards possible causes of this effect.},

 abstract = {Experimental--analytical substructuring is attractive when there is motivation to replace one or more system subcomponents with an experimental model. This experimentally derived substructure can then be coupled to finite element models of the rest of the structure to predict the system response. The transmission simulator method couples a fixture to the component of interest during a vibration test in order to improve the experimental model for the component. The transmission simulator is then subtracted from the tested system to produce the experimental component. The method reduces ill-conditioning by imposing a least squares fit of constraints between substructure modal coordinates to connect substructures, instead of directly connecting physical interface degrees of freedom. This paper presents an alternative means of deriving the experimental substructure model, in which a Craig--Bampton representation of the transmission simulator is created and subtracted from the experimental measurements. The corresponding modal basis of the transmission simulator is described by the fixed-interface modes, rather than free modes that were used in the original approach. These modes do a better job of representing the shape of the transmission simulator as it responds within the experimental system, leading to more accurate results using fewer modes. The new approach is demonstrated using a simple finite element model based example with a redundant interface.},

 abstract = {Blade manufacturing tolerance and wear in operation may induce mistuning, and mistuning will lead to vibration localization which will result in destruction of bladed disk. Generally, intentional mistuning has been widely investigated to control the maximum forced response. On the other hand, it should be noted that the bladed disk with high rotational speed is obviously subjected to the Coriolis force. However, the Coriolis force is not included in intentionally mistuned bladed disk in previous studies. Therefore, this paper is to study the effect of the Coriolis force on forced response magnification of intentionally mistuned bladed disk. Finite element method is used to calculate the harmonic response of the intentionally mistuned bladed disk with and without the Coriolis force. The effects of intentional mistuning strength and different integer harmonic order on the response magnification factor with the Coriolis force are discussed. It should be pointed out that, when the integer harmonic order is 1, 3 and 5, the response magnification factor with the effect of the Coriolis force increase by 3.9{\%}, 3.53{\%} and 3.76{\%} respectively compared to the system of non-Coriolis force. In addition, forced response magnification factor of intentionally mistuned bladed disk with and without the Coriolis force under different rotational speed is researched in contrast. It shows that, when the rotational speed is 3000. rpm, the response magnification factor with the Coriolis force increases by 0.65{\%} compared to the system of non-Coriolis force, while the response magnification factor with the Coriolis force decreases by 6.28{\%} compared to the system of non-Coriolis force when the rotational speed is 12000. rpm. {\copyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd.},

 abstract = {An analytical model of annular-flow-induced vibration of a pinned--pinned cylinder is proposed. The model is based on three main assumptions: (i) small perturbations in flow components, (ii) negligible radial flow to reduce the annular flow to two-dimensional flow, and axial flow only for reduction to a one-dimensional flow, and (iii) perturbation frictional loss depending on the variation of axial perturbation velocity in terms of space and time. In this study, it is concluded that (a) the difference in fluidelastic forces between two- and one-dimensional flow models mostly depends on cylinder radius, and on whether perturbation flow is mainly allowed in the axial or circumferential direction, (b) the one-dimensional flow model should be limited to 1-d.o.f. vibration analysis or the case of a cylinder having a large radius-to-length ratio, and (c) the perturbation assumption has little effect on the dynamics of annular-flow-induced vibrations; however, the critical flow velocity is diminished considerably. Finally, preliminary results suggest that fluid friction may significantly modify the predicted model dynamics.},

 abstract = {Although the identification and analysis of structures with a localized nonlinearity, either weak or strong, is within reach, identification of multiple nonlinearities coexisting at different locations is still a challenge, especially if these nonlinearities are strong. In such cases, identifying each nonlinearity separately requires a tedious work or may not be possible at all in some cases. In this paper, an approach for experimental modal analysis of nonlinear systems by using Response-Controlled stepped-sine Testing (RCT) is proposed. The proposed approach is applicable to systems with several nonlinearities at various different locations, provided that modes are well separated and no internal resonances occur. Step-sine testing carried out by keeping the displacement amplitude of the driving point constant yields quasi-linear frequency response functions directly, from which the modal parameters can be identified as functions of modal amplitude of the mode of concern, by employing standard linear modal analysis tools. These identified modal parameters can then be used in calculating near-resonant frequency response curves, including the unstable branch if there is any, for various untested harmonic forcing cases. The proposed RCT approach makes it also possible to extract nonlinear normal modes experimentally without using sophisticated control algorithms, directly from the identified modal constants, and also to obtain near-resonant frequency response curves experimentally for untested constant-amplitude harmonic forcing cases by extracting isocurves of constant-amplitude forcing from the measured Harmonic Force Surface (HFS), a new concept proposed in this paper. The key feature of the HFS is its ability to extract unstable branches together with turning points of constant-force frequency response curves directly from experiment, accurately. The method is validated with numerical and experimental case studies. The numerical example consists of a 5 DOF lumped system with strong several conservative nonlinear elements. Experimental case studies consist of a cantilever beam supported at its free-end by two metal strips which create strong stiffening nonlinearity, and a real missile structure which exhibit moderate damping nonlinearity mostly due to several bolted joints on the structure.},

 abstract = {This work proposes two novel aspects for modal substructuring of geometrical nonlinear structural dynamics. Firstly, we present a non-intrusive model order reduction technique for substructures using an augmented free-interface method with residual flexibility attachment modes. Non-intrusive model reduction methods are beneficial, because they do not require to access substructures' closed form equations of motion while building nonlinear reduced models. Therefore, they can be easily combined with commercial finite element packages. Generally, the interface of substructures can contain many degrees-of-freedom leading to reduced order models, which are still computationally expensive. As a second novel point, the nonlinear reduced models of substructures are developed when the augmented free-interface-based method is combined with three interface reduction techniques (one system-level and two local-level), which so far have only been used with the fixed-interface method of Hurty/Craig-Bampton. The proposed methods are compared in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency with the two existing non-intrusive-based modal substructuring methods: nonlinear free-interface and nonlinear Hurty/Craig-Bampton methods. The performance of the improved free-interface method is examined on two different geometrically nonlinear structures by applying random pressure on them and comparing displacement spectral densities. The dynamic results show a remarkable improvement of accuracy compared to the nonlinear free-interface method and a slightly improved accuracy compared to the nonlinear Hurty/Craig-Bampton method. This improvement is achieved while the online computational costs are not increased significantly.},

To achieve higher capacity, wind turbines have increased in their size over the years. However, the large size of the modern turbines has exacerbated the problem of vibrations, which results in lower efficiency and power generation. Because of the large deformations, the conventional linear theories cannot model the blades accurately, due to the importance of nonlinear effects in large scale wind turbines. In this research, a nonlinear kinematic model of the wind turbine blade is developed using the Hamilton's principle. This model is then simplified to three modal equations, two in flapwise direction and one in edgewise direction. These equations are then solved analytically using the multiple scales perturbation method, under the free vibration conditions including the non-resonance and internal resonance cases. In the non-resonance case, the accuracy of the perturbation method is compared with the numerical solutions. In the internal resonance case, the phenomenon of energy transfer between the modes is shown in three different conditions.},

This extension allows for the computation of branches of periodic solutions of a broader class of nonlinear dynamical systems.

The principle remains to transform the original ODE system into an extended polynomial quadratic system for an easy application of the harmonic balance method (HBM). The transformation of non-polynomial terms is based on the differentiation of state variables with respect to the time variable, shifting the nonlinear non-polynomial nonlinearity to a time-independent initial condition equation, not concerned with the HBM. The continuation of the resulting algebraic system is here performed by the asymptotic numerical method (high order Taylor series representation of the solution branch) using a further differentiation of the non-polynomial algebraic equation with respect to the path parameter.

A one dof vibro-impact system is used to illustrate how an exponential nonlinearity is handled, showing that the method works at very high order, 1000 in that case. Various kinds of nonlinear functions are also treated, and finally the nonlinear free pendulum is addressed, showing that very accurate periodic solutions can be computed with the proposed method.},

mistuning on forced response, however, may be either beneficial or adverse, depending on the engine order of

the forcing function. Additionally, the results illustrate that it may be feasible to utilize mistuning as a passive

active control method using a piezo-electric device was

proposed and studied in the numerical analysis with a

developed flow-structure coupled code. In the control

method, the trailing edge of a blade was actively

the blade. Numerical analysis was carried out in

transonic flow where the instability of blade vibration

From the results, it was found that the unstable

vibration of the blades could effectively be suppressed

if the phase difference between the blade vibration and

the active trailing edge oscillation was properly

selected. The suppression effect was caused by

alteration of the shock oscillation behavior, which was

induced by the active oscillation of the trailing edge.

However, a major concern for structural dynamicists is that its validity is limited to linear structures. New developments have been proposed in order to examine nonlinear systems, among which the theory based on nonlinear normal modes is indubitably the most appealing. In this paper, a different approach is adopted, and proper orthogonal decomposition is considered. The modes extracted from the decomposition may serve two purposes, namely order reduction by projecting high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space and feature extraction by revealing relevant but unexpected structure hidden in the data. The utility of the method for dynamic characterization and order reduction of linear and nonlinear mechanical systems is demonstrated in this study.},

 abstract = {In nonlinear systems the resonance frequency depends on the energy in the system. This change in resonance frequency contains valuable information about the systems behavior and the nonlinear normal modes (NNMs) associated with each point of the backbone curve. This information can e.g. be used for system identification. However, the accurate and efficient measurement of the backbone curve in nonlinear systems is still challenging. This contribution proposes a new method to measure the backbone curve which is based on the control concept of a Phase-Locked-Loop (PLL) which is well known in electronics applications. A properly designed PLL is capable of finding linear resonances but it can also be used for the tracking of energy dependent backbone curves. The new method provides very accurate results by using steady state responses in the nonlinear mode. In contrast to commonly used free decay measurements this approach eliminates transient effects. Yet, it is also very efficient and user friendly as an automated testing can be performed. The method is experimentally demonstrated on a beam structure with cubic nonlinearity. Furthermore the capability of tracking through internal resonant NNMs will be examined and new possibilities for quantitative measurements of these effects will be discussed.},

Hurty/Craig-Bampton substructuring and interface reduction techniques are commonly utilized to reduce computation time for jointed structures. In the past, these methods have only been applied to substructures rigidly attached to one another, resulting in a linear model.

 abstract = {A computational method for performing aeroelastic analysis using either a time-linearized or an unsteady time-accurate solver for the compressible Reynolds averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) equations is described. The time-linearized solver employs the assumption of small time-harmonic perturbations and is implemented via finite differences of the nonlinear flux routines of the time-accurate solver. The resulting linear system is solved using a parallelized generalized minimal residual (GMRES) method with block-local preconditioning. The time accurate solver uses a dual time stepping algorithm for the solution of the unsteady RANS equations on a periodically moving computational grid. For either solver, and both flutter and forced response problems, a mapping algorithm has been developed to map structural eigenmodes, obtained from finite element structural analysis, from the surface mesh of the finite element structural solver to the surface mesh of the finite volume flow solver. Using the surface displacement data an elliptic mesh deformation algorithm, based on linear elasticity theory, is then used to compute the grid deformation vector field. The developed methods are validated first using standard configuration 10. Finally, for an ultra-high bypass ratio fan, the results of the time-linearized and the unsteady module are compared.

 abstract = {Typical turboprop noise spectra exhibit a series of characteristic peaks which are directly related to the product of propeller rpm and number of propeller blades. These blade passage frequencies contribute significantly to the overall sound pressure level both outside and inside the aircraft. Their contribution to cabin noise is usually reduced by appropriately adjusted mass dampers. However, since the engine rpm varies for different flight stages, any fixed eigenfrequency absorber will merely be a sub-optimal compromise. The Tunable Vibration Absorber (TVA) introduced in this article has a variable resonant frequency which enables an adaptation to different flight phases providing largely improved performance. Frequency tuning is achieved through a piezo-electric stack actuator, which applies a pressure force to a pair of leaf springs thus reducing their effective bending stiffness. Among the main advantages of this particular approach are a static control signal and low power consumption. To enable a light-weight construction the components which generate the pressure loading are incorporated into the oscillating mass. The TVA allows to cover a wide frequency range using only a single device. Additionally, it features damping control capability and optional active multi-mode operation. Structural-acoustic simulations have indicated a noise reduction potential of approximately 10 dB. This article gives a short overview of different tuneable vibration absorber concepts, lines out the theoretical background of the proposed approach, discusses the general components layout and describes the experimental verification of a prototype TVA for the Airbus A400M. {\copyright} 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS.

It is shown that blade mistuning strongly affects the interaction between flexible bladed disk (on rigid shaft) and rigid bladed disk (on flexible shaft) modes. This interaction affects the flexible bladed disk modes with all possible nodal diameters, and it is not restricted to the modes with one nodal diameter, as observed for the tuned bladed disks, supported by a flexible shaft.

 abstract = {In this study, a new nonlinear finite element model is presented in the frame work of Carrera's Unified Formulation (CUF) for the dynamic analysis of SMA hybrid composite considering the instantaneous phase transformation and material nonlinearity effects, for every point on the plate. The CUF unify many theories in a unified form which can be differed by the order of expansion and definition of the variables in the thickness direction. The Brinson's SMA constitutive equation is used to model the behavior of SMA wires. The governing equations are derived using the Reissner Mixed Variational Theorem (RMVT) in order to enforce the interlaminar continuity of transverse shear and normal stresses between two adjacent layers. A transient finite-element-based method beside an iterative incremental procedure is presented to study the dynamic response of multilayered composite plate embedded with SMA wires. A suppressed vibration of the plate is observed, which is due to the energy dissipation of SMA wires. The parametric effects like length-to-thickness ratio, plate aspect ratio and also the effect of different boundary conditions, upon the loss factors are investigated. Results show that as the length-to-thickness ratio and also the plate aspect ratio increases, the loss factor decreases. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

 abstract = {The behaviour of a system containing a mass traveling on a cantilever beam is considered. The mass is induced to move by an applied force as opposed to the case which has been considered in most literature where the position of the moving mass is assumed to be known and independent of the motion of the beam. Furthermore, the system to be discussed has the unique characteristic that the motions of the mass and the beam are coupled. The mathematical model of the system includes two coupled nonlinear integral/partial differential equations which are impossible to solve analytically and are difficult to solve numerically in their original form. As a remedy, the solution is discretized into space and time functions and the equations of motion are reduced to a set of ordinary differential equations. The shape function is chosen so that it satisfies the boundary conditions of the beam as well as the transient conditions imposed by the traveling mass. This choice of the shape function, which considers the mass-beam interaction, provides an improvement over the conventional method of using a simple cantilever beam mode shapes.



The ordinary differential equations of motion using the `improved' shaped functions, are solved numerically to obtain the dynamic behaviour of the system. The results illustrate the validity of the model, and demonstrate the advantages of the `improved' model to the `un-improved' equations.},

accurate model of a bladed disk containing cracked blade. This

model allows simulation of bladed disk dynamic behavior for

various crack positions and lengths. Due to absence of cyclic

symmetry caused by crack presence in the disk, a reduction

procedure was implemented to simulate full bladed disk. It is

proposed to use crack location as an interface between two substructures

for subsequent fixed-interface method application.

Harmonic balance method was applied to take into account

crack nonlinear behavior under periodically varying loads. The

method implementation considers contact interaction between

crack sides at the crack being closed. The contact force is

calculated using penalty method of contact force calculation.

Relative vertical displacements between nodes in contact were

used as nonlinear degrees of freedom (DOFs).

Developed bladed disk model is able to take into account

external excitation forces phase lag caused by difference

between number of rotor and stator blades. Also presence of

mistuning was considered. It was shown that certain level of

mistuning can directly affect cracked blade detectability.

Cracked blade dynamic behavior localization plays here very

important role. Absence of cracked blade localization results in

impossibility to separate cracked blade response at any

Numerical results were obtained for a set of 20 different twisted plates having various aspect ratios, thickness ratios and pretwist angles. Nineteen distinct theoretical methods were employed, 15 using finite elements, two using shell theory, and two using beam theory. Although some of the best-known computational procedures (especially finite element codes) were used by analysts with great experience, the numerical results obtained showed considerable disagreement.

Failure of the dampers to perform as expected showed the need to gain a better understanding of the physical mechanism of friction dampers. Over the last 10 years research on friction dampers for aeronautical propulsion systems has resulted in methods to optimize damper designs. The first-stage turbine blades on the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) high-pressure oxygen pump have experienced cracking problems due to excessive vibration. A solution is to incorporate a well-designed friction dampers to attenuate blade vibration. The subject study, a cooperative effort between NASA Lewis and Carnegie-Mellon University, represents an application of recently developed friction damper technology to the SSME high-pressure oxygen turbopump. The major emphasis was the contractor's design known as the two-piece damper. Damping occurs at the frictional interface between the top half of the damper and the underside of the platforms of the adjacent blades. The lower half of the damper is an air seal to retard airflow in the volume between blade necks.},

This paper presents the results of a unique experimental method and data analysis study of multiple damping sources seen in actual turbine components operating at engine conditions. The contributions of both aerodynamic and structural damping for several different blade vibration modes, including bending and torsion, were determined. Results of the experiments indicated that aerodynamic damping was a large component of the total damping for all modes. A study of structural damping as a function of rotational speed was also included to show the effect of friction damping at the blade and disk attachment interface. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the present paper is the first report of independent and simultaneous structural and aerodynamic damping measurement under engine-level rotational speeds.},

However, many low pressure turbine (LPT) blade designs include a tip shroud that mechanically connects the blades together in a structure exhibiting cyclic symmetry. A proper vibration analysis produces a frequency and complex mode shape that represents two real modes phase shifted by 90 deg. This paper describes an extension to the current design method to consider these complex mode shapes. As in the current method, baseline unsteady aerodynamic analyses must be performed for the three fundamental motions, two translations and a rotation. Unlike the current method work matrices must be saved for a range of reduced frequencies and interblade phase angles. These work matrices are used to generate the total work for the complex mode shape. Since it still only requires knowledge of the reduced frequency and mode shape (complex), this new method is still very quick and easy to use. Theory and an example application are presented.},

In this paper,we consider the nonlinear dynamic coupling of a piezoelectricclamped-clamped beam with sliding mass and study experimentally and numerically how these nonlinear interactions affect theperformance of the energy harvester. We derive the mathematical model using the extended Hamilton principle. The governing equations of motion are obtained as three coupled nonlinearpartial differential equations. The Galerkin method is employedto obtain a reduced order model. Our mathematical formulation is validated via experiments and the results show very goodagreement between the simulation and the experiment. Parametric studies are carried out to examine how key parameters affectthe performance of the energy harvester.

The method utilizes thehypertimeconcept, which isolates each frequency component of a response into pseudo-time domains. Explicit Jacobians are derived to obtain stable convergence solutions in the iteration process. The frequency components of the non-linear restoring force part are analytically expressed from those of the displacement part, using the Galerkin technique to guarantee a convergent solution. As the method utilizes general and systematic computational procedures, it can be applied to analyze the multi-tone or combination-tone responses for higher-dimensional non-linear systems such as multi-disk rotors or automotive drivelines with multiple excitational inputs. To demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method, various simulation results are studied and the results of multiple HBM are compared with those from numerical integration.},

Examples include systems with clearances, backlash, friction, and impulses. Asymptotic methods require smooth (differentiable) flow and are therefore ill-suited for analyzing non-smooth systems. In these cases, the traditional harmonic balance method may be used to obtain approximate periodic solutions, but the method suffers from extremely slow convergence in general. Generalizations of the traditional harmonic balance method are introduced in this paper that result in superior convergence rates and superior modes of convergence. These improvements derive from the introduction of one or more expansion functions that possesses the same degree of continuity as the exact solution. In particular, forming an infinite series of such functions results in an expansion in the same function space of the exact solution. This expansion converges pointwise to the exact solution and to all derivatives thereof. These improvements are illustrated by example upon re-evaluating a classical single degree-of-freedom model for friction-induced vibration.},

Three semi-analytical methods, namely the Describing Function Method, Multi-term Harmonic Balance Method and Stochastic Linearization Method, are utilized to investigate the effect of impact damping. Feasibility of such methods is confirmed by comparing predictions with results yielded by a numerical method. The differences between impact damping and linear viscous damping mechanism are studied in terms of frequency responses, time histories, and the minimum number of harmonics required to simulate the behavior given sinusoidal excitations.

Unlike previous analytical and numerical methods, the proposed HBM includes adaptive arc-length continuation and stability calculation capabilities to find periodic solutions in multi-valued nonlinear frequency response regimes as well as to improve convergence. Essential steps of the proposed HBM calculations are introduced, and it is validated by comparing time and frequency domain predictions with those yielded by numerical solutions, experimental studies, or analog simulations for several examples.

In a canonical framework, internal resonance conditions are immediately recognized by identifying commensurable linearized natural frequencies of these systems. Additionally, a canonical formulation allows for a single (linearized modal) coordinate to parameterize all other coordinates during a resonant NNM response. Energy-based NNM methodologies are applied to a canonical set of equations and asymptotic solutions are sought. In order to account for the resonant modal interactions, it will be shown that high-order terms in the O(1) solutions must be considered (in the absence of internal resonances, a linear expansion at O(1) is sufficient). Two applications (`3:1' resonances in a two-degree-of-freedom system and `3:1' resonance in a hinged-clamped beam) are then considered by which to demonstrate the resonant NNM methodology. It is shown that for some responses, nonlinear modal relations do not exist in the context of physical coordinates and thus a transformation to a canonical framework is necessary in order to appropriately define NNM relations.},

The governing nonlinear partial differential equations are discretized by a Galerkin procedure and the resulting set of coupled ordinary differential equations is solved using an asymptotic analysis. The unforced assembly is known to possess localized nonlinear normal modes, which give rise to a very complicated topological structure of fundamental and subharmonic response curves. In contrast to the linear system which exhibits as many forced resonances as its number of degrees of freedom, the nonlinear system is found to possess a number of additional resonance branches which have no counterparts in linear theory. Some of the additional resonances are spatially localized, corresponding to motions of only a small subset of periodic elements. The analytical results are verified by numerical Poincar{\'e} maps, and the forced localization features of the nonlinear assembly are demonstrated by considering its response to impulsive excitations.},

In this paper, we prove this result for 'complete' contact problems in the discrete formulation (i) for systems with no coupling between relative tangential displacements at the interface and the corresponding normal contact tractions and (ii) for certain two-dimensional problems in which the friction coefficient at each node is less than a certain critical value.

SUMMARY



Aiming at more environmentally-friendly, more efficient and more powerful aero engines, integrated

blade disk assemblies (blisks) will become more significant in the future development

of aero engines.

Compared to conventional bladed disk assemblies, the integrated design instead of heavy bladedisk

connection of modern aero engine compressors results in reduced rotor masses, facilitates

higher maximum rotational velocities and improved pressure ratios (increased efficiency factors).

Apart from these advantages a number of disadvantages occur. Some of them are for example

a very low structural damping and a higher sensitivity to manufacturing- and material tolerances

(mistuning).

This results in localized vibration modes, higher displacement amplitudes, critical stress levels

and reduced high cycle fatigue (HCF) of several blades due to inauspicious aerodynamic excitations.

From this, an optimum choice of blades to be instrumented with strain gauges (s/g) is the basis

of a convincing vibration monitoring system during rig tests.

Based on experimental and numerical investigations an overview of the vibration behaviour of

tuned and of mistuned blisks in particular will be presented detailly in this work.

The basic principles of blisk vibrations are shown using updated full finite element models of

different rotor stages from a research high pressure compressor (HPC).

Based on the vibrational behaviour of the tuned, ideal design model the characteristics of the

mistuned system will be explained first, followed by the properties of forced response of the tuned

and mistuned blisk. In this context new criteria for a simple evaluation of localized vibration

modes will be introduced and illustrated in detail by comparison of different real blisk stages.

The investigations show, that different levels of mode-localization and blade displacement magnifications

occur, depending on the blisk geometry and boundary conditions (blade mode, engine

order excitation, damping, etc.). Especially the blade-to-disk-ratio and the blade mode are

dominating factors: Torsional modes, blisks with an inauspiciously related disk stiffness, low

engine order excitations and blade modes with a high number of nodal diameters respectively

have a higher mistuning sensitivity than blade bending modes or blisks with favourable related

disk stiffness.

Complementary to the influence of manufacturing-caused blade mistuning on rotor balance, the

effects of s/g-application on blades will be discussed regarding the modification of the blisk vibration

behaviour.},

Based on an extensive measurement campaign and numerical

effects (blisc milling, rotor tip grinding, welding the single

bliscs together, compressor assembly) and also the strain

gauge application itself on the vibration behavior of real

mistuned bliscs will be presented for a multi-stage high

pressure research compressor (HPC) in detail (see Fig. 1).

The investigations show, that the original blade mistuning

deviations resulting from the initial blisc milling procedure

remain until the last manufacturing process of the aero engine

and still dominate the blisc forced response behavior

during aerodynamic excitation. In contrast to this effect, rotor

tip grinding procedures as well as the assembly of the

rotor drum only cause an even frequency shift of every

blade, which does not significantly change the blisc behavior.

Complementary to the influence of manufacturing-caused

blade mistuning on the whole rotor balance, the effects of

an application of high-temperature strain gauges on HPCblades

will be discussed regarding the modification of the

blisc vibration modes.

Finally different methods will be introduced aiming at a

compensation of the strain gauge induced blade stiffening

depending on the blade dimensions to ensure the best possible

vibration monitoring results.},

the different methods in a general framework that outlines the relations between them. In this paper, a certain vision

on substructuring methods is proposed, by recalling important historical milestones that allow us to understand

substructuring as a domain decomposition concept. Thereafter, based on the dual and primal assembly of

substructures, a general framework for the classification of the methods is presented. This framework allows us to

indicate how the various classes of methods, proposed along the years, can be derived from a clear mathematical

 abstract = {Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov (JFNK) methods are synergistic combinations of Newton-type methods for superlinearly convergent solution of nonlinear equations and Krylov subspace methods for solving the Newton correction equations. The link between the two methods is the Jacobian-vector product, which may be probed approximately without forming and storing the elements of the true Jacobian, through a variety of means, Various approximations to the Jacobian matrix may still be required for preconditioning the resulting Krylov iteration. As with Krylov methods for linear problems, successful application of the JFNK method to any given problem is dependent on adequate preconditioning. JFNK has potential for application throughout problems governed by nonlinear partial differential equations and integro-differential equations. In this survey paper, we place JFNK in context with other nonlinear solution algorithms for both boundary value problems (BVPs) and initial value problems (IVPs). We provide an overview of the mechanics of JFNK and attempt to illustrate the wide variety of preconditioning options available. It is emphasized that JFNK can be wrapped (as an accelerator) around another nonlinear fixed point method (interpreted as a preconditioning process, potentially with significant code reuse). The aim of this paper is not to trace fully the evolution of JFNK, nor to provide proofs of accuracy or optimal convergence for all of the constituent methods, but rather to present the reader with a perspective on how JFNK may be applicable to applications of interest and to provide sources of further practical information. {\copyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Five resonance crossings excited by the stator in a radial inflow turbocharger turbine are investigated and the aerodynamic excitation and damping are predicted using this approach. Blade vibration amplitudes are obtained from a subsequent forced response analysis combining the aerodynamic excitation with aerodynamic damping and a detailed structural model of the investigated turbine rotor.

This study focuses on the accurate prediction of the forced response of tuned bladed disks subject to friction joints. In order to account for extended friction interfaces, the contact area is discretized into several contact points. Microslip behavior is explicitly enforced by a non-uniform normal pressure distribution. Local elastic properties of the contact area are accurately captured in the reduced order model of the structure by employing a component mode synthesis method. The steady-state forced response is efficiently computed using a Multi-Harmonic Balance ansatz. Thus, it is possible to study and explain the occurrence of internal resonances.

The recently developed generalized Fourier--Galerkin method is complemented by a numerical continuation with respect to the kinetic energy, which extends the framework to the investigation of modal interactions resulting in folds of the nonlinear modes. In order to enhance the practicability regarding the investigation of complex large-scale systems, it is proposed to provide analytical gradients and exploit sparsity of the nonlinear part of the governing algebraic equations.

A novel reduced order model (ROM) is developed for those regimes where internal resonances are absent. The approach allows for an accurate approximation of the multi-harmonic content of the resonant mode and accounts for the contributions of the off-resonant modes in their linearized forms. The ROM facilitates the efficient analysis of self-excited limit cycle oscillations, frequency response functions and the direct tracing of forced resonances. The ROM is equipped with a large parameter space including parameters associated with linear damping and near-resonant harmonic forcing terms. An important objective of this paper is to demonstrate the broad applicability of the proposed overall methodology. This is achieved by selected numerical examples including finite element models of structures with strongly nonlinear, non-conservative contact constraints.},

A novel method for the numerical prediction of the slowly varying dynamics of nonlinear mechanical systems has been developed. The method is restricted to the regime of an isolated nonlinear mode and consists of a two-step procedure: In the first step, a multiharmonic analysis of the autonomous system is performed to directly compute the amplitude-dependent characteristics of the considered nonlinear mode. In the second step, these modal properties are used to construct a two-dimensional reduced order model (ROM) that facilitates the efficient computation of steady-state and unsteady dynamics provided that nonlinear modal interactions are absent.

The proposed methodology is applied to several nonlinear mechanical systems ranging form single degree-of-freedom to Finite Element models. Unsteady vibration phenomena such as approaching behavior towards an equilibrium point or limit cycles, and resonance passages are studied regarding the effect of various nonlinearities such as cubic springs, unilateral contact and friction. It is found that the proposed ROM facilitates very fast and accurate analysis of the slow dynamics of nonlinear systems. Moreover, the ROM concept offers a huge parameter space including additional linear damping, stiffness and near-resonant forcing.},

 abstract = {A mechanical system consisting of an elastic beam under harmonic excitation and an attached sliding body is investigated. Recent experimental observations suggest that the system passively (self-)adapts the axial location of the slider to achieve and maintain a condition of self-resonance, which could be useful in applications such as energy harvesting. The purpose of this work is to provide a theoretical explanation of this phenomenon based on an appropriate model. A key feature of the proposed model is a small clearance between the slider and the beam. This clearance gives rise to backlash and frictional contact interactions, both of which are found to be essential for the self-adaptive behavior. Contact is modeled in terms of the Coulomb and Signorini laws, together with the Newton impact law. The set-valued character of the contact laws is accounted for in a measure differential inclusion formulation. Numerical integration is carried out using Moreau's time-stepping scheme. The proposed model reproduces qualitatively most experimental observations. However, although the system showed a distinct self-adaptive character, the behavior was found to be non-resonant for the considered set of parameters. Beside estimating the relationship between resonance frequency and slider location, the model permits predicting the operating limits with regard to excitation level and frequency. Finally, some specific dynamical phenomena such as hysteresis effects and transient resonance captures underline the rich dynamical behavior of the system.},

The method is based on the concept of nonlinear modes. The definition of nonlinear modes is here adjusted in such a way that the modes reflect periodic vibration behavior in the presence of isolated resonances. From a given model of the structure and the nonlinear constitutive law describing the joint interactions, the method extracts amplitude-dependent vibrational features such as natural frequencies, damping ratios, and vibrational deflection shapes. Based on these modal characteristics, a reduced order model is then constructed that facilitates the efficient vibration prediction in a wide range of operating conditions and parameters. Special attention is paid to the aspect of computational efficiency, as well as the compatibility with conventional analysis procedures involving finite element codes. Hence, the methodology is considered particularly useful for the state-of-the-art design process of jointed structures, possibly involving reliability analysis to account for uncertainty.},

 abstract = {Under certain conditions, the dynamics of a nonlinear mechanical system can be represented by a single nonlinear modal oscillator. This holds, in particular, under external excitation near primary resonance or under self-excitation by negative damping of the respective mode. The properties of the modal oscillator can be determined by computational or experimental nonlinear modal analysis. The simplification to a single-nonlinear-mode model facilitates qualitative and global analysis, and substantially reduces the computational effort required for probabilistic methods and design optimization. Important limitations of this theory are that only purely mechanical systems can be analyzed and that the respective nonlinear mode has to be recomputed when the system's structural properties are varied. With the theoretical extension proposed in this work, it becomes feasible to attach linear subsystems to the primary mechanical system, and to approximate the dynamics of this coupled system using only the nonlinear mode of the primary mechanical system. The attachments must be described by linear ordinary or differential-algebraic equations with time-invariant coefficient matrices. The attachments do not need to be of purely mechanical nature, but may contain, for instance, electric, magnetic, acoustic, thermal or aerodynamic models. This considerably extends the range of utility of nonlinear modes to applications as diverse as model updating or vibration energy harvesting. As long as the attachments do not significantly deteriorate the host system's modal deflection shape, it is shown that their effect can be reduced to a complex-valued modal impedance and an imposed modal forcing term. In the present work, the proposed approach is computationally assessed for the analysis of exciter-structure interaction. More specifically, the force drop typically encountered in frequency response testing is revisited. A cantilevered beam with cubic spring and an attached electro-dynamical shaker serves as benchmark. The proposed approach shows excellent accuracy. Mainly the already known limitations of single-nonlinear-mode theory reappear. In particular, higher harmonics should not be too pronounced. In the transient case, the time scales of vibration and amplitude-phase modulation should be well separated, and the attachment dynamics should be in quasi-steady state.},

 abstract = {We present a new dissipative and contact-stabilized time discretization scheme for dynamic frictional contact problems, which is based on Rothe's method. Especially for the case of Coulomb friction the stability of the contact stresses is of crucial importance as they directly influence the frictional behavior. In our approach, we obtain an accurate description of the frictional stresses by a time-discretized friction law allowing for an implicit treatment of the contact forces in the framework of the Newmark scheme. Moreover, undesirable oscillations at the contact interface are removed by employing an additional L2-projection within the predictor step. Since the implicit treatment of the material behavior and the frictional response requires a (quasi-)variational inequality to be solved in each time step, we derive a non-smooth multiscale method, which allows for the efficient and robust solution of these highly non-linear problems. The convergence of this multiscale method is proven for the case of Tresca friction. For the case of Coulomb friction, an inexact fixed point iteration in the normal stresses is used. We furthermore, consider the case of two-body contact. Here, the information transfer at the contact interface is realized by means of mortar methods, which provide a stable discretization of the relative displacements and the stresses at the contact boundary. Numerical results for the resulting fully discrete scheme in 3D are presented, showing the high accuracy of the proposed method.},

Here, we present these algorithms in a consistent notation and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the respective approaches.

This representation is easy to implement using standard rotordynamic tools. However, in reality the dynamic behavior of the substructure (e.g. pedestals, casings, foundations) can be much more complex. Only a multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) representation provides modelling close to reality. Usually the substructure consists of several components which are designed, assessed and modelled by the individual departments and/or disciplines. For many applications the dynamic behavior of the substructure significantly influences the rotordynamic characteristics of the shaft train and therefore needs to be included in the assessment. Numerous theoretical approaches exist for considering the complex behavior of the substructure, all coming along with drawbacks and opportunities.

behavior that is not captured by linear vibration theory such as

localization and frequency-energy dependence. The nonlinear

normal mode (NNM) concept, developed over the last few

decades, can be quite helpful in characterizing a structure's

nonlinear response. In the definition of interest, an NNM is a

periodic solution to the conservative nonlinear equations of

motion. Several approaches have been suggested for computing

NNMs and some have been quite successful even for systems

methods are still too expensive to employ on realistic nonlinear

finite element models, especially when the Jacobian of the

equations of motion is not available analytically. This work

presents a new approach for numerically calculating nonlinear

normal modes by combining force appropriation, numerical

integration and continuation techniques. This method does not

require gradients, is found to compute the NNMs accurately up

to moderate response amplitudes, and could be readily

extended to experimentally characterize nonlinear structures.

The method is demonstrated on a nonlinear mass-springdamper

 abstract = {Structural modification procedures are widely used to predict changes in the dynamics of a structure based on the addition of stiffeners, reinforcements, modifications of bolted joints, and payloads. A truncated modal basis of a linear dynamic system can be used to predict the changes of the mode shapes and frequencies due these modifications. This work proposes an extension of modal structural modification for geometrically nonlinear structures, by representing the structure with a set of nonlinear normal modes. An approximate quasi-linear modal model is defined from the fundamental frequency and maximum deformation shape of the nonlinear normal mode solutions. The resulting quasi-linear model has energy dependent mode shapes and natural frequencies. An iterative algorithm then applies modal structural modification to the quasi-linear modal model such that the modal parameters used in the substructuring routine are appropriate for each response level of interest. The method is demonstrated on a finite element model of a geometrically nonlinear beam with a variable elastic boundary condition. The model is meant to mimic the uncertain boundary conditions of a substructure in a hypersonic air vehicle. The nonlinear normal modes are computed for the unmodified beam, and a torsion spring is added to the boundary using the proposed method. It is found to give accurate predictions of the nonlinear modes of the assembly, potentially at a greatly reduced computational cost. {\copyright} The Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc. 2014.},

 abstract = {The nonlinear normal modes of a dynamical system provide a modal framework in which the dynamics of a structure can be readily understood. Current numerical approaches use continuation to find a nonlinear normal mode branch that initiates at a low energy, linearized mode. The predictor-corrector based approach follows the periodic solutions as the response amplitude increases, forming the nonlinear normal mode. This method uses the Jacobian of the shooting function in a Newton-Raphson algorithm to find the initial conditions and integration period that result in a periodic response of the conservative equations of motion. Large scale finite element models require that the Jacobian be computed using finite differences since the closed form equations are not explicitly available. The Jacobian must be computed with respect to all of the states, making the algorithm prohibitively expensive for models with many degrees-of-freedom. In this paper, the initial conditions of each periodic solution are determined based on a subset of the linear modes of a geometrically nonlinear finite element model. The first approach, termed enforced modal displacement, sets the initial conditions as a linear combination of linear mode shapes. The second approach, here called the applied modal force method, applies a static load to the structure in a combination of applied forces that would excite a single linear mode, computes the static response to that load, and uses that to set the initial conditions. Both of these algorithms greatly reduce the number of variables that are iterated on during continuation. As a result, the cost of computing each solution along the nonlinear normal mode is only on the order of ten times the cost required to integrate the finite element model over one period of the response. The algorithm is initiated with only one linear mode and additional modes are added in a systematic way as they become important to the periodic solutions along the nonlinear mode branch. The approach is demonstrated on two geometrically nonlinear finite element models, showing a dramatic reduction in the computational cost required to obtain the nonlinear normal mode.},

 abstract = {The efficiency of a modal substructuring method depends on the component modes used to reduce each subcomponent model. Methods such as Craig--Bampton have been used extensively to reduce linear finite-element models with thousands or even millions of degrees of freedom down orders of magnitude while maintaining acceptable accuracy. A novel reduction method is proposed here for geometrically nonlinear finite-element models using the fixed-interface and constraint modes of the linearized system to reduce each subcomponent model. The geometric nonlinearity requires an additional cubic and quadratic polynomial function in the modal equations, and the nonlinear stiffness coefficients are determined by applying a series of static loads and using the finite-element code to compute the response. The geometrically nonlinear, reduced modal equations for each subcomponent are then coupled by satisfying compatibility and force equilibrium. This modal substructuring approach is an extension of the Craig--Bampton method and is readily applied to geometrically nonlinear models built directly within commercial finite-element packages. The efficiency of this new approach is demonstrated on two example problems: one that couples two geometrically nonlinear beams at a shared rotational degree of freedom, and another that couples an axial spring element to the axial degree of freedom of a geometrically nonlinear beam. The nonlinear normal modes of the assembled models are compared with those of a truth model to assess the accuracy of the novel modal substructuring approach.

This work uses the short-time Fourier transform to estimate the instantaneous parameters from measured or simulated data. By combining the discrete Fourier transform with an expanding or contracting window function that moves along the time axis, the resulting spectra are used to estimate the instantaneous frequencies, damping ratios and complex Fourier coefficients.

Slipping of one body with respect to another is accomplished by an iterative nodal splitting technique. Solutions are obtained separately for normal and inclined loads for various coefficients of friction. It is shown that when only a normal load is acting, the adhesion zone is centrally located with the creep zone symmetrically placed on both sides. The larger the friction coefficient, the larger is the size of the adhesion zone until for a high enough coefficient, the entire contact area becomes the adhesion zone. When both normal and lateral loads are acting, the adhesion zone moves away from the center in a sense opposite to the direction of the external lateral load to an extent depending on the ratio of the vertical to lateral loads. For values above a certain ratio, the adhesion zone remains at the edge of the contact area. Relative size and movement of the adhesion and creep zones for different friction coefficients and horizontal to vertical load ratios are calculated and plotted.},

Effects of friction damping on the mean square response of a blade are investigated. The friction coefficient of the damper is assumed to be a function of the sliding velocity of the contact surface. The effects of stiffness and damping mistuning on the forced response of frictionally damped bladed disk are investigated. Numerical studies are presented for a pair of mistuned blades of cyclic assemblies. The response and reliability of a blade subjected to random excitation is also obtained. With time averaged probability density as an invariant measure, the probability of large excursion in case of damping mistuning is also presented.

This is computationally very costly for steady state response analysis. In this study, a powerful and economical method is developed for the harmonic response analysis of non-linear structures. In this method, the equations of motion are first converted into a set of non-linear algebraic equations, and then the number of equations to be solved is reduced by employing linear modes of the system. The resulting coupled algebraic equations are solved iteratively. The concept of the pseudo-receptance matrix is introduced in calculating the steady state response. It is shown that the reduction in computational time can be considerable as very accurate results can be obtained by using only a limited number of modes. Several example problems are solved in order to illustrate the performance of the method. Effects of higher modes and higher harmonic components of the response are discussed in detail. In order to illustrate the accuracy and speed of the method suggested, the results obtained by applying the so called Iterative Modal Method are compared with those obtained by the Newmark method which is used as a classical time domain analysis technique.},

First, we perform empirical mode decomposition (EMD) on the acceleration responses measured at ten, almost evenly-spaced, spanwise positions along the beam leading to sets of intrinsic modal oscillators governing the vibro-impact dynamics at different time scales. In particular, the EMD analysis can separate any nonsmooth effects caused by vibro-impacts of the beam and the rigid stops from the smooth (elastodynamic) response, so that nonlinear modal interactions caused by vibro-impacts can be explored only with the remaining smooth components. Then, we establish nonlinear interaction models (NIMs) for the respective intrinsic modal oscillators, where the NIMs invoke slowly-varying forcing amplitudes that can be computed from empirical slow-flows. By comparing the spatio-temporal variations of the nonlinear modal interactions for the vibro-impact beam and those of the underlying linear model (i.e., the beam with no rigid constraints), we demonstrate that vibro-impacts significantly influence the lower-frequency modes, introducing spatial modal distortions, whereas the higher frequency modes tend to retain their linear dynamics between impacts. We introduce a linear correlation coefficient as a measure for studying the linear dependency between the slowly-varying complex forcing amplitudes for the linear and vibro-impact beams and demonstrate that only a set of lower-frequency modes are strongly influenced by vibro-impacts, capturing most of the essential nonlinear dynamics. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach to analyze strongly nonlinear measured time series and provide physical insight for strong nonlinear dynamical interactions.},

 abstract = {This work presents a new technique for nonlinear system identification that utilizes near-resonant steady-state harmonically excited vibration measurements to estimate the Nonlinear Normal Mode backbones. The algorithm is based on the previously proposed Single Nonlinear Resonant Mode formula and uses it in a new and more effective way to estimate one point on the nonlinear mode from only one steady-state measurement collected near the resonance. A by-product of this work is a derivation of a novel formula expressing how the damping ratio changes with the motion amplitude. Several measurements at various forcing amplitudes can be combined to estimate the nonlinear mode and damping as a function of amplitude, which can be further used to predict the forced steady-state response of the structure in the vicinity of the mode of interest. Compared to existing phase resonance methods, the proposed technique can reduce the time required to obtain measurements and avoids difficulties due to e.g. the premature jump phenomenon. The algorithm assumes that the modes are well-separated and no internal resonances are present in the system. Additionally, it requires the accurate identification of linear modes in the low-amplitude vibration tests and it assumes that the nonlinear normal mode shape does not change significantly with response amplitude The method is first evaluated numerically using reduced models of clamped--clamped flat and curved beams that exhibit both stiffening and softening--stiffening responses, respectively. Then the method is employed experimentally to measure the NNM backbones of beams that were manufactured from polylactide using a 3D printer and experience significant eigen-frequency shifts when the motion amplitude increases. The results are validated against measurements collected using the traditional phase resonance testing approach.},

 abstract = {The sensitivity of the nonlinear dynamic response to damage is investigated in simply supported beams by computing the nonlinear normal modes (NNMs) and exploiting the rich information they unfold about the nonlinear system behavior. Damage is introduced as a reduction of the flexural stiffness within a small segment of the beam span. The problem is formulated in a piece-wise fashion and analytically tackled by using the method of multiple scales to compute the NNMs and the backbone curves. The latter describe the frequency versus free oscillation amplitude for each mode and as such they represent the skeleton of the nonlinear frequency response around each beam modal frequency. The bending of the backbones is regulated by the so-called effective nonlinearity coefficients associated with each mode. The comparison between the damaged and undamaged beams shows a sensitivity of the effective nonlinearity coefficients higher than the sensitivity of the linear natural frequencies. Moreover, the nonlinear frequency trends unfold an interesting dependence of the nonlinear free response on the stiffness reduction at the damage site. Such dependence yields useful information about the damage position. An effective identification strategy for the damage position is proposed by computing the damage-induced discontinuities in the second derivative of the NNMs (i.e., first order estimate of the bending curvature), without resorting to a baseline model of the undamaged beam. This goal is achieved by computing a high order derivative of the Nadaraya--Watson kernel estimator, which is evaluated from a finite set of sampled beam deflections associated with each individual NNM. The results show that the second derivatives of higher NNMs are more sensitive to damage-induced discontinuities than the linear modal curvatures. The robustness against noise of the damage identification process is also discussed. {\copyright} 2016 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht},

Structures with mechanical joints are difficult to model accurately. Even if the natural frequencies of the system remain essentially constant, the damping introduced by the joints is often observed to change dramatically with amplitude. Although models for individual joints have been employed with some success, accurately modeling a structure with many joints remains a significant obstacle. To this end, Segalman proposed a modal Iwan model, which simplifies the analysis by modeling a system with a linear superposition of weakly-nonlinear, uncoupled single degree-of-freedom systems or modes. Given a simulation model with discrete joints, one can identify the model for each mode by selectively exciting each mode one at a time and observing how the transient response decays. However, in the environment of interest several modes may be excited simultaneously, such as in an experiment when an impulse is applied at a discrete point. In this work, the modal Iwan model framework is assessed numerically to understand how well it captures the dynamic response of typical structures with joints when they are excited with impulsive forces applied at point locations. This is done by comparing the effective natural frequency and modal damping of the uncoupled modal models with those of truth models that include nonlinear modal coupling. These concepts are explored for two structures, a simple spring-mass system and a finite element model of a beam, both of which contain physical Iwan elements to model joint nonlinearity. The results show that modal Iwan models can effectively capture the variations in frequency and damping with amplitude, which, for damping, can increase by as much as two orders of magnitude in the microslip regime. However, even in the microslip regime the accuracy of a modal Iwan model is found to depend on whether the mode in question is dominant in the response; in some cases the effective damping that the uncoupled model predicts is found to be in error by tens of percent. Nonetheless, the modal model captures the response qualitatively and is still far superior to a linear model.},

Motivated by the current demands in high-performance structural analysis, and by a need to better model systems with localized nonlinearities, analysts have developed a number of different approaches for modeling and simulating the dynamics of a bolted-joint structure. However, it is still unclear which approach might be most effective for a given system or set of conditions. To better grasp their similarities and differences, this paper presents a numerical benchmark that assesses how well two diametrically differing joint modeling approaches -- a time-domain whole-joint approach and a frequency-domain node-to-node approach -- predict and simulate a mechanical joint. These approaches were applied to model the Brake-Reu{\ss} beam, a prismatic structure comprised of two beams with a bolted joint interface. The two approaches were validated first by updating the models to reproduce the nonlinear response for the first bending mode of an experimental Brake-Reu{\ss} beam. Afterwards, the tuned models were evaluated on their ability to predict the nonlinearity in the dynamic response for the second and third bending modes. The results show that the two joint modeling approaches perform about equally as well in simulating the Brake-Reu{\ss} beam. In addition, the exposition highlights improvements that were made in each method during the course of this work and reveal further challenges in advancing the state-of-the-art.},

These two properties could be derived from dynamic simulations (for example, by computing the response of the structure to an impulsive force), but such simulations are expensive. Any updating strategy based on dynamic simulation therefore becomes cumbersome. A solution was provided by Festjens et al. (2013) whereby the joint is treated as a static subcomponent in an otherwise dynamic global model. This work proposes a few modifications to their theory, resulting in a highly-efficient quasi-static algorithm that can be used to compute the amplitude-dependent frequency and damping by loading the finite element model in the shape of one of its modes. This new quasi-static method was then utilized to update a set of Iwan joint parameters so that the shift in the frequencies and damping seen in the finite element model matched those from measurements on an experimental beam containing three bolted joints. The updated model was then verified to be capable of capturing with good accuracy the effects of modal coupling seen in the impact response of the beam.},

In this paper, two such contact force models are presented, both Hertzian in nature and based upon the direct-central impact of two solid particles. At low impact velocities, the energy dissipation during impact can be represented by material damping. A model is constructed based on the general trend of the Hertz contact law in conjuction with a hysteresis damping function. The unknown parameters are determined in terms of a given coefficient of restitution and the impact velocity. When local plasticity effects are the dominant factor accounting for the dissipation of energy at high impact velocities, a Hertzian contact force model with permanent indentation is constructed. Utilizing energy and momentum considerations, the unknown parameters in the model are again evaluated.

 abstract = {Abstract The purpose of this paper is the parametric study of the non-linear aero-elastic phenomena of a bladed disk for aeronautical applications in the presence of friction contacts using a one-way coupled method. The calculation is performed using a method based on the Harmonic Balance Method (HBM) and the balance between the energy introduced by the unsteady aerodynamics on the blade airfoil and the dissipative energy. The HBM method is preferred with respect to the Direct Time Integration (DTI) for the strong reduction of the computation time that HBM technique allows in spite of an acceptable level of approximation when nonlinearities are introduced and the response is periodic. The nonlinearity is introduced by purposely developed contact elements, placed at the blade root-joints, that produce additional stiffening and damping in the system due the introduction of contact stiffness and friction forces based on Coulomb's law. The aero-elastic equilibrium will be investigated through a sensitivity analysis of the Limit Cycle Oscillations (LCO) of the system. The effect of such variations will be highlighted in order to demonstrate what are the parameters that influence most the blade amplitude, both for the CFD and the mechanical simulation. In particular, the uncertainty in the definition of the contact parameters at the blade root will be taken into account by varying the friction coefficient and the normal force distribution on the blade joint. Finally, the results of the analysis will be compared with the experimental data produced with a cold-flow test rig to verify if the sensitivity study associated to the simplifications introduced in the method are compatible with the measured response.},

 abstract = {Recently, the development of shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators, in the forms of wire, thin film and stent have been found increasingly in the fields of materials science and smart structures and engineering. The increase in attraction for using these materials is due to their many unique materials, mechanical, thermal and thermal-mechanical properties, which in turn, evolve their subsequent shape memory, pseudo-elasticity and super-elasticity properties. In this paper, a common type of SMA actuator, Nitinol wires, were embedded into advanced composite structures to modulate the structural dynamic responses, in terms of natural frequency and damping ratio by using its shape memory and pseudo-elastic properties. A simple theoretical model is introduced to estimate the natural frequency of the structures before and after actuating the embedded SMA wires. The damping ratios of different SMA composite beams were measured through experimental approaches. The natural frequencies changed slightly at a temperature above the austenite finish temperature of composite beams with embedded non-prestrained SMA wires. However, the increase of the natural frequencies of the beams with embedded prestrained SMA wires were found in both the theoretical prediction and experimental measurements. The damping ratios of SMA composite beams increased with increasing the temperature of the embedded wires with and without being pre-strained. Compressive and local failures of the beams with high wire content are a possible explanation. {\copyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {The incremental method has been widely used in various types of nonlinear analysis, however, so far it has received little attention in the analysis of periodic nonlinear vibrations. In this paper, an amplitude incremental variational principle for nonlinear vibrations of elastic systems is derived. Based on this principle various approximate procedures can be adapted to the incremental formulation. The linear solution for the system is used as the starting point of the solution procedure and the amplitude is then increased incrementally. Within each incremental step, only a set of linear equations has to be solved to obtain the data for the next stage. To show the effectiveness of the present method, some typical examples of nonlinear free vibrations of plates and shallow shells are computed. Comparison with analytical results calculated by using elliptic integral confirms that excellent accuracy can be achieved. The technique is applicable to highly nonlinear problems as well as problems with only weak nonlinearity.},

@phdthesis{laum2002,
 abstract = {With the present drive in turbomachine engine development towards thinner and lighter

bladings, closer spaced blade rows and higher aerodynamic loads per blade row and

blade, advanced design criteria and accurate prediction methods for vibrational problems

such as forced response become increasingly important in order to be able to address and

avoid fatigue failures of the machine early in the design process. The present work

supports both the search for applicable design criteria and the development of advanced

prediction methods for forced response in transonic turbine stages. It is aimed at a better

understanding of the unsteady aerodynamic mechanisms that govern forced response in

transonic turbine stages and further development of numerical methods for rotor stator

interaction predictions.



The investigation of the unsteady aerodynamic excitation mechanisms is based on

numerical predictions of the three-dimensional unsteady flow field in representative test

turbine stages. It is conducted in three successive steps. The first step is a documentation

of the pressure perturbations on the blade surface and the distortion sources in the blade

passage. This is performed in a phenomenological manner so that the observed pressure

perturbations are related to the distortion phenomena that are present in the blade

passage. The second step is the definition of applicable measures to quantify the pressure

perturbation strength on the blade surface. In the third step, the pressure perturbations are

integrated along the blade arc to obtain the dynamic blade force. The study comprises an

investigation of operation variations and addresses radial forcing variations. With the help

of this bottom-up approach the basic forcing mechanisms of transonic turbine stages are

established and potential routes to control the aerodynamic forcing are presented.



For the computation of rotor stator interaction aerodynamics for stages with arbitrary pitch

ratios a new numerical method has been developed, validated and demonstrated on a

transonic turbine test stage. The method, which solves the unsteady three-dimensional

Euler equations, is formulated in the four-dimensional time-space domain and the

derivation of the method is general such that both phase lagged boundary conditions and

moving grids are considered. Time-inclination is utilised to account for unequal pitchwise

periodicity by distributing time co-ordinates at grid nodes such that the phase lagged

boundary conditions can be employed. The method is demonstrated in a comparative

study on a transonic turbine stage with a nominal non integer blade count ratio and an

adjusted blade count ratio with a scaled rotor geometry. The predictions show significant

differences in the blade pressure perturbation signal of the second vane passing

frequency, which would motivate the application of the new method for rotor stator

predictions with non-integer blade count ratios.},

 abstract = {Abstract 10.1002/nme.1620362005.abs In this paper, a formulation is presented for the finite element treatment of multibody, large deformation frictional contact problems. The term multibody is used to mean that when two bodies mechanically contact, both may be deformable. A novel aspect of the approach advocated is that the equations governing contact are developed in the continuum setting first, before deriving the corresponding finite element equations This feature distinguishes the current work from many earlier treatments of contact problems and renders it considerably more general. In particular, the approach yields a characterization of the frictional constraint (assuming a Coulomb law) suitable for arbitrary discretizations in either two or three dimensions. A geometric framework is constructed within which both frictionless and frictional response are naturally described, making subsequent finite element discretization a straightforward substitution of finite-dimensional solution spaces for their continuum counterparts. To our knowledge, this general formulation and implementation of the frictional contact problem in a finite element setting has not been reported previously in the literature. The development includes exact linearization of the statement of virtual work, which enables optimal convergence properties for Newton-Raphson solution strategies, and which appears to be highly desirable (if not essential) for the general robustness of implicit finite element techniques. Since the theory and subsequent linearization require no limitations on the amount of deformation or relative sliding that can occur, the resulting treatment of frictional contact is suitable for a wide range of examples displaying significant non-linear behaviour. This assertion is substantiated through presentation of a variety of examples in both two and three dimensions.},

@article{Lavella.2013,
 abstract = {In jet engines the blade resonant vibration amplitude is normally reduced by increasing the structural damping by using, for example, tip shrouds. These devices dissipate the energy generated at the contact surfaces between the relative motion and the friction force. Contact parameters, principally the friction coefficient and contact stiffness, are required to characterize the dynamics of shrouded blade system. Moreover, if at these contact surfaces severe wear occurs, a loss of interference takes place and the energy dissipated by the shroud decreases. Consequently the blade vibration amplitude increases and a catastrophic blade failure could take place. In this work a test rig for the contact parameter measurements and micro wear characterization of flat-on-flat contact surfaces has been developed. The test rig works at high temperatures of up to 1000°C, by means of induction heating. One of the specimens was attached to the rig frame, basically an inertial mass and four springs, and subsequently excited by an electromagnetic shaker. The second specimen was allowed to approach the first specimen and to rotate in such a way that the geometric contact between the two surfaces occurred at three points. In this way a real ``flat to flat'' contact was obtained. The two surfaces were kept in contact by means of a constant normal load. The tangential contact force was measured by a force sensor while the relative displacements between the contact surfaces were measured by two laser vibrometers. The relative displacement was kept under control by acting on the shaker force. Tangential force and relative displacement were used to describe the hysteresis loop and, consequently, to obtain the friction coefficient and contact stiffness during the wear process. The temperature is feedback controlled by using two thermocouples placed within the specimens near the contact surfaces. The main results are the characterization of the contact parameters and the wear behavior of real flat-on-flat contact surfaces, and the possibility of measuring easily the wear volume history of the same pair of specimens with a negligible perturbation to the wear processes from volume measurements.},

The success of SSA relies on the extraction of that mechanical response from the mixed signal. Owing to the relatively high amplitudes of those two signals and the ambience varying property of the equivalent capacitance of the piezoelectric element, a fix designed bridge circuit in the SSA configuration would extract a corrupted mechanical response under the variation of the piezoelectric capacitance. This would degrade the system performance or even destabilize the closed loop system. In this paper, an adaptive compensation is proposed to combine with the SSA technique to develop a vibration controller that is capable of extracting the true sensing signal due to structural deformation. The results of this study illustrate that the combined design can simultaneously suppress the structural vibration during the piezoelectric capacitance variation.},

The periodic solutions of this system are studied and their calculation is performed through an averaging procedure. The study of non-linear modes and their stability shows, under specific conditions, the existence of localization which is responsible for a passive irreversible energy transfer from the linear oscillator to the non-linear one. The dissipative effect of the non-linearity appears to play an important role in the energy transfer phenomenon and some design criteria can be drawn regarding this parameter among others to optimize this energy transfer. The free transient response is investigated and it is shown that the energy transfer appears when the energy input is sufficient in accordance with the predictions from the non-linear modes. Finally, the steady-state forced response of the system is investigated.

The new system is based on the inerter, a device that was initially developed for high-performance suspensions in Formula 1 racing cars. The principal advantage of the inerter is that a high level of vibration isolation can be achieved with low amounts of added mass. This feature makes it an attractive potential alternative to traditional tuned mass dampers (TMDs). In this paper, the inerter system is modelled inside a multi-storey building and is located on braces between adjacent storeys. Numerical results show that an excellent level of vibration reduction is achieved, potentially offering improvement over TMDs. The inerter-based system is compared to a TMD system by using a range of base excitation inputs, including an earthquake signal, to demonstrate how the performance could potentially be improved by using an inerter instead of a TMD.},

The TID consists of an inerter, a device that exerts a force proportional to relative acceleration, coupled with a parallel spring and damper. It may be thought of as similar to a tuned-mass-damper, but requiring two terminals. As a two terminal device, the performance of the TID is compared to the classical use of viscous dampers (VD) located close to one of the cable supports. We show that the limitation that exists with VDs, where the modal damping of the cable cannot exceed a maximum level for a given damper location, can be overcome through the use of the TID at the same location. A practical design methodology, based on the minimisation of the displacement amplitude at the mid-span of the cable subjected to support excitation, is proposed. An example where a cable is subjected to the El-Centro earthquake demonstrates that the system's response is improved when a TID is used instead of a VD.},

 abstract = {Energy transfer and mode localization in a translating string, coupled to a stationary spring-mass-damper system, are analyzed using traveling waves. The string tension and the non-conservative centrifugal force at the constraint lead to energy transfer between the translating continuum and the stationary constraint. By calculating energy contained in a harmonic wave before and after interacting with the constraint, energy transferred at the constraint is quantified in terms of constraint parameters. At an undamped constraint, energy is transmitted when a downstream (forward) wave impinges on the constraint. At a damped constraint, energy dissipated by damping, as well as energy flux by the tension and centrifugal force, contribute to the energy variation at the coupling point. When the damping coefficient of the damped constraint equals twice the impedance of the string, vibration energy is maximally dissipated. Asymmetry caused by the constraint localizes vibration modes into a downstream or upstream region. The degree of localization in each vibration mode is described in terms of the reflection coefficient and the constraint location. The effect of the constraint parameters on the mode localization and veering of natural frequency loci are also examined. {\copyright} 1998 Academic Press Limited.},

The response is expressed as an expansion in terms of the linear, free oscillation modes, and its amplitude is considered to be small but finite. The method of multiple scales is used to reduce the non-linear governing equations to a system of autonomous ordinary differential equations for amplitude and phase variables. For a numerical example the case of internal resonance (a commensurable relationship between natural frequencies), \textgreek{w}32 $\approx$ 3\textgreek{w}11, where the first subscript refers to the number of nodal diameters and the second subscript the number of nodal circles including boundary is considered. When the frequency of excitation is near \textgreek{w}11, there exist at most five stable steady-state responses. Four of them are superpositions of traveling wave components and one is a superposition of standing wave components. The results shows the interaction between modes corresponding to \textgreek{w}11 and \textgreek{w}32 by showing non-vanishing amplitudes of the mode not directly excited. When the frequency of excitation is near \textgreek{w}32, similarly the interaction between modes is shown to exist. All of the responses with non-vanishing amplitudes of modes excited indirectly, however, turn out to be unstable, which is a peculiar phenomenon.},

We show that it is feasible to partially or even completely suppress aeroelastic instability by passively transferring vibration energy from the wing to the NES in a one-way irreversible fashion. Moreover, this instability suppression is performed by partially or completely eliminating its triggering mechanism. Numerical parametric studies identify three main mechanisms for suppressing aeroelastic instability: recurring burstout and suppression, intermediate suppression, and complete elimination. We investigate these mechanisms both numerically by the Hilbert-Huang transform and analytically by a complexification-averaging technique. Each suppression mechanism involves strong 1:1 resonance capture during which the NES absorbs and dissipates a significant portion of energy fed from the flow to the wing. Failure of suppression is associated with restoring the underlying triggering mechanism of instability, which is a series of superharmonic resonance captures followed by escapes from resonance. Finally, using a numerical continuation technique, we perform a bifurcation analysis to examine sensitive dependence on initial conditions and thus robustness of instability suppression.

A numerical bifurcation analysis of limit cycle oscillations of the wing with the multi-degree-of-freedom nonlinear energy sinks attached shows that controlling the lower parameter value for limit point cycle bifurcation to occur above Hopf bifurcation is crucial to enhancing the robustness of limit cycle oscillation suppression. We demonstrate that multi-degree-of-freedom nonlinear energy sinks can greatly enhance the robustness of limit cycle oscillation suppression, compared with single-degree-of-freedom nonlinear energy sinks (which were studied in our previous papers), with a much smaller total mass. We also investigate the nonlinear modal interactions that occur between the aeroelastic modes and the multi-degree-of-freedom nonlinear energy sinks, in an effort to gain a physical understanding of the mechanisms governing instability suppression.

First, the complicated dynamics of such VI systems is demonstrated by computing the VI periodic orbits of underlying Hamiltonian systems and depicting them in appropriate frequency--energy plots (FEPs). Then, VI damped transitions and distinct ways of passive TETs from the linear oscillators to the VI attachments for various parameter ranges and initial conditions are investigated. As in the case of smooth stiffness nonlinearity [Y. Lee, G. Kerschen, A. Vakakis, P. Panagopoulos, L. Bergman, D.M.

It is found that the most efficient mechanism for VI TET is through the excitation of highly energetic VI impulsive orbits (IOs), i.e.,~of periodic or quasiperiodic orbits corresponding to zero initial conditions except for the initial velocities of the linear oscillators. In contrast to NESs with smooth essential nonlinearities considered in previous works, VI NESs are capable of passively absorbing and locally dissipating significant portions of the energies of the primary systems to which they are attached, at fast time scale. This renders such devices suitable for applications, like seismic mitigation, where dissipation of vibration energy in the early, highly energetic regime of the motion is a critical requirement.},

The eigenfrequencies of IMOs are characterised by the 'fast' dynamics of the problem and their forcing terms represent slowly-varying nonlinear modal interactions across the different time scales of the dynamics. We demonstrate that NIMs not only provide information on modal energy exchanges under nonlinear resonant interactions, but also directly dictate robustness behaviour of TET mechanisms for suppressing aeroelastic instabilities.

 abstract = {A new analytical method is proposed for the estimation of eigensolutions for undamped and proportionally damped discrete vibratory systems when the system parameters are uncertain or random variables. Given several simplifying assumptions, a direct product technique is used to estimate the first and second moments of eigensolutions in terms of the moments of system parameter matrices. The proposed methodology is reasonably accurate and computationally fast, when compared with existing methods such as the first perturbation method and the Monte Carlo simulation. Application of the new method is demonstrated through several single- and multi-degree-of-freedom systems. It is seen that the standard deviation predictions match well with the results yielded by the Monte Carlo simulation, unlike the first order perturbation method, especially when moderately large random fluctuations are considered. The impulse response issue is addressed in the companion paper (Part II).},

This paper presents a method for analysis of the eddy current in the special case of a rotating disk in a time-invariant field. The analysis uses Coulomb's law and the method of images to consider the boundary conditions. First, the surface charge generated in the rotating disk is obtained and Coulomb's law is applied to calculate the electric field intensity, assuming an infinite disk radius. Second, the finite disk radius is taken into account by introducing an imaginary electric field intensity to satisfy the boundary condition that the radial component of the eddy current is zero at the edge of the rotating disk. Third, the braking torque is calculated by applying the Lorentz force law. The paper compares the computed braking torque with the experimental results to establish the validity of the model},

We consider first the undamped system and perform a numerical study based on non-smooth transformations to determine its periodic solutions in a frequency--energy plot. It is found that there is a sequence of periodic solutions bifurcating or emanating from the main backbone curve of the plot. We then study analytically the periodic orbits of the undamped system using a complexification/averaging technique in order to determine the frequency contents of the various branches of solutions, and to understand the types of oscillation performed by the system at the different regimes of the motion. The transient responses of the weakly damped system are then examined, and numerical wavelet transforms are used to study the time evolutions of their harmonic components. We show that the structure of periodic orbits of the undamped system greatly influences the damped dynamics, as it causes complicated transitions between modes in the damped transient motion. In addition, there is the possibility of strong passive energy transfer (energy pumping) from the linear oscillator to the nonlinear attachment if certain periodic orbits of the undamped dynamics are excited by the initial conditions.},

 abstract = {We present the basic components of a time-domain nonlinear system identification (NSI) method with a promise of applicability to a broad class of smooth and non-smooth dynamical systems. The proposed NSI method is based on the close correspondence between analytical and empirical slow-flow dynamics, and relies on the direct analysis of measured time series without any a priori assumptions on the system dynamics; i.e. it is purely an output-based approach. The central assumption of the methodology is that the measured time series can be decomposed in terms of a finite number of oscillating components that are in the form of `fast' monochromatic oscillations modulated by `slow' amplitudes. The empirical slow-flow model of the dynamics is obtained from empirical mode decomposition (EMD), and its correspondence to the analytical slow-flow model establishes a local nonlinear interaction model (NIM). A NIM consists of a set of intrinsic modal oscillators (IMOs) that can reproduce the measured time series over different time scales and can account for (even strongly) nonlinear modal interactions. Hence, it represents a local model of the dynamics, identifying specific nonlinear transitions. An IMO, whose response can reproduce the corresponding intrinsic mode function acquired from EMD analysis, represents the dynamical characteristics of the system under certain initial or parameter conditions (i.e. local aspects). By collecting energy-dependent frequency behaviors from all identified IMOs, a frequency-energy plot (in the modal space) can be constructed, which depicts global features of the dynamical system. This represents a global model of the dynamics. We demonstrate the efficacy of the outlined global--local NSI method with two-degree-of-freedom dynamical systems---one smooth, and the other non-smooth.

Actually, in order to be competitive, a manufacturer has one main objective: increasing

the engine efficiency in agreement with current regulations. To fulfill this condition, it

is desirable to reduce the clearance between stationary and rotating parts. Consequently,

reduced clearance highly increases the possibility of violent contact between the structures.

Such a nonlinear phenomenon may result in severe damage to the engine and engineers

must design structures capable of withstanding this kind of dynamical loads: then, it is

a primary concern to get a full insight of the physical mechanisms in order to optimize

the gap between the two structural parts without jeopardizing passengers' safety. In this

study, we focus on the interaction of two nodal diameter modes, typical of axisymmetric

structures, during which, structures slightly touch each other leading to a steady-state

behavior potentially dangerous. To this aim, three models with growing complexity are

detailed in conjunction with two complementary numerical approaches in the time and

frequency domains. Respective results predict a critical rotational velocity of the engine

above which, under certain circumstances, vibration amplitudes become large. They also

These two structures, featuring rotational periodicity and axisymmetry, respectively, share the same type of eigenshapes, also termed nodal diameter traveling waves. Higher efficiency requirements leading to reduced clearance between blade-tips and casing together with the rotation of the bladed disk increase the possibility of interaction between these traveling waves through direct contact. By definition, large amplitudes as well as structural failure may be expected. A very simple two-dimensional model of outer casing and bladed disk is introduced in order to predict the occurrence of such phenomenon in terms of rotational velocity. In order to consider traveling wave motions, each structure is represented by its two nd-nodal diameter standing modes. Equations of motion are solved first using an explicit time integration scheme in conjunction with the Lagrange multiplier method, which accounts for the contact constraints, and then by the harmonic balance method (HBM).

 abstract = {Minimizing the operating clearance between rotating bladed-disks and stationary surrounding casings is a primary concern in the design of modern turbomachines since it may advantageously affect their energy efficiency. This technical choice possibly leads to interactions between elastic structural components through direct unilateral contact and dry friction, events which are now accepted as normal operating conditions. Subsequent nonlinear dynamical behaviors of such systems are commonly investigated with simplified academic models mainly due to theoretical difficulties and numerical challenges involved in non-smooth large-scale realistic models. In this context, the present paper introduces an adaptation of a full three-dimensional contact strategy for the prediction of potentially damaging motions that would imply highly demanding computational efforts for the targeted aerospace application in an industrial context. It combines a smoothing procedure including bicubic B-spline patches together with a Lagrange multiplier based contact strategy within an explicit time-marching integration procedure preferred for its versatility.

The proposed algorithm is first compared on a benchmark configuration against the more elaborated bi-potential formulation and the commercial software Ansys. The consistency of the provided results and the low energy fluctuations of the introduced approach underlines its reliable numerical properties. A case study featuring blade-tip/casing contact on industrial finite element models is then proposed: it incorporates component mode synthesis and the developed three-dimensional contact algorithm for investigating structural interactions occurring within a turbomachine compressor stage. Both time results and frequency-domain analysis emphasize the practical use of such a numerical tool: detection of severe operating conditions and critical rotational velocities, time-dependent maps of stresses acting within the structures, parameter studies and blade design tests.},

The impacted rigid foundation provides a natural Poincar{\'e} section of the investigated system from which is formulated a smooth First Return Map well-defined away from the grazing trajectory. In order to focus on the impact-induced nonlinearity, the oscillator is assumed linear. Continuous one-parameter families of T-periodic orbits featuring one impact per period and lying on two-dimensional invariant manifolds in the state-space are shown to exist. The geometry of these piecewise-smooth manifolds is such that a linear ``flat'' portion (on which contact is not activated) is continuously attached to a purely nonlinear portion (on which contact is activated once per period) exhibiting a velocity discontinuity through a grazing orbit. These features explain the newly introduced terminology ``Nonsmooth modal analysis''. The stability of the periodic orbits lying on the invariant manifolds is also explored by calculating the eigenvalues of the linearized First Return Map. Internal resonances and multiple impacts per period are not addressed in this work. However, the pre-stressed case is succinctly described and extensions to multiple oscillators as well as self-contact are discussed. {\copyright} 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

 abstract = {The classical form of Hamilton's principle holds for conservative systems with perfect bilateral constraints. Several attempts have been made in literature to generalise Hamilton's principle for mechanical systems with perfect unilateral constraints involving impulsive motion. This has led to a number of different variants of Hamilton's principle, some expressed as variational inequalities. Up to now, the connection between these different principles has been missing. The aim of this paper is to put these different principles of Hamilton in a unified framework by using the concept of weak and strong extrema. The difference between weak and strong variations of the motion is explained in detail. Each type of variation leads to a variant of the principle of Hamilton in the form of a variational inequality. The conclusion of the paper is that each type of variation leads to different necessary and sufficient conditions on the impact law. The principle of Hamilton with strong variations is valid for perfect unilateral constraints with a completely elastic impact law, whereas the weak form of Hamilton's principle only requires perfect unilateral constraints and no condition on the energy. {\copyright} 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

 abstract = {Vibration energy scavenging, harvesting ambient vibrations in structures for conversion into usable electricity, provides a potential power source for emerging technologies including wireless sensor networks. Most vibration energy scavenging devices developed to date operate effectively at a single specific frequency dictated by the device's design. However, for this technology to be commercially viable, vibration energy scavengers that generate usable power across a range of driving frequencies must be developed. This paper details the design and testing of a tunable-resonance vibration energy scavenger which uses the novel approach of axially compressing a piezoelectric bimorph to lower its resonance frequency. It was determined that an axial preload can adjust the resonance frequency of a simply supported bimorph to 24{\%} below its unloaded resonance frequency. The power output to a resistive load was found to be 65--90{\%} of the nominal value at frequencies 19--24{\%} below the unloaded resonance frequency. Prototypes were developed that produced 300--400~µW of power at driving frequencies between 200 and 250~Hz. Additionally, piezoelectric coupling coefficient values were increased using this method, with keff values rising as much as 25{\%} from 0.37 to 0.46. Device damping increased 67{\%} under preload, from 0.0265 to 0.0445, adversely affecting the power output at lower frequencies. A theoretical model modified to include the effects of preload on damping predicted power output to within 0--30{\%} of values obtained experimentally. Optimal load resistance deviated significantly from theory, and merits further investigation.},

 abstract = {This paper proposes a new technique to reduce the noise generated by rotor-stator interaction (tonal noise) in fans and compressors. The method involves the use of single dielectric barrier discharge (plasma) actuators near the blade trailing edge to reduce blade wakes. Plasma actuators are a new and simple type of active flow control device consisting of two parallel and offset electrodes separated by a layer of dielectric material. The application of a high ac voltage at high frequency to the electrodes generates a body force on the flow in the vicinity of the electrodes to inject momentum without mass addition. A preliminary assessment of the proposed concept is performed with a computational study on modern low-speed compressor rotor geometry. A plasma actuator model is implemented in an established turbomachinery CFD code. Simulations are carried out to evaluate the effect of the actuator strength, location, and actuation method (continuous versus pulsed) on the rotor wake. Results show that plasma actuators operated in continuous mode near the trailing edge can significantly influence the wake of the rotor with relatively little power consumption. The effectiveness of the actuation is proportional to actuator strength (induced body force). The exact position of the actuator in the trailing edge region has little effect on the effectiveness of the actuation. The results from simulations with pulsed actuation show very low time-averaged influence on the wake and are not fully conclusive, due possibly to the frequencies simulated and the limitations of the RANS CFD tool. {\copyright} 2011 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.},

First, the effects of the excitation on periodic solutions are analyzed, focusing on bifurcations entailing their disappearance and playing the role of Koiter critical thresholds. Then, attractor robustness (i.e., large magnitude of the safe basin) is shown to be necessary but not sufficient to have global safety under dynamic excitation. In fact, the excitation strongly modifies the topology of the safe basins, and a dynamical integrity perspective accounting for the magnitude of the solely compact part of the safe basin must be considered. By means of extensive numerical simulations, robustness/erosion profiles of dynamic solutions/basins for varying axial load and dynamic amplitude are built, respectively. These curves permit to appreciate the practical reduction of system load carrying capacity and, upon choosing the value of residual integrity admissible for engineering design, the Thompson practical stability. Dwelling on the effects of the interaction between axial load and lateral dynamic excitation, this paper supports and, indeed, extends the conclusions of the companion one, highlighting the fundamental role played by global dynamics as regards a reliable estimation of the actual load carrying capacity of mechanical systems.},

 abstract = {An Acoustic Black Hole (ABH) in a one-dimensional (1D) beam is a passive vibration damping device based on a local reduction of the beam thickness attached to a thin layer of attenuating material. This work aims at revisiting the ABH effect by analysing the ABH trapped modes in the complex frequency plane. This analysis relies on an analytical model based on the one-dimensional thin beam theory and the transfer matrix method which assumes that the ABH termination is discretised by constant thickness piecewise elements. The model is validated with numerical simulations by the Finite Element Method. The reflection coefficients of several ABH terminations are studied. The results show that an ABH presents an infinite number of modes associated to an infinite number of poles and zeros of the reflection coefficient, the density and quality factor of which depend on the order of the ABH profile. By considering the ABH termination as an open lossy resonator, its damping efficiency results therefore from a balance between the energy leakage of each mode and its inherent losses, known as the critical coupling condition. In particular, the broadband absorption of the vibration energy is achieved for frequencies higher than that of the mode that is critically coupled. This type of analysis is used to interpret the ABH effect. It provides the losses needed to obtain the critical coupling condition, and is suitable for the optimisation of one-dimensional ABH terminations.},

We discuss a recently developed concept of limiting phase trajectories (LPTs) allowing a unified description of resonance, highly non-stationary processes for a wide range of classical and quantum dynamical systems with constant and varying parameters. This concept provides a far going extension and adequate mathematical description of the well-known linear beating phenomenon to a diverse variety of nonlinear systems ranging from classical multi-particle models to nonlinear quantum tunneling. While stationary (and non-stationary, but non-resonant) oscllations can be described in the framework of non-linear normal modes (NNMs) concept, it is not so in the considered case of resonant non-stationary processes. In the latter case which is characterized by intense energy exchange between different parts of a system, an additiional slow time scale appears. The energy exchange proceeds in this time scale and can be identified as strong modulation of the fast oscillations. The aforementioned resonant non-staionary prcesses include, e.g., targeted energy transfer, non-stationary vibrations of carbon nanotubes, quantum tunneling, auto-resonance and non-conventional synchronization. Besides the non-linear beating, the LPT concept allows one to find the conditions of transition from intense energy exchange to strongly localized (e.g. breather-like) excitations. A special mathematical technique based on the non- smooth temporal transformations leads to the clear and simple description of strongly modulated regimes. The role of LPTs in the theory of resonance non-stationary processes turns out to be similar to that of NNMs in stationary case. As an example we present results of analytical and numerical study of planar dynamics of a string with uniformly distributed discrete masses without a preliminary stretching. Each mass is also affected by grounding support with cubic characteristic (which is equivalent to transversal unstretched string). We consider the most important case of low-energy transversal dynamics. This example is especially instructive because the considered system cannot be linearized. Adequate analytical description of resonance non-stationary processes which correspond to intensive energy exchange between different parts of the system (clusters) in low frequency domain was obtained in terms of LPTs. We have revealed also in these terms the conditions of energy localization on the initially excited cluster. Analytical results are in agreement with the results of numerical simulations. It is shown that the considered system can be used as an efficient energy sink.},

The beams considered possess two degrees of freedom (dofs), a flexural motion as well as a traction/compression motion. In-plane deformations of the ring will be considered. Divergences and mode couplings have thus been underscored within the rotating frame and in order to simplify understanding of all these phenomena, the dofs of the beams will first be treated separately and then together. The dynamics of radial rotating loads on an elastic ring can create divergence instabilities as well as post-critical mode couplings. Moreover, the flexural motion of beam rubbing on the ring can also lead to mode couplings and to the locus-veering phenomenon. The presence of rubbing seems to make the system unstable as soon as the rotational speed of the beams is greater than zero. Lastly, the influence of an angle between the beams and the normal to the ring's inner surface will be studied with respect to system stability, thus highlighting a shift frequency phenomenon.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a model of fully flexible bladed rotor developed in the rotating frame. An energetic method is used to obtain the matrix equations of the dynamic behaviour of the system. The gyroscopic effects as well as the spin softening effects and the centrifugal stiffening effects, taken into account through a pre-stressed potential, are included in the model. In the rotating frame, the eigenvalues' imaginary parts of the latter matrix equation give the Campbell diagram of the system and its stability can be analysed through its associated eigenvalues' real parts. The turbo machine casing is also modelled by an elastic ring in the rotating frame through an energetic method. Thus, in some rotational speed ranges the contact problem between the rotor and the stator can be treated as a static problem since both structures are stationary to each other. Prior to the study of the complete problem of contact between the flexible blades of the rotor and the flexible casing, a simple model of an elastic ring having only one mode shape, excited by rotating loads is developed in the rotating frame too, in order to underline divergence instabilities and mode couplings. Then, the complete problem of frictionless sliding contact between the blades and the casing, without rubbing, is studied. The stable balanced static contact configurations of the structure are found as function of the rotational speed of the rotor. Finally, the results are compared to these of the simple model of rotating spring-masses on an elastic ring, showing good adequacy. The present model of rotor appears thus particularly adapted to the study of blades-casing contacts and highlighted an unstable phenomenon near the stator critical speed even in case of frictionless sliding.},

 abstract = {The main difference between a linear system and a nonlinear system is in the non-uniqueness of solutions manifested by the singular Jacobian matrix. It is important to be able to express the Jacobian accurately, completely, and efficiently in an algorithm to analyze a nonlinear system. For periodic response, the incremental harmonic balance (IHB) method is widely used. The existing IHB methods, however, requiring double summations to form the Jacobian matrix, are often extremely time-consuming when higher order harmonic terms are retained to fulfill the completeness requirement. A new algorithm to compute the Jacobian is to be introduced with the application of fast Fourier transforms (FFT) and Toeplitz formulation. The resulting Jacobian matrix is constructed explicitly by three vectors in terms of the current Fourier coefficients of response, depending respectively on the synchronizing mass, damping, and stiffness functions. The part of the Jacobian matrix depending on the nonlinear stiffness is actually a Toeplitz matrix. A Toeplitz matrix is a matrix whose k, r position depends only on their difference k-r. The other parts of the Jacobian matrix depending on the nonlinear mass and damping are Toeplitz matrices modified by diagonal matrices.

 abstract = {An impact damper is a freely moving mass, constrained by stops, located on a dynamic structural system to be controlled. As the system is excited, the impact mass moves relative to the structure resulting in impacts between the mass and the stops, transferring momentum from the structure to the impact mass, and dissipating energy as heat, noise and high frequency vibrations. At the point of impact, large accelerations are imparted to the structure, which may be undesirable, particularly for occupied structures. In order to reduce these high accelerations, it is proposed to incorporate a buffer region between the mass and the stop. Free and forced vibration tests of a system equipped with a buffered impact damper are used to study the resulting damping effect and impact characteristics. The performance of the buffered impact damper is compared with that of a conventional rigid impact damper. It is found that the buffered impact damper not only significantly reduces the accelerations, contact force and the associated noise generated by a collision but also enhances the level of vibration control. A possible reason for the enhanced control is postulated by examining impact behaviour. The investigation shows that the effective reduction of the vibration response depends not only on the magnitude of the contact force but also upon the contact time. $\backslash$textcopyright 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

 abstract = {The target of this paper is to employ autoresonant control technique to maintain the nonlinear oscillating mode at resonance (ultrasonic vibration at the tip of a drill bit at a desired level) during vibro-impact process. In order to achieve this, an autoresonant control system which intends to provide the possibility of self-tuning and self-adaptation mechanism for an ultrasonic vibrating system to maintain the resonant regime of oscillations automatically by means of positive feedback was developed and manufactured. The autoresonant control system was implemented through a `controlled variable' transformation and amplification. Three feedback control strategies were employed depending on the attributes of the `manipulated variables'. Mechanical feedback control uses the displacement signal at the end of an ultrasonic transducer. The other two control strategies are current feedback control and power feedback control. The current feedback control employs the current flowing through the piezoceramic rings as the `controlled variable' while power feedback control takes into account both current and power of an ultrasonic vibrating system. In order to investigate the tool effect on the established autoresonant control system, two sizes of drill bits with diameters 3mm and 6mm were employed in combination with three autoresonant control strategies. These were executed in drilling aluminium alloys 1050 with hardness 45HV with a fixed rotational speed combined with several feed rates. Controlled variables, responding variables, feed force reduction were monitored. Holes quality and surface finish examinations supplement the analysis of the efficiency of the control systems.},

For periodic excitation, the boundary between the regime with two impacts per cycle and that of strongly modulated response (SMR) is proved to be optimal rather than SMR. The chaotic SMR is experimentally observed from the viewpoint of displacement of LO. The above-observed mechanism is further applied to explain the optimization mechanism under transient excitation and that under periodic excitation with a range of frequency. It is experimentally verified that the optimization of the latter can be simplified to the optimization under an excitation with a single resonance frequency. For transient excitation, the efficiency of different transient response regimes is experimentally compared, which agrees with the periodic results. Moreover, the efficiency comparison of different lengths of cavity is also experimentally validated. In short, the close relation of optimization under different excitations is clearly demonstrated.},

The objective is to study response regimes and to compare their efficiency of vibration control. Through the analytical study with multiple scales method, two slow invariant manifolds (SIM) are obtained for two VI NES, and different SIM that result from different clearances analytically supports the principle of separate activation. In addition, fixed points are calculated and their positions are applied to judge response regimes. Transient responses and modulated responses can be further explained. By this way, all analysis is around the most efficient response regime. Then, numerical results demonstrate two typical responses and validate the effectiveness of analytical prediction. Finally, basic response regimes are experimentally observed and analyzed, and they can well explain the complicated variation of responses and their corresponding efficiency, not only for periodic excitations with a fixed frequency or a range of frequency, but also for transient excitation. Generally, vibration control is more effective when VI NES is activated with two impacts per cycle, whatever the types of excitation and the combinations of clearances. This observation is also well reflected by the separate activation of two VI NES with two different clearances, but at different levels of displacement amplitude of LO. {\copyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

It is theoretically proved and experimentally observed that this activation characteristic is almost independent of frequency, which provides direct proof for the effectiveness of VI NES in a broad frequency bandwidth. In terms of vibration control, this feature is very attractive and builds a bridge between linear and nonlinear systems. Then it is applied for the design of VI NES attached to nonlinear systems.

The Acoustic Black Hole (ABH) effect is a passive vibration mitigation technique, which has shown attractive properties above a given cut-on frequency. In this contribution, a vibro-impact acoustic black hole (VI-ABH) is introduced, the contact nonlinearity being used as a mean to transfer energy from low to high frequencies. A numerical model of a VI-ABH is derived from a Euler-Bernoulli beam. The contact law is handled with a penalization approach, the visco-elastic layer with a Ross-Kerwin-Ungard model and the problem is solved with a modal approach combined with an energy-conserving time integration scheme. Numerical results show that the VI-ABH brings about important modifications, and changes the nature of more traditional black holes, by redistributing all the vibrational energy. It can lead to a strong decrease of the resonance magnitude at low frequencies. Under steady state noise excitation, parametric studies are realised in the cases of a single contact, a grid of contacts and bilateral contacts layouts, in order to find some optimal designs. Transient dynamics is also studied through the analysis of displacement signal envelope and energy decay time. All the numerical results constantly show that the combination of the ABH effect and an energy transfer provided by contact nonlinearity leads to very attractive mitigation template including low frequencies.},

It usually consists of a local decrease of the structure thickness profile, associated to a thin viscoelastic coating placed in the area of minimum thickness. It has been shown that such structural design acts as an efficient vibration damper in the high frequency range, but not at low frequencies. This paper investigates how different types of vibration absorbers, linear and nonlinear, added to the primary system can improve the low frequency performance of a beam ABH termination. In particular, the conjugated effects of the Acoustic Black Hole effect and a Tuned Mass Damper (TMD), a Nonlinear Energy Sink (NES), a bi-stable NES (BNES), and a vibro-impact ABH (VI-ABH) are investigated. Forced response to random excitation are computed in the time domain using a modal approach combined with an energy conserving numerical scheme. Frequency indicators are defined to characterize and compare the performance of all solutions. The simulation results clearly show that all the proposed methods are able to damp efficiently the flexural vibrations in a broadband manner. The optimal tuning of each proposed solution is then investigated through a thorough parametric study, showing how to optimize the efficiency of each solution. In particular, TMD and VI-ABH show a slight dependence on vibration amplitude, while the performance of NES and BNES have a peak of efficiency for moderate amplitudes.},

from the classical transfer matrix-direct integral method rests

with the introduction of complex modal analysis corresponding

to positive and negative whirling frequencies, and after

obtaining the critical speed and the corresponding vibration

modes by the transfer coefficient method it is no longer

necessary to do transfer calculation ( but in classical transfer

matrix-direct integral method, after every integral step, it is

necessary to do a transfer calculation through the whole rotor

system). In the transfer coefficient-direct integral method,

corresponding every integral step it is only a linear

transformation between the real displacements and the modal

displacements. It makes the transfer calculation and the direct

integral become two independent steps of the calculation. Each

step fully takes advantages of the method correspondent. The

whole analysis procedure is then greatly simplified.

The paper gives, at first, the principle of the transfer

coefficient-direct integral method. After this, the transient

response of a co-axial double rotor system with a squeeze film

damper is calculated by the method. The response history of the

system from an initial time to stable state is given.},

that feature large, geometric deviations from a nominal design. Various finite-element-based

reduced-order models (ROMs) have been proposed in the literature for bladed disks with

small blade-to-blade differences, called mistuning. Many of these techniques rely on the fact

that mistuned-system normal modes can be effectively represented using a linear combination

of the normal modes of the nominal (tuned) system. However, when the mistuning or

geometric deviation is large, the number of tuned-system normal modes required to describe

the mistuned-system normal modes increases dramatically. In this work, a method for large

mistuning is formulated by employing a mode-acceleration method with static mode compensation.

By accounting for the effects of mistuning as though they were produced by external

forces, a set of basis vectors is established using a combination of tuned-system normal

modes compensated by static modes. The obtained basis vectors approximately span the space

of the mistuned-system modes without requiring a much more expensive modal analysis of

the mistuned system, and they provide much better convergence than tuned-system normal

modes. Furthermore, in order to extend the method to higher frequency ranges, quasi-static

modes, in which inertia effects are included, are employed in place of static modes in the modeacceleration

formulation. It is seen that ROMs based on the new technique are extremely compact,

Dynamic analysis is the basis in investigating vibration features of cracked blades, where the features can be applied to monitor health state of blades, detect cracks in an early stage and prevent failures. This work presents a cracked hexahedral finite element method for dynamic analysis of cracked blades, with the purpose of addressing the contradiction between accuracy and efficiency in crack modeling of blades in rotor system. The cracked hexahedral element is first derived with strain energy release rate method, where correction of stress intensity factors of crack front and formulation of load distribution of crack surface are carried out to improve the modeling accuracy. To consider nonlinear characteristics of time-varying opening and closure effects caused by alternating loads, breathing function is proposed for the cracked hexahedral element. Second, finite element method with contact element is analyzed and used for comparison. Finally, validation of the cracked hexahedral element is carried out in terms of breathing effects of cracked blades and natural frequency in different crack depths. Good consistency is acquired between the results with developed cracked hexahedral element and contact element, while the computation time is significantly reduced in the previous one. Therefore, the developed cracked hexahedral element achieves good accuracy and high efficiency in crack modeling of rotating blades.},

As important causes of fatigue and crack failure, alternating loads also affect vibration characteristics of cracked blades in rotor system and probably influence formulation of diagnostic rule. This work carried out analysis of nonlinear vibration of cracked blade in rotor system with crack breathing effects and alternating loads taken into account. Firstly, equations of motion are formed with Finite Element Method (FEM), and breathing crack is modeled with cracked hexahedral element (CHE) where the breathing behavior is load-dependent. Secondly, displacement responses of cracked blade are obtained, and the results with CHE and contact element are identical. The stiffness of the cracked blade is obtained with CHE and proved to be time-varying and dependent on the alternating loads. Thirdly, natural frequencies of cracked blade in stationary condition are analyzed including normal model, linear model (open crack) and nonlinear model (breathing crack), and the requirement of the inclusion of breathing effects in blades with fatigue crack is proved. Finally, influence of alternating loads on critical frequency of cracked blade in rotating condition is compared. The results show that the critical frequency is significantly affected due to the co-effects of the rotating speed and alternating loads. The proposed method can estimate nonlinear vibration characteristics of crack blade which is beneficial for the formulation of the diagnostic rule.},

A multi-harmonic balance method combined with the alternating frequency/time method (MHBM-AFT) is used to predict and further analyze the dynamic characteristics of the electromechanical system, and an arc-length continuation technique is used to improve the convergence of the method. In order to validate the algorithm as well as to recognize the characteristics of the system with SSDNC, a two degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) system with SSDNC is studied at first. The nonlinear complex modal information is calculated and compared with those of the corresponding system with a linear RL shunt circuit. The results indicate that the natural frequencies and modal damping ratio do not change with the modal amplitude, which means that SSDNC has the same modal damping corresponding to different system energy levels. In addition, SSDNC can improve the damping level of all the modes nearly without affecting the natural frequencies of the system. Then, the forced response of the blisk with SSDNC in the frequency domain is calculated and analyzed, including a tuned blisk, which is excited by the traveling wave excitation with a single harmonic and multi-harmonic, and a mistuned blisk, which is excited by traveling wave excitation with a single harmonic and multi-harmonic. We present two advantages of the SSDNC technique when compared with piezoelectric shunt damping. First, SSDNC can suppress the vibration of the blisk under a multi-harmonic wideband the traveling wave, and second, the vibration suppression performance of SSDNC is insensitive to the mistuning of mechanical parameters of the blisk. The results will be of great significance in overcoming the problem of the amplitude magnification induced by the inevitable mistuning of the blisk in aero-engines.},

The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is confirmed numerically for the case of a periodically excited, soft impact oscillator. Our analysis shows how path-following techniques for non-smooth systems can be used in order to determine the optimal control parameters in terms of energy expenditure due to the control signal and transient behavior of the control error, which can be applied to a broad range of engineering problems.},

 abstract = {The single-degree-of-freedom linear oscillator (LO) under the action of harmonic forcing is coupled to a light attachment that acts, in essence, as a nonlinear energy sink (NES). The complex dynamics of this two-degree-of-freedom system is investigated. Strong stiffness and damping nonlinearity in this system is introduced by coupling the LO and NES by two inclined linear spring-damper elements. The inclination of the coupling elements during the motion introduces strongly nonlinear geometric effects in the forced dynamics. A slow/fast partition of the dynamics is introduced by applying a complexification-averaging method, based on which a bifurcation analysis is performed. The effects of the initial angle, i.e., the initial inclination angle of the spring-damper elements, are thoroughly studied. The topology of the trajectories on the slow manifold of the dynamics is studied, and the different steady-state response regimes are predicted analytically. The conditions for existence of strongly modulated responses and of ``folding singularities'' are studied, and their effects on the nonlinear dynamical responses are revealed. Comparisons between analytical and numerical results indicate a good agreement between the two and provide a means of verification of the analytical findings. The analytical results show that, by increasing the initial angle of inclination, one can shrink, and even completely eliminate, unwanted high-amplitude steady-state responses of the LO that co-exist with desirable low-amplitude forced responses over definitive frequency ranges. This finding has significant practical implications for the vibration mitigation efficiency and robustness of the proposed NES, enhancing drastically the vibration suppression of the forced response of the LO. The presented results and the associated analytical modeling can be used to design and enhance the performance of nonlinear vibration absorbers as vibration mitigating devices.},

components or substructures, and the modelling, prediction and optimisation of the

assembled structures are presently achieving far from the required accuracy and

reliability, and from that which is attained for the individual components. This is the

essential problem addressed by this research.

The difficulties in achieving the required accuracy are almost certainly due to the

variety and complexity of joint types and to the lack of an accurate estimation of the

interactions between substructures. This thesis provides two approaches for joint

parameter identification, a least-squares method based and a neural network based

one. Their mathematical backgrounds are thoroughly presented and their validity is

examined by numerical case studies.

The coupling analysis method has the equal importance to the joint parameter

identification. Two branches of coupling methods, CMS and FRF-based, are

systematically investigated. Two new methods, one in each branch, are developed to

take joint effects into account in the analysis. Numerical studies show that these

methods are accurate and efficient. The significance of modal incompleteness and

measurement noise to the coupling analysis is also estimated.

Two relevant issues in joint modelling and substructure coupling are also discussed in

this thesis. They are (i) non-linearity considerations in joint modelling and

substructure coupling and (ii) impact of rotational DOF information. The former

reviews the progress of nonlinear joint modelling as well as the analysis methods

dealing with nonlinear coupling problem, indicating that the nonlinear behaviour of

fastening joints is not significant. The latter demonstrates the importance of the

RDOF-related information in both joint modelling and FRF coupling analysis.},

Backbone curves can offer valuable insight into the behaviour of nonlinear systems along with significant information about any coupling between the underlying linear modes in their response. This paper presents a technique for the extraction of backbone curves of lightly damped nonlinear systems that is well suited for the experimental investigation of structures exhibiting nonlinear behaviour. The approach is based on estimations of the instantaneous frequency and the envelope amplitude of a decaying response following a tuned steady-state oscillation of the system. Results obtained from simulations and experiments demonstrate that the proposed procedure is capable of achieving an accurate estimation of the backbone curves and damping ratios of the system provided that the premise of damping having low impact on its oscillation frequency is met.},

such a situation: the asymptotic extrapolation is used in the predictor phase of a continuation method

In this paper, both the transient and stationary nonlinear behaviors of the friction destabilized system and the effect of dynamical reduction on the nonlinear response of a simple friction destabilized system are carried out. The first part provides a description of the general modeling retained for friction destabilized systems. Then, discretization and solving processes for the stability analysis and the temporal evolution are presented. The third part presents an analysis of a sliding elastic layer for different operating conditions, in order to better understand the nonlinear behavior of such systems. Finally, spatial model reduction is performed with different kinds of reduction bases in order to analyze the different effects of modal reductions. This clearly shows the necessity of including static modes in the reduction basis and that nonlinear interactions between unstable modes are very difficult to represent with reduced bases.

It should be noted that the effective suppression of structural vibration is conducive to enhancing machine performance, prolonging the service life of devices, and promoting the safety and comfort of structures. Conventional linear energy dissipative devices (linear dampers) are largely restricted for wider application owing to their low performance under certain conditions, such as the detuning effect of tuned mass dampers subjected to nonstationary excitations and the excessively large forces generated in linear viscous dampers at high velocities. Recently, nonlinear energy dissipative devices (nonlinear dampers) with broadband response and high robustness are being increasingly used in practical engineering. At the present stage, nonlinear dampers can be classified into three groups, namely nonlinear stiffness dampers, nonlinear-stiffness nonlinear-damping dampers, and nonlinear damping dampers. Corresponding to each nonlinear group, three types of nonlinear dampers that are widely utilized in practical engineering are reviewed in this paper: the nonlinear energy sink (NES), particle impact damper (PID), and nonlinear viscous damper (NVD), respectively. The basic concepts, research status, engineering applications, and design approaches of these three types of nonlinear dampers are summarized. A comparison between their advantages and disadvantages in practical engineering applications is also conducted, to provide a reference source for practical applications and new research.},

The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of particle damping technology, beginning with its basic concept, developmental history, and research status all over the world. Furthermore, various interpretations of the underlying damping mechanism are introduced and discussed in detail. The theoretical analysis and numerical simulation, together with their pros and cons are systematically expounded, in which a discrete element method of simulating a multi-degree-of-freedom structure with a particle damper system is illustrated. Moreover, on the basis of previous studies, a simplified method to analyze the complicated nonlinear particle damping is proposed, in which all particles are modeled as a single mass, thereby simplifying its use by practicing engineers. In order to broaden the applicability of particle dampers, it is necessary to implement the coupled algorithm of finite element method and discrete element method. In addition, the characteristics of experimental studies on particle damping are also summarized. Finally, the application of particle damping technology in the aerospace field, machinery field, lifeline engineering, and civil engineering is reviewed at length. As a new trend in structural vibration control, the application of particle damping in civil engineering is just at the beginning. The advantages and potential applications are demonstrated, whereas the difficulties and deficiencies in the present studies are also discussed. The paper concludes by suggesting future developments involving semi-active approaches that can enhance the effectiveness of particle dampers when used in conjunction with structures subjected to nonstationary excitation, such as earthquakes and similar nonstationary random excitations.},

The double objective of this numerical study is, first, to determine which bases are most adequate for a given combination of nonlinearity and excitation and, second, to which extend the bases exhibit an inherent robustness if the parameterisation of the excitation is changed. A specific multicriteria decision analysis score is developed to assess the bases' performance. As a major result, a strong dependence of the performance of the bases on the type of excitation is established and thus some bases become more adequate for a certain situation than others. Also a lack of robustness for all considered bases can be observed. This situation improves in most cases if the basis is generated with the most critical values of the parameter. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {As a novel dynamic vibration absorber, the nonlinear energy sink has been studied for mitigating structural and mechanical vibration through the last decade. This paper presents a series of large-scale experimental evaluations and numerical simulations on a system of nonlinear energy sink (NES) devices for mitigating seismic structural responses. Two distinct types of NES devices were installed in the top two floors of a large-scale model building structure. In the device system, four Type I NESs employing smooth essentially nonlinear restoring forces were used in conjunction with two single-sided vibro-impact (SSVI) NESs employing non-smooth impact nonlinearities. These NES devices utilize the existing structural mass and space of the model building to realize an integrated design of building structure with non-parasitic control devices. Scaled historic earthquake ground motions were implemented by a large-scale shake table as the base excitation input into the system. Direct comparisons between mitigated and unmitigated structural responses, including story displacement, column strain and base shear force, demonstrate that rapid mitigation of structural responses was achieved by the system of devices. Reductions of both peak and average values of structural responses were clearly observed. The synergistic effects obtained by simultaneously using two types of NES devices were demonstrated. To computationally investigate the mitigation performance of the devices subjected to a wide variety of ground motions, a numerical model was developed for the structure-NES system and two suites of earthquake ground motions representing distinct earthquake intensities were employed. Simulation results demonstrate that mitigation of structural responses caused by diverse earthquake ground motions can be achieved by a system of NES devices.},

 abstract = {This study presents a direct comparison of measured and predicted nonlinear vibrations of a clamped--clamped steel beam with non-ideal boundary conditions. A multi-harmonic comparison of simulations with measurements is performed in the vicinity of the primary resonance. First of all, a nonlinear analytical model of the beam is developed taking into account non-ideal boundary conditions. Three simulation methods are implemented to investigate the nonlinear behavior of the clamped--clamped beam. The method of multiple scales is used to compute an analytical expression of the frequency response which enables an easy updating of the model. Then, two numerical methods, the Harmonic Balance Method and a time-integration method with shooting algorithm, are employed and compared one with each other. The Harmonic Balance Method enables to simulate the vibrational stationary response of a nonlinear system projected on several harmonics. This study then proposes a method to compare numerical simulations with measurements of all these harmonics. A signal analysis tool is developed to extract the system harmonics' frequency responses from the temporal signal of a swept sine experiment. An evolutionary updating algorithm (Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy), coupled with highly selective filters is used to identify both fundamental frequency and harmonic amplitudes in the temporal signal, at every moment. This tool enables to extract the harmonic amplitudes of the output signal as well as the input signal. The input of the Harmonic Balance Method can then be either an ideal mono-harmonic signal or a multi-harmonic experimental signal. Finally, the present work focuses on the comparison of experimental and simulated results. From experimental output harmonics and numerical simulations, it is shown that it is possible to distinguish the nonlinearities of the clamped--clamped beam and the effect of the non-ideal input signal.},

 abstract = {Martin Marietta is developing a shape memory material actuator to provide active vibration and shape control for large, adaptive space structures. An important facet of this work is the development of analytical modeling capabilities for shape memory material behavior. These alloys exhibit a very interdependent force-length-temperature (FLT) response, which must be understood to best exploit their behavior for the efficient and timely conversion of heat into mechanical work. Also, the modal response of large, flexible space structures will be affected by the use of inherently non-linear, hysteretic shape memory actuators, and specialized control methodologies need to be developed specific to this application. In this work, Cory and McNichols' theory of non-equilibrium thermostatics (NET) was modified to account for the multiple quadrant (i.e., tension and compression) hysteretic behavior of shape memory alloys. Experimental results were used to provide the basis for spatial mapping of the austenite-to-martensite (AM) and martensite-to-austenite (MA) phase transformation boundaries, along with the relative locations of the 100{\%} austenite (Z A) and 100{\%} aligned martensite (Z M) saturation surfaces in the three-dimensional FLT material behavior domain. A Fortran subroutine, describing the shape memory material actuator, was incorporated into dynamic analyses of a simplified finite element model based on the Spacecraft Control Laboratory Experiment (SCOLE) structure. A slewing maneuver of 20 degrees in 12 seconds was used to study a number of cases for the shape memory actuator which utilized a biasing force (e.g., the biasing effect of a matrix in a strain-compliant shape memory composite) acting against 150 NiTi wires (0.5 mm dia. by 0.50 m in length). Temperature was used as the command variable to demonstrate active vibration control during and after the slew maneuver. Significant passive damping was noted, in addition to effective active control when the actuator's temperature was pulsed. This analytic 'test bed' will provide critical insight into the design and analysis of smart, adaptive shape memory space truss tubes and actuators for vibration and shape control, as well as the vehicle by which future shape memory actuator control algorithms and methodologies can be assessed.},

We follow the extended Hamilton principle in order to derive the equation of motion describing the vertical vibrations of the moving magnet while taking into account the geometric and magnetic nonlinearities. The Galerkin discretization procedure was used in order to transform the mutiphysics continuum problem into a finite system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations in time domain. Since we are interested in the response of the harvester at resonance when the first bending mode is dominant, the model is reduced to a single degree of freedom and solved analytically using a perturbation technique and numerically by the harmonic balance method coupled with the asymptotic numerical continuation technique.

Nonlinear Hill's equations model a variety of dynamical systems of interest to physics and engineering, in which perturbations enter as periodic modulations of their linear frequencies. As is well known, the stability properties of some fundamental periodic solutions of these systems is often an essential problem. The main purpose of this paper is to concentrate on one such class of nonlinear Hill's equations and study the stability properties of some of their simplest periodic solutions analytically as well as numerically. To accomplish this task, we first use an extension of the generalized averaging method to approximate these solutions and then apply the technique of multiple scaling to perform the stability analysis. A three-particle system with free-free boundary conditions is studied as an example. The accuracy of our results is tested, within the limits of first-order perturbation theory, and is found to be well confirmed by numerical experiments. The stability analysis of these simple periodic solutions, though local in itself, can yield considerable information about more global properties of the dynamics, since it is in the vicinity of such solutions that the largest regions of regular or chaotic motion are usually observed, depending on whether the periodic solution is, respectively, stable or unstable.},

This paper presents general formulations for natural frequencies and mode shapes with all non-linearity effects. Initially the non-linear system with general boundary conditions is discretized, and using a two-dimensional manifold, the model of cubic non-linearities is constructed and the general equation of motion which governs non-linear system is derived. The method of multiple scales is then used to extend the non-linear mode shapes and natural frequencies. During this analysis, it is realized that when the natural frequencies of the linear system become equal to the natural frequencies of the non-linear system a one-to-one internal resonance will appear. Also, there is a three-to-one internal resonance which is not dependent on the damping of the system. Finally, general formulations of amplitude for vibrations, natural frequencies and mode shapes of the non-linear system are obtained in parametric forms. Thus, a non-linear problem with some simple integration can be solved.

@phdthesis{maki2004,
 abstract = {In this thesis, a general formulation for flexible multibody mechanics is given. Since multibody systems are

highly constrained, the examination of differential geometry is necessary to understand the internal geometry

and kinematics of general multibody systems. Therefore, the formulation is given in the language of

differential geometry: manifolds, tangent spaces and tangent tensors on manifolds, push-forward and pullback

operators, metric tensors, etc.



The rotation manifold, whose elements are rotation operators, is thoroughly investigated. This study probably

provides the most important contribution of the thesis: material incremental rotation vectors, material

angular velocity vectors, and material angular acceleration vectors belong to the different tangent spaces of

the rotation manifold. Hence, the direct application of the material incremental rotation vector with standard

time integration methods yields serious problems: adding quantities which belong to the different tangent

spaces.



The formulation is applied to Reissner's geometrically exact beam theory, giving a new geometrically exact

beam element that is based on the total Lagrangian updating procedure. The element has the total rotation

vector as the unknown variable and the singularity problems at the rotation angle 2{\_} and its multiples are

handled by the change of parametrization on the rotation manifold. The consistent stiffness, gyroscopic,

centrifugal, and loading tensors of the total Lagrangian formulation are given explicitly. The total Lagrangian

formulation has several benefits such as all unknown variable vectors belong to the same tangent space,

no need for secondary storage variables, the path-independence property (in the static case), any standard

time integration algorithm may be used, the symmetric stiffness tensor, a simple form of the kinetic energy

and all nonlinear effects are included.



In addition, the formulation is applied to parametrize the constraint manifold that arises from point-wise

holonomic constraint equations. The constraint manifold parametrization, using the total Lagrangian formulation,

has several benefits: the minimal number of variables, objective formulation, no need for secondary

storage variables, constraint equations are satisfied automatically, the resulting equations of motion are

ordinary differential equations (not differential-algebraic), and easy to apply time-dependent boundary conditions.

The constraint manifold parametrization is particularly competitive in the flexible multibody system

where the number of degrees of freedom is extensive comparing with the number of constraint equations.

Moreover, special beam elements, which involve holonomic constraints, are also derived as the examples of

the formulation. These elements can be exploited as customary elements in the finite element method.},

The influence of a hysteretic damper on the airfoil flutter instability is investigated. In particular, its effect on the post-critical limit cycle oscillations (LCOs) is emphasized. For that purpose, an aeroelastic model including large amplitude motions and dynamic stall phenomenon, is considered for a rigid flat plate having two degrees of freedom in pitch and plunge motions. The hysteretic behaviour is modeled thanks to a generalized Bouc-Wen formulation. A parametric study of aeroelastic as well as hysteresis model parameters, allows one to draw a complete picture of the bifurcation scenario, highlighting the capacity of the hysteretic damper in precluding the occurrence of stall. The special case of shape memory alloy (SMA) springs is then used numerically and experimentally for controlling the flutter oscillations of a flat plate. The study reveals the ability of the SMA springs to drastically reduce the amplitudes of the LCOs caused by the flutter instability.},

The effect of including these components is then investigated by comparing the impulse responses from the Volterra expressions to the impulse response of a simulated single degree of freedom Duffing oscillator system.

@article{maqu2008,
 abstract = {In this study, the effect of the centrifugal forces on the eigenvalue solution obtained using two different nonlinear finite element formulations is examined. Both formulations can correctly describe arbitrary rigid body displacements and can be used in the large deformation analysis. The first formulation is based on the geometrically exact beam theory, which assumes that the cross section does not deform in its own plane and remains plane after deformation. The second formulation, the absolute nodal coordinate formulation (ANCF), relaxes this assumption and introduces modes that couple the deformation of the cross section and the axial and bending deformations. In the absolute nodal coordinate formulation, four different models are developed; a beam model based on a general continuum mechanics approach, a beam model based on an elastic line approach, a beam model based on an elastic line approach combined with the Hellinger--Reissner principle, and a plate model based on a general continuum mechanics approach. The use of the general continuum mechanics approach leads to a model that includes the ANCF coupled deformation modes. Because of these modes, the continuum mechanics model differs from the models based on the elastic line approach. In both the geometrically exact beam and the absolute nodal coordinate formulations, the centrifugal forces are formulated in terms of the element nodal coordinates. The effect of the centrifugal forces on the flap and lag modes of the rotating beam is examined, and the results obtained using the two formulations are compared for different values of the beam angular velocity. The numerical comparative study presented in this investigation shows that when the effect of some ANCF coupled deformation modes is neglected, the eigenvalue solutions obtained using the geometrically exact beam and the absolute nodal coordinate formulations are in a good agreement. The results also show that as the effect of the centrifugal forces, which tend to increase the beam stiffness, increases, the effect of the ANCF coupled deformation modes on the computed eigenvalues becomes less significant. It is shown in this paper that when the effect of the Poisson ration is neglected, the eigenvalue solution obtained using the absolute nodal coordinate formulation based on a general continuum mechanics approach is in a good agreement with the solution obtained using the geometrically exact beam model.},

Starting from the perspective of nonlinearities as internal feedback forces, a method in the time domain for the identification of nonlinear vibrating structures is described. Although its formulation is very simple, particular care has to be taken to reduce the ill-conditioning of the problem, in order to find numerically stable solutions. To this purpose the robustness and the high numerical performances of the subspace algorithms are successfully exploited, as demonstrated by the implementation of the method on simulated data from single and multi-degree of freedom systems with typical nonlinear characteristics. The method allows to estimate the coefficients of the nonlinearities away from the location of the applied excitations and also to identify the linear dynamic compliance matrix when the number of excitations is smaller than the number of response locations. The results comparison reported in this paper highlights the key advantage of the proposed method: the capability of treating multi-degree of freedom nonlinear systems holding different types of nonlinearities and the capability of selecting non-negligible nonlinear terms, with a light computational effort and with a limited number of time samples.},

@article{mari2011,
 abstract = {Predicting the influence of cracks on the dynamics of bladed disks is a very important

challenge. Cracks change the structural response, which in turn changes the crack

propagation characteristics. Hence, accurate and computationally effective means to

model the dynamics of cracked bladed disks and blisks is particularly crucial in applications

such as prognosis, guidance for repairs, characterization after repairs, design,

and structural health monitoring. Most current models of bladed disks exploit cyclic

symmetry to gain computational efficiency. However, the presence of cracks and mistuning

destroys that symmetry and makes computational predictions much more expensive.

In this work, we propose a new reduced order modeling methodology that can speed up

computations by several orders of magnitude. There are two key components of the new

methodology. First, the displacements and deformations of the crack surfaces are not

modeled in absolute coordinates but relative coordinates, which allows for an effective

model reduction based on (fixed-interface Craig--Bampton) component mode synthesis

(CMS). The use of relative coordinates allows one to define one of the components in

CMS as the pristine/uncracked structure (with mistuning). This approach is used in

combination with a set of accurate approximations for the constraint modes used in CMS.

Second, the effects of mistuning are captured by component mode mistuning, which

allows the construction of extremely efficient reduced order models for the pristine/

uncracked component with mistuning. The novel proposed method is applied to a finite

element model of an industrial blisk. The combined presence of mistuning and cracks is

shown to have important effects. Also, the proposed approach is shown to provide accurate

predictions for the overall blisk while requiring computations using single-sector

models only. The influence of various parameters on the accuracy of the reduced order

models is investigated. Overall, the results show a very good agreement between full

finite element analyses and the proposed reduced order modeling approach.},

This research investigates second harmonic generation in Rayleigh surface waves propagating in 9{\%}Cr ferritic martensitic steel. Previous experimental results show that nonlinear ultrasound is sensitive to certain microstructural changes in materials such as those due to thermal embrittlement and precipitation hardening. This research measures the ultrasonic nonlinearity parameter as an indicator of microstructural changes due to thermal aging in 9{\%}Cr ferritic martensitic steel specimens. The specimens are isothermally aged for different holding periods to induce progressive changes in the microstructure and to obtain different levels of thermal damage. As thermal aging progresses, the existing dislocations are annihilated in the beginning and precipitates are formed; these microstructural evolutions lead to large changes in the measured nonlinearity parameter, \textgreek{b}. Nonlinear ultrasonic experiments are conducted for each specimen using a wedge transducer for generation and an air-coupled transducer for detection of Rayleigh surface waves. The amplitudes of the first and second order harmonics are measured as a function of propagation distance, and these amplitudes are used to obtain the relative nonlinearity parameter at different aging stages. A possible scenario for the microstructural evolution during thermal aging is proposed based on the results from the nonlinear ultrasonic measurements, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Rockwell HRC hardness. These results indicate a clear trend that the measured nonlinearity parameter is sensitive to variations in dislocation and precipitate density, and thus can be useful in tracking microstructural changes in this material during thermal aging.},

This slow time modulation over the purely elastic oscillation is due to both the small aerodynamic effects and the small nonlinear friction forces. The correct computation of these two small effects is crucial to determine the final amplitude of the flutter vibration, which basically results from its balance. In this work, we apply asymptotic techniques to consistently derive, from a bladed-disk model, a reduced order model that gives only the time evolution on the slow modulation, filtering out the fast elastic oscillation. This reduced model is numerically integrated with very low computational cost, and we quantitatively compare its results with those from the bladed-disk model. The analysis of the friction saturation of the flutter instability also allows us to conclude that: (i) the final states are always nonlinearly saturated TW; (ii) depending on the initial conditions, there are several different nonlinear TWs that can end up being a final state; and (iii) the possible final TWs are only the more flutter prone ones.},

 abstract = {The final vibration amplitude of a turbomachinery bladed disk is of extreme practical importance; it is required to estimate the blade high cycle fatigue levels, and its operative life span. The computation of the final amplitude of the limit cycle oscillation requires to solve a complicated nonlinear problem that comes basically from the balance of the external forcing and the nonlinear damping introduced by the friction forces at the interfaces between blade and disk. In the case of a tuned bladed disk, it can be reduced to a single sector calculation with phase lag boundary conditions. If the small differences among blades (mistuning) are also taken into account, then the situation becomes more complicated; the solution of the mistuned vibration problem requires to consider the complete bladed disk. The possibility of applying multiple scales techniques to drastically simplify this problem is explored in this paper. The idea is to exploit the fact that all relevant effects present (forcing, nonlinear friction, and mistuning) are, in most practical situations, small effects that develop in a much longer time scale than that associated with the natural elastic vibration frequency of the tuned system. A mass-spring model with microslip nonlinear friction is used to represent the forced bladed disk. The multiple scales method is used to asymptotically derive simplified models for both tuned and mistuned configurations; the results are compared with those from the mass-spring system, and used to analyze  the nonlinear friction effects on the final vibration states.},

For general systems the statistical characteristics such as the probability density function (pdf) may be difficult to calculate. In addition to numerical simulation methods (Monte Carlo Simulations, MCS) there are differential equations for the pdf that can be solved to obtain such characteristics, most prominently the Fokker--Planck equation (FPE).



A variety of different approaches for solving FPEs for nonlinear systems have been investigated in the last decades. Most of these are limited to considerably low dimensions to avoid high numerical costs due to the ``curse of dimension''. Problems of higher dimension, such as d=6, have been solved only rarely.

 abstract = {The theoretical methodology, conceptual demonstration, and validation of a fully automated computer program for the inverse design and optimization of internal convectively cooled three-dimensional axial gas turbine blades is presented. A parametric computer model of the three-dimensional internal cooling network was developed, including the automatic generation of computational grids. A boundary element computer program was written to solve the steady-state, nonlinear heat conduction equation inside the internally cooled and thermal barrier coated turbine blade. A finite element algorithm was written to model an arbitrary network of internal coolant passages for the calculation of the internal pressure losses, flow rates, effects of centrifugal pumping, heating of the coolant fluid, and heat transfer coefficients from the thermal model of the solid to the coolant fluid. The heat conduction and internal flow analyses were strongly and iteratively coupled to account for the heat balance between the blade and the coolant fluid. A system of evolutionary optimization algorithms was used to modify the internal cooling configuration and internal heat transfer enhancements (boundary-layer trip strips and pedestals) to achieve the objectives of increased cooling effectiveness and greater durability against oxidation, corrosion, and creep. The computer-automated design and optimization system was demonstrated on the second high-pressure turbine blade row of the Pratt and Whitney F100 engine. The internal cooling optimization on the product definition of this blade yielded a 5{\%} increase in average cooling effectiveness, with only a marginal increase in coolant flow rate, in addition to having the same corrosion life and a doubling of the creep life.},

 abstract = {The efficient dynamic stress assessment of turbine blades is of prime importance in turbomachinery design. An accurate prediction of forced response level of shrouded blades requires a very detailed finite element model in addition to a nonlinear solver. In order to perform nonlinear forced response analysis of blades at an affordable computational cost, applying a model order reduction technique is essential. The appeal for component mode synthesis methods in dimension reduction of structures with friction contacts is due to the possibility of retaining a subset of physical degrees of freedom (e.g. the contact degrees of freedom) in the set of generalized coordinates. In this paper, a reduction method recently developed for nonlinear forced response analysis of structures with local nonlinearity is evaluated and compared with two classical component mode synthesis reduction techniques. All three methods have the same projection basis, which includes residual flexibility attachment modes and free interface modes, but different implementation. The response is computed in the frequency domain using multiharmonic balance method and periodic contact forces are modeled with a node-to-node 3D friction contact model. In order to demonstrate the efficiency of the three formulations, a rod and a simplified shrouded turbine blade are considered as case studies.},

The hysteretic behavior of the elements are described by the Masing model. Since attention is focused on the periodic response, the multi-component harmonic balance method is used to evaluate the solution. This method, combined with a path-following algorithm, is a robust tool capable of accurately describing the frequency response curves, which are particularly complex in some frequency range due to the strong non-linearities and non-linear modal coupling. The influence of hysteretic law parameters is investigated, and, in particular, the ratio between the two natural frequencies. It is shown that the coupling is very notable not only for the system in internal resonance condition 1:3, but also for the system with a ratio between the two natural frequencies in a large range around 3. The frequency response curves exhibit generally a number of resonance peaks greater than the number of degrees-of-freedom. The description of the oscillation shape at resonances is likely to furnish a complete picture of the response of the systems.},

The dynamic characteristics of the device are evaluated by the steady-state response at the resonance point in order to focus on the damping effect. Dynamic analysis utilizing the equivalent linearization approach results in two major findings that, to the best of the authors' knowledge, have not yet been reported in the literature. These results which characterize the unique behavior of the SMA hysteresis include: (a) for a given excitation amplitude, the {\textquotedbl}scale{\textquotedbl} of the hysteresis loop, which is a measure of displacement and restoring force, needs to be adjusted so that the response sweeps the maximum loop but does not exceed it; (b) the ratio of the area confined within the hysteresis loop to the area of a corresponding envelope of triangular shape should be as large as possible.

Ideally, the assembled system should perform as if the connections between the components were perfect, that is, as if the system were a single monolithic piece. However, the fasteners used in those connections, such as mechanical lap joints, are imperfect and highly nonlinear. In particular, these jointed connections dissipate energy, often through friction over highly localized microscale regions near connection points, and are known to exhibit history dependent, or hysteretic behavior. As a result, while mechanical joints are one of the most common elements in structural dynamics problems, their presence implies that assembled structural systems are difficult to model and analyze. Through rigorous experimental, analytical, and numerical work over the past century, researchers from several different disciplines have developed numerous damping models that give rise to the dynamical behavior attributed to joints. This work seeks to review, compare, and contrast several linear and nonlinear damping models that are known to be relevant to modeling assembled structural systems. These models are presented and categorized to place them in the proper historical and mathematical context as well as presenting numerous examples of their applications. General properties of hysteretic friction damping models are also studied and compared analytically. Connections are drawn between the different models so as to not only identify differences between models, but also highlight commonalities not normally seen to be in association.},

 abstract = {Some initial investigations have been published which simulate nonlinear response with almost traditional modal models: instead of connecting the modal mass to ground through the traditional spring and damper, a nonlinear Iwan element was added. This assumes that the mode shapes do not change with amplitude and there are no interactions between modal degrees of freedom. This work expands on these previous studies. An impact experiment is performed on a structure which exhibits typical structural dynamic nonlinear response, i.e. weak frequency dependence and strong damping dependence on the amplitude of vibration. Use of low level modal test results in combination with high level impacts are processed using various combinations of modal filtering, the Hilbert Transform and band-pass filtering to develop response data that are then fit with various nonlinear elements to create a nonlinear pseudo-modal model. Simulations of forced response are compared with high level experimental data for various nonlinear element assumptions.},

 abstract = {The primary goal of the this paper is to summarize field demonstrations of the feasibility of detecting changes in blade and shaft natural frequencies (such as those associated with a blade or shaft crack) on operating machinery using non-contact, non- intrusive measurement methods. Laboratory demonstration of feasibility and some special signal processing issues were addressed in Parts 1 and 2 [1, 2]. Part 3 primarily addresses the results of application of this non-intrusive torsional vibration sensing to: a large wind tunnel fan; a jet engine high-pressure disk; a hydro station turbine; and to a large coal- fired power plant induced-draft (ID) fan motors. During the operation of rotating equipment, torsional natural frequencies are excited by turbulence, friction, and other random forces. Laboratory testing was conducted to affirm the potential of this method for diagnostics and prognostics of blade and shafting systems. Field installation at the NASA Ames National Full-Scale Aerodynamic Facility (NFAC) reaffirmed the ability to detect both shaft and blade modes. Installation on a high-pressure (HP) disk in a jet engine test cell at General Electric Aircraft Engines demonstrated that the fundamental mode of the turbine blades was clearly visible during operation. Field installation at a hydro power station demonstrated that the first few shaft natural frequencies were visible, and correlated well with finite element results. Finally, field installation on the ID fan motors also showed the first few shaft torsional modes. These field tests have resulted in high confidence in the feasibility of the application of this technique for diagnosing and tracking shaft and blade cracks in operating machinery.},

The method is based on the generation of a data base of unsteady aerodynamic forces arising from the motion of arbitrary modes and uses least square approximations for the prediction of any responding mode. The use of a reduced order technique allows for mistuning analyses and is also applied for the selection of a limited number of arbitrary modes. The application of this method on a transonic compressor blade shows that the method captures the aeroelastic properties well in a wide frequency range.

These units have one high-pressure turbine and two tandem-compound low-pressure turbines with 44-in. last-stage blades. The blades that failed were in a low pressure (LP) turbine connected to the high pressure turbine (LP1) and in LP turbine connected to the generator (LP2). The failed blades had cracks in their roots initiating at the trailing edge, concave side of the steeple outermost fillet radius. Laboratory evaluation of the cracking indicates the failure mechanism to be high cycle fatigue (HCF). The last-stage blades failure evaluation was carried out. The investigation included a metallographic analysis of the cracked blades, natural frequency test and analysis, blade stress analysis, unit's operation parameters and history of events analysis, fracture mechanics and crack propagation analysis. This paper provides an overview of this failure investigation, which led to the identification of the blades torsional vibrations near 120 Hz and some operation periods with low load low vacuum as the primary contribution to the observed failure. {\copyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

To enable the development of robust fault detection methods, this work explores the deterministic as well as variational characteristics of failure signatures. Specifically, we explore the combined impact of crack damage and manufacturing variation on the vibrational characteristics of turbine blades modeled as pinned-pinned beams. The changes in the transverse vibration and associated eigenfrequencies of the beams are considered. Specifically, a complete variational beam vibration model is developed and presented that allows variations in geometry and material properties to be considered, with and without crack damage. To simplify variational simulation, separation of variables is used for fast simulations. This formulation is presented in detail. To establish a baseline of the effect of geometric variations on the system vibrational response, a complete numerical example is presented that includes damaged beams of ideal geometry and damaged beams with geometric variation. It is shown that changes in fault detection monitoring signals caused by geometric variation are small with those caused by damage and impending failure. Also, en combined, the impact of geometric variation and damage appear to be independent. Copyright {\copyright} 2005 by ASME.},

 abstract = {Observations related to the formation and growth of small cracks ranging from subgrain dimension up to the order of 1 mm are summarized for amplitudes ranging from low cycle fatigue (LCF) to high cycle fatigue (HCF) conditions for polycrystalline metals. Further efforts to improve the accuracy of life estimation which address LCF, HCF and LCF-HCF interactions must consider various factors that are not presently addressed by conventional elastic-plastic fracture mechanics (EPFM) or linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) approaches based on long, self-similar cracks in homogeneous, isotropic materials, nor by conventional HCF design tools such as the $\in$-N curve, the S-N curve, modified Goodman diagram and fatigue limit. Development of microstructure-sensitive fatigue crack propagation relations relies on deeper understanding of small crack behavior, including (a) interactions with microstructure and lack of constraint for micro structurally small cracks, (b) heterogeneity and anisotropy of cyclic slip processes associated with the orientation distribution of grains, and (c) local mode mixity effects on small crack growth. The basic technology is not yet sufficiently advanced in these areas to implement robust damage tolerant design for HCF. This paper introduces an engineering model which approximates the results of slip transfer calculations related to crack blockage by microstructure barriers; the model is consistent with critical plane concepts for Stage I growth of small cracks, standard cyclic stress-strain and strain-life equations above threshold, and the Kitagawa diagram for HCF threshold behaviors. It is able to correlate the most relevant trends of small crack growth behavior, including crack arrest at the fatigue limit, load sequence effects, and stress state effects. {\copyright} 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

 abstract = {This paper demonstrates the accuracy of the nonlinear frequency domain method in applications to unsteady flow calculations. The basis of the method is a pseudospectral approach to recast a nonlinear unsteady system of equations in the temporal domain into a stationary system in the frequency domain. The nonlinear frequency domain method, in principle, provides the rapid convergence of a spectral method with increasing numbers of modes, and, in this sense, it is an optimal scheme for time-periodic problems. In practice it can also be effectively used as a reduced order method in which users deliberately choose not to resolve temporal modes in the solution. A variable-time-period method has been proposed such that the nonlinear frequency domain method can be applied to problems where the time period of the unsteadiness is either known or unknown a priori. To validate the latter case, results from this method have been compared with experimental results of vortex shedding in low Reynolds number flows past cylinders. Validation of the first case utilizes experimental data of a pitching airfoil in transonic flow. These comparisons demonstrate the efficiency of the nonlinear frequency domain method in representing complex nonlinear flow field physics with a limited number of temporal modes.},

Equations for the bounding frequencies of these zones are obtained in terms of the receptance matrices of the elements of multi-coupled systems. The relationship between these frequencies and the natural frequencies of a single element of the system is considered, particular attention being given to elements which are symmetrical. The nature of the characteristic wave motions is studied, and a characteristic receptance matrix for a characteristic wave is defined. This is used to introduce the study of reflection of a characteristic wave from a boundary. The equations governing the reflection process are set up, and used to formulate the equations for the natural frequencies and modes of a finite periodic system with arbitrary boundaries. The modes are represented by superpositions of opposite-going pairs of characteristic waves, in terms of which a simple physical description of the natural wave motion is presented. Undamped systems are considered initially, but it is then shown that all the equations so derived for free wave motion are applicable to the damped forced motion of hysteretically damped multi-coupled systems. The bounding frequencies and loss factors of purely propagating damped forced wave motion are considered in relation to the resonant frequencies and loss factors of the damped forced normal modes of a single element.

The study is further extended to account for the effect of the skew angle and the interfacial friction between the disc and attached blades upon the resulting contact stresses at the interface and through the disc thickness. The results reveal that aeroengine disc designers must treat the two-dimensional finite element results with caution. This is due to the fact that two-dimensional results do not account for the large stress variations at the contact region and through the thickness due to the presence of skew slots in the disc.},

@phdthesis{mehd1991,
 abstract = {This thesis is concerned with the flexural vibration of rotating discs and bladed discs. The

preliminary part explores and unifies the definitions of different terms which have been

used by previous workers in this subject. For harmonic excitation of a rotating disc, the

general response of double modes is investigated. It is shown that there is more than one

frequency component in the response. Also, the relationship are obtained between the

frequencies of response and resonances, the disc rotation speed and the number of nodal

diameters due to a given excitation.



A major part of the thesis reports the development of a practical simulation of vibration in

a disc rotating past a static force. This kind of excitation occurs in practice due to nonuniformity

of the pressure distribution on either side of a rotating disc but it is difficult to

reproduce under laboratory conditions. It is shown that each mode of vibration can be

excited in a stationary disc using two harmonic forces having certain spatial and temporal

phase angles. For this simulation, a dual-sine excitation technique has been developed

which may also be used for modal analysis of a disc or any axi-symmetric structure.

There are close modes and even coincidences of natural frequencies of the modes in axisymmetric

structures which are often difficult to distinguish in normal experimental

methods. These modes can be isolated and identified using the dual-sine excitation

method.



The dual-sine excitation technique has been examined for different systems and excitation

sets in terms of complex modes, mistuned systems and also different spatial and temporal

phase angles for the exciters to see how widely the procedure can be applied in real

situations. A discrete mass model of a disc has been considered and different cases have

been simulated using this model. On the experimental side, a phase and amplitude shifter

has been developed for use in the dual-sine excitation method. Its input is a sinusoidal

signal from the generator and its output is two sinusoidal signals with controlled relative

amplitudes and phase angles.



A method is presented for displaying and interpreting the response in the vibrating disc.

The response of an axi-symmetric structure is a combination of travelling waves and fixed

vibration and the resulting complexity makes it difficult to visualise. A suitable format is

devised for presentation of the response of a such structure to help understand what is

going on at different points of the circumference when the disc is excited.



The final part of the thesis examines the vibration interaction between a rotating disc and

an adjacent stator. There are two cases of interest which are likely to occur in pracrice.

First, when the excitation initiated on the rotating disc due to an engine order excitation.

Second, there is a possibility of vibration interaction of the stator with a disc when the

stator is excited by a cyclic force input from an external source. In both of these vibration

interactions, the critical speeds and conditions should be identified and examined in order

to take them into consideration in practice.



In conclusion, this thesis provides a clear analytical and visual picture of the vibrational

response of a rotating disc and a technique for displaying the response. The dualcontrolled

sine excitation method and its extension for more than two exciters is studied

which may be used to simulate vibration response of a disc rotating past a static force

(which is a travelling wave). A general formula for the simulation, a relationship between

the excitation forces, spatial and temporal phase angles is presented. In the study of

vibration interaction, it is shown that there is possibility of the transmission of disc

vibration to the stator or vice versa. In the former case, the stator response is a travelling

wave with frequency twice of the vibration frequency in the disc and in the latter case the

vibration of the disc is a combination of `fixed vibration' and `travelling waves'.},

 abstract = {In the analysis of structures or materials which consist of two or more components, special attention must be paid to their interaction. Whereas the assumption of complete compatibility between adjacent elements usually is sufficient in a global analysis, a more detailed calculation requires the realistic modeling of the contact interface. For this purpose an isoparametric contact element has been developed which is compatible to the two- and three-dimensional elements available in ADINA. The element can be used with a linear, quadratic, or cubic interpolation function. According to the isoparametric concept, curved element boundaries can be modeled respectively. At first, the element has been developed for the investigation of bond between concrete and reinforcement. Various bond stress-slip relations have been programmed including effects which significantly influence the bond behaviour, for example transversal pressure, although the application of the element is not restricted on bond problems. Due to the modular structure of ADINA, which has been maintained in the programming of the contact element, additional stress-slip relations can be incorporated on the level of the contact model. The application of the element with different contact models is shown in three different examples. The end anchorage of a reinforcement bar in a concrete block, the shear transfer across discrete cracks, and the joints of prefabricated wall structures are three examples which show the scale of application of the element.},

component-mode syn/hesis. A similar method, developed by Gladwell

(G2), is generally referred to as branch-mode analysis, and in an extended

form, due to Benfield and Hruda (B4), it is known as componentmode

substitutior,r. In all three approaches the structure is regarded as a

collection of substructures and, in the spirit of Rayleigh-Ritz, the motion

of each substructure is represented by a linear combination of 'component

modes'. The methods differ to some extent in the definition of the

modes, but in general one assumes that they are generated by solving

some form of substructure eigenvalue problem. But, as pointed out by

Meirovitch (M7) and Meirovitch and Hale (M8, H1, Ml0, Ml l), one

need use, in the spirit of Rayleigh-Ritz, only admissible functions. Although

substructure modes are certainly suitable admissible functions,

they are only a relatively small subset of the much broader set of

admissible functions. To emphasize the mathematical requirement, and

play down the physical implication of the term component modes, we

shall refer to the method of regarding the structure as an assemblage of

substructures each represented by a finite set of suitable admissible

functions as subs/ru cture .synfhesis.},

Such situations occur quite frequently in practice, as, for example; in the case of shrouded fan blades or in certain types of turbine-blade friction dampers. Depending on the magnitudes of the constant and the variable normal loads, the friction element will either stick, slip, or lift off at various intervals during a cycle of oscillation. The various possibilities are considered in the present study. Results from the approximate method are compared with ``long-time'' solutions obtained from a conventional transient analysis of the problem in order to assess the accuracy of the proposed procedure. As an application, the new method is then used to study the influence of the dynamic coupling on the optimization of the friction force in turbine blade dampers. Results show that the optimum friction force and the maximum amplitude of the response increase with dynamic coupling.},

The corresponding governing equations for the dynamic response are derived for both tuned and mistuned stages. As an example the method is applied to an idealized tuned stage. Two cases are considered, a lubricated shroud for which the coefficient of friction is equal to zero, and a frictionally constrained shroud. The effect of varying the shroud-to-shroud preload is studied. In the lubricated case nonlinear behavior is seen when vibrations are strong enough to result in separation of the shroud interfaces. In the case of finite friction there is a profound change in resonant frequencies when the preload is increased sufficiently to prevent gross slip at the shrouds.},

 abstract = {A model is proposed to investigate the contact kinematics of a frictional constraint experiencing two-dimensional relative motion. In this model, a contact plane is defined and its orientation is invariant. In addition, the contact normal load is assumed constant. In this study, analytical criteria are developed to determine the transitions between stick and slip which characterize how the friction force relates to the two-dimensional relative motion. Using the stick--slip transition criteria, a stick--slip diagram of elliptical motion is developed. This stick--slip diagram illustrates the fundamental characteristics of the two-dimensional contact kinematics when the relative motion has an elliptical trajectory. Fourier series expansion is employed to divide the induced periodic friction force into two components: non-linear spring resistance and friction damping. In this study, a set of non-linear functions that relate the non-linear spring resistance and friction damping to the elliptical motion are developed. It is shown that these non-linear functions can be analytically derived for the two extreme cases: circular motion and one-dimensional motion. The single-term harmonic balance scheme along with the non-linear spring resistance and friction damping of the frictional constraint are then used to calculate the resonant response of a frictionally constrained two-degree-of-freedom oscillator. The accuracy of the method is demonstrated by comparing the results with those of the direct time integration method.},

 abstract = {Damage in rotor blades, including cracks, tend to shift the blades' resonant frequencies. Blade resonances have thus been envisioned as a damage indicator. This paper studies issues that arise in blade resonance identification using Non-contacting Stress Monitoring Systems (NSMS) when blade resonances have slight variation (mistuning) and are dynamically coupled. The study compares simulation results to experimental data obtained during seeded fault tests. The main findings are as follows: The forced resonant response of a blade is seldom dominated by the blade's uncoupled dynamics. Changes due to damage in one blade are thus often reflected in the responses of many blades. To reliably identify damage by looking at one individual response at a time, the shift in resonant frequency resulting from damage must be larger than the frequency redistribution due to blade-to-blade coupling (e.g. 1{\%}-2{\%}). Only for uncoupled blades can smaller shifts in resonance frequency be reliably detected. For freer damage iden tification (e.g. less than 1{\%}), a global identification method utilizing all blade responses at once must be use to determine blade dynamics and coupling. This can be attempted with an NSMS system, which senses every blade response.},

Due to the structural vibrations, momentum is transferred to the granular material which interacts with each other. As a result, energy is dissipated by impacts and frictional phenomena between the particles. In this paper, a discrete element model is combined with a reduced finite element model. It can be analyzed for a wide frequency range. The accuracy is validated by experiments. The testbed consists of a beam with a free-free boundary condition excited by a shaker and its velocity profile is measured with a laser scanning vibrometer. The particle damper is filled with different steel balls. The discrete element code uses continuous contact models. An efficient contact algorithm is used while a coupling with a finite element model of the structure enables the prediction of the overall system movement. The system is analyzed over a wide frequency range for multiple eigenmodes. The first comparisons of experiments and simulations are performed showing a good agreement of the frequency response and modal parameters. A high dependency of the damping on the position of the particle box and its filling ratio is obtained. {\copyright} 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Additional insight on the dynamics of these systems is obtained by direct integrations of the equations of motion and by numerical Poincar{\'e} maps.

We also formulate inverse vibro-impact problems, whereby we seek the class of dynamical systems that produce specified orbits in the configuration plane. The solutions of the inverse problems are generally non-unique, since they can be reduced to underdetermined sets of algebraic equations with multiple infinities of unknowns.

Three different prototype beam-mass systems were built and tested and all successfully displayed passive self-tuning behavior when driven by vibrations at frequencies ranging from 45 to 140 Hz and accelerations ranging from 0.007 to 2g. All three systems were able to achieve tuning within their operating regime when driven at a single frequency, as well as maintain a tuned condition as frequency was stepped up or down, demonstrating a bandwidth between 6 and 40 Hz. One application of such a passively self-tuning system is in vibration energy harvesting, where it is critical for performance that the harvester device resonance frequency matches the input vibration frequency, yet the input frequency may change over time and is not known a priori. The self-tuning resonator demonstrated in this paper can enable the energy harvesting system to adjust to the varying input frequencies and thereby increase the energy harvested over time. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Specifically, numerical analysis of a model of the microscope dynamics shows branch point and isola bifurcations associated with the emergence of two families of saddle--node bifurcation points along a branch of low-amplitude oscillations. The paper argues for the origin of the degenerate bifurcations in the existence of a periodic steady-state trajectory that (i) achieves tangential contact with a discontinuity surface in a piecewise smooth model of the cantilever response and (ii) retracts from the surface under variations in either direction along a line segment in parameter space. Specifically, the discontinuity-mapping technique is here rigorously applied to a general situation of such degenerate contact showing the codimension-two nature of these bifurcations for appropriately chosen parameter values. The discontinuity-mapping-based normal form derived here is a novel extension of that derived in Dankowicz and Nordmark (2000)~[28] in the case that (ii) does not hold. In addition, the paper includes a quantitative reflection on the relative importance of discontinuities in the attractive and repulsive force components in producing the predicted bifurcations.},

 abstract = {Reduced order models (ROMs) of turbine bladed disks (blisks) are essential to quickly yet accurately characterize vibration characteristics and effectively design for high cycle fatigue. Modeling blisks with contacting shrouds at adjacent blades is especially challenging due to friction damping and localized nonlinearities at the contact interfaces which can lead to complex stick--slip behavior. While well-known techniques such as the harmonic balance method (HBM) and Craig--Bampton component mode synthesis (CB-CMS) have generally been employed to generate ROMs in the past, they do not reduce degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) at the interfaces themselves. In this paper, we propose a novel method to obtain a set of reduction basis functions for the contact interface DoFs as well as the remaining DoFs called ``adaptive microslip projection'' (AMP). The method is based on analyzing a set of linear systems with specifically chosen boundary conditions on the contact interface. Simulated responses of full order baseline models and the novel ROMs under various conditions are studied. Results obtained from the ROMs compare very favorably with the baseline model. This study addresses the case of a shrouded blisk in microslip close to stick. The AMP procedure may be possibly applied to other systems with Coulomb friction contacts, but its accuracy and effectiveness will need to be evaluated separately.},

In reality, blades also undergo asymmetric steady and unsteady aerodynamic forces due to manufacturing variations, blending, mis-staggered, or in-service wear or damage, which cause aerodynamically asymmetric systems. This paper presents the results of sensitivity studies on forced response due to aerodynamic asymmetry perturbations. The focus is only on the asymmetries due to blade motions. Hence, no asymmetric forcing functions are considered. Aerodynamic coupling due to blade motions in the equation of motion is represented using the single family of modes approach. The unsteady aerodynamic forces are computed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods assuming aerodynamic symmetry. Then, the aerodynamic asymmetry is applied by perturbing the influence coefficient matrix in the physical coordinates such that the matrix is no longer circulant. Therefore, the resulting aerodynamic modal forces in the traveling wave coordinates become a full matrix. These aerodynamic perturbations influence both stiffness and damping while traditional frequency mistuning analysis only perturbs the stiffness. It was found that maximum blade amplitudes are significantly influenced by the perturbation of the imaginary part (damping) of unsteady aerodynamic modal forces. This is contrary to blade frequency mistuning where the stiffness perturbation dominates. {\copyright} 2009 by ASME.},

The flow and structural equations are solved simultaneously, based on the frequency-domain nonlinear harmonic method and the modal reduction technique. By combining the aerodynamic forcing and damping calculations into a single analysis, the coupled solution at a single excitation frequency is approximately half that of the decoupled method. Significant flow--structure coupling effects were discovered, leading to a study into the impact of frequency shift on the fully-coupled solution. A case study on the NASA Rotor 67 transonic aero fan rotor shows a significant reduction in vibration amplitude for the fully-coupled solution due to the resonant frequency shift, caused by the aerodynamic added mass effect. Prompting the development of a novel resonance-tracking algorithm to solve the additional degree-of-freedom in resonant frequency, the increase in computational efficiency in the fully-coupled method is lost due to the need for multiple solutions. A study into the added mass effect and the implications on the coupled solution is undertaken and an evaluation is made between the use of decoupled and fully-coupled forced response systems. It is shown that the decoupled method can accurately predict the resonant vibration level from a single calculation at the natural frequency and is insensitive to frequency shift for lightly damped cases.},

In this paper an Euler--Bernoulli model has been used for vibration analysis of micro-beams with large transverse deflection. Thermoelastic damping is considered to be the dominant damping mechanism and introduced as imaginary stiffness into the equation of motion by evaluating temperature profile as a function of lateral displacement. The obtained equation of motion is analyzed in the case of pure single mode motion by two methods; nonlinear normal mode theory and the Galerkin procedure. In contrast with the Galerkin procedure, nonlinear normal mode analysis introduces a nonconventional nonlinear damping term in modal oscillator which results in strong damping in case of large amplitude vibrations. Evaluated modal oscillators are solved using harmonic balance method and tackling damping terms introduced as an imaginary stiffness is discussed. It has been shown also that nonlinear modal analysis of micro-beam with thermoelastic damping predicts parameters such as inverse quality factor, and frequency shift, to have an extrema point at certain amplitude during transient response due to the mentioned nonlinear damping term; and the effect of system׳s characteristics on this critical amplitude has also been discussed.},

 abstract = {Frequency response function measurement is a standard method in vibration system identification. Although the frequency response of a nonlinear system can be measured some issues arise from unstable branches in the response function. These unstable beaches cannot be obtained with classic measurement methods. Thus we propose the phase controlled frequency response measurement in which the ambiguity in the unstable regimes can be omitted. The method proved to work well with self-excited vibration systems. In this article the method is extended to forced vibration systems. As the forced system is not naturally stable in occurrence of unstable branches the system has to be stabilized by a feedback controller. The design of the experimental setup and the measurement method are discussed in detail. Moreover the new approach is compared to the self-excited method. All experimental results are compared to numerical solutions, which are in excellent agreement.},

 abstract = {Abstract Experimental determination of frequency response function of nonlinear systems is difficult when there exists more than one solution branch. Depending on the system at hand, various types of jump phenomena can be observed and in the example of the well-known Duffing-oscillator, it is not possible to experimentally determine the unstable solution branch if the system is excited by a harmonic force. In the present paper we investigate the Duffing-oscillator and present a method, which allows to reformulate the equation of motion of the system with force-excitation in the form of an equivalent self-excited system. Considering the phase between force and response as the input variable, it is possible to evaluate the frequency of the systems vibration for any given phase shift. In the same way the corresponding response amplitude is determined. An experimental set-up is presented, which is used to validate the performance of the method. Measurements of the backbone curve are performed and discussed on the background of theoretical predictions. ({\copyright} 2012 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co. KGaA, Weinheim)},

 abstract = {This article presents the measurement of the first-order frequency response function (FRF) for a piezoelectric ceramic ring at high vibration amplitudes. Due to the softening-type nonlinearity of piezoelectric materials, the maximum of the FRF is bended toward lower frequencies. Therefore, at high vibration amplitudes the vibration amplitude can become unstable, and this results in the occurrence of the jump phenomena. However, as we drive the piezoelectric ring by phase feedback control of the electric current, the vibration amplitude is stabilized and the whole FRF can be obtained. In addition to the frequency shift induced by the nonlinear behavior, there is an additional frequency change induced by the heat generated in the piezoelectric material. Both effects are investigated experimentally around the first radial mode of the piezoelectric ring. Moreover, the phase-controlled forced excitation driving method is presented, and its implementation is described in detail.},

Although, an exact physical situation for the contact interaction would be a combination of partial sticking and partial sliding, a preferably assumed situation is pure sliding of rotor over the stator during its interaction. The present work ensures the condition of stick is met while the rotor stator is in contact. Synchronous and sub synchronous motion of order 2 and 3 are observed.

 abstract = {High speed video cameras provide valuable information in dynamic events. Mechanical characterisation has been improved by the interpretation of the behaviour in slow-motion visualisations. In modal analysis, videos contribute to the evaluation of mode shapes but, generally, the motion is too subtle to be interpreted. In latest years, image treatment algorithms have been developed to generate a magnified version of the motion that could be interpreted by naked eye. Nevertheless, optical techniques such as Digital Image Correlation (DIC) are able to provide quantitative information of the motion with higher sensitivity than naked eye. For vibration analysis, mode shapes characterisation is one of the most interesting DIC performances. Full-field measurements provide higher spatial density than classical instrumentations or Scanning Laser Doppler Vibrometry. However, the accurateness of DIC is reduced at high frequencies asa consequence of the low displacements and hence it is habitually employed in low frequency spectra. In the current work, the combination of DIC and motion magnification is explored in order to provide numerical information in magnified videos and perform DIC mode shapes characterisation at unprecedented high frequencies through increasing the amplitude of displacements.},

Under harmonic base excitation near the primary resonance with the higher-frequency fundamental bending mode, the system shows a strongly modulated non-periodic response. The purpose of this work is to analyze to what extent the non-periodic vibro-impact dynamics can be predicted. To this end, we use a recently developed modeling and simulation approach. The approach relies on component mode synthesis, the massless boundary concept and an appropriate time stepping scheme. Unilateral contact and dry friction are modeled as set-valued laws and imposed locally within the spatially resolved contact area. A linear model updating is carried out based on the natural frequencies and damping ratios identified in the regime without impacts. The nonlinear simulation of the steady-state response to forward and backward stepped sine excitation is compared against measurements. The results are in very good agreement, especially in the light of the uncertainty associated with the observed material loss in the contact region and the nonlinear behavior of the clamping.},

The beam is clamped at one end, and the other end is pinned for the tip displacement less than some fixed value and is free for displacements greater than this value. The stiffness of the beam has the properties of a bi-linear spring. The results may be typical of a class of mechanical oscillators with play or amplitude constraining stops. Subharmonic oscillations are found to be characteristic of these types of motions. For certain values of forcing frequency and amplitude the periodic motion becomes unstable and nonperiodic bounded vibrations result. These chaotic motions have a narrow band spectrum of frequency components near the subharmonic frequencies.

Zusammenfassung

Es wird gezeigt, dass die erzwungenen Schwingungen eines elastischen Traegers mit nichtlinearen Randbedingungen unter sinusfoermiger Erregung chaotisches Verhalten aufweisen. Der Traeger ist an einem Ende eingespannt waehrend die Auslenkung des anderen Endes durch einen Stift auf einen bestimmten Hoechstwert beschraenkt ist. Fuer Auslenkungen groesser als dieser Wert ist das andere Traegerende frei. Die Steifigkeit des Traegers hat die Eigenschaften einer bilinearen Feder. Die Ergebnisse koennen fuer eine Klasse mechanischer Schwinger mit Spiel oder Amplitudenbeschraenkungen typisch sein. Es zeigt sich, dass subharmonische Schwingungen fuer diese Art von Bewegungen charakteristisch sind. Fuer bestimmte Werte der Zwangsfrequenz und Zwangsamplitude wird die periodische Bewegung unstabil und hat nichtperiodische, begrenzte Schwingungen zur Folge. Diese chaotischen Bewegungen haben ein schmales Bandspektrum mit Frequenzkomponenten in der Naehe der subharmonischen Frequenzen. Die digitale Simulierung des Traegers durch ein Modell mit einer einzigen Schwingungsform ergab mit Hilfe des Runge-Kutta Algorithmus Ergebnisse, die den experimentellen Beobachtungen qualitativ aehnlich sind.},

 abstract = {A rotordynamic analysis of a large turbo-compressor that models both the casing and supports along with the rotor-bearing system was performed. A three-dimensional (3-D) finite element model of the casing captures the intricate details of the casing and support structure. Two approaches are presented, including development of transfer functions of the casing and foundation, as well as a fully coupled rotor-casing-foundation model. The effect of bearing support compliance is captured, as well as the influence of casing modes on the rotor response. The first approach generates frequency response functions (FRF's) from the finite element case model at the bearing support locations. A high-order polynomial in numerator-denominator transfer function format is generated from a curve-fit of the FRF. These transfer functions are then incorporated into the rotordynamics model. The second approach is a fully coupled rotor and casing model that is solved together. An unbalance response calculation is performed in both cases to predict the resulting rotor critical speeds and response of the casing modes. The effect of the compressor case and supports caused the second critical speed to drop to a value close to the operating speed and not compliant with API 617 7th edition requirements. A combination of rotor, journal bearing, casing, and support modifications resulted in a satisfactory and API compliant solution. The results of the fully coupled model validated the transfer function approach.},

 abstract = {This work describes a new method for the detection and characterization of strongly nonlinear modal interactions that occur in dynamical systems with an underlying linear structure and smooth, local nonlinearities directly from transient response data. The method relies on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) to extract energy-dependent proper orthogonal mode shapes, which are used as trial vectors in the Rayleigh quotient to estimate the system's frequency content at varying energy levels. By plotting the estimated frequencies as functions of energy, an approximate frequency-energy plot (FEP) is created, which reveals the rich and interesting nonlinear dynamical interactions directly from the measured time series. The method is first applied to the simulated response of a cantilever beam with local, smooth nonlinearity and then to the experimentally measured response of a comparable cantilever beam. In both applications, the approximate FEP reveals the presence of nonsmooth perturbations in the frequency estimates emanating from the curves that connect different nonlinear normal modes (NNMs) of the system. Using wavelet-bounded empirical mode decomposition and slow-flow analysis, the nonsmooth perturbations are shown to be the result of internal resonances between two or more interacting NNMs. Ultimately, the method provides significant insight into the nonlinear physics governing dynamical systems with local, smooth nonlinearities while remaining conceptually and computationally simple compared to traditional methods. {\copyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd.},

In dynamic problems, the direction of the sliding velocity can change quite often. The many changes of the velocity direction cause many discontinuities in the friction force, complicating the process of evaluating the response of systems involving friction. In this paper, it is shown that the discontinuous Coulomb friction force can be represented by at least four different continuous functions. Each of these functions involves one constant that controls the level of accuracy of that function's representation of the friction force. The accuracy of the various representations is verified by comparing the response of a single degree freedom system, obtained through numerical solutions utilizing these representations, with an exact analytical solution.},

 abstract = {The high performance bladed disks used in today's turbomachines must meet strict standards in terms of aeroelastic stability and resonant response level. One structural characteristic that can significantly impact on both these areas is that of bladed disk mistuning. To predict the effects of mistuning, computational efficient methods are much needed to make free-vibration and forced-response analyses of full assembly finite element (FE) models feasible in both research and industrial environments. Due to the size and complexity of typical industrial bladed disk models, one must resort to robust and systematic reduction techniques to produce reduced-order models of sufficient accuracy. The objective of this paper is to compare two prevalent reduction methods on representative test rotors, including a modern design industrial shrouded bladed disk, in terms of accuracy (for frequencies and mode shapes), reduction order, computational efficiency, sensitivity to intersector elastic coupling, and ability to capture the phenomenon of mode localization. The first reduction technique employs a modal reduction approach with a modal basis consisting of mode shapes of the tuned bladed disk which can be obtained from a classical cyclic symmetric modal analysis. The second reduction technique uses Craig and Bampton substructure modes. The results show a perfect agreement between the two reduced-order models and the nonreduced finite element model. It is found that the phenomena of mode localization is equally well predicted by the two reduction models. In terms of computational cost, reductions from one to two orders of magnitude are obtained for the industrial bladed disk, with the modal reduction method being the most computationally efficient approach.},

Comparing the forced response with the aeroelastic response shows increased participation of the higher structural modes, especially for the damaged blades, that grow in time or exhibit beating. Examination of the work performed by the aerodynamic forces suggests that the growth in blade response is due to aeroelastic phenomena and can cause a potential instability. The results illustrate the importance of aeroelastic effects when predicting the post-bird-strike fan response. {\copyright} Copyright 2015 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

 abstract = {The present numerical study aims at examining the influence of intrarow interaction effects in aerodynamic damping predictions of an axial turbine rotor. The investigated operating point corresponds to a resonance crossing associated with the fundamental engine order of the stator blade row. Accordingly, the pressure perturbations induced by the vibration of the rotor at its modal frequency are found to be coincident in frequency and thus superimpose with the pressure perturbations resulting from intrarow interaction phenomena. A methodology for extracting vibration induced pressure perturbations for the subsequent calculation of the vibration induced modal aerodynamic damping is established and applied within the scope of the present study.Applying this methodology, both the influence of the underlying mean and transient flow field as well as the influence of acoustic wave reflections at the adjacent stator blade row is investigated on the predicted aerodynamic damping. In this context, the underlying mean flow field, which is found to be slightly altered in the presence of intrarow interaction phenomena, was proven to have a significant influence on vibration induced pressure perturbations. Moreover, acoustic wave reflections at the adjacent stator blade row are found to have the capability of influencing the aerodynamic damping depending on their actual phasing when impinging onto the turbine rotor.},

 abstract = {The self-adaptive behavior of a clamped-clamped beam with an attached slider has been experimentally demonstrated by several research groups. In a wide range of excitation frequencies, the system shows its signature move: The slider st slowly moves away from the beam's center, at a certain point the vibrations jump to a high level, then the slider slowly moves back towards the center and stops at some point, while the system further increases its high vibration level. In our previous work, we explained the unexpected movement of the slider away from the beam's vibration anti-node at the center by the unilateral and frictional contact interactions permitted via a small clearance between slider and beam. However, the vibration level did not increase signiantly and the slider did not turn around. In the present work, we explain, for the st time, the complete signature move. We show that the time scales of vibration and slider movement along the beam are well separated, such that the adaptive system closely follows the periodic vibration response obtained for axially ed slider. We demonstrate that the beam's geometric stiffening nonlinearity, which we neglected in our previous work, is of utmost importance for the vibration levels encountered in the experiments. This stiffening nonlinearity leads to co-existing periodic vibration responses and to a turning point bifurcation with respect to the slider position. We associate the experimentally observed jump phenomenon to this turning point, and explain why the slider must move back towards the center and stop at some point.},

Experimental identification of parameters in the modal and discrete models is discussed. The discrete model is then used as a basis to characterize the nonlinear response of a set of several blades

The nonlinear differential equations of motion of the system are transformed into a set of nonlinear algebraic equations, which are solved numerically using an iterative method. The results, which are given in terms of amplitudes and phase angles of the response, illustrate several effects including blade mistuning, magnitude and distribution of excitation forces, and phase differences between exciting forces on adjacent blades. Two general types of conclusions may be drawn so far, concerning the

influence of dry friction between blades. One concerns the effect of dry friction in reducing response amplitudes (damping effect) and the other

concerns effects of blade (effects of blade-to-blade coupling). These conclusions will be discussed in the paper.},

Optimal conditions of friction were found analytically for the tuned case. They depend on the values of the friction forces, amplitudes and phases of excitation, represented as variations of a traveling wave of excitation. The response amplitude of the blades is minimum for optimal friction. Similar considerations were applied to find the optimal blade mass and stiffness parameters for minimal response amplitudes.

An indirect method is proposed to impose constraints. Also, a new frequency-time domain

method, the Dynamic Lagrangian mixed Frequency-Time method (DLFT), is defined to get the

steady-state forced response. The dynamic Lagrangians are a new formulation for Lagrangians in

frequency domain. Note that dynamic Lagrangians may also be used in frequency domain.

This new formulation is more convenient than augmented Lagrangians when a nonlinear solver

is used to get the frequential response in frequency domain. The use of dynamic Lagrangians allow

one to solve for the nonlinear forces between two finite element nodes of the structure without

using artifacts such as a contact stiffness similar to a penalty coefficient. Hence the finite element

model does not have to be degraded at the contact interface.

Furthermore, a new reduction of the nonlinear system is proposed to decrease the required

computation time. Also, an adaptative reduction is proposed to avoid ill-conditionning problems

when structural damping is weak.

@article{naci2003,
 abstract = {A new frequency--time domain procedure, the dynamic Lagrangian mixed frequency--time method (DLFT), is proposed to calculate the non-linear steady state response to periodic excitation of structural systems subject to dry friction damping. In this formulation, the dynamic Lagrangians are defined as the non-linear contact forces obtained from the equations of motion in the frequency domain, with the adjunction of a penalization on the difference between the interface displacements calculate by the non-linear solver in the frequency domain and those calculated in the time domain from the non-linear contact forces, thus accounting for Coulomb friction and non-penetration conditions. The dynamic Lagrangians allow one to solve for the non-linear forces between two points in contact without using artifacts such as springs. The new DLFT method is thus particularly well suited to handling finite element models of structures in frictional contact, as it does not require a special model for the contact interface. Dynamic Lagrangians are also better suited to frequency-domain friction problems than the traditional time-domain method of augmented Lagrangians. Furthermore, a reduction of the non-linear system to relative interface displacements is introduced to decrease the computation time. The DLFT method is validated for a beam in contact with a flexible dry friction element connected to ground, for frictional constraints that feature two-dimensional relative motion. Results are also obtained for a large-scale structural system with a large number of one-dimensional dry-friction dampers. The DLFT method is shown to be accurate and fast, and it does not suffer from convergence problems, at least in the examples studied.},

In essence the PI method is a stepwise calculation of the joint probability density function (PDF) of a set of state space variables describing a white noise excited nonlinear dynamic system. The basic idea behind the proposed procedure is to apply a splines interpolation method to the logarithm of the calculated PDF to obtain an accurate representation of the PDF over the whole domain and not only at the chosen grid points. This exploits the fact that the logarithm of the PDF shows a more polynomial behaviour than the PDF itself, and therefore is better adapted to a splines representation. It is demonstrated that the proposed techniques may lead to significantly improved performance in calculating the response statistics of large classes of nonlinear oscillators excited by white or coloured noise when compared to other available implementations of the PI method. An advantage of the new approaches is that they allow time-variant dynamic systems to be analysed without significant increase in computer time.

 abstract = {The nonlinear dynamic analysis of shrouded turbine blade with combination effect of impact and friction between shrouds is presented in this paper. Adding shrouds to blade is for vibration reduction. It is very complex to analyze nonlinear dynamics in the presence of nonlinearities such as nonlinear resilience of springs and piecewise linearity. The shrouded blade is modeled as mass-spring model due to its features of cyclic symmetry; couplings of axial and tangential displacement of the shrouded blade are taken into account. The dynamic equations with nonlinear resilience of springs and piecewise linearity are numerically solved. Bifurcation diagrams, phase portraits and Poincare maps are employed to analyze the dynamic behavior of the shrouded blade system. The numerical results show that nonlinear shrouded blade system exhibits a variety and complex of dynamic behaviors that include periodic, multi-periodic, chaos motion, jump phenomena, etc. The nonlinear dynamic behavior of the system varies with the increase of the rotational speed, nonlinear factors of springs and amplitude of gas excitation force. The results can be helpful in understanding physically the nonlinear phenomena of a shrouded blade of aero-engine with multiple nonlinear factors, and the bifurcation results are practically meaningful for parametric design of shrouded blade.},

A kinematic external excitation in the suspension point is applied. The excitation is considered to be horizontal and harmonically variable in time. A semi-trivial solution and its stability are analyzed. Special attention is paid to the resonance domain. In certain domains of pendulum and excitation parameters the semi-trivial solution does not exist in this domain and various post-critical three-dimensional regimes occur. Some of them are non-stationary despite the harmonic excitation. Three different types of the resonance domain are investigated. Their main properties depend significantly on dynamic parameters of the pendulum and of the external excitation amplitude. An analytical and numerical study brings forth several recommendations for designers of these devices. Their aim is to avoid any post-critical response regimes endangering the pendulum functionality. {\copyright} 2008 Civil-Comp Ltd. and Elsevier Ltd.},

Essentially, in this method the non-linear differential equations are transformed into a set of non-linear algebraic equations in terms of the Fourier coefficients of the periodic solutions which are solved by using the Newton--Raphson technique. The method is developed such that both fast Fourier transform and discrete Fourier transform algorithms can be used. It is capable of treating all types of non-linearities and higher dimensional systems. The stability of periodic orbits is investigated by obtaining the monodromy matrix. A path following algorithm based on the predictor--corrector method is also presented to enable the bifurcation analysis. The prediction is done with a cubic extrapolation technique with an arc length incrementation while the correction is done with the use of the least square minimisation technique. The under determined system of equations is solved by singular value decomposition. The suitability of the method is demonstrated by obtaining the bifurcational behaviour of rolling contact vibrations modelled by Hertz contact law.},

 abstract = {Elastic-collision problems are the foundations of all collision problems, and a bar and a beam can represent a typical and simple structure. However, the elastic collision of a bar and a beam is a complicated phenomenon. The purpose of this research is to clarify the relationship between the principal parameter and the kinetic characteristics that influence this complicated elastic collision phenomenon, and to explain these on the basis of an impact force waveform, the apparent coefficient of restitution, and energy distribution. We employed an analysis method in which the impact force assumes an exponential function for the basic equation of the one-dimensional elastic vibration corresponding to the longitudinal vibration of the bar and the lateral vibration of the beam, and in which the force satisfies the condition of continuity of the displacement. In the experiment, assuming flat-surface contact, we directly detected collision phenomenon electrically using PZT pasted onto the end surface of the collision bar. On the basis of this study, the key parameter in the above-mentioned collision phenomenon is clarified, and an energy distribution situation and the influence of each parameter can now be considered for arbitrary combinations of the bar and beam. Furthermore, it is assumed that there is a correlation among the energy state after collision between a bar and a beam, the restitution state and the sound generated when a beam and a bar collide. Therefore, it is important to analytically study the effect of key parameters on various energy states. Thus, as our principal result, the complicated motion of a system involving an intermittent collision phenomenon namely, an elastic bar and an elastic beam supported at both ends, was clarified theoretically and experimentally.},

Analyses are presented for three cases: undamped free vibrations, forced damped vibrations with a sinusoidal input, and vibrations with a broadband random input.

A comparison with experimental data shows these arguments to be reasonably accurate.

Automatic differentiation consists of exact algorithms on floating-point arguments. This implementation overloads standard elementary operators and functions in MATLAB with a derivative rule in addition to the function value; for example, {\$}$\backslash$sin u{\$} will also compute {\$}($\backslash$cos u)$\backslash$ast u{\^{}}{\prime}{\$}, where u and {\$}u{\^{}}{\prime }{\$} are numerical values. These methods are mostly one-line programs that operate on a class of value-and-derivative objects, providing a simple example of object-oriented programming in MATLAB using the new (as of release 2008a) class definition structure. The resulting powerful tool computes derivative values and multivariable gradients, and is applied to Newton's method for root-finding in both single and multivariable settings. To compute higher-order derivatives of a single-variable function, another class of series objects keeps Taylor polynomial coefficients up to some order. Overloading multiplication on series objects is a combination (discrete convolution) of coefficients. This idea leads to algorithms for other operations and functions on series objects. A survey of more advanced topics in automatic differentiation includes an introduction to the reverse mode (our implementation is forward mode) and considerations in arbitrary-order multivariable series computation.},

 abstract = {In this paper we discuss a theoretical technique for decomposing

multi-degree-of-freedom weakly nonlinear systems into a

simpler form - an approach which has parallels with the well

know method for linear modal analysis. The key outcome is that

the system resonances, both linear and nonlinear are revealed by

the transformation process. For each resonance, parameters can

be obtained which characterise the backbone curves, and higher

harmonic components of the response. The underlying mathematical

technique is based on a near identity normal form transformation.

This is an established technique for analysing weakly

nonlinear vibrating systems, but in this approach we use a variation

of the method for systems of equations written in secondorder

form. This is a much more natural approach for structural

dynamics where the governing equations of motion are written in

this form as standard practice. In fact the first step in the method

is to carry out a linear modal transformation using linear modes

as would typically done for a linear system. The near identity

transform is then applied as a second step in the process and

one which identifies the nonlinear resonances in the system being

considered. For an example system with cubic nonlinearities,

we show how the resulting transformed equations can be used to

obtain a time independent representation of the system response.

We will discuss how the analysis can be carried out with applied

forcing, and how the approximations about response frequencies,

made during the near-identity transformation, affect the accu-

racy of the technique. In fact we show that the second-order normal

form approach can actually improve the predictions of suband

super-harmonic responses. Finally we comment on how this

theoretical technique could be used as part of a modal testing

approach in future work.},

 abstract = {The dynamics of a novel piezoelectric device for drilling of brittle materials is investigated. This device consists of a resonantly driven piezoelectric actuator, a drill stem, as well as a free-flying mass oscillating and impacting between the tip of the piezoelectric actuator and the end of the drill stem. Contact interfaces exist between the actuator and the mass, the mass and the drill stem as well as between the drill stem and the machined material. Basic understanding of the device's dynamic behaviour is crucial, for example to enhance the drilling performance or to redesign the system for different corer or drill stem geometries. However, such a basic understanding is still missing. Experiments with a prototype device as well as simulations with simple models show irregular motion of the impacting mass. To investigate the complicated temporal behaviour of this system, so-called set-oriented numerical methods are applied. These methods are based on an adaptive subdivision technique for cell-mapping to approximate attractors and invariant measures. A model for the drilling device is proposed consisting of several degrees of freedom. The motion of the piezoelectric actuator tip follows a prescribed harmonic vibration; the free-flying mass is represented as a point mass. The drill stem is modelled as a rod structure to account for longitudinal wave propagation. The contact conditions between the different subsystems are described by complementary kinematics and force relations and Newton's impact law, respectively. Using the set-oriented methods, periodic and chaotic orbits are detected and parameter ranges for the occurrence of different types of solutions are determined. Additionally, basins of attraction for the corresponding attractors are computed. Information on the probability of attaining a particular attractor is obtained by quantifying its connected basin of attraction. An invariant measure is chosen which represents the drilling performance. For most important model parameters, for example the mass of the free-flying body or the actuator excitation frequency, drilling performance is evaluated by computing this invariant measure for each attractor. The computational results lead to a deeper understanding of the vibro-impact dynamics of this drilling device, reveal the global behaviour of the system dynamics and show the influence of different design parameters on the drilling performance.},

Damage can be present in the form of initial material or manufacturing defects, or can develop during service operation. Three major sources of in-service damage have been identified which can alter the HCF resistance individually or in conjunction with one another: low cycle fatigue (LCF), foreign object damage (FOD), and fretting. Methodologies for treating such damage in establishing material allowables are considered.

 abstract = {The paper deals with the non-linear dynamic analysis of cables with a pair of viscous dampers close to one support. Such cables are characterized by a sag-to-chord-length ratio below 0.02, for which natural frequencies for the vertical and the horizontal vibrations are pair-wise close. Under resonance the non-linear coupling of pairs of modes may cause whirling harmonic motions around the chord line. Whirling motion may occur after bifurcation from single-mode response for harmonic loads in either vertical or horizontal direction. The non-linear features are included in the two coupled modes, while all other modes are treated as linear. The motion is discretized by expansion in terms of the damped complex eigenfunctions. The applied base functions fulfil the transition condition at the damper, leading to fast convergence of the expansion. It is demonstrated that the behaviour of the whirling motion is controlled primarily by the damper acting in the direction of the unloaded mode, whereas the magnitude of the damper in the loaded mode is less important. If the dampers in the vertical and horizontal direction are close to the optimal value of the corresponding taut cable case, substantial reduction of the vibration level of the whirling mode as well as the frequency interval of its occurrence is attained. {\copyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

@phdthesis{niko2006a,
 abstract = {An attempt is made in this thesis to shed new light on the blade mistuning problem, which has defiantly opposed a `solution'. The fundamental problem with blade mistuning stems from the fact that small blade-to-blade variations, due to practically unavoidable manufacturing tolerances and wear, produce large uncertainty in the forced response levels of bladed discs. This is a phenomenon that often results in one or more blades experiencing excessive vibration levels, sometimes leading to catastrophic high-cycle fatigue failures. For this reason, the mistuning problem has been the focus of attention by many researchers for the past four decades. Although knowledge on mistuning has been continuously enriched since the late 1960s, the ill-effects of mistuning have still not been successfully eliminated.



This research commences by tracing the real roots of the mistuning problem by presenting a philosophical debate on mistuning. As a result, so-called ``critical outstanding mistuning questions'' are identified in an attempt to bridge the existing gap between academic and industrial concerns. The approach chosen in this study is to raise new questions to revisit old mistuning problems in a new, illuminating way. In the light of this, the work reported in this thesis is split into three parts. The first challenges the conventional belief commonly accepted in bladed disc analysis with regard to the effect of Coriolis forces in an effort to improve the fundamental model used in analysis. Experimental validation of predictions including the previously-neglected Coriolis effect using a carefully-designed testpiece serves to provide indisputable evidence of the influence of Coriolis forces. This result prompts a unique numerical study of mutual influence of Coriolis forces and blade mistuning on forced response characteristics, revealing that there are particular bladed disc designs where the Coriolis forces cannot be neglected due to their non-trivial impact on maximum amplification factors, contrary to a current belief.



With an aim of establishing whether the recent trends to relax manufacturing tolerances could be used effectively to reduce and control the maximum forced response levels, two strategies based on new ``large mistuning'' concept are introduced in the second part of the thesis. The first of them, involving a statistical study with extensive Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrates the benefits of such a scheme on an industrial bladed disc. Subsequently, a few favourable deterministic patterns of unconventionally large mistuning strengths are explored and their sensitivity and robustness assessed. It is shown that the latter is of utmost importance in gauging the usefulness of design.



The final part of the thesis attempts to make generalisations about bladed disc vibration problems by discussing lessons learned from the specific cases studied and by anticipating future developments, trends and philosophy. Results obtained provide solid ground for deeper understanding of the blade mistuning problem and for effective ways of preventing (rather than curing) it, which are believed to be beneficial for industry.},

 abstract = {For the first time, the significance of including the effects of Coriolis forces in bladed disc vibration analysis has been validated experimentally using a carefully designed testpiece, the principal feature of which incorporates a prominent radial flexibility, enforcing the action of the Coriolis forces. This design exhibited a phenomenon, predicted by theory, of natural frequency splits for all nodal diameter modes of a tuned bladed disc into pairs of distinct-frequency modes, with backward and forward travelling wave mode shapes, due entirely to the influence of Coriolis forces. The action of these forces was found to be sensitive to the amount of radial-tangential blade vibration coupling. Furthermore, for this particular highly flexible testpiece, a speed-dependent convex shape of the natural frequency split plot has been established, which is a result of a mutual interaction between the Coriolis and centrifugal effects. The experimental results convincingly validate the predictions made using a code which has the possibility to analyse this complex behaviour.},

The problem of vibration localization in a rotor constituted by N coupled airfoils with plunge and pitch degrees of freedom subjected to flutter instability is considered. For a single airfoil, it is shown that depending on the system parameters, multiple static and dynamic equilibria coexist which may be a fixed point, a limit cycle, or irregular motion. By elastically coupling N airfoils, a simplified rotor model is obtained. The nonlinear dynamical response of the rotor is studied via time integration with particular attention to the emergence of localized vibrating solutions, which have been classified introducing a localization coefficient. Finally, the concept of basin stability is exploited to ascertain the likelihood of the system to converge to a certain localized state as a function of the airstream velocity. We found that homogeneous and slightly localized states are more likely to appear with respect to strongly localized states.},

The objective of the present paper is to address the identification of a strongly nonlinear satellite structure. To this end, two nonlinear subspace identification methods formulated in the time and frequency domains are exploited, referred to as the TNSI and FNSI methods, respectively. The modal parameters of the underlying linear structure and the coefficients of the nonlinearities will be estimated by these two approaches based on periodic random measurements. Their respective merits will also be discussed in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency and the use of stabilisation diagrams in nonlinear system identification will be introduced. The application of interest is the SmallSat spacecraft developed by EADS-Astrium, which possesses an impact-type nonlinear device consisting of eight mechanical stops limiting the motion of an inertia wheel mounted on an elastomeric interface. This application is challenging for several reasons including the non-smooth nature of the nonlinearities, high modal density and high non-proportional damping.},

Since the bladed disk is a one-piece structure, there are no welded connections between the blades and the disk and the material properties can be assumed to be uniform. It can be shown that these differences come from non uniform clamping conditions, and that this mistuning is of the same order of magnitude than the variations in the geometry of the structure.

We consider the linear elastodynamic of a dissipative structure composed of two main dissipative substructures perfectly connected through interfaces by a linking substructure. The linking substructure is flexible and is modeled in the context of the general linear viscoelasticity theory, yielding damping and stiffness operators depending on the frequency, while the two main dissipative substructures are modeled in the context of linear elasticity with an additional classical viscous damping modeling which is assumed to be independent of the frequency. We present recent advances adapted to such a situation, which is positioned with respect to an appropriate review that we carry out on the different methods used in dynamic substructuring. It consists in constructing a reduced-order model using the free-interface elastic modes of the two main substructures and, for the linking substructure, an appropriate frequency-independent elastostatic lifting operator and the frequency-dependent fixed-interface vector basis. {\copyright} 2014 CIMNE, Barcelona, Spain.},

This work was aimed at studying the hysteritic behaviour of the ferroelasticity and superelasticity observed in a polycrystalline NiTi alloy by carrying out simple shear deformation tests through both major and subloop cycles.

In this paper, it is proposed to add a viscoelastic layer on the ABH and control its mechanical properties by varying the temperature of the material in order to obtain an ABH with tunable properties. A design methodology of the damping layer is proposed, based on the computation of the reflection coefficient of the ABH termination, hence independent from the excitation and the boundary conditions of the host structure. This optimization is performed at a temperature close to the glass transition of the viscoelastic material in order to find the configuration providing the highest dissipation. Then, by controlling the temperature of the patch it is easy to tune the behavior of the ABH according to the practical application which is considered.},

@article{Pacheco.2018,
 abstract = {High-speed flight can cause aircraft skin to exhibit an aeroelastic instability typically called panel flutter. Due to the risk of fatigue failure imposed by this undesired phenomenon, several techniques have been proposed over the years to passively or actively control such aeroelastic vibrations. One relatively new method that has been proven effective for controlling various aeroelastic phenomena is the use of nonlinear energy sinks (NES). Here, for the first time, this technique is employed for suppressing panel flutter and reducing the intensity of limit cycle oscillations (LCOs). The present work consists of a comprehensive study on the numerical modeling of a NES, its coupling to an aeroelastic finite element plate model, and several solutions attained through the resulting system. In order to simulate LCOs, a geometrically nonlinear plate model is employed. The supersonic aerodynamic loads are modeled by piston theory, and the final aeroelastic equations of motion are solved directly in time by an implicit integrator. The energy dissipated by the NES and the energy injected in the panel by the flow are obtained numerically as a function of time. This provides important insights on the mechanism through which a NES can either suppress flutter or mitigate LCOs by partially balancing the aerodynamic work. The performance of the NES is tested in three regimes: At the pre-flutter regime, the NES leads the panel to a faster return to equilibrium after a perturbation; at higher speeds, the NES is still able to suppress flutter, whereas an uncontrolled panel would exhibit LCOs; at even higher speeds, the NES is no longer able to completely suppress the motion but can pump enough energy to reduce the amplitude of the LCOs. In any of these scenarios, the practical outcome would be a longer lifespan for the skin structure. Furthermore, a parametric study is conducted to assess how different NES parameters such as damping coefficient and nonlinear stiffness affect the aeroelastic response. The results reveal that a NES can be used as a lightweight device for passively controlling panel flutter, and that such technique is suitable for optimization-driven design.},

@article{Pacini.2022,
 abstract = {Nonlinear force appropriation is an extension of its linear counterpart where sinusoidal excitation is applied to a structure with a modal shaker and phase quadrature is achieved between the excitation and response. While a standard practice in modal testing, modal shaker excitation has the potential to alter the dynamics of the structure under test. Previous studies have been conducted to address several concerns, but this work specifically focuses on a shaker-structure interaction phenomenon which arises during the force appropriation testing of a nonlinear structure. Under pure-tone sinusoidal forcing, a nonlinear structure may respond not only at the fundamental harmonic but also potentially at sub- or superharmonics, or it can even produce aperiodic and chaotic motion in certain cases. Shaker-structure interaction occurs when the response physically pushes back against the shaker attachment, producing non-fundamental harmonic content in the force measured by the load cell, even for pure tone voltage input to the shaker. This work develops a model to replicate these physics and investigates their influence on the response of a nonlinear normal mode of the structure. Experimental evidence is first provided that demonstrates the generation of harmonic content in the measured load cell force during a force appropriation test. This interaction is replicated by developing an electromechanical model of a modal shaker attached to a nonlinear, three-mass dynamical system. Several simulated experiments are conducted both with and without the shaker model in order to identify which effects are specifically due to the presence of the shaker. The results of these simulations are then compared to the undamped nonlinear normal modes of the structure under test to evaluate the influence of shaker-structure interaction on the identified system's dynamics.},

Instead, this paper proposes to utilize the technique of parametriccontinuationto study the steady state response and global dynamics of a two-degree-of-freedom piecewise non-linear system with backlash or multi-valued springs and impact damping. The physical system is under the influence of a mean load and is subject to a dual harmonic external excitation, where the second frequency is either twice or three times the fundamental excitation frequency. The effects of various parameters such as impact damping, mean and alternating loads, the piecewise stiffness ratios and the relative phase between the excitation harmonics on the system response are thoroughly examined. System or excitation parameter regimes that exhibit sub-harmonic, super-harmonic quasi-periodic and chaotic solutions are obtained efficiently and systematically by using the proposed scheme. This investigation also clarifies the differences between viscous and non-linear impact damping models, which have been proposed earlier in the literature for studying clearance non-linearities. Limited experimental data validate our modelling strategy. Finally, selected predictions from this technique match very well with a multi-term harmonic balance method and with direct numerical integration, wherever applicable.},

 abstract = {The dynamic behavior and frequency response of harmonically excited piecewise linear and/or non-linear systems has been the subject of several recent investigations. Most of the prior studies employed harmonic balance or Galerkin schemes, piecewise linear techniques, analog simulation and/or direct numerical integration (digital simulation). Such techniques are somewhat limited in their ability to predict all of the dynamic characteristics, including bifurcations leading to the occurrence of unstable, subharmonic, quasi-periodic and/or chaotic solutions. To overcome this problem, a parametric continuation scheme, based on the shooting method, is applied specifically to a periodically excited piecewise linear/non-linear system, in order to improve understanding as well as to obtain the complete dynamic response. Parameter regions exhibiting bifurcations to harmonic, subharmonic or quasi-periodic solutions are obtained quite efficiently and systematically. Unlike other techniques, the proposed scheme can follow period-doubling bifurcations, and with some modifications obtain stable quasi-periodic solutions and their bifurcations. This knowledge is essential in establishing conditions for the occurrence of chaotic oscillations in any non-linear system. The method is first validated through the Duffing oscillator example, the solutions to which are also obtained by conventional one-term harmonic balance and perturbation methods. The second example deals with a clearance non-linearity problem for both harmonic and periodic excitations. Predictions from the proposed scheme match well with available analog simulation data as well as with multi-term harmonic balance results. Potential savings in computational time over direct numerical integration is demonstrated for some of the example cases. Also, this work has filled in some of the solution regimes for an impact pair, which were missed previously in the literature. Finally, one main limitation associated with the proposed procedure is discussed.},

The results presented describe the transient dynamics of rotor and casing vibro-impact response at engine operational speed similar to those experienced in flight. Force components at the blade tip in axial and circumferential directions for a rub of moderate incursion depth (140 \textgreek{m}m) are compared to those for a severe rub (406 \textgreek{m}m). Similar general trends of variation during the metal-to-metal contact are observed. However, in the nearly three-fold higher incursion the maximum incurred circumferential load increases significantly, while the maximum incurred axial load increases much less, demonstrating the non-linear nature of the rub phenomena. Concurrently, the stress magnification on the rubbing blade at root mid-chord, at tip leading edge, and at tip trailing edge is discussed. The results point to the possibility of failure occurring first at the airfoil trailing edge. Such a failure was in fact observed in the most severe rub obtained to date in the laboratory, consistent with field observations. Computational models to analyze the non-linear dynamic response of a rotating beam with periodic pulse loading at the free-end are currently under development and are noted.},

a spatial model is presented including an appropriate spatial

contact model to predict the generalized contact forces acting between

blade vibration amplitudes. The friction forces generated

dissipation.

In practice, a number of different underplatform damper designs

contact areas, cylindrical dampers with curved surfaces or asymmetrical

dampers with both flat contact surfaces on one side and

curved contact surfaces on the other. The latter damper type

combines the advantages of both the wedge and the cylindrical

damper by preventing the damper from pure rolling on the one

hand as it has been observed for cylindrical dampers and on the

other hand, avoiding a diverged plane area contact in case of a

wedge damper, causing a damper lift-off.

The rotating blades of turbomachinery applications such as turbines and compressors are

subjected to high thermal and mechanical loads. Beside the centrifugal forces, additional

dynamic forces are acting on the blades due to a non-homogeneous pressure field of the

fluid. The reduction of the resulting blade vibrations is one of the main tasks during the

structural blade design process. To decrease vibration amplitudes, additional damping is

introduced by frictional contacts between the blade platforms and so-called underplatform

dampers.



Within this work, a model is developed to calculate the forced response of both tuned and

mistuned bladed disks under consideration of almost arbitrary underplatform damper

geometries that are applied to turbomachinery bladings in practice. Therefore, the bladed

disk as well as the underplatform damper dynamics is described in the modal domain. In

the case of the tuned system, cyclic boundary conditions are applied. The mistuned disk is

also transformed into the modal domain by the mode shapes of the tuned system. To calculate

the contact forces acting between the blades and the dampers, a three-dimensional

contact model is applied that is based on a discretization of the contact area into several

point contacts to consider distributed contact forces. Each point contact comprises the calculation

of normal as well as two tangential contact forces. To avoid a time-consuming calculation

of the nonlinear contact forces, the Harmonic Balance Method is applied, limited

to the consideration of the fundamental harmonic. This allows a very efficient calculation

of the system dynamics in the frequency domain by using amplitude dependent complex

contact stiffnesses. As a consequence, detailed parameter variations can be carried out.



The systematic study of parameter variations shows a significant influence of the damper

geometry on the overall vibrational behaviour with respect to the achievable amplitude

reduction and the shift of the resonance frequency. With regard to the avoidance of resonances

with multiples of the rotational speed, it becomes evident that asymmetrical and

wedge shaped underplatform dampers with plane contacts cause a bigger frequency shift

if compared with cylindrical dampers with line contacts. Furthermore, a partial separation

of the contact areas can occur due to a rotation of the contact areas with respect to the blade

platforms, resulting in a decreasing damping effect. These simulation results have been

confirmed qualitatively and quantitatively by experimental tests at simple non-rotating

model blades as well as real gas turbine bladings.},

time-consuming task. The existing friction interfaces, e.g. in flange or bolt connections, can

be utilized to provide a significant amount of damping due to energy dissipation caused by

microslip or macroscopic relative displacements between the contacting bodies. By designing

these interconnections accurately or, alternatively, creating additional friction contacts,

the damping can be increased remarkably, affecting the vibration amplitudes, reliability and

lifetime of a structure. Starting with the theoretical background of existing contact models

and solution techniques for non-linear differential equations with friction forces, a systematic

procedure for designing friction interfaces in order to maximize the damping is presented.

The influence on the structural stiffness and the expected damping ratio will be discussed.

The developed theoretical models are accompanied by experimental tests at different sample

structures with friction contacts to show the great potential of friction damping. Beam

structures, space structures, turbine blades and combustion engines will serve as examples

of the variety of different technical applications where friction damping can be used

successfully to reduce vibration amplitudes.},

A linearized Euler analysis, previously validated using experimental data, is used for a series of parameter studies. The influence of mode shape and reduced frequency are investigated. Mode shape is identified as the most important contributor to determining the stability of a blade design. A new stability parameter is introduced to gain additional insight into the key contributors to flutter. This stability parameter is derived from the influence coefficient representation of the cascade, and includes only contributions from the reference blade and its immediate neighbors. This has the effect of retaining the most important contributions to aerodynamic damping while filtering out terms of less significance. This parameter is utilized to develop a stability map, which provides the critical reduced frequency as a function of torsion axis location.

Non-linear vibration analysis is traditionally carried out

under the assumption that the mechanical properties and forcing

function are deterministic. Since every mechanical system is

by nature uncertain a truly accurate nonlinear dynamic analysis

requires the inclusion of random variables in the response predictions.

The propagation of random input uncertainties in a NNM

Numerical Method (ANM) will be used to calculate the NNMs

for a contact problem in a computationally efficient way. The

stochastic NNM permits to quantify the effect of uncertainties

on the resonance frequency and the change in mode shape due

to non-linearities, leading to the calculation of uncertain internal

resonances. The proposed method is initially applied to a simple

spring-mass system to demonstrate the effects of uncertainty

on the NNM predictions. In a second step a blade-casing interaction

with localized contact non-linearity is investigated with a

real geometry. The resulting NNMs show the presence of internal

resonance for both cases.},

The paper addresses the influence of the crack breathing models on the nonlinear vibration characteristics of the cracked rotors.

Equations of motion for the cracked rotor are systematically presented for both the models. Through numerical simulations, the dynamic response for both the crack models is compared for the subcritical speed region for the rotor. Distinct differences have been found in bifurcation, amplitude, orbit and Poincar{\'e} map when carrying out the comparison between two models for the assumed rotor parameters. Switching crack modelling reveals chaotic, quasi-periodic and subharmonic vibration response for deeper cracks. Rotor system enters into chaos or quasi-periodic motion directly from periodic motion, and leaves the chaos via route of quasi-period. Transient chaos behaviour is also observed for the first time in the case of cracked rotor. Contrary to this, more realistic breathing crack model reveals no evidence of chaotic, quasi-periodic and subsynchronous vibrations in the response. Unbalance eccentricity level and its phase, crack depth and damping are found to have considerable influence on the bifurcation phenomena of the cracked rotor modelled using switching crack model.},

 abstract = {Abstract

In this work the fluid--structure interactions are considered by investigating a straight but slender pipe interacting with uniform water flow. Two configurations are studied, namely vertically and horizontally positioned pipes, which are modelled as an Euler--Bernoulli beam with flexural stiffness. Both pretension and length-wise mass distribution are considered. The structure is assumed to be moving only in the direction normal to flow (cross-flow motion) hence its in-line motion is neglected. The external fluid force acting on the structure is the result of the action of sectional vortex-induced drag and lift forces. Only mean drag force is considered, with time varying lift force modelled using a non-linear oscillator equation of the Van der Pol type. The obtained coupled system of non-linear partial differential equations is simplified employing Galerkin-type discretisation. The resulting ordinary differential equations are solved numerically providing multi-mode approximations of cross-flow displacement and non-dimensional lift coefficient. The comparison between the responses of vertical and horizontal structures shows that, as expected due to a balancing between pretension and weight, in general a higher amplitude of vibration is observed for the vertical configuration than in the same location along the pipe for the horizontal configuration in the lower part of the structure. However, lower amplitudes are obtained in the upper part of the pipe. The horizontal configuration solutions are identical in symmetrical locations along the pipe due to constant pretension. The influence of the wake equation coefficients and the fluid force coefficients on the response amplitudes has been also considered together with the length of the pipe and pretension level, and the appropriate response curves are included. Finally, for the higher mode approximations it has been shown that the vibrations level at lower frequencies is predicted reasonably well by retaining only a small subset of modes.},

 abstract = {The Acoustic Black Hole (ABH) is a technique for passive vibration control that was recently developed within the Structural Dynamics and Vibroacoustics communities. From a general perspective, the ABH effect is achieved by embedding a local inhomogeneity in a thin-walled structure, typically a beam or a plate. This inhomogeneity is characterized by a variation of the geometric properties (although material variations are also possible) according to a spatial power law profile. The combination of a local stiffness reduction, due to the power law variation of the wall thickness, and of a local increase in damping, provided by the concurrent application of viscoelastic layers, gives rise to a significant reduction of the wave speed and to a remarkable enhancement of the attenuation properties. As an elastic wave travels within an ABH, its speed experiences a smooth and continuous decrease. In the ideal case, that is when the wall thickness vanishes at the ABH center, the wave speed decreases to zero. In the non-ideal case, that is when the ABH has a non-zero residual thickness at its center, the wave speed still decreases smoothly but it never vanishes. In this latter case, which is of great importance for practical applications, the ABH is typically combined with lossy media (e.g. viscoelastic layers) in order to achieve significantly enhanced structural loss factors. If the speed of an incoming wave can vanish inside the ABH, it follows that this object behaves as a wave trap that extracts elastic energy from the host medium without, in principle, ever releasing it. Several characteristic properties are generally observed in structures with embedded ABHs: significant reduction in vibration and acoustic radiation levels, low reflection coefficient at the ABH location, localized vibration and trapped modes, and existence of cut-on frequencies. Contrarily to passive vibration methods based on viscoelastic materials, the ABH was developed and applied to reduce vibrations and structure-radiated noise without increasing the total mass of the system. More recently, applications to other areas including elastic metastructures, energy harvesting, vibro-impact systems, and cochlear systems were also investigated. This review is intended to provide a comprehensive summary of the state-of-the-art of ABH technology, spanning from theoretical and numerical contributions to practical applications.},

ABSTRACT

The

re  has  been  some  concern  that  the  blades  in  the 

re

al   engine   op

erating   environment   may   not   always 

behave  in  a  linea

r  manner.  The  non

-

linearity  can  arise 

from  friction  contact  surfaces  (i.e.  blade  dovetails  and 

discs),    non

-

linear  material  properties  (i.e.  Young's 

modulus,     non

-

linear

temperature     dependence     o

f 

modulus),    component    manufacturing    variability,    and 

component  design  geometry. 

The

vibration  forcing  itself 

can  also 

cause  multi

-

modal

responses 

when  applied  as 

multi

.

T

he    present    study    aims    at 

investigating  the  effects  of 

static  contact 

f

riction 

loads

on 

the  blade 

vibration  responses

. 

Moreover, 

some  natural 

frequencies    of    the 

blade    investigated

here    are 

commensurable and thus leading to internal resonance in 

the  system  and  nonlinear  interactions  between  involved 

modes.

This  investiga

tion  shows  that  some  blade  vibration 

modes  are  more  sensitive to the blade root friction 

loads

than others. This sensitivity

is associated with modeshape 

localisations. 

The  other  source  of  non

-

linear  behavior  is 

related   to 

internal   resonances

. 

This   particu

geometry 

affect

s

the  blade  stiffness  in  such  a  way  that 

some 

natural   frequencies   are 

commensurable.

For 

instance, there is an internal resonance between the first 

and   second   torsion   modes.  The   modal   frequency   of 

second torsion is twice the first 

torsion frequency. 

Both the 

non

-

linearity  effects  associated  with  contact  friction 

loads 

and 

internal   resonances   seem   to   result   from   the 

interactions 

of 

two or more natural vibration modes. There 

is  a  dominant  mod

al  response 

among  the 

interacting 

modes

.    F

ast  Fourier  Transforms  (FFT)  of  response

@article{penn2011,
 abstract = {Blade vibration reduction is an important task in high performance turbo machinery for power generation, in order to avoid the risk of blade failure due to the overcoming of fatigue limit. A possible way to obtain this result is a contact related phenomenon, i.e. by physically limiting the vibration amplitude on the blade tip leaving a small gap between the shrouds of adjacent blades. When the relative displacement between adjacent blades exceeds the gap, in a certain vibration mode of the blade row, a contact occurs between the shrouds, the relative motion is restricted and energy is dissipated by friction and impact during the contact. This is called the snubbing mechanism.

In this paper, an original simplified model of bladed disks, in which the snubbing mechanism can occur, is presented and numerical integration in time domain furnishes the time histories of the vibrations of the blades. The level of vibration reduction is then evaluated in some different modes that could be excited for instance by the fluid flow. It is also shown that unlucky combinations of system and excitation parameters can effect also a certain magnification instead of a reduction of the vibration amplitudes.

Experimental results on single blade and blade groups of a steam turbine are used to tune the parameters of the system.},

 abstract = {In this paper, the dynamics of a system composed of a harmonically forced single-degree-of-freedom linear oscillator coupled to a vibro-impact nonlinear energy sink (VI-NES) is experimentally investigated. The mass ratio between the VI-NES and the primary system is about {\$}{\$}1\%${\$}. Depending on the external force's amplitude and frequency, either a strongly modulated response (SMR) or a constant amplitude response (CAR) is observed. In both cases, an irreversible transfer of energy occurs from the linear oscillator toward the VI-NES: process known in the literature as passive targeted energy transfer. Furthermore, the problem is analytically studied by using the method of multiple scales. The obtained slow invariant manifold shows the existence of a stable and of an unstable branch of solutions, as well as of an energy threshold (a saddle-node bifurcation) for the solutions to appear. Subsequently, the fixed points of the problem are calculated. When a stable fixed point is reached, the system is naturally drawn to it and a CAR is established, whereas when no stable point is attained, the system exhibits a SMR regime. Finally, a good correlation between the experimental and the analytical results is presented.},

According to this approach, the generalized theory of non-linear normal vibration modes by Shaw and Pierre, the modified Rauscher method and the harmonic balance method are combined with a new iterative computation procedure.



The proposed approach is used in analysis of the single-disk rotor system with the isotropic-elastic shaft and the non-linear supports of Duffing type. Gyroscopic effects, asymmetrical disposition of the disk on the shaft and internal resonance are also taken into account. The NNM approach allows reducing the 8-DOF problem of the rotor dynamics to the 2-DOF non-linear system for each non-linear normal mode. Both the model of massless supports and the model of supports with inertial effects are considered. It is shown that in last case all resonance regimes are separated into two different kinds. First kind corresponds to cyclic symmetric trajectories in a system's configuration space; the second kind corresponds to centrally symmetric ones. Regimes of the first kind can be evaluated by the use of the simplified mathematical model proposed in this work. Simplified model consists only of four generalized coordinates instead of the eight initial ones.},

@article{Pesaresi.2017,
 abstract = {Underplatform dampers (UPD) are commonly used in aircraft engines to mitigate the risk of high-cycle fatigue failure of turbine blades. The energy dissipated at the friction contact interface of the damper reduces the vibration amplitude significantly, and the couplings of the blades can also lead to significant shifts of the resonance frequencies of the bladed disk. The highly nonlinear behaviour of bladed discs constrained by UPDs requires an advanced modelling approach to ensure that the correct damper geometry is selected during the design of the turbine, and that no unexpected resonance frequencies and amplitudes will occur in operation. Approaches based on an explicit model of the damper in combination with multi-harmonic balance solvers have emerged as a promising way to predict the nonlinear behaviour of UPDs correctly, however rigorous experimental validations are required before approaches of this type can be used with confidence. In this study, a nonlinear analysis based on an updated explicit damper model having different levels of detail is performed, and the results are evaluated against a newly-developed UPD test rig. Detailed linear finite element models are used as input for the nonlinear analysis, allowing the inclusion of damper flexibility and inertia effects. The nonlinear friction interface between the blades and the damper is described with a dense grid of 3D friction contact elements which allow accurate capturing of the underlying nonlinear mechanism that drives the global nonlinear behaviour. The introduced explicit damper model showed a great dependence on the correct contact pressure distribution. The use of an accurate, measurement based, distribution, better matched the nonlinear dynamic behaviour of the test rig. Good agreement with the measured frequency response data could only be reached when the zero harmonic term (constant term) was included in the multi-harmonic expansion of the nonlinear problem, highlighting its importance when the contact interface experiences large normal load variation. The resulting numerical damper kinematics with strong translational and rotational motion, and the global blades frequency response were fully validated experimentally, showing the accuracy of the suggested high detailed explicit UPD modelling approach. {\copyright} 2016},

 abstract = {Friction joints are one of the fundamental means used for the assembly of structural components in engineering applications. The structural dynamics of these components becomes nonlinear, due to the nonlinear nature of the forces arising at the contact interface characterised by stick-slip phenomena and separation. Advanced numerical models have been proposed in the last decades which have shown some promising capabilities in capturing these local nonlinearities. However, despite the research efforts in producing more advanced models over the years, a lack of validation experiments made it difficult to have fully validated models. For this reason, experimental techniques which can provide insights into the local dynamics of joints can be of great interest for the refinement of such models and for the optimisation of the joint design and local wear predictions. In this paper, a preliminary study is presented where ultrasound waves are used to characterise the local dynamics of friction contacts by observing changes of the ultrasound reflection/transmission at the friction interface. The experimental technique is applied to a dynamic friction rig, where two steel specimens are rubbed against each other under a harmonic tangential excitation. Initial results show that, with a controlled experimental test procedure, this technique can identify microslip effects at the contact interface.},

Analysis, have greatly expanded the modeling detail available for such structures.

However, these techniques are limited in their abilities, especially when the structure dynamics

These equations are discretized through a series expansion and Galerkin projection over a chosen amplitude and phase domain, yielding non-linear equations in the expansion coefficients. These equations, when solved numerically, yield an invariant manifold which is accurate to the degree of the expansion, and devoid of the limitations which plague typical asymptotic solutions. Such Galerkin-based solutions may be used to generate accurate reduced-order models for large-amplitude, strongly non-linear motions. This procedure is illustrated using two non-linear examples, a two degree-of-freedom oscillator, and a finite element beam model. The solution convergence and manifold geometry are discussed and the resultant reduced-order models are shown to possess exceptional accuracy over large amplitude ranges.

This approach is advantageous, as the nonlinear interactions present in rotorcraft systems often necessitate large-scale models when traditional finite-element or linear modal expansion methods are applied. These large models are cumbersome and may incur considerable computational cost for accurate simulations. The proposed procedure may ease this computational burden by producing a reduced set of governing equations which correctly account for the nonlinear behavior of the original system. This reduction is achieved through a Galerkin-based solution for the invariant manifold which governs the nonlinear normal mode of interest for the rotor blade. This solution method is primarily numerical, and is much more accurate than the previous asymptotic approaches. Results are shown for an example of a nine meter blade, for which peak to peak blade amplitudes of one meter can be accurately captured using a single nonlinear normal mode. The reduced-order, single degree of freedom model dynamics are shown to be nearly indistinguishable from those of a reference system which possesses 18 degrees of freedom. Though the blade model used here is quite simple in terms of geometry, the reduction method is easily applicable to much more general blade models, as well as to other nonlinear structural systems.},

Phase resonance testing is one method for the experimental extraction of nonlinear normal modes. This paper proposes a novel method for nonlinear phase resonance testing. Firstly, the issue of appropriate excitation is approached on the basis of excitation power considerations. Therefore, power quantities known from nonlinear systems theory in electrical engineering are transferred to nonlinear structural dynamics applications. A new power-based nonlinear mode indicator function is derived, which is generally applicable, reliable and easy to implement in experiments. Secondly, the tuning of the excitation phase is automated by the use of a Phase-Locked-Loop controller. This method provides a very user-friendly and fast way for obtaining the backbone curve. Furthermore, the method allows to exploit specific advantages of phase control such as the robustness for lightly damped systems and the stabilization of unstable branches of the frequency response. The reduced tuning time for the excitation makes the commonly used free-decay measurements for the extraction of backbone curves unnecessary. Instead, steady-state measurements for every point of the curve are obtained. In conjunction with the new mode indicator function, the correlation of every measured point with the associated nonlinear normal mode of the underlying conservative system can be evaluated. Moreover, it is shown that the analysis of the excitation power helps to locate sources of inaccuracies in the force appropriation process. The method is illustrated by a numerical example and its functionality in experiments is demonstrated on a benchmark beam structure.},

Determining frequency response curves is a common task in the vibration analysis of nonlinear systems. Measuring nonlinear frequency responses is often challenging and time consuming due to, e.g., coexisting stable or unstable vibration responses and structure-exciter-interaction. The aim of the current paper is to develop a method for the synthesis of nonlinear frequency responses near an isolated resonance, based on data that can be easily and automatically obtained experimentally. The proposed purely experimental approach relies on (a) a standard linear modal analysis carried out at low vibration levels and (b) a phase-controlled tracking of the backbone curve of the considered forced resonance. From (b), the natural frequency and vibrational deflection shape are directly obtained as a function of the vibration level. Moreover, a damping measure can be extracted by power considerations or from the linear modal analysis. In accordance with the single nonlinear mode assumption, the near-resonant frequency response can then be synthesized using this data. The method is applied to a benchmark structure consisting of a cantilevered beam attached to a leaf spring undergoing large deflections. The results are compared with direct measurements of the frequency response. The proposed approach is fast, robust and provides a good estimate for the frequency response. It is also found that direct frequency response measurement is less robust due to bifurcations and using a sine sweep excitation with a conventional force controller leads to underestimation of maximum vibration response.},

 abstract = {The development of nonlinear modal analysis so far has focused on structures with smooth nonlinearities. However, nonsmooth nonlinearities, which are, for instance, caused by contact interactions are highly relevant in practical applications. This paper proposes a novel numerical approach along with a method for the measurement of nonlinear modes of structures with nonsmooth contact nonlinearities. The proposed numerical method combines the shooting method and the harmonic balance method, yielding a mixed time-frequency domain representation of the system, allowing for an efficient treatment of the nonsmooth contact law within the numerical approach. Moreover, the mass of the system is redistributed such that the contact nodes are massless. Thereby, the dynamic contact problem can be reduced to a quasi-static contact problem. A salient feature of this numerical approach is that the contact problems are solved without the need for any contact parameters, such as penalty or restitution coefficients. Furthermore, the conservative nature of the contact law incorporated in this formulation allows for the calculation of nonlinear modes as periodic solutions of conservative systems. The experimental method relies on a nonlinear phase resonance approach. Hitherto, phase resonance methods have exclusively been applied to systems with smooth nonlinearities. In this study, an automated nonlinear phase resonance approach with phase-controlled excitation is used, providing a robust experimental procedure, which facilitates the treatment of strong nonsmooth nonlinearities, e.g., caused by unilateral constraints inducing impacts. The numerical and experimental methods are demonstrated by an application to a benchmark structure consisting of a beam with one-sided support leading to impacts. It is shown that the numerical method can be applied without the need for any nonlinear system identification effort and the results agree well with the measured nonlinear modes.},

The contact interface elements provided here an exact description of friction and unilateral contact forces at the interacting surfaces, taking into account the influence of the variable normal load on the friction forces, including the extreme cases of separation of the two surfaces. Initial gaps and interferences at the contact nodes, which affect the normal force, as well as the unilateral action of the normal force at the contact surface, are all included in the model. The accurate calculation of the force vector and the tangent stiffness matrix provides a very reliable and fast convergence of the iteration process used in the search for the amplitudes of nonlinear vibrations of bladed disks. Numerical investigations demonstrate excellent performance with respect to speed, accuracy and stability of computation.},

The model condensation allows the size of the nonlinear equations to be reduced to the number of degrees of freedom where nonlinear interaction forces are applied. The analysis of nonlinear forced response for simplified and realistic models of mistuned bladed disks has been performed.

The method allows parametric frequency-domain calculations of the stability loss together with the vibration amplitudes and design parameter values corresponding to the stability boundaries. The tracing algorithm is applied to obtain the trajectories of stability loss points as functions of design parameters. The parametric stability loss is formulated for cases when (i) the design parameters characterize the properties of nonlinear contact interfaces (e.g., gap, contact stiffness, and friction coefficient); (ii) the design parameters describe linear components of the analyzed structure (e.g., parameters of geometric shape, material, natural frequencies, and modal damping); and (iii) these parameters describe the excitation loads (e.g., their level, distribution or frequency). An approach allowing the multiparametric analysis of stability boundaries is proposed. The method uses the multiharmonic representation of the periodic forced response and aimed at the analysis of realistic gas-turbine structures comprising thousands and millions degrees-of-freedom (DOF). The method can be used for the effective search of isolated branches of the nonlinear solutions and examples of detection and search of the isolated branches are given: for relatively small and for large-scale finite element (FE) models. The efficiency of the method for calculation of the stability boundaries and for the search of isolated branches is demonstrated on simple systems and on a large-scale model of a turbine blade.},

The aim of this study is to define in an analytical way these energy dissipation mechanisms which we examine through the analysis of a new benchmark: the flexural vibration of a clamped-clamped beam with original positioning of the interfaces. The joints exhibit the behavior of an interface under constant and uniform normal stress. The stress and strain values are computed at the joints under the assumption of quasi-static motion. This model allows us to understand the evolution of the slip and stick regions along the joint interfaces during the loading process. The expressions of the strain and stress fields during each phase of the loading process are derived. These lead to the quantification of the dissipated energy within the interface. Using this formula, a nonlinear loss factor can then be computed. In the final part of the paper, the dynamic response of the beam is calculated using this nonlinear loss factor. {\copyright} 2010 Imperial College Press.},

 abstract = {High cycle fatigue (HCF) is one of the primary causes of

turbine blade failure. Resonant vibratory stresses contribute

strongly to blade life reduction. Over the past 25 years, a large

amount of research has examined using friction damping to reduce

these stresses, most of which has focused on developing

experimental and low-order computational modeling tools for

blade stress predictions. However, the highly nonlinear and nonsmooth

nature of friction limits the ability of many methods

to produce accurate and robust predictions. Higher-order approaches

such as the finite element method (FEM) can provide

improved predictions at the cost of increased computational time.

Commercial FEM codes use a penalty formulation at the contact

interface and often the user is required to tune the penalty stiffness

to produce meaningful results that compare favorably with

analytical or experimental benchmark data. Our research effort

focuses on implementing a Lagrange-multiplier-based interface

formulation in a commercial FEM code (ANSYS). The approach

removes the penalty stiffness formulation and has been implemented

using ANSYS APDL scripting. Our approach produces

favorable comparisons with experimental data without the need

for parameter tuning, and at the same time, there is sufficient

scope for reducing computational costs. We present comparisons

with experimental data as well as parameter studies on friction

coefficient, platform angle and damper normal load. We expect

this research effort to develop into an accurate passive damping

prediction tool that can be easily integrated with industry-based

tools.},

 abstract = {This paper deals with the dynamics of jointed flexible structures in multibody simulations. Joints are areas where the surfaces of substructures come into contact, for example, screwed or bolted joints. Depending on the spatial distribution of the joint, the overall dynamic behavior can be influenced significantly. Therefore, it is essential to consider the nonlinear contact and friction phenomena over the entire joint. In multibody dynamics, flexible bodies are often treated by the use of reduction methods, such as component mode synthesis (CMS). For jointed flexible structures, it is important to accurately compute the local deformations inside the joint in order to get a realistic representation of the nonlinear contact and friction forces. CMS alone is not suitable for the capture of these local nonlinearities and therefore is extended in this paper with problem-oriented trial vectors. The computation of these trial vectors is based on trial vector derivatives of the CMS reduction base. This paper describes the application of this extended reduction method to general multibody systems, under consideration of the contact and friction forces in the vector of generalized forces and the Jacobian. To ensure accuracy and numerical efficiency, different contact and friction models are investigated and evaluated. The complete strategy is applied to a multibody system containing a multilayered flexible structure. The numerical results confirm that the method leads to accurate results with low computational effort.},

 abstract = {Summary The paper concerns the optimal design and performance evaluation of a Tuned Mass Damper Inerter (TMDI) to reduce dynamic vibrations. The system exploits properties of the inerter, a two-terminal mechanical device able to produce a force proportional to the relative acceleration between terminals, with the ability of generating an apparent mass even two orders of magnitude greater than its own physical mass. A primary single-degree-of-freedom structure is equipped with a classical linear Tuned Mass Damper (TMD), the secondary structure, whose mass is connected to the ground via an inerter. The optimal design of the TMDI is conducted by assuming a white noise process as base input and utilizing three different design methodologies: displacement minimization, acceleration minimization and maximization of the ratio between the energy dissipated in the secondary system and the total input energy. Optimal results obtained with the different methodologies are carried out and compared. Two limit cases are also considered when the inerter is not contemplated: conventional and non-conventional TMDs, characterized by a low and a large mass ratio, respectively. The TMDI performance is evaluated and compared with conventional and non-conventional TMDs; moreover, its robustness is assessed with a sensitivity analysis varying the design parameters. Attention is focused not exclusively on the primary structure response but also on the secondary one. Finally, the effectiveness of the optimally designed TMDI is evaluated having considered earthquake base excitation. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of TMDI systems for dynamic response reduction with superior performances and robustness than classical TMDs. Copyright ? 2017 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

The formulation is based on a non-smooth temporal transformation (NSTT), to replace the independent temporal variable of the problem with two new piecewise-linear periodic temporal variables. As a result, the problem of computing the subharmonic motions is reduced to a set of NBVPs with homogeneous boundary conditions. Some numerical and analytical solutions of the reduced NBVPs are given, and the asymptotic behavior in the limit of large period of the derived analytical approximations is discussed. In particular, the formulation shows a definite connection between vibro-impact oscillations considered in mechanics and strongly nonlinear oscillations close to a heteroclinic orbit. An interesting feature of a family of subharmonic solutions analyzed in this work is that in the limit of large periods it degenerates to the perturbed stable and unstable manifolds of an unstable periodic orbit of the system. {\copyright} 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

 abstract = {Real world systems rarely vibrate at a single resonance frequency and the frequencies drift over

time. Tunable devices exist, but generally need additional energy to achieve frequency adaptation.

This means that the benefits in power output from this tuning need to be large enough to power the

mechanism itself. Passively self-tuning systems go into resonance without requiring active control.

This paper focuses on a passively self-tuning system with a proof mass that can slide freely along a

clamped-clamped beam. Under external vibration, the slider moves along the beam until the system

goes into resonance. A proof-of-concept design is introduced using either a copper or a steel beam

and a 3D-printed ABS thermoplastic proof mass. Successful self-tuning is demonstrated in both cases.

The frequencies range from 80 -- 140 Hz at accelerations as low as 0.007 g rms. Results show the

resonance of the beam and the position of the slider along the beam with time. Furthermore, the

dynamic magnification and the proof mass position at resonance are discussed, together with the

inherent non-linearities of double-clamped beam resonators. The findings support the hypothesis that

the effect of the ratio between proof mass and beam mass outweighs the Duffing spring stiffening

effects.},

 abstract = {Multistability or coexistence of different attractors for a given set of parameters is one of the most exciting phenomena in dynamical systems. It can be found in different areas of science, such as physics, chemistry, biology, economy, and in nature. The final state of a multistable system depends crucially on the initial conditions. From the viewpoint of applications, there are two major issues related to the emergence of multistability. On one hand, this phenomenon often can create inconvenience, as for instance, in the design of a commercial device with specific characteristics, where multistability needs to be avoided or the desired state has to be stabilized against a noisy environment, and on the other hand, the coexistence of different stable states offers a great flexibility in the system performance without major parameter changes, that can be used with the right control strategies to induce a definite switching between different coexisting states. These two examples alone illustrate the importance of multistability control in applied nonlinear science. For the last decade a lot of research has been devoted to the development of control techniques of multistable systems. These methods cover several strategies, going from feedback control methods to nonfeedback, such as periodic or stochastic perturbations capable of changing the coexisting states stability and driving the system from multistability to monostability. We review the most representative control strategies, discuss their theoretical background and experimental realization.},

for the analysis of steady-state vibro-acoustic problems. Conventional

element based prediction methods, such as the finite element method (FEM),

are commonly used, but are restricted to low-frequency applications. The

wave based method (WBM) is an alternative deterministic technique which

is based on the indirect Trefftz approach. The WBM is computationally very

efficient, allowing the analysis of problems at higher frequencies. This dissertation

reports on an extension of the WBM to multi-domain acoustic problems

and problems involving unbounded acoustic fluid domains, such as transmission,

scattering and radiation problems. The efficiency of the WBM is most

pronounced for problems of moderate geometrical complexity. A hybrid finite

element-wave based method combines the strengths of the two methods,

namely, the high computational efficiency of the WBM and the ability of the

FEM to model problems of arbitrary geometrical complexity. Numerical validation

examples show the enhanced computational efficiency of the WBM for

problems of moderate geometrical complexity and of the hybrid method for

real-life engineering problems.},

In our algorithm, SSMs, the smoothest nonlinear continuations of modal subspaces of the linearized system, are constructed up to arbitrary orders of accuracy, using the parameterization method. An advantage of this approach is that the construction of the SSMs does not break down when the SSM folds over its underlying spectral subspace. A further advantage is an automated a posteriori error estimation feature that enables a systematic increase in the orders of the SSM computation until the required accuracy is reached. We find that the present algorithm provides a major speed-up, relative to numerical continuation methods, in the computation of backbone curves, especially in higher-dimensional problems. We illustrate the accuracy and speed of the automated SSM algorithm on lower- and higher-dimensional mechanical systems.},

 abstract = {It is known that the coefficient of friction generally depends on a large number of system and loading parameters. Already Coulomb presented experimental evidence that the static coefficient of friction may depend on time, on normal force, on the contact size, on the nature of contacting materials, and on the presence of intermediate lubricant layers. For the sliding coefficient of friction, he observed the dependence on the sliding velocity as well as the force and size dependencies. Later research has shown that the friction coefficient is very sensitive to the presence of oscillations (including self-excited vibrations). In spite of the practical importance of the problem, no generalized laws of friction or empirical procedures for measuring and representing the law of friction have been developed so far, which included at least the following four parameters: contacting body velocity, normal force, shape (and thus implicitly size), and time. In the present paper, we discuss the question of how the dimension of space of governing parameters can be reduced and if a small set of ``robust governing parameters'' of friction can be identified. We argue that one of such robust governing parameters is the indentation depth (or relative approach) of contacting bodies and discuss further candidates for the role of robust governing parameters. {\copyright} 2016, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

 abstract = {A new frequency-time domain method is proposed

to analyze the periodic forced response of structural

systems undergoing intermittent contacts and frictional

interactions between some of their components. It is

based on a modification of the Hybrid Frequency-Time

(HFT) method developed by the authors for the study

of the dynamics of systems with external, dry-friction

dampers attached. In the approach presented in this

paper, the dynamics of the structure is still described in

the frequency domain by a set of Fourier coefficients

representing the motion of the nonlinear degrees of

freedom (DOFs) where impact or friction occur, but the

corresponding contact forces are no longer taken into

account in the resulting set of nonlinear equations to

be solved. Instead, this new method is based on the

nonlinear kinematics conditions associated with the

contact forces, that is, it solves directly for the nonlinear

DOFs displacements which satisfy the Coulomb friction

and non-penetration conditions associated with these

nonlinear forces. Therefore, this approach circumvents

the numerical problems associated with the handling

of complicated Fourier transforms stemming from nonsmooth

periodic contact forces, a major hindrance to

the efficient numerical solving of the dynamics of such

systems.

Simple spring-mass systems with displacementdependent,

non-smooth nonlinearities are studied in

this paper, as well as an application of the method to

a more realistic finite element model representing two

example shrouded blades impacting each other. These

examples successfully demonstrate the accuracy and

robustness of the method.},

 abstract = {The blades of Iran Montazer-Ghaem-Unit4 power plant failed just 10 h after resuming operation following the last overhaul. The initial investigation showed that the design shortcoming was the main cause of the failure. A series of analytical, finite element and experimental analysis were utilized to determine the steady-state stresses and dynamic characteristic of the blade. It is concluded that the blade fracture was due to high cycle fatigue resulting from a bending mode of resonant vibration which probably caused by aero dynamical disturbances. Moreover the simulation of the blade with final crack conformed that the ductile fracture could be occurred under these stresses. Nevertheless, the vendor did not approve the fracture analysis report especially about the fatigue stresses. So the question rose whether the estimated stresses could impose fatigue crack propagation during 10 h or not. This manuscript attempted to simulate the crack propagation and fatigue life of the blades. The simulation has been done by numerical solution of exact model.

 abstract = {A new 48``steam turbine last stage blade (LSB) has been

developed by the common effort of Skoda Power and Ansaldo

Energia. The successful detuning of eigen-frequencies with

respect to the basic rotational frequency has been achieved by

using interconnecting elements near the mid-span and at the

shroud of blades. Friction forces among the contact elements

resulted from the constraint blade untwist generated by the

centrifugal-force.

FEM calculation of the Campbell and interference diagrams

was followed by a detailed measurement in a specialized

vacuum testing rig. Semiconductor strain gages located near the

blade root were equally spaced around the bladed disc. The

excitation was performed by a high-power variable-frequency

magnet. For the critical 0-node ``umbrella'' shape frequency

both the axial magnetic excitation and the direct torsional

excitation with AC driving motor were applied. Nearly forty

different bladed-disc frequencies grouped into five families

were identified by the FFT analysis. The corresponding modal

shapes were indentified from the relationship between the

excitation and resonance frequencies a using the time offset of

the signal from strain gages distributed along the disc perimeter.

An excellent agreement between calculated and measured

frequencies and nodal shapes was observed. A typical difference

between the predicted and actually measured critical

frequencies did not exceed 3{\%} of the nominal value for the

relevant frequencies. A complementary measurement using tiptiming

technique is currently underway.},

It is shown that applying force impulses which are equally spaced in time, but whose impulsive strength depends in a certain manner on the state-variables of the mechanical system, results in a periodic energy exchange between lower and higher modes of vibration. Moreover, in the theoretical case of Dirac delta impulses, it is possible that no energy crosses the system boundary while energy is transferred across modes, i.e. neither external energy is fed to the mechanical system, nor energy is extracted from the mechanical system. Shifting energy to higher modes of vibration, whose natural damping is larger compared to lower ones, results in a faster dissipation of energy. An analytical stability investigation is presented using the assumption of impulsive forcing of Dirac delta type, which allows deciding easily about the stability by evaluating the eigenvalues of the coefficient matrix of a corresponding set of difference equations. It is shown that the developed impulsive forcing concept is capable to suppress self-excited vibrations of mechanical systems. Some numerical results of a simple mechanical system with two degrees of freedom underline the presented approach.},

@phdthesis{puri2008,
 abstract = {Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH) is a critical consideration in the design of

automotive and aerospace vehicles for comfort, and fatigue of components arising

from interior structural and acoustic pressure fluctuations due to external structural

or acoustic loading. In the low to mid frequency range, current NVH models, obtained

by direct, unsymmetric, coupled Eulerian Finite Element discretization (often

known as the Cragg's u/p unsymmetric formulation) cannot provide a highly accurate

and computationally efficient lower order model suitable for iterative structural

and acoustic design modifications, or for example control applications via state-space

techniques. The task of generating an accurate and a computationally efficient lower

order model is further complicated due to the addition of non-trivial trim details such

as frequency dependent damping resulting in an explicit participation of the damping

matrix in the coupled higher dimensional system. In this thesis, lower order,

fully coupled, structural-acoustic models are developed using a systematic dimension

reduction procedure from the higher dimensional coupled structural-acoustic

system to enable efficient, fully-coupled, undamped and damped structural-acoustic

analysis and optimization.



The proposed dimension reduction techniques do not require the solution of the

traditional coupled or uncoupled eigenvalue problems; but instead are based on implicit, 

low frequency moment matching of the coupled higher dimensional system

matrices via Krylov subspaces. This method matches the input to output characteristic

of the higher dimensional structural-acoustic model and constructs a reduced

order model by removing the uncontrollable, unobservable and weakly controllable,

observable parts without affecting the transfer function of the coupled system. The

new approaches for interior, fully coupled, structural-acoustic analysis are based on

the computation of Arnoldi vectors using one of the several available Arnoldi variants;

which essentially compute orthogonal vectors belonging to the induced Krylov

subspaces. As a consequence, it turns out that a single projection framework is

suitable for all the three possible damping formulations arising in interior structural

acoustics: undamped, constantly damped and linearly damped material models.



To achieve the projected form, either second-order or state-space, five different approaches

based on the Arnoldi process are proposed. The proposed reduction techniques

are applied to six different test cases, ranging from a two dimensional fluid

filled Benchmark problem to a realistic scaled vehicle cabin incorporating adhesively

bonded joints. In the numerical test cases, both air and water are considered for the

fluid medium to test the accuracy and computational efficiency of moment-matching

Arnoldi formulations for weakly and strongly coupled problems. The structural and

acoustic quantities of interest are compared with the direct and uncoupled modal

formulations, where available. Structural-Acoustic reciprocity is considered as a

validation tool for coupled models with acoustic excitation. It is shown that the

moment matching reduced order models preserves the underlying second order form

and the solution state accuracy whilst saving computational times of at least 1-2

orders in magnitude.



Further, a fast and efficient optimization framework is developed to optimize the

lamination angles of a composite structure for reduced interior noise at a representative

location in the fluid domain. In this vibro-acoustic optimization framework, the

primary cost functions are derived based on the reduced order structural-acoustic

models obtained via the Arnoldi based projection formulation to save computational

time whilst maintaining the desired accuracy of required states. The optimization

method in itself is a tailored version of the derivative-free Mesh Adaptive Direct

Search algorithm which allows for both local and global exploration of the design

space at any given iteration of the optimization process. An adaptation to this

method, incorporating the Latin Hypercube Sampling technique is investigated as

a part of the global search step to increase computational efficiency and avoiding

being trapped at local minima. It is numerically demonstrated that by varying the

lamination angles of a composite structure, it is possible to reduce interior noise

levels.},

The switch closes and opens the feedback loop in the dependence of the phase of the output signal, which is measured by a specially designed phase detector. This modification represents a further development of the act-and-wait concept applied to time-delayed feedback controllers. The concept allows to reduce the phase space dimension of time-delayed feedback systems and to significantly simplify the theory. In previous works, the time-delayed feedback loop was tuned on and off periodically, independently of the state of the system. We discuss the advantages of our algorithm with respect to previously considered modifications.

It is confirmed that the Hertz contact law is still suitable to estimate the impact?contact duration of the first sub-impact. The difference between the test impact?contact durations of the subsequent sub-impacts and that of the theoretic results was explained theoretically by a revised impact theory in consideration of beam?s vibration. The occurrence reason of the sub-impact was systematically discussed. It is concluded in this investigation that the sub-impacts are dominated by local contact?impact deformation, but influenced obviously by the global vibration of the flexible structure.

Firstly, a generalized dimensionless model of a two degrees of freedom (DOF) system comprising a harmonically excited linear oscillator (LO) strongly coupled to a VI NES is investigated. Bifurcation analysis and efficiency of Targeted Energy Transfer (TET) around the Slow Invariant Manifold (SIM) are studied with the variation of clearance. As a result, the optimal clearances for periodic and transient excitation are calculated from two transition points of the SIM, respectively. Then the procedure is extended to the case of multiple VI NESs in parallel with the LO. Two principles of additivity and separate activities of VI NESs are verified theoretically. Finally, experiments involving the whole system embedded on an electrodynamic shaker are performed. The results show that the design criteria can not only predict the efficient TET at resonance frequency, but can also achieve an optimal performance in a range of frequencies. Furthermore, the criteria can be straightforward for the application of multiple VI NESs, so as to make VI NESs work robustly under different types of excitation.},

A simplified yet realistic blade model with geometrical nonlinearities is considered. It includes pre-twist, pre-bending and warping, and is duplicated to create a full bladed rotor with cyclically symmetric properties. As the model of the whole structure may become enlarged, it is further reduced via the normal form approach. The harmonic balance method is then employed to obtain periodic solutions, localize bifurcation points and then follow bifurcated branches. These numerical solutions are used in complement with the aforementioned theoretical conditions to investigate the energy transfer properties of the mechanical system. Through these simulations, an effective range of amplitude excitation is defined to obtain internal resonances leading to an overall vibration mitigation of the system.},

In a quasi-static loading limit, the deformation of the rod and hence the frictional dissipation can be solved in closed form. The resulting model is a continuum model of series arrangements of parallel Jenkins elements. For a general class of normal load distributions, the resulting energy loss per forcing cycle follows a power-law and is qualitatively similar to observed experimental findings. Finally, these results are compared with those obtained from a discrete formulation of the rod including inertial effects.

Typical designs serving as the basis for harvesting energy from ambient vibration typically employ a linear oscillator for this purpose, limiting peak harvesting performance to a narrow band of frequencies about the resonant frequency of the oscillator. Herein, in an effort to maximize performance over the broader band of frequency content typically observed in ambient vibration measurements, we employ an essentially nonlinear cubic oscillator in the harvesting device and show that, with proper design, significant performance gains can be realized as compared with a tuned linear attachment. However, we also show that the coexistence of multiple equilibria due to the nonlinearity can degrade system performance, as the system can be attracted to a low amplitude state that provides reduced harvested power. Finally, when multiple equilibria exist in the system, the basins of attraction for the stable states are determined and related to the expected response of the system. {\copyright} 2011 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.},

 abstract = {Structural systems are often composed of multiple components joined together at localized interfaces. Compared to a corresponding monolithic system these interfaces are designed to have little influence on the load carrying capability of the system, and the resulting change in the overall system mass and stiffness is minimal. Hence, under nominal operating conditions the mode shapes and frequencies of the dominant structural modes are relatively insensitive to the presence of the interfaces. However, the energy dissipation in such systems is strongly dependent on the joints. The microslip that occurs at each interface couples together the structural modes of the system and introduces nonlinear damping into the system, effectively altering the observed damping of the structural modes, which can then significantly alter the amplitude of the response at the resonant modal frequencies. This work develops equations of motion for a jointed structure in terms of the structural modal coordinates and implements a reduced-order description of the microslip that occurs at the interface between components. The interface is incorporated into the modal description of the system through an existing decomposition of a series-series Iwan interface model and a continuum approximation for microslip of an elastic rod. The developed framework is illustrated on several examples, including a discrete three degree-of-freedom system as well as the longitudinal deformation of a continuum beam.},

 abstract = {This paper focuses on the formulation and validation of a reduced order model for the prediction of the response - displacements, stresses, fatigue life - of aircraft panels subjected to a severe thermo-acoustic loading. The reduced order modeling starts with a finite element model from a standard package (MSC.NASTRAN) and produces a set of cubic nonlinear differential equations which are efficiently marched in time. The basis for the representation of the displacement field includes transverse deflection modes of the linear panel and some associated in-plane modes (the dual modes). A partial static condensation approach is proposed for the numerically efficient integration of the reduced order model governing equations. Validation cases demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed static condensation and of the good to excellent reliability of the reduced order model for the prediction of the displacements and stresses of panels in the nonlinear range in static and dynamic cases. The computational efficiency of the reduced order model permits the generation of time histories of stresses long enough for the accurate assessment of the fatigue life of panels.},

Analysis based on the principle of conservation of energy reveals a fundamental limit of the effectiveness of any non-linear device over a tuned linear device for such an application. Two types of non-linear stiffness are considered. The first system has a non-linear bi-stable snap-through mechanism. This mechanism has the effect of steepening the displacement response of the mass as a function of time, resulting in a higher velocity for a given input excitation. Numerical results show that more power is harvested by the mechanism if the excitation frequency is much less than the natural frequency. The other non-linear system studied has a hardening spring, which has the effect of shifting the resonance frequency. Numerical and analytical studies show that the device with a hardening spring has a larger bandwidth over which the power can be harvested due to the shift in the resonance frequency.},

Resonance may occur either at a steady operating speed or under transient conditions of operation when the blade passes through a critical speed. Damping plays a significant role in limiting the amplitudes of vibration and stress values. The blade damping mechanism is very complex in nature, because of interfacial slip, material hysteresis, and gas dynamic damping occurring simultaneously. In this paper, a numerical technique to compute the stress response of a turbine blade with nonlinear damping characteristics, during steady and transient operations of the rotor, is presented. Damping is defined as a function of vibratory mode, rotor speed, and strain amplitude. The technique is illustrated by computing the stress levels at resonant rotor speeds for typical operation of a turbomachine.},

@article{rao2003,
 abstract = {Blade fatigue failures are very common in turbomachinery. They are excited by flow path

interference between the stator and rotor stages at nozzle passing frequency and its harmonics.

When the frequency of any of these harmonics coincide with any one of the natural frequencies,

resonance occurs. The high stresses at resonance lead to fatigue problems. The only way by which

the resonant stresses can be controlled is by dissipation of the vibratory energy. Thus damping

becomes an important aspect of the blade design.

For a turbine blade the means by which this vibratory energy could be dissipated is by material

damping, Coulomb damping at the interfaces, gas dynamic damping and possibly impactive

damping. All these damping mechanisms are complex and non-linear in nature. Generally the

aerodynamic damping is very low, and when there is no impact damping, the material and

Coulomb damping between interfacial slipping surfaces are the main sources of dissipation of

energy. A designer usually depends on past experience and test results to estimate the available

damping in limiting the resonant stresses. Attempts have been made to quantify the material

damping using Lazan's damping law or by contact elements using 2D models, see Ref. [1].

However, an application of these procedures to determine the equivalent viscous damping values

in turbine blades is not successfully implemented.

Based on experimental work, Rao et al. [2] quantified blade damping as a function of strain

amplitude in each mode of vibration for different speeds. This non-linear model of damping has

been successfully used in evaluating the resonant stresses, see Ref. [3]. However, it is very

expensive to conduct such tests for each blade stage. Here a method is illustrated to estimate

material damping, friction damping as well as combined material and friction damping using a

finite element code, ANSYS.},

This loss of recoverable energy then determines the maximum possible value for the coefficient of restitution for any impact. In evaluating the radiated energy loss Hunter (1957) used an approximation to the displacement-time relationship in a Hertzian impact so as to obtain an analytic solution to the problem. However, in doing so he derived a force-time relationship which had a different power dependence from that of the Hertz equations. In this paper the energy loss is re-evaluated using Hunter's approximation for the displacement-time relationship but applying it in such a way as to maintain similarity with Hertz equations. This re-evaluation predicts the energy loss as being some 4.5 times greater than predicted by Hunter's analysis. It is shown that the present analysis results in a generally better fit to experimental data.},

This is discussed for discrete systems and reduced order models of continuous systems, for applications ranging from macro- to micro/nanomechanics.

 abstract = {Repeating structures in the form of multiple-bladed rotors are used widely in turbomachinery. Damage to blades can have significant consequences but can be difficult to identify in normal operation. This paper introduces an approach for identifying small defects such as cracks in a repeating structure that may be applicable to the limited data obtainable from developing techniques such as blade tip-timing. In order to understand the key issues involved, this initial work involves a numerical study of a simple comb-like repeating structure rather than a bladed rotor. Changes to the system modeshapes and mode order arising from damage are related to the location and severity of damage. Damage, in the form of small, open cracks, is modelled using different techniques such as material removal, periodic reduction in modulus of elasticity of selected elements at the required location and mass modification. Damage indices based on differences in the Modal Assurance Criterion (MAC) that give a measure of the change in the modeshapes are introduced. MAC matrices are obtained using a reduced number of data points. The damage index is obtained from the Frobenius norm of MAC matrix subtracted from (1) the AutoMAC of reference model without crack and (2) the identity matrix. A clear correlation between the damage indices and crack depth / location is shown. In order to account for mistuning in real repeating structures, the performance when the assembly is subjected to inhomogeneous temperature distributions is also considered.

Control-based continuation is a recently developed approach for testing nonlinear dynamic systems in a controlled manner and exploring their dynamic features as system parameters are varied. In this paper, control-based continuation is adapted to follow the locus where system response and excitation are in quadrature, extracting the backbone curve of the underlying conservative system. The method is applied to a single-degree-of-freedom oscillator under base excitation, and the results are compared with the standard resonant-decay method.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a systematic method for exploring the nonlinear dynamics of multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) physical experiments. To illustrate the power of this method, known as control-based continuation (CBC), it is applied to a nonlinear beam structure that exhibits a strong 3:1 modal coupling between its first two bending modes. CBC is able to extract a range of dynamical features, including an isola, directly from the experiment without recourse to model fitting or other indirect data-processing methods.



Previously, CBC has only been applied to (essentially) single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) experiments. This is the first experimental demonstration of CBC in the presence of complex MDOF response features such as internal resonance, isola, and Neimark-Sacker bifurcations. In this paper we show that the feedback-control methods and path-following techniques used in a SDOF context can equally be applied to MDOF systems. A low-level broadband excitation is initially applied to the experiment to obtain the requisite information for controller design and, subsequently, the physical experiment is treated as a ``black box'' that is probed using CBC. The invasiveness of the controller used is analysed and experimental results are validated with open-loop measurements. Good agreement between open- and closed-loop results is achieved, though it is found that care needs to be taken in dealing with the presence of higher-harmonics in the force applied to the structure.},

Considering midplane stretching due to tension in the shape memory alloy wires provides an ability to model damping in a nonlinear analysis although there is no distinct damping expression in the governing equation of motion. The results show a gradual decrease in the free vibration amplitude of the beam until it reaches a fully elastic response while this cannot be seen in linear models.

 abstract = {The introduction of longer last stage blading in steam

turbine power plant offers significant economic and

environmental benefits. The modern trend, adopted by most

leading steam turbine manufacturers, is to develop long last

stage moving blades (LSMB) that feature a tip shroud. This

brings benefits of improved performance due to better leakage

control and increased mechanical stiffness. However, the

benefits associated with the introduction of a tip shroud are

accompanied by an increased risk of blade flutter at high mass

flows. The shroud is interlocked during vibration, causing the

first axial bending mode to carry an increased, out of phase,

torsional component. It is shown that this change in mode

shape, compared to a unshrouded LSMB, can lead to

destabilising aerodynamic forces during vibration. At a

sufficiently high mass flow, the destabilising unsteady

aerodynamic work will exceed the damping provided by the

mechanical bladed-disk system, and blade flutter will occur.

Addressing the potential for flutter during design and

development is difficult. Simple tests prove inadequate as they

fail to reveal the proximity of flutter unless the catastrophic

condition is encountered.

A comprehensive product validation programme is

presented, with the purpose of identifying the margin for safe

operation in respect to blade flutter. Unsteady CFD predictions

are utilised to identify the mechanisms responsible for the

unstable aerodynamic condition, and the particular modes of

vibration that are most at risk. Using this information, a

directed experimental technique is applied to measure the

combined aerodynamic and mechanical damping under

operating conditions. Results are presented which demonstrate

the identification of the aeroelastic stability margin for a new

A test rig is built corresponding to a double sphere--plane contact preloaded by the weight of a moving cylinder. Typical response curves are obtained for several input levels. Time traces and spectral contents are explored. Both amplitude and phase of harmonics of the dynamic response are investigated.



Linearized resonance frequency and damping ratio are identified from the almost linear behaviour under very small input amplitude. Increasing the external input amplitude, the softening behaviour induced by Hertzian non-linear stiffness is clearly demonstrated. The resonance peak is confined to a narrow frequency range. Jump discontinuities are identified for both amplitude and phase responses. The forced response spectrum exhibits several harmonics because of a non-linear Hertzian restoring force. Numerical simulations show a very good agreement with experimental results.



For higher input amplitudes, the system exhibits vibro-impacts. Loss of contact non-linearity clearly dominates the dynamic behaviour of the vibro-impacting contact and leads to a wide frequency range softening resonance. The spectral content of the response is dominated by both the first and the second harmonics. Evolution of the experimental downward jump frequency vs. input amplitude allows the identification of the non-linear damping law during intermittent contact. Simulations of the vibro-impacting Hertzian contact are performed using a shooting method and show a very good agreement with experimental results.},

 abstract = {The focus of the present investigation is on the assessment and modeling of the local (spanning only a few blades) and global (encompassing the entire disk) effects of mistuning on the forced response of bladed disks. To this end, the concept of localization is first revisited and a new measure of this effect is introduced in terms of the number of blades the mistuning of which actually affects the forced response of a central blade. Using this new metric, it is demonstrated that high responding blades typically exhibit a high level of localization and that the reverse is not necessarily true. Thus, localization is not only disk dependent but also varies from blade-to-blade on the same disk. This observation is then used to validate a partial mistuning approach to the determination of the maximum amplitude of response over the entire population of disks. The results of this study indicate that the largest amplification due to the mistuning occurs at very strong blade-to-blade coupling levels, at the contrary of a general perception, but is associated with large mistuning levels. Finally, the above phenomenological observations are used to devise a modeling technique of both local and global components of mistuning. An example of application is presented that demonstrates the high accuracy of this approach through the entire blade-to-blade coupling domain.},

 abstract = {Damage detection by means of non-destructive testing plays an important role in ensuring the integrity of machine elements and structures. Vibration testing is an effective means of detecting crack development in structures. In this paper the effect of crack closure on the dynamic behaviour of cantilever beams is studied. Since the crack opens or closes depending on the direction of the vibration, the beam exhibits bilinear characteristics. The aim of the paper is to analyze the system response by using bispectral analysis which forms a subset of higher order statistical analysis. The study has been conducted both on simulated and experimental vibration signals. Firstly, a simplified model is employed to simulate the bilinear behaviour of a beam with a closing crack. The model is an oscillator with a bilinear restoring forcing function. The analysis of the forced vibrations of the model is performed by means of the harmonic balance method showing the occurrence of harmonics in the response spectrum which are strictly related to the bilinear nature of the model. Moreover, an experimental test carried out on a straight beam with a fatigue crack is presented. The beam is excited with white noise by means of a vibration shaker. The bispectral analysis performed both on the model and the actual structure shows high sensitivity to the non-linear behaviour of the system: that is to say, to the presence of the fatigue crack in the structure. In particular, the interactions between the frequency components contained in the signal response are analyzed. The results provide a possibility of using the bispectral analysis technique to detect damages in structures. {\copyright} 1998 Academic Press.},

The new formulation is based on a fully consistent reduction approach and the reduced matrices so-obtained are exactly dual to the Craig--Bampton reduced matrices. The new free interface substructuring method proposed here is thus more natural then classical free interface synthesis procedures and leads to simpler reduced matrices.

 abstract = {Recent numerical simulations have indicated the potential of plasma-based active flow control for improving the efficiency of highly loaded low-pressure turbines. The configuration considered in the current and earlier simulations correspond to previous experiments and computations for the flow at a Reynolds number of 25,000 based on axial chord and inlet conditions. In this situation, massive separation occurs on the suction surface of each blade due to uncovered turning, causing blockage in the flow passage. It was numerically demonstrated that asymmetric dielectric-barrier-discharge actuators were able to mitigate separation, thereby decreasing turbine wake losses. The present investigation extends this work by investigating a number of plasma-based flow control strategies. These include the chordwise location of actuation, spanwise periodic arrays of actuators, multiple actuation in the streamwise direction, and spanwise-direct actuation. The effect of alternate plasma-force models is also considered. Solutions were obtained to the Navier-Stokes equations, which were augmented by source terms used to represent plasma-induced body forces imparted by an actuator on the fluid. The numerical method utilized a high-fidelity time-implicit scheme, employing domain decomposition to carry out calculations on a parallel computing platform. A high-order overset grid approach preserved spatial accuracy in locally refined embedded regions. Features ofthe flow fields are described, and resultant solutions are compared to each other, with a previously obtained control case, and with the base line situation where no control was enforced.

 abstract = {Flutter of bladed disks is an instability mechanism where the aerodynamic flow pumps energy into the blade vibration. This energy is dissipated through dry friction, normally at the blade-disk attachment, and this balance defines the blade vibration amplitude that sets in. The magnitude of this final vibration amplitude is crucial to correctly estimate the blade fatigue life. In the context of the European project FUTURE, a series of flutter experiments were carried out for a realistic low-pressure turbine with different intentional mistuning patterns. To analyze the results, a simple 3 degrees of freedom per sector mass-spring model is set up with the experimental configuration parameters. This mass-spring system still requires very long integration times due to: (i) the large difference between the fast elastic oscillation time and the slow time associated with the aerodynamic instability, friction, and mistuning, and (ii) the presence of many aerodynamically unstable modes with very similar growth rates. A multiple-scale method is applied to further simplify the mass-spring system. The blade elastic oscillation is filtered out, and the resulting asymptotic reduced order model reduces considerably the integration time required to reach a converged solution. It is found that the final vibration state of the mistuned problem depends on the selected initial conditions, so the model is run for a large number of random initial conditions to explore the possible final states. The asymptotic model gives results that show a good agreement with the experimental measurements, and it also allows to explain the origin of the peaks in the travelling wave content of the final solution found in the experiment for the intentionally mistuned configurations.},

 abstract = {At certain flight conditions, the complexities of the aerodynamic flow-field can result in large loading differentials which may pose a serious risk to the airframe structural integrity, often exciting an aeroelastic buffeting instability or limit-cycle response. Such phenomena are typically beyond the scope of linearized aerodynamics models, and hence an emerging field of computational aeroelasticity is concerned with the modeling of nonlinear aerodynamic flows. In particular, the application of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) frameworks is gaining popularity since it can provide a high-fidelity description of the spectral content present in arbitrary flow environments. While these CFD-based aeroelasticity frameworks are mainly based on the Euler or Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) models, it is becoming increasingly clear that certain classes of flows are better covered by models in which all or a part of the turbulence spectrum is spatially and temporally resolved in at least a portion of the flow domain. The deficiency of adopting higher-fidelity Scale-Resolving Simulation (SRS) models in numerical aeroelastic frameworks is the intensive computational time requirement, especially for the development and implementation of control strategies for buffet suppression. This paper presents a preliminary description of a hybrid time-frequency domain approach, which iteratively interfaces ANSYS FLUENT{\texttrademark} and the frequency-domain aeroservoelastic response code DYNRESP through the Increased-Order Modeling (IOM) strategy. The coupling is applied to a Generic delta wing model with a twin vertical tail configuration, which undergoes severe torsional response due to the breakdown of Leading-Edge Extension (LEX) vortices at high angle-of-attack. The preliminary results show a clear tendency for convergence of the linearized model in predicting the complex aerodynamic flow-field providing scope for the future development of the proposed hybrid strategy. {\copyright} 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Harmonic and broadband random excitations are performed experimentally in order to show the softening effect of the rubber isolator for high amplitudes of displacement and to show the temperature dependency of its mechanical properties. Firstly, the rubber isolator is modeled as a one degree-of-freedom system, whose stiffness and damping depend only on the amplitude of the relative displacement of the joint. The relationship between the stiffness and the damping versus the amplitude of the relative displacement of the rubber isolator is updated via experiments. Secondly, the Harmonic Balance Method (HBM) and the shooting method are presented and extended to take into account both harmonic and random excitations. A modification of the nonlinear methods is necessary in order to recover the information concerning the displacement amplitude. Moreover, for random excitations, a periodogram strategy is used to ensure a good estimate of the resulting Power Spectral Density (PSD). Finally, comparisons between experiments and simulations are undertaken. Good correlations are observed for harmonic and broadband random excitations, thus validating the modeling of the rubber isolator and the proposed nonlinear methodology.},

 abstract = {In nuclear power plant turbosets, the design-basis accident

consists of a blade-off on the low pressure turbine last stage.

During the accidental shutdown, a severe rotor-casing interaction

may occur at critical speeds due to large shaft line displacements

originated by a high unbalance excitation. The contact

between the shaft and the stator, also called the diaphragm in

this study, induces an important angular deceleration rate and

greatly modifies the turbogenerator dynamics including the amplitude

of the loads in the bearings. Therefore the main objective

is to verify that the designed turbine is capable of going through

critical speeds without catastrophic consequences for the shaft

line. To this end, a model of a turbogenerator has been developed

to compute rotor speed transients by considering the rotating

speed of the rotor as an unknown, which allows for the angular

deceleration due to rubbing to be calculated in a more realistic

fashion. Lagrange multipliers method is applied to compute

contact forces. The diaphragm, which is a non-rotating bladed

disks assembly, is modeled by curved and straight beams, and

different assumptions for the contact detection are studied to find

a compromise between CPU time and accuracy. Results of the

numerical tool show that the contact forces are sensitive to the

retained assumptions only when heavy rub occurs. Nevertheless,

the rotating speed and bearing loads are computed with a satisfactory

accuracy, even with an approximation on contact detection

that saves CPU time.},

 abstract = {In this article, the vibrational response of a cracked cantilevered beam to harmonic forcing is analysed. The study has been performed using a finite element model of the beam, in which a so-called closing crack model, fully open or fully closed, is used to represent the damaged element. Undamaged parts of the beam are modelled by Euler-type finite elements with two nodes and 2 d.f. (transverse displacement and rotation) at each node. Recently the harmonic balance method has been employed by other researchers to solve the resulting non-linear equations of motion. Instead, in this study, the analysis has been extended to employ the first and higher order harmonics of the response to a harmonic forcing in order to characterize the non-linear behaviour of the cracked beam. Correlating the higher order harmonics of the response with the forcing term the so-called higher order frequency response function (FRFs), defined from the Volterra series representation of the dynamics of non-linear systems, can be determined by using the finite element model to simulate the time domain response of the cracked beam. Ultimately the aim will be to employ such a series of FRFs, an estimate of which in practice could be measured in a stepped sine test on the beam to indicate both the location and depth of the crack, thus forming the basis of an experimental structural damage identification procedure.

 abstract = {An efficient methodology for predicting the nonlinear forced vibration response of a

turbine engine rotor with a cracked blade is presented and used to investigate the effects

of the damage on the forced response. The influence of small random blade-to-blade

differences (mistuning) and rotation on the forced response are also considered. Starting

with a finite element model, a hybrid-interface method of component mode synthesis

(CMS) is employed to generate a reduced-order model (ROM). The crack surfaces are

retained as physical degrees of freedom in the ROM so that the forces due to contact in

three-dimensional space can be properly calculated. The resulting nonlinear equations of

steady-state motion are solved by applying an alternating frequency/time-domain method,

which is much more computationally efficient than traditional time integration. Using this

reduced-order modeling and analysis framework, the effects of the cracked blade on the

system response of an example rotor are investigated for various mistuning levels and

rotation speeds. First, the advantages of the selected hybrid-interface CMS method are

discussed and demonstrated. Then, the resonant frequency shift associated with the stiffness

loss due to the crack and the vibration localization about the cracked blade are

thoroughly investigated. In addition, the results of the nonlinear ROMs are compared

with those obtained with linear ROMs, as well as blade-alone ROMs. It is shown that

several key system vibration characteristics are not captured by the simpler models, but

that some insight into the system response can be gained from the blade-alone response

predictions. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that while the effects of the crack often

appear similar to those of mistuning, the effects of mistuning and damage can be distinguished

by observing and comparing the response across multiple families of system

modes.},

 abstract = {This work deals with order reduction of large scale linear time-invariant systems in second

order form while preserving the second order structure. The proposed methods are

based on matching some of the characteristic parameters (moments and Markov parameters)

of the original and reduced systems using the Krylov subspaces, knowing that

the Krylov subspaces are the main kernel of the most attractive methods to reduce large

scale systems.



Two main approaches are proposed in this dissertation. In the first method, the order

of the original second order model is reduced by applying a projection directly to the

original system. To find the projection matrices, an extension of Krylov subspace called

Second Order Krylov Subspace is defined. This generalization involves two matrices and

some starting vectors. To match the desired characteristic parameters, particular Second

Order Krylov Subspaces are used where the projection matrices are calculated using an

extension of the Arnoldi or Lanczos algorithms. In SISO case, this method matches at

most Q characteristic parameters which is less than the standard Krylov methods in state

space by which at most 2Q characteristic parameters are matched where Q is the order

of the reduced system.



In the second method, the number of matching parameters is increased up to almost

double in a cost of more computational effort. This approach consists of three steps:

(i) conversion of the second order model into state space representation. (ii) reduction

by a Krylov subspace method, preserving the second order character inside. (iii) back

conversion into a second order representation by applying a similarity transformation. In

this method at most 2Q $-$ 1 characteristic parameters match in SISO case.



The accuracy and suitability of the proposed methods are demonstrated through different

examples of different orders and the results are compared and discussed.},

A one-story prototype-building model is used. The structure is subjected to a base excitation and is strengthened by SMA diagonal bracing wires. Constitutive behavior of SMA wires used in the study was experimentally characterized to properly model the SMA super- or pseudoelastic material properties and results were compared with the numerical simulation based on theoretical SMA constitutive models by Lexcellent and Bourbon ((1996).

Journal of Intelligent Material Systems and Structures, 4: 229). The Single-degree-of-freedom structural system was also experimentally calibrated to determine the structural parameters. Both the experimentally calibrated structural model and SMA constitutive model were then employed in numerical simulation to predict dynamic response of the building structure with SMA bracing wires subjected to a base input and results showed a good agreement with experimental data. The results were also compared with both cases of conventional steel bracing wires and no bracing at all. The results showed that SMA passive devices may be effectively used to suppress vibration by introducing additional stiffness to shift the system natural frequency away from the resonance and/or providing additional energy dissipation by its superelastic hysteresis. The SMA damping is adaptive and is especially attractive for the case when the loading is random in nature. When an unexpected excitation causes excessive vibration, more energy will be dissipated through larger SMA superelastic hysteretic loops and therefore, the vibration will eventually be mitigated. Numerical simulation also showed that the SMA device dissipated more energy than the viscous damping in the case studied. {\copyright} 2002 Sage Publications.},

 abstract = {Fretting wear is a very important phenomenon occurring in

bladed disks. It causes that blades must be replaced in turbomachines

during their life-cycle. Methods exist to predict frettingwear

in quasi-static analysis. However they don't predict all

the phenomena observed in blade attachments on real turbomachines.

That's why this study assumes that dynamics plays a

role in fretting-wear. This paper is devoted to the realistic modelling

and calculation of fretting-wear and dynamical response

of structures in unilateral contact with friction. Vibration and

wear phenomena present very different scales both in time and

space. Therefore the difficulty is in finding methods that enable

one to solve the non-linear problem with a good compromise between

the approximationsmade about the dynamical aspects and

those linked with fretting-wear issues. Here, phenomenological

examples are studied. They involve a small number of degrees

of freedom with a view to understanding the complex coupling

between vibration and fretting-wear. This way, they will show

the relative importance of parameters.},

 abstract = {Assembled bladed disks have many contact interfaces

(blade-disk joint, blade shrouds, friction dampers...). Because of

relative displacements at these interfaces, fretting-wear occurs,

which affects negatively the lifetime of the structure. Methods

exist to predict fretting-wear in quasi-static analysis. However

they don't predict all the phenomena observed in blade attachments

on real plants. This paper studies the assumption of a responsibility

of dynamics for fretting-wear damage.

A numerical treatment of fretting-wear under vibrational

loading is proposed. The method is based on the Dynamical Lagrangian

Frequency Time method. It models unilateral contact

through Coulomb's friction law. The basic idea is to separate

time in two scales, slow scale for tribological phenomena and fast

scale for dynamics. For a chosen number of periods of vibration,

a steady state is assumed and the variables are decomposed in

Fourier series. An Alternating Frequency Time procedure is performed

to calculate the non-linear forces. Then, a Hybrid Powell's

algorithm is used as solver. An analytical expression of the

Jacobian matrix decreases the duration of calculations. This expression

is also used to predict new relative displacement at the

interfaces due to the increase of wear depth. This method is similar

to a prediction-correction method, with wear depth as the

term of continuation.

Numerical investigations on a bladed-disk with friction con-

tact interfaces illustrate the performances of this method and

show the coupling between dynamical and tribological phenomena.},

 abstract = {In modern turbomachinery, abradable materials are implemented

on casings to reduce operating tip clearances and mitigate

direct unilateral contact occurrences between rotating and stationary

components. However, both experimental and numerical

investigations revealed that blade/abradable interactions may

lead to blade failures.

In order to comprehend the underlying mechanism, an accurate

modeling of the abradable removal process is required.

Time-marching strategies where the abradable removal is modeled

through plasticity are available but another angle of attack is

proposed in this work. It is assumed that the removal of abradable

liners shares similarities with machine tool chatter encountered

in manufacturing. Chatter is a self-excited vibration caused by

the interaction between the machine and the workpiece through

the cutting forces, and the corresponding dynamics are efficiently

captured by delay differential equations. They differ from ordinary

differential equations in that previous states of the system

are involved. This mathematical framework is here employed for

the exploration of the blade stability during abradable removal.

The proposed tool advantageously features a reduced computational

cost and consistency with existing time-marching solution

methods. Potentially dangerous interaction regimes are

accurately predicted and instability lobes match both flexural

and torsional modal responses. Essentially, the regenerative nature

of chatter in machining processes can also be attributed to

abradable coating removal in turbomachinery.},

 abstract = {In the present work, the focus is made on the occurrence of

precessional motions of the shaft---whirling motions---in bladeddisk

assemblies, initiated by direct blade/casing contacts in one

stage of an aircraft engine. These contact events are favored

by increasingly reduced blade-tip clearances and are expected

to occur during standard operating conditions. However, it has

been shown that potentially harmful interactions may arise and

threaten the engine structural integrity.

A 2D in-plane model of an aircraft engine fan stage is built

with a set of curved beams for the casing and an assembly straight

beams for the bladed-disk. The flexibility of the shaft is reflected

by two linear springs attached to the center node of the disk.

Contact is initiated through a prescribed casing distortion and

the two structures are then left free to interact. Equations of

motion are solved via explicit time-marching and contact forces

are computed with Lagrange multipliers method allowing to fully

satisfy non-penetration conditions. Friction is accounted for

through a Coulomb law and permanent sliding is assumed.

Three types of regimes are identified, namely: (1) damped,

(2) sustained, (3) divergent, and both forward and backward shaft

precessional motions are witnessed. It is shown that the vibratory

response of the bladed-disk mainly lies on the first nodal diameter

these contact events is highlighted, in particular in the presence

 abstract = {We study the stiffening and damping effects that local essentially nonlinear attachments can have on the dynamics of a primary linear structure. These local attachments can be designed to act as nonlinear energy sinks (NESs) of shock-induced energy by engaging in isolated resonance captures or resonance capture cascades with structural modes. After the introduction of the NESs, the effective stiffness and damping properties of the structure are characterized through appropriate measures, developed within this work, which are based on the energy contained within the modes of the primary structure. Three types of NESs are introduced in this work, and their effects on the stiffness and damping properties of the linear structure are studied via (local) instantaneous and (global) weighted-averaged effective stiffness and damping measures. Three different applications are considered and show that these attachments can drastically increase the effective damping properties of a two-degrees-of- freedom system and, to a lesser degree, the stiffening properties as well. An interesting finding reported herein is that the essentially nonlinear attachments can introduce significant nonlinear coupling between distinct structural modes, thus paving the way for nonlinear energy redistribution between structural modes. This feature, coupled with the well-established capacity of NESs to passively absorb and locally dissipate shock energy, can be used to create effective passive mitigation designs of structures under impulsive loads. {\copyright} 2012 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.},

Dynamic equations are turned into a set of non-linear algebraic equations using the harmonic balance method. Then periodic solutions are sought using a recursive application of a global analysis method for various pulsation values. This exhibits disconnected branches in both the free undamped case (non-linear normal modes, NNMs) and in a forced case which shows the link between NNMs and forced response.

It is then legitimate to look for all the solutions of such systems, that is to have a global analysis approach.

We propose in this paper a way to find all T-periodic solutions---where T is known---of a non-linear dynamical system. This method is compared to three other approaches and is shown to be the most efficient on a Duffing oscillator.

 abstract = {In this work, we study how a contact/impact nonlinearity interacts with a geometric cubic nonlinearity in an oscillator system. Specific focus is shown to the effects on bifurcation behavior and secondary resonances (i.e., super- and sub-harmonic resonances). The effects of the individual nonlinearities are first explored for comparison, and then the influences of the combined nonlinearities, varying one parameter at a time, are analyzed and discussed. Nonlinear characterization is then performed on an arbitrary system configuration to study super- and sub-harmonic resonances and grazing contacts or bifurcations. Both the cubic and contact nonlinearities cause a drop in amplitude and shift up in frequency for the primary resonance, and they activate high-amplitude subharmonic resonance regions. The nonlinearities seem to never destructively interfere. The contact nonlinearity generally affects the system's superharmonic resonance behavior more, particularly with regard to the occurrence of grazing contacts and the activation of many bifurcations in the system's response. The subharmonic resonance behavior is more strongly affected by the cubic nonlinearity and is prone to multistable behavior. Perturbation theory proved useful for determining when the cubic nonlinearity would be dominant compared to the contact nonlinearity. The limiting behaviors of the contact stiffness and freeplay gap size indicate the cubic nonlinearity is dominant overall. It is demonstrated that the presence of contact may result in the activation of several bifurcations. In addition, it is proved that the system's subharmonic resonance region is prone to multistable dynamical responses having distinct magnitudes.},

 abstract = {The concept of nonlinear modes is useful for the dynamical characterization of nonlinear mechanical systems. While efficient and broadly applicable methods are now available for the computation of nonlinear modes, nonlinear modal testing is still in its infancy. The purpose of this work is to overcome its present limitation to conservative nonlinearities. Our approach relies on the recently extended periodic motion concept, according to which nonlinear modes of damped systems are defined as family of periodic motions induced by an appropriate artificial excitation that compensates the natural dissipation. The particularly simple experimental implementation with only a single-point, single-frequency, phase resonant forcing is analyzed in detail. The method permits the experimental extraction of natural frequencies, modal damping ratios and deflection shapes (including harmonics), for each mode of interest, as function of the vibration level. The accuracy, robustness and current limitations of the method are first demonstrated numerically. The method is then verified experimentally for a friction-damped system. Moreover, a self-contained measure for estimating the quality of the extracted modal properties is investigated. The primary advantages over alternative vibration testing methods are noise robustness, broad applicability and short measurement duration. The central limitation of the identified modal quantities is that they only characterize the system in the regime near isolated resonances.},

To this end, we design a new test rig that exhibits a large extent of friction-induced damping (modal damping ratio up to 15{\%}) and frequency shift by 36{\%} (considered the first bending mode). The specimen, called RubBeR, is a cantilevered beam under the influence of dry friction, ranging from full stick to mainly sliding. With the specimen's design, the measurements are well repeatable for a system subjected to dry frictional force. Then, we apply the method to the specimen and show that single-point excitation is sufficient to track the modal properties even though the deflection shape changes with amplitude. Computed frequency responses using a single nonlinear-modal oscillator with the identified modal properties agree well with measured reference curves of different excitation levels, indicating the modal properties' significance and accuracy.},

We demonstrated how very small control forces were sufficient to excite or suppress flutter oscillations. Limit cycle oscillations occurred under free and forced turbulent boundary layer transition in a perforated wall test-section. Flutter calculations based on experimental aerodynamic forces yield stability limits which show good agreement with directly measured experimental flutter values. The results indicate that flow separation at the trailing edge, and the interactions between the shock and the marginal region of separated flow beneath it, may be responsible for limiting the amplitude of the observed limit cycle oscillations.},

 abstract = {The aeroelastic behavior of wing models is nonlinear particularly in the transonic speed range. The interaction between aerodynamic and structural forces can lead to the occurrence of Limit-Cycle Oscillations (LCOs). If in addition the wing model is flexible and backward swept, the kinematic coupling between bending and torsion makes the situation even more complex. In the research project ``Aerostabil'' such a wing was investigated, which was equipped with pressure transducers in three sections and accelerometers. The experiments were performed in the adaptive test section of the transonic wind tunnel TWG in G{\"o}ttingen. Already Dietz et al. (2003) have reported about experimental details and preliminary results. Based on these data Bendiksen (2008) studied numerically LCO-flutter behavior using a very similar, theoretical model (G-wing) and Stickan et al. (2014) used the original data as a LCO flutter test case. The influence of flexibility on the steady aerodynamics of the wing was described in Schewe {\&} Mai (2018). In this paper now the flutter experiments with the same flexible model were analyzed systematically in the transonic range 0.84 {\textless}Ma {\textless}0.89 and for six angles of attack from 1.46°to 2.7°. Maps of stability, LCO amplitudes and instantaneous pressure distributions are presented. It was found that unstable regions are islands, whose extent depends on the angle of attack. A LCO test case, already treated in the literature is examined in more detail. The analysis of the time functions showed that during LCO-flutter the motion induced aerodynamic sectional lift forces particularly in the outer wing are asymmetric and thus acting as amplitude limiter. The reason for the asymmetry lies in the shock/boundary layer interaction. The test case, containing the stages of built-up and the transition to the limit cycle provides an excellent opportunity for improving our knowledge about LCOs and for code validation purposes.},

There is no doubt that the method of multibody systems is most efficient for the dynamical analysis of the overall motion. However, during impact energy is lost macromechanically measured by the coefficient of restitution. This coefficient has to be estimated from experiments and experience but cannot be computed within the multibody system approach. The impacts, on the other hand, are generating waves in the bodies which are propagating until they are vanishing due to material damping. These high frequency phenomena are analyzed using wave propagation, modal approach and finite elements. The results of the simulation on the fast time scale are used to compute the coefficient of restitution which is then fed back to the multibody system equations and the solution continues on the related slow time scale. The efficiency of the approach presented is shown for the impact of a steel sphere on four different shaped aluminum bodies of comparable mass. The simulation results are verified with experiments performed on different time scales, too. Using the impact of a double pendulum on a stop as example, the application of the multiscale approach to a multibody system is shown.},

In this paper a multiscale simulation approach is used in order to evaluate the coefficient of restitution numerically including the phenomena of wave propagation and, in particular, plastic deformation. For the numerical investigation four different models are presented in the following: a completely nonlinear finite element (FE) model, a modal model of the elastic parts of the body combined with a nonlinear FE model of its contact region, a modal model with quasi-static FE contact, and a modal model with an elastostatic Hertzian contact law. The modal models with FE contact are very efficient for investigating repeated impacts of the bodies including the deformation history of the contact region. Simulations and experiments of repeated frictionless impacts on aluminum bodies show, due to plastic deformation of the contact area, an increase of the coefficient of restitution with increasing numbers of impacts. Finally, plastic deformation does no longer spread out and a stationary value is reached. In the stationary phase impacts on a compact body shows no energy loss, while for impacts on a slender body the remaining energy loss during impact is purely due to wave propagation phenomena. Simulations show a strong dependency of the coefficient of restitution on the yield stress of the used material, that is also verified by experiments.},

The algorithms are easy to implement and require only minimal a priori knowledge of the system. Most importantly, the methods do not depend on an a priori co-ordinate transformation. The methods are applied to a number of illustrative examples from non-linear electrical engineering and the results show that the methods are efficient and reliable.

 abstract = {Friction damping is widely used to reduce vibration amplitudes and the resulting dynamic stresses. Before experimental tests of a new friction damper can be conducted, numerical simulations are carried out to evaluate the damping performance. Many systems with friction contacts can be divided into the linear parts of the structure and a nonlinear contact model. Therefore the simulation model usually comprises a modal description of the linear structures, a rigid body model of the friction dampers and contacts with elasticity and friction [1].

In this paper an identification procedure is presented that allows the determination of contact parameters from measured frequency response functions. The procedure involves calculation of the model's frequency response by the Harmonic Balance Method (HBM) and the Method of the Harmonic Balance with Higher Harmonics (HHBM). The identification results are gained from measurements at a pair of blades coupled either by shrouds [2] or by underplattform dampers [1].},

At simulations a close description of the forces in the friction contact and a mathematical implementation of the mechanical contact model is necessary to optimize the friction damping devices. In this paper experimental measurements of heated blades coupled by tip shrouds are presented.

 abstract = {Typically surge events in compressors are investigated

only from the aerodynamic point of view (aerodynamic

instability or lack of surge margin). For this assessment various

methods exist during the design phase. For the analysis of the

structural impact of surge in this phase the situation is more

challenging, because an analytical prediction of the blade

loading during surge is difficult to obtain. In this paper a

combined analysis of aerodynamic and structural aspects of

surge in compressor rotor blades of advanced axial flow

compressors with state-of-the-art numerical procedures is

presented and compared to extensive strain-gauge

measurements.

The unsteady aerodynamic excitation of a compressor rotor

blade during surge is determined with a numerical procedure

which allows calculating the unsteady flow field in a

compression system. Blade rows of the compressor are

simulated by appropriate loss/deviation characteristics covering

both the normal and the unstable operating regime of the

compressor, including reversed flow conditions. Elements

adjacent to the compressor such as inlet pipes, exit volumes and

throttles are modeled as required to include their impact on the

systems dynamic behavior. The unsteady flow field within the

system is determined by solving the unsteady conservation laws

for compressible, inviscid flow. Blade forces are determined

from the change of aerodynamic momentum across a blade

row.

The resulting forces in axial and circumferential direction

are used as an input for a direct transient Finite-Element stress

analysis. The resulting forces are applied to the blades. The

results of the Finite-Element analysis are compared with

experimental results from a compressor test rig. Stress is

measured by strain-gauges in various positions on the blades. In

addition, transient pressure is recorded. Measurements are

taken during normal operation of the compressor as well as

during surge. It is shown that the procedure is able to predict

the vibration stress level of the blades satisfactorily.},

blisks is well known. Most of the mistuning studies so far done

are based on assumed statistical distributions of the

eigenfrequencies. But is important to know the real

eigenfrequency distribution of the blades of blisks as they come

out of the manufacturing process or after they are in service for

some time and have experienced erosion, wear and FOD. Some

of the current analytical procedures for mistuning calculations

need the blade-alone frequencies, such as the reduced-order

code Turbo-Reduce which is used in the subsequent analysis.

One way to determine the eigenfrequency distribution is to

ping-test every blade while damping all other blades. This

procedure is very tedious and may take several days, depending

on the number of blades. Further, it is very difficult to eliminate

the influence of the disc and to obtain the pure blade-alone

eigenfrequencies.

In this paper a method for the analytical determination of

the eigenfrequency distribution based on optical measurements

is described. Starting from the point-cloud a procedure to obtain

a FEM-Model of all blades of a blisk is presented. As the

procedure can partly be run as a batch-job, the time to

determine the eigenfrequency distribution is drastically reduced

The procedure is applied to a real blisk and the calculated

eigenfrequencies are compared with the measured frequencies.

eigenfrequency distribution.},

@article{Schoenenborn.2012,
 abstract = {The prediction of blade loads during surge is still a challenging task. In the literature, the blade loading during surge is often referred to as ``surge load,'' which suggests that there is a single source of blade loading. In the second part of our paper it is shown that, in reality, the ``surge load'' may consist of two physically different mechanisms: the pressure shock when the pressure breaks down and aeroelastic excitation (flutter) during the blow-down phase in certain cases. This leads to a new understanding of blade loading during surge. The front block of a multistage compressor is investigated. For some points of the backflow characteristic, the quasi steady-state flow conditions are calculated using a Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS)-solver. The flow enters at the last blade row, goes backwards through the compressor and leaves the compressor in front of the inlet guide vane. The results show a very complex flow field characterized by large recirculation regions on the suction sides of the airfoils and stagnation regions close to the trailing edges of the airfoils. Based on these steady solutions, unsteady calculations are performed with a linearized aeroelasticity code. It can be shown that some of the rotor stages are aerodynamically unstable in the first torsional mode. Thus, in addition to the pressure shock, the blades may be excited by flutter during the surge blow-down phase. In spite of the short blow-down phase typical for aero-engine high pressure compressors, this may lead to very high blade stresses due to high aeroelastic excitation at these special flow conditions. The analytical results compare very well with the observations during rig testing. The correct nodal diameter of the blade vibration is reproduced and the growth rate of the blade vibration is predicted quite well, as a comparison with tip-timing measurements shows. A new flutter region in the compressor map was experimentally and analytically detected.},

 abstract = {The ability to model nonlinear structures subject to random excitation is of key importance in designing hypersonic aircraft and other advanced aerospace vehicles. When a structure is linear, superposition can be used to construct its response to a known spectrum in terms of its linear modes. Superposition does not hold for a nonlinear system, but several works have shown that a system's dynamics can still be understood qualitatively in terms of its nonlinear normal modes (NNMs). This work investigates the connection between a structure's undamped nonlinear normal modes and the spectrum of its response to high amplitude random forcing. Two examples are investigated: a spring-mass system and a clamped-clamped beam modeled within a geometrically nonlinear finite element package. In both cases, an intimate connection is observed between the smeared peaks in the response spectrum and the frequency-energy dependence of the nonlinear normal modes. In order to understand the role of coupling between the underlying linear modes, reduced order models with and without modal coupling terms are used to separate the effect of each NNM's backbone from the nonlinear couplings that give rise to internal resonances. In the cases shown here, uncoupled, single-degree-of-freedom nonlinear models are found to predict major features in the response with reasonable accuracy; a highly inexpensive approximation such as this could be useful in design and optimization studies. More importantly, the results show that a reduced order model can be expected to give accurate results only if it is also capable of accurately predicting the frequency-energy dependence of the nonlinear modes that are excited. {\copyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

@article{schw1999a,
 abstract = {The approach most widely used for the modelling of flexible bodies in multibody systems has been called the floating frame of reference formulation. In this methodology the flexible body motion is subdivided into a reference motion and deformation. The displacement field due to deformation is approximated by the Ritz method as a product of known shape functions and unknown coordinates depending on time only. The shape functions may be obtained using finite-element-models of flexible bodies in multibody systems, resulting in a detailed system representation and a high number of system equations. The number of system equations of such a nodal approach can be reduced considerably using a modal representation of deformation. This modal approach, however, leads to the fundamental problem of selecting the shape functions.

The floating frame of reference formulation is reviewed here using a generic flexible body model, from which the various body models used in multibody simulations may be derived by formulation of specific constraint equations. Special attention is given in this investigation to the following subjects:

bull The separation of flexible body motion into a reference motion and deformation requires the definition of a body reference frame, which in turn affects the choice of shape functions. Some alternatives will be outlined together with their advantages and disadvantages.

bull Assuming the body deformation to be small, the system equations can be linearized. This may require considering geometric stiffening terms. The problem of how to compute these terms has been solved in literature on the instability of structures under critical loads. For finite element models the geometric stiffening terms are obtained from the tangential stiffness matrix.

bull The generality of the flexible body model allows the definition of an object oriented data base to describe the system bodies. Such a data base includes a general interface between multibody- and finite-element-codes.

bull By combining eigenfunctions and static deformation modes to represent body deformation one obtains a set of so-called quasi-comparison functions. When selected properly these functions can be shown to improve the representation of stresses significantly.},

Highly sophisticated software codes are available today for this nonlinear analysis but their correct use requires a good understanding of the correct model generation and the input parameters involved to ensure a reliable prediction of the blade behaviour. The aim of the work described in this paper is to determine the suitability of current modelling approaches and to enhance the quality of the nonlinear modelling of turbine blades with underplatform dampers. This includes an investigation of a choice of the required input parameters, an evaluation of their best use in nonlinear friction analysis, and an assessment of the sensitivity of the response to variations in these parameters. Part of the problem is that the input parameters come with varying degrees of uncertainty, since some are experimentally determined, others are derived from analysis and a final set are often based on estimates from previous experience. In this investigation the model of a commercial turbine bladed disc with an underplatform damper is studied and its first flap, first torsion and first edgewise modes are considered for 6EO and 36EO excitation. The influence of different contact interface meshes on the results is investigated, together with several distributions of the static normal contact loads to enhance the model setup and hence increase accuracy in the response predictions of the blade with an underplatform damper. A parametric analysis is carried out on the friction contact parameters and the correct setup of the nonlinear contact model to determine their influence on the dynamic response and to define the required accuracy of the input parameters.},

At first, a conventional validation of a linearized model of the system is performed at low amplitudes to ensure the correct modal basis for model reduction. After that, the nonlinear behavior around the fundamental mode is analyzed in detail. Frequency responses for different excitation levels and backbone curves are measured and assessed regarding repeatability and robustness of the measurement chain. Among other effects, overhanging branches of the frequency response were encountered. Nonlinear, amplitude-dependent modal frequencies and damping ratios are identified from the backbone curves.

This paper deals with an alternative concept, called collocated constraints approach. We present index-2 and index-1 formulations in combination with implicit Runge--Kutta methods. Compared with the direct discretization of the index-3 DAE system, the proposed method enforces also the constraints on velocity and---in case of the index-1 formulation---the constraints on acceleration level. The proposed method may very easily be implemented in standard Runge--Kutta solvers. Here, we only discuss mechanical systems. The presented approach can, however, also be applied for solving nonmechanical higher-index DAE systems.},

 abstract = {This paper presents an integrated methodology for the analysis of operationally-used turbine blades, incorporating aerodynamic and multiple structural simulations. In jet engines, blade rubbing and erosion lead to deviations of the blade geometry. The presented functional simulations are conducted in order to predict the influence of wear on the performance of turbine blades based on these geometric variations. A numerical simulation of the investigated turbine blades using CFD show the change of aerodynamic performance and the flow field due to wear. Additionally, the deviations of the blade geometry lead to a different pressure and temperature distribution on the blade surface, which is used as input for the structural simulations. The change in geometry, surface pressure and temperature lead to a change in vibration behavior of the blade. Particularly the eigenfrequencies and excitation are affected. This is incorporated into the analysis by performing a structural vibration simulation of a complete bladed disk, using component mode synthesis and wave base substructuring. The mistuning effects are analyzed statistically using the Monte Carlo method. The change in vibration amplitudes influences crack opening and closing for a single blade under thermo-mechanical load. These processes, including thermal expansion, are investigated using the extended finite element method. Two real turbine blades are used to compare the characteristics of a new and a used blade. {\copyright} 2017 The Authors.},

 abstract = {The traditional measurement techniques to acquire the linear dynamic response of a single component are well established and have been in use for many decades to provide reliable input data for model updating. The measurement of assembled structures normally follows a very similar approach, although the presence of joints can introduce a nonlinear dynamic behaviour, which impacts the measurement results. Applying traditional linear test methods to a highly nonlinear structure, such as a dovetail joint in an aircraft engine blade-disk connection, does not necessarily take the special features of the nonlinear response into account and may lead to unreliable data. This is particularly true, if modal information such as damping are required. The influence of the measurement setup and the test procedures must be well understood for an accurate measurement. In this paper the influence of the different measurement components on a simple clamped beam and a compressor blade dove tail test rig will be investigated. A particular focus will be on the support of the test rig, the location and control of the excitation and the influence of the accelerometer on the response. Based on the findings an approach will be recommended that allows a reliable measurement of the dynamic behaviour of this heavily nonlinear structure. {\copyright} 2015, Conference Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Mechanics Series.

challenging problem to the designers of turbomachinery

in the literature to model mistuning. The vast majority of

these efforts have been applied to bladed disk type

well known. The approach resolves the non periodic

features as a set of nonsymmetric reaction forces, which

are expanded as a series of Fourier harmonics, so that the

symmetry of the periodic structure is restored. Modal

sensitivities of the reaction forces are employed which

facilitate the solution of the single sector equations of

The key of this approach is the augmentation of conventional basis functions with others having appropriate discontinuities at the locations of nonlinearity. A Galerkin solution using the above combination of basis functions appears to capture the dynamics of the system very efficiently---employing small basis sets. This method is particularly useful for problems of structural dynamics, but may have application in other fields as well. For problems involving small amplitude dynamics, when one employs as a basis the eigenmodes of a reference linear system plus the discontinuous (joint) modes, the resulting predictions, though still nonlinear, are approximated well as linear combinations of the eigenmodes. This is in good agreement with the experimental observation that jointed structures, though demonstrably nonlinear, manifest kinematics that are well described using eigenmodes of a corresponding system where the joints are replaced by linear springs.},

The loss of kinetic energy which is described by the coefficient of restitution is due to the initiation of waves and plastic deformation of the colliding bodies. Especially in the case of slender bodies a large amount of energy is transformed into waves. For the numerical investigation a combination of a modal approach describing the global elastodynamic behavior of the bodies and a finite element model for the contact region, including the effects of plasticity, is used. The investigation includes repeated impacts with identical initial conditions with the exception of the deformation history of the contact region due to previous impacts. The simulations of repeated impacts on different aluminum rods show, due to plastic deformation of the contact area and the resulting residual stresses, an increase of the coefficient of restitution with the number of impacts until a stationary value is reached. Finally, plastic deformation does not spread out and all energy loss is due to wave propagation. The numerical investigations are verified by experiments.},

A main topic is the multi-scale simulation approach for the numerical evaluation of the coefficient of restitution using additional simulations on a fast time scale. Different models on the fast time scale are proposed and techniques for experimental validation of the models are given. Many numerical and experimental results for impacts of two and more bodies are presented. Thereby the efficiency and accuracy of the multi-scale simulation approach are verified; the influence of physical parameters on the impact process as well as the agreement of the instantaneous and continuous impact modelling are demonstrated.

 abstract = {Engineering surfaces can be characterized as more or less randomly rough. Contact between engineering surfaces is thus discontinuous and the real area of contact is a small fraction of the nominal contact area. The stiffness of a rough surface layer thus influences the contact state as well as the behavior of the surrounding system. A contact model that takes the properties of engineering surfaces into account has been developed and implemented using finite element software. The results obtained with the model have been verified by comparison with results from an independent numerical method. The results show that the height distribution of the topography has a significant influence on the contact stiffness but that the curvature of the roughness is of minor importance. The contact model that was developed for determining the apparent contact area and the distribution of the mean contact pressure could thus be based on a limited set of height parameters that describe the surface topography. By operating on the calculated apparent pressure distribution with a transformation function that is based on both height and curvature parameters, the real contact area can be estimated when the apparent contact state is known. The model presented is also valid for cases with local plastic flow in the bulk material.},

Two of them are based on series expansions: Picard iteration using Chebyshev series and Incremental Harmonic Balance (IHB), in which the non-linear differential equation is transformed into a set of algebraic ones that are solved iteratively. The third method is based on a fourth order (Houbolt's scheme) and an eighth order backward finite difference method (FDM). Each method is presented first, and then applied to specific examples. It is shown: (1) that the Picard method is not valid for solving implicit equations containing large non-linear inertial terms; (2) that the IHB method yields accurate periodic solutions, together with the frequency of oscillation, and the dynamical stability of the system may be assessed very easily; and (3) that both Houbolt's and the eighth order scheme can be used to compute time histories of initial value problems, if the time step is properly chosen. Finally, it is also illustrated how the combination of IHB and FDM can be a powerful tool for the analysis of non-linear vibration problems defined by implicit differential equations (including also explicit ones), since bifurcation diagrams of stable and unstable periodic solutions can be computed easily with IHB, while periodic and non-periodic stable oscillations may be obtained with FDM.},

 abstract = {Lightweight structures which consist to a large extent of carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP), often lack sufficient damping behavior. This also applies to hybrid laminates such as fiber metal laminates made of CFRP and aluminum. Since they are usually prone to vibrations due to their high stiffness and low mass, additional damping material is required to meet noise, vibration and harshness comfort demands in automotive or aviation industry. In the present study, hybrid carbon fiber elastomer metal laminates (HyCEML) are investigated which are intended to influence the damping behavior of the laminates by an elastomer interlayer between the CFRP ply and the aluminum sheets. The damping behavior is based on the principle of constrained layer damping. To characterize the damping behavior, dynamic mechanical analyses (DMA) are performed under tension on the elastomer and the CFRP, and under three point bending on the hybrid laminate. Different laminate lay-ups, with and without elastomer, and two different elastomer types are examined. The temperature and frequency dependent damping behavior is related to the bending stiffness and master curves are generated by using the time temperature superposition to analyze the damping behavior at higher frequencies. A numerical model is built up on the basis of DMA experiments on the constituents and micro mechanical studies. Subsequently, three point bending DMA experiments on hybrids are simulated and the results are compared with the experimental investigations. In addition, a parameter study on different lay-ups is done numerically. Increasing vibration damping is correlated to increasing elastomer content and decreasing elastomer modulus in the laminate. A rule of mixture is used to estimate the laminate loss factor for varying elastomer content. {\copyright} 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

The non-linear mode concept is applied to analyze the steady state responses of non-linear systems driven by a harmonic force. In the experimental context, the present modal identification method permits one to obtain the non-linear modal parameters from frequency response tests. By comparison with other methods, the proposed methods appear very interesting in regard to computational time, formulation, and they necessitate fewer computer resources. An experimental work on the steady state response of a beam with local non-linear stiffness is reported to justify the methods. Many aspects of theoretical results, such as the dependence of resonance frequency on the amplitude of vibration and the downward and upward jump phenomena are observed experimentally. The experimental results are in good agreement with theoretical predictions based upon the non-linear modal superposition approach.},

@phdthesis{seve2004,
 abstract = {Bladed  disk  vibration  amplitudes  are  known  to  be  seriously  amplified  and 

varied  from  blade  to  blade due  to  the  scatter  in  the  blade  geometry  or due  to 

variations  in  material  properties.  The  phenomenon  of  having  non-identical 

blades due  to  these variations  is  called mistuning.  Since mistuning  can  lead  to 

forced  response amplitudes which  are much  larger  than  those predicted  for  a 

tuned  assembly,  additional  dissipation  elements  (e.g.,  friction  dampers)  are 

sometimes integrated into the bladed disk assembly. 



The problem  of  controlling  and predicting  the vibration amplitudes  of  bladed 

disks has been a primary concern of many  research studies. As a  result several 

numerical models have been developed to represent the bladed disk assemblies 

to facilitate prediction of the relevant behaviour. Since so much depends on the 

reliability  of  these  components, however, manufacturers  are disinclined  to use 

these models,  however  complicated,  in  their  designs  unless  or  until  they  are 

proved to be accurate representations of the real behaviour. In other words, the 

model proposed must demonstrably be capable of predicting the response of the 

real bladed disk within  the  tolerances  set by  the manufacturer. The process of 

achieving  this  situation  is  called  ``validation''.  Since  it  is  an  expensive  and 

difficult process, generally it has been largely ignored and a combination of over 

conservative  designs  and  ``fire  fighting''  procedures  in  service  has  been  the 

practice. 



This study aims to validate the numerical models developed for blade vibration 

response  predictions  at  Imperial  College  via  a  carefully  designed  and  wellcontrolled

  test  rig. Using such an experimental  facility,  it  is made  sure  that  the 

experiments  are  carried  out  in  the presence of physical phenomena  accounted 

for  in  predictions  and  none  other.  Two  integral  bladed  disks  (blisks),  one  for 

mistuning  and  one  for  damping  investigations,  are  designed  and  used  in  a 

specially designed  test  rig. Non-contacting measurement  (LDV)  and  excitation 

(magnetic)  techniques  are  employed  so  as  not  to modify  the  dynamics  of  the 

blisks.  A  method  of  measuring  blade  vibration  under  rotation,  regardless  of 

rotational speed is presented. A comprehensive test design is carried out prior to 

real  tests  using  updated  blisk  models  to  maximise  the  efficiency  of  the 

measurements.  Through  an  extensive  test  campaign,  the  ability  of  numerical 

models  to predict  forced  response  of  the  blisks  for  several mistuning patterns 

and when fitted with friction dampers, is demonstrated in a systematic series of 

tests. The sensitivity of the forced response to various ways of blisk tuning and 

variations in forcing filed are also studied in this project.},

@misc{sext2002a,
 abstract = {In turbomachinery one major problem is still the

calculation and the optimization of the spatial vibrations of

mistuned bladed disk assemblies with friction contacts.

Friction contacts are widely used to reduce dynamic stresses in

turbine blades. Due to dry friction and the relative motion of

the contact planes, energy is dissipated. This effect results in a

reduction of blade vibration amplitudes.

In the case of a tuned bladed disk, cyclic boundary

conditions can be used for the calculation of the dynamic

response. For a mistuned bladed disk, the complete system has

to be modeled and simulated. To reduce the computation time

the so-called substructure method is applied. This method is

based on the modal description of each substructure, especially

disk and blades, combined with a reduction of the degrees of

freedom, to describe the dynamics of each component. The

spatial dynamical behavior of each component is considered

and described by the mode shapes, natural frequencies and

modal damping ratios. Using the Harmonic Balance Method

the nonlinear friction forces can be linearized. From here it is

possible to calculate the frequency response functions of a

mistuned bladed disk assembly with friction contacts.

In many cases Monte-Carlo simulations are used to find

regions, where the system response is sensitive to parameter

uncertainties, like the natural frequencies of the blades. These

simulations require a large computation time. Therefore, an

approximate method is developed to calculate the envelopes of

the frequency response functions for statistically varying

natural frequencies of the blades. This method is based on a

sensitivity analysis and the Weibull-distribution of the

vibration amplitudes. From here, a measure for the strength of

localization for mistuned cyclic systems is derived. Regions,

where localization can occur with a high probability, can be

calculated by this method. The mean value and the standard

deviation of the vibration amplitudes are calculated by

simulation and by the approximate method. The comparisons

between the approximate method and the Monte-Carlo

simulations show a good agreement. Therefore, applying this

method leads to remarkable reduction of computation time and

gives a quick insight into the system behavior. The

approximate method can also be applied to systems, that

include the elasticity of the disk and/or the coupling by shrouds

or other friction devices.},

 abstract = {Friction contacts are used to transmit forces or to dissipate energy. A better understanding

of friction phenomena can result in improvements like the reduction of

noise and maintenance costs, increased life time of machines and improved energy

efficiency. There exists a rich literature on friction. Depending on the features of

the friction contact, different contact models are applied and dependent on the

contact model, different solution methods are preferred. The aim of this book is to

describe an efficient procedure to model dynamical contact problems with friction.

This procedure is applied to different practical problems and verified by experiments.

The dynamics of the elastic bodies in contact are described by a reduced order

model through the so called modal description, to speed up calculations. This description

is presented in Chap. 2. In Chap. 3 the generalized contact model is developed,

which includes the main physical effects like contact elasticity, roughness,

friction characteristics etc.. The contact planes are discretized and a point

contact model is applied to each area element. The thermomechanics of the contact

is investigated, as well as the calculation of wear. The application of the combined

procedure of the point contact model and the modal description of the elastic

components are illustrated by three different examples. An impact- and friction

oscillator, see Chap. 4, is investigated in the time domain, while the friction

damping of elastic structures with expanded friction contacts is analyzed within

the frequency domain, see Chap. 5. The stationary rolling contact is presumed to

calculate the wear of wheel-rail-systems, see Chap. 6.

 abstract = {In this paper, a review of past and recent developments in the dynamics of flexible multibody systems is presented. The objective is to review some of the basic approaches used in the computer aided kinematic and dynamic analysis of flexible mechanical systems, and to identify future directions in this research area. Among the formulations reviewed in this paper are the floating frame of reference formulation, the finite element incremental methods, large rotation vector formulations, the finite segment method, and the linear theory of elastodynamics. Linearization of the flexible multibody equations that results from the use of the incremental finite element formulations is discussed. Because of space limitations, it is impossible to list all the contributions made in this important area. The reader, however, can find more references by consulting the list of articles and books cited at the end of the paper. Furthermore, the numerical procedures used for solving the differential and algebraic equations of flexible multibody systems are not discussed in this paper since these procedures are similar to the techniques used in rigid body dynamics. More details about these numerical procedures as well as the roots and perspectives of multibody system dynamics are discussed in a companion review by Schiehlen [79]. Future research areas in flexible multibody dynamics are identified as establishing the relationship between different formulations, contact and impact dynamics, control-structure interaction, use of modal identification and experimental methods in flexible multibody simulations, application of flexible multibody techniques to computer graphics, numerical issues, and large deformation problem. Establishing the relationship between different flexible multibody formulations is an important issue since there is a need to clearly define the assumptions and approximations underlying each formulation. This will allow us to establish guidelines and criteria that define the limitations of each approach used in flexible multibody dynamics. This task can now be accomplished by using the ldquoabsolute nodal coordinate formulationrdquo which was recently introduced for the large deformation analysis of flexible multibody systems.},

 abstract = {The floating frame of reference formulation which is widely used in flexible multibody simulations leads to a highly non-linear inertia matrix. This matrix which exhibits a strong inertia coupling between the reference motion and the elastic deformation can be expressed in terms of a unique set of inertia shape integrals that depend on the assumed displacement field. In this paper, we demonstrate that the floating frame of reference formulation leads to the same dynamic relationship obtained using large deformation finite element formulations. This result clearly demonstrates that the floating frame of reference formulation can also be used in the large deformation analysis of constrained flexible bodies provided that no infinitesimal or finite rotations are used as nodal coordinates; instead, displacements and slopes are used to describe the element configuration. The relationship between the local and the global slopes is defined and used to establish a coordinate transformation which is used to demonstrate the equivalence of the dynamic relationships and the inertia forces obtained using two different finite element formulations. Using this equivalence relationship, a simple and systematic procedure for evaluating all the inertia shape integrals that appear in the floating frame of reference formulation from the constant mass matrix that appears in linear structural dynamics is developed. In order to develop this procedure, the concepts of the local and global shape functions are introduced. The local shape function, which is used in the floating frame of reference formulation, does not have any rigid body modes and is defined using an appropriate set of reference conditions. The global shape function, on the other hand, has a complete set of rigid body modes that can describe an arbitrary rigid body displacement. The analysis presented in this paper demonstrates that the floating frame of reference formulation does not lead to a separation between the rigid body motion and the elastic deformation, and in such a formulation, the reference motion cannot be considered as the rigid body motion of the deformable body.},

@article{shab2007,
 abstract = {This paper presents an overview of research and development efforts that are currently being devoted to integrate large deformation finite element formulations with flexible multibody system algorithms. The goal is to develop computer simulation capabilities for the analysis of physics and engineering models with significant details. The successful development of such new and integrated algorithms will also allow modeling and simulation of systems that cannot be solved using existing computer algorithms and codes. One of the main difficulties encountered in this integration process is attributed to the fact that the solution procedures used in finite element codes differ significantly from those used in general-purpose flexible multibody system codes. Finite element methods employ the corotational formulations that are often used with incremental solution procedures. Flexible multibody computer codes, on the other hand, do not, in general, use incremental solution procedures. Three approaches are currently being explored by academic institutions and the software industry. In the first approach, gluing algorithms that aim at performing successful simulations by establishing an interface between existing codes are used. Using different coordinates and synchronizing the time stepping are among several challenging problems that are encountered when gluing algorithms are used. In the second approach, multibody system capabilities are implemented in existing finite element algorithms that are based on large rotation vector formulations. For the most part, corotational formulations and incremental solution procedures are used in this case. In the third approach, a new large deformation finite element formulation that can be successfully implemented in flexible multibody system computer algorithms that employ nonincremental solution procedures is introduced. The approach that is now being developed in several institutions is based on the finite element absolute nodal coordinate formulation. Such a formulation can be systematically implemented in general-purpose flexible multibody system computer algorithms. Nonlinear constraint equations that describe mechanical joints between different bodies can be formulated in terms of the absolute coordinates in a straightforward manner. The coupling between the motion of rigid, flexible, and very flexible bodies can also be accurately described. The successful integration of large deformation finite element and multibody system algorithms will lead to a new generation of computer codes that can be systematical and efficiently used in the analysis of many engineering applications.},

 abstract = {Mistuning or blade to blade variation in jet-engine bladed-disks can lead to large changes in engine performance. Even the small random mistuning associated with manufacturing tolerances can significantly change both stability boundaries and forced response. This thesis addresses two questions. Analysis: given any mistuning (random or intentional), what is the resulting change in performance? And passive control: can intentional mistuning be used to improve stability and forced response in a robust manner?



A general framework based on symmetry arguments and eigenvalue/vector perturbations is presented to answer both questions. Symmetry constrains all facets of mistuning behaviour and provides simplifications for both the analysis and control problems. This is combined with the eigenvalue/vector perturbation which captures the nonlinear mistuning dependence and solves the analysis problem. It is shown that intentional mistuning can provide robust damping and so guarantee improved stability and forced response under fixed manufacturing tolerances. Results are demonstrated on a high-fidelity low-order model derived from computational-fluid-dynamic data.},

Thus, on the achievement of a specified displacement, the direction of motion is reversed using the simple impact rule. The coefficient of restitution for this impact, r, is taken to be small. For r = 0 the motions of the system can be studied using a one-dimensional mapping. Analysis of this map shows that stable periodic orbits exist at almost all forcing frequencies but that transient nonperiodic or chaotic motions can also occur. Moreover, over certain (narrow) frequency windows arbitrarily long stable periodic motions exist. These results are then extended to the case r $\not=$ 0, small.},

This work was motivated by experimental studies at NASA, which demonstrated the effectiveness of these types of absorbers for reducing resonant transverse vibrations in periodically excited rotating plates. Here we show how an idealized model can be used to describe the essential dynamics of these systems, and used to predict absorber performance. The absorbers use centrifugally induced restoring forces so that their nonimpacting dynamics are tuned to a given order of rotation, whereas their large amplitude dynamics involve impacts with the primary flexible system. The linearized, nonimpacting dynamics are first explored in detail, and it is shown that the response of the system has some rather unique features as the hub rotor speed is varied. A class of symmetric impacting motions is also analyzed and used to predict the effectiveness of the absorber when operating in its impacting mode. It is observed that two different types of grazing bifurcations take place as the rotor speed is varied through resonance, and their influence on absorber performance is described. The analytical results for the symmetric impacting motions are also used to generate curves that show how important absorber design parameters---including mass, coefficient of restitution, and tuning---affect the system response. These results provide a method for quickly evaluating and comparing proposed absorber designs.},

In this paper these results are extended to include a static coefficient of friction different from the dynamic one. More importantly, the asymptotic stability of the steady state motions and some transient behaviors are also determined. It is shown that for positive viscous damping the non-sticking steady state solutions of the same period as the forcing are nearly always asymptotically stable, but that for negative viscous damping, which may arise from aerodynamic forces [2], such motions can become unstable. By using bifurcation theory it is shown that new behaviors, such as aperiodic motions containing two distinct frequency components, can result from such dynamic instabilities. It is also shown that the symmetric motions with two stops per period can be unstable and that pairs of unsymmetric motions are born at the bifurcation points.},

The method is constructive for weakly non-linear systems and provides the physical nature of the normal modes along with the non-linear differential equations which govern their dynamics. It also provides the non-linear co-ordinate transformation which relates the original system co-ordinates to the modal co-ordinates. Using this transformation, we demonstrate how an approximate non-linear version of superposition can be employed to reconstruct the overall motion from the individual non-linear modal dynamics. The results presented herein for non-linear systems reduce to modal analysis for the linearized system when non-linearities are neglected, even though the approach is entirely different from the traditional one. The tools employed are from the theory of invariant manifolds for dynamical systems and were inspired by the center manifold reduction technique. In this paper the basic ideas are outlined, a few examples are presented and some natural extensions and applications of the method are briefly described in the conclusions.},

 abstract = {A definition and a constructive methodology for normal nodes of motion are developed for a class of vibratory systems the dynamics of which are governed by non-linear partial differential equations. The definition for normal modes is given in terms of the dynamics on two-dimensional invariant manifolds in the system phase space. These manifolds are a continuation of the planes which represent the well-known normal modes of the linearized system. A local asymptotic approximation of the geometric structure of these manifolds can be obtained by using an approach which follows that used for generating center manifolds. The procedure also provides the non-linear ordinary differential equations which govern individual modal dynamics and a physical description of the system configuration when it is undergoing a modal motion. In this paper, the general theory is described for the application of vibrations of continuous media, but it can easily be extended to other situations. In order to demonstrate the power of the approach and its unique procedural aspects, three examples involving beam vibrations are worked out in detail. The examples are conservative, simply supported beams. The first demonstrates the methodology for a linear beam model, the second is a beam on a non-linear elastic foundation, and the third example is a beam with non-linear torsional springs attached at each end. In these examples, the simplicity of the mode shapes of the linearized model yields relatively simple calculations that do not obscure the important features of the procedure.},

The analysis is based on the measurement of displacement ratio of the contacting elastic structures as a function of frequency due to light impulse excitation at a single point on any of the two elastic structures. The theoretical analysis depends on a very simple model of a two-degree-of-freedom system where two solid friction models are adopted in the analysis of the mathematical model. Several experiments are presented to illustrate the dominant friction mechanism of contacting surfaces within the micro slip regime in a frequency range of oscillation up to 400 Hz. It was shown experimentally that the solid friction model behaves in a way that is described as structural (hysteretic) damping. In other words, the energy dissipated due to dry friction during micro slip regime does not depend on the relative velocity between the two contacting surfaces but it is proportional to their relative displacements. The determination of the contact stiffness and damping loss factor in addition to their variation with the applied normal load was also shown.},

Accurate modeling of such devices requires knowledge of contact parameters such as contact stiffness and contact damping, which are not readily available. In this paper, an experimental method based on contact resonance is developed to extract the contact parameters of realistic rough surfaces under lightly loaded conditions. Both Hertzian spherical contacts and flat rough surfaces in contact under normal loads of up to 1000 mN were studied. Due to roughness, measured contact stiffness values are significantly lower than theoretical values predicted from smooth surfaces in contact. Also, the measured values favorably compare with theoretical values based on both Hertzian and rough contact surfaces. Contact damping ratio values were found to decrease with increasing contact load for both Hertzian and flat surfaces. Furthermore, Hertzian contacts have larger damping compared to rough flat surfaces, which also agrees with the literature. The presence of minute amount of lubricant and wear debris at the interface was also investigated. It was found that both lubricant and wear debris decrease the contact stiffness significantly though only the lubricant significantly increases the damping.},

Prior attempts in designing energy harvesters with broadband response have met with practical challenges in terms of low output power, large mass and weight, and small improvements in bandwidth. Here, we report a breakthrough in demonstrating ultra-wide bandwidth piezoelectric energy harvesters through the automatic resonance tuning (ART) phenomenon. ART provides energy harvester ability to adjust its natural frequency in conjunction with ambient vibration without human intervention or additional tuning energy. The ART energy harvester utilizes the motion of the mobile proof mass in a doubly clamped oscillating beam structure to modulate the natural frequency of the beam. Detailed investigations are conducted in providing a fundamental understanding of the operation mechanism of the ART harvester by invoking beam dynamics over a wide range of vibration conditions. It is shown that bandwidth of the ART harvester (36 Hz) is 1400{\%} larger compared to the fixed resonance energy harvester. The practical feasibility of the ART mechanism is demonstrated by evaluating the performance of the harvester mounted on a rotary pump. The results demonstrate that ART mechanism can provide the much-needed breakthrough in the deployment of mechanical energy harvesters for naturally occurring vibrations. {\copyright} 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Such flows are not simulated with enough efficiency when using classical unsteady techniques as a transient regime must be bypassed. New techniques, dedicated to time-periodic flows and based on Fourier analysis, have been developed recently. Among these, harmonic balance methods cast a time-periodic flow computation in several coupled steady flow computations. A time-domain harmonic balance method is derived and adapted to phase lag periodic conditions to allow the simulation of only one blade passage per row regardless of row blade counts. Sophisticated space and time interpolations are involved and detailed. The test case is a single stage subsonic compressor. A convergence study of the present harmonic balance is performed and compared with a reference well-resolved classical unsteady flow simulation. The results show, on one hand, the good behavior of the harmonic balance and its ability to correctly predict global quantities as well as local flow pattern; on the other hand, the simulation time is drastically reduced. {\copyright} 2012 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.},

The vibration amplitudes of the blades in the last row of

to solve the resulting nonlinear equations of motion in the frequency

by the authors has been extended from a 2D contact model

to a full 3D contact model capable to represent the stick, the slip

and the separation contact condition. In [Sextro 2000], a model

for the vibration analysis of blades coupled by shrouds has been

presented including a contact model which is based on a spatial

to compute the modal properties and the coupling parameters

needed for the nonlinear vibration analysis. The main focus of

the nonlinear vibration analysis is on the determination of the

loss factor describing the overall nonlinear damping. The loss

@phdthesis{sill2004,
 abstract = {This thesis presents two novel nonlinear modal analysis methods,

aimed at the identification of representative engineering structures.

The overall objective is to detect, localize, identify and quantify the

nonlinearities in large systems, based on nonlinear frequency response

functions (FRFs) as input data. The methods are first introduced

in a direct-path, by analyzing a general theoretical system. Then,

the concepts are extended to tackle a nonlinear identification via the

reverse-path of the same methodologies.



The nonlinear formulation of this work is based in first-order describing

functions, which represent the nonlinearities by amplitudedependent

coefficients. This formulation is the basic ``engine'' of the

methods and techniques developed here. For the sake of clarity, the

research has been restricted to deal with cubic stiffness and friction

damping nonlinearities, although the inclusion of other types should

be straightforward, given the generality of the developments.



The first direct-path method, the so-called ``explicit formulation'' (EF),

is conducted entirely in the physical domain. This technique manipulates

the physical coefficients stored in the system matrices, thus the

term ``explicit'', yielding the nonlinear FRF at a selected DOF as a

closed-form expression, regardless of the system's size. An optimized

version of this method has been validated against real measurements

taken from a test rig, and it was found that the nonlinear behaviour

was predicted with reasonable accuracy.



A reverse path of the ``explicit formulation'', REF, was implemented

as a nonlinear identification tool. In spite of successful results, it was

concluded that the computational cost of this approach was too high

to gain acceptance in a practical analysis. Still, the method provides

a much needed bridge between a full-size theoretical model and the

relatively small number of experimental measurements that may be

available.



The second main method, operating in a direct-path, is called the

``hybrid modal technique'' (HMT). It is based on a novel nonlinear

modal expansion, which is analogous to existing nonlinear modal superposition

techniques. The underlying linear system is expressed in

generalized modal coordinates, while the nonlinearities are kept in the

physical domain. The use of hybrid coordinates is a central feature,

by which the localization of the nonlinearities is fully addressed.



A reverse-path of this method, R-HMT, incorporates the successive

application of several ``standalone'' techniques, also developed here,

which can be used independently to tackle different aspects of nonlinear

modal analysis. When gathered together, the individual techniques

provide a robust methodology, able to perform a nonlinear

identification within the usual experimental restrictions, while exhibiting

high computational efficiency.



The type of the nonlinearity can be identified by a newly introduced

technique, based in the geometrical ``footprint'' of the extracted nonlinear

component. The localization of the nonlinearities is then achieved

by a linear least-squares calculation over a predefined nonlinear region

of arbitrary size. This technique provides an unambiguous localization,

provided that the analyzed frequency range is a fair representation

of the system.



Although the nonlinear natural frequencies and modal damping are

not explicitly needed for identifying the system or regenerating the

responses at some other forcing level, a fast approximation technique

(FAT) is introduced, allowing the analytical derivation of these parameters

via newly-developed expressions. The FAT establishes links with

other nonlinear methods and standard linear modal analysis techniques.},

 abstract = {The problem of the cancellation of mass-loading effects of transducers in experimental structural dynamic analysis is addressed. A generalized solution based upon dynamic coupling and uncoupling of substructures is presented. It is shown that it is possible to solve the problem, no matter where the extra loading masses are located, by means of a series of relatively straightforward calculations. It is also shown that one can obtain frequency response functions (FRFs) without having to undertake the corresponding measurements. Up to now, the problem of obtaining the dynamic properties of all the structure FRF curves has only been considered possible provided the complete FRF matrix has been measured. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to solving this problem. In fact, the technique developed for cancellation of mass-loading effects is shown to also allow for the evaluation of the complete FRF matrix. A simple numerical example is presented to illustrate the good theoretical performance of the method. The same example is extended to incorporate noise, simulating an experimental situation, and it is shown that the technique is highly sensitive to measurement inaccuracies and that further work is necessary in order to solve this difficulty. A possible solution to improve the results is presented and discussed.},

 abstract = {Diagnosing the root cause of compressor blade failures by high cycle fatigue (HCF) is elusive for gas turbines with a long history of successful operation; long operating times preclude design, fabrication, and material defect issues that are usually associated with short term failures. Long exposure time might implicate erosion or corrosion issues for compressor failures. An investigation of 3rd stage stator vane and 4 th stage rotor blade failure in a Frame 7 gas turbine revealed that aerodynamic excitations associated with mild compressor instability (undetected by installed sensors) was the most probable cause. A Blade Vibration Audit (BVA) approach exploits information collected and compared from independent sources: 1) Fracture mode details and expected failure stress levels estimated in metallurgical examination; 2) Aerodynamic excitations due to internal airfoil wakes, rotating stall, and flutter applied to vibratory stress response data obtained by modal testing to estimate relative operating stress levels; 3) Design margins deduced from successful operating experience, which establish a base line for comparison with the excitation sources considered likely. Diagnosis of HCF failure causes must produce results that match observations of the specific failures in three ways: 1 ) The airfoils must be in resonance for sufficient time for fatigue to occur, 2) The vibratory stress must be greater at the failure location than elsewhere, and 3) The causal effect must significantly increase the stress at the failure location to be more than elsewhere. The analysis showed that the 3rd stator vane failed at 2/3 span, which led to 4th blade failure due to subsequent adverse aerodynamic excitation and impact damage. The most likely cause of the 3 rd stator vane failure was a combination of resonant excitation from excessive wakes of the downstream rotor blades and flutter associated with mild intermittent surge.

 abstract = {An initial study into the application of the Hilbert transform in modal analysis procedures is presented. It is shown that typical structural non-linearities such as non-linear damping and stiffness can be detected and identified directly without the need to generate explicit models. No assumptions regarding the degree of non-linearity are made, which is a restriction in the classical methods for dealing with non-linearities. The properties of the Hilbert transform are discussed with respect to linear and non-linear dynamical systems, and a discrete transform, developed from the continuous functions, is derived in the frequency domain and adapted to modal analysis data in the form of mobility transfer functions. Truncation effects arising from limited frequency ranges of the mobility transfer functions are accounted for by employing correction terms in the frequency domain. Several examples are studied of single and multi-mode systems with non-linearities such as friction, clearance and non-linear stiffness. These examples indicate that the Hilbert transform offers a new method for extending modal analysis to the domains of non-linear systems.},

The approach is based on the idea that the state vector and the periodic matrix of the system can be expanded in terms of Chebyshev polynomials over the principal period. Such an expansion reduces the original problem to a set of linear algebraic equations from which the solution in the interval of one period can be obtained. Furthermore, the technique is combined with Floquet theory to yield the transition matrix at the end of one period and provide the stability conditions via an eigen-analysis procedure. Two formulations are presented. The first formulation is suitable for a set of equations written in state space form, while the second can be applied directly to a set of second order equations. The application is demonstrated through practical illustrative examples including the parametric excitation problem of a fixed-fixed column. The numerical results thus obtained are compared with those obtained from DVERK, a Runge-Kutta code available in the IMSL library. An error-bound analysis is also included. It is concluded that the suggested schemes not only provide accurate results but are also computationally very efficient. In particular, the second formulation is found to be several times faster than the standard Runge-Kutta type codes.},

However, as S increases beyond a certain value, the steady-state response ceases to be simply harmonic and, while still periodic, is a more complex waveform. The transition slip load is found to be lower for smaller gamma. The maximum possible reduction in vibratory stresses increases as gamma decreases.

Indeed, the impact of unstable oscillations can be catastrophic. It can cause vehicle control problems and component degradation. Accordingly, complex stability analysis is required. This paper outlines stability analysis and centre manifold approach for studying instability problems. To put it more precisely, one considers brake vibrations and more specifically heavy trucks judder where the dynamic characteristics of the whole front axle assembly is concerned, even if the source of judder is located in the brake system. The modelling introduces the sprag-slip mechanism based on dynamic coupling due to buttressing. The non-linearity is expressed as a polynomial with quadratic and cubic terms. This model does not require the use of brake negative coefficient, in order to predict the instability phenomena. Finally, the centre manifold approach is used to obtain equations for the limit cycle amplitudes. The centre manifold theory allows the reduction of the number of equations of the original system in order to obtain a simplified system, without loosing the dynamics of the original system as well as the contributions of non-linear terms. The goal is the study of the stability analysis and the validation of the centre manifold approach for a complex non-linear model by comparing results obtained by solving the full system and by using the centre manifold approach. The brake friction coefficient is used as an unfolding parameter of the fundamental Hopf bifurcation point.},

In this paper, we propose to complete this study by examining the influence of structural damping on limit cycle amplitudes in order to achieve a complete design including not only the evolution of stable/unstable areas but also the evolution of limit cycle amplitudes as functions of the structural damping and nonlinear system parameter. For the sake of simplicity, a two-degree-of-freedom minimal model is constructed and analysed to examine the effects of structural damping and cubic nonlinearity on the limit cycles. The nonlinear behaviour and stable limit cycle amplitudes are determined through a Complex Nonlinear Modal Analysis which makes use of the nonlinear unstable mode governing the nonlinear dynamics of structural systems in unstable areas. Based on this nonlinear modal approach, we will produce and explain qualitative and quantitative results of limit cycle evolutions in the presence of structural damping and nonlinearity. {\copyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The harmonic balance method, in combination with a path-following continuation procedure, is used to calculate the periodic response of a non-linear model of a cracked rotor system. The stability of the rotor's periodic movements is studied in the frequency domain by introducing the effects of a perturbation on the periodic solution for the cracked rotor system. It is shown that the areas of instability increase considerably when the crack deepens, and that the crack's position and depth are the main factors affecting not only the non-linear behaviour of the rotor system but also the different zones of dynamic instability in the periodic solution for the cracked rotor. The effects of some other system parameters (including the disk position and the stiffness of the supports) on the dynamic stability of the non-linear periodic response of the cracked rotor system are also investigated.},

This procedure is based on the detection of the super-harmonic frequency components of the non-linear dynamical behaviour at the associated sub-critical resonant peaks. The non-linear behaviour of the rotor system with a breathing crack is briefly analysed numerically: it will be illustrated that the effects of the crack size and location induce the variation of non-linear responses and the emerging of new resonance - antiresonance peaks of the cracked rotor at second, third and fourth harmonic frequency components. Then, the influence of the crack-unbalance interactions and more particularly the relative orientation between the front crack and the unbalance are also undertaken with considerations of various crack depths, and unbalance magnitudes. It is demonstrated that for a given crack depth, the unbalance does not only affect the vibration amplitude of the 1X amplitudes, but also the 1/2 and 1/3 sub-critical resonant peaks. Finally, it is illustrated that the emerging of super-harmonic frequency components provides useful information on the presence of cracks and may be used on an on-line crack monitoring rotor system. Using this methodology, the detection of small levels of damage may be easily undertaken.},

The finite element rotor system is composed of a shaft with one disk, two flexible bearing supports and a ball bearing element where the non-linearities are due to both the radial clearance and the Herztian contact between races and rolling elements. A numerical analysis is performed to analyze the non-linear behavior of this bearing rotor by using the Harmonic Balance Method with appropriate condensation located only on the non-linear coordinates of the system in order to minimize computer time. The condensation process reduces the original non-linear rotor system by focusing only on the solution of the non-linear equations of the Fourier coefficients associated with the system's non-linear components. In this study, the procedure is developed for the estimation of the harmonic and super-harmonic responses of the complex rotor system. Consequently, the non-linear unbalance responses and the associated orbits of the bearing rotor will be investigated. Moreover, the transition from contact to no-contact states between rolling elements and races, and the associated restoring contact forces are calculated for different speeds of the unbalanced rotor. Finally, hardening-type non-linearity or softening-type non-linearity due to the effects of radial clearance and unbalance mass are examined.},

 abstract = {This paper outlines the non-linear transient and stationary dynamics due to friction-induced vibrations in a disc brake model. Using a finite element model and the Continuous Wavelet Transform, the contributions of fundamental frequencies and harmonic components in non-linear transient and stationary dynamics are investigated for disc brake system subjected to single and multi-instabilities. Results from these non-linear analyses demonstrate the complexity of the contributions of different harmonic components in transient friction-induced vibrations with the coexistence of multi-unstable modes. One of the most important contributions of this study is to illustrate the limitation of stability analysis related to transient and stationary non-linear behaviors. Stability analysis around an equilibrium point can only be used as the first step in providing information on the onset and increase of self-excited disc brake vibrations. Consequently, a complete non-linear analysis is necessary to fully predict non-linear vibration and the contribution of unstable modes. This study shows that an under-estimation of the unstable modes observed in the non-linear time simulation can be calculated by the stability analysis. During transient vibrations, an additional unstable mode can appear. This instability is not predicted by the complex eigenvalues analysis due to the fact that linear conditions (i.e. the linearized stability around an initial equilibrium point) are not valid during transient and stationary oscillations. So new fundamental frequencies (linked to the appearance of the new unstable mode) can emerge in the signals due to the non-linear contact and loss of contact interactions at the frictional interface. Therefore, non-linear transient and stationary self-excited vibrations can become very complex and include more unstable modes than those predicted by a linearized stability analysis around a non-linear equilibrium point. {\copyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Like all second-order ordinary differential equations, it has a corresponding first-order partial differential equation, whose independent solutions constitute the constants of the motion. These constants readily provide an approximate solution correct to first order in the damping constant.

 abstract = {The optical power of satellites such as the Hubble telescope is directly related to the size of the

primary mirror. However, due to the limited capacity of the shuttle bay, progress towards the

development of more powerful satellites using traditional construction methods has come to a

standstill. Therefore, to allow larger satellites to be launched into space significant interest has

been shown in the development of ultra large inflatable structures that can be packaged inside the

shuttle bay and then deployed once in space. To facilitate the packaging of the inflated device in

its launch configuration, most structures utilize a thin film membrane as the optical or antenna

surface. Once the inflated structure is deployed in space, it is subject to vibrations induced

mechanically by guidance systems and space debris as well as thermally induced vibrations from

variable amounts of direct sunlight. For the optimal performance of the satellite, it is crucial that

the vibration of the membrane be quickly suppressed. However, due to the extremely flexible

nature of the membrane structure, few actuation methods exist that avoid local deformation and

surface aberrations.



One potential method of applying damping to the membrane structure is to use magnetic

damping. Magnetic dampers function through the eddy currents that are generated in a

conductive material that experiences a time varying magnetic field. However, following the

generation of these currents, the internal resistance of the conductor causes them to dissipate into

heat. Because a portion of the moving conductor's kinetic energy is used to generate the eddy

currents, which are then dissipated, a damping effect occurs. This damping force can be

described as a viscous force due to the dependence on the velocity of the conductor.



While eddy currents form an effective method of applying damping, they have normally been

used for magnetic braking applications. Furthermore, the dampers that have been designed for

vibration suppression have typically been ineffective at suppressing structural vibration,

incompatible with practical systems, and cumbersome to the structure resulting in significant

mass loading and changes to the dynamic response. To alleviate these issues, three previously

unrealized damping mechanisms that function through eddy currents have been developed,

modeled and tested. The dampers do not contact the structure, thus, allowing them to add

damping to the system without inducing the mass loading and added stiffness that are typically

common with other forms of damping. The first damping concept is completely passive and

functions solely due to the conductor's motion in a static magnetic field. The second damping

system is semi-active and improves the passive damper by allowing the magnet's position to be

actively controlled, thus, maximizing the magnet's velocity relative to the beam and enhancing

the damping force. The final system is completely active using an electromagnet, through which

the current can be actively modified to induce a time changing magnetic flux on the structure and

a damping effect.



The three innovative damping mechanisms that have resulted from this research apply control

forces to the structure without contacting it, which cannot be done by any other passive vibration

control system. Furthermore, the non-contact nature of these dampers makes them compatible

with the flexible membranes needed to advance the performance of optical satellites.},

a vibration damper, while undesirable are not major design criteria. However, in recent

years there has been a growing interest in the development of ultra large lightweight

deployable structures. Because these structures are deployable, they are packaged in their

launch configuration and deployed once in space. The packaging of the satellite leads to the

requirement that the metrology surface be flexible and has typically been a very thin

membrane. Because this membrane is to be used as a metrology surface it must hold

extremely strict surface tolerances which can easily be exceeded if the membrane is

subjected to structural vibrations. This requirement that for the membrane to perform

optimally it must be free of vibration, leads to difficult control issues brought on by the

membranes extremely flexible nature. This extreme flexibility places severe limitations on

the actuation methods compatible with the membrane. These limitations are due to the fact

that the bonding of an actuator to the membrane would result in surface aberrations and

that if a point actuation method were used only local deformations would result. The eddy

In the present study, a new electromagnetic damping mechanism is introduced. This mechanism is different from previously developed electromagnetic braking systems and eddy current dampers because the system investigated in the subsequent manuscript uses the radial magnetic flux to generate the electromagnetic damping force rather than the flux perpendicular to the magnet's face as done in other studies. One important advantage of the proposed mechanism is that it is simple and easy to apply. Additionally, a single magnet can be used to damp the transverse vibrations that are present in many structures. Furthermore, it does not require any electronic devices or external power supplies, therefore functioning as a non-contacting passive damper. A theoretical model of the system is derived using electromagnetic theory enabling us to estimate the electromagnetic damping force induced on the structure. The proposed eddy current damper was constructed and experiments were performed to verify the precision of the theoretical model. It is found that the proposed eddy current damping mechanism could increase the damping ratio by up to 150 times and provide sufficient damping force to quickly suppress the beam's vibration.},

 abstract = {When a conductive material experiences a time-varying magnetic field, eddy currents are generated in the conductor. These eddy currents circulate such that they generate a magnetic field of their own, however the field generated is of opposite polarity, causing a repulsive force. The time-varying magnetic field needed to produce such currents can be induced either by movement of the conductor in the field or by changing the strength or position of the source of the magnetic field. In the case of a dynamic system the conductor is moving relative to the magnetic source, thus generating eddy currents that will dissipate into heat due to the resistivity of the conductor. This process of the generation and dissipation of eddy current causes the system to function as a viscous damper. In a previous study, the concept and theoretical model was developed for one eddy current damping system that was shown to be effective in the suppression of transverse beam vibrations. The mathematical model developed to predict the amount of damping induced on the structure was shown to be accurate when the magnet was far from the beam but was less accurate for the case that the gap between the magnet and beam was small. In the present study, an improved theoretical model of the previously developed system will be formulated using the image method, thus allowing the eddy current density to be more accurately computed. In addition to the development of an improved model, an improved concept of the eddy current damper configuration is developed, modeled, and tested. The new damper configuration adds significantly more damping to the structure than the previously implemented design and has the capability to critically damp the beam's first bending mode. The eddy current damper is a noncontacting system, thus allowing it to be easily applied and able to add significant damping to the structure without changing dynamic response. Furthermore, the previous model and the improved model will be applied to the new damper design and the enhanced accuracy of this new theoretical model will be proven.},

However, following the generation of these currents, the internal resistance of the conductor causes them to dissipate into heat. Because a portion of the moving conductor's kinetic energy is used to generate the eddy currents, which are then dissipated, a damping effect occurs. This damping force can be described as a viscous force due to the dependence on the velocity of the conductor. In a previous study, a permanent magnet was fixed in a location such that the poling axis was perpendicular to the beam's motion and the radial magnetic flux was used to passively suppress the beam's vibration. Using this passive damping concept and the idea that the damping force is directly related to the velocity of the conductor, a new passive-active damping mechanism will be created. This new damper will function by allowing the position of the magnet to change relative to the beam and thus allow the net velocity between the two to be maximized and thus the damping force significantly increased. Using this concept, a model of both the passive and active portion of the system will be developed, allowing the beams response to be simulated. To verify the accuracy of this model, experiments will be performed that demonstrate both the accuracy of the model and the effectiveness of this passive-active control system for use in suppressing the transverse vibration of a structure.},

 abstract = {When a conductive material is subjected to a time-changing magnetic field, eddy currents are formed in the conductor. These currents circulate inside the conductor such that a magnetic field is formed. This eddy current field then interacts with the applied field resulting in a dynamic force between the conductor and the magnetic source. The force can be considered dynamic because as the eddy currents circulate inside the conductor they are dissipated by the internal resistance of the conductor. Therefore, if a continuously changing field is not applied to the conductor the force will disappear. However, the eddy current forces can be utilized to form an actuator by applying a time-changing current to an electromagnet that is in close proximity to a conductive material. This actuation method is easy to incorporate into the system and allows significant forces to be applied without every coming into contact with the structure. In this manuscript, the authors develop the concept and show that it can be accurately modeled and effectively used to control the vibration of a structure. The active eddy current actuator has not been previously demonstrated and therefore this article will present the first use of the system for providing transverse vibration suppression. Furthermore, the constraints necessary to design an active control filter will be presented. This vibration control system will use a velocity feedback filter to actively modify the current applied to the coil. Using this system, experiments are performed on a cantilever beam showing the system can effectively suppress each of the first five modes of vibration by upwards of 20 dB, demonstrating the actuator has an increased bandwidth over previously used eddy current methods.},

This means that: (1) the uncertain local parameters occurring in the global mass, damping and stiffness matrices of the finite element model have to be identified; (2) appropriate probabilistic models of these uncertain parameters have to be constructed; and (3) functions mapping the domains of uncertain parameters into the global mass, damping and stiffness matrices have to be constructed. In the low-frequency range, a reduced matrix model can then be constructed using the generalized coordinates associated with the structural modes corresponding to the lowest eigenfrequencies. In this paper we propose an approach for constructing a random uncertainties model of the generalized mass, damping and stiffness matrices. This nonparametric model does not require identifying the uncertain local parameters and consequently, obviates construction of functions that map the domains of uncertain local parameters into the generalized mass, damping and stiffness matrices. This nonparametric model of random uncertainties is based on direct construction of a probabilistic model of the generalized mass, damping and stiffness matrices, which uses only the available information constituted of the mean value of the generalized mass, damping and stiffness matrices. This paper describes the explicit construction of the theory of such a nonparametric model.},

Nonlinear normal modes offer a solid theoretical framework for interpreting a wide class of nonlinear dynamic phenomena. However, their computation for large-scale models can be time consuming, particularly when nonlinearities are distributed across the degrees of freedom. In this paper, the nonlinear normal modes of systems featuring distributed geometric nonlinearities are computed from reduced-order models comprising linear normal modes and modal derivatives. Modal derivatives stem from the differentiation of the eigenvalue problem associated with the underlying linearised vibrations and can therefore account for some of the distortions introduced by nonlinearity. The cases of the Roorda's frame model, a doubly-clamped beam, and a shallow arch discretised with planar beam finite elements are investigated. A comparison between the nonlinear normal modes computed from the full and reduced-order models highlights the capability of the reduction method to capture the essential nonlinear phenomena, including low-order modal interactions.},

 abstract = {Mechanical joints often affect structural response, causing localized non-linear stiffness and damping changes. As many structures are assemblies, incorporating the effects of joints is necessary to produce predictive finite element models. In this paper, we present an adjusted Iwan beam element (AIBE) for dynamic response analysis of beam structures containing joints. The adjusted Iwan model consists of a combination of springs and frictional sliders that exhibits non-linear behavior due to the stick--slip characteristic of the latter. The beam element developed is two-dimensional and consists of two adjusted Iwan models and maintains the usual complement of degrees of freedom: transverse displacement and rotation at each of the two nodes. The resulting element includes six parameters, which must be determined. To circumvent the difficulty arising from the non-linear nature of the inverse problem, a multi-layer feed-forward neural network (MLFF) is employed to extract joint parameters from measured structural acceleration responses. A parameter identification procedure is implemented on a beam structure with a bolted joint. In this procedure, acceleration responses at one location on the beam structure due to one known impulsive forcing function are simulated for sets of combinations of varying joint parameters. A MLFF is developed and trained using the patterns of envelope data corresponding to these acceleration histories. The joint parameters are identified through the trained MLFF applied to the measured acceleration response. Then, using the identified joint parameters, acceleration responses of the jointed beam due to a different impulsive forcing function are predicted. The validity of the identified joint parameters is assessed by comparing simulated acceleration responses with experimental measurements. The capability of the AIBE to capture the effects of bolted joints on the dynamic responses of beam structures, and the efficacy of the MLFF parameter identification procedure, are demonstrated.},

Numerical examples demonstrate that the general joint interface element is capable of accounting for both friction and impact damping in jointed interfaces, as well as capturing the transfer of vibrational energy from low frequency to high during impact. The development of an interface slip zone is a combined result of the actual friction traction and pressure distribution along the interfaces.

 abstract = {Mechanical joints, such as the bolted shear lap joint considered here, are ubiquitous in engineered structures, which realize vibration damping as well as load transfer from them. However, the prediction of the energy-dissipation characteristics of such joints remains a challenging problem. A cubic relationship between energy dissipated and load magnitude is often assumed in classical joint dynamics, but experiments generally fail to support this assertion. In nearly all of the joint models examined previously, Coulomb friction and uniform pressure in the joint were assumed. Realizing that the Coulomb model may not adequately represent the actual dynamic friction in the slip region of the joint interface and that the actual interfacial pressure is likely nonuniformly distributed, we utilize a distributed-parameter joint model to investigate the constitutive relation and energy dissipation associated with a shear lap joint under longitudinal loading. Two nonuniform pressure distributions in a one-dimensional structure are considered. In both, under the Coulomb friction law, the energy dissipation resulting from microslip can be expressed as a power series starting from the third order of the magnitude of loading. It is shown that the exact cubic relation is valid only for the uniform pressure distribution. The distributed-parameter joint model presented herein can be represented by a parallel-series Iwan model. The distribution function of critical slip force in the Iwan model can be obtained analytically from the constitutive relation associated with the joint model; results are given for the cases of the normal traction specified as a power function of the spatial coordinate, and as a Gaussian function.},

reduced-order modeling technique employs component mode

synthesis, with each stage (bladed disk) treated as a separate

component. In addition, the component mode mistuning (CMM)

projection technique was extended to multistage systems. In the

a basis of cantilevered blade modes to the basis of tuned system

modes used for the reduced-order model. In this paper, the

component-based modeling framework developed for mistuned

First, the identification of multistage mode types is considered.

Strain energy ratios are used to identify which system

modes are confined to mostly one stage and which modes show

strong coupling among multiple stages. Simple approximations

for these ratios are derived based on data from the componentlevel

free response analysis that are performed during the model

construction process. The component-level results are also utilized

to identify the dominant nodal diameter number for each

cyclic symmetry because the stages have different numbers

of blades. Second, the modes are further classified as to how

much the blades participate in the response relative to the disk

for each stage. As a systematic identification procedure, this is

applicable to single-stage models as well. For multistage systems,

this is used to determine operating conditions where coupled

response among blades on adjacent stages is most likely

to occur. Third, the application of mistuning identification techniques

to multistage systems is considered. It is found that the

proposed modal classification methods allow the determination

of conditions under which deviations in individual blade properties

 abstract = {When subjected to cyclic loading, complete contacts with {\`a} la Coulomb friction may sometimes develop a favourable situation where slips cease after a few cycles, an occurrence commonly known as frictional shakedown. However, if the amplitude of the cyclic load is greater than a so-called shakedown limit, the system is unable to adapt and indefinitely persists in a dissipative state. In this paper, we present a comprehensive theoretical and numerical analysis of the shakedown in three-dimensional elastic systems with conforming frictional interfaces. In a discrete framework, the limit states of the frictional system are investigated through two distinct approaches: incremental analysis based on a novel Gauss--Seidel algorithm, which allowed us to explore the whole transient response under a given cyclic loading scenario, and a linear optimisation algorithm to directly determine the stick and shakedown limits. Illustrative examples, ranging from a single-node model to multi-node systems with both coupled and uncoupled contacts, are discussed.},

 abstract = {The vortex lock-in effect has been well-studied for an oscillating cylinder and numerous experimental and computational data are available. However, only recently has this phenomenon been observed for two-dimensional isolated airfoils as well as turbine cascades. This paper investigates a flow instability about a two-dimensional airfoil tip section of a modern front stage compressor blade operated at an off-design condition. The governing nonlinear, unsteady Navier-Stokes equations are solved using a novel harmonic balance (HB) method. For periodic unsteady flows, such as the transonic flow through a turbomachinery cascade, this method requires one to two orders of magnitude less computational time than conventional time-accurate solvers. The vortex shedding frequency is obtained using a unique phase error method. Enforced motion is then used to encourage lock-on of the frequency of the blades' motion to the natural shedding frequency. In particular, it is assumed that the airfoils vibrate harmonically in pitch about their elastic axis at a given frequency and amplitude. Analogous to the circular cylinder, a V-shaped lock-in region is observed. The aeroelastic stability of the rotor is determined and the results indicate that the largest limit cycle oscillation (LCO) amplitude is not at the natural shedding frequency. Furthermore, the system is always stable at the natural shedding frequency. This is contrary to conventional thought in which the most significant response is assumed to be when the blade frequency and the frequency of the fluid instability are coincident. Therefore, the results indicate how both the natural shedding frequency and blade frequency should be considered in design analysis.

These coarse spaces are specifically designed for the two-level methods to be scalable and robust with respect to the coefficients in the equation and the choice of the decomposition. We achieve this by solving generalized eigenvalue problems on the interfaces between subdomains to identify the modes that slow down convergence. Theoretical bounds for the condition numbers of the preconditioned operators, which depend only on a chosen threshold, and the maximal number of neighbors of a subdomain are presented and proved. For the finite element tearing and interconnecting method, there are two versions of the two-level method: one based on the full Dirichlet preconditioner and the other on the, cheaper, lumped preconditioner. Some numerical tests confirm these results. {\copyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

The approach presented provides a great deal of insight into the nature of the non-linear forced resonant response.

The most difficult parameter that influences its accurate calculation pertains to an appropriate definition of the laws of friction that relate the rubbing motion with the forces induced. This paper develops an analysis that leads to a mathematical relationship between the forces of friction damping at a vibrating interface and the corresponding relative motion. The analysis permits calculation of forces at the interface if the displacements are known or vice. The equations are cast in terms of relative motion between mating shrouds so that degenerate cases of fully locked and freely slipping can be calculated. Examples are given showing simulation results obtained using discrete structural models. Extension of the analysis to the case of a full assembly is discussed.},

 abstract = {Many engineered structures are assembled using different kinds of joints such as bolted, riveted and clamped joints. Even if joints are often a small part of the overall structure, they can have a massive impact on its dynamics due to the introduction of nonlinearities. Thus, joints are considered a design liability. Significant effort has been spent in joint characterization and modelling, but a predictive joint model is still non-existent. To overcome these uncertainties and ensure certain safety standards, joints are usually overdesigned according to static considerations and their stiffness. Especially damping and nonlinearity are not considered during the design process. This can lead to lower performance, lower payload, and as result of the joints structural dynamic models often do a poor job of predicting the dynamic response. However, it is well-known that, particularly for metal structures, joints represent the main source of energy dissipation. In this work a minimal model is used to show how structural performance can be improved using joints as a design variable. Common optimization tools are applied to a nonlinear joint model in order to damp undesired structural vibrations. Results illustrate how the intentional choice of joint parameters and locations can effectively reduce vibration level for a given operating point of a jointed structure.},

 abstract = {Despite significant advances in modeling of friction-induced vibrations and brake squeal, the majority of industrial research and design is still conducted experimentally, since many aspects of squeal and its mechanisms involved remain unknown. In practice, measurement data is available in large amounts. We report here for the first time on novel strategies for handling data-intensive vibration testings to gain better insights into friction brake system vibrations and noise generation mechanisms. Machine learning-based methods to detect and characterize vibrations, to understand sensitivities and to predict brake squeal are applied with the aim to illustrate how interdisciplinary approaches can leverage the potential of data science techniques for classical mechanical engineering challenges. In the first part, a deep learning brake squeal detector is developed to identify several classes of typical friction noise recordings. The detection method is rooted in recent computer vision techniques for object detection based on convolutional neural networks (CNN). It allows to overcome limitations of classical approaches that solely rely on instantaneous spectral properties of the recorded noise. Results indicate superior detection and characterization quality when compared to a state-of-the-art brake squeal detector. In the second part, a recurrent neural network (RNN) is employed to learn the parametric patterns that determine the dynamic stability of an operating brake system. Given a set of multivariate loading conditions, the RNN learns to predict the noise generation of the structure. The validated RNN represents a virtual twin model for the squeal behavior of a specific brake system. It is found that this model can predict the occurrence and the onset of brake squeal with high accuracy and that it can identify the complicated patterns and temporal dependencies in the loading conditions that drive the dynamical structure into regimes of instability. Large data sets from commercial brake system testing are used to train and validate the models. This work is a contribution to the MSSP Special Issue in Honor of Professor Lothar Gaul.},

 abstract = {In turbomachine industry, bladed assembly vibration measurements

are very important for blades behaviour estimation.

These measurements are generally obtained from strain gauges.

However, one of the most promising methods for the analysis of

blade vibrations in rotating bladed assemblies is the Blade Tip

Timing or Optical Blade Vibration Measurement method.

A set of optical sensors is mounted on an engine casing, in

front of a disc, and measures the times of arrival of each blade.

These timings are then used to compute the vibrations of the

blades. However the fundamental problem for spectral analysis

of blade tip timing data is that the signals are undersampled

and aliased. We propose here a new method for spectral estimation

of blades responses from tip timing data that overcome these

difficulties.

The method proposed in this communication is based on the

use of a minimum variance filter associated with an iterative updating

of the autocorrelation matrix. That allows to process correctly

a signal even if the number of known signal samples is less

than equivalent Nyquist criterion. This approach is suitable for

spectral analysis of undersampled and aliased signals.

Perfomances of the spectral estimator have been evaluated

for one simulated and one experimental test cases. The method

seems very promising for the monitoring of mistuned bladed

discs.},

@article{Stewart.1995,
 abstract = {The patterns of bifurcation governing the escape of periodically forced oscillations from a potential well over a smooth potential barrier are studied by numerical simulation. Both the generic asymmetric single-well cubic potential and the symmetric twin-well potential Duffing oscillator are surveyed by varying three parameters: forcing frequency, forcing amplitude, and damping coefficient. The close relationship between optimal escape and nonlinear resonance within the well is confirmed over a wide range of damping. Subtle but significant differences are observed at higher damping ratios. The possibility of indeterminate outcomes of jumps to and from resonance near optimal escape is cmppletely suppressed above a critical level of the damping ratio (about 0.12 for the asymmetric single-well oscillator). Coincidentally, at almost the same level of damping, the optimal escape condition becomes distinct from the apex in the (\textgreek{w}, F) plane of the bistable regime; this corresponds to the appearance of chaotic attractors which subsume both resonant and non-resonant motions within one well. At higher damping levels, further changes occur involving conversions from chaotic-saddle to regular-saddle bifurcations. These changes in optimal escape phenomena correspond to codimension three bifurcations at exceptional points in the space of three parameters. These bifurcations are described in terms of homoclinic and heteroclinic structures of invariant manifolds, and changes in accessible boundary orbits. The same sequence of codimension three bifurcations is observed in both the twin-well Duffing oscillator and the asymmetric single-well escape equation. Within the codimension three bifurcation patterns governing escape, one particular codimension two global bifurcation involves a chaotic attractor explosion, or interior crisis, compounded with a blue sky catastrophe or boundary crisis of the exploded attractor. This codimension two bifurcation has structure containing a form of predictive power: knowledge of attractor bifurcations in part of the codimension two pattern permits inference of the attractor and basin bifurcations in the remainder. This predictive power is applicable beyond the context of escape from potential wells. Quantitative correlation of bifurcation patterns between the two equations according to simple scaling laws is tested. The unstable periodic orbits which figure most prominently in the major attractor-basin bifurcations are of periods one and three. Their linking is conveniently interpreted by a three-layer spiral horseshoe structure for the folding action in phase space within a well. The structure of this 3-shoe implies a partial ordering among order three subharmonic saddle-node bifurcations. This helps explain the sequence of codimension three bifurcations near optimal escape. Some bifurcational precedence relations are known to follow from the linking of periodic orbits in a braid on a 3-shoe. Additional bifurcational precedence relations follow from a quantitative property of generic potential wells: the dynamic hilltop saddle has a very large expanding multiplier over one cycle of forcing near fundamental resonance. This quantitative property explains the close coincidence of codimension three bifurcations near the suppression of indeterminate outcomes. An experimentalist's approach to identifying the three-layer template structure from time series data is discussed, including a consistency check involving Poincar{\'e} indices. The bifurcation patterns emerging at higher damling values create favorable conditions for realizing experimental strategies to recognize optimal escape and locate it in parameter space. Strategies based solely on observations of quasi-steady behavior while remaining always within one well are discussed.},

 abstract = {Knowledge about the fatigue behaviour of metallic materials in the range of very high cycle fatigue (VHCF, N {\&}gt; 107) is a key factor to improve the safety against failure of component parts. Even in the conventional field of application of nickel-base alloys (e.g. turbine blades) superimposed high frequency loading requires a safe life at very high number of cycles. Thus, the fatigue behaviour of structural materials in the very high cycle regime has become an important and active subject of research. In this paper, polycrystalline nickel-base alloys (Nimonic 80A and Nimonic 75) and pure Nickel (wavy slip character) were investigated in the VHCF regime by varying the precipitation conditions (peak-aged, overaged and precipitation-free), dislocation slip behaviour and test frequency. In addition, mechanisms of fatigue failure in the VHCF regime were compared to conventional damage evolution (in the LCF and HCF region) on the basis of load-controlled low frequency tests. Surprisingly the overaged condition of Nimonic 80A shows a slightly higher fatigue strength in the VHCF regime as compared to the peak-aged condition. The results obtained document that fatigue failure can still occur beyond 107 cycles. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out, in order to characterize the influence of microstructure, the resulting dislocation slip behaviour and the relevant dislocation particle interaction mechanism. Studies of the development of slip markings on surface grains were performed mainly using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). {\copyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The central issue of the article is the investigation of the fundamental concepts that are used to solve collision problems by using rigid-body theory. We particularly focus on low-velocity impacts of relatively rigid steel bars to test the applicability of these concepts. An experimental analysis was conducted to study the rebound velocities of freely dropped bars on a large external surface. A high-speed video system was used to capture the kinematic data. The number of contacts and the contact time were determined by using an electrical circuit and an oscilloscope. Tests were performed by using six bar lengths and varying the pre-impact inclinations and the velocities of the bars. The experimental results were used to verify the applicability of Coulomb's law of friction and the invariance of the coefficient of restitution in the class of impacts considered in this study. Then, given the unusual variation the coefficient of restitution as a result of changing pre-impact inclinations, a theoretical model was developed to explain this variation. A discrete model of the bar was used to obtain the equations of motion during impact. Computed and experimental results were compared to establish the accuracy of numerical model. The internal vibrations of the bar and multi impacts between the bar and the surface were found to be two main factors that cause the variation of the coefficient of restitution. Furthermore, a slenderness factor was proposed to identify the subset of collision problems where the coefficient of restitution was invariant to the inclination angle.},

This paper covers the investigation of a nonlinear jointed structure in the frequency domain. Due to frictional nonlinearities the behavior of that system is approximated using the Multiharmonic Balance Method (MHBM). Two models of different complexity are presented. The first is a simple three degree-of-freedom model which is valid because of the special design of the structure. This model enables a very fast and accurate prediction of the stationary behavior of the real system. In order to attain a more general way of modeling structures including joints, the second model is a Finite Element (FE) model. For the discretization of the contact plane, ``Zero Thickness'' (ZT) elements are implemented. These elements allow the application of nearly arbitrary constitutive laws for describing the dynamic joint behavior. Here a coupled three dimensional contact law including dry friction effects is applied and the needed partial derivatives for the MHBM procedure are given analytically. Using measurements from the real structure and performing a model updating process, the parameters of the two presented models are estimated. The calculation results are compared to measurements in the frequency as well as in the time domain.},

 abstract = {The non-linearity of a hardening-type oscillator provides a wider bandwidth and a higher energy harvesting capability under harmonic excitations. Also, both low- and high-energy responses can coexist for the same parameter combinations at relatively high excitation levels. However, if the oscillator?s response happens to coincide with the low-energy orbit then the improved performance achieved by the non-linear oscillator over that of its linear counterpart, could be impaired. This is therefore the main motivation for stabilisation of the high-energy orbit. In the present work, a schematic harvester design is considered consisting of a mass supported by two linear springs connected in series, each with a parallel damper, and a third-order non-linear spring. The equivalent linear stiffness and damping coefficients of the oscillator are derived through variation of the damper element. From this adjustment the variation of the equivalent stiffness generates a corresponding shift in the frequency?amplitude response curve, and this triggers a jump from the low-energy orbit to stabilise the high-energy orbit. This approach has been seen to require little additional energy supply for the adjustment and stabilisation, compared with that needed for direct stiffness tuning by mechanical means. Overall energy saving is of particular importance for energy harvesting applications. Subsequent results from simulation and experimentation confirm that the proposed method can be used to trigger a jump to the desirable state, thereby introducing a beneficial addition to the performance of the non-linear hardening-type energy harvester that improves overall efficiency and broadens the bandwidth.},

 abstract = {The harmonic balance method is a mixed time domain and frequency domain approach for efficiently solving periodic unsteady flows. The implementation described in this paper is designed to efficiently handle the multiple frequencies that arise within a multistage turbomachine due to differing blade counts in each blade row. We present two alternative algorithms that can be used to determine which unique set of frequencies to consider in each blade row. The first, an all blade row algorithm, retains the complete set of frequencies produced by a given blade row's interaction with all other blade rows. The second, a nearest neighbor algorithm, retains only the dominant frequencies in a given blade row that arise from direct interaction with the adjacent rows. A comparison of results from a multiple blade row simulation based on these two approaches is presented. We will demonstrate that unsteady blade row interactions are accurately captured with the reduced frequency set of the nearest neighbor algorithm, and at a lower computational cost compared to the all blade row algorithm. An unsteady simulation of a two-stage, cooled, high pressure turbine cascade is achieved using the present harmonic balance method and the nearest neighbor algorithm. The unsteady results obtained are compared to steady simulation results to demonstrate the value of performing an unsteady analysis. Considering an unsteady flow through a single blade row turbine blade passage, it is further shown that unsteady effects are important even if the objective is to obtain accurate time-averaged integrated values, such as efficiency.

 abstract = {A numerical methodology is described to study the influence of the contact location and contact condition of friction damper in aircraft engines. A simplified beam model is used to represent the blade for the preliminary design stage. The frictional damper is numerically analyzed based on two parameters, contact angle and vertical position of the platform. The nonlinear modal analysis is used to investigate the nonlinear dynamic behavior and damping performances of the system. The harmonic balanced method with the continuation technique is used to compute the nonlinear modes for a large range of energy levels. By using such a modeling strategy, the modal damping ratio, resonant amplitude, and resonant frequency are directly and efficiently computed for a range of design parameters. Monte Carlo simulations together with Latin hypercube sampling is then used to assess the robustness of the frictional damper, whose contact parameters involve much uncertainties due to manufacturing tolerance and also wear effects. The influences of those two parameters are obtained, and the best performances of the frictional damper can be achieved when the contact angle is around 25 deg--30 deg. The vertical position of the platform is highly mode dependent, and other design considerations need to be accounted. The results have proved that the uncertainties that involved contact surfaces do not have significant effects on the performance of frictional damper.},

 abstract = {The dynamic analysis of systems with nonlinearities has become an important topic in many engineering fields. Apart from the forced response analyses, nonlinear modal analysis has been successfully extended to such non-conservative systems thanks to the definition of damped nonlinear normal modes. The energy balance method is a tool that permits to directly predict resonances for a conservative system with nonlinearities from its nonlinear modes. In this work, the energy balance method is extended to systems with non-conservative nonlinearities using the concept of the damped nonlinear normal mode and its application in a full-scale engineering structure. This extended method consists of a balance between the energy loss from the internal damping, the energy transferred from the external excitation and the energy exchanged with the non-conservative nonlinear force. The method assumes that the solution of the forced response at resonance bears resemblance to that of the damped nonlinear normal mode. A simplistic model and full-scale structure with dissipative nonlinearities and a simplistic model showing self-excited vibration are tested using the method. In each test case, resonances are predicted efficiently and the computed force--amplitude curves show a great agreement with the forced responses. In addition, the self-excited solutions and isolas in forced responses can be effectively detected and identified. The accuracy and limitations of the method have been critically discussed in this work.},

Because of the non-conservative characteristics, the dNNMs are no longer periodic. To compute non-periodic dNNMs using classic methods for periodic problems, two concepts have been developed in the last two decades: complex nonlinear mode~(CNM) and extended periodic motion concept~(EPMC). A critical assessment of these two concepts applied to different types of non-conservative nonlinearities and industrial full-scale structures has not been thoroughly investigated yet. Furthermore, there exist two emerging techniques which aim at predicting the resonant solutions of a nonlinear forced response using the dNNMs: extended energy balance method~(E-EBM) and nonlinear modal synthesis~(NMS). A detailed assessment between these two techniques has been rarely attempted in the literature. Therefore, in this work, a comprehensive comparison between CNM and EPMC is provided through two illustrative systems and one engineering application. The EPMC with an alternative damping assumption is also derived and compared with the original EPMC and CNM. The advantages and limitations of the CNM and EPMC are critically discussed. In addition, the resonant solutions are predicted based on the dNNMs using both E-EBM and NMS. The accuracies of the predicted resonances are also discussed in detail.},

Nonlinear systems exhibit a variety of dynamic behavior that includes periodic, almost-periodic (quasi-periodic), and chaotic motions. This paper describes a computational algorithm based on the shooting method that calculates the periodic responses of a nonlinear system under periodic excitation. The current algorithm calculates also the stability of periodic solutions and locates system parameter ranges where aperiodic and chaotic responses bifurcate from the periodic response. Once the system response for a parameter is known, the solution for near range of the parameter is calculated efficiently using a pseudo-arc length continuation procedure. Practical procedures for continuation, numerical difficulties and some strategies for overcoming them are also given. The numerical scheme is used to study the imbalance response of a rigid rotor supported on squeeze-film dampers and journal bearings, which have nonlinear stiffness and damping characteristics. Rotor spinning speed is used as the bifurcation parameter, and speed ranges of sub-harmonic, quasi-periodic and chaotic motions are calculated for a set of system parameters of practical interest. The mechanisms of these bifurcations also are explained through Floquet theory, and bifurcation diagrams.},

First, the given large order system is reduced using a fixed-interface component mode synthesis procedure (CMS) in which the degrees of freedom associated with non-linear elements are retained in the physical co-ordinates while all others, whose number far exceeds the number of non-linear DOF, are transformed to modal co-ordinates and reduced using real mode CMS. A shooting and continuation method is then applied to the reduced system to solve for the periodic response. Floquet stability theory is used to calculate stability and bifurcations of the periodic response. The algorithm is applied to study the response to imbalance, stability, and bifurcations of a 24 DOF flexible rotor supported on journal bearings. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm, though approximate, can yield very accurate information about dynamic behavior of large order non-linear systems, even with few numbers of retained component modes.

The approach is motivated by examining the response of a bilinear spring-mass system to excitation at two frequencies, such that the difference between the two frequencies is the resonant frequency of the system. The numerically generated steady state response of the system clearly betrays the presence of the bilinear spring, even if the difference between the compressive and tensile stiffness is very small. The same idea is applied to a cracked beam forced at two frequencies, with the crack providing a local bilinear stiffness in the beam. The numerically generated steady state response shows the effect of the opening and closing of the crack. The prominence of this non-linear effect is then correlated with crack position and depth. It is shown that the non-linear effect is maximized if a static load is also placed on the beam that would cause the crack to be on the verge of opening, thus determining the opening load.},

This, however, reduces the available margin for oscillations within the suspension. If the oscillation amplitude exceeds a critical value, the suspension will impact a bumpstop. Under periodic excitation, the onset of low-velocity impacts is associated with a strong instability in favor of high-velocity impacts. Such impacts reduce comfort and could be damaging to the vehicle. Efforts should therefore be made to limit impact velocities with the bumpstop, for example by suppressing the instability associated with low-velocity impacts. This paper proposes a low-cost feedback-control strategy, based on making small adjustments to the position of the bumpstop, that serve to suppress the transition to high-velocity impacts with the bumpstop in the case of periodic excitation. The control law is derived from the theory of discontinuity maps. The results demonstrate that the feedback strategy works even when wheel-hop is present.},

practice for the elimination of high cycle fatigue failures of

turbomachinery blading. Damper performance curves and

damper optimization curves are used for the design of friction

dampers. It is establishedAAfrom the previous work that apart

from damper mass, the contact stiffness between damper and

the blade platform is an important parameter in achieving a

good damper design. Several methods for the estimation of

damper stiffness have been proposed in the literature. Some of

them include: 1. Curve fitting approach to a measured

frequency response function, 2. Compliance measurement,

3. Measurement of hysteresis loop etc. However, it is not

possible to carry out extensive sets of experiments to observe

the influence of various parameters on the contact stiffness.

Numerical and/or analytical models for contact stiffness

evaluation are the present needs for a damper designer. This

paper addresses a detailed investigation of the contact stiffness

computation. Finite element modeling of the damper and the

platform is carried out to study the effect of various

parameters such as friction coefficient, centrifugal load,

material properties etc. on the contact stiffness. The role of

surface roughness and wear are neglected in the present

analysis. The reliability of the applied finite element meshes is

verified by simulating Hertz's contact problems. The

parametric study indicates that the contact stiffness builds up

with increase in friction coefficient, centrifugal force and

elastic modulus of the damper material. The results received

from a pilot experiment are also presented for further

evaluation of the computed results. Finally, a very good

agreement between the numerical and experimental

performance curves (resonance response amplitude of the

blade versus excitation amplitude for the constant damper

mass; Cameron et. al, 1987) of the blade with the damper is

found for the tangential contact stiffness obtained from the

@misc{szwe2007a,
 abstract = {For industrial condensing steam turbines operating at

variable speed, Siemens has developed a last stage SKblade

family in the early 80s. The principle goal was to

design a robust blade profile for the highest reliability and a

good performance, which allow the operation in resonances

under high steam mass flow and excessive condensing

pressures. To suppress resonance stresses through friction

dissipation, loosely fitted conical bolts are applied to the

upper part of adjacent airfoils. In the early 80s, these

capabilities were experimentally investigated and validated

for the smallest SK-blade at a set-up of the real turbine unit.

The tapered and twisted geometry of the smallest SK-blade

has been scaled under consideration of the similar

mechanical and aerodynamic characteristics. The entire

scaled-up SK-blade family has proved its reliability in more

than 500 industrial turbine units arranged for different

power and speeds. In the last years there could be seen a

trend to very large compression units, like GTL (Gas to

Liquids), PTA (Acid Terephtalic) or Methanol plants.

Therefore, the SK-blade family has been extended to larger

airfoils using the well established scale concept based on

the smallest SK-unit.

In this paper, the mechanical capabilities of the

smallest and large SK-blades coupled by the bolts are

verified by using the Finite Element (FE) Method. The

static analyses with friction sliding on the bolts and the

linear dynamic behaviour of tuned disc assemblies are

considered. The FE mesh quality and the proper restraint

conditions at the radial root are accomplished by getting

good agreements between the computed and measured

resonance frequencies of the large freestanding blade at

standstill. The validated mesh refinement and root

boundary conditions are used further in all numerical FE

analyses. For the large SK-disc assembly under spin pit

conditions, the obtained FE results are in very good

agreement with the experimental Campbell diagram. The

determined positions of the gauges allow for identifying

either stick-slip or sticking contact conditions at the bolts.

The experimental spin pit results show mainly sticking

contact conditions at the bolts because of too weak air jet

excitation. Only in very narrow frequency ranges around

resonance peaks, micro-slips on the friction bolts occur due

to the resonance amplification of blade vibrations. This is

proved indirectly by the evaluated damping values for spin

pit conditions, which are bigger than the damping

magnitudes of the disc assembly at standstill, which was

measured with hammer tests. This empirical statement is

approved by the FE steady-state dynamic results for the

analytically determined amplitudes of the air jet excitation.

The obtained results show that the proposed linear dynamic

concept can be successfully applied to the design process of

the scaled turbine discs of different dimensions with loosely

assembled friction bolts for assessment of maximum static

stresses and free vibration behaviour. The scaling design

criteria of the blades with friction bolts are confirmed fully

for natural frequencies and excitation conditions, but their

real responses depending on the excitation amplitudes need

to be obtained from the non-linear dynamic simulation

which is considered in paper GT2007-27506 (Szwedowicz

et al., 2007).},

 abstract = {An entire family of twisted and tapered low pressure

steam turbine SK-blades with pinned radial root and loosely

assembled conical bolts is designed by scaling of the

aerodynamic and mechanical properties of the smallest

airfoil. For SK-blades operating with variable speed, the

friction bolts, mounted in the upper airfoil part, provide

either damping or coupling capabilities for the blades with

respect to resonance conditions. The damping and coupling

performance have been proved experimentally in the test

rig of the real turbine. The measurements of the smallest

SK-disc assembly under different operating conditions have

allowed understanding the dynamic and damping behaviour

of the bolts that are either friction dampers or coupling

devices for the vibrating blades depending on the excitation

level. In this paper, non-linear dynamic analyses of the

smallest and large SK-turbine stage are performed and

compared with the experimental data. The modal blade

dynamics is defined by 30 complex FE mode shapes of the

freestanding blades coupled by the disc whereby the bolt's

motion is described by 6 rigid body modes. The sticking

contact condition between the blades and bolts is

represented by the normal and tangential contact stiffness.

These values are firstly estimated analytically with the

Hertz's formulas for the FE reaction forces and contact

areas. More realistic contact stiffness values are obtained

from the iterative process, in which the resonance

frequencies are calculated with the steady-state simulations

and compared to the FE nodal diameter curves for sticking

contact conditions that meet the experimental frequencies

very well (GT2007-27502). In non-linear simulations, in

case of exceeding the sticking contact condition, the

induced friction forces are linearized by the Harmonic

Balance Method. In this manner, the micro-slipping and

sticking contact behaviour at all contact points are

calculated iteratively for the specified excitation

amplitudes, friction coefficient, contact roughness and aerodamping

values that are known from the experiment. The

computed results of the tuned smallest SK-blades agree

with the experimental resonance stresses of 12 measured

blades. Differences between the computed and measured

stresses are caused by mistuning, which was not quantified

in the experiment. The non-linear dynamic analyses provide

evidence of good damping performance for the smallest and

large SK-blades with respect to wide range of excitation

forces, different friction coefficients and various aerodynamic

damping values. For the analyzed resonances of

the 8th engine order, the scalability of damping

performance is found for the SK-blades of different sizes.},

 abstract = {Underplatform friction dampers are possible solutions for minimizing vibrations of rotating turbine blades. Solid dampers, characterized by their compact dimensions, are frequently used in real applications and often appear in patents in different forms. A different type of the friction damper is a thin-walled structure, which has larger dimensions and smaller contact stresses on a wider contact area in relation to the solid damper. The damping performance of a thin-walled damper, mounted under the platforms of two rotating, freestanding high pressure turbine blades, is investigated numerically and experimentally in this paper. The tangential and normal contact stiffness that are crucial parameters in optimal design of any friction damper are determined from three-dimensional finite element computations of the contact behavior of the damper on the platform including friction and centrifugal effects. The computed contact stiffness values are applied to nonlinear dynamic simulations of the analyzed blades coupled by the friction damper of a specified mass. These numerical analyses are performed in the modal frequency domain, which is based on the harmonic balance method for the complex linearization of friction forces. The numerical dynamic results are in good agreement with the measured data of the real mistuned system. In the analyzed excitation range, the numerical performance curve of the thin-walled damper is obtained within the scatter band of the experimental results. For the known friction coefficients and available finite element and harmonic balance tools, the described numerical process confirms its usability in the design process of turbine blades with underplatform dampers.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a novel test rig to study the effect of fretting wear and of the contact surface evolution on the forced response of systems with dry friction contact. This rig allows simulating contacts similar to the type of contacts present between the shrouds at the blade tip. Several research groups have been studying how fretting wear affects the dynamic response of mechanical systems, developing numerical prediction tools that consider dry friction contact and nonlinearity. The aim of this work is to experimentally study the evolution of contact interfaces and how this evolution affects the system dynamics. Experimental results will aid to validate the numerical predictions. The test rig developed for this activity is made of a cantilever beam fixed at one end and with a friction contact at the free end. The contact couple is made of two replaceable specimens. The contact is loaded via a lifting mechanism through a screw with fine thread. Fretting wear test was performed at a constant frequency and force amplitude, exciting the beam with an electromagnetic shaker. To emphasize the change of the dynamic response, frequency sweeps were performed at various intervals during the wear test. The full range test with `changing preload' due to progressing wear was performed until a full loss of contact. This paper describes the test rig design, intent, set-up, instrumentation, test plan and results. Results include the frequency response curves for unworn contact, wear profiles at multiple intervals and the effect of wear on the frequency response. Though energy dissipation per cycle is quite small, wear leads to material loss at the contact with a sufficiently large number of cumulative cycles and substantially affects the dynamic response. Results collected in this research activity are of particular importance to validate numerical tool that aim to simulate the dynamic behaviour of systems with dry friction contacts that undergo material loss caused by wear.},

Currently, most vibration-based energy harvesters are designed as linear resonators to achieve optimal performance by matching their resonance frequencies with the ambient excitation frequencies a priori. However, a slight shift of the excitation frequency will cause a dramatic reduction in performance. Unfortunately, in the vast majority of practical cases, the ambient vibrations are frequency-varying or totally random with energy distributed over a wide frequency spectrum. Hence, developing techniques to increase the bandwidth of vibration-based energy harvesters has become the next important problem in energy harvesting.

In this study, the energy expressions that construct the new constitutive law is integrated into minimum potential energy formulation to develop a new finite element for fatigue life prediction. The comparison of Finite element method (FEM) results to existing experimental fatigue data, verifies the new finite element method for fatigue life prediction. The final output of this finite element analysis is in the form of number of cycles to failure for each element in ascending or descending order. Therefore, the new finite element framework can provide the number of cycles to failure for each element in gas turbine engine structural components.

A feedback controller is proposed to control the excitation amplitudes during step-sine tests in the vicinity of resonance frequencies to measure the frequency response curves used to perform such analysis. Additionally, a single-degree-of-freedom Duffing--Van der Pol oscillator is proposed to evaluate, through its calibrated parameters, the impact of several tightening torque conditions and multiple excitation amplitudes on the structural stiffness and damping considering the vibration mode that promotes pronounced deformation around the lap-joint. Due to the presence of contact patches, the results show that the structure maintained impressive repeatability after several experimental measurements. Besides, it is possible to increase the damping for amplitude attenuation without significant losses in the contact stiffness.},

The governing equations are derived using Hamilton's principle for a beam undergoing transverse bending, inplane bending, torsion and axial deformations. The effect of moderate deflections are included by retaining non-linear terms. The equations are then solved using finite element discretization in the spatial and time domain. Results are obtained for the cases with only actuation loads, with actuation loads and added periodic tip loads, and for a pretwisted beam. Numerical results show that the centrifugal stiffening effect reduces the tip transverse bending deflection and elastic twist obtained from smart actuation as the rotation speed increases. However, the effect of rotation speed on the tip elastic twist is less pronounced. The importance of non-linear terms for accurate prediction of torsion, in-plane bending and transverse bending response is also shown. It is also found that combinations of pretwist and smart actuation can be used to obtain desirable torsion response over a range of rotation speeds.},

It relies on the targeted energy transfer into the absorber within a narrow and fixed frequency band. Nonlinear energy sinks (NES) have a similar working principle. They are effective in a much wider frequency band but generally only in a limited range of excitation levels. To design NES, their working principle must be thoroughly understood. We consider a particular type of NES, a small mass undergoing impacts and dry friction within a cavity of a base structure (vibro-impact NES or impact absorber). The nonlinear dynamic regimes under near-resonant forcing and resulting operating ranges are first revisited. We then investigate how off-resonant vibration modes and dissipation via impacts and dry friction contribute to the vibration suppression. Moreover, we assess the effectiveness of the impact absorber for suppressing multiple resonances in comparison to a linear tuned vibration absorber (LTVA) and a pure friction damper with the same mass.},

Associated with every natural frequency (except for those for which the deflection is the same at corresponding points on every substructure) there are a pair of orthogonal mode shapes, with eigenvectors {u} and {ü}. The complex vector {z}={u}+i{ü} is also an eigenvector of the equations of motion, and represents a rotating normal mode. The deflection of one substructure has the same amplitude as, and a constant phase difference from the deflection of the preceding substructure. It is therefore possible to analysse the complete structure by considering only one substructure, and applying appropriate complex constraints at its boundary with the following substructure, so as to and applying appropriate complex constrainsts at its boundary with the following substructure, so as to impose this phase difference. The method has been implemented in a computer program and is illustrated by analyses of an alternator end winding, a cooling tower with legs, and a wheel of turbine blades.

For forced vibration, it is shown that any arbitrary oscillatory force can be decomposed into a series of rotating forces. For any one of these rotating components, there is a fixed relationship between the amplitude and phase of the force acting on one substructure, and that acting on an adjoining substructure. This relationship, which does not involve any approximation, can be used to enable a series of calculations of the response of one substructure to be performed instead of one on the whole structure. A series of calculations on an individual substructure normally requires much less computer time and storage than a single calculation on the complete structure.},

Earlier studies have demonstrated the effect of freely sliding mass: vibrations of a structure may decrease when forces of non-linear interaction cause a mass to slide along it. However, when the mass stops sliding at an equilibrium point, a new resonance frequency is created that cannot be damped by further sliding. This study suggests adding passive restoring forces for returning the mass to a prescribed position at small levels of vibration. The effect of this is considered numerically and analytically for a simple study case: a spring-loaded point mass sliding on a tensioned string. The arrangement is shown to damp resonant vibrations, although the damped response may, under certain conditions, be beating or chaotic. Frequency responses are derived analytically for a number of cases, including slow frequency-sweeps across resonance. The suggested device is shown to limit vibrations due to parametric resonance. Sliding mass tends to be most effective in damping high amplitudes, thus complementing other passive or active control strategies that are typically most effective at low amplitudes.},

 abstract = {In turbomachinery, it is well known that tighter operating clearances improve the efficiency. However, this leads to unwanted potential unilateral and frictional contact occurrences between the rotating (blades) and stationary components (casings) together with attendant thermal excitations. Unilateral contact induces discontinuities in the velocity at impact times, hence the terminology nonsmooth dynamics. Current modeling strategies of rotor--stator interactions are either based on regularizing penalty methods or on explicit time-marching methods derived from Carpenter's forward Lagrange multiplier method. Regularization introduces an artificial time scale in the formulation corresponding to numerical stiffness, which is not desirable. Carpenter's scheme has been successfully applied to turbomachinery industrial models in the sole mechanical framework, but faces serious stability issues when dealing with the additional heat equation. This work overcomes the above issues by using the Moreau--Jean nonsmooth integration scheme within an implicit \textgreek{j}-method. This numerical scheme is based on a mathematically sound description of the contact dynamics by means of measure differential inclusions and enjoys attractive features. The procedure is unconditionally stable opening doors to quick preliminary simulations with time-steps one hundred times larger than with previous algorithms. It can also deal with strongly coupled thermomechanical problems.},

The modified Hamilton's principle uses displacement, velocity and momentum as variables, which allows their independent spatial discretization. Along with a local static condensation for velocity and momentum, it leads to an approach with a hybrid-mixed consistent mass matrix. An attractive feature of such a formulation is the possibility to construct hybrid singular mass matrices with zero components at those nodes where contact is collocated. This improves numerical stability of the semi-discrete problem: the differential index of the underlying differential-algebraic system is reduced from 3 to 1, and spurious oscillations in the contact pressure, which are commonly reported for formulations with Lagrange multipliers, are significantly reduced. Results of numerical experiments for truss and Timoshenko beam elements are discussed. In addition, the properties of the novel discretization scheme for an unconstrained dynamic problem are assessed by a dispersion analysis.Copyright {\copyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

These are examined by experimentally determining the magnetic field strength properties of a typical exciter and the results show these to be a non-linear even function. This information is used with the equations of motion of the excited which are simulated on an analog computer. The computed force characteristics are shown to compare very closely with experimental results. The amount of second harmonic force distortion generated at a system resonance is analyzed by considering a simple single degree-of-freedom model. It is shown that the amount of force distortion is related to the damping of the system under test and the ratio of the exciter stiffness to the system stiffness. It is also shown that the force input to a system near a system resonance can vary considerably, even though the input current to the exciter is constant. These effects are shown to be due to the forces arising from the mass and stiffness characteristics of the exciter being used. Experimental tests on a simple system confirm the theoretical predictions.},

Complex eigenvalue analysis and transient non-linear simulations highlight how system parameters, like structural damping, affect the macroscopic frictional behaviour, switching from stick-slip phenomena to harmonic vibrations (due to mode coupling instability), up to the stable sliding state.

 abstract = {In order to build efficient reduced-order models (ROMs) for geometrically nonlinear vibrations of thin structures, a normal form procedure is computed for a general class of nonlinear oscillators with quadratic and cubic nonlinearities. The linear perturbation brought by considering a modal viscous damping term is especially addressed in the formulation. A special attention is focused on how all the linear modal damping terms are gathered together in order to define a precise decay of energy onto the invariant manifolds, also defined as nonlinear normal modes (NNMs). Then, this time-independent formulation is used to reduce the dynamics governing the oscillations of a structure excited by an external harmonic force. The validity of the proposed ROMs is systematically discussed and compared with other available methods. In particular, it is shown that large values of the modal damping of the slave modes may change the type of nonlinearity (hardening/softening behaviour) of the directly excited (master) mode. Two examples are used to illustrate the main features of the method. A two-degrees-of-freedom (dof) system allows presentation of the main results through a simple example. Then a water-filled circular cylindrical shell with external resonant forcing is considered, in order to show the ability of the method to substantially reduce the dynamics of a continuous structure.},

 abstract = {The transition from periodic to chaotic vibrations in free-edge, perfect and imperfect circular plates, is numerically studied. A pointwise harmonic forcing with constant frequency and increasing amplitude is applied to observe the bifurcation scenario. The von K{\'a}rm{\'a}n equations for thin plates, including geometric non-linearity, are used to model the large-amplitude vibrations. A Galerkin approach based on the eigenmodes of the perfect plate allows discretizing the model. The resulting ordinary-differential equations are numerically integrated. Bifurcation diagrams of Poincar{\'e} maps, Lyapunov exponents and Fourier spectra analysis reveal the transitions and the energy exchange between modes. The transition to chaotic vibration is studied in the frequency range of the first eigenfrequencies. The complete bifurcation diagram and the critical forces needed to attain the chaotic regime are especially addressed. For perfect plates, it is found that a direct transition from periodic to chaotic vibrations is at hand. For imperfect plates displaying specific internal resonance relationships, the energy is first exchanged between resonant modes before the chaotic regime. Finally, the nature of the chaotic regime, where a high-dimensional chaos is numerically found, is questioned within the framework of wave turbulence. These numerical findings confirm a number of experimental observations made on shells, where the generic route to chaos displays a quasiperiodic regime before the chaotic state, where the modes, sharing internal resonance relationship with the excitation frequency, appear in the response.},

Although the use of piezo accelerometers as response transducers is very popular for impact testing due to its easy and fast implementation, the level of accuracy could not be adequate in certain applications. The laser technology provides a non-invasive alternative to standard piezo devices. The choice of a non-contact measurement technique allows to minimize the impact of external dynamic systems on the test component during the measurement process. In this paper, a validation of Lagrange Multiplier---Frequency Based Substructuring coupling by means of a Virtual Point Reduction is performed on a benchmark structure with a non-stiff interface. The necessary FRF data is acquired twice, using accelerometers and a laser Doppler vibrometer respectively. Both coupling results are compared to each other and are shown to match very well simulation data up to a high frequency range. The results underline the potential of high quality, non-intrusive measurements for Frequency Based Substructuring.},

 abstract = {Two methods of fluid-structure coupling for turbomachinery are presented, the first one in the frequency domain and the second in both frequency and time domains. In both methods, the structure and the fluid are assumed to have circumferential cyclic symmetric properties and the unsteady aerodynamic forces are assumed to be linear in terms of the structural displacements. The motion equation of the reference sector in the travelling wave coordinates is projected on the complex eigenmodes for each phase number. The generalized unsteady aerodynamic forces are computed by solving the Euler equations and by assuming the structural motion to be harmonic with a constant phase angle between two adjacent sectors. In the frequency domain, the complex, nonlinear eigenvalue problem for the aeroelastic stability analysis is solved iteratively either by the double scanning method or by using Karpel's minimum state smoothing of the aerodynamic coefficient matrix. In the time domain, Karpel's smoothing method is used to obtain an approximation of the generalized unsteady aerodynamic forces by means of auxiliary state variables. These coupling methods are tested on a compressor blade row and the good agreement obtained between their results and those of the direct coupling method shows that the proposed numerical methods, already used in aircraft applications, are adapted to turbomachinery. {\copyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The model is based on the framework of nonsmooth dynamics and convex analysis that allows us to easily and systematically incorporate unilateral contact forces (i.e., between the snake robot and the ground surface) and friction forces based on Coulomb's law of dry friction. Conventional numerical solvers cannot be employed directly due to set-valued force laws and possible instantaneous velocity changes. Therefore, we show how to implement the model for numerical treatment with a numerical integrator called the time-stepping method. This method helps to avoid explicit changes between equations during simulation even though the system is hybrid. Simulation results for the serpentine motion pattern lateral undulation and sidewinding are presented. In addition, experiments are performed with the snake robot ldquoAikordquo for locomotion by lateral undulation and sidewinding, both with isotropic friction.

Beanspruchung dar, die ber{\"u}cksichtigt werden mu{\ss}.



An einer dreistufigen Niederdruck-Modelldampfturbine wurden umfangreiche Untersuchungen

im Betriebsbereich der extremen Teillast durchgef{\"u}hrt, wobei neben der Ermittlung der thermischen

Belastung im Bereich der letzten drei Stufen die Bestimmung der dynamischen Schaufelbelastung

die Laufschaufel mitgerissen.



Im Bereich der extremen Teillast wurde, neben einer moderaten Zunahme der Wechseldehnungsbelastung

durch eine stochastische Anregung aller Schwingungs-Eigenformen der Endstufenlaufschaufel,

in einem schmalbandigen Bereich des Volumenstromes eine dominante Anregung

Today's market requirements for steam generators calls for a strong increase in the range and

severity of operation conditions. As a result of this, steam turbines, or specific rows within the

steam turbines are required to operate more frequently under conditions with little or no steam

flow. This extreme part load condition, known as windage, results in an increases in the thermal

and dynamic load on the blading, which must be considered in the design.



Extensive investigations on extreme part load conditions were carried out using a model of a

three stage low pressure steam turbine. The primary goals were to determine the resulting thermal

conditions in the last three stages and to evaluate the dynamic vibration in the last rotating

blade row. The investigations showed with closed steam valve temperature up to 300°C between

the preliminary stage (L-1) and the last stage (L-0). A comparison of results from a single stage

model and the three stage model showed that the windage losses are similar. At volumetric flow

below 23{\%} of the rated condition, the power absorption rate was almost constant at the last running

blade row. This was the case for both test configurations.



Pneumatic flow field measurements in the last stage showed a strong increase in circumferential

flow for a corresponding decrease in volumetric flow up stream from the last rotating row (the

fluid is carried along by the rotating blade). This flow phenomena starts at the tip section of the

blade and propagates down the blade with further decrease in flow.



At part load condition, in addition to the moderate increase of the alternating stress through the

stochastic excitation of all natural frequencies of the last running blade in a small range of the

volumetric flow, a dominate excitation appeared at the second and third natural frequencies. For

the third vibration mode only, a moderate increase in amplitudes occurred, in contrast an enhancement

up to the sixth of the normal low level was measured for the second mode. The dynamic

stress in the blades, were below the vibration fatigue strength limit under all excitation

conditions.



Measurements of flow field fluctuations in front of and behind the last running blade indicates

strong unsteady flow close to the outer flow boundary between 11{\%} up to 22{\%} of the design

volumetric flow. It is a matter of rotating pressure cells generated in the relative system. The

geometric area as well as the operation range are obviously connected with the strong increase of

the circumferential velocity component as aforementioned. The decreasing circumferential velocity

difference between fluid and rotating blade at declining volumetric flow leads in the relativeand

absolute system to a strong change of frequency for the pressure fluctuation. Additionally the

occurrence of higher modes of the fluctuation frequency increases the bandwidth of the excitation

frequencies. Thereby this flow phenomena can be a endangerment of the running blade of

last stages, arouse by high blade vibration through forced aerodynamic induced excitation.},

The dynamic analysis of two different structures in one of which there are 10 groups of 6 blades and in the other 5 groups of 12 blades, is performed to investigate behavior deviation. In this research, the following jobs are considered: (1) collect the geometric dimensions and material properties of a single blade, (2) create the finite element model of a single blade, a group of 6 blades and 12 blades, and full cycle of 60 blades, (3) perform the vibration analyses of a single blade, a group of blades and a full circle of 60 blades, (4) perform the steady state stress analysis of the blade with different rotating speed; (5) get the Campbell diagram for the full circle of blades, and (6) make comparisons between a group of 6 blades and a group of 12 blades.

The conclusions from the analyses are the following: (1) the contact elements are applied to groups of 6 and 12 blades systems and the highest stresses are observed at the location of the first neck of the blade root. These results completely agree very well with in-site observations. (2) The big differences were present in the Campbell diagram: resonant frequencies are observed in the first vibration group for the full system comprising the group of 6 blades and resonant frequencies are not found in the first vibration group of the full blade system made of the group of 12 blades. (3) The dynamic behavior of the full blade system comprised of a group of 6 blades was found much different from that of the full blade system made is of a group of 12 blades.

 abstract = {For an efficient and accurate analysis of impact problems reduced flexible multibody systems can be used. Therefore, a precise reproduction of the wave propagation in the colliding bodies as well as contact forces and stresses are required. To capture all mentioned phenomena precisely, a set of eigenmodes and static shape functions has to be used for the elastic description of the flexible bodies. While the eigenmodes represent the global deformations, and therefore are physically important, the static shape functions are only necessary to capture the local deformations. Hence, their very high eigenfrequencies are artificially generated and additionally increase the numerical stiffness of the system. As a result of that, the numerical efficiency may decrease. In the present paper, two approaches for an efficient contact simulation in reduced flexible multibody simulations using static shape functions are presented. Both approaches are based on the subdivision of the elastic parts of the equations of motion in low and high frequency parts. The first approach uses modal damping on the high frequency parts. The second approach treats the high frequency parts quasi-statically and so they can be neglected in the dynamic simulation. The focus is on numerical stiff systems with a large number of static shape functions simultaneously loaded. Comparisons are made between reduced flexible multibody systems using the proposed approaches and full non-linear finite element simulations.},

@phdthesis{tuch2003,
 abstract = {Disc brake squeal is an irritating high-pitched sound which still remains a major problem

facing the automotive industry. The main concern over the squeal problem is that

it can cause discomfort to passengers and pedestrians and, hence, reduce the overall

acceptability of the vehicle. The overall aim of this project is to gain some new and

better insight into the problem of disc brake squeal.

In this thesis, general squeal characteristics are studied via the use of a pin-ondisc

system which is used as a representative model to include the essential features

of the actual brake assembly. By assuming that the friction coefficient is constant, a

linear pin-on-disc model can be derived. The onset of instability of the linear pin-ondisc

system can be obtained via a complex eigenvalue analysis. A possible mechanism

in which instability is generated is also discussed. The linear pin-on-disc model is

extended into a more realistic model by incorporating a new friction model in which

the friction coefficient is a continuous function of the relative velocity between the two

contact surfaces. The responses of this new pin-on-disc model are calculated using a

time-integration method. A particular interest has been concentrated on the limitcycle

characteristics of the system, especially when mistuning has been added to the

disc. To make certain that the theoretical models can represent the dynamic behaviour

of the real structure, the simulated results are verified against test data.

Apart from the squeal modelling, the current research also investigate free vibration

characteristics of three-dimensional ``tophat-like'' structures widely used in disc brake

design. A systematic method for unambiguous mode identification of these structures

has been developed. Furthermore, the current study also demonstrates a systematic

method for classifying vibration modes of ``tophat-like'' structures into appropriate

families according to their similarity both in the r $-$ 

and r $-$ z planes.},

Interaction of this NES with the flow is mediated by the cylinder, whose rectilinear motion is mechanically linked to rotational motion of the NES mass through nonlinear inertial coupling. The rotational NES provides significant `passive' suppression of VIV. Beyond suppression however, the rotational NES gives rise to a range of qualitatively new behaviours not found in transverse VIV of a sprung cylinder without an NES, or one with a `rectilinear NES', considered previously. Specifically, the NES can either stabilize or destabilize the steady, symmetric, motionless-cylinder solution and can induce conditions under which suppression of VIV (and concomitant reduction in lift and drag) is accompanied by a greatly elongated region of attached vorticity in the wake, as well as conditions in which the cylinder motion and flow are temporally chaotic at relatively low

Power Turbine blades, being normally uncooled, are

generally not affected by high temperature gradients; therefore

LCF (Low Cycle Fatigue) doesn't constitute their main limiting

life factor.

If creep is often not a limiting factor for aircraft engines

Most previous studies have considered quasi-static dynamics leading to escape. In devising efficient escape strategies for structures, transient conditions have not yet received adequate consideration. In this study, the intra-well nonlinear resonant dynamics of bi-stable systems are studied and exploited, yielding a time-efficient strategy for triggering minimal amplitude escape by employing transient perturbations. The response characteristics of both, the symmetric and asymmetric double-well Duffing oscillators are explored analytically to identify the stable solution branches for any given forcing configuration. Based on the basins of attraction of the stable attractors, a novel actuation methodology employing controlled perturbations in the phase of the forcing for driving the system into a series of high-amplitude limit cycle oscillations and eventual escape to the desired stable solution is proposed. Additionally, accelerated settling to the desired configuration is achieved by implementing state feedback techniques. The proposed algorithm serves as a potential tool for implementing fast shape adaptation in bi-stable structural systems.},

The major difference to previous approaches consists in the implementation of a contact algorithm allowing variable normal forces in the contact domain.

Nonlinear frequency response curves are obtained through an arc-length continuation procedure and confronted to the corresponding time integration simulations. An in-depth comparative analysis is conducted on the time signals obtained through both frequency domain strategies: (1) linear complementarity problem (LCP-HBM) and (2) dynamic lagrangian frequency time (DLFT-HBM). The unilateral contact conditions are thoroughly investigated in the time domain and compared with the reference time integration simulations. Particular attention is paid to the relation between both methods and it is shown that the DLFT-HBM is asymptotically equivalent to the LCP-HBM. This study also shows that the oversampling of time signals inside alternating frequency-time procedures generates non-physical high harmonics. Finally, a convergence analysis is conducted in order to assess the influence of the different numerical parameters on the respect of the unilateral contact laws.},

It is also possible to rank various blade designs since the proposed criterion is sensitive to changes in both unsteady aerodynamic loads and the vibration modeshapes. The proposed methodology was applied to a typical core-compressor forced response case for which measured data were available. The Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations were used to represent the flow in a non-linear time-accurate fashion on unstructured meshes of mixed elements. The structural model was based on a standard finite element representation from which the vibration modes were extracted. The blade flexibility was included in the model by coupling the finite element model to the unsteady flow model in a time-accurate fashion. A series of numerical experiments were conducted by altering the stator wake and using the proposed indicator functions to minimize the rotor response levels. It was shown that a fourfold response reduction was possible for a certain mode with only a minor modification of the blade.},

The first one is of aeroacoustic origin, and it arises from a match between the acoustic impedance of the intake duct and the upstream pressure perturbation due to fan vibration. The second type is directly related to flow separation effects and shock properties. Further objectives are to describe several numerical prediction methods, to compare their relative computational requirements, and to establish their bounds of applicability to various flutter types. The unsteady flow is either a linearization about a viscous nonlinear steady-state flow for a given mode of vibration, or it is fully nonlinear. The prediction methods are classified according to the way they treat the unsteady flow. In all cases, the fluid mesh was moved during the unsteady flow computations to follow the structural motion. The performance of the methods was ranked for a rig fan blade for which measurements were available. It was found that, near the stall boundary, flutter boundary could only be captured with an adequate representation of the unsteady viscous effects. It was concluded that the shock had a stabilizing effect whereas the separation area behind it had a destabilizing effect.},

 abstract = {This paper describes stall flutter, which can occur at part speed operating conditions near the stall boundary. Although it is called stall flutter, this phenomenon does not require the stalling of the fan blade in the sense that it can occur when the slope of the pressure rise characteristic is still negative. This type of flutter occurs with low nodal diameter forward traveling waves and it occurs for the first flap (1F) mode of blade vibration. For this paper, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code has been applied to a real fan of contemporary design; the code has been found to be reliable in predicting mean flow and aeroelastic behavior. When the mass flow is reduced, the flow becomes unstable, resulting in flutter or in stall (the stall perhaps leading to surge). When the relative tip speed into the fan rotor is close to sonic, it is found (by measurement and by computation) that the instability for the fan blade considered in this work results in flutter. The CFD has been used like an experimental technique, varying parameters to understand what controls the instability behavior. It is found that the flutter for this fan requires a separated region on the suction surface. It is also found that the acoustic pressure field associated with the blade vibration must be cut-on upstream of the rotor and cut-off downstream of the rotor if flutter instability is to occur. The difference in cut off conditions upstream and downstream is largely produced by the mean swirl velocity introduced by the fan rotor in imparting work and pressure rise to the air. The conditions for instability therefore require a three-dimensional geometric description and blades with finite mean loading. The third parameter that governs the flutter stability of the blade is the ratio of the twisting motion to the plunging motion of the 1F mode shape, which determines the ratio of leading edge (LE) displacement to the trailing edge (TE) displacement. It will be shown that as this ratio increases the onset of flutter moves to a lower mass flow. Copyright {\copyright} 2016 by ASME.},

The structure of propagation and attenuation zones (PZs and AZs) of the finite system depends on two non-dimensional parameters, v and \textgreek{t}. The parameter v is the ratio of the times of wave propagation at phase velocity through each layer, whereas parameter \textgreek{t} denotes the ratio of mechanical impedances of the materials forming the two layers. Systems with finite values of v and large or small values of \textgreek{t} are weakly coupled and possess narrow PZs and wide AZs. Depending on the value of v, a distinction is made between {\textquotedbl}degenerate{\textquotedbl} and {\textquotedbl}non-degenerate{\textquotedbl} PZs. The {\textquotedbl}degenerate{\textquotedbl} PZs are wider than {\textquotedbl}non-degenerate{\textquotedbl} ones. For small or large values of \textgreek{t}, the finite periodic system includes dense {\textquotedbl}clusters{\textquotedbl} of natural frequencies; when forced by a trapezoidal pulse, the maximum compressional force of the first arrival of the stress wave is localized close to the point of application of the excitation. For values of \textgreek{t} of order unity, this localization is eliminated. The effect on the free and forced response of disorder is then investigated. For a sufficiently strong disorder, a natural frequency shifts from a PZ to an AZ of the ordered system. This results in a spatial localization of the corresponding eigenfunction at the disorder. Finally, the transient responses of disordered and ordered systems are computed and compared. {\copyright} 1994 Academic Press. All rights reserved.},

The extension has been done in such a way that all advantages of the formalism with respect to the coordinates of large motion of rigid bodies are extended to the flexible degrees of freedom, e.g. the same recursive treatment of both coordinates and no appearance of O(n  3) computational complexity terms due to the flexibility. This extension has been derived for both open loop and closed loop systems of flexible bodies. The comparison of the computational complexity of this formalism with other known approaches has shown that the described formalism of composite rigid body and the residual algorithm based on it are more efficient formalisms for small number of bodies in the chains and deformation modes than the usual recursive formalism of articulated body inertia.},

This is the basis for nonlinear wave diagnostics of damage, methods which are remarkably sensitive to the detection and progression of damage in materials. Nonlinear wave modulation spectroscopy (NWMS) is one exemplary method in this class of dynamic nondestructive evaluation techniques. The method focuses on the application of harmonics and sum and difference frequency to discern damage in materials. It consists of exciting a sample with continuous waves of two separate frequencies simultaneously, and inspecting the harmonics of the two waves, and their sum and difference frequencies (sidebands). Undamaged materials are essentially linear in their response to the two waves, while the same material, when damaged, becomes highly nonlinear, manifested by harmonics and sideband generation. We illustrate the method by experiments on uncracked and cracked Plexiglas and sandstone samples, and by applying it to intact and damaged engine components.},

In the numerical analysis a continuous model for the elastic stop is used based on the contact force law of Hertz. The beam is modelled using finite elements and subsequently reduced using a component mode synthesis leading to a non-linear six-degree-of-freedom model. The steady state behaviour of this model is investigated by calculating periodic solutions while varying the excitation frequency. This is done by solving two-point boundary value problems using the multiple shooting method in combination with a path-following method. Experimental research concerning periodic solutions is carried out to verify the numerical results. The experimental results correspond very well with the numerical results. It appears that the high eigenfrequencies of the linear beam system strongly influence the low-frequency non-liner steady state response. This means that multi-degree-of-freedom models are important for an accurate representation of the actual system behaviour, although a single-degree-of-freedom model captures important first-order information about a lot of the non-linear phenomena in the low-frequency range.},

In this paper, a strongly non-linear beam-impact system under both broad- and small-banded, Gaussian noise excitations is investigated. The response of this system is investigated both numerically, through a multi-degree-of-freedom model, and experimentally focusing on frequency-domain phenomena such as stochastic equivalents of harmonic and subharmonic solutions. An improved understanding of these stochastic response characteristics is obtained by comparing these to non-linear periodic response features of the system. It will be shown that in modelling such a continuous, linear system with a local non-linearity, the linear part can be effectively reduced to a description based on several modes. Combining this reduced, linear part with the local non-linearity in a reduced, non-linear model is shown to result in a non-linear model, which can be used to accurately predict the stochastic response characteristics of the original, continuous, non-linear system. It is shown that including more modes to the model causes its response to differ significantly from that of a single-degree-of-freedom model and show a better correspondence with experimental results, also in the frequency range of the first mode.},

This damping ability when applied in structural elements can lead to a better noise control, improved life time and even better performance of the envisaged tools. By passive damping, it is understood that the material converts a significant part of unwanted mechanical energy into heat. This mechanical energy can be a (resonance) vibration, impact loading or shock waves. This high damping capacity finds its origin in the thermoelastic martensitic phase due to the hysteretic mobility of martensite-variants or different phase interfaces. The damping capacity increases with increasing amplitude of the applied vibration or impact and is almost frequency independent. Special interest exists moreover for damping extreme large displacements by applying the mechanical hysteresis performed during pseudoelastic loading. This aspect is nowadays very strongly studied as a tool for protecting buildings against earthquakes in seismic active regions. Active damping can be obtained in hybrid composites by controlling the recovery stresses or strains of embedded shape memory alloy wires. This controls the internal energy of a structure which allows controlled modal modification and tuning of the dynamical properties of structural elements.

Dealing with intrinsic damping capacity of martensitic phases, several new observations are described, like 'universal' low-temperature high-damping properties of ternary Cu-based alloys, high non-linear damping capacity of a binary NiTi in R phase and high linear damping of binary hydrogen-charged NiTi. Based on the analysis of results of recent studies of damping in NiTi (B 19$\prime$ martensite, R phase) and Cu-based families of alloys (Cu-Al-Ni, Cu-Zn-Al, Cu-Al-Be), we try to introduce a guideline relating desired damping properties of a SMA with its structural characteristics. Among the parameters determining the contribution of specific defect species to damping we suggest considering density of specific type of defects (intervariant boundaries and internal defects of variants like dislocations and twins); their mobility (determined by crystallography and geometrical factors, like accommodation and size of martensitic variants); concentration and type of obstacles impeding the motion of defect species and, thus, producing damping (concentration, mobility and distribution of quenched-in/point-like defects, precipitates, etc).

The shaker is an electromechanical device that provides a mechanical motion due to the input signal sent to its coil. Despite being widely used, it is well known that the shaker interacts with the structure under test. In particular, when the structure passes through a given resonance, the force delivered by the shaker abruptly decreases, causing the so called drop off phenomenon. This paper aims to study this force drop off phenomenon in the single shaker modal testing. Analytical models are developed to help in understanding the physical principles involved in the interaction between the shaker and the structure under test. Experimental analyses are performed using different shakers as well as excitation signals, in order to evaluate the effects of the input signal, as well as the power amplifier operational modes, on the structure dynamics. Preliminary tests revealed that significant distortions might occur during vibration tests using shakers and these distortions significantly affect the determination of the structure response.},

 abstract = {This paper studies the unsteady aerodynamics of vibrating airfoils in the low reduced frequency regime with special emphasis on its impact on the scaling of the work-per-cycle curves by means of numerical experiments. Simulations using a frequency domain linearized Navier--Stokes solver have been carried out on rows of a low-pressure turbine (LPT) airfoil section, the NACA0012 and NACA65 profiles, and a flat-plate cascade operating at different flow conditions. Both the traveling wave (TW) and the influence coefficient (IC) formulations of the problem are used in combination to investigate the nature of the unsteady pressure perturbations. All the theoretical conclusions derived in Part I of the paper have been confirmed, and it is shown that the behavior of the unsteady pressure modulus and phase, as well as the work-per-cycle curves, are fairly independent of the geometry of the airfoil, the operating conditions, and the mode-shape in first-order approximation in the reduced frequency. The second major conclusion is that the airfoil loading and the symmetry of the cascade play an essential role in this trend. Simulations performed at reduced frequency ranges beyond the low reduced frequency limit reveal that, in this regimen, the ICs modulus varies linearly with the reduced frequency, while the phase is always \textgreek{p}/2, and then, the classical sinusoidal antisymmetric shape of work-per-cycle curves in the low reduced frequency limit turns into a cosinusoidal symmetric shape. It is then concluded that the classical cosinusoidal shape of compressor airfoils is not neither a geometric nor a flow effect, but a direct consequence of the fact that the natural frequencies of the lowest modes of compressors are higher than that of high aspect ratio cantilever LPT rotor blades. Numerical simulations have also confirmed that the actual mode-shape of the airfoil motion does not alter the conclusions derived in Part I of the paper.},

This force coexists with the fluctuating force which arises from vortex shedding on a stationary cylinder, and the two forces are assumed to be uncorrelated. The ability of the device used in representing the motion-induced force to model certain aeroelastic characteristics associated with vibrating cylinders is demonstrated. The device is shown to be capable of successfully reproducing two effects; namely, the increase of the spanwise correlation of forces with increasing amplitude, and the phenomenon of ``lock in'' where the shedding frequency is apparently dictated by the vibration frequency. The model is developed within the framework of random-vibration theory, and a number of simplifying assumptions are necessary to incorporate the nonlinear aerodynamic damping force and also to account for the influence of turbulence. Numerical experiments, undertaken to examine the nature of the approximations involved in the assumptions adopted, are described. The results of the numerical experiments are very encouraging and justify the simplifications made in the modelling process.},

Periodic solutions of systems with friction are difficult to investigate because of the non-smooth nature of friction laws. This paper examines periodic solutions and most notably stick--slip, on a simple one-degree-of-freedom system (mass, spring, damper, and belt), with Coulomb's friction law, and with a regularized friction law (i.e. the friction coefficient becomes a function of relative speed, with a stiffness parameter). With Coulomb's law, the stick--slip solution is constructed step by step, which gives a usable existence condition. With the regularized law, the Asymptotic Numerical Method and the Harmonic Balance Method provide bifurcation diagrams with respect to the belt speed or normal force, and for several values of the regularization parameter. Formulations from the Coulomb case give the means of a comparison between regularized solutions and a standard reference. With an appropriate definition, regularized stick--slip motion exists, its amplitude increases with respect to the belt speed and its pulsation decreases with respect to the normal force.},

 abstract = {Impact damping is a method for improving damping of a dynamic system by means of energy dissipation due to repeated collisions of a free mass on the base structure. This paper deals with the theoretical and experimental investigations carried out to study and characterize damping with respect to the level of base excitation. The mathematical model consists of a two degree of freedom system (in which the main system is modelled as single degree of freedom system (sdof)) which undergoes momentum transfer between main mass and impact mass. The velocity response obtained from the mathematical model for the main mass and impact mass clearly indicates that the damping of the system depends on the number of effective impacts and not on the total number of impacts. Here the effect of impact damping is studied for low frequency and high amplitude excitation. Optimum parameters are determined for design of impact damper based on the mathematical model. Experiments are conducted on a cantilever beam for various excitation levels. The damping characteristics obtained from test data are compared with the predictions made from mathematical model. A good match is obtained between theoretical and experimental results. It is also observed that the energy gets re-distributed to higher modes due to the high shock that occurs during collision of the impact mass with main mass. $\backslash$textcopyright 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

First the equilibrium shapes of the loop with varying static loads and lengths are studied. The analysis reveals a large degree of stiffness tunability; the stiffness is dependent on the geometric configuration, which itself is determined by the supported mass, loop length, and loop self-weight. Free vibration frequencies and mode shapes are also found. Finally, the case of forced vibration is studied, and the displacement transmissibility over a large range of forcing frequencies is determined for varying parameter values.

An annular sector cascade has been employed in which the middle blade has been made oscillating in controlled three-dimensional rigid-body modes. Unsteady blade surface pressure data were acquired at midspan on the oscillating blade and two pairs of nonoscillating neighbor blades and reduced to aeroelastic stability data. The test program covered variations in reduced frequency, flow velocity, and inflow incidence; at each operating point, a set of three orthogonal modes was tested such as to allow for generation of stability plots by mode recombination. At nominal incidence, it has been found that increasing reduced frequency has a stabilizing effect on all modes. The analysis of mode shape sensitivity yielded that the most stable modes are of bending type with axial to chordwise character whereas high sensitivity has been found for torsion-dominated modes. Negative incidence operation caused the flow to separate on the fore pressure side. This separation was found to have a destabilizing effect on bending modes of chordwise character, whereas an increase in stability could be noted for bending modes of edgewise character. Variations of stability parameter with inflow incidence have hereby found being largely linear within the range of conditions tested.

In the present study, we focus on the analysis of the regimes of two-dimensional, nonlinear energy transport forming in the special asymptotic limit of low energy excitations. Unlike the previously considered case, this limit can also be characterized by the absence of resonant interactions between the internal rotator and the motion of an outer element. In the considered limit, we report the emergence of all new, highly nonlinear, transient regimes of unidirectional energy channeling. This phenomenon is manifested by partial and complete targeted energy flow from axial to lateral vibrations, controlled by an internal device. Here, we also show that regimes corresponding to the bidirectional energy channeling as well as the spontaneous energy locking reported in the first paper of the series-persist in the low energy limit as well. In this study, we use a regular multi-scale asymptotic procedure and completely unveil the intrinsic mechanisms governing bi- and unidirectional energy channeling.

 abstract = {Emerging blade technologies are finding it increasingly essential to correlate blade vibrations to blade fatigue in order to assess the residual life of existing blading and for development of newer designs. In this paper an analytical code for dynamic stress analysis and fatigue life prediction of blades is presented. The life prediction algorithm is based on a combination method, which combines the local strain approach to predict the initiation life and fracture mechanics approach to predict the propagation life, to estimate the total fatigue life. The conventional stress based approach involving von Mises theory along with S - N - Mean stress diagram suffers from the drawback that it does not make allowance for the possibility of development of plastic strain zones, especially in cases of low cycle fatigue. In the present paper, strain life concepts are employed to analyse the crack initiation phenomenon. Dynamic and static stresses incurred by the blade form inputs to the life estimation algorithm. The modeling is done for a general tapered, twisted and asymmetric cross section blade mounted on a rotating disc at a stagger angle. Blade damping is non-linear in nature and a numerical technique is employed for estimation of blade stresses under typical nozzle excitation. Critical cases of resonant conditions of blade operation are considered. Neuber's rule is applied to the dynamic stresses to obtain the elasto-plastic strains and then the material hysteresis curve is used to iteratively solve for the plastic stress. Static stress effects are accounted for and crack initiation life is estimated by solving the strain life equation. Crack growth formulations are then applied to the initiated crack to analyse the propagation of crack leading to failure. The engineering approximations involved are stated and the algorithm is numerically demonstrated for typical conditions of blade operations. {\copyright} 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

 abstract = {The vibration of grouped blades on a flexible disk cannot be analyzed using procedures developed for individual, uncoupled groups. The bladed-disk system must be considered either in whole, or as a structure composed of cyclically symmetric sectors. The latter approach, while being computationally more economical, is more complicated to implement because both the structural system and the applied forces must be transformed to a system based on the geometry of a single sector. However, the sector transformation permits a natural ordering of the modes that cannot be obtained from a complete system model. This paper describes the development of the sector model, and the associated transformation of the applied harmonic forces typically prevalent in turbomachinery. The displacements are expressed in a series of the natural modes of a transformed sector, and expressions are developed for maximum displacements of the complete structure. This approach leads to an easier interpretation of the analytical results and an improved physical understanding of the response. For example, it is shown that a single harmonic, or engine-order excitation, can cause response in only a restricted subset of modes.},

modelling  and  analysis  methods  are  among  the  key  research

technologies.  In the presented work, a robust design optimiza-

tion of a first stage high pressure turbine blade has been carried

out.  This blade derives from a current production of a Rolls-

Royce aero engine.

The motivation of this work is to show that the methodology

of robust design optimization can be applied to high pressure

turbine blades. A fully automated workflow, which encapsulated

the integral blade design and analysis process, has been used.

The main workflow objective is a representative life value of the

external surface of the blade. In addition, the workflow enables

the engineering uses to consider sub objectives like mass, effi-

ciency and life at critical locations of the blade. These can also

be taken into account in the multi-objective robust design op-

timization.  This research also focuses on the use of surrogate

models, with attention to the delivery of a physically correct re-

sult. For this purpose, the validation of the applied methods has

a huge significance and a toolbox was created to generate and

evaluate the quality of the surrogate models.

In the present case sixteen geometry parameters were con-

sidered. In order to show that this methodology is not limited to

geometry variation,  parameters for material specification and

for  boundary  conditions  were  varied  in  addition.   The  surrogate  model  was  trained  by  the  workflow  generated  DoE-data

and could be used for different kinds of optimization.

As a conclusion, it has been demonstrated that the method-

ology can be used for the engineering design process of turbine

blades, while delivering physically correct results.  The differ-

ent techniques for surrogate modelling were examined and com-

pared. With the help of these surrogate models, an optimization

of life,  mass and efficiency with

22.5

million evaluations was

possible.  Finally, an overview of the methodology for the case

of a real world turbine blade could be given, and an improved

blade in the sense of multi-objective robust design was found.},

The authors have recently published some results on a very classical topic, the dynamics of a softening Duffing oscillator under harmonic excitation focusing especially on low-frequency excitation (von Wagner in Arch Appl Mech 86(8):1383--1390, 2016). In this paper, it was shown that classical tools like harmonic balance and perturbation analysis may produce artificial solutions when applied without extra carefulness with respect to parameter ranges in the case of perturbation analysis or prior knowledge about the type of solution in case of harmonic balance. In the present paper these results are shortly summarized as they give the starting point for the additional investigations described herein. First, the method of slowly changing phase and amplitude is reviewed with respect to its capability of determining asymptotic stability of stationary solutions. It is shown that this method can also produce artifact results when applied without extra carefulness. As next example an extended Duffing oscillator is investigated, which shows, if harmonic balance is applied, ``islands'' of solutions. Using the error criterion in harmonic balance as described in von Wagner (2016) again artifact solutions can be identified.},

Adding an error criterion taking into account the neglected terms allows an evaluation of the results. Looking on the therefore determined error for increasing ansatz orders, it can be evaluated whether a solution really exists or is an artifact. For the low-error solutions additionally a stability analysis is performed which allows the classification of the solutions in three types, namely in large error solutions, low error stable solutions and low error unstable solution. Examples considered in this paper are the classical Duffing oscillator and an extended Duffing oscillator with nonlinear damping and excitation.

This paper investigates the flutter phenomenon of low pressure turbine (LPT) blades seen in aircraft engines and power turbines.

An emphasis is placed on revealing the underlying physics behind the threatening LPT flutter mechanism. To this end, flutter sensitivity analysis is conducted on three key parameters: reduced frequency, mode shape, and Mach number. Additionally, exact 2D acoustic resonance interblade phase angles (IBPAs) are analytically predicted as a function of reduced frequency. Made evident via damping versus IBPA plots, the CFD model successfully captures the theoretical acoustic resonance predictions. Studies of the decay of unsteady aerodynamic influence coefficients away from a reference blade are also presented. The influence coefficients provide key insights to the harmonic content of the unsteady pressure field. Finally, this work explores methods of normalizing the work per cycle by the exit dynamic pressure.},

 abstract = {The mistuning problem of quasi-periodic structures has been the subject of numerous scientific investigations for more than 50 years. Researchers developed reduced-order models to reduce the computational costs of mistuning investigations including finite element models. One question which has also high practical relevance is the identification of mistuning based on modal properties. In this work, a new identification method based on the subset of nominal system modes method (SNM) is presented. Different to existing identification methods where usually the blade stiffness of each sector is scaled by a scalar value, N identification parameters are used to adapt the modal blade stiffness of each sector. The input data for the identification procedure consist solely of the mistuned natural frequencies of the investigated mode family as well as of the corresponding mistuned mode shapes in the form of one degree-of-freedom per sector. The reduction basis consists of the tuned mode shapes of the investigated mode family. Furthermore, the proposed identification method allows for the inclusion of centrifugal effects like stress stiffening and spin softening without additional computational effort. From this point of view, the presented method is also appropriate to handle centrifugal effects in reduced-order models using a minimum set of input data compared to existing methods. The power of the new identification method is demonstrated on the example of an axial compressor blisk. Finite element calculations including geometrical mistuning provide the database for the identification procedure. The correct functioning of the identification method including measurement noise is also validated to show the applicability to a case of application where real measurement data are available.},

@article{Wall.2022,
 abstract = {The goal of this paper is to present a set of measurements from a benchmark structure containing two bolted joints to support future efforts to predict the damping due to the joints and to model nonlinear coupling between the first two elastic modes. Bolted joints introduce nonlinearities in structures, typically causing a softening in the natural frequency and an increase in damping because of frictional slip between the contact interfaces within the joint. These nonlinearities pose significant challenges when characterizing the response of the structure under a large range of load amplitudes, especially when the modal responses become coupled, causing the effective damping and natural frequency to not only depend on the excitation amplitude of the targeted mode, but also the relative amplitudes of other modes. In this work, two nominally identical benchmark structures, known in some prior works as the S4 beam, are tested to characterize their nonlinear properties for the first two elastic modes. Detailed surface measurements are presented and validated through finite element analysis and reveal distinct contact interactions between the two sets of beams. The free-free test structures are excited with an impact hammer and the transient response is analyzed to extract the damping and frequency backbone curves. A range of impact amplitudes and drive points are used to isolate a single mode or to excite both modes simultaneously. Differences in the nonlinear response correlate with the relative strength of the modes that are excited, allowing one to characterize mode coupling. Each of the beams shows different nonlinear properties for each mode, which is attributed to the different contact pressure distributions between the parts, although the mode coupling relationship is found to be consistent between the two. The test data key finding are presented in this paper and the supporting data is available on a public repository for interested researchers.},

 abstract = {The normal repeated impact of a sphere upon an elastic-plastic beam has been analyzed experimentally and theoretically. Hertz elastic contact model and seven well known elastic-plastic contact models were selected for theoretical analysis. A piecewise linearized method has been presented to linearize the nonlinear contact stiffness of eight selected contact models. Generalized closed-form solutions (theoretical solutions) of repeated impact response were derived for each piecewise linearization by vibration theory. Ahead of the theoretical study, to gain a deep insight into the eight selected contact models, an idealized repeated impact problem of elastic-plastic half space/foundation was solved by Runge--Kutta integration method. The numerical results show that the models are of large differences in predicting contact behavior, and reveal a strong correlation of the models with the two model parameters: the indentation of initial contact yield and the effective radius of contact curvature of unloading. Experiments were performed with regard to a repeated impact process of a sphere striking repeatedly at the center of the beam. The theoretical and experimental results show that selecting the appropriate contact model is very important on predicting contact behavior. No significant advantage of indentation type has been found over flattening type among these contact models. The divergences of contact behavior and the strong correlation for the eight contact models still exist. Compared with the experimental results, for the coefficient of restitution and the rebound velocity of the sphere, all of the eight contact models predict larger values and contrary trends on impact velocity compared to the experimental results. The reasons may come from wave effects and sub-impact phenomenon.},

@article{Warren.2011,
 abstract = {Today, accelerometers and laser Doppler vibrometers are widely accepted as valid measurement tools for structural dynamic measurements. However, limitations of these transducers prevent the accurate measurement of some phenomena. For example, accelerometers typically measure motion at a limited number of discrete points and can mass load a structure. Scanning laser vibrometers have a very wide frequency range and can measure many points without mass-loading, but are sensitive to large displacements and can have lengthy acquisition times due to sequential measurements. Image-based stereo-photogrammetry techniques provide additional measurement capabilities that compliment the current array of measurement systems by providing an alternative that favors high-displacement and low-frequency vibrations typically difficult to measure with accelerometers and laser vibrometers. Within this paper, digital image correlation, three-dimensional (3D) point-tracking, 3D laser vibrometry, and accelerometer measurements are all used to measure the dynamics of a structure to compare each of the techniques. Each approach has its benefits and drawbacks, so comparative measurements are made using these approaches to show some of the strengths and weaknesses of each technique. Additionally, the displacements determined using 3D point-tracking are used to calculate frequency response functions, from which mode shapes are extracted. The image-based frequency response functions (FRFs) are compared to those obtained by collocated accelerometers. Extracted mode shapes are then compared to those of a previously validated finite element model (FEM) of the test structure and are shown to have excellent agreement between the FEM and the conventional measurement approaches when compared using the Modal Assurance Criterion (MAC) and Pseudo-Orthogonality Check (POC).},

 abstract = {An investigation of the effects of small structural irregularities on the dynamics of nearly periodic structures with cyclic symmetry is presented. The system studied may be regarded as a simple model of a continuously shrouded blade assembly accounting for one structural mode per blade. A key aspect of the approach is the use of perturbation methods that lead to a physical insight into the effects of mistuning. The study shows that the sensitivity to mistuning depends primarily upon the ratio of mistuning strength to coupling strength. For a small mistuning to coupling ratio, the mistuned system behaves like a perturbation of the corresponding tuned system, in which case mistuning has a relatively small effect on both the free and forced responses. On the other hand, for a large mistuning to coupling ratio (i.e., weak coupling), the mistuned system behaves like a perturbation of the corresponding decoupled mistuned system, in which case small mistuning dramatically changes the dynamics of the system. This paper, Part I, investigates the effects of small mistuning on the free response of the system. Specifically, it is shown that strong mode localization and eigenvalue loci veering phenomena occur in the weakly coupled system when mistuning is introduced. The effects of mistuning on the forced response are studied in the companion paper, Part II (Wei and Pierre, 1987).},

Perturbation methods for the forced response are developed to gain a physical insight into the effects of mistuning. The study shows that the internal coupling between component systems is the key parameter governing the sensitivity to mistuning and that localized forced vibrations do occur in the disordered assembly for weak internal coupling. However, although both localized free and forced vibrations occur for finite or large values of the mistuning to coupling ratio, the deflection patterns for these two types of localized vibrations are different. Also, for the forced response, the degree of localization does not necessarily increase as this ratio increases---a fundamental difference from localized free modes. An important conclusion is that the common periodicity assumption for cyclic structures may lead to qualitative errors for the forced response of weakly coupled systems when small mistuning is present.},

Due to the geometry of the dry friction damping element, the friction force grows linearly with the beam's transverse displacement. Harmonic excitation of the system is analyzed using first order harmonic balance and then using an ``exact'' time domain method. The stick-slip behaviour of the system has also been studied. Even though the only source of damping is dry friction, the system was seen to exhibit damping characteristics similar to linear structural damping. The equivalent natural frequency and equivalent viscous damping were also investigated, and found to depend on the amplitude of response and on the design parameters of the frictional interface. In particular, the overall damping levels as well as the amount of stick-slip motion are seen to depend strongly on the amount of displacement dependence. Another significant result was the appearance of two stable steady-state solutions at certain parameter values. The results suggest that the overall characteristics of mechanical systems may be improved by properly configuring frictional interfaces to allow normal forces to vary with displacement.},

The system model uses a ramp configuration to increase the normal force of the dry friction damper proportional to the beam's transverse displacement. The system is studied by using harmonic balance as an approximate analytical solution and then by using a time integration method. Interesting findings include the appearance of internal resonance peaks when multiple beam modes are considered. Also, as with the earlier single-degree-of-freedom study, two dynamic response solutions exist at certain parameter values. It is found that the ability to control the amplitude of the response is a function of the frequency range considered. In general, near modal resonance peaks, the amplitude of the response decreases with increasing ramp angle. However, in an ``overlapping'' region between resonance peaks, the amplitude of the response actually increases with increasing ramp angle. It is also found that the damping contribution from the displacement-dependent dry friction damper is ``linear structural-like'' in nature and relatively insensitive to the amplitude of the response. This result suggests that in the case of turbine or compressor blades, this type of damping arrangement may be effective in the suppression of flutter.},

 abstract = {The paper considers the free, undamped vibrations of rotating, circumferentially periodic structures. Due to the rotation Coriolis effects are present as well as centrifugal and geometric stiffness effects. It proves to be the presence of Coriolis effects, represented by skew-symmetry in the equations of motion, that the natural modes of the system consist of backward and forward rotating mode shapes. The backward and forward rotating mode shapes with the same wave number inherently vibrate with different frequencies. Therefore, standing natural mode shapes cannot be found in rotating, circumferentially periodic structures (except in those cases where the deflection is the same at corresponding points on every substructure in which case the mode shape may be interpreted as standing).



A method of complex constraints is applied to the substructures which reduces the equations of motion for the complete structure to a set of equations of motion pertaining to a single substructure. The number of equations is reduced in the same proportions and the computational benefits are dramatic.



As an application the in-plane vibrations of the rotating regular polygon consisting of point masses and massless springs are studied. For this example some interesting features are found. Under certain circumstances double latent roots are found, but there is only one associated latent vector. Under certain other circumstances the possible natural frequencies of vibration are dependent on the angular velocity of rotation. In particular, when the rotational velocity is increased from zero and reaches a threshold value an additional natural mode of vibration appears. In fact, the frequency of vibration of this mode is zero, but as soon as the rotational velocity has increased beyond the threshold value, the natural frequency of vibration of the newly-born mode shape is greater than zero. The phenomenon may be regarded as the birth of a natural mode shape.},

 abstract = {A circumferentially periodic structure consists of a finite number of identical substructures coupled together in identical ways to form a closed ring-type structure. The vibrational behaviour of such structures when rotating about the axis of structural symmetry is considered, especially the forced response due to forces fixed in space. It is known that for a circumferentially symmetric structure, rotating about its axis of structural symmetry and excited by a force fixed in space, resonance for the n nodal diameters mode is obtained when the corresponding natural frequency is \textgreek{w}n = n\textgreek{W}, where \textgreek{W} is the angular velocity of rotation. The deformation at these resonances consists of waves travelling backwards (in relation to the direction of the structure rotation). This resonance condition also holds for a circumferentially periodic structure. But then additional resonance possibilities exist, given by \textgreek{w}n = (kN $\pm$ n)\textgreek{W}, where N is the number of sub-structures and k = 0, 1, 2, $\ldots$. These results are known to hold true for a structure fixed in space and acted upon by a rotating force. In this paper these results are shown to hold true also for a rotating structure acted upon by a force distribution fixed in space. Both backward and forward travelling waves can be excited. In those cases when the rotating structure exhibits Coriolis accelerations the natural frequencies for backward (\textgreek{w}1n) and forward (\textgreek{w}2n) rotating mode shapes are different. This well-known property has a pronounced effect on the forced response due to forces fixed in space. In the absence of Coriolis effects the magnification factor is essentially 1/(\textgreek{w}n{\^{}}2-\textgreek{w}{\^{}}2), where \textgreek{w} is the forcing frequency due to rotation. But in the presence of Coriolis effects the magnification factor has the characteristics 1/(\textgreek{w}1n-\textgreek{w})(\textgreek{w}2n+\textgreek{w}).},

Tribol., 126, pp. 28--33) the author developed a halfspace model for the elasto-plastic normal contact of rough surfaces. This model is now used to study the influence of intrinsic surface parameters on constitutive contact laws, such as load-gap relation and load-area relation, for a specific type of surface topography known as fractal-regular surfaces. Numerical investigations show that the fractal dimension has only minor influence on the load-gap relationship, which is mostly determined by the dimensionless ratio between the transition length and the rms values of the height data. Due to the fractal nature of the surfaces at the small wavelength limit, initial deformation will always be in the plastic range. The load-area relation becomes then completely independent of the geometric surface parameters and is determined by material properties alone, at least if the predicted plastic deformation occurs at a length scale larger than the atomic scale.},

 abstract = {The effect of dry metallic friction can be attributed to two major mechanisms: adhesion and ploughing. While ploughing is related to severe wear and degradation, adhesion can be connected to pure elastic deformations of the contacting bodies and is thus the predominant mechanism in a stable friction pair. The transmitted friction force is then proportional to the real area of contact. Therefore, a lot of effort has been put into the determination of the fraction of real area of contact under a given load. A broad spectrum of analytical and numerical models has been employed. However, it is quite common to employ the so-called Mindlin assumptions, where the contact area is determined by the normal load only, disregarding the influence of friction. In the subsequent tangential loading, usually the contact pressure distribution is kept fixed such that the coupling between the tangential and normal solutions is neglected. Here, a numerical solution scheme based on elastic halfspace theory for frictional contact problems is presented where full coupling between the normal and tangential tractions and displacements is taken into account. Several examples show the influence of the coupling effects, but also the limitations for the analysis of rough contacts.},

The dynamic analysis (time integration) of such systems with direct non-linear Finite Element codes, which do not utilize a modal condensation, has the disadvantage of an unacceptably high computational effort, due to the huge number of nodal DOF's. In the literature, modal condensation techniques have been presented for linear problems. In the present contribution, an extension of the latter common mode bases is suggested in order to account for the local non-linear characteristics of the joints. For that sake, special modes, which we call joint interface modes, are added to an existing mode base in order to compute the state due to non-linear joint forces with a sufficient accuracy. The number of the additional joint interface modes is significantly smaller than the number of modes necessary for the classical Component Mode Synthesis of the structure with linearized joint conditions.

The second algorithm relies on a high-order Taylor series expansion of the solution path (asymptotic numerical method) and classical Harmonic Balance formulated entirely in the frequency domain (cHB-ANM). We conclude that the cHB-ANM is suited for smooth nonlinearities, for instance geometrically nonlinear finite element models.

 abstract = {It is well-known that nonlinear dry friction damping has the potential to bound the otherwise unboundedly growing vibrations of self-excited structures. An important technical example are the flutter-induced friction-damped limit cycle oscillations of turbomachinery blade rows. Due to symmetries, natural frequencies are inevitably closely spaced, and they can generally be multiples of each other. Not much is known on the nonlinear dynamics of self-excited friction-damped systems in the presence of such internal resonances. In this work, we analyze this situation numerically by regarding a two degrees-of-freedom system. We demonstrate that in the case of closely-spaced natural frequencies, the self-excitation of the lower-frequency mode gives rise to non-periodic oscillations, and the occurrence of unbounded behavior well before reaching the maximum friction damping value. If the system is close to a 1:3 internal resonance, limit cycles associated with much higher frictional damping appear, however, most of these are unstable. If more than one mode is subjected to self-excitation, the maximum resistance against self-excitation is at least given by the damping capacity of the most weakly friction-damped mode. These results are of high technical relevance, as the prevailing practice is to analyze only periodic limit states and argue the stability solely by the slope of the damping-amplitude curve. Our results demonstrate that this practice leads to considerable mis- and overestimation of the resistance against self-excitation, and a more rigorous stability analysis is required.},

 abstract = {A characteristic feature of nonlinear vibrations is the energy transfer among different parts or modes of a mechanical system. Moreover, nonlinear vibrations are often non-periodic, even at steady state. To analyze these phenomena experimentally, the vibration response must be measured at multiple locations in a time-synchronous way. For this task, piezoelectric accelerometers are by far the most popular technology. While the effect of attached sensors on linear vibration properties is well-known (mass loading in particular), the purpose of the present work is to assess their intrusiveness on nonlinear vibrations. To this end, we consider a compressor blade that undergoes impacts near the tip for sufficiently large vibrations. We consider two configurations, one in which five triaxial piezoelectric accelerometers are glued to the blade surface and one without sensors attached. In both configurations, the vibration response is measured using a multi-point laser Doppler vibrometer. In the linear case without impacts, the lowest-frequency bending mode merely sees the expected slight frequency shift due to mass loading. In the nonlinear vibro-impact case, unexpectedly, the near-resonant response to harmonic base excitation changes severely both quantitatively and qualitatively. In particular, pronounced strongly modulated responses and period doubling are observed only in the case without attached sensors. We conjecture that this is due to a considerable increase of damping, caused by the sensor cables, affecting mainly the higher-frequency modes.},

The comprehensive study examines the effects of cycling, oscillation frequency, strain amplitude, temperature, and static strain offset on the pseudoelastic stress-strain hysteresis of SMA wires under axial loading. Experimental data are obtained for complete austenite-martensite transformation hysteresis as well as partial transformation hysteresis. The results indicate that as the frequency of excitation increases, the reverse phase transformation from detwinned martensite to austenite commences at higher stress levels, and the area of the hysteresis loop decreases. This results in a rapid initial decrease in energy dissipation, but approaches a stable level by about 10 Hz. The energy dissipation at 10 Hz was found to be about 50{\%} of that observed at very low frequencies. The energy dissipated at higher temperatures was found to be up to 40{\%} lower than that observed at 90°F. The energy dissipated per cycle was found to be larger when lower values of static strain offset were used.},

Furthermore interface laws will be discussed for the normal and tangential stress components in the contact area. Different variational formulations can be applied to treat the variational inequalities due to contact. Several of these different techniques will be presented. Furthermore the discretization of a contact problem in time and space is of great importance and has to be chosen with regard to the nature of the contact problem.

 abstract = {Physical and engineering systems are often subjected to combined harmonic and random excitations. The random excitation is often modeled as Gaussian white noise for mathematical tractability. However in practice, the random excitation is nonwhite. This paper investigates the stationary response probability density of strongly nonlinear oscillators under combined harmonic and wide-band noise excitations. By using generalized harmonic functions, a new stochastic averaging procedure for estimating stationary response probability density of strongly nonlinear oscillators under combined harmonic and wideband noise excitations is developed. The damping can be linear and (or) nonlinear and the excitations can be external and (or) parametric. After stochastic averaging, the system state is represented by two-dimensional time-homogeneous diffusive Markov processes. The method of reduced Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation is used to investigate the stationary response of the vibration system. A nonlinearly damped Duffing oscillator is taken as an example to show the application and validity of the method. In the case of primary external resonance, based on the stationary joint probability density of amplitude and phase difference, the stochastic jump of the Duffing oscillator and P-bifurcation as the system parameters change are examined for the first time. The agreement between the analytical results and those from Monte Carlo simulation of original system shows that the proposed procedure works quite well. Copyright {\copyright} 2008 by ASME.},

@book{Wu.2018b,
 abstract = {Dynamic analysis of large-size finite element models has been commonly applied by mechanical engineers to simulate the dynamic behavior of complex structures. The ever-increasing demand for both detailed and accurate simulation of complex structures forces mechanical engineers to pursue a balance between two conflicting goals during the simulations: low computational cost and high accuracy. These goals become extremely difficult for geometric nonlinear structural dynamical problems. When geometrical nonlinearities are introduced, the internal force vector and Jacobians are configuration dependent, and the corresponding updates are computationally expensive. This thesis presents nonlinear model order reduction techniques that aim to perform detailed dynamic analysis of multi-component structures with reduced computational cost, without degrading the accuracy too much. Special attention is given to flexible multibody system dynamics.{\&}lt;br/{\&}gt;{\&}lt;br/{\&}gt;For multi-component structures featuring many interface degrees of freedom, standard substructuring dynamics can be combined with interface reduction techniques to obtain compact reduced order models. Chapter{\~{}}2 summarized a variety of interface reduction techniques for the well-known Craig-Bampton substructuring method. These approaches are reviewed and compared in terms of both computational cost and accuracy. A multilevel interface reduction method is presented as a more generalized approach, where a secondary Craig-Bampton reduction is performed when the subsystems are assembled within localized subsets. The multilevel interface reduction method provides an accurate representation of the full linear model with significantly lower computational cost. {\&}lt;br/{\&}gt;{\&}lt;br/{\&}gt;In Chapter{\~{}}3, we extend the Craig-Bampton method to geometric nonlinear problems by augmenting the system-level interface modes and internal vibration modes of each substructure with their corresponding modal derivatives. The modal derivatives are capable of describing the bending-stretching coupling effects exhibited by geometric nonlinear structures. Once the reduced order model is constructed by Galerkin projection, the upcoming challenge is the computation of the reduced nonlinear internal force vectors and tangent matrices during the time integration. The evaluation of these objects scales with the size of the full order model, and it is therefore expensive, as it needs to be repeated multiple time within every time step of the time integration. To address this problem, we directly express the reduced nonlinear vectors and matrices as a polynomial function of the modal coordinates, using substructure-level higher-order tensors with much smaller size. This enhanced Craig-Bampton method offers flexibility for reduced modal basis construction, as modal derivatives need to be computed only for substructures actually featuring geometrical nonlinearities, and do not need the prior knowledge of the nonlinear response of the full system with training load cases.{\&}lt;br/{\&}gt;{\&}lt;br/{\&}gt;For flexible multibody systems, each body undergoes both overall rigid body motion and flexible behavior. To describe the dynamic behavior of each body accurately, the floating frame of reference is commonly applied. In Chapter{\~{}}4, the enhanced Craig-Bampton method, as proposed in Chapter{\~{}}3, is embedded in the floating frame of reference. We consider here structures modeled with von-Karman beam elements. Interface reduction methods are in this context unnecessary since the adjacent bodies are connected through a single node. The proposed reduction method constitutes a natural and effective extension of the classical linear modal reduction in the floating frame.{\&}lt;br/{\&}gt;{\&}lt;br/{\&}gt;For more complex geometries, like wind turbine blades, extremely simplified beam models can not capture the complexity of the real three-dimensional structure, and therefore the dynamic behavior might not be accurately modeled. In Chapter{\~{}}5, we present an enhanced Rubin substructuring method for three-dimensional nonlinear multibody systems. The standard Rubin reduction basis is augmented with the modal derivatives of both the free-interface vibration modes and the attachment modes to include bending-stretching coupling effects triggered by the nonlinear vibrations. When compared to the enhanced Craig-Bampton method proposed in Chapter{\~{}}4, the enhanced Rubin method better reproduces the geometrical nonlinearities occurring at the interface, and, as a consequence, higher accuracy can be achieved.{\&}lt;br/{\&}gt;{\&}lt;br/{\&}gt;In Chapter{\~{}}6, the overall conclusions are drawn and recommendations for further study are provided.{\&}lt;br/{\&}gt;},

techniques are used to maximize a weighted quadratic norm of the

response of the degrees-of-freedom of blade 1 (overall response of

which the resonant mistuned mode shape(s) (1 for engine orders 0 and

N/2 where N is the number of blades, 2 otherwise) is selected to

maximize the overall response of blade 1. The form of these optimum

mode shapes is derived for all weighting matrices. The specific mode

shapes are also derived for two particular weights the first one of

which depends on the tuned bladed disk mass matrix and for which the

overall response is akin to the kinetic energy. A closed form solution is

also derived when the analysis focuses solely on the response of a

specific degree-of-freedom or a specific stress component. In these

cases, the ratio of the corresponding overall response to its tuned

counterpart, i.e. the amplification factor, is found to be the product of

two terms. The first one is an amplification obtained by tuned

variations of the blade properties/mode shapes and thus is referred to

as the modal amplification factor. The second term is an amplification

obtained by proper mistuning. Interestingly, the modal amplification

factor may take on very large values while a representative value of

the largest mistuned factor is often the Whitehead limit

of (1 + N )/ 2 as in the single-degree-of-freedom per blade model.

The above formulation and results are readily extended to the

optimization of the blade alone response (as opposed to blade and disk

Numerical optimization efforts were also undertaken on both a

two-degree-of-freedom per blade disk model and a 24-blade blisk

only confirm the assumptions and findings of the theoretical

developments but also demonstrate that substantially larger

amplification factors can be obtained with a general natural frequency

mistuning as opposed to Young's modulus mistuning. Finally, an

 abstract = {A composite high-aspect-ratio wing of a high-altitude long-endurance (HALE) aircraft was modeled with FEM by MSC/NASTRAN, and the nonlinear static equilibrium state is calculated under design load with follower force effect, but without load redistribution. Assuming the little vibration amplitude of the wing around the static equilibrium state, the system is linearized and the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the deformed structure are obtained. Planar doublet lattice method is used to calculate unsteady aerodynamics in frequency domain ignoring the bending effect of the deflected wing. And then, the aeroelastic stability analysis of the system under a given load condition is successively carried out. Comparing with the linear results, the nonlinear displacement of the wing tip is higher. The results indicate that the critical nonlinear flutter is of the flap/chordwise bending type because of the chordwise bending having quite a large torsion component, with low critical speed and slowly growing damping, which dose not appear in the linear analysis. Furthermore, it is shown that the variation of the nonlinear flutter speed depends on the scale of the load and on the chordwise bending frequency. The research work indicates that, for the very flexible HALE aircraft, the nonlinear aeroelastic stability is very important, and should be considered in the design progress. Using present FEM software as the structure solver (e.g. MSC/NASTRAN), and the unsteady aerodynamic code, the nonlinear aeroelastic stability margin of a complex system other than a simple beam model can be determined.},

The method of incremental harmonic balance (IHB) technique that hysteresis is considered in the corrective term is improved in order to determine periodic solutions of bilinear hysteretic systems. The improved continuation method called two points tracing algorithm which is stable to the turning point makes the calculation more efficient for tracing amplitude-frequency response. Precise Hsu's method for analysing the stability of periodic solutions is introduced. The effects of different parameters of bilinear hysteretic oscillator on the response are discussed numerically. Some numerical simulations of considered bilinear hysteretic systems, including a single DOF and a 2DOF system, are effectively obtained by the modified IHB method and the results compare very well with the 4-oder Runge-Kutta method.},

Experiments are conducted with a number of arrangements of the packed particles including different particle sizes and volumetric packing ratios. The results show that the particle damping is remarkably effective and that strong attenuations are achieved within a broad frequency range. The effects of the system parameters including particle size, packing ratio and particle material are studied by broadband and narrowband random excitations. The experimental results confirm a numerical prediction that shear friction in the longitudinal (and the latitudinal) directions is effective as the major contributing mechanism of damping in the case.

 abstract = {In turbine jet engine, the rotating blades are subjected to cyclic loading, which makes the blades experience the so-called High Cycle Fatigue (HCF). Dry friction is often employed in turbine design to attenuate the blade vibration and increase aeroelastic stability of the turbine. The dry friction dampers are often classified into four types, i.e., blade-to-blade, blade-to-ground, shrouds, and wedge damper, respectively. Compared with the under-platform dampers, shrouds make fan behavior be significantly more complex. It is very difficult to model and predict the nonlinear response of shrouded blades.

In the present study, an efficient approach to investigate the nonlinear response of the shrouded blades is suggested using an alternating frequency/time domain (AFT) method. On one hand, the friction force between shrouds is numerically solved in time-domain. The trajectory of relative motion of the moving contact point is traced, and the stick-slip-separation transition for 3-D relative motion of the shroud-contact interface is considered. On the other hand, the response of the shrouded blades is iteratively solved in frequency-domain using Harmonic Balance Method (HBM). In this approach, the influence of high frequency modes of blade, and the coupling of each harmonic component on damping behavior can be taken into account.

As an application, the performance of shroud damper is systematically investigated using the AFT method. The influence of shroud-to-shroud preload and contact stiffness on the shroud damping potential is studied. Some valuable results are got to the design of the shroud contact.},

 abstract = {A three-dimensional hybrid structured-unstructured Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solver has been developed to simulate flows in complex turbomachinery geometries. It is built by coupling an existing structured computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver with a newly developed unstructured-grid module via a conservative hybrid-grid interfacing algorithm, so that it can get benefits from the both structured and unstructured grids. The unstructured-grid module has been developed with consistent numerical algorithms, data structure, user interface and parallelization to those of the structured one. The numerical features of the hybrid RANS solver are its second-order accurate upwind scheme in space, its SGS implicit formulation of time integration, and its accurate modeling of steady/unsteady boundary conditions for multistage turbomachinery flows. The hybrid-grid interfacing algorithm is essentially an extension of the conservative zonal approach that has been previously applied on the mismatched zonal interface of the structured grids, and it is fully conservative and also second-order accurate. Due to the mismatched grids allowed at the block interface, users would have great flexibility to build the hybrid grids even with different structured and unstructured grid generators. The performance of the hybrid RANS solver is assessed with a variety of validation and application examples, through which the hybrid RANS solver has been demonstrated to be able to cope with the flows in complex turbomachinery geometries and to be promising for the future industrial applications.

 abstract = {Enhancing the spatial and temporal resolution of vibration measurements and modal analysis could significantly benefit dynamic modelling, analysis, and health monitoring of structures. For example, spatially high-density mode shapes are critical for accurate vibration-based damage localization. In experimental or operational modal analysis, higher (frequency) modes, which may be outside the frequency range of the measurement, contain local structural features that can improve damage localization as well as the construction and updating of the modal-based dynamic model of the structure. In general, the resolution of vibration measurements can be increased by enhanced hardware. Traditional vibration measurement sensors such as accelerometers have high-frequency sampling capacity; however, they are discrete point-wise sensors only providing sparse, low spatial sensing resolution measurements, while dense deployment to achieve high spatial resolution is expensive and results in the mass-loading effect and modification of structure's surface. Non-contact measurement methods such as scanning laser vibrometers provide high spatial and temporal resolution sensing capacity; however, they make measurements sequentially that requires considerable acquisition time. As an alternative non-contact method, digital video cameras are relatively low-cost, agile, and provide high spatial resolution, simultaneous, measurements. Combined with vision based algorithms (e.g., image correlation or template matching, optical flow, etc.), video camera based measurements have been successfully used for experimental and operational vibration measurement and subsequent modal analysis. However, the sampling frequency of most affordable digital cameras is limited to 30--60Hz, while high-speed cameras for higher frequency vibration measurements are extremely costly. This work develops a computational algorithm capable of performing vibration measurement at a uniform sampling frequency lower than what is required by the Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem for output-only modal analysis. In particular, the spatio-temporal uncoupling property of the modal expansion of structural vibration responses enables a direct modal decoupling of the temporally-aliased vibration measurements by existing output-only modal analysis methods, yielding (full-field) mode shapes estimation directly. Then the signal aliasing properties in modal analysis is exploited to estimate the modal frequencies and damping ratios. The proposed method is validated by laboratory experiments where output-only modal identification is conducted on temporally-aliased acceleration responses and particularly the temporally-aliased video measurements of bench-scale structures, including a three-story building structure and a cantilever beam.},

The wave propagation characteristics of the meta-structure were predicted and compared with those obtained by measurements. The reflected wave from the meta-structure was completely blocked at the resonance frequency. The impact between the beam and the tuned dynamic absorbers dissipates the vibration energy. To verify the damping of one tuned dynamic absorber employing impacts, the effective damping ratio was calculated for a vibrating system with a single degree of freedom. Due to vibration reduction during impacts between the system and the absorber, the structural damping ratio was increased significantly without the use of viscoelastic materials. The proposed structure provides an efficient methodology without the use of viscous vibration damping materials in the broadband frequency range, which is essential for applications to at high or low temperatures.},

 abstract = {Experimental or operational modal analysis traditionally requires physically-attached wired or wireless sensors for vibration measurement of structures. This instrumentation can result in mass-loading on lightweight structures, and is costly and time-consuming to install and maintain on large civil structures, especially for long-term applications (e.g., structural health monitoring) that require significant maintenance for cabling (wired sensors) or periodic replacement of the energy supply (wireless sensors). Moreover, these sensors are typically placed at a limited number of discrete locations, providing low spatial sensing resolution that is hardly sufficient for modal-based damage localization, or model correlation and updating for larger-scale structures. Non-contact measurement methods such as scanning laser vibrometers provide high-resolution sensing capacity without the mass-loading effect; however, they make sequential measurements that require considerable acquisition time. As an alternative non-contact method, digital video cameras are relatively low-cost, agile, and provide high spatial resolution, simultaneous, measurements. Combined with vision based algorithms (e.g., image correlation, optical flow), video camera based measurements have been successfully used for vibration measurements and subsequent modal analysis, based on techniques such as the digital image correlation (DIC) and the point-tracking. However, they typically require speckle pattern or high-contrast markers to be placed on the surface of structures, which poses challenges when the measurement area is large or inaccessible. This work explores advanced computer vision and video processing algorithms to develop a novel video measurement and vision-based operational (output-only) modal analysis method that alleviate the need of structural surface preparation associated with existing vision-based methods and can be implemented in a relatively efficient and autonomous manner with little user supervision and calibration. First a multi-scale image processing method is applied on the frames of the video of a vibrating structure to extract the local pixel phases that encode local structural vibration, establishing a full-field spatiotemporal motion matrix. Then a high-spatial dimensional, yet low-modal-dimensional, over-complete model is used to represent the extracted full-field motion matrix using modal superposition, which is physically connected and manipulated by a family of unsupervised learning models and techniques, respectively. Thus, the proposed method is able to blindly extract modal frequencies, damping ratios, and full-field (as many points as the pixel number of the video frame) mode shapes from line of sight video measurements of the structure. The method is validated by laboratory experiments on a bench-scale building structure and a cantilever beam. Its ability for output (video measurements)-only identification and visualization of the weakly-excited mode is demonstrated and several issues with its implementation are discussed.},

 abstract = {Unusual resonant responses were observed during spin pit tests of shrouded blades. The unusual behavior consisted of blades that exhibited strong response over a broad range of frequencies. The frequencies of peak resonance were considerably lower than predicted and were also lower than those observed in other tests of nominally identical wheels. In addition, the tracking plots of blade amplitudes versus frequency were truncated rather than displaying the usual sharp peaks seen in other tests. The unusual response is potentially dangerous since high vibratory response could be excited over a broad range of operating speeds. The blades were designed to be free standing with gaps of approximately 0.25 mm between neighboring shrouds. It is hypothesized that shroud contact at the blade tips could cause the unusual vibratory response. A simple model of a blade with shroud contact is developed in order to determine if shroud contact could cause blades to vibrate in the observed manner. The model is unusual in that it seeks to explore how contact could cause the blade to respond at lower (rather than higher) frequencies since contact typically increases the constraints on a structure and raises its natural frequencies.},

In the proposed model, a contact plane is defined and its orientation is assumed invariant. Consequently, the relative motion of the two contacting surfaces can be resolved into two components: the in-plane tangential motion on the contact plane and the normal component perpendicular to the plane. The in-plane tangential relative motion is often two-dimensional, and it can induce stick-slip friction. On the other hand, the normal relative motion can cause variation of the contact normal load and, in extreme circumstances, separation of the two contacting surfaces. In this study, the joined effect of the 2D tangential relative motion and the normal relative motion on the contact kinematics of a friction contact is examined and analytical criteria are developed to determine the transitions among stick, slip, and separation, when experiencing variable normal load. With these transition criteria, the induced friction force on the contact plane and the variable normal load perpendicular to the plane can be predicted for any given cyclic relative motions at the contact interface and hysteresis loops can be produced so as to characterize the equivalent damping and stiffness of the friction contact. These non-linear damping and stiffness along with the harmonic balance method are then used to predict the resonance of a frictionally constrained 3-DOF oscillator.

 abstract = {In the second part of this paper, the application of the proposed dual-interface model to the prediction of the forced response of a blade constrained by wedge dampers will be presented. When considering cyclic loading, the induced friction forces and contact normal loads are combined so as to determine the effective stiffness and damping of the friction interfaces over a cycle of motion. The harmonic balance method is then used to impose the approximate stiffness and damping of the friction interfaces to a linear structure model of the blade. This approach results in a set of nonlinear algebraic equations that can be solved to yield the forced response of the blade excited by harmonic external forces. The predicted forced response can then be used to optimize a given damper design, namely to determine the dynamic weight at which the maximum reduction of resonant response is obtained. In order to illustrate the capacity of the proposed method and to examine its accuracy, the forced response of a test beam is examined. The prediction is also compared with the results of lab tests to validate the proposed dual-interface friction force model.},

 abstract = {In this paper, the three-dimensional shroud contact kinematics of a shrouded blade system is studied. The assumed blade motion has three components, namely axial, tangential, and radial components, which result in a three dimensional relative motion across the shroud interface. The resulting relative motion can be decomposed into two components. The first one is on the contact plane and can induce stick-slip friction. The other component is perpendicular to the contact plane and can cause variation of the contact normal load and, in extreme circumstances, separation of the two contacting surfaces. In order to estimate the equivalent stiffness and damping of the shroud contact an approach is proposed. In this approach, the in-plane slip motion is assumed to be elliptical and is decomposed into two linear motions along the principal major and minor axes of the ellipse. A variable normal load friction force model (Yang and Menq, 1996) is then applied separately to each individual linear motion, and the equivalent stiffness and damping of the shroud contact can be approximately estimated. With the estimated stiffness and damping, the developed shroud contact model is applied to the prediction of the resonant response of a shrouded blade system. The effects of two different shroud constraint conditions, namely two-dimensional constraint and three-dimensional constraint, on the resonant response of a shrouded blade system are compared and the results are discussed.},

 abstract = {We present a harmonic balance (HB) method to model frequency lock-in effect during vortex-induced vibration (VIV) of elastically mounted circular cylinder and a flexible riser section in a freestream uniform flow. The fluid flow and structure are coupled by a fixed-point iteration process through a frequency updating algorithm. By minimizing the structural residual in the standard least-square norm, the convergence of HB-based fixed-point algorithm is achieved for a range of reduced velocity. To begin with, the HB solver is first assessed for a periodic unsteady flow around a stationary circular cylinder. A freely vibrating circular cylinder is then adopted for the reduced-order computation of VIV at low Reynolds numbers of Re=100 and 180 with one- and two-degrees-of-freedom. The coupled VIV dynamics and the frequency lock-in phenomenon are accurately captured. The results show that the HB solver is able to predict the amplitude of vibration, frequency and forces comparable to its time domain counterpart, while providing a significant reduction with regard to overall computational cost. The proposed new scheme is then demonstrated for a fully-coupled three dimensional (3D) analysis of a linear-elastic riser section undergoing vortex-induced vibration in the lock-in range. The results reveal the 3D effects through isosurfaces of streamwise vorticity blobs distributed over the span of flexible riser section. In comparison to time domain results, the 3D flow-structure interactions are accurately predicted while providing a similar speed up rate that of 2D simulations. This further corroborates that the HB solver can be extended to 3D flow-structure dynamics without compromising efficiency and accuracy. {\copyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

An analytical procedure is developed for modelling the dynamic behavior of beams and blades coated with a plasma-sprayed iron--chromium-based coating. The stress- or strain-dependent damping capability of the coating material is evaluated experimentally and further quantified with a distribution function proposed by Smith and Birchak (1968 Journal of Applied Physics39, 2311--2316 [1], 1969 Journal of Applied Physics40, 5174--5178 [2]). The equation of motion and associated boundary conditions are derived for uniformly coated beams. The resulting equation of motion is solved for beams using a closed-form procedure. To validate the closed-form solutions and further investigate the effects of a thin coating on high-frequency chordwise bending modes or stripe modes (the terminology widely used by the turbine engine industry) of the vibrations of a curved blade, a three-dimensional finite element approach is used, which allows one to systematically determine the stress-dependent damping properties. The finite element results show that a thin magnetomechanical coating layer can make a significant contribution to the damping and reduction of vibratory or alternating stresses at various high-frequency vibration stripe modes.},

Governing equations of the probability for the response-amplitude perturbations (a local transition) within an attraction domain and a jump between different attraction domains (a global transition) are derived under the assumption of a stationary Markov condition.

 abstract = {This work investigates a self-tuning resonator composed of a slender clamped--clamped steel beam and a freely movable slider. The clamped--clamped beam exhibits hardening nonlinearity when it vibrates in large amplitude, providing a broad bandwidth of dynamic response. The moving slider changes the mass distribution of the whole structure, and provides a passive self-tuning approach for capturing the high-energy orbit of the structure. In the case without inclination, adequate inertial force that mainly depends on the vibration amplitude of the beam and the position of the slider can drive the slider to move from the side toward the centre of the beam. This movement amplifies the beam response when the excitation frequency is below 37~Hz in our prototyped device. In the multi-orbit frequency range (28--37~Hz), the self-tuning and magnification of beam response can be achieved when the slider is initially placed in an appropriate position on the beam. Once the beam is disturbed, however, the desired response in the high-energy orbit can be lost easily and cannot be reacquired without external assistance. In an improved design with a small inclination, the introduced small gravitational component enables the slider to move from the higher side toward the lower side when the beam amplitude is small. This property sacrifices the less efficient self-tuning region below 25~Hz, but can enable the beam to acquire and maintain the high-energy orbit response in the multi-orbit frequency range (28--39~Hz), which is resistant to disturbance. The proposed resonator in this paper not only broadens the frequency bandwidth of dynamic response, but also enables capture and maintenance of the high-energy orbit in a completely passive way.

When the amplitude and curvature of the beam at the slider location are large enough, the slider could be driven to move from the side towards the centre and stop around the centre. The slider's movement, in turn, changes the beam-slider structure's mass distribution that shifts the frequency response functions to the lower frequency range. During this interaction between the beam and slider, the high energy orbit could be captured with amplified vibration response.

 abstract = {Underplatform dampers are widely used in turbomachinery to mitigate structural vibrations by means of friction dissipation at the interfaces. The modelling of such friction dissipation is challenging because of the high variability observed in experimental measurements of contact parameters. Although this variability is not commonly accounted for in state-of-the-art numerical solvers, probabilistic approaches can be implemented to include it in dynamics simulations in order to significantly improve the estimation of the damper performance. The aim of this work is to obtain uncertainty bands in the dynamic response of turbine blades equipped with dampers by including the variability observed in interfacial contact parameters. This variability is experimentally quantified from a friction rig and used to generate uncertainty bands by combining a deterministic state-of-the-art numerical solver with stochastic Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) models. The bands thus obtained are validated against experimental data from an underplatform damper test rig. In addition, the PCEs are also employed to perform a variance-based global sensitivity analysis to quantify the influence of contact parameters on the variation in the nonlinear dynamic response via Sobol indices. The analysis highlights that the influence of each contact parameter in vibration amplitude strongly varies over the frequency range, and that Sobol indices can be effectively used to analyse uncertainties associated to structures with friction interfaces providing valuable insights into the physics of such complex nonlinear systems.},

 abstract = {The concept of nonlinear modes has been proved useful to interpret a wide class of nonlinear phenomena in mechanical systems such as energy dependent vibrations and internal resonance. Although this concept was successfully applied to some small scale structures, the computational cost for large-scale nonlinear models remains an important issue that prevents the wider spread of this nonlinear analysis tool in industry. To address this challenge, in this paper, we describe an advanced adaptive reduced order modelling (ROM) technique to compute the damped nonlinear modes for a large scale nonlinear system with frictional interfaces. The principle of this new ROM technique is that it enables the nonlinear modes to be computed in a reduced self-adaptive modal subspace while maintaining similar accuracy to classical reduction techniques. The size of such self-adaptive subspace is only proportional to the number of active slipping nodes in friction interfaces leading to a significant reduction of computing time especially when the friction interface is in a micro-slip motion. The procedure of implementing this adaptive ROM into the computation of steady state damped nonlinear mode is presented. The case of an industrial-scale fan blade system with dovetail joints in aero-engines is studied. Damped nonlinear normal modes based on the concept of extended periodic motion is successfully calculated using the proposed adaptive ROM technique. A comparison between adaptive ROM with the classical Craig-Bampton method highlights the capability of the adaptive ROM to accurately capture the resonant frequency and modal damping ratio while achieving a speedup up to 120. The obtained nonlinear modes from adaptive ROM are also validated by comparing its synthesized forced response against the directly computed ones using Craig-Bampton (CB) method. The study further shows the reconstructed forced frequency response from damped nonlinear modes are able to accurately capture reference forced response over a wide range of excitation levels with the maximum error less than 1{\%} at nearly zero computational cost.},

The identification of the major contributors to this lack of correlation is an indispensable first step to actual modification and improvement of modeling processes and tools. The study focuses on simple configurations: panels with lap and butt joints fastened with HI-LITE fasteners or rivets. Impact hammer tests were used to measure their natural frequencies, mode shapes, and damping ratios. The results were compared with numerical predictions based on current industry modeling practices. Next, shaker tests were used to investigate the nonlinear behavior of the fastened connections. The most significant discrepancy between measurements and predictions were due to modeling idealizations of the joints. Nonlinearities were also important, though to a lesser extent.},

A Duffing oscillator is widely used as an archetypical model of mechanical resonators with nonlinear elastic behavior. In contrast, nonlinear dissipation effects in micromechanical oscillators are often overlooked. In this work, we consider a doubly clamped micromechanical beam oscillator, which exhibits nonlinearity in both elastic and dissipative properties. The dynamics of the oscillator is measured in both frequency and time domains and compared to theoretical predictions based on a Duffing-like model with nonlinear dissipation. We especially focus on the behavior of the system near bifurcation points. The results show that nonlinear dissipation can have a significant impact on the dynamics of micromechanical systems. To account for the results, we have developed a continuous model of a geometrically nonlinear beam-string with a linear Voigt--Kelvin viscoelastic constitutive law, which shows a relation between linear and nonlinear damping. However, the experimental results suggest that this model alone cannot fully account for all the experimentally observed nonlinear dissipation, and that additional nonlinear dissipative processes exist in our devices.},

Laser Doppler Velocimetry, with its scanning variances, is generally accepted as the reference technology in measuring vibration patterns with high spatial definition. Nonetheless, one must be reminded of the noise shown in the raw signal of some experiments, which poses issues in proficiently exploiting the added data in a fruitful model updating procedure. Instead, native full field measuring technologies, like Hi-Speed DIC and dynamic ESPI, have recently shown intrinsic smoother data fields: their image-based nature and evaluation algorithms of experimental quantities promise advances on model optimisations, having to struggle less against a reduced uncertainty in the references. In this work, a comparison is made by means of all the cited challenging technologies on the same broad frequency band vibration measurement problem, with different spatial resolutions and quality of the measured patterns, in the framework of established procedures for model updating of dynamically excited structures. The identification of EMA models highlights the increasing quality of shapes that can be obtained from native full field high resolution instruments, against that of SLDV (some time unexpectedly poor, as tested). A comparative paradigm is recalled to precisely match the competing measurement technologies on the same physical point of a common grid: model updating results are therefore thoroughly compared between scanning and native full field technologies, with comments and details on the test rig, on the advantages and drawbacks of the approaches. The model updating procedures show a fruitful impact of the native full field technologies in the form of an increased consistency on eigenshapes used to tune the virtual structural model.},

The nonlinear modal identification of a four-storey steel frame is presented in this paper including both the experimental and the analytical aspects. The first two bending modes of the frame were experimentally isolated by a single-point mono-harmonic excitation. The subsequent free decay vibration was measured and used for identification purposes. An original filtering procedure was developed in order to overcome the drawbacks of the common band-pass filters and to enhance the accuracy of the signals. The nonparametric identification of the structure was carried out through an expeditious procedure based on the analysis of the evolution of the apparent frequency and equivalent viscous damping coefficient as a function of the apparent amplitude of the free decay cycles. The results of this identification reveal that the structure is weakly nonlinear in stiffness and strongly nonlinear in damping, while the mode shapes remain linear within the range of measurements. Asymptotic nonlinear laws defined in the modal space where proposed to model both the stiffness and the damping. This is another original contribution in this paper. The proposed nonlinear model was fitted to the experimental data in the time domain. Results were excellent with fitting errors three orders of magnitude lower than those of a pure linear model.},

measurement by strain gauge tests and structural high cyclic

experimental results of studying the effects of HPC stator

angular positions in gas turbine engines on the circumferential

distribution pattern of vibratory stress. Strain gauge tests were

done on a stator with cantilevered vanes. Each vane had a strain

gauge deployed at the same location. The stator was clocked at

two different angular positions in gas turbine engines during

strain gauge tests.



The experimental results show that more than one resonant

peak occurred for a given vibratory mode and engine order

resonance. The frequencies of resonant peaks were close to one

another. The circumferential distribution of maximum vibratory

stress (i.e., the maximum magnitude of these resonant peaks)

with respect to the stator itself has a similar pattern at the two

different angular positions. This clearly indicates the

distribution pattern does not follow the gas-path aerodynamic

pressure, but follows the stator angular positions. The

frequency of the maximum vibratory stress was found to vary

from sector to sector instead of from vane to vane; the vanes in

each sector have a same frequency.



Mistuning analysis was performed on the HPC stator to

illustrate a number of resonant peaks and the sector-to-sector

frequency variation of the maximum vibratory stress. The

approach of ``subset of nominal system modes'' (SNM) [1,2]

distributions of stator vanes obtained by bench frequency

response tests were used as input data. At the end, one might

conclude that the high circumferential variation of vibratory

Recently, SMA wires have also become commercially available for the design of smart composite structures because SMA wires with a small diameter can be easily produced. In this work, two types of SMA-based composites are presented for investigating the vibration characteristics. First, laminated composite plates containing unidirectional fine SMA wires are fabricated. By measuring the vibration mode of a clamped cantilever, the influence of both SMA arrangement and temperature on the vibration characteristics is made clear. Next, laminated composite plates with embedded woven SMA layer are fabricated. The stiffness tuning capability is evaluated by impact vibration tests with different temperatures. It is found that the stiffness tuning capability may be improved by increasing the volume fraction of SMAs and by controlling accurately the internal stress according to the phase transformation temperature of SMAs from martensite to austenite. The theoretical prediction on the natural frequency considering the SMAs behavior and laminated structures is proposed and their results agree reasonably with experimental ones. {\copyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

 abstract = {Compliant contact force modeling has become a popular approach for contact and impact dynamics simulation of multibody systems. In this area, the nonlinear viscoelastic contact force model developed by Hunt and Crossley (1975, ``Coefficient of Restitution Interpreted as Damping in Vibroimpact,'' ASME J. Appl. Mech., 42, pp. 440--445) over 2 decades ago has become a trademark with applications of the model ranging from intermittent dynamics of mechanisms to engagement dynamics of helicopter rotors and implementations in commercial multibody dynamics simulators. The distinguishing feature of this model is that it employs a nonlinear damping term to model the energy dissipation during contact, where the damping coefficient is related to the coefficient of restitution. Since its conception, the model prompted several investigations on how to evaluate the damping coefficient, in turn resulting in several variations on the original Hunt--Crossley model. In this paper, the authors aim to experimentally validate the Hunt--Crossley type of contact force models and furthermore to compare the experimental results to the model predictions obtained with different values of the damping coefficient. This paper reports our findings from the sphere to flat impact experiments, conducted for a range of initial impacting velocities using a pendulum test rig. The unique features of this investigation are that the impact forces are deduced from the acceleration measurements of the impacting body, and the experiments are conducted with specimens of different yield strengths. The experimental forces are compared with those predicted from the contact dynamics simulation of the experimental scenario. The experiments, in addition to generating novel impact measurements, provide a number of insights into both the study of impact and the impact response.},

 abstract = {We study the in-plane damped oscillations of a finite lattice of particles coupled by linear springs under distributed harmonic excitation. Strong nonlinearity in this system is generated by geometric effects due to the in-plane stretching of the coupling spring elements. The lattice has a finite number of nonlinear transverse standing waves (termed nonlinear normal modes -- NNMs), and an equal number of axial linear modes which are nonlinearly coupled to the transverse ones. Nonlinear interactions between the transverse and axial modes under harmonic excitation give rise to unexpected and extreme nonlinear energy exchanges in the lattice. In particular, we directly excite a transverse NNM by harmonic forcing (causing simulataneous indirect excitation of a corresponding axial linear mode due to nonlinear coupling), and identify three energy transfer mechanisms in the lattice. First, we detect the stable response of the directly excited transverse NNM (despite its instability in the absence of forcing), with simultaneous stability of the indirectly excited axial linear mode. Second, by changing the system and forcing parameters we report extreme nonlinear ``energy explosions,'' whereby, after an initial regime of stability, the directly excited transverse NNM loses stability, leading to abrupt excitation of all transverse and axial modes of the lattice, at all possible wave numbers. This strong instability is triggered by the parametric instability of an indirectly excited axial mode which builds energy until the explosion. This is proved through theoretical analysis. Finally, in other parameter ranges we report intermittent, intense energy transfers from the directly excited transverse NNM to a small set of transverse NNMs with smaller wavelengths, and from the indirectly excited axial mode to a small set of axial modes, but with larger wavelengths. These intermittent energy transfers resemble energy cascades occurring in turbulent flows. Our results show that nonlinear mechanical systems can support extreme energy transfer phenomena, with features resembling ``mechanical turbulence''.},

The model couples a finite difference model based on the Rayleigh's beam theory with a theoretical contact model, named refined Stronge's model. The elastic--plastic transient impact responses of the beam and the wave propagation are solved by the finite difference model. The local elastic--plastic contact behavior is analyzed by the refined Stronge's model. The presented model is verified by the experiments. The comparisons of the numerical results with the experimental results show that the presented model is valid and can predict accurately the transient impact response and impact-induced wave propagation. The comparison of the calculating efficiency with the 3D finite element model shows that the presented model is highly efficient and suitable for parametric study. The effects of the various impact parameters, such as impactor mass, velocity, plasticity and impact location on the impact response, the energy loss and the coefficient of restitution are investigated. It has been found that the impact-induced wave propagation influences significantly the impact force response, the contact time, the energy loss and the coefficient of restitution. A jumping phenomenon of the energy loss and the Newton coefficient of restitution has been found, and it is resulted from the impact-induced wave propagation. The presented model appears to be suitable and convenient for the impact response analysis of elastic--plastic beam, especially for the study of impact-induced wave effects.},

 abstract = {An essentially nonlinear piezoelectric shunt circuit is proposed for the practical realization of nonlinear energy sink, and then applied to a mistuned bladed disk for blade vibration reduction. First, the global dynamics of a single degree-of-freedom linear mechanical oscillator, coupled to an essentially nonlinear shunted piezoelectric attachment, is studied. Under certain conditions, the nonlinear targeted energy transfer, i.e. a fast, passive energy transfer from the mechanical oscillator to the nonlinear attachment is observed. A numerical method, referred to as the variable-coefficient harmonic balance method, is developed to calculate quasi-periodic responses arising in the electromechanical system under harmonic forcing. Characterized by the nonexistence of a resonance frequency, the essentially nonlinear shunt circuit is able to work robustly over a broad frequency band with a smaller inductance requirement compared with the linear resonant shunt circuit. The application of piezoelectric shunt damping to simplified blade-disk structures is then taken into consideration. Shunted piezoelectrics are attached onto the disk surface in our damping strategy in order to reduce blade vibrations. Essential nonlinearity is also introduced into the piezoelectric shunted bladed disk system. Since the piezoelectric-based nonlinear energy sink is not a priori tuned to any specific frequency, a sound damping performance is achieved when blades become inevitably mistuned.},

@article{Ziegler.2006,
 abstract = {Gear hammering in diesel engines is a well-known phenomenon in geared drives, exhibiting not only noise but also influencing the performance and durability of diesel engines. Gear hammering is characterised by flanks in contact that lift off and cause impacts when the contact reestablishes, which induces high, sharp dynamic loads. The knowledge of these contact forces is very important for the design of gears. Since contact forces in meshing gears are extremely difficult and expensive to measure, the simulation of these forces plays an important role. Nowadays, these contact simulations are usually carried out within overall models of entire engines using commercial multibody programs that provide submodels for gear contacts, usually based on rigid-body models. However, to reduce inertia effects, gears in geartrains are often designed with very thin bodies, whose elastic compliance influences the contact behaviour to a large extent. For a closer insight into the dynamic behaviour, and especially the influence of thin gear bodies during impact, a typical gear pairing is selected and impacts between one tooth pair are investigated for different boundary and initial conditions with three different models. Besides a multibody model, similar to those used in commercial multibody programs, a fully nonlinear finite-element model and a modally reduced model in combination with a local force law is used. The results of the different approaches are benchmarked in terms of accuracy and numerical effort.},

 abstract = {The dynamic forced response of a two-degrees-of-freedom model of an unbalanced overhung rotor with clearance and symmetric piecewise-linear stiffness is examined in the time domain. The stiffness nonlinearity is representative of the contact between the rotor and a concentric stator ring. This rubbing interaction comes as a result of the rotor transient motion initiated by the sudden application of a static unbalance, such as in a blade loss scenario. The focus of this study is on the range of rotor speeds above resonance, where the contact between rotor and stator is characterised by a ``bouncing'' or intermittent type of behaviour. Brute-force numerical bifurcation analysis on the long-term forced response revealed ranges of rotation frequency for which there is bi-stability between non-impacting synchronous equilibrium and impacting sub-synchronous motion. It is found that, for sufficiently high levels of transient energy in the rotor, there exists the possibility for the solution to jump into a stable limit cycle characterised by three non-harmonically related frequencies, namely the synchronous response frequency and the forward and backward whirl frequencies. A simple relationship defining the point of synchronisation between these three components is proposed as an explanation to the region of bi-stability detected. The stiffening effect induced by the contact non-linearity enables this synchronisation to be maintained over a range of forcing frequencies rather than just at the single condition determined from the nominal whirl mode frequencies.},

 abstract = {Friction damping is one of the most exploited systems of passive control of the vibration of mechanical systems. In order to mitigate vibration of turbine blades, friction dampers are commonly included in the bladed disk design. A common type of blade-to-blade friction dampers are the so-called underplatform dampers (UPDs); these are metal devices placed under the blade platforms and held in contact with them by the centrifugal force acting during rotation. The effectiveness of UPDs to dissipate energy by friction and reduce vibration amplitude depends mostly on the damper geometry and material and on the static loads pressing the damper against the blade platforms. The common procedure used to estimate the static loads acting on UPDs consists in decoupling the static and the dynamic balance of the damper. A preliminary static analysis of the contact is performed in order to compute the static pressure distribution over the damper/blade interfaces, assuming that it does not change when vibration occurs. In this paper a coupled approach is proposed. The static and the dynamic displacements of blade and UPD are coupled together during the forced response calculation. Both the primary structure (the bladed disk) and the secondary structure (the damper) are modeled by finite elements and linked together by contact elements, allowing for stick, slip and lift off states, placed between each pair of contact nodes, by using a refined version of the state-of-the-art friction contact model. In order to model accurately the blade/damper contact with a large number of contact nodes without increasing proportionally the size of the set of nonlinear equations to be solved, damper and blade dynamics are modeled by linear superposition of a truncated series of normal modes. The proposed method is applied to a bladed disk under cyclic symmetric boundary conditions in order to show the capabilities of the method compared to the classical decoupled approaches.},

 abstract = {Real applications in structural mechanics where the dynamic behavior is linear are rare. Usually, structures are made of components assembled together by means of joints whose behavior maybe highly nonlinear. Depending on the amount of excitation, joints can dramatically change the dynamic behavior of the whole system, and the modeling of this type of constraint is therefore crucial for a correct prediction of the amount of vibration. The solution of the nonlinear equilibrium equations by means of the Harmonic Balance Method (HBM) is widely accepted as an effective approach to calculate the steady-state forced response in the frequency domain, in spite of Direct Time Integration (DTI). The state-of-the-art contact element used to model the friction forces at the joint interfaces is a node-to-node contact element, where the local contact compliance is modeled by means of linear springs and Coulomb's law is used to govern the friction phenomena. In the literature, when the HBM is applied to vibrating systems with joint interfaces and the state-of-the-art contact model is used, an uncoupled approach is mostly employed: the static governing equations are solved in advance to compute the pre-stress effects and then the dynamic governing equations are solved to predict the vibration amplitude of the system. As a result, the HBM steady-state solution may lead to a poor correlation with the DTI solution, where static and dynamic loads are accounted for simultaneously. In this paper, the HBM performances are investigated by comparing the uncoupled approach to a fully coupled static/dynamic approach. In order to highlight the main differences between the two approaches, a lumped parameter system, characterized by a single friction contact, is considered in order to show the different levels of accuracy that the proposed approaches can provide for different configurations. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

 abstract = {In turbomachinery, blade crack detection methods are beneficial for condition-based maintenance and for reducing the risk of catastrophic failures due to high cycle fatigue of bladed disks. A crack can be more easily detected in a perfectly tuned bladed disk (i.e., with identical blades and sectors). That is because the crack causes mode distortion and possibly response localization. Unfortunately, perfectly tuned bladed disks are an idealization since small blade mistuning is unavoidable and it can also cause mode distortion and response localization in bladed disks. A detection method has been recently developed to detect the presence of a crack in a mistuned bladed disk and to identify which blade is cracked. The method requires multi-point measurements of all blades (e.g., obtained by using tip-timing techniques) and is based on the observation/assumption that the dynamic response of a cracked bladed disk cannot be represented as a linear combination of modes of the tuned system. This paper introduces a method which uses a similar physical basis for detection, but requires fewer measurements, namely one measurement location per blade (e.g., obtained using tip-timing methods). The key idea is to focus on isolated modes (or isolated mode pairs) which are sensitive to the presence of a crack rather than on an entire mode family (with high modal density). The novel method also extracts spatially correlated vectors from the nonlinear (forced response) measurement data of the cracked bladed disk to be used for crack identification.},

 abstract = {The dynamic analysis of structures with localized nonlinearities, such as intermittent contacts of cracked structures, is a computationally demanding task because of the large size of the models involved. Thus, high-resolution finite element models are often reduced using a variety of specialized techniques which exploit spatial coherences in the dynamics. In addition, when a steady-state forced response analysis is performed, direct time integration can be replaced with multi-harmonic balance methods. Recently, a technique based on bi-linear normal modes has been successfully applied to piecewise-linear oscillators. The key idea of that approach is to represent the spatial coherences in the system dynamics with two sets of normal modes with special boundary conditions, referred to as bi-linear modes. In this paper, the bi-linear modal representation is extended to the case of intermittent contacts with friction. Furthermore, a novel reduced order modeling method is developed for the 0th order harmonic used in multi-harmonic balance methods.

@article{Zucca.2016,
 abstract = {Assembled structures are characterized by contact interfaces that introduce a local non-linearity and affect the dynamics of the assembly in terms of resonance frequencies and vibration levels. To assess the forced response levels of the assemblies during the design, nonlinear dynamic analyses are performed and, in order to reduce the computation time, spatial and temporal reductions of the governing equations must be used. A classical way to achieve temporal reduction is to implement the harmonic balance method to turn the time-domain differential governing equations into frequency-domain algebraic equations. Due to the local nature of contact interfaces, which usually involve a subset of degrees of freedom (dofs) of the structure, a common strategy to achieve spatial reduction is to use component mode synthesis (CMS), by retaining the contact dofs as master dofs. In this paper, a recent CMS approach, named dual Craig--Bampton method (Rixen in J Comput Appl Math, 2004. doi:                10.1016/j.cam.2003.12.014                              ), is applied to the nonlinear forced response of structures with contact interfaces. The spectral orthogonality of the two subsets of mode shapes used as a projection basis is exploited to write a set of algebraic equations of the contact dofs in the frequency domain, with no need to compute the reduced matrices of the system. Different formulations of the governing equations are proposed for different configurations (i.e., outer contacts, inner contacts and structures with floating components), and two academic numerical test cases are used to demonstrate the method.},

 abstract = {Conewise (piecewise) linear, non-gyroscopic and gyroscopic autonomous systems are studied in detail. First, the general properties of such systems are examined. Then the non-linear real and complex modes are obtained for both non-gyroscopic and gyroscopic cases, by means of analytical or numerical tools. Several interesting characteristics of non-linear modes are found and compared to those of linear modes. Accurate analytical estimates of non-linear mode periods are formulated for both non-gyroscopic and gyroscopic systems. The validity of such estimates is discussed in relation to a non-linear mode bifurcation phenomenon, which is located by using both characteristic multipliers and Poincar{\'e} mapping.},

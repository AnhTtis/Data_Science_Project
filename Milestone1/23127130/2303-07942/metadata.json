    "abstract": "Understanding the interaction of intense, femtosecond X-ray pulses with heavy atoms is crucial for gaining insights into the structure and dynamics of matter. One key aspect of nonlinear light-matter interaction was, so far, not studied systematically at free-electron lasers -- its dependence on the photon energy. Using resonant ion spectroscopy, we map out the transient electronic structures occurring during the complex charge-up pathways. Massively hollow atoms featuring up to six simultaneous core holes determine the spectra at specific photon energies and charge states. We also illustrate how the influence of different X-ray pulse parameters that are usually intertwined can be partially disentangled. The extraction of resonance spectra is facilitated by the fact that the ion yields become independent of the peak fluence beyond a saturation point. Our study lays the groundwork for novel spectroscopies of transient atomic species in exotic, multiple-core-hole states that have not been explored previously.",

Decrypting the charge and fragmentation dynamics of nucleobases, the smallest units of a macro-biomolecule, contributes to a bottom-up understanding of the damage via cascades of phenomena following x-ray exposure. We investigate experimentally and by numerical simulations the ultrafast radiation damage induced on a nucleobase analogue (5-iodouracil) by an ultrashort (10 fs) high-intensity radiation pulse generated by XFEL at SPring-8 Angstrom Compact free electron Laser (SACLA). The present study elucidates a plausible underlying radiosensitizing mechanism of 5-iodouracil. This mechanism is independent of the exact composition of 5-iodouracil and thus relevant to other such radiosensitizers. Furthermore, we found that despite a rapid increase of the net molecular charge in the presence of iodine, and of the ultrafast release of hydrogen, the other atoms are almost frozen within the 10-fs duration of the exposure. This validates singleshot molecular imaging as a consistent approach, provided the radiation pulse used is brief enough.},

	abstract = {X-ray free-electron lasers enable the investigation of the structure and dynamics of diverse systems, including atoms, molecules, nanocrystals and single bioparticles, under extreme conditions. Many imaging applications that target biological systems and complex materials use hard X-ray pulses with extremely high peak intensities (exceeding 1020 watts per square centimetre). However, fundamental investigations have focused mainly on the individual response of atoms and small molecules using soft X-rays with much lower intensities. Studies with intense X-ray pulses have shown that irradiated atoms reach a very high degree of ionization, owing to multiphoton absorption, which in a heteronuclear molecular system occurs predominantly locally on a heavy atom (provided that the absorption cross-section of the heavy atom is considerably larger than those of its neighbours) and is followed by efficient redistribution of the induced charge. In serial femtosecond crystallography of biological objects—an application of X-ray free-electron lasers that greatly enhances our ability to determine protein structure—the ionization of heavy atoms increases the local radiation damage that is seen in the diffraction patterns of these objects and has been suggested as a way of phasing the diffraction data. On the basis of experiments using either soft or less-intense hard X-rays, it is thought that the induced charge and associated radiation damage of atoms in polyatomic molecules can be inferred from the charge that is induced in an isolated atom under otherwise comparable irradiation conditions. Here we show that the femtosecond response of small polyatomic molecules that contain one heavy atom to ultra-intense (with intensities approaching 1020 watts per square centimetre), hard (with photon energies of 8.3 kiloelectronvolts) X-ray pulses is qualitatively different: our experimental and modelling results establish that, under these conditions, the ionization of a molecule is considerably enhanced compared to that of an individual heavy atom with the same absorption cross-section. This enhancement is driven by ultrafast charge transfer within the molecule, which refills the core holes that are created in the heavy atom, providing further targets for inner-shell ionization and resulting in the emission of more than 50 electrons during the X-ray pulse. Our results demonstrate that efficient modelling of X-ray-driven processes in complex systems at ultrahigh intensities is feasible.},

Research areas such as warm dense matter physics and coherent X-ray imaging take advantage of the unprecedentedly high intensities of XFELs. A single XFEL pulse can induce very complex dynamics within matter initiated by core-hole photoionization. Owing to this complexity, theoretical modeling revealing details of the excitation and relaxation of irradiated matter is important for the correct interpretation of the measurements and for proposing new experiments. XMDYN is a computer simulation tool developed for modeling dynamics of matter induced by high-intensity X-rays. It utilizes atomic data calculated by the ab initio XATOM toolkit.

The efﬁciency saturates above 3000 eV, reaching a value of 52.3(3)\%, consistent with the MCPs geometry. The behaviour of the efﬁciency with respect to the ion kinetic energy is ascribed to the electronic threshold, through a detailed analysis of the collected charge distribution. The efﬁciency dependence on the ions impact position and incidence angle has also been studied. A loss of efﬁciency has been observed in the vicinity of the MCPs bias angle, which can be avoided if a large post-acceleration ﬁeld is created in front of the MCPs.

We report on the performance of the European XFEL accelerator with up to 5,000 electron bunches per second and demonstrating a full energy of 17.5 GeV. Feedback mechanisms enable stabilization of the electron beam delivery at the FEL undulator in space and time. The measured FEL gain curve at 9.3 keV is in good agreement with predictions for saturated FEL radiation. Hard X-ray lasing was achieved between 7 keV and 14 keV with pulse energies of up to 2.0 mJ.

	abstract = {Here, we report on the nonlinear ionization of argon atoms in the short wavelength regime using ultraintense x rays from the European XFEL. After sequential multiphoton ionization, high charge states are obtained. For photon energies that are insufficient to directly ionize a 1s electron, a different mechanism is required to obtain ionization to Ar17+. We propose this occurs through a two-color process where the second harmonic of the FEL pulse resonantly excites the system via a 1s→2p transition followed by ionization by the fundamental FEL pulse, which is a type of x-ray resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI). This resonant phenomenon occurs not only for Ar16+, but also through lower charge states, where multiple ionization competes with decay lifetimes, making x-ray REMPI distinctive from conventional REMPI. With the aid of state-of-the-art theoretical calculations, we explain the effects of x-ray REMPI on the relevant ion yields and spectral profile.},

	abstract = {X-ray free-electron lasers (FELs) are promising tools for structural determination of macromolecules via coherent x-ray scattering. During ultrashort and ultraintense x-ray pulses with an atomic-scale wavelength, samples are subject to radiation damage and possibly become highly ionized, which may influence the quality of x-ray scattering patterns. We develop a toolkit to treat detailed ionization, relaxation, and scattering dynamics for an atom within a consistent theoretical framework. The coherent x-ray scattering problem including radiation damage is investigated as a function of x-ray FEL parameters such as pulse length, fluence, and photon energy. We find that the x-ray scattering intensity saturates at a fluence of {\textasciitilde}107 photon/Å2 per pulse but can be maximized by using a pulse duration much shorter than the time scales involved in the relaxation of the inner-shell vacancy states created. Under these conditions, both inner-shell electrons in a carbon atom are removed, and the resulting hollow atom gives rise to a scattering pattern with little loss of quality for a spatial resolution {\textgreater}1 Å. Our numerical results predict that in order to scatter from a carbon atom 0.1 photon per x-ray pulse, within a spatial resolution of 1.7 Å, a fluence of 1×107 photons/Å2 per pulse is required at a pulse length of 1 fs and a photon energy of 12 keV. By using a pulse length of a few hundred attoseconds, one can suppress even secondary ionization processes in extended systems. The present results suggest that high-brightness attosecond x-ray FELs would be ideal for single-shot imaging of individual macromolecules.},

A kinetic model is employed to determine the probability of inner-shell double hole formation in para-aminophenol exposed to an intense, 1 fs x-ray pulse.

Using an analytical rate equation model we show that comparing these magnitudes by introducing reduced ionization yields leads to clustering curves in the sequential case and spreading in the direct one when laser focus averaging is taken into account. Applying this insight to the experimental data, we are able to assess that the sequential process is responsible for ionization of neon up to Ne5+ induced by short, intense and coherent soft XUV light provided by free-electron laser sources.},

	abstract = {Following structural dynamics in real time is a fundamental goal towards a better understanding of chemical reactions. Recording snapshots of individual molecules with ultrashort exposure times is a key ingredient towards this goal, as atoms move on femtosecond (10−15 s) timescales. For condensed-phase samples, ultrafast, atomically resolved structure determination has been demonstrated using X-ray and electron diffraction. Pioneering experiments have also started addressing gaseous samples. However, they face the problem of low target densities, low scattering cross sections and random spatial orientation of the molecules. Therefore, obtaining images of entire, isolated molecules capturing all constituents, including hydrogen atoms, remains challenging. Here we demonstrate that intense femtosecond pulses from an X-ray free-electron laser trigger rapid and complete Coulomb explosions of 2-iodopyridine and 2-iodopyrazine molecules. We obtain intriguingly clear momentum images depicting ten or eleven atoms, including all the hydrogens, and thus overcome a so-far impregnable barrier for complete Coulomb explosion imaging—its limitation on molecules consisting of three to five atoms. In combination with state-of-the-art multi-coincidence techniques and elaborate theoretical modelling, this allows tracing ultrafast hydrogen emission and obtaining information on the result of intramolecular electron rearrangement. Our work represents an important step towards imaging femtosecond chemistry via Coulomb explosion.},

	abstract = {Generally, the probability that a given atom in a material absorbs an X-ray photon in a single X-ray pulse is much less than unity for storage-ring-based X-ray sources, even for third-generation synchrotron radiation sources. This situation has changed dramatically with the arrival of X-ray free-electron lasers: In the micro-focus of an X-ray free-electron laser, saturation of X-ray photoabsorption is routinely achieved. The immediate consequence is that the overall behavior of matter under such extreme conditions is characterized by efﬁcient multiphoton absorption via a sequence of single-photon absorption events combined with inner-shell decay cascades and collisional ionization processes. In this way, unusual, highly excited states of matter are formed. Focusing on free atoms, this article provides a theoretical framework for the description of X-ray–matter interactions. The nature of X-ray multiphoton physics is explained, and the theory is compared with experimental data on atoms.},

One motivation for the development of such X-ray sources was the proposal to obtain structures of macromolecules, macromolecular complexes, and virus particles, without the need for crystallization, through diffraction measurements of single noncrystalline objects. Initial explorations of this idea and of outrunning radiation damage with femtosecond pulses led to the development of serial crystallography and the ability to obtain high-resolution structures of small crystals without the need for cryogenic cooling. This technique allows the understanding of conformational dynamics and enzymatics and the resolution of intermediate states in reactions over timescales of 100 fs to minutes. The promise of more photons per atom recorded in a diffraction pattern than electrons per atom contributing to an electron micrograph may enable diffraction measurements of single molecules, although challenges remain.},

By high-resolution electron spectroscopy, we map out the transient Rydberg resonances unraveling the details of the subsequent decay of the hollow atom. So far, ultra-short-lived electronic transients, which are often inaccessible by experiments, were mainly inferred from theory but are now addressed by nonlinear x-ray absorption.

	abstract = {The effects of ion energy, mass and composition on the detection efficiency of a microchannel plate (MCP) have been studied in detail, using a time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer. This spectrometer is used for static secondary ion mass spectrometry (static SIMS) although the data are relevant to any ion-detection system. A model is developed that shows how the efficiency falls with increased mass and decreased ion impact energy at the front of the MCP. At an impact energy of 20 keV, the efficiency for the detection of cationised PS oligomers of mass 10,000 amu is approximately 80\%, whereas at 5 keV it has fallen to ∼5\%. The model is extended to estimate the effect of ion composition on the detection efficiency. It was found that ions with a high hydrogen content have a lower efficiency than those that consist of a cluster of high atomic number atoms. The spread of detection efficiencies arising from both composition and mass may be reduced by increasing the ion impact energy. Therefore, up to a mass of 4000 amu, the spread for ions of 100\% observed for 5-keV ion impact energy is reduced to a negligible spread for ions of 20-keV impact energy, where the efficiency is approximately unity, independent of the composition. A simple method is provided to determine the correct voltage to operate the MCP for a given efficiency. This operating voltage should be determined for the highest mass ions in the required range. .

This photon-driven cycling of an inner-shell electron modifies the Auger decay process, as evidenced by line shape modification.

	abstract = {Diffraction-before-destruction imaging with single ultrashort X-ray pulses has the potential to visualise non-equilibrium processes, such as chemical reactions, at the nanoscale with sub-femtosecond resolution in the native environment without the need of crystallization. Here, a nanospecimen partially diffracts a single X-ray flash before sample damage occurs. The structural information of the sample can be reconstructed from the coherent X-ray interference image. State-of-art spatial resolution of such snapshots from individual heavy element nanoparticles is limited to a few nanometers. Further improvement of spatial resolution requires higher image brightness which is ultimately limited by bleaching effects of the sample. We compared snapshots from individual 100 nm Xe nanoparticles as a function of the X-ray pulse duration and incoming X-ray intensity in the vicinity of the Xe M-shell resonance. Surprisingly, images recorded with few femtosecond and sub-femtosecond pulses are up to 10 times brighter than the static linear model predicts. Our Monte-Carlo simulation and statistical analysis of the entire data set confirms these findings and attributes the effect to transient resonances. Our simulation suggests that ultrafast form factor changes during the exposure can increase the brightness of X-ray images by several orders of magnitude. Our study guides the way towards imaging with unprecedented combination of spatial and temporal resolution at the nanoscale.},

	abstract = {The idea of using ultrashort X-ray pulses to obtain images of single proteins frozen in time has fascinated and inspired many. It was one of the arguments for building X-ray free-electron lasers. According to theory1, the extremely intense pulses provide sufficient signal to dispense with using crystals as an amplifier, and the ultrashort pulse duration permits capturing the diffraction data before the sample inevitably explodes2. This was first demonstrated on biological samples a decade ago on the giant mimivirus3. Since then a large collaboration4 has been pushing the limit of the smallest sample that can be imaged5,6. The ability to capture snapshots on the timescale of atomic vibrations, while keeping the sample at room temperature, may allow probing the entire conformational phase space of macromolecules. Here we show the first observation of an X-ray diffraction pattern from a single protein, that of Escherichia coli GroEL which at 14 nm in diameter7 is the smallest biological sample ever imaged by X-rays, and demonstrate that the concept of diffraction before destruction extends to single proteins. From the pattern, it is possible to determine the approximate orientation of the protein. Our experiment demonstrates the feasibility of ultrafast imaging of single proteins, opening the way to single-molecule time-resolved studies on the femtosecond timescale.},

	abstract = {NGC{\textasciitilde}5548 is an X-ray bright Seyfert 1 active galaxy. It exhibits a variety of spectroscopic features in the soft X-ray band, including in particular the absorption by the AGN outflows of a broad range of ionization states, with column densities up to 1E27 /m{\textasciicircum}2, and having speeds up to several thousand kilometers per second. The known emission features are in broad agreement with photoionized X-ray narrow and broad emission line models. We report on an X-ray spectroscopic study using 1.1 Ms XMM-Newton and 0.9 Ms Chandra grating observations of NGC 5548 spanning two decades. The aim is to search and characterize any potential spectroscopic features in addition to the known primary spectral components that are already modeled in high precision. We detect a weak unidentified excess emission feature at 18.4 Angstrom (18.1 Angstrom in the restframe). The feature is seen at \&gt;5 sigma statistical significance taking into account the look elsewhere effect. No known instrumental issues, atomic transitions, and astrophysical effects can explain this excess. The observed intensity of the possible feature seems to anti-correlate in time with the hardness ratio of the source. However, the variability might not be intrinsic, it might be caused by the time-variable obscuration by the outflows. An intriguing possibility is the line emission from charge exchange between a partially ionized outflow and a neutral layer in the same outflow, or in the close environment. Other possibilities, such as emission from a highly-ionized component with high outflowing speed, cannot be fully ruled out.},

              at 6 keV, is now available in X-ray astronomy. X-ray observations are particularly effective for plasma studies since major atomic transitions appear as spectral features in the X-ray band. High-resolution spectroscopy enables us to probe a wide variety of astrophysical plasmas, which are not obtainable from ground experiments, regarding their temperature, density, magnetic field, gravity, and velocity. In this review, we describe what are the X-ray emitting plasmas in the Universe, along with basic plasma diagnostics, and depict historical development of the techniques used for the X-ray spectroscopy. We outline the X-ray microcalorimeter instrument, soft X-ray spectrometer (SXS), onboard the ASTRO-H satellite. Despite the short lifetime of the satellite in orbit for about a month, observations with the SXS have shown the remarkable power of high-resolution spectroscopy in X-ray astronomy. Observed spectrum of the hot plasma in the core region of the Perseus cluster showed He-like Fe K-line to be clearly resolved into resonance, forbidden and intercombination lines for the first time. The line width indicates that the turbulent pressure amounts to only 4\% of the thermal pressure of the plasma. We also describe new findings and constraints obtained from the superb spectrum of the Perseus cluster, which all indicate a great potential of X-ray spectroscopy. The recovery of the spectroscopy science of ASTRO-H is aimed at with XRISM, a Japanese mission planned for launch in early 2020s. In further future, Athena will expand the rich science with its high sensitivity and spectral resolution in early 2030s.},

Two high-power regimes of the SASE3 undulator settings, i.e., linear and quadratic undulator tapering at saturation, were studied in detail and compared with the linear gain regime. The statistical analysis showed an exceptionally high degree of spatial coherence up to 90\% for the linear undulator tapering.

Tuning a short x-ray pulse to the initially closed resonant channel of the 1s−2p transition in singly ionized neon, the initially neutral neon target is valence ionized. Subsequently, the strong resonant x-ray field transfers an inner-shell electron to the created outer valence vacancy, thereby creating a core-excited state. The strong resonant coupling, giving rise to Rabi oscillations involving a core transition, results in a modification of the resonant Auger-electron spectral line profile. If the valence photoelectron remains unobserved, the system of the residual ion undergoing the resonant Auger decay can be treated by an open quantum system approach. The resonant Auger-electron spectral line shape is shown to be determined by an analog of the reduced density matrix that depends on two time arguments. The equations of motion of this reduced density matrix are derived and numerical results are presented, in support of the recent experimental verification [E. Kanter et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 233001 (2011)] of this nonlinear x-ray optical effect.},

Here, using a large-scale quantum master equation approach, we describe dynamical processes of practical open quantum systems driven by both coherent and stochastic interactions. As examples, two typical cases of light-matter interactions are studied. First, we investigate coherent dynamics of inner-shell electrons of a neon gas irradiated by a high-intensity X-ray laser along with vast number of decaying channels. In these single-photon dominated processes, we find that, due to coherence-induced Rabi oscillations and power broadening effects, the photon absorptions of a neon gas can be suppressed resulting in differences in ionization processes and final ion-stage distributions. Second, we take helium as an example of multiphoton and multichannel interference dominated electron dynamics, by investigating the transient absorption of an isolated attosecond pulse in the presence of a femtosecond infrared laser pulse.},

In general, x-ray multiphoton ionization dynamics of atoms have been described by time-dependent populations of the electronic configurations visited during the ionization dynamics, neglecting individual state-to-state transition rates and energies. Combining a state-resolved electronic-structure calculation, based on first-order many-body perturbation theory, with a Monte Carlo rate-equation method enables us to study state-resolved dynamics based on time-dependent state populations. Our results demonstrate that configuration-based and state-resolved calculations provide similar charge-state distributions, but the differences are visible when resonant excitations are involved, which are also reflected in calculated time-integrated electron and photon spectra. In addition, time-resolved spectra of ions, electrons, and photons are analyzed for different pulse durations to explore how frustrated absorption manifests itself during the ionization dynamics of neon atoms.},

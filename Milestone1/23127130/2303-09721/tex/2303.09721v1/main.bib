The realization of quantum networks composed of many nodes and channels requires new scientific capabilities for generating and characterizing quantum coherence and entanglement. Fundamental to this endeavour are quantum interconnects, which convert quantum states from one physical system to those of another in a reversible manner. Such quantum connectivity in networks can be achieved by the optical interactions of single photons and atoms, allowing the distribution of entanglement across the network and the teleportation of quantum states between nodes.},

abstract = {As indispensable as the internet has become in our daily lives, it still has many shortcomings, not least of which is that communication can be intercepted and information stolen. If, however, the internet attained the capability of transmitting quantum information—qubits—many of these security concerns would be addressed. Wehner et al. review what it will take to achieve this so-called quantum internet and propose stages of development that each correspond to increasingly powerful applications. Although a full-blown quantum internet, with functional quantum computers as nodes connected through quantum communication channels, is still some ways away, the first long-range quantum networks are already being planned. Science, this issue p. eaam9288 The internet—a vast network that enables simultaneous long-range classical communication—has had a revolutionary impact on our world. The vision of a quantum internet is to fundamentally enhance internet technology by enabling quantum communication between any two points on Earth. Such a quantum internet may operate in parallel to the internet that we have today and connect quantum processors in order to achieve capabilities that are provably impossible by using only classical means. Here, we propose stages of development toward a full-blown quantum internet and highlight experimental and theoretical progress needed to attain them.}}

abstract={To realize scalable quantum information networks in the near future, it will be important to develop techniques for storage and retrieval of light at the single photon level. Quantum interfaces between light and matter have been demonstrated before, but mainly with atomic gases, necessitating sophisticated schemes to trap the atoms. de Riedmatten et al. demonstrate a potentially more practical approach; coherent and reversible mapping of a light field with less than one photon per pulse onto an ensemble of about 107 atoms naturally trapped in a solid-state medium. The state of the light is mapped onto collective atomic excitations on an optical transition and stored for a pre-programmed time up of to one microsecond before being retrieved again. The authors also demonstrate that light can be stored in multiple temporal modes and believe that their multimode solid-state quantum memories are promising alternative to atomic gases.},

abstract={Long-duration quantum memories for photonic qubits are essential components for achieving long-distance quantum networks and repeaters. The mapping of optical states onto coherent spin-waves in rare earth ensembles is a particularly promising approach to quantum storage. However, it remains challenging to achieve long-duration storage at the quantum level due to read-out noise caused by the required spin-wave manipulation. In this work, we apply dynamical decoupling techniques and a small magnetic field to achieve the storage of six temporal modes for 20, 50, and 100{\thinspace}ms in a 151Eu3+:Y2SiO5 crystal, based on an atomic frequency comb memory, where each temporal mode contains around one photon on average. The quantum coherence of the memory is verified by storing two time-bin qubits for 20{\thinspace}ms, with an average memory output fidelity of F{\thinspace}={\thinspace}(85{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}2){\%} for an average number of photons per qubit of $\mu$in{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.92{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}0.04. The qubit analysis is done at the read-out of the memory, using a type of composite adiabatic read-out pulse we developed.},

We develop numerical simulations of quantum networks using different protocols, where the repeater hardware is modeled in terms of key performance parameters, such as photon generation rate and collection efficiency. These parameters are motivated by recent experimental demonstrations in quantum dots, trapped ions, and nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond. We find that a quantum-dot repeater with the newest protocol (‘MidpointSource’) delivers the highest entanglement-distribution rate for typical cases where there is low probability of establishing entanglement per transmission, and in some cases the rate is orders of magnitude higher than other schemes. Our simulation tools can be used to evaluate communication protocols as part of designing a large-scale quantum network.}

abstract={Quantum communication holds promise for absolutely secure transmission of secret messages and the faithful transfer of unknown quantum states. Photonic channels appear to be very attractive for the physical implementation of quantum communication. However, owing to losses and decoherence in the channel, the communication fidelity decreases exponentially with the channel length. Here we describe a scheme that allows the implementation of robust quantum communication over long lossy channels. The scheme involves laser manipulation of atomic ensembles, beam splitters, and single-photon detectors with moderate efficiencies, and is therefore compatible with current experimental technology. We show that the communication efficiency scales polynomially with the channel length, and hence the scheme should be operable over very long distances.},

At the core of this network lies the ability to generate and store entanglement at remote, interconnected quantum nodes2. Although various remote physical systems have been successfully entangled3--12, none of these realizations encompassed all of the requirements for network operation, such as compatibility with telecommunication (telecom) wavelengths and multimode operation. Here we report the demonstration of heralded entanglement between two spatially separated quantum nodes, where the entanglement is stored in multimode solid-state quantum memories. At each node a praseodymium-doped crystal13,14 stores a photon of a correlated pair15, with the second photon at telecom wavelengths. Entanglement between quantum memories placed in different laboratories is heralded by the detection of a telecom photon at a rate up to 1.4 kilohertz, and the entanglement is stored in the crystals for a pre-determined storage time up to 25 microseconds. We also show that the generated entanglement is robust against loss in the heralding path, and demonstrate temporally multiplexed operation, with 62　temporal modes. Our realization is extendable to entanglement over longer distances and provides a viable route towards field-deployed, multiplexed quantum repeaters based on solid-state resources.},

Rare-earth ion doped crystals are main candidates for highly multimode quantum memories, where time, frequency and spatial multiplexing can be exploited to store multiple modes. In this context the atomic frequency comb (AFC) quantum memory provides large temporal multimode capacity, which can readily be combined with multiplexing in frequency and space. In this article, we derive theoretical formulas for quantifying the temporal multimode capacity of AFC-based memories, for both optical memories with fixed storage time and spin-wave memories with longer storage times and on-demand read out. The temporal multimode capacity is expressed in key memory parameters, such as AFC bandwidth, fixed-delay storage time, memory efficiency, and control field Rabi frequency. Current experiments in europium- and praseodymium-doped Y2SiO5 are analyzed within this theoretical framework, which is also tested with newly acquired data, as prospects for higher temporal capacity in these materials are considered. In addition we consider the possibility of spectral and spatial multiplexing to further increase the mode capacity, with examples given for praseodymium doped Y2SiO5.}

The offset frequency noise was suppressed to the statically offset-locked level in less than ~40 $\mu$s upon each frequency switch, allowing the laser to retain the absolute frequency stability of the master laser. This technique satisfies stringent requirements for gas sensing lidars and enables other applications that require such well-controlled precision fast tuning.},

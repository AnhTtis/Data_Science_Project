    "abstract": "We explore the holographic duality between string theory in backgrounds that interpolate between asymptotically linear dilaton spacetime in the UV and $AdS_3$ in the IR, and single-trace $T\\bar T$ deformed CFT. In particular, we explain how the deformation of states in the boundary theory is reflected in the bulk geometry, and show that the coupling above which the deformed energy of the $SL(2,\\mathbb{R})$ invariant ground state of the IR CFT becomes complex is a maximal coupling.",

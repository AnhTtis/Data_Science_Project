A Nonlinear Autoregressive Network with Exogenous Inputs (NARX) approach was applied to the Vichy-Rolla National Airport's photovoltaic station. The proposed model uses several inputs (e.g. time, day of the year, sky cover, pressure, and wind speed) to predict hourly solar irradiance. Data obtained from the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) was used to conduct simulation experiments. These simulations validate the use of the proposed model for short-term predictions. Results show that the NARX neural network notably outperformed the other models and is better than the linear regression model. The use of additional meteorological variables, particularly sky cover, can further improve the prediction performance.},

  abstract = {We present a computational model and algorithm for detecting diffuse and specular interface reflections and some inter-reflections. Our color reflection model is based on the dichromatic model for dielectric materials and on a color space, called S space, formed with three orthogonal basis functions. We transform color pixels measured in RGB into the S space and analyze color variations on objects in terms of brightness, hue and saturation which are defined in the S space. When transforming the original RGB data into the S space, we discount the scene illumination color that is estimated using a white reference plate as an active probe. As a result, the color image appears as if the scene illumination is white. Under the whitened illumination, the interface reflection clusters in the S space are all aligned with the brightness direction. The brightness, hue and saturation values exhibit a more direct correspondence to body colors and to diffuse and specular interface reflections, shading, shadows and interreflections than the RGB coordinates. We exploit these relationships to segment the color image, and to separate specular and diffuse interface reflections and some inter-reflections from body reflections. The proposed algorithm is efficacious for uniformly colored dielectric surfaces under singly colored scene illumination. Experimental results conform to our model and algorithm within the limitations discussed.},

The overall objective of this work was to review the utilization of RF classifier in remote sensing. This review has revealed that RF classifier can successfully handle high data dimensionality and multicolinearity, being both fast and insensitive to overfitting. It is, however, sensitive to the sampling design. The variable importance (VI) measurement provided by the RF classifier has been extensively exploited in different scenarios, for example to reduce the number of dimensions of hyperspectral data, to identify the most relevant multisource remote sensing and geographic data, and to select the most suitable season to classify particular target classes. Further investigations are required into less commonly exploited uses of this classifier, such as for sample proximity analysis to detect and remove outliers in the training samples.},

  abstract = {Estimation of solar radiation is of considerable importance because of the increasing requirement for the design, optimization and performance evaluation of the solar energy systems. This paper presents the development of pattern similarity based clustering algorithm and its application in solar radiation estimation. In the present work continuous density, Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with Pearson R model is utilized for the extraction of shape based clusters from the input meteorological parameters and it is then processed by the Generalized Fuzzy Model (GFM) to accurately estimate the solar radiation. Instead of using distance function as an index of similarity here shape/patterns of the data vectors are used as the similarity index for clustering, which overcomes few of the shortcomings associated with distance based clustering approaches. The estimation method used here exploits the pattern identification prowess of the HMM for cluster selection and generalization and nonlinear modeling capabilities of GFM to predict the solar radiation. The data of solar radiation and various meteorological parameters (sun shine hour, ambient temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and atmospheric pressure) to carry out the present work is taken from the comprehensive weather monitoring station made at Solar Energy Centre, Gurgaon, India. To consider the effect of each meteorological parameter on the estimation of solar radiation the proposed model is applied on 15 different sets comprising of various combinations of input meteorological parameters. The meteorological data of three years from 2009 to 2011 (915days) is used to estimate the solar radiation. Out of these 915days data, the first 750days data is used for the training of the proposed paradigm and rest 165days data is used for validating the model. The results of estimation using all the sets of various combination of meteorological parameter are analyzed and it is found that the sunshine duration is the prime parameter for the estimation of solar radiation. The next important parameter, which influences the estimation of solar radiation, is temperature followed by relative humidity, atmospheric pressure and wind speed. It is interesting to note that worse results are obtained for the sets which are not using sunshine duration as an input. The best performance is achieved by the set which uses all the parameters except the wind speed. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and correlation co-efficient (R-value) of the proposed paradigm for the best performing combination of meteorological parameter are 7.9124, 3.0083 and 0.9921 respectively which shows that the proposed model results are in good agreement with the actual measured solar radiation.},

The winning solution automatically identified individual whales with 87\% accuracy with a series of convolutional neural networks to identify the region of interest on an image, rotate, crop, and create standardized photographs of uniform size and orientation and then identify the correct individual whale from these passport-like photographs. Recent advances in deep learning coupled with this fully automated workflow have yielded impressive results and have the potential to revolutionize traditional methods for the collection of data on the abundance and distribution of wild populations. Presenting these results to a broad audience should further bridge the gap between the data science and conservation science communities.},

  abstract = {This paper presents progress toward a geophysical and biophysical information processor for synthetic aperture radar (SAR). This processor operates in a sequential fashion to first classify terrain according to structural attributes and then apply class-specific retrievals for geophysical and biophysical properties. Structural and electrical attributes control the radar backscattering from terrain. Experimental data and theoretical results illustrate the sensitivity of synthetic aperture radar to structural properties, such as surface roughness and canopy architecture, to soil moisture and to the aboveground biomass of vegetation and its moisture status. Accurate land-cover classification is of great value in many types of regional- to global-scale modeling, and is also an essential precursor to many techniques for extracting geophysical and biophysical information from SAR data. The sensitivity of SAR to the structural features of terrain leads to landcover classification into simple and easily interpreted structural classes. Knowledge-based, hierarchical classifiers require no a priori information or statistical understanding of a local scene, and are found to yield overall accuracy in excess of 90\%. Classification using existing data from the orbital ERS-1 and JERS-1 SARs yield unambiguous land-cover categorizations at greater accuracy and resolution than that afforded by an unsupervised classification of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index as derived from multitemporal AVHRR data. Level I of the SAR terrain classifier differentiates three structural classes; surfaces, short vegetation, and tall vegetation. These classes can be quantized, averaged over the appropriate grid scale and used directly as roughness inputs to general circulation models. Level II of the classifier differentiates vegetation classes on the basis of growth form and leaf type. This level of structural classification is essential in order to improve the performance of semi-empirical approaches for retrieving near-surface soil moisture and aboveground biomass.},

  abstract = {Turbulent vertical nitrate fluxes were calculated using new turbulent microstructure observations in the Lower St. Lawrence Estuary (LSLE), Canada. Two stations were compared: the head of the Laurentian Channel (HLC), where intense mixing occurs on the shallow sill that marks the upstream limit of the LSLE, and another station located about 100 km downstream (St. 23), more representative of the LSLE mean mixing conditions. Mean turbulent diffusivities and nitrate fluxes at the base of the surface layer for both stations were, respectively (with 95\% confidence intervals): K HLC = 8.6(3.2, 19)  10-3 m2 s-1, K23 = 4.4(2.3, 7.6)  10-5 m2 s-1, F HCL = 95(18, 300) mmol m-2 d-1, and F23 = 0.21(0.12, 0.33) mmol m-2 d-1. Observations suggest that the interplay between large isopleth heaving near the sill and strong turbulence is the key mechanism to sustain such high turbulent nitrate fluxes at the HLC (two to three orders of magnitude higher than those at Station 23). Calculations also suggest that nitrate fluxes at the HLC alone can sustain primary production rates of 3.4(0.6, 11) g C m-2 mo-1 over the whole LSLE, approximately enough to account for a large part of the phytoplankton bloom and for most of the postbloom production. Surfacing nitrates are also believed to be consumed within the LSLE, not leaving much to be exported to the rest of the Gulf of St. Lawrence.},

Nevertheless, although many new TSC approaches were proposed recently, a comprehensive overview and empirical evaluation of techniques for the MTSC task is currently missing from the time series literature. In this work, we investigate the state-of-the-art for multivariate time series classification using the UEA MTSC benchmark. We compare recent methods originally developed for univariate TSC, to bespoke methods developed for MTSC, ranging from the classic DTW baseline to very recent linear classifiers (e.g., MrSEQL, ROCKET) and deep learning methods (e.g., MLSTM-FCN, TapNet). We aim to understand whether there is any benefit in learning complex dependencies across different time series dimensions versus treating dimensions as independent time series, and we analyse the predictive accuracy, as well as the efficiency of these methods. In addition, we propose a simple statistics-based time series classifier as an alternative to the DTW baseline. We show that our simple classifier is as accurate as DTW, but is an order of magnitude faster. We also find that recent methods that achieve state-of-the-art accuracy for univariate TSC, such as ROCKET, also achieve high accuracy on the MTSC task, but recent deep learning MTSC methods do not perform as well as expected.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for image restoration (deconvolution) based on a penalized likelihood formulated in the wavelet domain. Regularization is achieved by promoting a reconstruction with low-complexity, expressed in the wavelet coefficients, taking advantage of the well known sparsity of wavelet representations. Previous works have investigated wavelet-based restoration but, except for certain special cases, the resulting criteria are solved approximately or require demanding optimization methods. The EM algorithm herein proposed combines the efficient image representation offered by the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) with the diagonalization of the convolution operator obtained in the Fourier domain. Thus, it is a general-purpose approach to wavelet-based image restoration with computational complexity comparable to that of standard wavelet denoising schemes or of frequency domain deconvolution methods. The algorithm alternates between an E-step based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and a DWT-based M-step, resulting in an efficient iterative process requiring O(NlogN) operations per iteration. The convergence behavior of the algorithm is investigated, and it is shown that under mild conditions the algorithm converges to a globally optimal restoration. Moreover, our new approach performs competitively with, in some cases better than, the best existing methods in benchmark tests.},

  abstract = {GLANCE (GLare ANnual Classes Evaluation) is a simplified method to evaluate glare conditions over a grid of points in a space on an annual basis. The method is based on three methodological assumptions: (i) the vertical illuminance (Ev) is adopted as the parameter to estimate the daylight glare condition in each point of the space; (ii) daylight glare conditions are expressed in terms of Daylight Glare Comfort Classes (DGCCs); (iii) the annual time-series of Ev and DGP for a single reference point are calculated and correlated to determine the DGCC of each point. The method allows faster glare analyses to be performed, compared to the time needed for spatio-temporal analyses using DGP. To describe the method and demonstrate its accuracy, a study was carried out using a sample space with three orientations (East, South, and West) and a glazing with various light transmittances in the range 0.05-0.75. A grid of 9 viewpoints, with 5 view directions, was assumed, for a total of 2160 combinations. The performance of the GLANCE method proved to be robust in estimating the DGCCs for the cases analysed, as shown by the Youden index, which was higher than 0.85 for over 90\% of the cases considered.},

In this paper, we address this problem for non-stationary time series, which is very challenging yet crucially important. We introduce the STRIPE model for representing structured diversity based on shape and time features, ensuring both probable predictions while being sharp and accurate. STRIPE is agnostic to the forecasting model, and we equip it with a diversification mechanism relying on determinantal point processes (DPP). We introduce two DPP kernels for modeling diverse trajectories in terms of shape and time, which are both differentiable and proved to be positive semi-definite. To have an explicit control on the diversity structure, we also design an iterative sampling mechanism to disentangle shape and time representations in the latent space. Experiments carried out on synthetic datasets show that STRIPE significantly outperforms baseline methods for representing diversity, while maintaining accuracy of the forecasting model. We also highlight the relevance of the iterative sampling scheme and the importance to use different criteria for measuring quality and diversity. Finally, experiments on real datasets illustrate that STRIPE is able to outperform state-of-the-art probabilistic forecasting approaches in the best sample prediction.},

These conventional practices stem from three problematic presuppositions: (1) the separation of theory and history, (2) ahistorical conceptions of time, and (3) methodological autonomy and the primacy of the theory of statistical technique. We illustrate how these premises shape sociological-historical investigation by examining several quantitative historical analyses of labor organization and conflict. Reanalysis of the same historical series with "temporally moving covariance" analysis demonstrates theoretically important historical contingency as well as the error of presupposing temporal homogeneity in historical relationships. Our critique of conventional practice and our reanalysis enable us to pose alternative premises to ground quantitative historical research in the interdependence of history and theory, in historical conceptions of time, and in the historicization of quantitative methodology. Our redirection aims at moving us closer to historical "actuality," that is, to historical relations and processes, when we use time-series data and analytic procedures.},

The resulting \textbackslash emph\{neural controlled differential equation\} model is directly applicable to the general setting of partially-observed irregularly-sampled multivariate time series, and (unlike previous work on this problem) it may utilise memory-efficient adjoint-based backpropagation even across observations. We demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance against similar (ODE or RNN based) models in empirical studies on a range of datasets. Finally we provide theoretical results demonstrating universal approximation, and that our model subsumes alternative ODE models.},

  abstract = {The Gulf of St Lawrence (GSL) provides several species of North Atlantic baleen whale with an abundant supply of krill, dominated by Thysanoessa raschii and Meganyctiphanes norvegica. We aimed to quantify the differences in upstream advection resulting from the interaction between the circulation and the specific diel vertical migration of T. raschii and M. norvegica at the scale of the northwest GSL. We coupled a regional circulation model with Lagrangian models where the daytime depth followed specific functions of surface salinity. Our results help to explain the spatio-temporal variability in both T. raschii and M. norvegica distributions. We identified in particular spatio-temporal patterns in krill upstream transport. During summer and autumn, the upstream transport of krill is steady across Jacques Cartier Strait, limited across Honguedo Strait, and more sporadic across the Estuary mouth. We estimated that the upstream advection of krill particles across the Estuary mouth would be higher by 16\textendash{} 17\% for the T. raschii than for the M. norvegica daytime behaviour. Our results also suggest that the advective processes operating on the adults during the productive season are not the only cause for the observed magnitude of the interannual and interspecific variability in krill abundance.},

  abstract = {Ocean surveillance via high-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imageries has been a hot issue because SAR is able to work in all-day and all-weather conditions. The launch of Chinese Gaofen-3 (GF-3) satellite has provided a large number of SAR imageries, making it possible to marine targets monitoring. However, it is difficult for traditional methods to extract effective features to classify and detect different types of marine targets in SAR images. This paper proposes a convolutional neutral network (CNN) model for marine target classification at patch level and an overall scheme for marine target detection in large-scale SAR images. First, eight types of marine targets in GF-3 SAR images are labelled based on feature analysis, building the datasets for further experiments. As for the classification task at patch level, a novel CNN model with six convolutional layers, three pooling layers, and two fully connected layers has been designed. With respect to the detection part, a Single Shot Multi-box Detector with a multi-resolution input (MR-SSD) is developed, which can extract more features at different resolution versions. In order to detect different targets in large-scale SAR images, a whole workflow including sea-land segmentation, cropping with overlapping, detection with MR-SSD model, coordinates mapping, and predicted boxes consolidation is developed. Experiments based on the GF-3 dataset demonstrate the merits of the proposed methods for marine target classification and detection.},

Experimental and computed Q values are in excellent agreement. This successful comparison confirms the importance of the bidirectional character of ocean reflectance, already pointed out from a purely numerical approach without field validation, and corroborates the extended range of the Q variations. The later point is of importance when interpreting the marine signals detected by an ocean color satellite-borne sensor. The validation is extended by considering the historical data for the radiance distributions in Lake Pend Oreille determined at various depths. The closure issue in ocean optics is examined by solving the direct problem of radiative transfer and through a model-data comparison in terms of radiance field.},

  abstract = {Specular reflections and interreflections produce strong highlights in brightness images. These highlights can cause vision algorithms for segmentation, shape from shading, binocular stereo, and motion estimation to produce erroneous results. A technique is developed for separating the specular and diffuse components of reflection from images. The approach is to use color and polarization information, simultaneously, to obtain constraints on the reflection components at each image point. Polarization yields local and independent estimates of the color of specular reflection. The result is a linear subspace in color space in which the local diffuse component must lie. This subspace constraint is applied to neighboring image points to determine the diffuse component. In contrast to previous separation algorithms, the proposed method can handle highlights on surfaces with substantial texture, smoothly varying diffuse reflectance, and varying material properties. The separation algorithm is applied to several complex scenes with textured objects and strong interreflections. The separation results are then used to solve three problems pertinent to visual perception; determining illumination color, estimating illumination direction, and shape recovery.},

The objective of the classifier is to automate labour intensive and subjective components of the work performed by trained Marine Mammal Observers (MMOs). The proposed automatic method is based on a cascaded random forest architecture. The method uses features extracted from the histogram of the survey's images and the metadata associated with respective images. The use of metadata is justified by the image formation model and we observed that it tends to improve the accuracy of the classifier. The proposed method provides results similar to that of trained MMOs. This is critical to the adoption of machine learning and machine vision technologies since introducing a change of methodology may impact the comparability of historic and future survey results when evaluating glare intensity.},

This combination of large datasets with continuous pipelines feeding a real-time simulation forces us to bring together innovations on both the cloud infrastructure and user interface level.},

  abstract = {The X-ray images are extensively used by the medical practitioners to detect the minute fractures of bone images as they are painless and economical compared to other image modalities. The minute fractures cannot be identified with nacked eye. So the X-ray images are to be processed for detecting the minute fractures. The orthogonal wavelet transforms like Haar, daubechies etc can be used as edge detector, but a lot of false edge information will be extracted. Edge detection of X-ray images using Multiresolution Analysis(MRA) based biorthogonal wavelets is more preferable when compared with orthogonal wavelets because of more flexibility.. Therefore biorthogonal wavelet transforms like bior1.3,bior2.4 are applied to detect the edges and are compared for edge feature extraction. Among all the methods, biorthogonal wavelet bior1.3 performs well in detecting the edges with better quality. The various performance metrics like Ratio of Edge pixels to size of image (REPS), peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and computation time are compared for various wavelets for edge detection.},

  abstract = {Modern sediment distribution in Baie des Chaleurs is controlled primarily by an interplay of water depth and wave climate. Modern sediment textures range from gravelly sand to silty clays. Much of the central part of the bay is covered by deposits of gravelly sand that are being reworked by wave turbulence and bottom currents. The present pattern of sedimentation started about 6000 years ago, and for about the past 5000 years, different sediment types have developed in various parts of the bay because of an interplay between tidal currents, wave-induced turbulence, and water depth. At present, this interplay is most intense in shallow nearshore environments, especially on the south side of the bay. Evidence cited elsewhere in the literature suggests that Atlantic waters may have flooded the Chaleur Trough as early as 14\hspace{0.6em}000 years ago. This transgression gave way to a temporary regression about 8000 to 10\hspace{0.6em}000 years ago because of a relatively rapid glacial rebound compared with the eustatic sea-level rise. A depositional pattern similar to that observed today probably occurred from 12\hspace{0.6em}000 to 13\hspace{0.6em}000 years B.P. but with more marine conditions than present, extending as far west as Dalhousie, New Brunswick.},

  abstract = {The local heat content and formation rate of the cold intermediate layer (CIL) in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence are examined using a combination of new in situ wintertime observations and a three-dimensional numerical model. The field observations consist of five moorings located throughout the gulf over the period of November 2002 to June 2003. The observations demonstrate a substantially deeper surface mixed layer in the central and northeast gulf than in regions downstream of the buoyant surface outflow from the Saint Lawrence Estuary. The mixed-layer depth in the estuary remains shallow ({$<$}60 m) throughout winter, with the arrival of a layer of near-freezing waters between 40 and 100 m depth in April. An eddy-permitting ice-ocean model with realistic forcing is used to hindcast the period of observation. The model simulates well the seasonal evolution of mixed-layer depth and CIL heat content. Although the greatest heat losses occur in the northeast, the most significant change in CIL heat content over winter occurs in the Anticosti Trough. The observed renewal of CIL in the estuary in spring is captured by the model. The simulation highlights the role of the northwest gulf, and in particular, the separation of the Gasp\'e Current, in controlling the exchange of CIL between the estuary and the gulf. In order to isolate the effects of inflow through the Strait of Belle Isle on the CIL heat content, we examine a sensitivity experiment in which the strait is closed. This simulation shows that the inflow has a less important effect on the CIL than was suggested by previous studies.},

The prediction of glare is carried out with the help of computational software for a randomly selected area within the boundary of Kuantan airport, Malaysia. The selected zone is not suitable for solar installations as per FAA's glare policy. In the selected area (Apv), the duration of glare on ATCT from solar modules installed is 6778 min (green and yellow glare). Also, the flight path is free from any kind of glare occurrence. Glare occurs between March to mid-October, mostly from 7.00 a.m. to 8.00 a.m. Green and Yellow glare last up to 10 min and 30 min respectively in a year. In this regard, remedial steps for mitigating possible glare are discussed. Glare prediction helps in the early adoption of suitable remedial measures against glare hazard.},

Since 2012, there have been significant advances in representation capabilities of the models and computational capabilities of GPUs. But the size of the biggest dataset has surprisingly remained constant. What will happen if we increase the dataset size by 10\texttimes{} or 100\texttimes? This paper takes a step towards clearing the clouds of mystery surrounding the relationship between `enormous data' and visual deep learning. By exploiting the JFT-300M dataset which has more than 375M noisy labels for 300M images, we investigate how the performance of current vision tasks would change if this data was used for representation learning. Our paper delivers some surprising (and some expected) findings. First, we find that the performance on vision tasks increases logarithmically based on volume of training data size. Second, we show that representation learning (or pretraining) still holds a lot of promise. One can improve performance on many vision tasks by just training a better base model. Finally, as expected, we present new state-of-theart results for different vision tasks including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation and human pose estimation. Our sincere hope is that this inspires vision community to not undervalue the data and develop collective efforts in building larger datasets.},

  abstract = {Sunlight contamination dominates the backscatter noise in spacebased lidar measurements during daytime. The background scattered sunlight is highly variable and dependent upon the surface and atmospheric albedo. The scattered sunlight contribution to noise increases over land and snow surfaces where surface albedos are high and thus overwhelm lidar backscatter from optically thin atmospheric constituents like aerosols and thin clouds. In this work, we developed a novel lidar remote sensing concept that potentially can eliminate sunlight induced noise. The new lidar concept requires: (1) a transmitted laser light that carries orbital angular momentum (OAM); and (2) a photon sieve (PS) diffractive filter that separates scattered sunlight from laser light backscattered from the atmosphere, ocean and solid surfaces. The method is based on numerical modeling of the focusing of Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) laser beam and planewave light by a PS. The model results show that after passing through a PS, laser light that carries the OAM is focused on a ring (called ``focal ring'' here) on the focal plane of the PS filter, very little energy arrives at the center of the focal plane. However, scattered sunlight, as a plane wave without the OAM, focuses at the center of the focal plane and thus can be effectively blocked or ducted out. We also find that the radius of the ``focal ring'' increases with the increase of azimuthal mode (L) of LG laser light, thus increasing L can more effectively separate the lidar signal away from the sunlight noise.},

  abstract = {R\'ESUM\'E             La baie des Chaleurs, quatri\`eme estuaire en importance de l'est du Canada, est un large bassin peu profond rempli de s\'ediments non consolid\'es d'une \'epaisseur allant jusqu'\`a 50 m. La r\'epartition de cette masse s\'edimentaire est en partie impos\'ee par le r\'eseau de drainage datant du C\'enozo\"ique (Tertiaire ou Quaternaire), qui suit les principaux \'el\'ements structuraux du socle s\'edimentaire sous-jacent. Les d\'ep\^ots de contact glaciaire pleistocenes, y compris le till, sont g\'en\'eralement minces ou absents. Toutefois, au centre et vers l'ext\'erieur de la baie, les chenaux c\'enozo\"iques renferment les accumulations morainiques lin\'eaires, jusqu'\`a 30 m d'\'epaisseur, qui pourraient signaler l'emplacement final du d\^ome de la Gasp\'esie. Six grands c\^ones glaciomarins identifient les exutoires en fonction pendant la phase de retrait des calottes r\'egionales. Ces d\'ep\^ots pl\'eistoc\`enes ont en partie \'et\'e \'erodes par des chenaux de drainage fluvioglaciaires pendant une phase de bas niveau marin (-90 m), vers 9000 BP. Par la suite, au cours de la transgression marine de l'Holoc\`ene inf\'erieur \`a moyen, les s\'ediments glaciaires ont \'et\'e soumis \`a l'\'erosion par les vagues. Les d\'ep\^ots s'amincissent donc en eaux peu profondes et sont caract\'eris\'es par la pr\'esence de terrasses parall\`eles \`a la rive et des surfaces de s\'ediments grossiers le long des marges de la baie. \`A 7000 BP, le complexe de sandur qui occupait le fond peu profond de la baie a aussi \'et\'e atteint par la transgression marine. La surface du delta \'etait prot\'eg\'ee par une barri\`ere morainique. Les s\'ediments de l'Holoc\`ene inf\'erieur ont d'abord \'et\'e d\'epos\'es dans les eaux plus profondes du centre et de l'entr\'ee de la baie et ont subs\'equemment form\'e une pellicule sur le sandur du fond de la baie \`a mesure que le niveau marin montait. Ces s\'ediments montrent une progression dans la stratification et la granulom\'etrie en relation avec les fluctuations du niveau marin et des sources s\'edimentaires. Les conditions oc\'eanographiques modernes se sont \'etablies il y a environ 5000 ans.           ,              ABSTRACT             Baie des Chaleurs is the fourth largest estuary in eastern Canada. The bay is a broad and shallow basin, filled with up to 50 m of unconsolidated Quaternary sediment. The distribution of this sedimentary mass is in part controlled by a Cenozoic (Tertiary or Quaternary) drainage system that follows the main structural elements of the underlying Paleozoic sedimentary bedrock. Ice-contact Pleistocene sediment, including till, is generally thin or absent. However, in the central and outer bay the Cenozoic channels contain linear morainal accumulations up to 30 m thick. These deposits may indicate the terminal position of the Gasp\'e ice dome. Six large but separate glacimarine fans mark the position of major discharge outlets that operated during the retreat phase of the regional ice sheets. These Pleistocene deposits were partly eroded by glacifluvial drainage channels during a low sea level stand (-90 m) circa 9000 years BP. Subsequently, during the early to middle Holocene marine transgression, the glacigenic sediments were subjected to wave erosion. These deposits thus thin towards shallower water and are marked by shore-parallel terraces and surface lags along the margins of the bay. By 7000 years BP, a sandur complex located in the shallower inner bay was also transgressed by the rising sea. Early Holocene sedimentation occurred initially in the deeper waters of the central and outer bay, and subsequently formed an extensive veneer across the inner bay sandur with rising sea levels. These paraglacial sediments show a progression in bedding styles and particle size related to sea level position and sediment source. Modern oc\'eanographie conditions became established circa 5000 years ago, and include increased tidal and wave activity, and decreased sediment discharge. Modern sediments are deposited principally beneath a mid-bay gyre set up by the influx of the Gasp\'e current along the north shore and the efflux of fresher water along the New Brunswick shore.           ,              ZUSAMMENFASSUNG             Die Baie des Chaleurs ist das viertgr\^oBte M\`undungsbecken in Ostkanada. Die Bucht ist ein breites und fla-ches Becken, das mit bis zu 50 m dicken, nicht konsolidierten Quatern\^ar-Ablagerungen angefullt ist. Die Verteilung dieser Sediment-Masse wird zum Teil durch ein AbfluBsystem aus dem Cenozoikum (Tertiar oder Quatern\`ar) kontrolliert, das den haupts\`achlichen Strukturelementen der darunterliegenden Ablagerung anstehenden Ges-teins aus dem Pal\`aozoikum folgt. Eis-Kontakt-Sediment aus dem Pleistoz\`an einschlieBlich Till ist im allgemeinen d\`unn oder nicht vorhanden. Indessen enthalten die Cenozoikum-Kan\`ale im Zentrum und in der\`auBeren Bucht bis zu 30 m dicke, lineare Mor\`anen-Akkumulationen. Di\`ese Ablagerun-gen k\^onnten die Endposition des Gasp\'e-Eisdoms anzeigen. Sechs breite aber getrennte glaziomarine F\^acher zeigen die Position der wichtigsten Wasserabfl\`usse an, die w\`ahrend der R\`uckzugsphase der regionalen Eisdecke aktiv waren. Di\`ese Pleistoz\`an-Ablagerungen wurden zum Teil durch glazifluviale AbfluBkan\`ale w\`ahrend eines niedrigen Meeresniveaus (-90 m) um etwa 9000 Jahre v.u.Z. abgetragen. Danach, w\`ahrend der marinen Transgression im fr\`uhen bis mittleren Holoz\`an, unterlagen die glazigenen Ablagerungen einer Abtragung durch Wellen. Di\`ese Ablagerungen verd\`unnen sich auf di\`ese Weise zum seichteren Wasser hin, und zeichnen sich durch parallel zur K\`uste liegende Terrassen und Fl\`achen groben Sediments entlang den R\^andern der Bucht aus. Um 7 000 Jahre v.u.Z. erreichte die Transgression des ansteigenden Meeres einen Sandur-Komplex, der sich in der seichteren inneren Bucht befand. Anfangs kam es zu fr\`uher Holoz\`an-Sedimentierung in den tieferen Wassern des Zentrums und Eingangs der Bucht, und di\`ese bildete anschlieBend einen extensiven Schleier durch die Sandur der inneren Bucht, w\`ahrend der Meeres-spiegel anstieg. Di\`ese paraglazialen Sedimente weisen eine Progression in der Stratifizierung und der Korngr\^oBe auf, abh\`angig von der Position des Meeresniveaus und der Sedimentquelle.},

The dichromatic reflection model describes the surface reflection as the sum of two components, diffuse and specular terms. The specular reflection component is usually strong in its intensity and polarized significantly compared to the diffuse components. On the other hand, the intensity of the diffuse component is weak and it tends to be unpolarized except near occluding contours. Thus, the observation of an object through a rotating polarizer approximately yields images containing constant diffuse component and specular component of different intensity. In this paper, we show that diffuse and specular components of surface reflection can be separated as two independent components when we apply Independent Component Analysis to the images observed through a polarizer of different orientations. We give a separation simulation of artificial data and also give some separation results of real scenes.},

However, its potential for application to strategic maritime search and rescue (SAR) planning remains largely unexplored. To investigate the applicability of GIS-based tools to this problem, this paper presents an approach to evaluate accessibility and response times in a sea area. Such information aids to objectify the response effectiveness of a SAR system, which is important for rational resource allocation. The presented methodology accounts for the main characteristics of maritime response, namely spatial accessibility, capabilities of search and rescue units (SRUs) and prevailing wave conditions, which affect the attainable SRU speeds. An application to the Finnish areas of the Gulf of Finland is shown. Despite the existence of some difficulties with currently available tools (e.g. accurate and user-friendly spatial wave models and challenges with using raster-based methods in topologically complex areas) and limitations in knowledge (e.g. the SRU capabilities in actual operations), the results indicate that the methodology provides good opportunities for enhancing maritime decision making.},

  abstract = {The western gulf of St. Lawrence (GSL) is characterized by high, persistent phytoplankton production and functions as the principal supplier of phytoplankton biomass for the central and eastern Gulf. The main objective of this study was to report on the evolution of a wind-induced phytoplankton bloom in this region. We used Coastal Zone Color Scanner images taken on 20, 22, 28, and 30 August 1980 to calculate phytoplankton pigment concentration, sea surface temperature and water reflectance fields. We coupled the satellite information with storm track, wind, air temperature, and bright sunshine data. A strong storm blew over the Gulf between 15 and 17 August, triggering upwelling and mixing processes that presumably made high nutrient concentrations available in the euphotic layer. High atmospheric pressure and southwesterly winds between 18 and 25 August allowed air and water temperatures to rise, stabilizing the water column and stimulating phytoplankton growth. A northern storm between 25 and 27 August associated with clear weather and low temperatures between 28 and 30 August, coinciding with the bloom decline. Water-normalized reflectance values suggested that the estuarine region was characterized by diatoms, the western-central GSL by a mixed composition of diatoms/small flagellates/coccolithophorids, and the eastern-central region by coccolithophorids and small flagellates. These blooms may be critical for fish recruitment. Cooling and warming of the water column by meteorological events seem to be intermittent but frequency at this time of year. The resulting nutrient input may support phytoplankton blooms of intensities similar to or higher than those recorded during spring in the western region of the Gulf.},

  abstract = {Accurate solar photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting is an essential tool for mitigating the negative effects caused by the uncertainty of PV output power in systems with high penetration levels of solar PV generation. Weather classification based modeling is an effective way to increase the accuracy of day-ahead short-term (DAST) solar PV power forecasting because PV output power is strongly dependent on the specific weather conditions in a given time period. However, the accuracy of daily weather classification relies on both the applied classifiers and the training data. This paper aims to reveal how these two factors impact the classification performance and to delineate the relation between classification accuracy and sample dataset scale. Two commonly used classification methods, K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and support vector machines (SVM) are applied to classify the daily local weather types for DAST solar PV power forecasting using the operation data from a grid-connected PV plant in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, China. We assessed the performance of SVM and KNN approaches, and then investigated the influences of sample scale, the number of categories, and the data distribution in different categories on the daily weather classification results. The simulation results illustrate that SVM performs well with small sample scale, while KNN is more sensitive to the length of the training dataset and can achieve higher accuracy than SVM with sufficient samples.},

Cloud cover is one of the most important variables that affects solar power generation, but is also characterized by a high degree of variability and uncertainty. Deep learning methods have the ability to learn long-term dependencies within sequential data. We investigate the application of Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) to forecast solar irradiance and present the results of applying multivariate GRU to forecast hourly solar irradiance in Phoenix, Arizona. We compare and evaluate the performance of GRU against Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) using strictly historical solar irradiance data as well as the addition of exogenous weather variables and cloud cover data. Based on our results, we found that the addition of exogenous weather variables and cloud cover data in both GRU and LSTM significantly improved forecasting accuracy, performing better than univariate and statistical models.},

  abstract = {Semi-supervised learning lately has shown much promise in improving deep learning models when labeled data is scarce. Common among recent approaches is the use of consistency training on a large amount of unlabeled data to constrain model predictions to be invariant to input noise. In this work, we present a new perspective on how to effectively noise unlabeled examples and argue that the quality of noising, specifically those produced by advanced data augmentation methods, plays a crucial role in semi-supervised learning. By substituting simple noising operations with advanced data augmentation methods such as RandAugment and back-translation, our method brings substantial improvements across six language and three vision tasks under the same consistency training framework. On the IMDb text classification dataset, with only 20 labeled examples, our method achieves an error rate of 4.20, outperforming the state-of-the-art model trained on 25,000 labeled examples. On a standard semi-supervised learning benchmark, CIFAR-10, our method outperforms all previous approaches and achieves an error rate of 5.43 with only 250 examples. Our method also combines well with transfer learning, e.g., when finetuning from BERT, and yields improvements in high-data regime, such as ImageNet, whether when there is only 10\% labeled data or when a full labeled set with 1.3M extra unlabeled examples is used.

There is very limited literature on detecting sun glare for automated driving. It is primarily based on finding saturated brightness areas and extracting regions via image processing heuristics. From the perspective of a safety system, it is necessary to have a highly robust algorithm. Thus we designed two complementary algorithms using classical image processing techniques and CNN which can learn global context. We also discuss how sun glare detection algorithm will efficiently fit into a typical automated driving system. As there is no public dataset, we created our own and will release it publicly via theWoodScape project [1] to encourage further research in this area.},

Three forecasting methods are proposed using different types of meteorological data as input parameters, namely, global horizontal irradiance (GHI), diffuse horizontal irradiance (DHI), direct normal irradiance (DNI) and cloud cover. The first method directly uses GHI to forecast next hour GHI through additive seasonal decomposition followed by an Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. The second method forecasts DHI and DNI separately using additive seasonal decomposition followed by an ARIMA model and then combines the two forecasts to predict GHI using an atmospheric model. The third method considers cloud cover effects. An ARIMA model is used to predict cloud transients. GHI at different zenith angles and under different cloud cover conditions is constructed using nonlinear regression, i.e., we create a look-up table of GHI regression models for different cloud cover conditions. All three methods are tested using data from two weather stations in the USA: Miami and Orlando. It is found that forecasts using cloud cover information can improve the forecast accuracy.},

  abstract = {Electricity power grid operations require information about demand and supply on a variety of timescales and areas. The advent of significant generation contributions by time variable renewable energy sources means that forecasting methods are increasingly required. Some of the earliest requirements will be for spatial-temporal estimation of solar irradiance and the resulting photovoltaic-generated electricity. Accurate forecasts represent an important step towards building a smart grid for renewable energy driven cities or regions, and to this end we develop forecasting tools that use data from ground-based irradiance sensors. Spatial-temporal datasets that enjoy the properties of stationarity, full symmetry and separability are in general more amenable to forecasting using time-forward kriging algorithms. Usually, none of these properties obtain in meteorological data such as wind velocity fields and solar irradiance distributions. In this paper, we construct a statistical forecast system to mitigate this problem. We first achieve temporal stationarity by detrending solar irradiance time series at individual monitoring stations. We then approximate spatial stationarity through deformations of the geographic coordinates. Various spatial-temporal variance-covariance structures are formed to explore full symmetry and separability. Finally, time-forward kriging is used to forecast the hourly spatial-temporal solar irradiance data from 10 Singapore weather stations. The aim of the proposed system is to forecast irradiance and PV electricity generation at arbitrary spatial locations within a monitored area.},

However, the automated vehicle might be faced severe situations for sensing due to heavy sunshine. If the image captured by the onboard camera is overexposed, the image information will be lost and there is a risk of false detection. In particular, in traffic light detection where the acquisition of color information is essential, if the front traffic light and the sun overlap during intersection driving, it will not be possible to make an appropriate intersection approach judgment. Therefore, this paper developed the method to recognize sun-glare regions in the image using visual explanations of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The CNN outputs an attention map using the Grad-CAM method, and then the global direction of the sun-glare region can be estimated by time-series processing. The developed method contributes to implementing robust image recognitions by estimating the direction in which visibility is reduced by sunlight such as direct sunlight and reflected light from buildings.},

The seven locations were chosen to represent a diverse set of maritime, mediterranean, arid and semi-arid micro-climates. Ground stations from the California Irrigation Management Information System were used to obtain solar irradiance time-series from the points of interest. In this method, firstly, we define areas with the highest correlated time-series between the satellite-derived data and the ground data. Secondly, we select satellite-derived data from these regions as exogenous variables to several forecast models (linear models, Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Regression) to predict GHI at the seven locations. The results show that using linear forecasting models and a genetic algorithm to optimize the selection of multiple time-lagged exogenous variables results in significant forecasting improvements over other benchmark models.},

Intuitively, it seemed that applying these novel tools to edge detection should acquire finer performance. In this paper, we propose an edge detection approach based on directional wavelet transform which retains the separable filtering and the simplicity of computations and filter design from the standard 2D WT. In addition, the corresponding gradient magnitude is redefined and a new algorithm for non-maximum suppression is described.

In this paper, a postprocessing-based VideoSAR imaging scheme suitable for frequency-domain SAR algorithms is proposed to achieve more flexible application. First, the full-aperture image can be partitioned into the stationary region and a dynamic region of interest (DROI). Then the selected DROI data is segmented at a certain overlapping rate in the azimuth Doppler spectrum. Thus, the unified VideoSAR image coordinate system is achieved, and hence extra image registration technique is avoided. Moreover, VideoSAR can distinguish the relationship between the stationary target and shadow for a more accurate retrieval of height information. Subsequently, a complete procedure of information extraction without geometric prior knowledge, including denoising algorithm, threshold segmentation, matching strategy, and height retrieval is proposed in detail. Based on varying shadows and scattering characteristics in the DROI, multiple experiments using real airborne X-band VideoSAR data validate the feasibility of the proposed imaging scheme and the height retrieval method can achieve a higher accuracy.},

This ratio, Q[θ′, θ0, (φ0 − φ)], where θ′, φ are the nadir and azimuth angles for the upward radiance and θ0, φ0 are the zenith and azimuth angles of the Sun, has been determined from measurements at sea and computed via Monte Carlo simulations using the inherent optical properties measured in the field and appropriate boundary conditions (clear sky, no wind, varying Sun angle). Experimental and computed Q values are in excellent agreement. This successful comparison confirms the importance of the bidirectional character of ocean reflectance, already pointed out from a purely numerical approach without field validation, and corroborates the extended range of the Q variations. The later point is of importance when interpreting the marine signals detected by an ocean color satellite-borne sensor. The validation is extended by considering the historical data for the radiance distributions in Lake Pend Oreille determined at various depths. The closure issue in ocean optics is examined by solving the direct problem of radiative transfer and through a model-data comparison in terms of radiance field.},

We propose Reliable Label Bootstrapping (ReLaB), an unsupervised preprossessing algorithm which improves the performance of semi-supervised algorithms in extremely low supervision settings. Given a dataset with few labeled samples, we first learn meaningful self-supervised, latent features for the data. Second, a label propagation algorithm propagates the known labels on the unsupervised features, effectively labeling the full dataset in an automatic fashion. Third, we select a subset of correctly labeled (reliable) samples using a label noise detection algorithm. Finally, we train a semi-supervised algorithm on the extended subset. We show that the selection of the network architecture and the self-supervised algorithm are important factors to achieve successful label propagation and demonstrate that ReLaB substantially improves semi-supervised learning in scenarios of very limited supervision on image classification benchmarks such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and mini-ImageNet. We reach average error rates of 22.34 with 1 random labeled sample per class on CIFAR-10 and lower this error to 8.46 when the labeled sample in each class is highly representative.

MixMatch obtains state-of-the-art results by a large margin across many datasets and labeled data amounts. For example, on CIFAR-10 with 250 labels, we reduce error rate by a factor of 4 (from 38\% to 11\%) and by a factor of 2 on STL-10. We also demonstrate how MixMatch can help achieve a dramatically better accuracy-privacy trade-off for differential privacy. Finally, we perform an ablation study to tease apart which components of MixMatch are most important for its success. Code is attached.},

Two prominent directions include learning with noisy labels and semi-supervised learning by exploiting unlabeled data. In this work, we propose DivideMix, a novel framework for learning with noisy labels by leveraging semi-supervised learning techniques. In particular, DivideMix models the per-sample loss distribution with a mixture model to dynamically divide the training data into a labeled set with clean samples and an unlabeled set with noisy samples, and trains the model on both the labeled and unlabeled data in a semi-supervised manner. To avoid confirmation bias, we simultaneously train two diverged networks where each network uses the dataset division from the other network. During the semi-supervised training phase, we improve the MixMatch strategy by performing label co-refinement and label co-guessing on labeled and unlabeled samples, respectively. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at https://github.com/LiJunnan1992/DivideMix .},

  abstract = {Deep learning has gained popularity in a variety of computer vision tasks. Recently, it has also been successfully applied for hyperspectral image classification tasks. Training deep neural networks, such as a convolutional neural network for classification requires a large number of labeled samples. However, in remote sensing applications, we usually only have a small amount of labeled data for training because they are expensive to collect, although we still have abundant unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose semi-supervised deep learning for hyperspectral image classification-our approach uses limited labeled data and abundant unlabeled data to train a deep neural network. More specifically, we use deep convolutional recurrent neural networks (CRNN) for hyperspectral image classification by treating each hyperspectral pixel as a spectral sequence. In the proposed semi-supervised learning framework, the abundant unlabeled data are utilized with their pseudo labels (cluster labels). We propose to use all the training data together with their pseudo labels to pre-train a deep CRNN, and then fine-tune using the limited available labeled data. Further, to utilize spatial information in the hyperspectral images, we propose a constrained Dirichlet process mixture model (C-DPMM), a non-parametric Bayesian clustering algorithm, for semi-supervised clustering which includes pairwise must-link and cannot-link constraints-this produces high-quality pseudo-labels, resulting in improved initialization of the deep neural network. We also derived a variational inference model for the C-DPMM for efficient inference. Experimental results with real hyperspectral image data sets demonstrate that the proposed semi-supervised method outperforms state-of-the-art supervised and semi-supervised learning methods for hyperspectral classification.},

  abstract = {Because of their effectiveness in broad practical applications, LSTM networks have received a wealth of coverage in scientific journals, technical blogs, and implementation guides. However, in most articles, the inference formulas for the LSTM network and its parent, RNN, are stated axiomatically, while the training formulas are omitted altogether. In addition, the technique of ``unrolling'' an RNN is routinely presented without justification throughout the literature. The goal of this tutorial is to explain the essential RNN and LSTM fundamentals in a single document. Drawing from concepts in Signal Processing, we formally derive the canonical RNN formulation from differential equations. We then propose and prove a precise statement, which yields the RNN unrolling technique. We also review the difficulties with training the standard RNN and address them by transforming the RNN into the ``Vanilla LSTM''1 1The nickname ``Vanilla LSTM'' symbolizes this model's flexibility and generality (Greff et~al., 2015). network through a series of logical arguments. We provide all equations pertaining to the LSTM system together with detailed descriptions of its constituent entities. Albeit unconventional, our choice of notation and the method for presenting the LSTM system emphasizes ease of understanding. As part of the analysis, we identify new opportunities to enrich the LSTM system and incorporate these extensions into the Vanilla LSTM network, producing the most general LSTM variant to date. The target reader has already been exposed to RNNs and LSTM networks through numerous available resources and is open to an alternative pedagogical approach. A Machine Learning practitioner seeking guidance for implementing our new augmented LSTM model in software for experimentation and research will find the insights and derivations in this treatise valuable as well.},

    "abstract": "Resetting a stochastic process is an important problem describing the evolution of physical, biological and other systems which are continually returned to their some fixed point different from their initial position. We consider the motion of a subdiffusive particle with a constant drift under Poissonian resetting. In this model the stochastic process is Brownian motion subordinated by an inverse infinitely divisible process (subordinator). Although this approach includes a wide class of subdiffusive system with Poissonian resetting by using different subordinators, each of such systems has a stationary state with the asymmetric Laplace distribution in which the scale and asymmetric parameters depend on the Laplace exponent of used subordinators. Moreover, the mean time for the particle to reach a target is finite and has a minimum, optimal with respect to the resetting rate. Features of Levy motion under this resetting and the influence of a linear potential are discussed.",

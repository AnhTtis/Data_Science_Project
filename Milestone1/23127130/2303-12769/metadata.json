    "abstract": "A simple prediction of the well-known unification model of active galactic nuclei is that a sample of sources should exhibit an anti-correlation between the solid angle of the dusty torus and of the ionization cone (as the sum of them shall equal 4$π$), which however has never been detected. In this work, we analyze the correlation between [OIII] 5007 narrow emission line equivalent width and $L_{\\rm IR}(λ)/L_{\\rm bol}$ for a large sample of luminous quasars. For the first time, we detect a clear intrinsic anti-correlation between them, which immediately verifies the torus/ionization-cone geometry in luminous quasars. More interestingly, the anti-correlation significantly weakens with increasing wavelength from $\\sim$ 2 to 12 $μ$m, and disappears at $\\sim$ 12 $μ$m. Simulations show a cool dust component (in addition to equatorial torus) with its strength positively correlating with the solid angle of the ionization cone is required to explain the observations. This shows that the polar dust seen in nearby active galaxies also exists in luminous quasars, with its contribution to total dust emission increasing with $λ$ (from $\\sim$ 2 to 12 $μ$m) and reaching between 39%-62% (model dependent) at rest frame 12 $μ$m. Our findings provide a unique approach to map the otherwise spatially unresolvable inner structure of quasars.",

abstract = {Bandit based methods for tree search have recently gained popularity when applied to huge trees, e.g. in the game of go [6]. Their efficient exploration of the tree enables to return rapidly a good value, and improve precision if more time is provided. The UCT algorithm [8], a tree search method based on Upper Confidence Bounds (UCB) [2], is believed to adapt locally to the effective smoothness of the tree. However, we show that UCT is "over-optimistic" in some sense, leading to a worst-case regret that may be very poor. We propose alternative bandit algorithms for tree search. First, a modification of UCT using a confidence sequence that scales exponentially in the horizon depth is analyzed. We then consider Flat-UCB performed on the leaves and provide a finite regret bound with high probability. Then, we introduce and analyze a Bandit Algorithm for Smooth Trees (BAST) which takes into account actual smoothness of the rewards for performing efficient "cuts" of sub-optimal branches with high confidence. Finally, we present an incremental tree expansion which applies when the full tree is too big (possibly infinite) to be entirely represented and show that with high probability, only the optimal branches are indefinitely developed. We illustrate these methods on a global optimization problem of a continuous function, given noisy values.},

  abstract = 	 {Autonomous agents need to make decisions in a sequential manner, under partially observable environment, and in consideration of how other agents behave. In critical situations, such decisions need to be made in real time for example to avoid collisions and recover to safe conditions. We propose a technique of tree search where a deterministic and pessimistic scenario is used after a specified depth. Because there is no branching with the deterministic scenario, the proposed technique allows us to take into account the events that can occur far ahead in the future. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is demonstrated in Pommerman, a multi-agent environment used in a NeurIPS 2018 competition, where the agents that implement the proposed technique have won the first and third places.}

address = {Arlington, Virginia, USA},
abstract = {Bandit based methods for tree search have recently gained popularity when applied to huge trees, e.g. in the game of go [6]. Their efficient exploration of the tree enables to return rapidly a good value, and improve precision if more time is provided. The UCT algorithm [8], a tree search method based on Upper Confidence Bounds (UCB) [2], is believed to adapt locally to the effective smoothness of the tree. However, we show that UCT is "over-optimistic" in some sense, leading to a worst-case regret that may be very poor. We propose alternative bandit algorithms for tree search. First, a modification of UCT using a confidence sequence that scales exponentially in the horizon depth is analyzed. We then consider Flat-UCB performed on the leaves and provide a finite regret bound with high probability. Then, we introduce and analyze a Bandit Algorithm for Smooth Trees (BAST) which takes into account actual smoothness of the rewards for performing efficient "cuts" of sub-optimal branches with high confidence. Finally, we present an incremental tree expansion which applies when the full tree is too big (possibly infinite) to be entirely represented and show that with high probability, only the optimal branches are indefinitely developed. We illustrate these methods on a global optimization problem of a continuous function, given noisy values.},

  abstract = 	 {Autonomous agents need to make decisions in a sequential manner, under partially observable environment, and in consideration of how other agents behave. In critical situations, such decisions need to be made in real time for example to avoid collisions and recover to safe conditions. We propose a technique of tree search where a deterministic and pessimistic scenario is used after a specified depth. Because there is no branching with the deterministic scenario, the proposed technique allows us to take into account the events that can occur far ahead in the future. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is demonstrated in Pommerman, a multi-agent environment used in a NeurIPS 2018 competition, where the agents that implement the proposed technique have won the first and third places.}

  abstract  = {This paper addresses the problem of maintaining persistence in coordinated tasks performed by a team of autonomous robots. We introduce a dedicated team of charging robots to service a team of primary working robots. Given that the trajectories of the working robots are known within a planning interval, the objective is to plan routes for the charging robots such that they rendezvous with and recharge all working robots to guarantee their continuous operation. To this end, the working robot trajectories are discretized to form a finite set of recharging points at which rendezvous can occur. The problem is formulated as a directed acyclic graph with vertex partitions containing sets of charging points for each working robot. Solutions consist of paths through the graph for each of the charging robots. The problem is shown to be NP-hard and a mixed integer linear program formulation is presented and solved for small problem instances. Finally, it is shown that while the optimal solution is not computationally feasible for large problem sizes, it is possible to graphically transform the single charging robot problem to a Traveling Salesman Problem, for which existing heuristic and approximation algorithms can be applied. Simulation results are presented for both single and multiple charging robot scenarios.},

Consider a set of deployed “task robots” that request resources (e.g. batteries) from a distribution center, which can deploy “delivery robots” to fulfill those requests. We address the scheduling problem with multiple incoming time-bound requests from the task robots. Our proposed framework incorporates priorities on working robots that can be adjusted by a human operator during scheduling, since mission priorities can change over time. The framework allows a relaxed delivery schedule when available resources are scant and permits dynamic re-routing of delivery robots. The problem is posed as a variant of the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows, and solved as a Mixed Integer Quadratic Program using a branch and bound based solver. We present the specific case of a battery distribution system and validate the results in simulation.},

Given a set of tasks to perform, we formulate a general Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem aiming at minimizing the overall execution time while optimizing the quality of the executed tasks as well as human and robotic workload. Different skills of the agents, both human and robotic, are taken into account and human operators are enabled to either directly execute tasks or play supervisory roles; moreover, multiple manipulators can tightly collaborate if required to carry out a task. Finally, as realistic in human contexts, human parameters are assumed to vary over time, e.g., due to increasing human level of fatigue. Therefore, online monitoring is required and re-allocation is performed if needed. Simulations in a realistic scenario with two manipulators and a human operator performing an assembly task validate the effectiveness of the approach.},

  abstract = {In the multi-agent pathfinding problem (MAPF) we are given a set of agents each with respective start and goal positions. The task is to find paths for all agents while avoiding collisions. Most previous work on solving this problem optimally has treated the individual agents as a single ‘joint agent’ and then applied single-agent search variants of the A* algorithm. In this paper we present the Conflict Based Search (CBS) a new optimal multi-agent pathfinding algorithm. CBS is a two-level algorithm that does not convert the problem into the single ‘joint agent’ model. At the high level, a search is performed on a Conflict Tree (CT) which is a tree based on conflicts between individual agents. Each node in the CT represents a set of constraints on the motion of the agents. At the low level, fast single-agent searches are performed to satisfy the constraints imposed by the high level CT node. In many cases this two-level formulation enables CBS to examine fewer states than A* while still maintaining optimality. We analyze CBS and show its benefits and drawbacks. Additionally we present the Meta-Agent CBS (MA-CBS) algorithm. MA-CBS is a generalization of CBS. Unlike basic CBS, MA-CBS is not restricted to single-agent searches at the low level. Instead, MA-CBS allows agents to be merged into small groups of joint agents. This mitigates some of the drawbacks of basic CBS and further improves performance. In fact, MA-CBS is a framework that can be built on top of any optimal and complete MAPF solver in order to enhance its performance. Experimental results on various problems show a speedup of up to an order of magnitude over previous approaches.},

By explicitly sharing information between multi-hop neighbors, the decentralized controller achieves a higher quality of coverage when compared to classical approaches that do not communicate and leverage only local information available to each robot.

Though the global state space size and action space size are exponential in n, we impose local dependence structures and focus on local policies that only depend on local states, and we propose a method that finds nearly optimal local policies in polynomial time (in n) when the dependence structure is a one directional tree. The algorithm builds on approximated reward functions which are evaluated using locally truncated Markov process. Further, under some special conditions, we prove that the gap between the approximated reward function and the true reward function is decaying exponentially fast as the length of the truncated Markov process gets longer. The intuition behind this is that under some assumptions, the effect of agent interactions decays exponentially in the distance between agents, which we term "fast decaying property". Results in this paper are our preliminary steps towards designing efficient reinforcement learning algorithms with optimality guarantees in large multi-agent MDP problems whose state (action) space size is exponentially large in n.},

Yet, it is far from obvious what information is crucial to the task at hand, and how and when it must be shared among robots. To side-step these issues and move beyond hand-crafted heuristics, we propose a combined model that automatically synthesizes local communication and decision-making policies for robots navigating in constrained workspaces. Our architecture is composed of a convolutional neural network (CNN) that extracts adequate features from local observations, and a graph neural network (GNN) that communicates these features among robots. We train the model to imitate an expert algorithm, and use the resulting model online in decentralized planning involving only local communication and local observations. We evaluate our method in simulations by navigating teams of robots to their destinations in 2D cluttered workspaces. We measure the success rates and sum of costs over the planned paths. The results show a performance close to that of our expert algorithm, demonstrating the validity of our approach. In particular, we show our model's capability to generalize to previously unseen cases (involving larger environments and larger robot teams).},

While drawing motivation from recent graph learning methods that learn to solve combinatorial optimization (CO) problems such as multi-Traveling Salesman and Vehicle Routing Problems using RL, this paper seeks to provide better performance (compared to non-learning methods) and important scalability (compared to existing learning architectures) for the stated class of MRTA problems. The proposed neural architecture, called Capsule Attention-based Mechanism or CapAM acts as the policy network, and includes three main components: 1) an encoder: a Capsule Network based node embedding model to represent each task as a learnable feature vector; 2) a decoder: an attention-based model to facilitate a sequential output; and 3) context: that encodes the states of the mission and the robots. To train the CapAM model, the policy-gradient method based on REINFORCE is used. When evaluated over unseen scenar-ios, CapAM demonstrates better task completion performance and > 10 times faster decision-making compared to standard non-learning based online MRTA methods. CapAM's advantage in generalizability, and scalability to test problems of size larger than those used in training, are also successfully demonstrated in comparison to a popular approach for learning to solve CO problems, namely the purely attention mechanism.},

Traditionally, the problem of scheduling agents to complete tasks with temporal and spatial constraints has been approached either with exact algorithms, which are computationally intractable for large-scale, dynamic coordination, or approximate methods that require domain experts to craft heuristics for each application. We seek to overcome the limitations of these conventional methods by developing a novel graph attention network-based scheduler to automatically learn features of scheduling problems towards generating high-quality solutions. To learn effective policies for combinatorial optimization problems, we combine imitation learning, which makes use of expert demonstration on small problems, with graph neural networks, in a non-parametric framework, to allow for fast, near-optimal scheduling of robot teams with various sizes, while generalizing to large, unseen problems. Experimental results showed that our network-based policy was able to find high-quality solutions for ~90% of the testing problems involving scheduling 2-5 robots and up to 100 tasks, which significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art, approximate methods. Those results were achieved with affordable computation cost and up to 100× less computation time compared to exact solvers.},

The models are designed for computing optimal solutions offline, but can be easily adapted for a distributed online approach. Our simulations show that it is possible to achieve 98% decrease in computational time relative to the previous state-of-the-art.

  abstract    = {Multi-robot systems require efficient and accurate planning in order to perform mission-critical tasks. This paper introduces a mixed-integer linear programming solution to coordinate multiple heterogenenous robots for detecting and controlling multiple regions of interest in an unknown environment. The objective function contains four basic requirements of a multi-robot system serving this purpose: control regions of interest, provide communication between robots, control maximum area and detect regions of interest. Our solution defines optimum locations of robots in order to maximize the objective function while efficiently satisfying some constraints such as avoiding obstacles and staying within the speed capabilities of the robots. We implemented and tested our approach under realistic scenarios. We showed various extensions to objective function and constraints to show the flexibility of mixed-integer linear programming formulation.},

However, most current approaches use minor variants of a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), which applies a convolution to the communication graph formed by the multi-agent system. In this paper, we investigate whether the performance and generalization of GCNs can be improved upon. We introduce ModGNN, a decentralized framework which serves as a generalization of GCNs, providing more flexibility. To test our hypothesis, we evaluate an implementation of ModGNN against several baselines in the multi-agent flocking problem. We perform an ablation analysis to show that the most important component of our framework is one that does not exist in a GCN. By varying the number of agents, we also demonstrate that an application-agnostic implementation of ModGNN possesses an improved ability to generalize to new environments.},

  abstractnote = {&lt;p&gt;In large-scale multi-agent systems, the large number of agents and complex game relationship cause great difficulty for policy learning. Therefore, simplifying the learning process is an important research issue. In many multi-agent systems, the interactions between agents often happen locally, which means that agents neither need to coordinate with all other agents nor need to coordinate with others all the time. Traditional methods attempt to use pre-defined rules to capture the interaction relationship between agents. However, the methods cannot be directly used in a large-scale environment due to the difficulty of transforming the complex interactions between agents into rules. In this paper, we model the relationship between agents by a complete graph and propose a novel game abstraction mechanism based on two-stage attention network (G2ANet), which can indicate whether there is an interaction between two agents and the importance of the interaction. We integrate this detection mechanism into graph neural network-based multi-agent reinforcement learning for conducting game abstraction and propose two novel learning algorithms GA-Comm and GA-AC. We conduct experiments in Traffic Junction and Predator-Prey. The results indicate that the proposed methods can simplify the learning process and meanwhile get better asymptotic performance compared with state-of-the-art algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;},

We propose a novel collaborative prediction unit (CoPU), which aggregates the predictions from multiple collaborative predictors according to a collaborative graph. Each collaborative predictor is trained to predict the agent status by integrating the impact of another agent. The edge weights of the collaborative graph reflect the importance of each predictor. The collaborative graph is adjusted online by multiplicative update, which can be motivated by minimizing an explicit objective. With this objective, we also conduct regret analysis to indicate that, along with training, our CoPU achieves similar performance with the best individual collaborative predictor in hindsight. This theoretical interpretability distinguishes our method from many other graph networks. To progressively refine predictions, multiple CoPUs are stacked to form a collaborative graph neural network. Extensive experiments are conducted on three tasks: online simulated trajectory prediction, online human motion prediction, and online traffic speed prediction, and our methods outperform state-of-the-art works on the three tasks by 28.6%, 17.4%, and 21.0% on average, respectively; in addition, the proposed CoGNNs have lower average time costs in one online training/testing iteration than most previous methods.},

Having established previously that these objectives are distinct and NP-hard to optimize, in this paper, we focus on efficient algorithmic solutions for solving these optimal MPP problems. Toward this goal, we first establish a one-to-one solution mapping between MPP and a special type of multiflow network. Based on this equivalence and integer linear programming (ILP), we design novel and complete algorithms for optimizing over each of the four objectives. In particular, our exact algorithm for computing optimal makespan solutions is a first that is capable of solving extremely challenging problems with robot-vertex ratios as high as 100%. Then, we further improve the computational performance of these exact algorithms through the introduction of principled heuristics, at the expense of slight optimality loss. The combination of ILP model based algorithms and the heuristics proves to be highly effective, allowing the computation of 1.x-optimal solutions for problems containing hundreds of robots, densely populated in the environment, often in just seconds.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates a dynamic scheduling problem within a job shop robotic cell, wherein multiple robotic arms are responsible for material handling in a U-shaped arrangement. Each robotic arm has access to specific workstations based on their distance in the cell layout. Therefore, a part may need to be exchanged between several robots according to its process plan. For this purpose, intermediate buffers are positioned between each pair of consecutive robots. Due to the dynamic nature of the problem, new jobs arrive at unpredictable times, which in turn necessitates rescheduling taking the system’s current state into account. To tackle this problem, firstly, a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model is devised. Secondly, three distinct Speed-up Constraints (SCs) derived from the problem’s inherent characteristics are designed and implemented to accelerate the MILP model’s solving procedure. Afterward, the problem is formulated using Constraint Programming (CP) approach. The performance of the CP model and the MILP model in presence of all possible combinations of the SCs are evaluated and compared through solving various random instances. Next, an analysis is performed on the buffers’ pick-up criterion and how it is affected by the problem’s size. Besides, the impact of changes in the robots’ speed on the productivity of the cell is assessed. Finally, the extent to which the rescheduling priority affects the output of the model is studied.},

Problems of this form can be shown to arise in many areas, from motion planning of autonomous vehicles to optimal control of hybrid systems. The price for such a wide applicability is the complexity of this problem, which is easily seen to be NP-hard.

The objective of the allocation is to minimize the total cost, that is, the sum of the travel costs of all robots for visiting all targets. We show that finding an optimal allocation is an NP-hard problem, even in known environments. The main contribution of this paper is PRIM ALLOCATION, a simple and fast approximate algorithm for allocating targets to robots which provably computes allocations whose total cost is at most twice as large as the optimal total cost. We then cast PRIM ALLOCATION in terms of a multi-round single-item auction where robots bid on targets, which allow for a decentralized implementation. To the best of our knowledge, PRIM ALLOCATION is the first auction-based allocation algorithm that provides a guarantee on the quality of its allocations. Our experimental results in a multi-robot simulator demonstrate that PRIM ALLOCATION is fast and results in close-to-optimal allocations despite its simplicity and decentralized nature. In particular, it needs an order of magnitude fewer bids than a computationally intensive allocation algorithm based on combinatorial auctions, yet its allocations are at least as good.},

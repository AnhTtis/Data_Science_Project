    "abstract": "Criteria for a good voting system have been given particularly careful scrutiny in recent years, with general agreement that the core values are fair results, voter power and choice, and local representation.\n  This paper reexamines the basic ideas of three widely used voting systems, the Single Transferable Vote, List-PR, and Mixed Member Proportional (MMP); and evaluates their performance in terms of both principles and practice.\n  It looks particularly closely at proportionality, examining three aspects:n linearity, the threshold for representation and the threshold for gaining a majority.\n  As regards local representation, an important question is how to design multi-member constituencies. It will be argued that using constituencies based on natural demographic boundaries (such as local government areas) can combine better local representation with stability over time and better proportionality.\n  STV is unsurprisingly best for voter empowerment and choice, as those are parts of its basic idea.\n  Broad conclusions are summarised within the Summary on page 1 of the paper.\n  The paper makes use of recent public availability of large preferential voting data sets for STV elections, making possible new analyses of how STV functions in practice, and of voter behaviour, particularly examining how voters' second preferences relate to their first preferences.",

    "abstract": "In the current work, we present the influence of finite volume and magnetic field on the thermodynamic properties of isospin asymmetric quark matter using the Polyakov loop extended chiral SU(3) quark mean field (PCQMF) model at finite chemical potential and temperature. Within the PCQMF model, we use the scalar and vector field values in mean-field approximation to obtain the thermodynamic properties: pressure density, entropy density and energy density. The susceptibilities of conserved charges for strongly interacting matter for different system sizes as well as for different values of the magnetic field have been studied. A sizable shift in phase boundary towards the higher values of quark chemical potential ($μ_q$) and temperature (T) has been observed for decreasing values of system volume as well as an opposite shift towards lower temperature and quark chemical potential for increasing magnetic field. We observe an enhancement in fluctuations of conserved charges in the regime of the transition temperature. These studies may have a significant role in understanding the thermodynamic observables extracted from heavy-ion collisions data.",

    "abstract": "We explore a variety of composite topological structures that arise from the spontaneous breaking of $SO(10)$ to $SU(3)_c \\times U(1)_{em}$ via one of its maximal subgroups $SU(5) \\times U(1)_χ$, $SU(4)_c \\times SU(2)_L \\times SU(2)_R$, and $SU(5) \\times U(1)_X$ (also known as flipped $SU(5)$). They include i) a network of $\\mathbb{Z}$ strings which develop monopoles and turn into necklaces with the structure of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ strings, ii) dumbbells connecting two different types of monopoles, or monopoles and antimonpoles, iii) starfish-like configurations, iv) polypole configurations, and v) walls bounded by a necklace. We display these structures both before and after the electroweak breaking. The appearance of these composite structures in the early universe and their astrophysical implications including gravitational wave emission would depend on the symmetry breaking patterns and scales, and the nature of the associated phase transitions.",

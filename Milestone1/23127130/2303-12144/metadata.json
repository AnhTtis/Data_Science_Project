    "abstract": "The Weyl semimetal CeAlGe is a promising material to study non-trivial topologies in real and momentum space due to the presence of a topological magnetic phase. Our results at ambient pressure show that the electronic properties of CeAlGe are extremely sensitive to small stoichiometric variations. In particular, the topological Hall effect (THE) present in CeAlGe is absent in some samples of almost identical chemical composition. The application of external pressure favors the antiferromagnetic ground state. It also induces a THE, where it was not visible at ambient pressure. Furthermore, a small pressure is sufficient to drive the single region of the THE in magnetic fields into two different ones. Our results reveal an extreme sensitivity of the electronic properties of CeAlGe to tiny changes in its chemical composition, leading to a high tunability by external stimuli. We can relate this sensitivity to a shift of the Fermi level and to domain walls.",

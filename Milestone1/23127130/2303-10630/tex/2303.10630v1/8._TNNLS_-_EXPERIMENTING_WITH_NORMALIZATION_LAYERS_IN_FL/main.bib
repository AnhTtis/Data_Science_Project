title = {The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): A Practical Guide},
year = {2017},
isbn = {3319579584},
publisher = {Springer Publishing Company, Incorporated},
edition = {1st},
abstract = {This book provides expert advice on the practical implementation of the European Unions General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and systematically analyses its various provisions. Examples, tables, a checklist etc. showcase the practical consequences of the new legislation. The handbook examines the GDPRs scope of application, the organizational and material requirements for data protection, the rights of data subjects, the role of the Supervisory Authorities, enforcement and fines under the GDPR, and national particularities. In addition, it supplies a brief outlook on the legal consequences for seminal data processing areas, such as Cloud Computing, Big Data and the Internet of Things. Adopted in 2016, the General Data Protection Regulation will come into force in May 2018. It provides for numerous new and intensified data protection obligations, as well as a significant increase in fines (up to 20 million euros). As a result, not only companies located within the European Union will have to change their approach to data security; due to the GDPRs broad, transnational scope of application, it will affect numerous companies worldwide.}

        abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) is becoming popular in different industrial sectors where data access is critical for security, privacy and the economic value of data itself. Unlike traditional machine learning, where all the data must be globally gathered for analysis, FL makes it possible to extract knowledge from data distributed across different organizations that can be coupled with different Machine Learning paradigms. In this work, we replicate, using Federated Learning, the analysis of a pooled dataset (with AdaBoost) that has been used to define the PRAISE score, which is today among the most accurate scores to evaluate the risk of a second acute myocardial infarction. We show that thanks to the extended-OpenFL framework, which implements AdaBoost.F, we can train a federated PRAISE model that exhibits comparable accuracy and recall as the centralised model. We achieved F1 and F2 scores which are consistently comparable to the PRAISE score study of a 16-parties federation but within an order of magnitude less time.},

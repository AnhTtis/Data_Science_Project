  abstract = {We extend recent results on the exact hydrodynamics of a system of diffusive active particles displaying a motility-induced phase separation to account for typical fluctuations of the dynamical fields. By calculating correlation functions exactly in the homogeneous phase, we find that two macroscopic length scales develop in the system. The first is related to the diffusive length of the particles and the other to the collective behavior of the particles. The latter diverges as the critical point is approached. Our results show that the critical behavior of the model in one dimension belongs to the universality class of a mean-field Ising model, both for static and dynamic properties, when the thermodynamic limit is taken in a specified manner. The results are compared to the critical behavior exhibited by the ABC model. In particular, we find that in contrast to the ABC model the density large deviation function, at its Gaussian approximation, does not contain algebraically decaying interactions but is of a finite, macroscopic, extent which is dictated by the diverging correlation length.},

Although the initial condition is not a steady state, the distribution of the current satisfies a symmetry very reminiscent of the fluctuation theorem. We show how the equations of the MFT can be solved in the case of non-interacting particles. The symmetry of these equations can be used to deduce the distribution of the current for several other models, from its knowledge (Derrida and Gerschenfeld in J. Stat.

We discuss several applications which have stimulated interest in the model such as shaken granular gases and network dynamics; we also discuss how the model may be used as a coarse-grained description of driven phase-separating systems. A useful property of the zerorange process is that the steady state has a factorized form. We show how this form enables one to analyse in detail condensation transitions, wherein a finite fraction of particles accumulate at a single site. We review condensation transitions in homogeneous and heterogeneous systems and also summarize recent progress in understanding the dynamics of condensation. We then turn to several generalizations which also, under certain specified conditions, share the property of a factorized steady state. These include several species of particles; hop rates which depend on both the departure and the destination sites; continuous masses; parallel discrete-time updating; non-conservation of particles and sites.},

Techniques used in the study of the interacting quantum fields can then be employed, and systematic approximations can be obtained. It is also possible to carry out a "charge normalization" eliminating the nonlinear coupling in favor of a dimensionless parameter which measures the deviation from Gaussian behavior. No assumptions of spatial or time homogeneity or of small deviation from equilibrium enter. It is shown that previously inferred renormalization schemes for homogeneous systems were incomplete or erroneous.

The two classes are determined by the sign of compressibility of effective fluid, obtained by mapping the MFT into an inviscid hydrodynamics. An example of the elliptic class is the symmetric simple exclusion process, where, for some initial conditions, we can solve the effective hydrodynamics exactly. This leads to a super-Gaussian extreme current statistics conjectured by Derrida and Gerschenfeld [J. Stat. Phys. 137, 978 (2009)] and yields the optimal path of the system.

The particles do not pass each other and the displacement of each individual particle is sub-diffusive. We analyse a simple realization of this single file diffusion problem where one dimensional Brownian point particles interact only by hard-core repulsion. We show that the large deviation function which characterizes the displacement of a tracer at large time can be computed via a mapping to a problem of non-interacting Brownian particles. We confirm recently obtained results of the one time distribution of the displacement and show how to extend them to the multi-time correlations. The probability distribution of the tracer position depends on whether we take annealed or quenched averages. In the quenched case we notice an exact relation between the distribution of the tracer and the distribution of the current. This relation is in fact much more general and would be valid for arbitrary single file diffusion. It allows in particular to get the full statistics of the tracer position for the symmetric simple exclusion process (SSEP) at density 1/2 in the quenched case.},

We map the master equation onto an evolution equation in a Fock space where the dynamics are given by a quantum Hamiltonian (continuous time) or a transfer matrix (discrete time). Using non-Abelian symmetries of these operators we derive duality relations, expressing the time evolution of a given initial configuration in terms of correlation functions of simpler dual processes. Particularly simple results are obtained for the time evolution of the density profile. As a special case we show that for any SU(2) symmetric system the two-point and three-point density correlation functions in the N-particle steady state can be computed from the probability distribution of a single particle moving in the same environment. We apply our results to various models, among them partial exclusion, a simple diffusion-reaction system, and the two-dimensional six-vertex model with space-dependent vertex weights. For a random distribution of the vertex weights one obtains a version of the random-barrier model describing diffusion of particles in disordered media. We derive exact expressions for the averaged two-point density correlation functions in the presence of weak, correlated disorder.},

The evolution of coarse-grained variables is governed by stochastic hydrodynamic equations in the limit of small noise. As such it is amenable to a treatment formally equal to the semiclassical limit of quantum mechanics, which reduces the problem of finding the full distribution functions to the solution of a set of Hamiltonian equations. It is in general not possible to solve such equations explicitly, but for an interesting set of problems (the driven symmetric exclusion process and the Kipnis–Marchioro–Presutti model) it can be done by a sequence of remarkable changes of variables. We show that at the bottom of this ‘miracle’ is the surprising fact that these models can be taken through a non-local transformation into isolated systems satisfying detailed balance, with probability distribution given by the Gibbs–Boltzmann measure. This procedure can in fact also be used to obtain an elegant solution of the much simpler problem of non-interacting particles diffusing in a one-dimensional potential, again using a transformation that maps the driven problem into an undriven one.},

When the system is taken out of equilibrium by a boundary-drive, current fluctuations, at least for a particular family of diffusive systems, display the same universal features as in equilibrium. To achieve this result, we exploit a mapping between the fluctuations in a boundary-driven nonequilibrium system and those in its equilibrium counterpart. Finally, we prove, for two well-studied processes, namely the Simple Symmetric Exclusion Process and the Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti model for heat conduction, that the distribution of the current out of equilibrium can be deduced from the distribution in equilibrium. Thus, for these two microscopic models, the mapping between the out-of-equilibrium setting and the equilibrium one is exact.},

If $\mu$ is the initial distribution of the system, let $\mu_t$ be the distribution at time $t$. The main results determine the limiting behavior of $\mu_t$ as $t \rightarrow \infty$ for simple choices of $\mu$. For example, it is shown that if $\mu$ is the pointmass on the configuration in which all sites to the left of the origin are occupied, while those to the right are vacant, then the system converges as $t \rightarrow \infty$ to the product measure on $\{0, 1\}^Z$ with density $1/2$. For the proof, an auxiliary process is introduced which is of interest in its own right. It is a process on the positive integers in which particles move according to the simple exclusion process, but with the additional feature that there can be creation and destruction of particles at one.

Following the approach of Derrida et al. (J. Phys. A 26(7), 1493, 1993) it was shown by Grosskinsky (2004) that these correlations can be described by means of a matrix product representation.

In the bulk, the particles exchange rate is equal to 1. In the hydrostatic scenario, we obtain three different linear profiles, depending on the value of the parameter $\theta$; in the hydrodynamic scenario, we obtain that the time evolution of the spatial density of particles, in the diffusive scaling, is given by the weak solution of the heat equation, with boundary conditions that depend on $\theta$. If $\theta$∈ (0 , 1) , we get Dirichlet boundary conditions, (which is the same behavior if $\theta$= 0 , see Farf{\'{a}}n in Hydrostatics, statical and dynamical large deviations of boundary driven gradient symmetric exclusion processes, 2008); if $\theta$= 1 , we get Robin boundary conditions; and, if $\theta$∈ (1 , ∞) , we get Neumann boundary conditions.},

The hydrodynamic limit is given by the heat equation with non-linear Robin boundary conditions or Neumann boundary conditions, the latter being in the case when the reservoirs are too slow. The proof goes through the entropy method of Guo, Papanicolaou and Varadhan. We also derive the hydrostatic limit for this model, whose proof is based on the method developed by Landim and Tsunoda.

We consider an Ising ferromagnet endowed with zero-temperature spin-flip dynamics and examine the evolution of the Ising quadrant, namely the spin configuration when the minority phase initially occupies one quadrant while the majority phase occupies the three remaining quadrants. The two phases are then always separated by a single interface, which generically recedes into the minority phase in a self-similar diffusive manner. The area of the invaded region grows (on average) linearly with time and exhibits non-trivial fluctuations. We map the interface separating the two phases onto the one-dimensional symmetric simple exclusion process and utilize this isomorphism to compute basic cumulants of the area. First, we determine the variance via an exact microscopic analysis (the Bethe ansatz). Then we turn to a continuum treatment by recasting the underlying exclusion process into the framework of the macroscopic fluctuation theory. This provides a systematic way of analyzing the statistics of the invaded area and allows us to determine the asymptotic behaviors of the first four cumulants of the area.},

We characterize the process by the heat transferred to the right of a specified point x = X by time T,  and study the full probability distribution . The particular case of X = 0 has been recently solved by Bettelheim et al (2022 Phys. Rev. Lett.  128 130602).

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York. Single-file diffusion is a one-dimensional interacting infinite-particle system in which the order of particles never changes. An intriguing feature of single-file diffusion is that the mean-square displacement of a tagged particle exhibits an anomalously slow sub-diffusive growth. We study the full statistics of the displacement using a macroscopic fluctuation theory. For the simplest single-file system of impenetrable Brownian particles we compute the large deviation function and provide an independent verification using an exact solution based on the microscopic dynamics. For an arbitrary single-file system, we apply perturbation techniques and derive an explicit formula for the variance in terms of the transport coefficients. The same method also allows us to compute the fourth cumulant of the tagged particle displacement for the symmetric exclusion process.},

    "abstract": "We study Jánossy densities of a randomly thinned Airy kernel determinantal point process. We prove that they can be expressed in terms of solutions to the Stark and cylindrical Korteweg-de Vries equations; these solutions are Darboux tranformations of the simpler ones related to the gap probability of the same thinned Airy point process. Moreover, we prove that the associated wave functions satisfy a variation of Amir-Corwin-Quastel's integro-differential Painlevé II equation. Finally, we derive tail asymptotics for the relevant solutions to the cylindrical Korteweg-de Vries equation and show that they decompose asymptotically into a superposition of simpler solutions.",

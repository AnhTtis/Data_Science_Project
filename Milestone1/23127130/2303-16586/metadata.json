    "abstract": "It is argued, as a working hypothesis, that \"normal\" and dark matter interactions can only be T and CP violating. One way to implement this idea is to consider that time reversal in dark matter is implemented, not by an antiunitary operator, but by a unitary operator. It is shown how this occurs naturally in the context of complex spacetime with an extended symmetry group.",

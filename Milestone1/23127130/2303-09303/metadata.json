    "abstract": "We study value semigroups associated to germs of maps $\\mathbb{C} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}^3$ with fixed ramification profiles in a distinguished point. We then apply our analysis to deduce that Severi varieties of unicuspidal rational fixed-degree curves with value semigroup ${\\rm S}$ in $\\mathbb{P}^3$ are often reducible when ${\\rm S}$ is either 1) the semigroup of a generic cusp whose ramification profile is a supersymmetric triple; or 2) a supersymmetric semigroup with ramification profile given by a supersymmetric triple. In doing so, we uncover new connections with additive combinatorics and number theory.",

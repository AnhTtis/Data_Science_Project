    "abstract": "Novel \"quasi two dimensional\" typically layered (semi) metals offer a unique opportunity to control the density and even the topology of the electronic matter. Along with doping and gate voltage, a robust tuning is achieved by application of the hydrostatic pressure. In Weyl semi - metals the tilt of the dispersion relation cones, k , increases with pressure, so that one is able to reach type II k > 1 starting from the more conventional type I Weyl semi - metals k < 1. The microscopic theory of such a transition is constructed. It is found that upon increasing pressure the I to II transition occurs in two continuous steps. In the first step the cones of opposite chirality coalesce so that the chiral symmetry is restored, while the second transition to the Fermi surface extending throughout the Brillouin zone occurs at higher pressures. Flattening of the band leads to profound changes in Coulomb screening. Superconductivity observed recently in wide range of pressure and chemical composition in Weyl semi-metals of both types. The phonon theory of pairing including the Coulomb repulsion for a layered material is constructed and applied to recent extensive experiments on HfTe5.",

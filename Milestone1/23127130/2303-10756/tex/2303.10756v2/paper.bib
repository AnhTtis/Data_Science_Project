Such misalignment results in insufficient capacity planning or product-development resource allocation, thus delaying projects. For this field study, Alcatel's R\&D effectiveness team investigated products and solutions within Alcatel's different business groups. We extracted in the first part of the study four seemingly successful product life-cycle management techniques. Then we quantitatively evaluated the impacts of these techniques on those projects. Results verified that when used in parallel, the four techniques can indeed significantly reduce delays},

Governments and organizations have been challenged to identify their environmental impacts to address environmental sustainability issues. A promising, yet under-studied in this context, theme of information systems (IS) literature that has the potential to help with identifying, quantifying and managing environmental impacts is business process management (BPM). With its focus on continual process performance improvement, the capacity of BPM to contribute to Environmental Sustainability (ES) needs to be further explored. Yet, contributions from the BPM research community and the impact of these contributions appear to be fragmented. In this paper, we present a systematic literature review to explore BPM contributions to ES, with a focus on environmental performance indicators (EPIs) as well as relevant organizational factors related to ES and BPM. In doing so, we identify and explore ‘Green BPM’ contributions and suggest ways to advance BPM research in the context of ES.},

	abstract = {The significantly expanded and updated new edition of a widely used text on reinforcement learning, one of the most active research areas in artificial intelligence.Reinforcement learning, one of the most active research areas in artificial intelligence, is a computational approach to learning whereby an agent tries to maximize the total amount of reward it receives while interacting with a complex, uncertain environment. In Reinforcement Learning, Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto provide a clear and simple account of the field's key ideas and algorithms. This second edition has been significantly expanded and updated, presenting new topics and updating coverage of other topics.Like the first edition, this second edition focuses on core online learning algorithms, with the more mathematical material set off in shaded boxes. Part I covers as much of reinforcement learning as possible without going beyond the tabular case for which exact solutions can be found. Many algorithms presented in this part are new to the second edition, including UCB, Expected Sarsa, and Double Learning. Part II extends these ideas to function approximation, with new sections on such topics as artificial neural networks and the Fourier basis, and offers expanded treatment of off-policy learning and policy-gradient methods. Part III has new chapters on reinforcement learning's relationships to psychology and neuroscience, as well as an updated case-studies chapter including AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero, Atari game playing, and IBM Watson's wagering strategy. The final chapter discusses the future societal impacts of reinforcement learning.},

	volume = {7},
	issn = {2050-3121, 2050-3121},
	shorttitle = {Grounded theory research},
	abstract = {Background: Grounded theory is a well-known methodology employed in many research studies. Qualitative and quantitative data generation techniques can be used in a grounded theory study. Grounded theory sets out to discover or construct theory from data, systematically obtained and analysed using comparative analysis. While grounded theory is inherently flexible, it is a complex methodology. Thus, novice researchers strive to understand the discourse and the practical application of grounded theory concepts and processes.
Objective: The aim of this article is to provide a contemporary research framework suitable to inform a grounded theory study.
Result: This article provides an overview of grounded theory illustrated through a graphic representation of the processes and methods employed in conducting research using this methodology. The framework is presented as a diagrammatic representation of a research design and acts as a visual guide for the novice grounded theory researcher. Discussion: As grounded theory is not a linear process, the framework illustrates the interplay between the essential grounded theory methods and iterative and comparative actions involved. Each of the essential methods and processes that underpin grounded theory are defined in this article.
Conclusion: Rather than an engagement in philosophical discussion or a debate of the different genres that can be used in grounded theory, this article illustrates how a framework for a research study design can be used to guide and inform the novice nurse researcher undertaking a study using grounded theory. Research findings and recommendations can contribute to policy or knowledge development, service provision and can reform thinking to initiate change in the substantive area of inquiry.},

            Process mining is an active research domain and has been applied to understand and improve business processes. While significant research has been conducted on the development and improvement of algorithms, evidence on the application of process mining in organizations has been far more limited. In particular, there is limited understanding of the opportunities and challenges of using process mining in organizations. Such an understanding has the potential to guide research by highlighting barriers for process mining adoption and, thus, can contribute to successful process mining initiatives in practice. In this respect, the paper provides a holistic view of opportunities and challenges for process mining in organizations identified in a Delphi study with 40 international experts from academia and industry. Besides proposing a set of 30 opportunities and 32 challenges, the paper conveys insights into the comparative relevance of individual items, as well as differences in the perceived relevance between academics and practitioners. Therefore, the study contributes to the future development of process mining, both as a research field and regarding its application in organizations.},

Our first objective was to create empirically generated lists of risk factors for both domestically- and offshore-outsourced projects. Our second objective was to compare these two contexts: how do the risk factors change and which ones are most important in each. To address these objectives, we conducted two Delphi surveys to identify the important risk factors from a client perspective, in domestic and offshore settings. We qualitatively compared the results of the surveys to identify similarities and differences across their risk profiles. We identified three types of risks: those that appeared in both contexts; those that appeared in both but were exacerbated in the offshore context; and those that were unique to the offshore context. Our findings suggested that traditional project management risks were important in both contexts; however, the offshore context seemed to be more vulnerable to some traditional risks as well as factors that were unique to it.},

Controlled experiments embody the best scientific design for establishing a causal relationship between changes and their influence on user-observable behavior. We provide a practical guide to conducting online experiments, where end-users can help guide the development of features. Our experience indicates that significant learning and return-on-investment (ROI) are seen when development teams listen to their customers, not to the Highest Paid Person’s Opinion (HiPPO). We provide several examples of controlled experiments with surprising results. We review the important ingredients of running controlled experiments, and discuss their limitations (both technical and organizational). We focus on several areas that are critical to experimentation, including statistical power, sample size, and techniques for variance reduction. We describe common architectures for experimentation systems and analyze their advantages and disadvantages. We evaluate randomization and hashing techniques, which we show are not as simple in practice as is often assumed. Controlled experiments typically generate large amounts of data, which can be analyzed using data mining techniques to gain deeper understanding of the factors influencing the outcome of interest, leading to new hypotheses and creating a virtuous cycle of improvements. Organizations that embrace controlled experiments with clear evaluation criteria can evolve their systems with automated optimizations and real-time analyses. Based on our extensive practical experience with multiple systems and organizations, we share key lessons that will help practitioners in running trustworthy controlled experiments.},

Process workers may start executing a process differently in order to adjust to changes in workload, season, guidelines or regulations for example. Early detection of business process changes based on their event logs – also known as business process drift detection – enables analysts to identify and act upon changes that may otherwise affect process performance. Previous methods for business process drift detection are based on an exploration of a potentially large feature space and in some cases they require users to manually identify the specific features that characterize the drift. Depending on the explored feature set, these methods may miss certain types of changes. This paper proposes a fully automated and statistically grounded method for detecting process drift. The core idea is to perform statistical tests over the distributions of runs observed in two consecutive time windows. By adaptively sizing the window, the method strikes a trade-off between classification accuracy and drift detection delay. A validation on synthetic and real-life logs shows that the method accurately detects typical change patterns and scales up to the extent that it works for online drift detection.},

Design/methodology/approach Within the empirical investigation, the level of BPO maturity was measured in the 19 organizations of the power supply business. The survey was focused on the top, middle and lower managers. As a measuring instrument, a questionnaire for the extended concept of process orientation with nine elements was used. Findings The results of the BPO measurement show that, despite this long-standing preoccupation with processes, certified management system and the computerization of operations, process maturity is not high. Particularly the lowest score for information technology represents a surprise. Practical implications This research makes significant contributions to the literature and above all to scholars and practitioners who work professionally in this field and will find useful guidance for a better understanding of applying BPO and maturity models. Social implications One important reason for performing the maturity measurement in the power supply business is the importance of its activities for the operation and development and environmental impact of the whole of Slovenian society. Originality/value Presented research is the first one which considers the BPO maturity in the Slovenian power supply business and therefore contributes to understanding of the “intangible factors” which have impact on the introduction of business process management and BPO.},

	abstract = {Proactive process adaptation can prevent and mitigate upcoming problems during process execution by using predictions about how an ongoing case will unfold. There is an important trade-oﬀ with respect to these predictions: Earlier predictions leave more time for adaptations than later predictions, but earlier predictions typically exhibit a lower accuracy than later predictions, because not much information about the ongoing case is available. An emerging solution to address this trade-oﬀ is to continuously generate predictions and only trigger proactive adaptations when prediction reliability is greater than a predeﬁned threshold. However, a good threshold is not known a priori. One solution is to empirically determine the threshold using a subset of the training data. While an empirical threshold may be optimal for the training data used and the given cost structure, such a threshold may not be optimal over time due to non-stationarity of process environments, data, and cost structures. Here, we use online reinforcement learning as an alternative solution to learn when to trigger proactive process adaptations based on the predictions and their reliability at run time. Experimental results for three public data sets indicate that our approach may on average lead to 12.2\% lower process execution costs compared to empirical thresholding.},

Method: We carried out a systematic literature review, to collect existing proposals related to our research work. Then, in close collaboration with business experts from the Hospital General de Ciudad Real (HGCR), Spain, and following design science principles, we developed the methods and artifacts described in this paper, which were validated by means of a case study.
Results: We deﬁned an improvement process extending the BP lifecycle with measurement and improvement activities, integrating an execution measurement model comprising a set of execution measures. Moreover, we developed a plug-in for the ProM framework to visualize the measurement results as a proof-of-concept prototype. The case study with the HGCR has shown its feasibility.
Conclusions: Our improvement vision, based on BPs realized by services and on measurement of their execution, in conjunction with a systematic approach to integrate the detected improvements, provides useful guidance to organizations.},

	abstract = {Adoption of business process improvement strategies are now a concern of most organisations. Organisations are still facing challenges and finding transient solutions to immediate problems. The misalignment between IT solutions and organisational aspects evolves across space and time showing discrepancies. Unfortunately, existing business process approaches are not according with continuous business process improvement involving business stakeholders. Considering this limitation in well-known Business Process (BP) methodologies, this paper presents a comparative study of some approaches and introduces agility in the Business Process and Practice Alignment Methodology (BPPAM). Our intention is to present observed problems in existing approaches and introduce agility in our proposal to address features, like the alignment between daily work practices and business process descriptions, in a simple and agile way.},

The results of the survey shed some light on challenges and perspectives around event log generation, as well as on the relationship between process models and process execution, and derive challenges for event log generation from it. The responses indicate that particularly relevant challenges exist around data integration and quality, and that process mining can benefit from a systematic integration with more traditional and wide-spread business intelligence approaches.},

They are typically assigned tasks that are strategically important and highly complex. They rarely meet in person, conducting almost all of their interaction and decision making using communications technology. Although they play an increasingly important role in multinational organizations, little systematic is known about their dynamics or effectiveness. This study built a grounded theory of global virtual team processes and performance over time. We built a template based on Adaptive Structuration Theory (DeSanctis and Poole 1994) to guide our research, and we conducted a case study, observing three global virtual teams over a period of 21 months. Data were gathered using multiple methods, and qualitative methods were used to analyze them and generate a theory of global virtual team dynamics and effectiveness. First, we propose that effective global virtual team interaction comprises a series of communication incidents, each conﬁgured by aspects of the team’s structural and process elements. Effective outcomes were associated with a ﬁt among an interaction incident’s form, decision process, and complexity. Second, effective global virtual teams sequence these incidents to generate a deep rhythm of regular face-toface incidents interspersed with less intensive, shorter incidents using various media. These two insights are discussed with respect to other literature and are elaborated upon in several propositions. Implications for research and practice are also outlined.},

	abstract = {Context
The number of maturity models proposed in the area of Business Process Management (BPM) has increased considerably in the last decade. However, there are a number of challenges, such as the limited empirical studies on their validation and a limited extent of actionable properties of these models in guiding their application. These challenges hinder the widespread usage of the maturity models in the BPM field.
Objective
In order to better understand the state of the research on business process maturity models (BPMMs) and identify opportunities for future research, we conducted a systematic literature review.
Method
We searched the studies between the years 1990 and 2014 in established digital libraries to identify empirical studies of BPMMs by focusing on their development, validation, and application. We targeted studies on generic models proposed for business process maturity, business process management or orientation maturity, and selected 61 studies out of 2899 retrieved initially.
Results
We found that despite that many BPMMs were proposed in the last decade, the level of empirical evidence that reveals the validity and usefulness of these models is scarce.
Conclusion
The current state of research on BPM maturity is in its early phases, and academic literature lacks methodical applications of many mainstream BPMMs that have been proposed. Future research should be directed towards: (1) reconciling existing models with a strong emphasis on prescriptive properties, (2) conducting empirical studies to demonstrate the validity and usefulness of BPMMs, and (3) separating the assessment method used to evaluate the maturity level from the maturity model which acts as the reference framework for the assessment.},

While there is a strong culture of medical ethics in healthcare applications, AI-based Healthcare Applications (AIHA) are challenging the existing ethics and regulatory frameworks. This scoping review explores how ethics frameworks have been implemented in AIHA, how these implementations have been evaluated and whether they have been successful. AI specific ethics frameworks in healthcare appear to have a limited adoption and they are mostly used in conjunction with other ethics frameworks. The operationalisation of ethics frameworks is a complex endeavour with challenges at different levels: ethics principles, design, technology, organisational, and regulatory. Strategies identified in this review are proactive, contextual, technological, checklist, organisational and/or evidence-based approaches. While interdisciplinary approaches show promises, how an ethics framework is implemented in an AI-based Healthcare Application is not widely reported, and there is a need for transparency for trustworthy AI.},

Second, hospitals may have an incentive to reduce the quality of care. I analyze the role of hospital ownership on patient selection and quality of care by comparing private nonprofit and public hospitals. The analysis is performed by using unique hospital admission data for cardiovascular procedures in Norway, covering the period from 1999 to 2006. Matching techniques are applied to control for patient heterogeneity. The econometric analyses are based on binary probit and ordinary least squares regression models. The results indicate that private nonprofit hospitals have specialized in certain procedures. These hospitals are also more likely to admit low-severity patients for some procedures. The association between quality of care and hospital ownership is mixed since private nonprofit hospitals both offer shorter waiting time and shorter length of stay.},

We use repeated shocks to a profitable service in the market for hospital-based medical care to test for cross-subsidization of unprofitable services. Using patient-level data from general short-term hospitals in Arizona and Colorado before and after entry by cardiac specialty hospitals, we study how incumbent hospitals adjusted their provision of three uncontested services that are widely considered to be unprofitable. We estimate that the hospitals most exposed to entry reduced their provision of psychiatric, substance-abuse, and trauma care services at a rate of about one uncontested-service admission for every four cardiac admissions they stood to lose. Although entry by single-specialty hospitals may adversely affect the provision of unprofitable uncontested services, these findings warrant further evaluation of service-line cross-subsidization as a means to finance them.},

It seemed to be that only hard coding was the appropriate solution for business process implementations. As a consequence in classical literature about business process management (BPM), the focus was mainly on the management aspects of BPM, less on aspects regarding an effective and efﬁcient implementation methodology. This has changed signiﬁcantly since the advent of BPMN 2.0 (Business Process Model and Notation) in early 2011. BPMN is a graphical notation for modeling business processes in an easy to understand manner. Because the BPMN standard had the process execution in mind when it was designed, it allows for a new way of implementing business processes, on which the process-driven approach (PDA) is based. This approach has been applied in a huge project at SAP SE since 2015 comprising more than 200 business-critical processes. In order to get an impression about the power of the process-driven approach for really complex business process implementation scenarios, this chapter explains the basics about the process-driven approach and shares experiences made during the execution of the project.},

	abstract = {There are several models and approaches to implementing BPR and an organization should seek to adopt 
depending on their organizations’ needs and capabilities. An organization seeking to undertake BPR must 
therefore examine some key elements of its organization structure beforehand for maximum gains in the BPR 
implementation. Three such analysis methodologies are functional coupling, architectural triad and the 
restructuring framework. This study aimed to establish whether The Wrigley Company East Africa achieved 
operational competitive advantage by implementing Business Process Reengineering (BPR). In addition, the 
study aimed to explain the possible reasons why The Wrigley Company may have succeeded or failed to attain 
competitive advantage by implementing BPR. The study intended to determine if there was improvement in the 
competitive measures of cost management, customer service, quality and productivity. The study also looked at 
the BPR implementation process by seeking to understand if documented key success factors for BPR 
implementation were followed and if the success or failure to achieve competitive advantage can be explained 
by the key drivers for success in BPR implementation. The research was conducted by collecting primary data 
from the employees of the Wrigley Company. An online questionnaire based on the competitive measures and 
BPR implementation key success factors was used to collect the data from which certain findings were deduced. 
It was established that The Wrigley Company gained competitive advantage by implementing BPR. It was also 
established that it adopted the BPR practises that are critical for successful implementation. From the research 
findings, the researcher recommends that organizations seeking to undertake BPR initiatives should first 
understand the need for changing the organization. They will then need to ensure that they adopt the key 
success factors for BPR implementation and based on the findings of this research, competitive advantage will 
be attained.},

The five‐year corporate transformation programme focuses on employee communications, the redesign of work, recruitment and reward processes and the introduction of consumer research‐based national quality standards. The bank was rewarded for its efforts, coming top for three consecutive years in the Which? service quality surveys and, according to its own data, which contributed to a rise in customer satisfaction and customer retention at a time of declining employee satisfaction. Future developments in service quality segmentation and a working definition of service quality are proposed.},

Business process modelling enables a common understanding and analysis of a business process. A process model can provide a comprehensive understanding of a process. An enterprise can be analysed and integrated through its business processes. Hence the importance of correctly modelling its business processes. Using the right model involves taking into account the purpose of the analysis and, knowledge of the available process modelling techniques and tools. The number of references on business modelling is huge, thus making it very time consuming to get an overview and understand many of the concepts and vocabulary involved. The primary concern of this paper is to make that job easier, i.e. review business process modelling literature and describe the main process modelling techniques. Also a framework for classifying business process-modelling techniques according to their purpose is proposed and discussed.},

	abstract = {Purpose Even today still many business process change (BPC) initiatives fail and cause high overruns for organizations undergoing BPC initiatives. It is therefore important that BPC practitioners and researchers understand the risks inherent in BPC projects, and that they adapt their risk management processes to account for and mitigate these risks. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to investigate which emergent risks matter in BPC project. Design/methodology/approach The authors adopted case survey methodology and investigated data from 130 case studies to show the nature and magnitude of relationships between organizational support risks, volatility risks, and BPC project and process performance. Findings The results show that organizational support risks influence both the overall BPC project performance and process performance. Whereas, volatility risks influence project performance but appear to have no direct impact on the process performance. Both organizational support risks and volatility risks show influence on project management practices. Research limitations/implications The study show several limitations that might be assigned to the case survey methodology, such as use of secondary data or publication bias. Practical implications The authors provide considerable support which emergent risks matter in BPC projects. Originality/value The contribution of this study takes several forms. It fills a gap in the literature concerning emergent risk factors inherent in BPC projects. The authors provided theoretical explanation of the effects of emergent risks on BPC project and process performance. And lastly, the authors have demonstrated the usefulness of case survey methodology in BPC research.},

Method: To perform the analysis a literature survey and a comparison of existing (business process model) repository technology is performed.
Result: The results of the state of the art analysis are twofold. First, a framework for business process model repositories is presented, which consists of a management model and a reference architecture. The management model lists the functionality that can be provided and the reference architecture presents the components that provide that functionality. Second, an analysis is presented of the extent to which existing business process model repositories implement the functionality from the framework.
Conclusion: The results presented in the paper are valuable as a comprehensive overview of business process model repository functionality. In addition they form a basis for a future research agenda. We conclude that existing repositories focus on traditional functionality rather than exploiting the full potential of information management tools, thus we show that there is a strong basis for further research.},

However, the degree of automation currently achieved cannot support the level of reactivity and adaptation demanded by businesses.

In particular, we present SENTINEL a Semantic Business Process Monitoring tool that advances the state of the art in BAM by making extensive use of semantic technologies in order to support the integration and derivation of business level knowledge out of low-level audit trails generated by IT systems.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel approach to real-time business process monitoring for prediction of abnormal termination. Existing real-time monitoring approaches are difficult to use proactively, owing to unobserved data from gradual process executions. To improve the utility and effectiveness of real-time monitoring, we derived a KNNI (k nearest neighbor imputation)-based LOF (local outlier factor) prediction algorithm. In each monitoring period of an ongoing process instance, the proposed algorithm estimates the distribution of LOF values and the probability of abnormal termination when the ongoing instance is terminated, which estimations are conducted periodically over entire periods. Thereby, we can probabilistically predict outcomes based on the current progress. In experiments conducted with an example scenario, we showed that the proposed predictors can reflect real-time progress and provide opportunities for proactive prevention of abnormal termination by means of an early alarm. With the proposed method, abnormal termination of an ongoing instance can be predicted, before its actual occurrence, enabling process managers to obtain insights into real-time progress and undertake proactive prevention of probable risks, rather than merely reactive correction of risk eventualities.},

Specifically, given two process models, we seek to determine if they are behaviorally equivalent, and if not, we seek to describe their differences in terms of behavioral relations captured in one model but not in the other. The proposed solution is based on a translation from process models to Asymmetric Event Structures (AES). A naïve version of this translation suffers from two limitations. First, it produces redundant difference diagnostic statements because an AES may contain unnecessary event duplication. Second, it is not applicable to process models with cycles. To tackle the first limitation, we propose a technique to reduce event duplication in an AES while preserving canonicity. For the second limitation, we propose a notion of unfolding that captures all possible causes of each event in a cycle. From there we derive an AES where repeated events are distinguished from non-repeated ones and that allows us to diagnose differences in terms of repetition and causal relations in one model but not in the other.},

Hence, model comparison is generally considered as a critical factor for the acceptance and success of model-driven development approaches.

Local independence, expected value true scores, and nondeterministic functions of observed variables are three types of definitions for latent variables. These definitions are reviewed and an alternative “sample realizations” definition is presented. Another section briefly describes identification, latent variable indeterminancy, and other properties common to models with latent variables. The paper then reviews the role of latent variables in multiple regression, probit and logistic regression, factor analysis, latent curve models, item response theory, latent class analysis, and structural equation models. Though these application areas are diverse, the paper highlights the similarities as well as the differences in the manner in which the latent variables are defined and used. It concludes with an evaluation of the different definitions of latent variables and their properties.},

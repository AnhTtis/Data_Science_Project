    "abstract": "Regulators and browsers increasingly restrict user tracking to protect users privacy online. Such restrictions also have economic implications for publishers that rely on selling advertising space to finance their business, including their content. According to an analysis of 42 million ad impressions related to 111 publishers, when user tracking is unavailable, the raw price paid to publishers for ad impressions decreases by about -60%. After controlling for differences in users, advertisers, and publishers, this decrease remains substantial, at -18%. More than 90% of the publishers realize lower prices when prevented from engaging in user tracking. Publishers offering broad content, such as news websites, suffer more from user tracking restrictions than publishers with thematically focused content. Collecting a users browsing history, perceived as generally intrusive to most users, generates negligible value for publishers. These results affirm the prediction that ensuring user privacy online has substantial costs for online publishers; this article offers suggestions to reduce these costs.",

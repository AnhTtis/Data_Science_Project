    "abstract": "This paper presents a funnel synthesis algorithm for computing controlled invariant sets and feedback control gains around a given nominal trajectory for dynamical systems with locally Lipschitz nonlinearities and bounded disturbances. The resulting funnel synthesis problem involves a differential linear matrix inequality (DLMI) whose solution satisfies a Lyapunov condition that implies invariance and attractivity properties. Due to these properties, the proposed method can balance maximization of initial invariant funnel size, i.e., size of the funnel entry, and minimization of the size of the attractive funnel for disturbance attenuation. To solve the resulting funnel synthesis problem with the DLMI as one of the problem constraints, we employ a numerical optimal control approach that uses a multiple shooting method to convert the problem into a finite dimensional semidefinite programming problem. This framework avoids the need for piecewise linear system matrices and funnel parameters, which are typically assumed in recent related work. We illustrate the proposed funnel synthesis method with a numerical example.",

Pyomo provides a capability that is commonly associated with algebraic modeling languages such as {AMPL}, {AIMMS}, and {GAMS}. In contrast, Pyomo’s modeling objects are embedded within a full-featured high-level programming language with a rich set of supporting libraries. Pyomo leverages the capabilities of the Coopr software library, which together with Pyomo is part of {IBM}’s {COIN}-{OR} open-source initiative for operations research software. Coopr integrates Python packages for defining optimizers, modeling optimization applications, and managing computational experiments. Numerous examples illustrating advanced scripting applications are provided.},

In many applications such as healthcare monitoring or intrusion detection, early classification is crucial to prompt intervention. In this work, we learn sequence classifiers that favour early classification from an evolving observation trace. While many state-of-the-art sequence classifiers are neural networks, and in particular {LSTMs}, our classifiers take the form of finite state automata and are learned via discrete optimization. Our automata-based classifiers are interpretable---supporting explanation, counterfactual reasoning, and human-in-the-loop modification---and have strong empirical performance. Experiments over a suite of goal recognition and behaviour classification datasets show our learned automata-based classifiers to have comparable test performance to {LSTM}-based classifiers, with the added advantage of
  being interpretable.},

These directives contain both high-level goals like “Rinse off a mug and place it in the coffee maker.” and low-level language instructions like “Walk to the coffee maker on the right.” {ALFRED} tasks are more complex in terms of sequence length, action space, and language than existing vision- and-language task datasets. We show that a baseline model based on recent embodied vision-and-language tasks performs poorly on {ALFRED}, suggesting that there is significant room for developing innovative grounded visual language understanding models with this benchmark.},

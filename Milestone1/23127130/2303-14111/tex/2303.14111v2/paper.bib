  abstract     = {Logs have been widely adopted in software system development and maintenance because of the rich system runtime information they contain. In recent years, the increase of software size and complexity leads to the rapid growth of the volume of logs. To handle these large volumes of logs efficiently and effectively, a line of research focuses on intelligent log analytics powered by {AI} (artificial intelligence) techniques. However, only a small fraction of these techniques have reached successful deployment in industry because of the lack of public log datasets and necessary benchmarking upon them. To fill this significant gap between academia and industry and also facilitate more research on {AI}-powered log analytics, we have collected and organized loghub, a large collection of log datasets. In particular, loghub provides 17 real-world log datasets collected from a wide range of systems, including distributed systems, supercomputers, operating systems, mobile systems, server applications, and standalone software. In this paper, we summarize the statistics of these datasets, introduce some practical log usage scenarios, and present a case study on anomaly detection to demonstrate how loghub facilitates the research and practice in this field. Up to the time of this paper writing, loghub datasets have been downloaded over 15,000 times by more than 380 organizations from both industry and academia.},

In many applications such as healthcare monitoring or intrusion detection, early classification is crucial to prompt intervention. In this work, we learn sequence classifiers that favour early classification from an evolving observation trace. While many state-of-the-art sequence classifiers are neural networks, and in particular {LSTMs}, our classifiers take the form of finite state automata and are learned via discrete optimization. Our automata-based classifiers are interpretable---supporting explanation, counterfactual reasoning, and human-in-the-loop modification---and have strong empirical performance. Experiments over a suite of goal recognition and behaviour classification datasets show our learned automata-based classifiers to have comparable test performance to {LSTM}-based classifiers, with the added advantage of
  being interpretable.},

These directives contain both high-level goals like “Rinse off a mug and place it in the coffee maker.” and low-level language instructions like “Walk to the coffee maker on the right.” {ALFRED} tasks are more complex in terms of sequence length, action space, and language than existing vision- and-language task datasets.

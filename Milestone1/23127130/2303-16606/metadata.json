    "abstract": "In this work we study the potential of the lepton flavor ratios $R_{K}^{τμ} \\equiv Γ(B \\to K τ^+ τ^-)/ Γ(B \\to K μ^+ μ^-)$ and $ R_{K^{*}}^{τμ} \\equiv Γ(B \\to K^* τ^+ τ^-)/ Γ(B \\to K^* μ^+ μ^-)$ to probe lepton flavor universality (LFU) violation in $τ-μ$ sector. We show that these ratios can deviate from their SM values even if the new physics couplings are universal in nature, i.e., having equal couplings to $e$, $μ$ and $τ$ leptons. Therefore, in order to utilize these observables to probe LFU violation, we need to compare the allowed range of $R_{K^{(*)}}^{τμ}$ for class of solutions with only universal couplings to leptons and solutions having both universal and non-universal components. For the current $b \\to s \\ell \\ell$ ($\\ell=e,\\,μ$) data, we find that these two classes of solutions can be discriminated provided the measured value of $ R_{K^{*}}^{τμ} $ is greater than the SM prediction.",

    "abstract": "We study dynamical dark energy models within Einstein's theory by means of matter perturbations and the growth index $γ$. Within four-dimensional General Relativity, we assume that dark energy does not cluster, and we adopt a linear ansatz for the growth index to investigate its impact on the deceleration parameter, $q$, and on the dark energy equation-of-state parameter, $w$. Following this approach, we identify a relationship between $q_0$ (today's value of $q$) and $γ$, which to the best of our knowledge is new. For $w(z)$, we find that in most of the cases considered it crosses the -1 line (quintom) ending at a present day value $w_0 > -1$. Furthermore, we show that an analytic expression for $w(z)$ may be obtained in the form of order (4,4) (or higher) Pad{é} parameterizations.",

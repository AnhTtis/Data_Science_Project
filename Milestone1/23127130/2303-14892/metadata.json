    "abstract": "We construct an $(\\infty,1)$-functor that takes each smooth $G$-manifold with corners $M$ to the space of equivariant smooth $h$-cobordisms ${\\mathcal H}_{\\mathrm{Diff}}(M)$. We also give a stable analogue ${\\mathcal H}^{\\mathcal U}_{\\mathrm{Diff}}(M)$ where the manifolds are stabilized with respect to representation discs. The functor structure is subtle to construct, and relies on several new ideas. In the non-equivariant case $G=e$, our $(\\infty,1)$-functor agrees with previous constructions of the smooth $h$-cobordism space as a functor to the homotopy category.",

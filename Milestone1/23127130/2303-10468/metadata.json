    "abstract": "Spin waves that can propagate in normal and superconducting metals are investigated. Unlike normal metals, the velocity of spin waves becomes temperature-dependent in a superconductor. The low frequency spin waves survive within the narrow region below the superconducting transition temperature. At low temperatures the high frequency waves alone can propagate with an additional damping due to pair-breaking.",

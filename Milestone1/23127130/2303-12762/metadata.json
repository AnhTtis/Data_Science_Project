    "abstract": "Diffusive memristors continue to receive tremendous interest due to their ability to emulate biological neurons and thus aid the development of bio-inspired computation technology. A major issue with the diffusive memristor is the inability to reliably control the formation of the conduction filaments which affects both the device functionality and reproducibility of regimes after each application of voltage. Here we investigate the effect of gamma radiation on the electrical properties of the diffusive memristors based on metallic nanoparticles in dielectric matrix. Our experiments show that after exposing to radiation, the memristors demonstrate much sharper (and less noisy) hysteresis in the current-voltage characteristics while preserving the same low- and high-resistive states as in the pristine samples. Additionally, the radiation lowers both threshold and hold voltages that correspond to onset of low- and high- resistive states, respectively. The proposed mechanism involves radiation-induced defects in the silica matrix which help to establish dominant pathways for nanoparticles to form conduction filaments. Our findings suggest an efficient way to enhance working characteristics of diffusive memristors and to improve their reproducibility.",

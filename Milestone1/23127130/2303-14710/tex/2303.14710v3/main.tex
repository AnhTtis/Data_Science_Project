  \begin{abstract}
    Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are directed graphs in which there is no path
    from a vertex to itself.
    DAGs are an omnipresent data structure in computer science and the problem
    of counting the DAGs of given number of vertices and to sample them
    uniformly at random has been solved respectively in the 70's and the 00's.
    In this paper, we propose to explore a new variation of this model where
    DAGs are endowed with an independent ordering of the out-edges of each
    vertex, thus allowing to model a wide range of existing data structures.

    We provide efficient algorithms for sampling objects of this new class, both
    with or without control on the number of edges, and obtain an asymptotic
    equivalent of their number.
    We also show the applicability of our method by providing an effective
    algorithm for the random generation of classical labelled DAGs with a
    prescribed number of vertices and edges, based on a similar approach.
    This is the first known algorithm for sampling labelled DAGs with full
    control on the number of edges, and it meets a need in terms of
    applications, that had already been acknowledged in the literature.

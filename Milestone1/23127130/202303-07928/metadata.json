    "abstract": "The exponential and Cayley map on SE(3) are the prevailing coordinate maps\nused in Lie group integration schemes for rigid body and flexible body systems.\nSuch geometric integrators are the Munthe-Kaas and generalized-alpha schemes,\nwhich involve the differential and its directional derivative of the respective\ncoordinate map. Relevant closed form expressions, which were reported over the\nlast two decades, are scattered in the literature, and some are reported\nwithout proof. This paper provides a reference summarizing all relevant closed\nform relations along with the relevant proofs. including the right-trivialized\ndifferential of the exponential and Cayley map and their directional\nderivatives (resembling the Hessian). The latter gives rise to an implicit\ngeneralized-alpha scheme for rigid/flexible multibody systems in terms of the\nCayley map with improved computational efficiency.",

In this paper, we have proposed the \gls{SysName}.
We have designed the \gls{Protocol}, established the channel model, and  analyzed the \acrshort{crlb} of the system.
Then, we have designed an \acrshort{and} beamforming optimization algorithm for the \acrshort{crlb} minimization, which handles the large number of beamforming variables efficiently.
Simulation results have shown that firstly, the proposed algorithm achieves lower average \acrshort{crlb} with less computational time compared with benchmark algorithms.
Secondly, the \acrshort{and} beamforming obtained by the proposed algorithm results in $42\%$ lower \acrshort{mse} of positioning, which leads to $82\%$ less communication capacity loss, compared with the benchmark directional beamforming.

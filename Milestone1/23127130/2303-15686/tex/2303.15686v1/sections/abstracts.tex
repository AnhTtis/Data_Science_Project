\begin{abstract}
Metamaterial-based reconfigurable holographic surfaces~(\acrshort{rhs}s) have been proposed as novel cost-efficient antenna arrays, which are promising for improving the positioning and communication performance of \acrfull{isac} systems.
However, due to the high frequency selectivity of the metamaterial elements, RHSs face challenges in supporting ultra-wide bandwidth~(UWB), which significantly limits the positioning precision.
In this paper, to avoid the physical limitations of UWB RHS while enhancing the performance of RHS-based ISAC systems, we propose a \acrfull{mb} \acrshort{rhs} based \acrshort{isac} system.
We analyze its positioning precision and propose an efficient algorithm to optimize the large number of variables in analog and digital beamforming.
Through comparison with benchmark results, simulation results verify the efficiency of our proposed system and algorithm, and show that the system achieves $42\%$ less positioning error, which reduces $82\%$ communication capacity loss.

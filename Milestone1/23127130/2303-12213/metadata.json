    "abstract": "A foundational problem in topology and data is to determine the topological type (e.g. the persistent homology groups) of the superlevel sets $\\mathcal{L}(a)=f^{-1}[e^{-a},\\infty)$ of a sum of Gaussian kernels $f(x)=\\sum_i a_i \\exp(-\\lVert x-x_i\\rVert^2/2h^2)$ for $\\{x_i\\}\\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$. In this paper, we show that each $\\mathcal{L}(a)$ coincides with the union of a certain power-shifted covering by balls, whose centers range over a closed subspace of the convex hull $\\mathcal{L}(a)\\subset conv(\\{x_i\\})$. We then present an explicit homotopy equivalence $p:\\mathcal{L}(a)\\rightarrow \\mathcal{S}(a)$, realizing $\\mathcal{S}(a)$ as a continuous version of the alpha shape. This leads to a prescription for modeling noisy point clouds by density-weighted alpha complexes which, in addition to computing persistent homology, give rise to refined geometric models. In order to compute alpha complexes in higher dimension, we used a recent algorithm due to the present authors based on the duality principle.",

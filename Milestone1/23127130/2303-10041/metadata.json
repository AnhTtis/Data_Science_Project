    "abstract": "Following our previous work on `perpendicular' boundary conditions, we show that transmission conditions \\[ f'(0-)=α(f(0+)-f(0-)), \\quad f'(0+)=β(f(0+)-f(0-)),\\] describing so-called snapping out Brownian motions on the real line, are in a sense complementary to the transmission conditions \\[f(0-)=-f(0+), \\quad f''(0+) =αf'(0-)+βf'(0+). \\] As an application of the analysis leading to this result, we also provide a deeper semigroup-theoretic insight into the theorem saying that as the coefficients $α$ and $β$ tend to infinity but their ratio remains constant, the snapping-out Brownian motions converge to a skew Brownian motion. In particular, the transmission condition \\[ αf'(0+) = βf'(0-), \\] that characterizes the skew Brownian motion turns out to be complementary to \\[ f(0-) = - f(0+), βf'(0+)=- αf'(0-). \\]",

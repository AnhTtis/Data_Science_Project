abstract = {We develop a new efficient simulation scheme for sampling two families of tilted stable distributions: exponential tilted stable (ETS) and gamma tilted stable (GTS) distributions. Our scheme is based on two-dimensional single rejection. For the ETS family, its complexity is uniformly bounded over all ranges of parameters. This new algorithm outperforms all existing schemes. In particular, it is more efficient than the well-known double rejection scheme, which is the only algorithm with uniformly bounded complexity that we can find in the current literature. Beside the ETS family, our scheme is also flexible to be further extended for generating the GTS family, which cannot easily be done by extending the double rejection scheme. Our algorithms are straightforward to implement, and numerical experiments and tests are conducted to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency.},

The algorithms, which generalize Kanter's method, are uniformly fast over all choices of the tilting and stable parameters. The key to the solution is a new distribution which we call Zolotarev's distribution. We also present a novel double rejection method that is useful whenever densities have an integral representation involving an auxiliary variable.},

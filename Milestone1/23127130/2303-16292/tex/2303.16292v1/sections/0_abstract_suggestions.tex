% Explainable AI (XAI) has established itself as an important component for interactive systems that are driven by machine learning models.
% With Augmented Reality (AR) getting closer to everyday living, AI can empower a wide range of intelligent AR experience.
% It is foreseeable that XAI will play an increasingly important role in AR for end-users.
% However, it remains unclear how to design effective XAI experiences in AR.
% In this paper, we propose XAIR, a design framework that addresses \emph{when}, \emph{what}, and \emph{how} to provide explanations.
% The framework is initially derived from summarizing multidisciplinary literature. It is further developed based on a large-scale survey with over 500 end users and three iterative workshops with 12 experts from diverse backgrounds.
% We then evaluate the usability of XAIR by a user study with 10 designers and researchers to employ XAIR and propose designs for real-life AR scenarios.
% Finally, we implement a real-time intelligent AR system that instantiates the design examples, and evaluate the effectiveness of XAIR via another study with 12 end users.
% Our studies receive positive feedback about XAIR, indicating good usability and effectiveness.
% We conclude our paper with multiple example applications of XAIR and a series of discussions.
% We envision that our framework can provide meaningful guidelines and inspire future researchers and designers for XAI design in AR.


Breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence (AI) push the boundaries of what interactive systems can achieve.
As AI gets more prevalent in everyday life, there is increased scrutiny in AI-driven processes.
Explainable AI (XAI) can give users more control, by making AI processes interpretable and accountable.
At the same time Augmented Reality (AR) is getting more popular, a context-sensitive medium where AI can play a crucial role to empower a variety of experiences.
In this paper, we propose XAIR, a design framework that addresses \emph{when}, \emph{what}, and \emph{how} to provide explanations in AR systems.
The framework is initially derived from summarizing multidisciplinary literature.
We conduct a series of studies to inform design decisions of the framework.
First, we survey potential end-users to analyse important component

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we propose XAIR, a framework to guide XAI design in AR.
Based on a literature review of multiple domains, we identified the problem space using three main questions, \ie when to explain, what to explain, and how to explain.
We combined the results from a large-scale survey with over 500 end-users (Study 1) and iterative workshops with 12 experts (Study 2) to develop XAIR and a set of eight design guidelines.
Using our framework, we walked through example XAI designs in two everyday AR scenarios.
To evaluate XAIR's utility, we conducted a study with 10 designers (Study 3).
The study revealed that designers found XAIR to be a helpful, comprehensive reference that could inspire new design thoughts and provide a backup of designer intuitions.
Moreover, to demonstrate the effectiveness of XAIR, we instantiated two design examples in a real-time AR system and conducted another user study with 12 end-users (Study 4). The results indicated excellent usability of the AR system.
XAIR can thus help future designers and researchers achieve effective XAI designs in AR and help them explore new design opportunities.

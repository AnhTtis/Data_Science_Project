% Explainable AI (XAI) has established itself as an important component for interactive systems that are driven by machine learning models.
% With Augmented Reality (AR) getting closer to everyday living, AI can empower a wide range of intelligent AR experience.
% It is foreseeable that XAI will play an increasingly important role in AR for end-users.
% However, it remains unclear how to design effective XAI experiences in AR.
% In this paper, we propose XAIR, a design framework that addresses \emph{when}, \emph{what}, and \emph{how} to provide explanations.
% The framework is initially derived from summarizing multidisciplinary literature. It is further developed based on a large-scale survey with over 500 end users and three iterative workshops with 12 experts from diverse backgrounds.
% We then evaluate the utility of XAIR by a user study with 10 designers and researchers to employ XAIR and propose designs for real-life AR scenarios.
% Finally, we implement a real-time intelligent AR system that instantiates the design examples, and evaluate the effectiveness of XAIR via another study with 12 end users.
% Our studies receive positive feedback about XAIR, indicating good utility and effectiveness.
% We conclude our paper with multiple example applications of XAIR and a series of discussions.
% We envision that our framework can provide meaningful guidelines and inspire future researchers and designers for XAI design in AR.

% Explainable AI (XAI) has established itself as an important component of interactive systems driven by AI algorithms.
% With Augmented Reality (AR) becoming more integrated in daily lives, the role of XAI is also essential in AR, where end-users will interact with various intelligent services.
% However, the way to design effective XAI experiences in various AR contexts is unclear.
% We propose XAIR, a design framework that addresses \emph{when}, \emph{what}, and \emph{how} to provide explanations of AI outcomes in AR.
% The framework was developed based on a multi-disciplinary literature review across XAI and HCI, a large-scale survey asking 500+ end-users' preferences, and three consecutive workshops with 12 experts to collect their insights.
% The utility of XAIR was then verified via a study with 10 designers. A second study with 12 end-users and an AR system was conducted to demonstrate XAIR's effectiveness.
% XAIR can provide guidelines for designers, inspiring them to identify new design opportunities and achieve effective XAI designs in AR.

Explainable AI (XAI) has established itself as an important component of AI-driven interactive systems.
With Augmented Reality (AR) becoming more integrated in daily lives, the role of XAI also becomes essential in AR because end-users will frequently interact with intelligent services. 
However, it is unclear how to design effective XAI experiences for AR. 
We propose XAIR, a design framework that addresses \textit{when}, \textit{what}, and \textit{how} to provide explanations of AI output in AR.
The framework was based on a multi-disciplinary literature review of XAI and HCI research, a large-scale survey probing 500+ end-users’ preferences for AR-based explanations, and three workshops with 12 experts collecting their insights about XAI design in AR. 
XAIR's utility and effectiveness was verified via a study with 10 designers and another study with 12 end-users.
XAIR can provide guidelines for designers, inspiring them to identify new design opportunities and achieve effective XAI designs in AR.

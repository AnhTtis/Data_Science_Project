	abstract = {Depression is a prevailing issue and is an increasing problem in many people’s lives. Without observable diagnostic cri- teria, the signs of depression may go unnoticed, resulting in high demand for detecting depression in advance automati- cally. This paper tackles the challenging problem of forecast- ing severely depressed moods based on self-reported histo- ries. Despite the large amount of research on understanding individual moods including depression, anxiety, and stress based on behavioral logs collected by pervasive computing devices such as smartphones, forecasting depressed moods is still an open question. This paper develops a recurrent neu- ral network algorithm that incorporates categorical embed- ding layers for forecasting depression. We collected large- scale records from 2,382 self-declared depressed people to conduct the experiment. Experimental results show that our method forecast the severely depressed mood of a user based on self-reported histories, with higher accuracy than SVM. The results also showed that the long-term historical information of a user improves the accuracy of forecasting depressed mood.},

We use a dataset of notifications received by 40 anonymous users in-the-wild, which consists of 1) qualitative user-labelled information about their preferences on notification's contents, 2) notification source, and 3) the context in which the notification was received. We assess the effectiveness of personalised prediction models generated using a combination of self-reported content importance and contextual information. We uncover four distinct user types, based on the number of daily notifications and interaction choices. We showcase how usage traits of these groups highlight the requirement for notification filtering approaches, e.g., when specific users habitually neglect to manually filter out unimportant notifications. Our machine learning-based predictor, based on both contextual sensing and notification contents can predict the user's preference for successfully acknowledging an incoming notification with 91.1\% mean accuracy, crucial for time-critical user engagement and interventions.},

Changes in the speech production process is one of many physiological changes that happen during stress. Microphones, embedded in mobile phones and carried ubiquitously by people, provide the opportunity to continuously and non-invasively monitor stress in real-life situations. We propose StressSense for unobtrusively recognizing stress from human voice using smartphones. We investigate methods for adapting a one-size-fitsall stress model to individual speakers and scenarios. We demonstrate that the StressSense classifier can robustly identify stress across multiple individuals in diverse acoustic environments: using model adaptation StressSense achieves 81\% and 76\% accuracy for indoor and outdoor environments, respectively. We show that StressSense can be implemented on commodity Android phones and run in real-time. To the best of our knowledge, StressSense represents the first system to consider voice based stress detection and model adaptation in diverse real-life conversational situations using smartphones.

	abstract = {An important question in behavioral epidemiology and public health is to understand how individual behavior is affected by illness and stress. Although changes in individual behavior are intertwined with contagion, epidemiologists today do not have sensing or modeling tools to quantitatively measure its effects in real-world conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel application of ubiquitous computing. We use mobile phone based co-location and communication sensing to measure characteristic behavior changes in symptomatic individuals, reflected in their total communication, interactions with respect to time of day (e.g., late night, early morning), diversity and entropy of face-to-face interactions and movement. Using these extracted mobile features, it is possible to predict the health status of an individual, without having actual health measurements from the subject. Finally, we estimate the temporal information flux and implied causality between physical symptoms, behavior and mental health. © 2010 ACM.},

	abstract = {Mobile sensing systems have made significant advances in tracking human behavior. However, the development of personalized mobile health feedback systems is still in its infancy. This paper introduces MyBehavior, a smartphone application that takes a novel approach to generate deeply personalized health feedback. It combines state-of-the-art behavior tracking with algorithms that are used in recommendation systems. MyBehavior automatically learns a user's physical activity and dietary behavior and strategically suggests changes to those behaviors for a healthier lifestyle. The system uses a sequential decision making algorithm, Multi-armed Bandit, to generate suggestions that maximize calorie loss and are easy for the user to adopt. In addition, the system takes into account user's preferences to encourage adoption using the pareto-frontier algorithm. In a 14-week study, results show statistically significant increases in physical activity and decreases in food calorie when using MyBehavior compared to a control condition.{\textbackslash}r{\textbackslash}n},

Although studies exist on the sharing of specific types of information (photos, posts, etc.), one area that has been less explored is how Facebook profiles can share personality information in a broad, machine-readable fashion. In this study, we apply data-mining and machine learning techniques to predict users' personality traits (specifically, the traits of the Big Five personality model) using only demographic and text-based attributes extracted from their profiles. We then use these predictions to rank individuals in terms of the five traits, predicting which users will appear in the top or bottom 5\% or 10\% of these traits. Our results show that when using certain models, we can find the top 10\% most Open individuals with nearly 75\% accuracy, and across all traits and directions, we can predict the top 10\% with at least 34.5\% accuracy (exceeding 21.8\%, which is the best accuracy when using just the best-performing profile attribute).

In this paper, we present initial results from an ongoing randomized control trial, where passive smartphone sensor data is collected from 21 outpatients with schizophrenia recently discharged from hospital over a period ranging from 2-8.5 months. Our results indicate that there are statistically significant associations between automatically tracked behavioral features related to sleep, mobility, conversations, smartphone usage and self-reported indicators of mental health in schizophrenia. Using these features we build inference models capable of accurately predicting aggregated scores of mental health indicators in schizophrenia with a mean error of 7.6\% of the score range. Finally, we discuss results on the level of personalization that is needed to account for the known variations within people. We show that by leveraging knowledge from a population with schizophrenia, it is possible to train accurate personalized models that require fewer individual-specific data to quickly adapt to new users.},

In this collaboration between engineers and psychologists, we present the first study to use smartphone sensors to examine socially anxious individuals’ fine-grained behaviors around periods in which they engage in some form of social interaction, and how these behaviors differ as a function of location (e.g., at home, at work, or at an unfamiliar location). In a two-week study of 52 college students, we show that there is a significant difference in behaviors for individuals based on social anxiety levels and locations, in that individuals higher (vs. lower) in social anxiety symptoms exhibit more movement (as tracked by the accelerometer) around the time of phone calls, especially in an unfamiliar location (i.e., not home or at work). Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings for developing better interventions for socially anxious individuals.},

	abstract = {Continuously monitoring schizophrenia patients' psychiatric symptoms is crucial for in-time intervention and treatment adjustment. The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) is a survey administered by clinicians to evaluate symptom severity in schizophrenia. The CrossCheck symptom prediction system is capable of tracking schizophrenia symptoms based on BPRS using passive sensing from mobile phones. We present results from an ongoing randomized control trial, where passive sensing data, self-reports, and clinician administered 7-item BPRS surveys are collected from 36 outpatients with schizophrenia recently discharged from hospital over a period ranging from 2-12 months. We show that our system can predict a symptom scale score based on a 7-item BPRS within ±1.45 error on average using automatically tracked behavioral features from phones (e.g., mobility, conversation, activity, smartphone usage, the ambient acoustic environment) and user supplied self-reports. Importantly, we show our system is also capable of predicting an individual BPRS score within ±1.59 error purely based on passive sensing from phones without any self-reported information from outpatients. Finally, we discuss how well our predictive system reflects symptoms experienced by patients by reviewing a number of case studies.},

	abstract = {Background: Existing research postulates a variety of components that show an impact on utilization of technology-mediated mental health information systems (MHIS) and treatment outcome. Although researchers assessed the effect of isolated design elements on the results of Web-based interventions and the associations between symptom reduction and use of components across computer and mobile phone platforms, there remains uncertainty with regard to which components of technology-mediated interventions for mental health exert the greatest therapeutic gain. Until now, no studies have presented results on the therapeutic benefit associated with specific service components of technology-mediated MHIS for depression. Objective: This systematic review aims at identifying components of technology-mediated MHIS for patients with depression. Consequently, all randomized controlled trials comparing technology-mediated treatments for depression to either waiting-list control, treatment as usual, or any other form of treatment for depression were reviewed. Updating prior reviews, this study aims to (1) assess the effectiveness of technology-supported interventions for the treatment of depression and (2) add to the debate on what components in technology-mediated MHIS for the treatment of depression should be standard of care. Methods: Systematic searches in MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library were conducted. Effect sizes for each comparison between a technology-enabled intervention and a control condition were computed using the standard mean difference (SMD). Chi-square tests were used to test for heterogeneity. Using subgroup analysis, potential sources of heterogeneity were analyzed. Publication bias was examined using visual inspection of funnel plots and Begg’s test. Qualitative data analysis was also used. In an explorative approach, a list of relevant components was extracted from the body of literature by consensus between two researchers. Results: Of 6387 studies initially identified, 45 met all inclusion criteria. Programs analyzed showed a significant trend toward reduced depressive symptoms (SMD –0.58, 95\% CI –0.71 to –0.45, P{\textless}.001). Heterogeneity was large (I2≥76). A total of 15 components were identified. Conclusions: Technology-mediated MHIS for the treatment of depression has a consistent positive overall effect compared to controls. A total of 15 components have been identified. Further studies are needed to quantify the impact of individual components on treatment effects and to identify further components that are relevant for the design of future technology-mediated interventions for the treatment of depression and other mental disorders.

	doi = {10.2196/jmir.6820},
	abstract = {Background: Research in psychology demonstrates a strong link between state affect (moment-to-moment experiences of positive or negative emotionality) and trait affect (eg, relatively enduring depression and social anxiety symptoms), and a tendency to withdraw (eg, spending time at home). However, existing work is based almost exclusively on static, self-reported descriptions of emotions and behavior that limit generalizability. Despite adoption of increasingly sophisticated research designs and technology (eg, mobile sensing using a global positioning system [GPS]), little research has integrated these seemingly disparate forms of data to improve understanding of how emotional experiences in everyday life are associated with time spent at home, and whether this is influenced by depression or social anxiety symptoms. Objective: We hypothesized that more time spent at home would be associated with more negative and less positive affect. Methods: We recruited 72 undergraduate participants from a southeast university in the United States. We assessed depression and social anxiety symptoms using self-report instruments at baseline. An app (Sensus) installed on participants' personal mobile phones repeatedly collected in situ self-reported state affect and GPS location data for up to 2 weeks. Time spent at home was a proxy for social isolation. Results: We tested separate models examining the relations between state affect and time spent at home, with levels of depression and social anxiety as moderators. Models differed only in the temporal links examined. One model focused on associations between changes in affect and time spent at home within short, 4-hour time windows. The other 3 models focused on associations between mean-level affect within a day and time spent at home (1) the same day, (2) the following day, and (3) the previous day. Overall, we obtained many of the expected main effects (although there were some null effects), in which higher social anxiety was associated with more time or greater likelihood of spending time at home, and more negative or less positive affect was linked to longer homestay. Interactions indicated that, among individuals higher in social anxiety, higher negative affect and lower positive affect within a day was associated with greater likelihood of spending time at home the following day. Conclusions: Results demonstrate the feasibility and utility of modeling the relationship between affect and homestay using fine-grained GPS data. Although these findings must be replicated in a larger study and with clinical samples, they suggest that integrating repeated state affect assessments in situ with continuous GPS data can increase understanding of how actual homestay is related to affect in everyday life and to symptoms of anxiety and depression.},

	volume = {2},
	abstract = {Although social anxiety and depression are common, they are often underdiagnosed and undertreated, in part due to difficulties identifying and accessing individuals in need of services. Current assessments rely on client self-report and clinician judgment, which are vulnerable to social desirability and other subjective biases. Identifying objective, nonburdensome markers of these mental health problems, such as features of speech, could help advance assessment, prevention, and treatment approaches. Prior research examining speech detection methods has focused on fully supervised learning approaches employing strongly labeled data. However, strong labeling of individuals high in symptoms or state affect in speech audio data is impractical, in part because it is not possible to identify with high confidence which regions of a long speech indicate the person's symptoms or affective state. We propose a weakly supervised learning framework for detecting social anxiety and depression from long audio clips. Specifically, we present a novel feature modeling technique named NN2Vec that identifies and exploits the inherent relationship between speakers' vocal states and symptoms/affective states. Detecting speakers high in social anxiety or depression symptoms using NN2Vec features achieves F-1 scores 17\% and 13\% higher than those of the best available baselines. In addition, we present a new multiple instance learning adaptation of a BLSTM classifier, named BLSTM-MIL. Our novel framework of using NN2Vec features with the BLSTM-MIL classifier achieves F-1 scores of 90.1\% and 85.44\% in detecting speakers high in social anxiety and depression symptoms.},

	abstract = {Background: Feelings of loneliness are associated with poor physical and mental health. Detection of loneliness through passive sensing on personal devices can lead to the development of interventions aimed at decreasing rates of loneliness. Objective: The aim of this study was to explore the potential of using passive sensing to infer levels of loneliness and to identify the corresponding behavioral patterns. Methods: Data were collected from smartphones and Fitbits (Flex 2) of 160 college students over a semester. The participants completed the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) loneliness questionnaire at the beginning and end of the semester. For a classification purpose, the scores were categorized into high (questionnaire score{\textgreater}40) and low (≤40) levels of loneliness. Daily features were extracted from both devices to capture activity and mobility, communication and phone usage, and sleep behaviors. The features were then averaged to generate semester-level features. We used 3 analytic methods: (1) statistical analysis to provide an overview of loneliness in college students, (2) data mining using the Apriori algorithm to extract behavior patterns associated with loneliness, and (3) machine learning classification to infer the level of loneliness and the change in levels of loneliness using an ensemble of gradient boosting and logistic regression algorithms with feature selection in a leave-one-student-out cross-validation manner. Results: The average loneliness score from the presurveys and postsurveys was above 43 (presurvey SD 9.4 and postsurvey SD 10.4), and the majority of participants fell into the high loneliness category (scores above 40) with 63.8\% (102/160) in the presurvey and 58.8\% (94/160) in the postsurvey. Scores greater than 1 standard deviation above the mean were observed in 12.5\% (20/160) of the participants in both pre- and postsurvey scores. The majority of scores, however, fell between 1 standard deviation below and above the mean (pre=66.9\% [107/160] and post=73.1\% [117/160]). Our machine learning pipeline achieved an accuracy of 80.2\% in detecting the binary level of loneliness and an 88.4\% accuracy in detecting change in the loneliness level. The mining of associations between classifier-selected behavioral features and loneliness indicated that compared with students with low loneliness, students with high levels of loneliness were spending less time outside of campus during evening hours on weekends and spending less time in places for social events in the evening on weekdays (support=17\% and confidence=92\%). The analysis also indicated that more activity and less sedentary behavior, especially in the evening, was associated with a decrease in levels of loneliness from the beginning of the semester to the end of it (support=31\% and confidence=92\%). Conclusions: Passive sensing has the potential for detecting loneliness in college students and identifying the associated behavioral patterns. These findings highlight intervention opportunities through mobile technology to reduce the impact of loneliness on individuals’ health and well-being.},

Subjects downloaded and used the Mindful Moods app on their personal smartphone to complete up to three survey sessions per day, during which a randomized subset of PHQ-9 symptoms of major depressive disorder were assessed on a Likert scale. The study lasted 29 or 30 days without additional follow-up. Outcome measures included adherence, measured by the percentage of completed survey sessions, and estimates of daily PHQ-9 scores collected from the smartphone app, as well as from the traditionally administered PHQ-9.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: Overall adherence was 77.78\% (903/1161) and varied with time of day. PHQ-9 estimates collected from the app strongly correlated (r=.84) with traditionally administered PHQ-9 scores, but app-collected scores were 3.02 (SD 2.25) points higher on average. More subjects reported suicidal ideation using the app than they did on the traditionally administered PHQ-9.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: Patients with major depressive disorder are able to utilize an app on their personal smartphones to self-assess their symptoms of major depressive disorder with high levels of adherence. These app-collected results correlate with the traditionally administered PHQ-9. Scores recorded from the app may potentially be more sensitive and better able to capture suicidality than the traditional PHQ-9.},

Recent Findings: To date, most studies consist of pilot evaluations demonstrating feasibility and acceptability of monitoring sleep using smartphones and wearable devices among individuals with psychiatric disorders. Promising findings show early associations between behaviors and sleep parameters and agreement between clinic-based assessments, active smartphone data capture, and passively collected data. Few studies report improvement in sleep or mental health outcomes. Summary: Success of smartphone-based sleep assessments and interventions requires emphasis on promoting long-term adherence, exploring possibilities of adaptive and personalized systems to predict risk/relapse, and determining impact of sleep monitoring on improving patients’ quality of life and clinically meaningful outcomes.},

Although the potential healthcare applications are far-reaching, passive data raises numerous ethical challenges. Materials and Methods: We performed a systematic review to identify all ethical concerns, normative standpoints, and underlying arguments related to the use of passive data in healthcare. Results: Among the various challenges discussed in the ethical literature, informational privacy, informed consent, and data security were the primary focus of the current debate. Other topics of discussion were the evaluation and regulation of products, equity in access, vulnerable patient groups, ownership, and secondary use. Conclusion: No clear ethical framework has been established that stimulates passive data-driven innovation while protecting patient integrity. The consensus in the ethical literature, as well as the parallels with similar concerns and solutions in other fields, can lay a foundation for the construction of an ethical framework. The future debate should focus on conflicts between two or more ethical, technical, or clinical values to ensure a safe and effective implementation of passive data in healthcare.},

	doi = {10.1145/988672.988750},
	abstract = {The ability to determine what day-to-day activity (such as cooking pasta, taking a pill, or watching a video) a person is performing is of interest in many application domains. A system that can do this requires models of the activities of interest, but model construction does not scale well: humans must specify low-level details, such as segmentation and feature selection of sensor data, and high-level structure, such as spatio-temporal relations between states of the model, for each and every activity. As a result, previous practical activity recognition systems have been content to model a tiny fraction of the thousands of human activities that are potentially useful to detect. In this paper, we present an approach to sensing and modeling activities that scales to a much larger class of activities than before. We show how a new class of sensors, based on Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags, can directly yield semantic terms that describe the state of the physical world. These sensors allow us to formulate activity models by translating labeled activities, such as "cooking pasta", into probabilistic collections of object terms, such as "pot". Given this view of activity models as text translations, we show how to mine definitions of activities in an unsupervised manner from the web. We have used our technique to mine definitions for over 20,000 activities. We experimentally validate our approach using data gathered from actual human activity as well as simulated data.},

	volume = {18},

	doi = {10.2196/jmir.6759},
	abstract = {Background: Physical activity helps people maintain a healthy weight and reduces the risk for several chronic diseases. Although this knowledge is widely recognized, adults and children in many countries around the world do not get recommended amounts of physical activity. Although many interventions are found to be ineffective at increasing physical activity or reaching inactive populations, there have been anecdotal reports of increased physical activity due to novel mobile games that embed game play in the physical world. The most recent and salient example of such a game is Pokémon Go, which has reportedly reached tens of millions of users in the United States and worldwide. Objective: The objective of this study was to quantify the impact of Pokémon Go on physical activity. Methods: We study the effect of Pokémon Go on physical activity through a combination of signals from large-scale corpora of wearable sensor data and search engine logs for 32,000 Microsoft Band users over a period of 3 months. Pokémon Go players are identified through search engine queries and physical activity is measured through accelerometers. Results: We find that Pokémon Go leads to significant increases in physical activity over a period of 30 days, with particularly engaged users (ie, those making multiple search queries for details about game usage) increasing their activity by 1473 steps a day on average, a more than 25\% increase compared with their prior activity level (P{\textless}.001). In the short time span of the study, we estimate that Pokémon Go has added a total of 144 billion steps to US physical activity. Furthermore, Pokémon Go has been able to increase physical activity across men and women of all ages, weight status, and prior activity levels showing this form of game leads to increases in physical activity with significant implications for public health. In particular, we find that Pokémon Go is able to reach low activity populations, whereas all 4 leading mobile health apps studied in this work largely draw from an already very active population. Conclusions: Mobile apps combining game play with physical activity lead to substantial short-term activity increases and, in contrast to many existing interventions and mobile health apps, have the potential to reach activity-poor populations. Future studies are needed to investigate potential long-term effects of these applications.},

Given emerging sensor technology, however, it is possible to view activity data as a stream of natural language terms. Activity models are then mappings from such terms to activity names, and may be extracted from text corpora such as the web. We show that models so extracted are sufficient to automatically produce labeled segmentations of activity data with an accuracy of 42\% over 26 activities, well above the 3.8\% baseline. The segmentation so obtained is sufficient to bootstrap learning, with accuracy of learned models increasing to 52\%. To our knowledge, this is the first human activity inferencing system shown to learn from sensed activity data with no human intervention per activity learned, even for labeling.

We present the design, implementation and evaluation of the Jigsaw continuous sensing engine, which balances the performance needs of the application and the resource demands of continuous sensing on the phone. Jigsaw comprises a set of sensing pipelines for the accelerometer, microphone and GPS sensors, which are built in a plug and play manner to support: i) resilient accelerometer data processing, which allows inferences to be robust to different phone hardware, orientation and body positions; ii) smart admission control and on-demand processing for the microphone and accelerometer data, which adaptively throttles the depth and sophistication of sensing pipelines when the input data is low quality or uninformative; and iii) adaptive pipeline processing, which judiciously triggers power hungry pipeline stages (e.g., sampling the GPS) taking into account the mobility and behavioral patterns of the user to drive down energy costs. We implement and evaluate Jigsaw on the Nokia N95 and the Apple iPhone, two popular smartphone platforms, to demonstrate its capability to recognize user activities and perform long term GPS tracking in an energy-efficientmanner.

The model uses multiple levels of abstraction in order to bridge the gap between raw GPS sensor measurements and high level information such as a user's destination and mode of transportation. To achieve efficient inference, we apply Rao-Blackwellized particle filters at multiple levels of the model hierarchy. Locations such as bus stops and parking lots, where the user frequently changes mode of transportation, are learned from GPS data logs without manual labeling of training data. We experimentally demonstrate how to accurately detect novel behavior or user errors (e.g. taking a wrong bus) by explicitly modeling activities in the context of the user's historical data. Finally, we discuss an application called "Opportunity Knocks" that employs our techniques to help cognitively-impaired people use public transportation safely. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Low-level primitives are areas of coherent motion found by EM clustering, mid-level categories are simple movements represented by dynamical systems, and high-level complex gestures are represented by Hidden Markov Models as successive phases of simple movements.

In our experimental results with real crime data from London we obtain an accuracy of almost 70\% when predicting whether a specific area in the city will be a crime hotspot or not.

HMMs are perhaps the most successful framework in perceptual computing for modeling and classifying dynamic behaviors, popular because they offer dynamic time warping, a training algorithm, and a clear Bayesian semantics. However, the Markovian framework makes strong restrictive assumptions about the system generating the signal - that it is a single process having a small number of states and an extremely limited state memory. The single-process model is often inappropriate for vision (and speech) applications, resulting in low ceilings on model performance. Coupled HMMs provide an efficient way to resolve many of these problems, and offer superior training speeds, model likelihoods, and robustness to initial conditions.},

A number of studies have investigated driving style, but they often rely on the use of self-reports or simulators, which are not suitable for the real-time, continuous, automated assessment and feedback on the road. In order to understand and model aggressive driving style, we construct an invehicle sensing platform that uses a smartphone instead of using heavyweight, expensive systems. Utilizing additional cheap sensors, our sensing platform can collect useful information about vehicle movement, maneuvering and steering wheel movement. We use this data and apply machine learning to build a driver model that evaluates drivers' driving styles based on a number of driving-related features. From a naturalistic data collection from 22 drivers for 3 weeks, we analyzed the characteristics of drivers who have an aggressive driving style. Our model classified those drivers with an accuracy of 90.5\% (violation-class) and 81\% (questionnaire-class). We describe how, in future work, our model can be used to provide real-time feedback to drivers using only their current smartphone. Copyright © ACM.},

To identify how a simple routine learner can demonstrate this in support of family coordination, we conducted six months of nightly interviews with six families, focusing on how they make and execute plans. Our data reveals that only about 40\% of events unfold in a routine manner. When deviations do occur, family members often need but do not have access to accurate information about their routines. With about 90\% of their content concerning deviations, not routines, families do not rely on calendars to support them during these moments. We discuss how coordination tools, like calendars and reminder systems, would improve coordination and reduce stress when augmented with routine information, and how commercial mobile phones can support the automatic creation of routine models. © 2010 ACM.},

We then describe the concept of an Activity Recognition Chain (ARC) as a general-purpose framework for designing and evaluating activity recognition systems. We detail each component of the framework, provide references to related research, and introduce the best practice methods developed by the activity recognition research community.

Driving behaviors include types of destinations, driving efficiency, and trip times. Beyond considering previously visited destinations, Predestination leverages an open-world modeling methodology that considers the likelihood of users visiting previously unobserved locations based on trends in the data and on the background properties of locations. This allows our algorithm to smoothly transition between “out of the box” with no training data to more fully trained with increasing numbers of observations. Multiple components of the analysis are fused via Bayesian inference to produce a probabilistic map of destinations. Our algorithm was trained and tested on hold-out data drawn from a database of GPS driving data gathered from 169 different subjects who drove 7,335 different trips.},

This adds value to UbiComp and personal informatics in terms of user context and new performance data to collect and visualize, and it benefits healthcare as sleep is correlated with many health issues. To assess this opportunity, we collected one month of phone sensor and sleep diary entries from 27 people who have a variety of sleep contexts. We used this data to construct models that detect sleep and wake states, daily sleep quality, and global sleep quality. Our system classifies sleep state with 93.06\% accuracy, daily sleep quality with 83.97\% accuracy, and overall sleep quality with 81.48\% accuracy. Individual models performed better than generally trained models, where the individual models require 3 days of ground truth data and 3 weeks of ground truth data to perform well on detecting sleep and sleep quality, respectively. Finally, the features of noise and movement were useful to infer sleep quality.},

	abstract = {Background: Real-time detection of drinking could improve timely delivery of interventions aimed at reducing alcohol consumption and alcohol-related injury, but existing detection methods are burdensome or impractical. Objective: To evaluate whether phone sensor data and machine learning models are useful to detect alcohol use events, and to discuss implications of these results for just-in-time mobile interventions. Methods: 38 non-treatment seeking young adult heavy drinkers downloaded AWARE app (which continuously collected mobile phone sensor data), and reported alcohol consumption (number of drinks, start/end time of prior day's drinking) for 28 days. We tested various machine learning models using the 20 most informative sensor features to classify time periods as non-drinking, low-risk (1 to 3/4 drinks per occasion for women/men), and high-risk drinking ({\textgreater} 4/5 drinks per occasion for women/men). Results: Among 30 participants in the analyses, 207 non-drinking, 41 low-risk, and 45 high-risk drinking episodes were reported. A Random Forest model using 30-min windows with 1 day of historical data performed best for detecting high-risk drinking, correctly classifying high-risk drinking windows 90.9\% of the time. The most informative sensor features were related to time (i.e., day of week, time of day), movement (e.g., change in activities), device usage (e.g., screen duration), and communication (e.g., call duration, typing speed). Conclusions: Preliminary evidence suggests that sensor data captured from mobile phones of young adults is useful in building accurate models to detect periods of high-risk drinking. Interventions using mobile phone sensor features could trigger delivery of a range of interventions to potentially improve effectiveness.},

	abstract = {Sleep is an important part of our daily routine-we spend about one-third of our time doing it. By tracking sleep-related events and activities, sleep monitoring provides decision support to help us understand sleep quality and causes of poor sleep. Wearable devices provide a new way for sleep monitoring, allowing us to monitor sleep from the comfort of our own home. However, existing solutions do not take full advantage of the rich sensor data provided by these devices. In this paper, we present the design and development of SleepGuard, a novel approach to track a wide range of sleep-related events using smartwatches. We show that using merely a single smartwatch, it is possible to capture a rich amount of information about sleep events and sleeping context, including body posture and movements, acoustic events, and illumination conditions. We demonstrate that through these events it is possible to estimate sleep quality and identify factors affecting it most. We evaluate our approach by conducting extensive experiments involved fifteen users across a 2-week period. Our experimental results show that our approach can track a richer set of sleep events, provide better decision support for evaluating sleep quality, and help to identify causes for sleep problems compared to prior work.},

	abstract = {Automatic recognition of behavioral context (location, activities, body-posture etc.) can serve health monitoring, aging care, and many other domains. Recognizing context in-the-wild is challenging because of great variability in behavioral patterns, and it requires a complex mapping from sensor features to predicted labels. Data collected in-the-wild may be unbalanced and incomplete, with cases of missing labels or missing sensors. We propose using the multiple layer perceptron (MLP) as a multi-task model for context recognition. Based on features from multi-modal sensors, the model simultaneously predicts many diverse context labels. We analyze the advantages of the model's hidden layers, which are shared among all sensors and all labels, and provide insight to the behavioral patterns that these hidden layers may capture. We demonstrate how recognition of new labels can be improved when utilizing a model that was trained for an initial set of labels, and show how to train the model to withstand missing sensors. We evaluate context recognition on the previously published ExtraSensory Dataset, which was collected in-the-wild. Compared to previously suggested models, the MLP improves recognition, even with fewer parameters than a linear model. The ability to train a good model using data that has incomplete, unbalanced labeling and missing sensors encourages further research with uncontrolled, in-the-wild behavior.},

After a careful review of existing mobile data literature, we found that there have been no large-scale studies to understand smartphone usage behavior in India -- the second-largest and fastest growing smartphone market in the world. With the goal of understanding various facets of smartphone usage in India, we conducted a mixed-method longitudinal data collection study through an Android app released on Google Play. Our app was installed by 215 users, and logged 11.9 million data points from them over a period of 8 months. We analyzed this rich dataset along the lines of four broad facets of smartphone behavior -- how users use different apps, interact with notihcations, react to different contexts, and charge their smartphones -- to paint a holistic picture of smartphone usage behavior of Indian users. This quantitative analysis was complemented by a survey with 55 users and semi-structured interviews with 26 users to deeply understand their smartphone usage behavior. While our first-of-its-kind study uncovered many interesting facts about Indian smartphone users, we also found striking differences in usage behavior compared to past studies in other geographical contexts. We observed that Indian users spend significant time with their smartphones after midnight, continuously check notifications without attending to them and are extremely conscious about their smartphones’ battery. Perhaps the most dramatic finding is the nature of mobile consumerism of Indian users as shown by our results. Taken together, these and the rest of our findings demonstrate the unique characteristics that are shaping the smartphone usage behavior of Indian users.},

	abstract = {Alcohol use in young adults is common, with high rates of morbidity and mortality largely due to periodic, heavy drinking episodes (HDEs). Behavioral interventions delivered through electronic communication modalities (e.g., text messaging) can reduce the frequency of HDEs in young adults, but effects are small. One way to amplify these effects is to deliver support materials proximal to drinking occasions, but this requires knowledge of when they will occur. Mobile phones have built-in sensors that can potentially be useful in monitoring behavioral patterns associated with the initiation of drinking occasions. The objective of our work is to explore the detection of daily-life behavioral markers using mobile phone sensors and their utility in identifying drinking occasions. We utilized data from 30 young adults aged 21-28 with past hazardous drinking and collected mobile phone sensor data and daily Experience Sampling Method (ESM) of drinking for 28 consecutive days. We built a machine learning-based model that is 96.6\% accurate at identifying non-drinking, drinking and heavy drinking episodes. We highlight the most important features for detecting drinking episodes and identify the amount of historical data needed for accurate detection. Our results suggest that mobile phone sensors can be used for automated, continuous monitoring of at-risk populations to detect drinking episodes and support the delivery of timely interventions.},

	abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma are the most common respiratory diseases that impact millions of people worldwide annually. With advances in mobile computing and machine learning techniques, there has been increased interest in using mobile devices to monitor pulmonary diseases. Nevertheless, the current state-of-the-art technology requires active involvement and high-effort input from the users, impeding continuous monitoring of pulmonary conditions. In this work, two algorithms are proposed for passive assessment of pulmonary condition: one for detection of obstructive pulmonary disease and the other for estimation of the pulmonary function in terms of F EV1/F V C ratio, which is an established clinical metric. The algorithms were developed and validated using the data sets from two studies: research study (healthy=40, patholog-ical=91) and in-clinic study (healthy=10, pathological=60). From the cross-study validation where a classifier was trained on the research data set and tested on the in-clinic data set, the detection accuracy of the pathological class was obtained as 73.7\% and the F1 score was 84.5\% (87.2\% precision and 82.0\% recall). In our regression analysis, the F EV1/F V C ratio was predicted with a mean absolute error of 8.6\%. Our analysis shows promising results and this work presents a meaningful milestone towards the passive assessment of pulmonary functions from spontaneous speech collected from a mobile phone.},

	abstract = {Everyday wearables with enhanced computational capacity, good quality sensors, and machine learning/artificial intelligence enabled algorithms have the potential to play a key role not only in the fitness and wellness sector but also in the field of disease diagnostics and monitoring. The major challenges are a limited number of sensors, reliable data collection and processing, and deployment of computationally efficient algorithms. In this multi-cohort study, we have used everyday wearables such as chest band and smartwatch to investigate the heart rate variability (HRV) of 131 subjects which include 40 healthy controls, 69 asthma patients, 9 COPD patients and 13 patients with a co-morbidity of asthma and COPD. We aimed at a comprehensive investigation by exploring a total of 58 features including time domain, frequency domain, non-linear and entropy measures of HRV to identify the HRV indices that provide significant discriminatory information for classification between healthy and pulmonary patients. Feature ranking has been done by the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve. Classification of patients with the 15 top ranked features using data from the chest band heart rate sensor as well as estimated HRV parameters from smartwatch PPG signal have been investigated separately. Using the chest band data, a classification accuracy of 82.07\%, precision of 83.13\%, recall of 81.53\% and F-1 score of 81.7\% have been achieved; whereas using the smartwatch data, a classification accuracy of 80\%, precision of 79.9\%, recall of 80\% and F-1 score of 79.94\% have been achieved for the test set with an AdaBoost classifier. Heart rate variability metrics also showed significant correlation with disease severity and impact on health-related quality of life as measured by pulmonary function test, Asthma Symptoms Utility Index and COPD assessment test score respectively. The results indicate that HRV analysis using everyday wearables may be helpful in the assessment and management of asthma and COPD.},

	abstract = {Human activities are inherently translation invariant and hierarchical. Human activity recognition (HAR), a field that has garnered a lot of attention in recent years due to its high demand in various application domains, makes use of time-series sensor data to infer activities. In this paper, a deep convolutional neural network (convnet) is proposed to perform efficient and effective HAR using smartphone sensors by exploiting the inherent characteristics of activities and 1D time-series signals, at the same time providing a way to automatically and data-adaptively extract robust features from raw data. Experiments show that convnets indeed derive relevant and more complex features with every additional layer, although difference of feature complexity level decreases with every additional layer. A wider time span of temporal local correlation can be exploited (1 × 9-1 × 14) and a low pooling size (1 × 2-1 × 3) is shown to be beneficial. Convnets also achieved an almost perfect classification on moving activities, especially very similar ones which were previously perceived to be very difficult to classify. Lastly, convnets outperform other state-of-the-art data mining techniques in HAR for the benchmark dataset collected from 30 volunteer subjects, achieving an overall performance of 94.79\% on the test set with raw sensor data, and 95.75\% with additional information of temporal fast Fourier transform of the HAR data set.},

Conventional pattern recognition approaches have made tremendous progress in the past years. However, those methods often heavily rely on heuristic hand-crafted feature extraction, which could hinder their generalization performance. Additionally, existing methods are undermined for unsupervised and incremental learning tasks. Recently, the recent advancement of deep learning makes it possible to perform automatic high-level feature extraction thus achieves promising performance in many areas. Since then, deep learning based methods have been widely adopted for the sensor-based activity recognition tasks. This paper surveys the recent advance of deep learning based sensor-based activity recognition. We summarize existing literature from three aspects: sensor modality, deep model, and application. We also present detailed insights on existing work and propose grand challenges for future research.},

	abstract = {Sensor-enabled smartphones are opening a new frontier in the development of mobile sensing applications. The recognition of human activities and context from sensor-data using classification models underpins these emerging applications. However, conventional approaches to training classifiers struggle to cope with the diverse user populations routinely found in large-scale popular mobile applications. Differences between users (e.g., age, sex, behavioral patterns, lifestyle) confuse classifiers, which assume everyone is the same. To address this, we propose Community Similarity Networks (CSN), which incorporates inter-person similarity measurements into the classifier training process. Under CSN every user has a unique classifier that is tuned to their own characteristics. CSN exploits crowd-sourced sensor-data to personalize classifiers with data contributed from other similar users. This process is guided by similarity networks that measure different dimensions of inter-person similarity. Our experiments show CSN outperforms existing approaches to classifier training under the presence of population diversity. © 2011 ACM.},

The methodology offers designers a set of principles, perspectives, methods, and tools for exploring and testing movement-related design concepts. It is innovative for the inclusion of the perspective of the mover, together with the traditional perspectives of the observer and the machine.

This paper presents Kinesthetic Interaction as a unifying concept for describing the body in motion as a foundation for designing interactive systems. Based on the theoretical foundation for Kinesthetic Interaction, a conceptual framework is introduced to reveal bodily potential in relation to three design themes - kinesthetic development, kinesthetic means and kinesthetic disorder; and seven design parameters - engagement, sociality, movability, explicit motivation, implicit motivation, expressive meaning and kinesthetic empathy. The framework is a tool to be utilized when analyzing existing designs, as well as developing designs exploring new ways of designing kinesthetic interactions.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an ongoing doctoral project that concerns design and development of computer interfaces supporting full body movement interaction. It combines theories and experiences from dance education and HCI. The main aim is to try out a new approach to develop concepts of movement-based interaction. The work consists of an explorative case study aiming at describing the learning process that HCI students and professionals experience when attending a course in Physical Expression, based on modern dance and improvisation. A second aim is to describe the possible reflection of this experience in the design outcome. The third aim is to develop an example of a full body movement-based environment. The study is using a qualitative approach and makes use of data as interviews, video, texts and design mock-ups. Preliminary results show that the course provides new perspectives on bodily communication and may function as a "mind opener".},

We are interested in understanding how non-expert users interact with such multi-touch surfaces. We provide a categorization and a framework of multi-touch hand gestures for interacting with a GIS. This framework is based on an initial evaluation. We present results of a more detailed in situ-study mainly focusing on multi-user multi-touch interaction with geospatial data. Furthermore we extend our framework using a combination of multi-touch gestures with a small set of foot gestures to solve geospatial tasks. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

Full-body motion-control games provide an opportunity for these adults to remain active and engaged; these games are not designed with age-related impairments in mind, which prevents the games from being leveraged to increase the activity levels of older adults. In this paper, we present two studies aimed at developing game design guidelines for full-body motion controls for older adults experiencing age-related changes and impairments. Our studies also demonstrate how full-body motion-control games can accommodate a variety of user abilities, have a positive effect on mood and, by extension, the emotional well-being of older adults. Based on our studies, we present seven guidelines for the design of full-body interaction in games. The guidelines are designed to foster safe physical activity among older adults, thereby increasing their quality of life. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

Satyr play was a highly self-conscious genre enagaging not only with the same sorts of myths as tragedy, but also with specific literary forms including epic and tragic poetry. Euripides' Cyclops embodies many of the tropes of satyric drama generally, many of which have been identified as folktale motifs. Euripides' Cyclops depicts a potentially more serious side to these paradoxical creatures, whose ambivalence is evident elsewhere in Greek literature and thought.},

Our qualitative study using an on-body projection system in a public exhibition investigates this concept with regards to body characteristics, types of body input, interactions between multiple bodies, and comparison to other display technologies. Our findings show that body as a canvas create connectedness between the body and information.

The BodyBeat mobile sensing system consists of a custom-built piezoelectric microphone and a distributed computational framework that utilizes an ARM microcontroller and an Android smartphone. The custom-built microphone is designed to capture subtle body vibrations directly from the body surface without being perturbed by external sounds. The microphone is attached to a 3D printed neckpiece with a suspension mechanism. The ARM embedded system and the Android smartphone process the acoustic signal from the microphone and identify non-speech body sounds. We have extensively evaluated the BodyBeat mobile sensing system.

Classifiers are developed considering 2 different system architectures: i) mobile-cloud hybrid architecture, and ii) mobile in-situ architecture. Patient privacy is preserved in the phone by filtering speech with a shallow classifier. To evaluate DeepLung, a novel and rigorous lung activity dataset is made by collecting audio and inertial sensor data from more than 131 real pulmonary patients and healthy subjects and annotated accurately by professional crowdsourcing.

The model is fully probabilistic and autoregressive, with the predictive distribution for each audio sample conditioned on all previous ones; nonetheless we show that it can be efficiently trained on data with tens of thousands of samples per second of audio. When applied to text-to-speech, it yields state-of-the-art performance, with human listeners rating it as significantly more natural sounding than the best parametric and concatenative systems for both English and Mandarin. A single WaveNet can capture the characteristics of many different speakers with equal fidelity, and can switch between them by conditioning on the speaker identity. When trained to model music, we find that it generates novel and often highly realistic musical fragments. We also show that it can be employed as a discriminative model, returning promising results for phoneme recognition.},

FluSense uses a microphone array and a thermal camera along with a neural computing engine to passively and continuously characterize speech and cough sounds along with changes in crowd density on the edge in a real-time manner. We conducted an IRB-approved 7 month-long study from December 10, 2018 to July 12, 2019 where we deployed FluSense in four public waiting areas within the hospital of a large university. During this period, the FluSense platform collected and analyzed more than 350,000 waiting room thermal images and 21 million non-speech audio samples from the hospital waiting areas. FluSense can accurately predict daily patient counts with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.95. We also compared signals from FluSense with the gold standard laboratory-confirmed influenza case data obtained in the same facility and found that our sensor-based features are strongly correlated with laboratory-confirmed influenza trends.},

In this paper, we present DeepEar - the first mobile audio sensing framework built from coupled Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) that simultaneously perform common audio sensing tasks. We train DeepEar with a large-scale dataset including unlabeled data from 168 place visits. The resulting learned model, involving 2.3M parameters, enables DeepEar to significantly increase inference robustness to background noise beyond conventional approaches present in mobile devices. Finally, we show DeepEar is feasible for smartphones by building a cloud-free DSP-based prototype that runs continuously, using only 6\% of the smartphone's battery daily.},

	abstract = {The problem of attending to the health of the aged who live alone has became an important issue in developed countries. One way of solving the problem is to check their health condition by a remote-monitoring technique and support them with well-timed treatment. The purpose of this study is to develop an automatic system that can monitor a health condition in real time using acoustical information and detect an abnormal symptom. In this study, cough sound was chosen as a representative acoustical symptom of abnormal health conditions. For the development of the system distinguishing a cough sound from other environmental sounds, a hybrid model was proposed that consists of an artificial neural network (ANN) model and a hidden Markov model (HMM). The ANN model used energy cepstral coefficients obtained by filter banks based on human auditory characteristics as input parameters representing a spectral feature of a sound signal. Subsequently, an output of this ANN model and a filtered envelope of the signal were used for making an input sequence for the HMM that deals with the temporal variation of the sound signal. Compared with the conventional HMM using Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, the proposed hybrid model improved recognition rates on low SNR from 5 dB down to -10 dB. Finally, a preliminary prototype of the automatic detection system was simply illustrated. © 2009 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes SymDetector, a smartphone based application to unobtrusively detect the sound-related respiratory symptoms occurred in a user's daily life, including sneeze, cough, sniffle and throat clearing. SymDetector uses the builtin microphone on the smartphone to continuously monitor a user's acoustic data and uses multi-level processes to detect and classify the respiratory symptoms. Several practical issues are considered in developing SymDetector, such as users' privacy concerns about their acoustic data, resource constraints of the smartphone and different contexts of the smartphone. We have implemented SymDetector on Galaxy S3 and evaluated its performance in real experiments involving 16 users and 204 days. The experimental results show that SymDetector can detect these four types of respiratory symptoms with high accuracy under various conditions.},

	abstract = {Inability to test at scale has become Achille's heel in humanity's ongoing war against COVID-19 pandemic. An agile, scalable and cost-effective testing, deployable at a global scale, can act as a game changer in this war. To address this challenge, building on the promising results of our prior work on cough-based diagnosis of a motley of respiratory diseases, we develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based test for COVID-19 preliminary diagnosis. The test is deployable at scale through a mobile app named AI4COVID-19. The AI4COVID-19 app requires 2-second cough recordings of the subject. By analyzing the cough samples through an AI engine running in the cloud, the app returns a preliminary diagnosis within a minute. Unfortunately, cough is common symptom of over two dozen non-COVID-19 related medical conditions. This makes the COVID-19 diagnosis from cough alone an extremely challenging problem. We solve this problem by developing a novel multi-pronged mediator centered risk-averse AI architecture that minimizes misdiagnosis. At the time of writing, our AI engine can distinguish between COVID-19 patient coughs and several types of non-COVID-19 coughs with over 90\% accuracy. AI4COVID-19's performance is likely to improve as more and better data becomes available. This paper presents a proof of concept to encourage controlled clinical trials and serves as a call for labeled cough data. AI4COVID-19 is not designed to compete with clinical testing. Instead, it offers a complementing tele-testing tool deployable anytime, anywhere, by anyone, so clinical-testing and treatment can be channeled to those who need it the most, thereby saving more lives.},

While a few recent works have been done on on-body sensor and smartphone sensor based lung activity detection, designing a comprehensive architecture for the detection and characterization of abnormal lung sounds (e.g., wheeze) is an open issue. In this paper, we present mLung++, which is a comprehensive pulmonary care system for respiration cycle based detection and subsequent characterization of wheezing in chronic pulmonary patients using audio and inertial sensors embedded on a smartphone. For the design, training, and evaluation, we use audio and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data collected by smartphone and watch from 131 human subjects (91 pulmonary patients, 40 healthy control). We show empirical evidence that the performance of mLung++ for characterizing abnormal lung sounds (accuracy 93.4\% and f1\_score 77.94\%) is comparable with that of high-quality on-body sensor based characterization, which is usually done in a hospital or clinical setup.},

	abstract = {The prevalence of smart devices has enabled remote health monitoring outside of conventional clinical settings, and has reduced health care delivery cost. Passive audio recording is an essential component in remote health monitoring, however, it poses major privacy issues for subjects in uncontrolled environments like their home. There are existing voice activity detection and speech classification methodologies to identify sound events and obfuscate the human speech. However, they result in frequent false positives \$({\textgreater} {\textbackslash}pmb\{94\}{\textbackslash}\%)\$ when distinguishing human speech from other sound events; their performance is limited to a controlled environment for a specific application; and require large amount of labeled data for training. In this paper, we present a novel speech privacy preservation methodology using generative adversarial networks to segment human speech in a recorded audio and generate human-like random speech to replace the original segment. We implemented our methodology and experimented on standard datasets of speech, environmental sounds, and cough samples generated from our internal mobile health study. Compared to current methodologies, our experimental results show much lower speech segmentation true positive rates of 17\% and 14\% for environmental sounds and cough datasets. Moreover, randomly generated audio samples to obfuscate the speech are shown to be likely indistinguishable from human speech (lower than 0.9\% error in spectral attributes).},

Cough type detection is traditionally done by physical examination through hearing patients coughs in a clinical visit which is subjective and costly. This work tries to provide an objective comprehensive approach for cough type detection using an extensive set of acoustic features applied to the recorded audio from a relatively large population of both healthy subjects and patient with various pulmonary diseases and healthy controls. A total number of 5971 coughs (5242 dry and 729 wet) were collected from 131 subjects using Smartphone. Annotation was done using a crowd-source platform. Classification sensitivity and specificity values of 86\% and 84\% was achieved respectively which is the highest in literature to the best of our knowledge.},

Continuous passive monitoring of subjects using mobile sensors can help detect disease, estimate severity, track progression over time, and predict adverse exacerbation events. One of the most convenient avenues to realize this goal is through analysis of passively recorded natural speech patterns. It has been previously established that diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affect pause patterns and prosodic features of speech. In this study we present an exploration of the feasibility of using speech features from natural speech to detect pulmonary disease. Experiments were conducted on a cohort of 131 subjects: 91 with asthma and/or COPD, and 40 healthy controls. Patients and healthy subjects were differentiable with 68\% accuracy; moreover, the subset of patients with the highest disease severity were detected with 89\% accuracy.},

First, we summarize recent public urban human mobility data sets and how to clean and preprocess such data. Second, we describe recent urban human mobility models and predictors, e.g., the deep learning predictor, for predicting urban human mobility. Third, we describe how to evaluate the models and predictors. We conclude by considering how applications can utilize the mobility models and predictive tools for addressing city challenges.},

This has led to the adoption of modeling techniques from other disciplines such as kinetic theory or urban planning. Yet these techniques generate movement behavior that is often perceived as not "realistic" for humans or provides only a macroscopic view on mobility. More recent approaches infer mobility models from real traces provided by positioning technologies or by the marks the mobile users leave in the wireless network. However, there is no common framework for assessing and comparing mobilitymodels. In an attempt to provide a solid foundation for realistic mobility modeling in mobile networking research, we take an engineering approach and thoroughly discuss the required steps of model creation and validation. In this context, we survey how and to what extent existing mobility modeling approaches implement the proposed steps. This also summarizes helpful information for readers who do not want to develop a new model, but rather intend to choose among existing ones.},

	abstract = {We have shown previously that the AKT2 pathway is essential for cell survival and important in malignant transformation. In this study, we demonstrate elevated kinase levels of AKT2 and phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K) in 32 of 80 primary breast carcinomas. The majority of the cases with the activation are estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) positive, which prompted us to examine whether AKT2 regulates ERalpha activity. We found that constitutively activated AKT2 or AKT2 activated by epidermal growth factor or insulin-like growth factor-1 promotes the transcriptional activity of ERalpha. This effect occurred in the absence or presence of estrogen. Activated AKT2 phosphorylates ERalpha in vitro and in vivo, but it does not phosphorylate a mutant ERalpha in which ser-167 was replaced by Ala. The PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin, abolishes both the phosphorylation and transcriptional activity of ERalpha induced by AKT2. However, AKT2-induced ERalpha activity was not inhibited by tamoxifen but was completely abolished by ICI 164,384, implicating that AKT2-activated ERalpha contributes to tamoxifen resistance. Moreover, we found that ERalpha binds to the p85alpha regulatory subunit of PI3K in the absence or presence of estradiol in epithelial cells and subsequently activates PI3K/AKT2, suggesting ERalpha regulation of PI3K/AKT2 through a nontranscriptional and ligand-independent mechanism. These data indicate that regulation between the ERalpha and PI3K/AKT2 pathway (ERalpha-PI3K/AKT2-ERalpha) may play an important role in pathogenesis of human breast cancer and could contribute to ligand-independent breast cancer cell growth.},

	abstract = {Mobile health applications that track activities, such as exercise, sleep, and diet, are becoming widely used. While these activity tracking applications have the potential to improve our health, user engagement and retention are critical factors for their success. However, long-term user engagement patterns in real-world activity tracking applications are not yet well understood. Here we study user engagement patterns within a mobile physical activity tracking application consisting of 115 million logged activities taken by over a million users over 31 months. Specifically, we show that over 75\% of users return and re-engage with the application after prolonged periods of inactivity, no matter the duration of the inactivity. We find a surprising result that the re-engagement usage patterns resemble those of the start of the initial engagement period, rather than being a simple continuation of the end of the initial engagement period. This evidence points to a conceptual model of multiple lives of user engagement, extending the prevalent single life view of user activity. We demonstrate that these multiple lives occur because the users have a variety of different primary intents or goals for using the app. We find evidence for users being more likely to stop using the app once they achieved their primary intent or goal (e.g., weight loss). However, these users might return once their original intent resurfaces (e.g., wanting to lose newly gained weight). Based on insights developed in this work, including a marker of improved primary intent performance, our prediction models achieve 71\% ROC AUC. Overall, our research has implications for modeling user re-engagement in health activity tracking applications and has consequences for how notifications, recommendations as well as gamification can be used to increase engagement.},

	abstract = {Well-established fine-scale urban mobility models today depend on detailed but cumbersome and expensive travel surveys for their calibration. Not much is known, however, about the set of mechanisms needed to generate complete mobility profiles if only using passive datasets with mostly sparse traces of individuals. In this study, we present a mechanistic modeling framework (TimeGeo) that effectively generates urban mobility patterns with resolution of 10 min and hundreds of meters. It ties together the inference of home and work activity locations from data, with the modeling of flexible activities (e.g., other) in space and time. The temporal choices are captured by only three features: the weekly home-based tour number, the dwell rate, and the burst rate. These combined generate for each individual: (i) stay duration of activities, (ii) number of visited locations per day, and (iii) daily mobility networks. These parameters capture how an individual deviates from the circadian rhythm of the population, and generate the wide spectrum of empirically observed mobility behaviors. The spatial choices of visited locations are modeled by a rank-based exploration and preferential return (r-EPR) mechanism that incorporates space in the EPR model. Finally, we show that a hierarchical multiplicative cascade method can measure the interaction between land use and generation of trips. In this way, urban structure is directly related to the observed distance of travels. This framework allows us to fully embrace the massive amount of individual data generated by information and communication technologies (ICTs) worldwide to comprehensively model urban mobility without travel surveys.},

In this work, we define a new framework using a text compression technique on the sequences of credit card purchases to detect ubiquitous patterns of collective behavior. Clustering the consumers by their similarity in purchases sequences, we detect five consumer groups. Remarkably, post checking, individuals in each group are also similar in their age, total expenditure, gender, and the diversity of their social and mobility networks extracted by their mobile phone records. By properly deconstructing transaction data with Zipf-like distributions, this method uncovers sets of significant sequences that reveal insights on collective human behavior.},

	abstract = {Mobile sensing relies on data contributed by users through their mobile device (e.g., smart phone) to obtain useful information about people and their surroundings. However, users may not want to contribute due to lack of incentives and concerns on possible privacy leakage. To effectively promote user participation, both incentive and privacy issues should be addressed. Existing work on privacy-aware incentive is limited to special scenario of mobile sensing where each sensing task needs only one data report from each user, and thus not appropriate for generic scenarios in which sensing tasks may require multiple reports from each user (e.g., in environmental monitoring applications). In this paper, we propose a privacy-aware incentive scheme for general mobile sensing, which allows each sensing task to collect one or multiple reports from each user as needed. Besides being more flexible in task management, our scheme has much lower computation and communication cost compared to the existing solution. Evaluations show that, when each node only contributes data for a small fraction of sensing tasks (e.g, due to the incapability or disqualification to generate sensing data for other tasks), our scheme runs at least one order of magnitude faster.},

With the growing ability of collecting information, more and more tem-poral and spatial contextual information is collected in systems, and the location prediction problem becomes crucial and feasible. Some works have been proposed to address this problem, but they all have their limitations. Factorizing Personalized Markov Chain (FPMC) is con-structed based on a strong independence assumption among different factors, which limits its performance. Tensor Factorization (TF) faces the cold start problem in predicting future actions. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) model shows promising performance compar-ing with PFMC and TF, but all these methods have problem in modeling continuous time interval and ge-ographical distance. In this paper, we extend RNN and propose a novel method called Spatial Temporal Recur-rent Neural Networks (ST-RNN). ST-RNN can model local temporal and spatial contexts in each layer with time-specific transition matrices for different time inter-vals and distance-specific transition matrices for differ-ent geographical distances. Experimental results show that the proposed ST-RNN model yields significant im-provements over the competitive compared methods on two typical datasets, i.e., Global Terrorism Database (GTD) and Gowalla dataset.},

On the other hand, individuals reveal personal information for relatively small rewards, often just for drawing the attention of peers in an online social network. This inconsistency of privacy attitudes and privacy behaviour is often referred to as the “privacy paradox”. In this paper, we present the results of a review of research literature on the privacy paradox. We analyse studies that provide evidence of a paradoxical dichotomy between attitudes and behaviour and studies that challenge the existence of such a phenomenon. The diverse research results are explained by the diversity in research methods, the different contexts and the different conceptualisations of the privacy paradox. We also present several interpretations of the privacy paradox, stemming from social theory, psychology, behavioural economics and, in one case, from quantum theory. We conclude that current research has improved our understanding of the privacy paradox phenomenon. It is, however, a complex phenomenon that requires extensive further research. Thus, we call for synthetic studies to be based on comprehensive theoretical models that take into account the diversity of personal information and the diversity of privacy concerns. We suggest that future studies should use evidence of actual behaviour rather than self-reported behaviour.},

This highly dynamic and mobile setting, where humans are the central focus, presents new challenges for information security, because data originates from sensors carried by people - not tiny sensors thrown in the forest or attached to animals. In this paper we aim to instigate discussion of this critical issue, because opportunistic people-centric sensing will never succeed without adequate provisions for security and privacy. To that end, we outline several important challenges and suggest general solutions that hold promise in this new sensing paradigm.},

In behavior prediction, destination prediction (e.g. predicting a future location) can be applied to various practical applications. ï¿¿e problem is how to predict a destination with high accuracy in the early stage of movement. We call this problem " early destination prediction with trajectory tracking " . Currently, there are two destination prediction methods. One is Next Place Prediction(NPP), that is based on the staying paï¿¿ern such as at which location does a user frequently stay at a certain time of day. ï¿¿e other is prediction based on trajectory tracking. In the former, it is impossible to narrow down the destination by the route. In the laï¿¿er, it is diï¿¿cult to predict with high accuracy the early stage of movement.

With such data, predicting human mobility at the city level will be of great significance for transportation scheduling, urban regulation, and emergency management. In particular, most urban human behaviors are related to a small number of important regions, referred to as Regions-of-Interest (ROIs). Therefore, in this study, a deep ROI-based modeling approach is proposed for effectively predicting urban human mobility. Urban ROIs are first discovered from historical trajectory data, and urban human mobility is designated using two types of ROI labels (ISROI and WHICHROI). Then, urban mobility prediction is modeled as a sequence classification problem for each type of label. Finally, a deep-learning architecture built with recurrent neural networks is designed as an effective sequence classifier. Experimental results demonstrate that the superior performance of our proposed approach to the baseline models and several real-world practices show the applicability of our approach to real-world urban computing problems.},

Using deep packet inspection at the network operator level, we obtained a geo-tagged dataset with more than 6 million unique devices that launched more than 10,000 unique applications across the city of Shanghai over one week. We develop a technique that leverages transfer learning to predict which applications are most popular and estimate the whole usage distribution based on the Point of Interest (POI) information of that particular location. We demonstrate that our technique has an 83.0\% hitrate in successfully identifying the top five popular applications, and a 0.15 RMSE when estimating usage with just 10\% sampled sparse data. It outperforms by about 25.7\% over the existing state-of-the-art approaches. Our findings pave the way for predicting which apps are relevant to a user given their current location, and which applications are popular where. The implications of our findings are broad: it enables a range of systems to benefit from such timely predictions, including operating systems, network operators, appstores, advertisers, and service providers.},

Inferences stemming from such minimal information can be quite accurate, and nonverbal behavior plays an important role in the impression formation. Because protagonists are strangers, employment interviews are a case where both nonverbal behavior and thin slices can be predictive of outcomes. In this work, we analyze the predictive validity of thin slices of real job interviews, where slices are defined by the sequence of questions in a structured interview format. We approach this problem from an audio-visual, dyadic, and nonverbal perspective, where sensing, cue extraction, and inference are automated. Our study shows that although nonverbal behavioral cues extracted from thin slices were not as predictive as when extracted from the full interaction, they were still predictive of hirability impressions with R2 values up to 0.34, which was comparable to the predictive validity of human observers on thin slices. Applicant audio cues were found to yield the most accurate results.},

In this paper, we present an empirical study of the correlation between user mobility and app usage patterns. In particular, we focus on users' moving speed as the key mobility metric, and try to answer the following question: are there any notable relations between moving speed and the app usage patterns? Our study is based on a real-world, large-scale dataset of 2G phone network data request records. A critical challenge was that the raw data records are rather coarse-grained. More specifically, unlike GPS traces, the exact locations of users were not readily available. We inferred users' approximate locations according to their interactions with nearby cell towers, whose locations were known. We proposed a novel method to filter out noises and perform reliable speed estimation. We verify our methodology with out of sample data and show its improvement in speed estimation accuracy. We then examined several aspects of mobile data usage patterns, including the data volume, the access frequency, and the app categories, to reveal the correlation between these patterns and users' moving speed. Experimental results based on our large-scale real-world datasets revealed that users under different mobility categories not only have different smartphone usage motivations but also have different ways of using their smartphones.},

	abstract = {Access to financial institutions is difficult in developing economies and especially for the poor. However, the widespread adoption of mobile phones has enabled the development of mobile money systems that deliver financial services through the mobile phone network. Despite the success of mobile money, there is a lack of quantitative studies that unveil which factors contribute to the adoption and sustained usage of such services. In this paper, we describe the results of a quantitative study that analyzes data from the world's leading mobile money service, M-Pesa. We analyzed millions of anonymized mobile phone communications and M-Pesa transactions in an African country. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we analyze the customers' usage of M-Pesa and report large-scale patterns of behavior; (2) we present the results of applying machine learning models to predict mobile money adoption (AUC=0.691), and mobile money spending (AUC=0.619) using multiple data sources: mobile phone data, M-Pesa agent information, the number of M-Pesa friends in the user's social network, and the characterization of the user's geographic location; (3) we discuss the most predictive features in both models and draw key implications for the design of mobile money services in a developing country. We find that the most predictive features are related to mobile phone activity, to the presence of M-Pesa users in a customer's ego-network and to mobility. We believe that our work will contribute to the understanding of the factors playing a role in the adoption and sustained usage of mobile money services in developing economies.},

	abstract = {Submarine channel avulsion is a fundamental process in the evolution of submarine fans that records abrupt changes in the sediment dispersal patterns, and the development of sand-rich splay deposits. On passive margins, changing flow conditions have been invoked to explain the location and timing of channel avulsion. On tectonically active basin margins, processes such as seismic activity, seabed faulting and folding and emplacement of mass-transport complexes (MTCs) are additional triggers. This study is based on the detailed mapping and interpretation of the first 1000m below seabed of a 1900km23D seismic volume in the southern Magdalena Fan, offshore Colombia, a tectonically-active margin. The emplacement of a large MTC deposit ({\textgreater}400km2in area and 200m in thickness) is interpreted to have controlled the avulsion node of a major channel-levee complex-set and influenced the evolution of the subsequent avulsion lobe complex-set. The basal surface of the MTC is highly erosional resulting in net degradation of the seascape. Substrate entrainment by the MTC left behind a narrow erosional remnant ridge that formed a bathymetric anomaly upon which a channel-levee complex-set developed. The irregular levee geometries above the remnant ridge led to instability and levee collapse prior to channel avulsion. Map view geometries and seismic amplitude extractions suggest that the initial avulsion lobes were mud-prone and relatively erratically distributed, and evolved to form well-defined sand-prone lobes. The distribution, morphology and evolution of the avulsion lobe complexes were strongly influenced by the bathymetric anomalies on the MTC top surface which, are generally coincident with protruding megaclasts. The role of MTC emplacement in triggering submarine channel avulsion and the development of sand-prone deposits in proximal locations has important implications for hydrocarbon exploration and production. This study serves as a high-resolution, shallow-subsurface analogue for less well-imaged avulsion cycles on tectonically-active basin margins that are prone to MTCs.},

In this paper, we study a critical problem in MCS systems, namely, incentivizing user participation. Different from existing work, we incorporate a crucial metric, called users’ quality of information (QoI), into our incentive mechanisms for MCS systems. Due to various fac- tors (e.g., sensor quality, noise, etc.) the quality of the sensory data contributed by individual users varies significantly. Obtaining high quality data with little expense is always the ideal of MCS platforms. Technically, we design incentive mechanisms based on reverse combinatorial auctions. We investigate both the single- minded and multi-minded combinatorial auction models. For the former, we design a truthful, individual rational and computation- ally efficient mechanism that approximately maximizes the social welfare with a guaranteed approximation ratio. For the latter, we design an iterative descending mechanism that achieves close-to- optimal social welfare while satisfying individual rationality and computational efficiency. Through extensive simulations, we vali- date our theoretical analysis about the close-to-optimal social wel- fare and fast running time of our mechanisms.},

In a mobile phone sensing system, the platform re-cruits smartphone users to provide sensing service. Existing mobile phone sensing applications and systems lack good incentive mechanisms that can attract more user participa-tion. To address this issue, we design incentive mechanisms for mobile phone sensing. We consider two system models: the platform-centric model where the platform provides a reward shared by participating users, and the user-centric model where users have more control over the payment they will receive. For the platform-centric model, we design an incentive mechanism using a Stackelberg game, where the platform is the leader while the users are the followers. We show how to compute the unique Stackelberg Equilibrium, at which the utility of the platform is maximized, and none of the users can improve its utility by unilaterally deviating from its current strategy. For the user-centric model, we design an auction-based incentive mechanism, which is com-putationally efficient, individually rational, profitable, and truthful. Through extensive simulations, we evaluate the performance and validate the theoretical properties of our incentive mechanisms.},

We find and highlight three themes that connect diverse insights from the literature. First, characterizing a single unifying economic theory of privacy is hard, because privacy issues of economic relevance arise in widely diverse contexts. Second, there are theoretical and empirical situations where the protection of privacy can both enhance, and detract from, individual and societal welfare. Third, in digital economies, consumers' ability to make informed decisions about their privacy is severely hindered, because consumers are often in a position of imperfect or asymmetric information regarding when their data is collected, for what purposes, and with what consequences.

For instance, even after a week with access to the permission manager, participants benefited from nudges showing them how often some of their sensitive data was be-ing accessed by apps, with 95\% of participants reassessing their permissions, and 58\% of them further restricting some of their permissions. We discuss how participants interacted both with the permission manager and the privacy nudges, analyze the effective-ness of both solutions, and derive some recommendations.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of identifying a small set of privacy profiles as a way of helping users manage their mobile app privacy preferences. Our analysis does not limit itself to looking at permissions people feel comfortable granting to an app. Instead it relies on static code analysis to determine the purpose for which an app requests each of its permissions, distinguishing for instance between apps relying on particular permissions to deliver their core functionality and apps requesting these permissions to share information with advertising networks or social networks. Using privacy preferences that reflect people’s comfort with the purpose for which different apps request their permissions, we use clustering techniques to identify privacy profiles. A major contribution of this work is to show that, while people’s mobile app privacy preferences are diverse, it is possible to identify a small number of privacy profiles that collectively do a good job at capturing these diverse preferences.{\textbackslash}r{\textbackslash}n},

In this work, we review a variety of incentive mechanisms that motivate people to contribute to a CS effort. We then establish a set of design constraints or minimum requirements that any incentive mechanism for CS must have. These design constrains are then used as metrics to evaluate those approaches and determine their advantages and disadvantages. We also contribute a taxonomy of CS incentive mechanisms and show how current systems fit within this taxonomy. We conclude with the identification of new types of incentive mechanisms that require further investigation.},

The TROIKA framework has high estimation accuracy and is robust to strong motion artifacts. Many variants can be straightforwardly derived from this framework. Experimental results on datasets recorded from 12 subjects during fast running at the peak speed of 15 km/h showed that the average absolute error of heart rate estimation was 2.34 beat per minute, and the Pearson correlation between the estimates and the ground truth of heart rate was 0.992.

	abstract = {Stress plays a critical role in our lives, impacting our productivity and our long-term physiological and psychological well-being. This has motivated the development of stress monitoring solutions to better understand stress, its impact on productivity and teamwork, and help users adapt their habits toward more sustainable stress levels. However, today’s stress monitoring solutions remain obtrusive, requiring active user participation (e.g., self-reporting), interfering with people’s daily activities, and often adding more burden to users looking to reduce their stress. In this paper, we introduce WiStress, the first system that can passively monitor a user’s stress levels by relying on wireless signals. WiStress does not require users to actively provide input or to wear any devices on their bodies. It operates by transmitting ultra-low-power wireless signals and measuring their reflections off the user’s body. WiStress introduces two key innovations. First, it presents the first machine learning network that can accurately and robustly extract heartbeat intervals (IBI’s) from wireless reflections without constraints on a user’s daily activities. Second, it introduces a stress classification framework that combines the extracted heartbeats with other wirelessly captured stress-related features in order to infer a subject’s stress level. We built a prototype of WiStress and tested it on 22 different subjects across different environments in both stress-induced and free-living conditions. Our results demonstrate that WiStress has high accuracy (84\%-95\%) in inferring a person’s stress level in a fully-automated way, paving the way for ubiquitous sensing systems that can monitor stress and provide feedback to improve productivity, health, and well-being.

More importantly, cStress was trained using data collected from a rigorous lab study with 21 participants and validated on two independently collected data sets — in a lab study on 26 participants and in a week-long ﬁeld study with 20 participants. In testing, the model obtains a recall of 89\% and a false positive rate of 5\% on lab data. On ﬁeld data, the model is able to predict each instantaneous self-report with an accuracy of 72\%.},

Traditionally breathing is monitored using specialized devices such as chestband or spirometers which are uncomfortable for daily use. Recent works show the feasibility of estimating breathing rate using earbuds’ motion sensors. However, non-breathing head motion is one of the biggest challenges for breathing rate estimation using earbuds. In this paper, we propose algorithms to estimate breathing rate in presence of non-breathing head motion using inertial sensors embedded in commodity earbuds. Using the chestband as a reference device, we show that our algorithms can estimate breathing rate in resting positions with error rate 2.34 breaths per minute (BPM). Our algorithms can handle passive head motion and reduce the error by 27.78\%. Furthermore, our algorithms can handle active head motion and help reduce the error by 45.70\% when intentional non-breathing head motion is present in the data segment. It can be a big stride towards passive breathing monitoring in daily life using commodity earbuds.},

	abstract = {Healthy biological systems exhibit complex patterns of variability that can be described by mathematical chaos. Heart rate variability (HRV) consists of changes in the time intervals between consecutive heartbeats called interbeat intervals (IBIs). A healthy heart is not a metronome. The oscillations of a healthy heart are complex and constantly changing, which allow the cardiovascular system to rapidly adjust to sudden physical and psychological challenges to homeostasis. This article briefly reviews current perspectives on the mechanisms that generate 24 h, short-term ({\textasciitilde}5 min), and ultra-short-term ({\textless}5 min) HRV, the importance of HRV, and its implications for health and performance. The authors provide an overview of widely-used HRV time-domain, frequency-domain, and non-linear metrics. Time-domain indices quantify the amount of HRV observed during monitoring periods that may range from {\textasciitilde}2 min to 24 h. Frequency-domain values calculate the absolute or relative amount of signal energy within component bands. Non-linear measurements quantify the unpredictability and complexity of a series of IBIs. The authors survey published normative values for clinical, healthy, and optimal performance populations. They stress the importance of measurement context, including recording period length, subject age, and sex, on baseline HRV values. They caution that 24 h, short-term, and ultra-short-term normative values are not interchangeable. They encourage professionals to supplement published norms with findings from their own specialized populations. Finally, the authors provide an overview of HRV assessment strategies for clinical and optimal performance interventions.},

	doi = {10.1109/TAFFC.2019.2927337},
	abstract = {This review investigates the effects of psychological stress on the human body measured through biosignals. When a potentially threatening stimulus is perceived, a cascade of physiological processes occurs mobilizing the body and nervous system to confront the imminent threat and ensure effective adaptation. Biosignals that can be measured reliably in relation to such stressors include physiological (EEG, ECG, EDA, EMG) and physical measures (respiratory rate, speech, skin temperature, pupil size, eye activity). A fundamental objective in this area of psychophysiological research is to establish reliable biosignal indices that reveal the underlying physiological mechanisms of the stress response. Motivated by the lack of comprehensive guidelines on the relationship between the multitude of biosignal features used in the literature and their corresponding behaviour during stress, in this paper, the impact of stress to multiple bodily responses is surveyed. Emphasis is put on the efficiency, robustness and consistency of biosignal data features across the current state of knowledge in stress detection. It is also explored multimodal biosignal analysis and modelling methods for deriving accurate stress correlates. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review on biosignal patterns caused during stress conditions and reliable practical guidelines towards more efficient detection of stress.},

	abstract = {Objective
Physical or mental imbalance caused by harmful stimuli can induce stress to maintain homeostasis. During chronic stress, the sympathetic nervous system is hyperactivated, causing physical, psychological, and behavioral abnormalities. At present, there is no accepted standard for stress evaluation. This review aimed to survey studies providing a rationale for selecting heart rate variability (HRV) as a psychological stress indicator.


Methods
Term searches in the Web of Science®, National Library of Medicine (PubMed), and Google Scholar databases yielded 37 publications meeting our criteria. The inclusion criteria were involvement of human participants, HRV as an objective psychological stress measure, and measured HRV reactivity.


Results
In most studies, HRV variables changed in response to stress induced by various methods. The most frequently reported factor associated with variation in HRV variables was low parasympathetic activity, which is characterized by a decrease in the high-frequency band and an increase in the low-frequency band. Neuroimaging studies suggested that HRV may be linked to cortical regions (e.g., the ventromedial prefrontal cortex) that are involved in stressful situation appraisal.


Conclusion
In conclusion, the current neurobiological evidence suggests that HRV is impacted by stress and supports its use for the objective assessment of psychological health and stress.},

Using a data set involving 52 adults (26 couples) living in a community for over a year, we find that social behavior measured via face-to-face interaction, call, and SMS logs, can be used to predict the spending behavior for couples in terms of their propensity to explore diverse businesses, become loyal customers, and overspend. Our results show that mobile phone based social interaction patterns can provide more predictive power on spending behavior than often-used personality based features.

Taking inspiration from animal behavior studies that have reported significant interconnections between animal spatio-temporal "foraging" behavior and their life outcomes, we analyzed a corpus of hundreds of thousands of human economic transactions and found that financial outcomes for individuals are intricately linked with their spatio-temporal traits like exploration, engagement, and elasticity.

Such understanding can answer epistemological questions on human behavior in a data-driven manner, and provide prescriptive guidelines for persuading humans to undertake certain actions in real-world social scenarios. The growing number of works in this subfield has the potential to impact multiple walks of human life including health, wellness, productivity, mobility, transportation, education, shopping, and sustenance. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we provide a functional survey of recent advances in sensing, understanding, and shaping human behavior, focusing on real-world behavior of users as measured using passive sensors. Second, we present a case study on how trust, which is an important building block of computational social systems, can be quantified, sensed, and applied to shape human behavior. Our findings suggest that: 1) trust can be operationalized and predicted via computational methods (passive sensing and network analysis) and 2) trust has a significant impact on social persuasion; in fact, it was found to be significantly more effective than the closeness of ties in determining the amount of behavior change.},

In this paper, for the first time, we carry out a causality study to investigate the causal links between users’ emotional states and their interaction with mobile phones, which could provide valuable information to practitioners and researchers. The analysis is based on a dataset collected in-the-wild. We recorded 5,118 mood reports from 28 users over a period of 20 days. Our results show that users’ emotions have a causal impact on different aspects of mobile phone interaction. On the other hand, we can observe a causal impact of the use of specific applications, reflecting the external users’ context, such as socializing and traveling, on happiness and stress level. This study has profound implications for the design of interactive mobile systems since it identifies the dimensions that have causal effects on users’ interaction with mobile phones and vice versa. These findings might lead to the design of more effective computing systems and services that rely on the analysis of the emotional state of users, for example for marketing and digital health applications.},

However, there is growing evidence of problematic use of smartphones that impacts both social and heath aspects of users’ lives. Currently, assessment of overuse or problematic use depends on one-time, self-reported behavioral information about phone use. Due to the known issues with self-reports in such types of assessments, we explore an automated, objective and repeatable approach for assessing problematic usage. We collect a wide range of phone usage data from smartphones, identify a number of usage features that are relevant to this assessment, and build detection models based on Adaboost with machine learning algorithms automatically detecting problematic use. We found that the number of apps used per day, the ratio of SMSs to calls, the number of event-initiated sessions, the number of apps used per event initiated session, and the length of non-event- initiated sessions are useful for detecting problematic usage. With these, a detection model can identify users with problematic usage with 89.6\% accuracy (F-score of .707).},

Manufacturers design phones for the broadest audience and hope they work for all users. Researchers mostly analyze data from smartphone-based user studies and report results without accounting for the many different groups of people that make up the user base of smartphones. In this work, we challenge these elementary characterizations of smartphone users and show evidence of the existence of a much more diverse set of users. We analyzed one month of application usage from 106,762 Android users and discovered 382 distinct types of users based on their application usage behaviors, using our own two-step clustering and feature ranking selection approach. Our results have profound implications on the reproducibility and reliability of mobile computing studies, design and development of applications, determination of which apps should be pre-installed on a smartphone and, in general, on the smartphone usage experience for different types of users.},

We tested the activity recognition system using over 12 hours of wearable-sensor data collected by volunteers in natural unconstrained environments. The models succeeded in identifying a small set of maximally informative features, and were able identify ten different human activities with an accuracy of 95\%.},

In contrast to previous cycle modeling methods, CyHMMs deal with a number of challenges encountered in modeling real-world cycles: they can model multivariate data with discrete and continuous dimensions; they explicitly model and are robust to missing data; and they can share information across individuals to model variation both within and between individual time series. Experiments on synthetic and real-world health-tracking data demonstrate that CyHMMs infer cycle lengths more accurately than existing methods, with 58\% lower error on simulated data and 63\% lower error on real-world data compared to the best-performing baseline. CyHMMs can also perform functions which baselines cannot: they can model the progression of individual features/symptoms over the course of the cycle, identify the most variable features, and cluster individual time series into groups with distinct characteristics. Applying CyHMMs to two real-world health-tracking datasets -- of menstrual cycle symptoms and physical activity tracking data -- yields important insights including which symptoms to expect at each point during the cycle. We also find that people fall into several groups with distinct cycle patterns, and that these groups differ along dimensions not provided to the model. For example, by modeling missing data in the menstrual cycles dataset, we are able to discover a medically relevant group of birth control users even though information on birth control is not given to the model.},

With the wide availability of smartphones equipped with microphone, accelerometer, GPS, and other source of sensors, it is worthwhile to explore the possibility of automatic emotion detection via smartphone sensing. Particularly, we focus on a novel research problem that tries to detect the compound emotion (a set of multiple dimensional basic emotions) of smartphone users. We observe that users' self-reported emotional states have high correlation with their smartphone usage patterns and sensing data. Based on the observations, we exploit a feature extraction and selection algorithm to find the most significant features. We further adopt a factor graph model to tackle the correlations between features and emotion labels, and propose a machine learning algorithm for compound emotion detection based on the smartphone sensing data. The proposed mechanism is implemented as an APP called MoodExplorer in Android platform. Extensive experiments conducted on the smartphone data collected from 30 university students show that MoodExplorer can recognize users' compound emotions with 76.0\% exact match on average.},

Here we study the trajectory of 100,000 anonymized mobile phone users whose position is tracked for a six-month period. We find that, in contrast with the random trajectories predicted by the prevailing L\{é\}vy flight and random walk models, human trajectories show a high degree of temporal and spatial regularity, each individual being characterized by a time-independent characteristic travel distance and a significant probability to return to a few highly frequented locations. After correcting for differences in travel distances and the inherent anisotropy of each trajectory, the individual travel patterns collapse into a single spatial probability distribution, indicating that, despite the diversity of their travel history, humans follow simple reproducible patterns. This inherent similarity in travel patterns could impact all phenomena driven by human mobility, from epidemic prevention to emergency response, urban planning and agent-based modelling.},

	abstract = {The recent arrival of smartphone-sensing methods has made it possible to objectively track consequential everyday health-related behaviors rather than rely on self-reports. To evaluate the viability of using sensing methods to monitor such behaviors in detail, the present research used a smartphone-sensing application to describe the patterns of stability and change that characterize a cohort of students' activity and sociability behaviors over the course of a 10-week academic term. Data were collected from 48 students using a smartphone-sensing application, StudentLife, which was designed to track daily durations of activity (via the accelerometer sensor) and sociability (via the microphone sensor). Results showed stability estimates were moderate to high for activity (rmean= 0.66) and sociability (rmean= 0.72) across the 10 weeks. Students started the term with generally healthy levels of activity (M = 1.87 h) and sociability (M = 4.99 h), which then dropped (activity by 0.42 h, sociability by 0.90 h) over the first half of the term (i.e., before midterm exams). Over the second half of the term, activity levels did not change but sociability increased (by 0.88 h). Students’ ethnicity and academic class predicted variation in the activity and sociability trajectories. Discussion focuses on the implications of our results for designing mHealth interventions to address consequential student outcomes (e.g., mental health, physical health).},

Furthermore, we propose a neural network-based permutation-invariant aggregation operator that corresponds to the attention mechanism. Notably, an application of the proposed attention-based operator provides insight into the contribution of each instance to the bag label. We show empirically that our approach achieves comparable performance to the best MIL methods on benchmark MIL datasets and it outperforms other methods on a MNIST-based MIL dataset and two real-life histopathology datasets without sacrificing interpretability.},

More recently, end-to-end classification systems in image and auditory recognition systems have been developed to learn features jointly with classification and result in improved classification accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end deep neural network to map the raw waveform inputs to sound class labels. Our network includes an "inception nucleus" that optimizes the size of convolutional filters on the fly that results in reducing engineering efforts dramatically. Classification results compared favorably against current state-of-the-art approaches, besting them by 10.4 percentage points on the Urbansound8k dataset. Analyses of learned representations revealed that filters in the earlier hidden layers learned wavelet-like transforms to extract features that were informative for classification.},

Two experiments with a total of ten test subjects performed six daily activities were conducted in this study: one with a device fixed on the waist in sixteen different orientations and another with three different device locations (i.e., shirt-pocket, trouser-pocket and waist) in two different device orientations. For handling with varying device orientations, a projection-based method for device coordinate system estimation has been proposed. Based on the dataset with sixteen different device orientations, the experimental results have illustrated that the proposed method is efficient for rectifying the acceleration signals into the same coordinate system, yielding significantly improved activity recognition accuracy. After signal transformation, the recognition results of signals acquired from different device locations are compared. The experimental results show that when the sensor is placed on different rigid body, different models are required for certain activities. © 2011 IEEE.},

            Increased stability in one’s daily routine is associated with well-being in the general population and often a goal of behavioral interventions for people with serious mental illnesses like schizophrenia. Assessing behavioral stability has been limited in clinical research by the use of retrospective scales, which are susceptible to reporting biases and memory inaccuracies. Mobile passive sensors, which are less susceptible to these sources of error, have emerged as tools to assess behavioral patterns in a range of populations. The present study developed and examined a metric of behavioral stability from data generated by a passive sensing system carried by 61 individuals with schizophrenia for one year. This metric—the Stability Index—appeared orthogonal from existing measures drawn from passive sensors and matched the predictive performance of state-of-the-art features. Specifically, greater stability in social activity (e.g., calls and messages) were associated with lower symptoms, and greater stability in physical activity (e.g., being still) appeared associated with elevated symptoms. This study provides additional support for the predictive value of individualized over population-level data in psychiatric populations. The Stability Index offers also a promising tool for generating insights about the impact of behavioral stability in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders.},

	abstract = {Heart rate is one of the most important vital signals for personal health tracking. A number of smartphone-based heart rate estimation systems have been proposed over the years. However, they either depend on special hardware sensors or suffer from the high noise due to the weakness of the heart signals, affecting their accuracy in many practical scenarios. Inspired by medical studies about the heart motion mechanics, we propose the HeartSense heart rate estimation system. Specifically, we show that the gyroscope sensor is the most sensitive sensor for measuring the heart rate. To further counter noise and handle different practical scenarios, we introduce a novel quality metric that allows us to fuse the different gyroscope axes in a probabilistic framework to achieve a robust and accurate estimate. We have implemented and evaluated our system on different Android phones. Results using 836 experiments on different subjects in practical scenarios with a side-by-side comparison with other systems show that HeartSense can achieve 1.03 bpm median absolute error for heart rate estimation. This is better than the state-of-the-art by more than 147\% in median error, highlighting HeartSense promise as a ubiquitous system for medical and personal well-being applications.},

Most of the DFGR systems are designed based on machine learning. However, the recognition performance will drop dramatically when the testing condition is different with the training one. Inspired by the transferrable knowledge learning ability of humans, this paper develops a practical DFGR system based on metalearning to solve the aforementioned problem. Specifically, we design a deep network which could not only learn discriminative deep features, but also learn a transferrable similarity evaluation ability from the training set and apply the learned knowledge to the new testing conditions. Extensive experiments conducted by four users in two scenarios demonstrate that the proposed system could recognize new types of gestures, or gestures performed in new conditions, with an accuracy of more than 90\%, using very few number of new samples.},

In this work, we explore the feasi- bility of sensing hand activities from commodity smart- watches, which are the most practical vehicle for achieving this vision. Our investigations started with a 50 participant, in-the-wild study, which captured hand activity labels over nearly 1000 worn hours. We then studied this data to scope our research goals and inform our technical approach. We conclude with a second, in-lab study that evaluates our clas- sification stack, demonstrating 95.2\% accuracy across 25 hand activities. Our work highlights an underutilized, yet highly complementary contextual channel that could un- lock a wide range of promising applications.},

	abstract = {Prior research has recently shown that passively collected sensor data collected within the contexts of persons daily lives via smartphones and wearable sensors can distinguish those with major depressive disorder (MDD) from controls, predict MDD severity, and predict changes in MDD severity across days and weeks. Nevertheless, very little research has examined predicting depressed mood within a day, which is essential given the large amount of variation occurring within days. The current study utilized passively collected sensor data collected from a smartphone application to future depressed mood from hour-to-hour in an ecological momentary assessment study in a sample reporting clinical levels of depression (N = 31). Using a combination of nomothetic and idiographically-weighted machine learning models, the results suggest that depressed mood can be accurately predicted from hour to hour with an average correlation between out of sample predicted depressed mood levels and observed depressed mood of 0.587, CI [0.552, 0.621]. This suggests that passively collected smartphone data can accurately predict future depressed mood among a sample reporting clinical levels of depression. If replicated in other samples, this modeling framework may allow just-in-time adaptive interventions to treat depression as it changes in the context of daily life.},

MDD has high rates of relapse and recurrence, and it has strong correlations with feelings of low social support and disrupted sleep. However, MDD is also commonly misdiagnosed by primary care providers, which leads to delayed treatment and unnecessary suffering. Changes in technology now make it possible to cheaply and effectively monitor social and sleep behaviors, offering the potential of early detection of the onset of MDD. We report on the design of Big Black Dog, a smartphone-based system for gathering data about social and sleep behaviors.

	abstract = {Stress and depression are a common affliction in all walks of life. When left unmanaged, stress can inhibit productivity or cause depression. Depression can occur independently of stress. There has been a sharp rise in mobile health initiatives to monitor stress and depression. However, these initiatives usually require users to install dedicated apps or multiple sensors, making such solutions hard to scale. Moreover, they emphasise sensing individual factors and overlook social interactions, which plays a significant role in influencing stress and depression while being a part of a social system. We present StressMon, a stress and depression detection system that leverages single-attribute location data, passively sensed from the WiFi infrastructure. Using the location data, it extracts a detailed set of movement, and physical group interaction pattern features without requiring explicit user actions or software installation on client devices. These features are used in two different machine learning models to detect stress and depression. To validate StressMon, we conducted three different longitudinal studies at a university with different groups of students, totalling up to 108 participants. Our evaluation demonstrated StressMon detecting severely stressed students with a 96.01\% True Positive Rate (TPR), an 80.76\% True Negative Rate (TNR), and a 0.97 area under the ROC curve (AUC) score (a score of 1 indicates a perfect binary classifier) using a 6-day prediction window. In addition, StressMon was able to detect depression at 91.21\% TPR, 66.71\% TNR, and 0.88 AUC using a 15-day window. We end by discussing how StressMon can expand CSCW research, especially in areas involving collaborative practices for mental health management.},

Moreover, we explore the relationship between social distances on the communication network and the number of encounters and show that larger number of encounters indicates shorter social distances in a social network.

However, feature extraction for characterizing human mobility remains a heuristic process that relies on the domain knowledge of the condition under consideration. Moreover, we do not have guarantees that these "hand-crafted" metrics are able to eï¿¿ectively capture mobility behavior of users. Indeed, informative emerging patterns in the data might not be characterized by them. This is also a complex and often time-consuming task, since it usually consists of a lengthy trial-and-error process. In this paper, we investigate the potential of using autoencoders for automatically extracting features from the raw input data. Through a series of experiments we show the eï¿¿ectiveness of autoencoder-based features for predicting depressive states of individuals compared to "hand-crafted" ones. Our results show that automatically extracted features lead to an improvement of the performance of the prediction models, while, at the same time, reducing the complexity of the feature design task.

	abstract = {Depression is a common mood disorder that causes severe medical problems and interferes negatively with daily life. Identifying human behavior patterns that are predictive or indicative of depressive disorder is important. Clinical diagnosis of depression relies on costly clinician assessment using survey instruments which may not objectively reflect the fluctuation of daily behavior. Self-administered surveys, such as the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS) commonly used to monitor depression, may show disparities from clinical decision. Smartphones provide easy access to many behavioral parameters, and Fitbit wrist bands are becoming another important tool to assess variables such as heart rates and sleep efficiency that are complementary to smartphone sensors. However, data used to identify depression indicators have been limited to a single platform either iPhone, or Android, or Fitbit alone due to the variation in their methods of data collection. The present work represents a large-scale effort to collect and integrate data from mobile phones, wearable devices, and self reports in depression analysis by designing a new machine learning approach. This approach constructs sparse mappings from sensing variables collected by various tools to two separate targets: self-reported QIDS scores and clinical assessment of depression severity. We propose a so-called heterogeneous multi-task feature learning method that jointly builds inference models for related tasks but of different types including classification and regression tasks. The proposed method was evaluated using data collected from 103 college students and could predict the QIDS score with an R2 reaching 0.44 and depression severity with an F1-score as high as 0.77. By imposing appropriate regularizers, our approach identified strong depression indicators such as time staying at home and total time asleep.},

	abstract = {Background: Depression is a burdensome, recurring mental health disorder with high prevalence. Even in developed countries, patients have to wait for several months to receive treatment. In many parts of the world there is only one mental health professional for over 200 people. Smartphones are ubiquitous and have a large complement of sensors that can potentially be useful in monitoring behavioral patterns that might be indicative of depressive symptoms and providing context-sensitive intervention support. Objective: The objective of this study is 2-fold, first to explore the detection of daily-life behavior based on sensor information to identify subjects with a clinically meaningful depression level, second to explore the potential of context sensitive intervention delivery to provide in-situ support for people with depressive symptoms. Methods: A total of 126 adults (age 20-57) were recruited to use the smartphone app Mobile Sensing and Support (MOSS), collecting context-sensitive sensor information and providing just-in-time interventions derived from cognitive behavior therapy. Real-time learning-systems were deployed to adapt to each subject's preferences to optimize recommendations with respect to time, location, and personal preference. Biweekly, participants were asked to complete a self-reported depression survey (PHQ-9) to track symptom progression. Wilcoxon tests were conducted to compare scores before and after intervention. Correlation analysis was used to test the relationship between adherence and change in PHQ-9. One hundred twenty features were constructed based on smartphone usage and sensors including accelerometer, Wifi, and global positioning systems (GPS). Machine-learning models used these features to infer behavior and context for PHQ-9 level prediction and tailored intervention delivery. Results: A total of 36 subjects used MOSS for ≥2 weeks. For subjects with clinical depression (PHQ-9≥11) at baseline and adherence ≥8 weeks (n=12), a significant drop in PHQ-9 was observed (P=.01). This group showed a negative trend between adherence and change in PHQ-9 scores (rho=−.498, P=.099). Binary classification performance for biweekly PHQ-9 samples (n=143), with a cutoff of PHQ-9≥11, based on Random Forest and Support Vector Machine leave-one-out cross validation resulted in 60.1\% and 59.1\% accuracy, respectively. Conclusions: Proxies for social and physical behavior derived from smartphone sensor data was successfully deployed to deliver context-sensitive and personalized interventions to people with depressive symptoms. Subjects who used the app for an extended period of time showed significant reduction in self-reported symptom severity. Nonlinear classification models trained on features extracted from smartphone sensor data including Wifi, accelerometer, GPS, and phone use, demonstrated a proof of concept for the detection of depression superior to random classification. While findings of effectiveness must be reproduced in a RCT to proof causation, they pave the way for a new generation of digital health interventions leveraging smartphone sensors to provide context sensitive information for in-situ support and unobtrusive monitoring of critical mental health states.},

We extract various behavioral features from smartphone sensing data and investigate the efficacy of various machine learning tools to predict clinical diagnoses and PHQ-9 scores (a quantitative tool for aiding depression screening in practice). A notable feature of our study is that we leverage a dataset that includes clinical ground truth. We find that behavioral data from smartphones can predict clinical depression with good accuracy. In addition, combining behavioral data and PHQ-9 scores can provide prediction accuracy significantly exceeding each in isolation, indicating that behavioral data captures relevant features that are not reflected by PHQ-9 scores. Finally, we develop multi-feature regression models for PHQ-9 scores that achieve significantly improved accuracy compared to direct regression models based on single features.},

Most existing systems require an interaction with the device, for example they may require the user to input his/her mood state at regular intervals. In this paper we seek to answer whether mobile phones can be used to unobtrusively monitor individuals affected by depressive mood disorders by analyzing only their mobility patterns from GPS traces. In order to get ground-Truth measurements, we have developed a smartphone application that periodically collects the locations of the users and the answers to daily questionnaires that quantify their depressive mood. We demonstrate that there exists a significant correlation between mobility trace characteristics and the depressive moods. Finally, we present the design of models that are able to successfully predict changes in the depressive mood of individuals by analyzing their movements.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Depression is a common, burdensome, often recurring mental health disorder that frequently goes undetected and untreated. Mobile phones are ubiquitous and have an increasingly large complement of sensors that can potentially be useful in monitoring behavioral patterns that might be indicative of depressive symptoms. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to explore the detection of daily-life behavioral markers using mobile phone global positioning systems (GPS) and usage sensors, and their use in identifying depressive symptom severity. METHODS: A total of 40 adult participants were recruited from the general community to carry a mobile phone with a sensor data acquisition app (Purple Robot) for 2 weeks. Of these participants, 28 had sufficient sensor data received to conduct analysis. At the beginning of the 2-week period, participants completed a self-reported depression survey (PHQ-9). Behavioral features were developed and extracted from GPS location and phone usage data. RESULTS: A number of features from GPS data were related to depressive symptom severity, including circadian movement (regularity in 24-hour rhythm; r=-.63, P=.005), normalized entropy (mobility between favorite locations; r=-.58, P=.012), and location variance (GPS mobility independent of location; r=-.58, P=.012). Phone usage features, usage duration, and usage frequency were also correlated (r=.54, P=.011, and r=.52, P=.015, respectively). Using the normalized entropy feature and a classifier that distinguished participants with depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 score ≥5) from those without (PHQ-9 score {\textless}5), we achieved an accuracy of 86.5\%. Furthermore, a regression model that used the same feature to estimate the participants’ PHQ-9 scores obtained an average error of 23.5\%. CONCLUSIONS: Features extracted from mobile phone sensor data, including GPS and phone usage, provided behavioral markers that were strongly related to depressive symptom severity. While these findings must be replicated in a larger study among participants with confirmed clinical symptoms, they suggest that phone sensors offer numerous clinical opportunities, including continuous monitoring of at-risk populations with little patient burden and interventions that can provide just-in-time outreach.},

Rarely more than an arm’s length away, these sensor-rich devices can easily be repurposed to collect rich and extensive records of their users’ behaviors (e.g., location, communication, media consumption), posing serious threats to individual privacy. Here we examine the extent to which individuals’ Big Five personality dimensions can be predicted on the basis of six different classes of behavioral information collected via sensor and log data harvested from smartphones. Taking a machine-learning approach, we predict personality at broad domain (

Our cross-validated results reveal that specific patterns in behaviors in the domains of 1) communication and social behavior, 2) music consumption, 3) app usage, 4) mobility, 5) overall phone activity, and 6) day- and night-time activity are distinctively predictive of the Big Five personality traits. The accuracy of these predictions is similar to that found for predictions based on digital footprints from social media platforms and demonstrates the possibility of obtaining information about individuals’ private traits from behavioral patterns passively collected from their smartphones. Overall, our results point to both the benefits (e.g., in research settings) and dangers (e.g., privacy implications, psychological targeting) presented by the widespread collection and modeling of behavioral data obtained from smartphones.},

PPG is a non-invasive technology that uses a light source and a photodetector at the surface of skin to measure the volumetric variations of blood circulation. Recently, there has been much interest from numerous researchers around the globe to extract further valuable information from the PPG signal in addition to heart rate estimation and pulse oxymetry readings. PPG signal’s second derivative wave contains important health-related information. Thus, analysis of this waveform can help researchers and clinicians to evaluate various cardiovascular-related diseases such as atherosclerosis and arterial stiffness. Moreover, investigating the second derivative wave of PPG signal can also assist in early detection and diagnosis of various cardiovascular illnesses that may possibly appear later in life. For early recognition and analysis of such illnesses, continuous and real-time monitoring is an important approach that has been enabled by the latest technological advances in sensor technology and wireless communications. The aim of this article is to briefly consider some of the current developments and challenges of wearable PPG-based monitoring technologies and then to discuss some of the potential applications of this technology in clinical settings.},

    \Description[A table showing the difference between augmented reality devices and other non-AR devices.]{A table showing the difference between augmented reality devices (column 1) and other non-AR devices (column 2). There are three rows.
The first row is about user context. AR column says "Rich, e.g., congitive load, attention". Non-AR column says "Limited, e.g., some activities".

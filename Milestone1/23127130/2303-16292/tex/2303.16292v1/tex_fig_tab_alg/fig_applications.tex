    \Description[Application of XAIR on Two Everyday AR Scenarios.]{The figure illustrates two everyday AR scenarios of how XAIR could be applied. The left subfigure shows a scenario described in section 6.1 in the paper. In the scenario, Nanci is jogging on a quiet trial. Her AR glasses display a map beside her view and recommend a detour. Nancy is curious to know the reason why the new route is recommended. The AR glasses prompt explanations with the user goal of resolving surprise, and the system goal of user intent discovery. The right subfigure shows a scenario described in section 6.2 in the paper. In the scenario, Sarah is recommended by her AR glasses a plant fertilization reminder after chatting with her neighbor on relevant topics. She is concerned about her privacy being invaded. In this case, the system displays an explanation with the user goal of privacy awareness and the system goal of trust building. Both scenarios demonstrate how XAIR could be used to support the design of explainable interfaces in AR glasses.}

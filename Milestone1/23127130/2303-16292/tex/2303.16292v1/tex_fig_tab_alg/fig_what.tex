    \Description[The "What" Part of XAIR.]{The "What" Part of XAIR. (A) Content and (B) Detail are the two major dimensions. Content has the choice of seven categories, including Input/Output, Why/Why-Not, How, Certainty, Examples, What-If, and How-To. Detail has two choices: "Concise Explanations" and "Detailed Explanations".
Combining the literature summary and findings from Study 1 & 2, G3-G5 provide guidelines on choosing appropriate explanation categories and length.
G3. To determine personalized explanation content, consider three factors: system goal, user goal, and user profile.
G4. By default, display concise explanations by highlighting top categories. Prioritize Why, and choose other categories based on the context.
G5. Always provide users opportunities for agency with the option to explore more detailed explanations upon request.}

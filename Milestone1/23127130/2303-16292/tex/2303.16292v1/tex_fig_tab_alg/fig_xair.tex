    \Description[An overview of the XAIR framework]{An overview of the XAIR framework.
Left) A man opening a fridge and reaching out to grab something. On his left, there is an AR interface showing a recommendation of a recipe (named "Roasted Chicken with mushed cauliflower", plus a figure of the recipe) and a paragraph of explanation "Reason for suggestion: This recipe fits your high-protein diet (32g) and is made from ingredients you have in the fridge: chicken and cauliflower".
Middle) The Problem Space of XAIR, showing three sections with detailed dimensions: when to explain (availability and delivery), what to explain (content and detail), and how to explain (modality and paradigm). It also contains a list of key factors, including user status, contextual info, system goal, user goal, and user profile.
Right) A list of AR sensors, including eye tracker, face tracker, EEG, PPG, IMU, and egocentric camera.}

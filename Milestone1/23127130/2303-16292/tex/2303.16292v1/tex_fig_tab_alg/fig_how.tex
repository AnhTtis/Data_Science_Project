    \Description[The "How" Part of XAIR.]{The "How" Part of XAIR. (A) Modality and (B) Paradigm are the major dimensions. Modality has the choice of "Audio" or "Visual". Paradigm is only for the visual modality, and it is further broken down into two perspectives: format and pattern. Format has the choices of "Textual Format" or "Graphical Format". Pattern has the choices of "Implicit Pattern" or "Explicit Pattern". G6-G8 provides guidelines for proper design choices.
G6. By default, adopt the same explanation modality as that of AI output (except haptic→audio). When one modality's load is high, use the other modality.
G7. [Visual] Use text as the primary format. Only use graphics if they are easy to understand.
G8. [Visual] Use implicit patterns if content can be part of the environment. Otherwise, use explicit patterns.}

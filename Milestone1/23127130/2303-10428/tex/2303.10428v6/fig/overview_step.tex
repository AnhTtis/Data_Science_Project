\caption{Task of Visual Abductive Reasoning (VAR) and Region Conditioned Adaptation (RCA). (a). VAR aims to make the most likely hypotheses from (incomplete) observations; (b). Our RCA model learns to reason from visual details while keeping CLIP's original ability to align the image with its text description. }
%It allows our model to learn hypotheses that are consistent with the context and learns the causal associations between hypotheses and vision-linguistic observations.}

    "abstract": "Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is critical for high-speed visible light communication (VLC) transmission; however, it suffers from a high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) problem. Among PAPR reduction techniques, pre-coding methods have shown promising advantages such as signal independence and no requirement for signaling overhead. In this paper, we present a novel pre-coding method that combines discrete cosine transform (DCT) and discrete sine transform (DST) for VLC systems using OFDM. Our proposed approach, tailored specifically for intensity modulation and direct detection (IM/DD) systems, aims to further improve the PAPR reduction while preserving bit error rate (BER) performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves more than a 6 dB reduction in PAPR compared to the DCT pre-coded method without significant degradation in BER performance.",

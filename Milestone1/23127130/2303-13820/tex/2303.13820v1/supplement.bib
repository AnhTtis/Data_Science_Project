  abstract = {A model of localized classical electrons coupled to lattice degrees of freedom and, via the Coulomb interaction, to each other has been studied to gain insight into the charge and orbital ordering observed in lightly doped manganese perovskites. Expressions are obtained for the minimum energy and ionic displacements caused by given hole and electron orbital configurations. The expressions are analyzed for several hole configurations, including that experimentally observed by Yamada et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 77, 904 (1996)] in La7/8Sr1/8MnO3. We find that, although the preferred charge and orbital ordering depend sensitively on parameters, there are ranges of the parameters in which the experimentally observed hole configuration has the lowest energy. For these parameter values we also find that the energy differences between different hole configurations are on the order of the observed charge ordering transition temperature. The effects of additional strains are also studied. Some results for La1/2Ca1/2MnO3 are presented, although our model may not adequately describe this material because the high-temperature phase is metallic.},

The relative strength of the exchange and electron-phonon interactions determines whether the transition is first or second order. A giant drop in the number of current carriers during the transition, which is a consequence of local bound-pair (bipolaron) formation in the paramagnetic phase, is extremely sensitive to an external magnetic field. Below the critical temperature of the transition, , the binding of the polarons into immobile pairs competes with the ferromagnetic exchange between polarons and the localized spins on Mn ions, which tends to align the polaron moments and, therefore, breaks up those pairs. The number of carriers abruptly increases below leading to a sudden drop in resistivity. We show that the carrier-density collapse explains the colossal magnetoresistance of doped manganites close to the transition. Below , transport occurs by polaronic tunnelling, whereas at high temperatures the transport is by hopping processes. The transition is accompanied by a spike in the specific heat, as experimentally observed. The gap feature in tunnelling spectroscopy is related to the bipolaron binding energy, which depends on the ion mass. This dependence explains the giant isotope effect of the magnetization and resistivity upon substitution of for . It is shown also that the localization of polaronic carriers by disorder cannot explain the observed huge sensitivity of the transport properties to the magnetic field in doped manganites.},

Here, we studied this phonon via polarization-dependent terahertz spectroscopy. We observed softening of this mode with decreasing temperature, indicative of incipient ferroelectricity, which we explain through a model including strong anharmonicity with a quartic displacement term. In magnetic fields up to 25 T, the phonon mode splits into two modes with opposite handedness, exhibiting circular dichroism. Their frequencies display Zeeman splitting together with an overall diamagnetic shift with increasing magnetic field. Using a group-theoretical approach, we demonstrate that these observations are the result of magnetic field-induced morphic changes in the crystal symmetries through the Lorentz force exerted on the lattice ions. Thus, our Letter reveals a novel process of controlling phonon properties in a soft ionic lattice by a strong magnetic field.},

The investigation shows that the magnetoconductivity at high frequencies is anisotropic, that is; it depends on the direction between the electric and the magnetic field. A simple relationship between the transverse part of the magnetoconductivity and the parallel part of the magnetoconductivity for all magnetic fields is obtained. The magnetoconductivity for crossed electric and magnetic fields is always larger than for parallel magnetic and electric fields. As a function of the magnetic field the magnetoconductivity is a quadratic function with respect to the magnetic field for small magnetic fields, a linear function for moderate fields and saturates at high fields. As a function of frequency the magnetoconductivity increases with decreasing frequency at frequencies which are low, but in the range of applicability of the three-site model. At very high frequencies the magnetoconductivity passes into a plateau. On the plateau the magnetoconductivity becomes independent of frequency.},

At small oxygen deficiency, the classical insulator-metal (I-M) transition at a temperature Tp decreases with increasing oxygen deficiency. The low-temperature metallic behavior in darkness shows a persistent increase of the conductivity with light. This photoconductivity increases with oxygen deficiency (from a few to 60\%). At large oxygen deficiency, the films are semiconducting in darkness, from helium to room temperature and light induces a transient photoconductivity and a low-temperature I-M transition. The intriguing possibility of collective light induced magnetism is discussed.},

The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive literature review on the development towards THz communications and presents some key technologies faced in THz wireless communication systems. Firstly, despite the substantial hardware problems that have to be developed in terms of the THz solid state superheterodyne receiver, high speed THz modulators and THz antennas, the practical THz channel model and the efficient THz beamforming are also described to compensate for the severe path attenuation. Moreover, two different kinds of lab-level THz communication systems are introduced minutely, named a solid state THz communication system and a spatial direct modulation THz communication system, respectively. The solid state THz system converts intermediate frequency (IF) modulated signal to THz frequency while the direct modulation THz system allows the high power THz sources to input for approving the relatively long distance communications. Finally, we discuss several potential application scenarios as well as some vital technical challenges that will be encountered in the future THz communications.},

In this paper, we present the full magnetic and structural phase diagram for La1-xSrxMnO3 and a partial phase diagram for Pr1-ySryMnO3. At low temperatures, we observe a series of structural phase transitions evolving as a function of increasing x as follows: orthorhombic Pbn\textrightarrow mrhombohedral R3\textasciimacron\textrightarrow corthorhombic Fmm\textrightarrow mtetragonal I4/mc\textrightarrow mcubic Pm3\textasciimacron m. At higher temperatures, the orthorhombic Fmmm structural region disappears. We also identify four magnetic states (FM, A, C, and G type) evolving as a function of increasing x. The magnetic and nuclear structural transitions coincide for samples with 0.8{$<\sptilde$}x{$<\sptilde$}0.95. In the 0.5{$<\sptilde$}x{$<\sptilde$}0.9 region, resistivity and magnetic measurements show a substantial hysteresis near TN. This hysteresis of a few K is indicative of a first order antiferromagnetic transition in good agreement with the neutron diffraction results. Our data also suggest the existence of a strong competition between the ferromagnetic and A-type states for x{$\sim$}0.5, and between the C- and G-type states for x{$\sim$}0.95. A similar behavior is observed for Pr1-ySryMnO3.},

The frequency-dependent (AC) response of a general binary model is then studied by means of various approaches, including the effective-medium approximation, a scaling theory of the critical region, numerical computations using the transfer-matrix algorithm, and several exactly solvable deterministic fractal models. Transient regimes, related to singularities in the complex-frequency plane, are also investigated. Theoretical predictions are made more explicit in two specific cases, namely R-C and RL-C networks, and compared with a broad variety of experimental results, concerning, for example, granular composites, thin films, powders, microemulsions, cermets, porous ceramics and the viscoelastic properties of gels.}

It is therefore extremely important to understand the fundamental nature of such phases. The so-called stripe phase of the manganites has long been interpreted as the localization of charge at atomic sites3,4,5,6. Here, we present resistance measurements on La0.50Ca0.50MnO3 that strongly suggest that this state is in fact a prototypical charge-density wave (CDW) that undergoes collective transport. Dramatic resistance hysteresis effects and broadband noise properties are observed, both of which are typical of sliding CDW systems. Moreover, the high levels of disorder typical of manganites result in behaviour similar to that of well-known disordered CDW materials. The CDW-type behaviour of the manganite superstructure suggests that unusual transport and structural properties do not require exotic physics, but could emerge when a well-understood phase (the CDW) coexists with disorder.},

A comparison between both models is presented for the case of COVID-19 data from the USA. Both fits to the empirical data are very good, but some differences emerge between the two approaches which indicate the usefulness of having an alternative approach to the widespread SIR model.},

  abstract = {The study of the manganese oxides, widely known as manganites, that exhibit the ``colossal'' magnetoresistance effect is among the main areas of research within the area of strongly correlated electrons. After considerable theoretical effort in recent years, mainly guided by computational and mean-field studies of realistic models, considerable progress has been achieved in understanding the curious properties of these compounds. These recent studies suggest that the ground states of manganite models tend to be intrinsically inhomogeneous due to the presence of strong tendencies toward phase separation, typically involving ferromagnetic metallic and antiferromagnetic charge and orbital ordered insulating domains. Calculations of the resistivity versus temperature using mixed states lead to a good agreement with experiments. The mixed-phase tendencies have two origins: (i) electronic phase separation between phases with different densities that lead to nanometer scale coexisting clusters, and (ii) disorder-induced phase separation with percolative characteristics between equal-density phases, driven by disorder near first-order metal\textendash insulator transitions. The coexisting clusters in the latter can be as large as a micrometer in size. It is argued that a large variety of experiments reviewed in detail here contain results compatible with the theoretical predictions. The main phenomenology of mixed-phase states appears to be independent of the fine details of the model employed, since the microscopic origin of the competing phases does not influence the results at the phenomenological level. However, it is quite important to clarify the electronic properties of the various manganite phases based on microscopic Hamiltonians, including strong electron\textendash phonon Jahn\textendash Teller and/or Coulomb interactions. Thus, several issues are discussed here from the microscopic viewpoint as well, including the phase diagrams of manganite models, the stabilization of the charge/orbital/spin ordered half-doped correlated electronics (CE)-states, the importance of the naively small Heisenberg coupling among localized spins, the setup of accurate mean-field approximations, the existence of a new temperature scale T{${_\ast}$} where clusters start forming above the Curie temperature, the presence of stripes in the system, and many others. However, much work remains to be carried out, and a list of open questions is included here. It is also argued that the mixed-phase phenomenology of manganites may appear in a large variety of compounds as well, including ruthenates, diluted magnetic semiconductors, and others. It is concluded that manganites reveal such a wide variety of interesting physical phenomena that their detailed study is quite important for progress in the field of correlated electrons.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses some effects of mobile electrons in some antiferromagnetic lattices. It is shown that these electrons (or holes) always give rise to a distortion of the ground state spin arrangement, since electron transfer lowers the energy by a term of first order in the distortion angles. In the most typical cases this results in: (a) a nonzero spontaneous moment in low fields; (b) a lack of saturation in high fields; (c) simultaneous occurrence of "ferromagnetic" and "antiferromagnetic" lines in neutron diffraction patterns; (d) both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic branches in the spin wave spectra. Some of these properties have indeed been observed in compounds of mixed valency such as the manganites with low Mn4+ content. Similar considerations apply at finite temperatures, at least for the (most widespread) case where only the bottom of the carrier band is occupied at all temperatures of interest. The free energy is computed by a variational procedure, using simple carrier wave functions and an extension of the molecular field approximation. It is found that the canted arrangements are stable up to a well-defined temperature T1. Above T1 the system is either antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic, depending upon the relative amount of mobile electrons. This behavior is not qualitatively modified when the carriers which are responsible for double exchange fall into bound states around impurity ions of opposite charge. Such bound states, however, will give rise to local inhomogeneities in the spin distortion, and to diffuse magnetic peaks in the neutron diffraction pattern. The possibility of observing these peaks and of eliminating the spurious spin-wave scattering is discussed in an Appendix.},

The metal-non-metal transition takes place when the volume fraction of the metallic phase approaches the percolation threshold. It is shown that the static dielectric constant diverges near the threshold. Critical indexes are introduced which describe the behaviour of the conductivity and the dielectric constant near the threshold as functions of the volume fraction and frequency. The case of non-zero dc conductivity of dielectric regions is considered also. It is shown that all indexes describing the critical behaviour of complex conductivity can be expressed by two indexes which are known from computer and model experiments. The results of computer calculations of Webman et al. are analysed.},

The first part of the book describes the principles governing polaron and bipolaron formation in different classes of materials. The second part emphasizes distinguishing electronic-transport and optical phenomena through which polarons manifest themselves. The book concludes by extending polaron concepts to address critical aspects of four multifaceted electronic and atomic problems: large bipolarons' superconductivity, electronic switching of small-polaron semiconductors, electronically stimulated atomic desorption and diffusion of light interstitial atoms.},

The dielectric behavior appears to be associated with the hopping of polaronic charge carriers, and we can derive the field dependent hopping energy barrier from the frequency dependence of the dielectric constant.

We present a detailed investigation of this phase by means of resonant and high energy x-ray scattering along with measurements of the electrical resistivity, thermal expansion, magnetization, and specific heat. Interestingly, the data show that the metal\textendash insulator transition of lightly doped manganites is accompanied by an orbital rearrangement. The microscopic information provided by the x-ray scattering studies together with the analysis of the macroscopic properties implies that the orbital reordering maximizes the gain of double exchange energy and, at the same time, induces an insulating behaviour. The relevance of the double-exchange mechanism for the stabilization of the ferromagnetic insulating phase is further substantiated by studies of : with increasing praseodymium content, the metal\textendash insulator transition is dramatically suppressed which can naturally be explained by a reduction of the band width upon praseodymium doping.},

At the Mn K edge the symmetry-forbidden (300) reflection is observed in the whole temperature range under investigation and its integrated intensity is found to be directly connected to structural distortions. In particular, the intensity of the (300) reflection increases strongly in the cooperative Jahn-Teller distorted phase between 150 K and 270 K. The increase of the resonant intensity in this temperature regime, the rotation of the beam polarization from {$\sigma$} to {$\pi$}, the sin2-azimuthal dependence and the anomalies displayed by the lattice constants give firm experimental evidence for an orbital ordered state between 150 K and 270 K similar to that found in LaMnO3. Upon cooling, the intensity of the (300) reflection collapses at the charge ordering temperature TCO=150K and the resonant (1.5,1.5,3) superstructure reflection emerges. This reflection also displays a resonant behavior at the Mn K edge and a pronounced azimuthal dependence. However, a resonant signal is observed in the {$\sigma\sigma$} as well as in the {$\sigma\pi$} channel.

We observe that in the ordered, ``crystalline'' state there is a well-defined stop band, while in the completely disordered, glassy or ``amorphous'' state, the stop band nearly disappears. We relate the disappearance of the stop band in the disordered state to the fluctuations in the particle area density.

The anomalous magnetic properties of the perovskite-type mixed crystals La1-xSrxCoO3-{$\lambda$} are interpreted in the light of this fact. It is assumed that the tetravalent cobalt ion is always in the low-spin state in this system. It is shown how the geometry of the perovskite-type lattice lends itself to the formation of two sublattices, each consisting of a set of (111) planes, in one of which the cobalt ions are predominantly in a high-spin state and in the other in a low-spin state. Experiments indicate that the magnetic interaction between trivalent cobalt ions in the high-spin state is antiferromagnetic, whereas the interaction between the low-spin tetravalent cobalt ions and the high-spin trivalent cobalt ions is ferromagnetic. These interactions are considered in relation to modified superexchange and the semicovalent-exchange models. The ferromagnetic Co3+-CoIV interaction permits a sharp distinction to be made between the two, although there is always some ambiguity in qualitative models. Further, the ferromagnetic interaction can be understood without recourse to Zener's double-exchange mechanism.},

  abstract = {Thin terahertz (THz)-wave optical components are fundamentally important for integrated THz-wave spectroscopy and imaging systems, especially for phase manipulation devices. As described herein, a thin THz-wave phase shifter was developed using a flexible film metamaterial with high transmission and polarization independent properties. The metamaterial unit structure employs double-layer un-split ring resonators (USRRs) with a designed distance between the two layers to obtain phase retardance of \&\#x03C0;/2, thus constituting a THz-wave phase shifter. The metamaterial design keeps the transmission coefficient as high as 0.91. The phase shifter also has polarization independence due to the four-fold symmetry of the USRR structure. Because of the subwavelength feature size of the USRR, this shifter can offer benefits for manipulating the spatial profile for the THz-wave phase through design of a binary optics phase plate by arranging a USRR array. The thickness of 48 \&\#x03BC;m has benefits for developing integrated THz optics and other applications that demand compactness and flexibility. The developed film size of 5 cm \&\#x00D7; 5 cm from the device fabrication process is suitable for THz lenses or gratings of large optical components.},

The present paper reports on studies of such phenomena, carried out in Pr0.63Ca0.37MnO3, as a function of temperature, magnetic field, or time. Combining in each case magnetization and resistivity measurements, it is shown that the insulator-metal transitions induced by these three parameters can be well described by the same percolation law {$\sigma\propto$}(f-fc)s, relating electric conductivity ({$\sigma$}) to the ferromagnetic fraction (f).},

The dynamic study reveals the coexistence of two excitation branches with very different characteristics, and local modes for x=0.05. The first branch is anisotropically dispersed and is readily attributed to spin waves; the Mn spins are coupled by exchange forces, indicating a strong decrease of the antiferromagnetic interplane coupling by doping. The second branch is weakly and isotropically dispersed, which suggests a coupling induced by the hole hopping. Its unusual q-dependent intensity reveals that this excitation is associated with a very short ferromagnetic correlation length ({$\approx$}8\textendash 10 \AA ), reminiscent of a picture of mobile ``magnetic polarons.''},

Both types of excitations have a quasi-two-dimensional (2D) character. The transition is revealed by a folding of the dispersed magnon branch at q=1/8. In the metallic state, the dispersionless levels reveal ferromagnetic domains with four lattice spacings for the size along a and b. They lead to a picture of charge segregation with hole-poor domains surrounded with hole-rich paths.

Abrupt changes in the AFMR frequencies have been observed around x{$\simeq$}0.025, and were attributed to a transition between a pure antiferromagnetic and a canted state.

In La0.825Sr0.175MnO3 the ESR spectra are consistent with the ferromagnetic and metallic state. The lines of ferromagnetic resonance and ferromagnetic antiresonance can be clearly observed.

We shall see also that the instability is only slight if the degeneracy is due solely to electrons having no great influence on the binding of the molecule. We first note that if accidental degeneracy (i. e. degeneracy not caused by symmetry) is disregarded then a degenerate electronic state necessarily entails a symmetrical nuclear configuration. Thus in order to cover all cases we may first consider each possible type of symmetry separately and discuss what nuclear configurations are consistent with each symmetry. A given molecule will possess a continuous set of configurations consistent with one definite type of symmetry, and among these configurations there may be one with a minimum electronic energy. This configuration is then stable with respect to all totally symmetrical nuclear displacements (i. e. displacements which do not disturb the symmetry). We shall have to investigate its stability with respect to all other nuclear displacements.},

The charge current in ferromagnetic transition metals is carried by two non-mixing populations of sp-band Fermi-level electrons: one of majority-spin and one of minority-spin. These electrons experience spin-dependent momentum scattering with localized electrons, which originate from the spin-split d-band. The direct observation of magnetotransport under such fundamental conditions, however, requires magnetotransport measurements on the same timescale as the electron momentum scattering, which takes place in the sub-100 fs regime. Using terahertz electromagnetic probes, we directly observe the magnetotransport in a metallic system under the fundamental conditions, and determine the spin-dependent densities and momentum scattering times of conduction electrons. We show that traditional measurements significantly underestimate the spin asymmetry in electron scattering, a key parameter responsible for effects such as GMR. Furthermore, we demonstrate the possibility of magnetic modulation of terahertz waves, along with heat- and contact-free GMR readout using ultrafast terahertz signals.},

In this paper, we demonstrate that tunneling magnetoresistance can influence terahertz (THz) wave propagation through a MTJ. In particular, various magnetic configurations between parallel state and antiparallel state of the magnetizations of the ferromagnetic layers in the MTJ have the effect of changing the conductivity, making a functional modulation of the propagating THz electromagnetic fields. Operating in the THz frequency range, a maximal modulation depth of 60\% is reached for the parallel state of the MTJ with a thickness of 77.45 nm, using a magnetic field as low as 30 mT. The THz conductivity spectrum of the MTJ is governed by spin-dependent electron tunneling. It is anticipated that the MTJ device and its tunability scheme will have many potential applications in THz magnetic modulators, filtering, and sensing.},

The review of the experimental evidence includes extreme examples of highly conducting materials showing strongly dispersive behaviour, low-loss materials with a `flat', frequency-independent susceptibility, dipolar loss peaks etc. The surprising conclusion is that despite the evident complexity of the relaxation processes certain very simple relations prevail and this leads to a better insight into the nature of these processes.},

It is shown that the sign of the superexchange interaction is closely connected with the cation orbital state, when the cation is subject to the crystalline field arising from octahedrally or tetrahedrally surrounding anions. In some cases, the sign of the superexchange interaction is definitely determined from the symmetry relations. The cases in which each cation is subject to an octahedral cubic field and the lines connecting the interacting cations to the intervening anion make an angle of either 180\textdegree{} or 90\textdegree{} are discussed in particular. Our discussion of the 180\textdegree{} case is applicable to crystals of the perovskite type and NaCl type and that of the 90\textdegree{} case to anhydrous chlorides. In the case where each cation is subject to a tetrahedral cubic field, there is a definite relation between the symmetry of the cation electron orbitals and superexchange interaction, if only the s-orbital of anion participates in the superexchange interaction. TiH2 is an example of this case. The interaction between nearest-neighbor cations in the crystal of the NaCl type is also discussed.},

It is magnetic in origin, but it becomes active in response to the electric field component of light. Here we give an overview of our recent advance in the terahertz time-domain spectroscopy of electromagnons, or electric-dipole active magnetic resonances, focused on perovskite manganites\textemdash RMnO3 (R denotes rare-earth ions). The respective electric and magnetic contributions to the observed magnetic resonance are firmly identified by the measurements of the light-polarization dependence using a complete set of the crystal orientations. We extract general optical features in a variety of the spin-ordered phases, including the A-type antiferromagnetic, collinear spin-ordered phase and the ferroelectric bc and ab spiral spin-ordered phases, which are realized by tuning the chemical composition of R, the temperature, and the external magnetic field. In addition to the antiferromagnetic resonances of Mn ions driven by the magnetic field component of light, we clarify that the electromagnon appears only for light that is polarized along the a axis, even in the collinear spin-ordered phase, and it grows in intensity with evolution of the spiral spin order but is independent of the direction of the spiral spin plane (bc or ab) or, equivalently, the direction of the ferroelectric polarization Ps (Ps{$\parallel$}c or Ps{$\parallel$}a). A possible origin of the observed magnetic resonances at terahertz frequencies is discussed by comparing the systematic experimental data presented here with theoretical considerations based on the Heisenberg model.},

Second, we introduce the idea of orbital polarons originating from a strong polarization of orbitals in the vicinity of holes. Considering this direct coupling between charge and orbital degrees of freedom in addition to lattice effects we are able to explain well the phase diagram of manganites for low and intermediate hole concentrations.},

The complex dielectric response along b and c axes of the Pbnm orthorhombic unit cell, \texttildelow{$\epsilon$}b({$\nu$}) and \texttildelow{$\epsilon$}c({$\nu$}), is highly anisotropic over the spectral range covered in the experiment. The difference between \texttildelow{$\epsilon$}b({$\nu$}) and \texttildelow{$\epsilon$}c({$\nu$}) increases with decreasing temperature, and the gradual evolution observed in the paramagnetic state is strongly enhanced by the onset of A-type antiferromagnetic long-range order at TN=139.6 K. In this study we focus on the analysis of excitations observed at high energy ({$\sim$}4\textendash 5 eV) and show that the observed temperature changes of their spectral weight are opposite to those found for the lowest-energy gap excitation at {$\sim$}2 eV. We used a classical dispersion analysis to quantitatively determine the temperature-dependent optical spectral-weights shifts between low- and high-energy optical bands. Based on the observation of a pronounced spectral-weight transfer between both features upon magnetic ordering, they are assigned to high-spin and low-spin intersite d4d4{$\rightleftharpoons$}d3d5 transitions by Mn electrons. The anisotropy of the lowest-energy optical band and the spectral-weight shifts induced by antiferromagnetic spin correlations are quantitatively described by an effective spin-orbital superexchange model. An analysis of the multiplet structure of the intersite transitions by Mn eg electrons allowed us to estimate the effective intra-atomic Coulomb interaction, the Hund exchange coupling, and the Jahn-Teller splitting energy between eg orbitals in LaMnO3, as well as to extract experimental information concerning the type of orbital order in LaMnO3. This study identifies the lowest-energy optical transition at {$\sim$}2 eV as an intersite d-d transition whose energy is substantially reduced compared to that obtained from the bare intra-atomic Coulomb interaction.},

The approach is based on utilization of some hypothesis appropriate to the Preisach picture of the magnetization process for half-metallic ferromagnets and an assumption that in doped manganites a Griffiths-type phase exists just above the magnetic-ordering temperature. Within the model, the system is considered as a random three-dimensional resistor network where a self-consistent formation of paths with metal and polaron types of conductivity is not only due to magnetic field variation but also due to temperature changes, as well. Both mechanisms of intrinsic percolation transition are considered on one basis. The theory is able to replicate the basic regularities found experimentally for doped manganites resistivity dependence on temperature and magnetic field without the need for empirical input from the magnetoresistive data. Within the approach a natural basis has arisen for a qualitative classification of magnetoresistive materials into those, such as La0.7Sr0.3MnO3, showing modest magnetoresistivity, and those, such as La0.7Ca0.3MnO3, showing large magnetoresistivity.},

THz spectroscopy extracts material parameters such as dynamic conductivity, dielectric constant, and magnetic permeability in spectral range of 1\textendash 20 meV.

We present illustrative examples of intrinsic magnetodielectric coupling in non-polar ferro- and antiferromagnets, SeCuO3 and TeCuO3 respectively, and of magnetodielectric coupling in a polar system, specifically Ni3V2O8. We also show an example of how spurious magnetocapacitive effects can significantly modify the magnetodielectric response of a system.

The fast process is designated as the initial melting of orthorhombic phase induced by the Mn-O bond change that is most likely driven by the quenching of the dynamic Jahn-Teller distortion following the photo-excitation. The slow process is attributed to the growing of newly formed structure domain from the photo-excited sites to the neighboring non-excited orthorhombic sites.},

However, Schr\"odinger's equation for this seemingly simple system can be solved exactly only under the rotating-wave approximation, which neglects the counter-rotating field component. When the a.c. field is sufficiently strong, this approximation fails, leading to a resonance-frequency shift known as the Bloch\textendash Siegert shift. Here, we report the vacuum Bloch\textendash Siegert shift, which is induced by the ultra-strong coupling of matter with the counter-rotating component of the vacuum fluctuation field in a cavity. Specifically, an ultra-high-mobility two-dimensional electron gas inside a high-Q terahertz cavity in a quantizing magnetic field revealed ultra-narrow Landau polaritons, which exhibited a vacuum Bloch\textendash Siegert shift up to 40\,GHz. This shift, clearly distinguishable from the photon-field self-interaction effect, represents a unique manifestation of a strong-field phenomenon without a strong field.},

  abstract = {We report results of terahertz Faraday and Kerr rotation spectroscopy measurements on thin films of Bi1-xSbx, an alloy system that exhibits a semimetal-to-topological-insulator transition as the Sb composition x increases. By using a single-shot time-domain terahertz spectroscopy setup combined with a table-top pulsed minicoil magnet, we conducted measurements in magnetic fields up to 30 T, observing distinctly different behaviors between semimetallic (x{$<$}0.07) and topological insulator (x{$>$}0.07) samples. Faraday and Kerr rotation spectra for the semimetallic films showed a pronounced dip that blueshifted with the magnetic field, whereas spectra for the topological insulator films were positive and featureless, increasing in amplitude with increasing magnetic field and eventually saturating at high fields ({$>$}20 T). Ellipticity spectra for the semimetallic films showed resonances, whereas the topological insulator films showed no detectable ellipticity. To explain these observations, we developed a theoretical model based on realistic band parameters and the Kubo formula for calculating the optical conductivity of Landau-quantized charge carriers. Our calculations quantitatively reproduced all experimental features, establishing that the Faraday and Kerr signals in the semimetallic films predominantly arise from bulk hole cyclotron resonances while the signals in the topological insulator films represent combined effects of surface carriers originating from multiple electron and hole pockets. These results demonstrate that the use of high magnetic fields in terahertz magnetopolarimetry, combined with detailed electronic structure and conductivity calculations, allows us to unambiguously identify and quantitatively determine unique contributions from different species of carriers of topological and nontopological nature in Bi1-xSbx.},

The gain has a circular-polarization selection rule: a strong line is observed for hole-cyclotron-resonance-active polarization. Furthermore, the gain appears only when the exciton 1s state is populated, which rules out intraexcitonic transitions to be its origin.

The magnetic force microscope images show the stripe magnetic domains, characteristic of films with the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). The optical reflectance and transmittance of the samples were measured over a broad energy range from the far infrared through the ultraviolet. To extract the optical constants of the films, we analyzed all of the layers of this thin-film structure using a Drude-Lorentz model. From the parameters obtained, we compute the optical constants, such as frequency-dependent optical conductivity and the diagonal components of the dielectric tensor. Moreover, the MO polar Kerr spectra of the samples were measured in an applied magnetic field of 1.5T between 0.74 and 5.8eV. The off-diagonal components of the dielectric tensor were then calculated by analyzing Kerr rotation, ellipticity, and the determined diagonal elements of the dielectric tensor. These functions yield information about the spin-dependent electronic structures of the LSMO thin films. We observed several MO-active transitions above 2eV. These bands arise from the Mn-d(t2g) to Mn-d(eg) in the majority-spin channel and the onset of O-2p to Mn-d(eg) and O-2p to Mn-d(t2g) transitions in the minority-spin channel, in accord with the band-structure calculations. Most interestingly, their peak position and intensity are dependent on the film thickness, suggesting possible applications for tailoring MO responses in these PMA thin films.},

At the Curie temperature (room temperature), the THz conductivity of the VAN was dramatically enhanced by over 2 orders of magnitude under the application of a magnetic field with a non-Drude THz conductivity that increased with frequency. The direct current (dc) CMR of the VAN is controlled by extrinsic magnetotransport mechanisms such as spin-polarized tunneling between nanograins. In contrast, we find that THz CMR is dominated by intrinsic, intragrain transport: the mean free path was smaller than the nanocolumn size, and the planar thin-film exhibited similar THz CMR to the VAN. Surprisingly, the observed colossal THz magnetoresistance suggests that the magnetoresistance can be large for alternating current motion on nanometer length scales, even when the magnetoresistance is negligible on the macroscopic length scales probed by dc transport. This suggests that colossal magnetoresistance at THz frequencies may find use in nanoelectronics and in THz optical components controlled by magnetic fields. The VAN can be scaled in thickness while retaining a high structural quality and offers a larger THz CMR at room temperature than the planar film.},

However, they are still on the way to practical application due to low modulation speed, narrow bandwidth, and insufficient modulation depth. Therefore, we review the research progress of THz modulator in recent years and evaluate devices critically and comprehensively. We focus on the working principles such as electric, optical, optoelectrical, thermal, magnetic, programmable metamaterials and nonlinear modulation methods for THz wave with semiconductors, metamaterials, and 2D materials (such as graphene, molybdenum disulfide, and tungsten disulfide). Furthermore, we propose a guiding rule to select appropriate materials and modulation methods for specific applications in THz communication.},

Their ground states are predicted to be vacuum squeezed states with suppressed quantum fluctuations owing to antiresonant terms in the Hamiltonian. However, such predictions have not been realized because antiresonant interactions are typically negligible compared to resonant interactions in light-matter systems. Here we report an unusual, ultrastrongly coupled matter-matter system of magnons that is analytically described by a unique Hamiltonian in which the relative importance of resonant and antiresonant interactions can be easily tuned and the latter can be made vastly dominant. We found a regime where vacuum Bloch-Siegert shifts, the hallmark of antiresonant interactions, greatly exceed analogous frequency shifts from resonant interactions. Further, we theoretically explored the system's ground state and calculated up to 5.9 dB of quantum fluctuation suppression. These observations demonstrate that magnonic systems provide an ideal platform for exploring exotic quantum vacuum phenomena predicted in ultrastrongly coupled light-matter systems.},

The effect appears in the vicinity of the second-order magnetic phase transition and is caused by long-range Coulomb forces. The long-range Coulomb interaction is responsible for the formation of inhomogeneous charged states and determines their characteristic length scales. We derive the phase diagram of the inhomogeneous charged states in the framework of the phenomenological theory of phase transitions. The large value of the static dielectric function reduces the characteristic value of the Coulomb energy of the inhomogeneous state and makes the appearance of the magnetoelectric effect possible.

Results are presented for investigations demonstrating the robustness of the PLER of random electrical networks in order to evaluate the usefulness of such models in simulating real composite materials with microstructural disorder. The effect of imposed microstructures has been investigated, looking at both the correlation length and the network size. It is shown that the exact microstructural details may be reasonably omitted, so long as we take care that the general features of the structures, such as their relative smallest and largest scales, are represented. Anisotropy in the random microstructures is shown to alter the bulk response of the system, with the network responses found to tend towards that expected for purely parallel and series components. The power-law response is shown to be obtainable by taking the geometric mean of the two cases, showing that the bulk response of such systems is an averaged property of these two extreme cases. It is concluded that, given the longer computing times needed to simulate these more realistic representations, it is reasonable to use the simpler models.},

Our Hamiltonian includes double-exchange, superexchange, and Hubbard terms with on-site and nearest-neighbour Coulomb interaction, with the parameters estimated from earlier density-functional calculations. The phase diagrams show magnetic and charge-ordered (or charge-disordered) phases as a result of the competition between the double-exchange, superexchange, and Hubbard terms, the relative effects of which are sensitively dependent on parameters such as doping, bandwidth, and temperature. In accord with the experimental observations, several important features are reproduced from our model, namely, (i) a phase transition from an insulating, charge-ordered antiferromagnetic to a metallic, charge-disordered ferromagnetic state near dopant concentration x = 1/2, (ii) the reduction of the transition temperature TAF F by the application of a magnetic field, (iii) melting of the charge order by a magnetic field, and (iv) phase coexistence for certain values of temperature and doping. An important feature, not reproduced in our model, is the antiferromagnetism in the electron-doped systems, e.g., La1-xCaxMnO3 over the entire range of 0.5 x1, and we suggest that a multi-band model which includes the unoccupied t2g orbitals might be an important ingredient for describing this feature.},

Although the quasi-one-dimensional ferromagnet CoNb2O6 has been regarded as the Ising chain's best material realization, it exhibits substantial deviations from ideality. By combining terahertz spectroscopy and calculations, we show that CoNb2O6 is in fact described by a different model with bond-dependent interactions, which we call the `twisted Kitaev chain', as these interactions are similar to those of the honeycomb Kitaev spin liquid. The ferromagnetic ground state of CoNb2O6 arises from the compromise between two axes. Owing to this frustration, even at zero field domain walls have quantum motion, which is described by the celebrated Su\textendash Schriefer\textendash Heeger model of polyacetylene and shows rich behaviour as a function of field. Nevertheless, close to the critical field, this model enters a universal regime in the Ising universality class. We observe that the excitation gap in the ferromagnet closes at a rate twice that of the paramagnet. This universal ratio originates in the Kramers\textendash Wannier duality between domain walls and spin flips, and in the topological conservation of domain wall parity. Our work also shows that Co2+ magnets are fertile ground in the search for quantum spin liquids.},

We have measured the dispersion of the spin waves propagating in the highest symmetry directions solving the problems related to twinning. The whole spin wave spectrum is well accounted for with a Heisenberg Hamiltonian and a single ion anisotropy term responsible for the easy magnetization direction (b axis). This term induces a gap of 2.7 meV at low temperature in the spin wave dispersion curve. An important result is that the ferromagnetic exchange integral (J1{$\approx$}0.83 meV), coupling the spins within the ferromagnetic basal plane (a,b), is larger by a factor 1.4 than the antiferromagnetic exchange integral (J2{$\approx-$}0.58 meV) coupling spins belonging to adjacent MnO2 planes along c.},

  abstract = {Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) is a powerful technique for material's characterization and process control. It has been used for contact-free conductivity measurements of metals, semiconductors, 2D materials, and superconductors. Furthermore, THz-TDS has been used to identify chemical components such as amino acids, peptides, pharmaceuticals, and explosives, which makes it particularly valuable for fundamental science, security, and medical applications. This tutorial is intended for a reader completely new to the field of THz-TDS and presents a basic understanding of THz-TDS. Hundreds of articles and many books can be consulted after reading this tutorial. We explore the basic concepts of TDS and discuss the relationship between temporal and frequency domain information. We illustrate how THz radiation can be generated and detected, and we discuss common noise sources and limitations for THz-TDS. This tutorial concludes by discussing some common experimental scenarios and explains how THz-TDS measurements can be used to identify materials, determine complex refractive indices (phase delay and absorption), and extract conductivity.},

After imaging the gate beam onto a camera, we can retrieve the terahertz time-domain waveform by analyzing the resulting image.

The effective moments {$\mu$}eff obtained from fits to the Curie-Weiss law in the paramagnetic regime are strongly enhanced from their theoretical values, both above and below the pseudocubic orthorhombic (O-O{${'}$}) Jahn-Teller (JT) transition. This indicates the presence of clusters and that this clustering is not induced or affected by the JT transition. The {$\mu$}eff values in the O and O{${'}$} phases are very similar, however, their paramagnetic Curie temperatures are rather different, implying that the JT distortion only induces a change in the exchange-coupling parameters but not in the character of the clusters. The correlation between the high-temperature paramagnetic and low-temperature ferromagnetic parameters suggests that the O and O'' phases are not only analogous structurally but have also comparable exchange-coupling parameters and are consequently similar magnetically. Finally, the competition between the JT distortion, the magnetic field, and the molecular field, among other factors, apparently governs the properties of these systems.},

The magnetization shows a sharp jump at the transition field accompanied by a remarkable increase of magnetoresistance. Striction measurements clarified that this transition is associated with the structural change from a Jahn-Teller (JT) distorted orthorhombic phase to a pseudocubic phase. These results evidently show that the FI phase with a pseudocubic symmetry is more stable in high fields than the FM phase due to the double-exchange interaction. The driving force of this transition is explained by the enhancement of the ferromagnetic superexchange interaction induced by an antiferromagnetic-type orbital ordering in the pseudocubic phase, which was recently found in the anomalous x-ray scattering experiments.},

Thus, the electronic density of states is completely spin polarized at the Fermi level, and the conductivity is dominated by these metallic single-spin charge carriers. This exotic physical property could have a significant effect on technological applications related to magnetism and spin electronics. Some ferromagnetic systems, such as Heusler compounds1 and chromium dioxide2, have been predicted theoretically to be half-metallic. However, a half-metallic system has not been demonstrated directly and the predictions are still in doubt3,4. Here we report spin-resolved photoemission measurements of a ferromagnetic manganese perovskite, La0.7Sr0.3MnO3, which directly manifest the half-metallic nature well below the Curie temperature.

As a result, we do not know what are the weakly interacting degrees of freedom which pair up to form the superconducting condensate. That the electrons are not the propagating degrees of freedom in the cuprates is seen most directly from experiments that show spectral weight redistributions over all energy scales. Of course, the actual propagating degrees of freedom minimize such spectral rearrangements. This review focuses on the range of epxerimental consequences such UV-IR mixings have on the normal state of the cuprates, such as the pseudogap, mid-infrared band, temperature dependence of the Hall number, the superfluid density, and a recent theoretical advance which permits the identification of the weakly interacting degrees of freedom in a doped Mott insulator. Within this theory, we show how the wide range of phenomena which typify the normal state of the cuprates arises including \$T-\$linear resistivity.},

According to our study, the DC electrical conductivity can be described by the virtual free electron gas model, and high frequency conductivity can be described by the combination of the Drude model for disordered materials and Jonscher's universal power law. The observed peak at the imaginary part of AC conductivity was related to the scattering time of the electron-phonon coupling.

First I describe some results of large U, JH calculations in single-site DMFT (dynamical mean field theory) which includes the effect of all the strong local correlations.

The prototypical CMR compound is derived from the parent compound, perovskite . When hole doped at a concentration of 20 - 40\% holes/Mn ion, for instance by Ca or Sr substitution for La, the material displays a transition from a high-temperature paramagnetic insulator to a low-temperature ferromagnetic metal. Near the phase transition temperature, which can exceed room temperature in some compositions, large magnetoresistance is observed and its possible application in magnetic recording has revived interest in these materials. In addition, unusual magneto-elastic effects and charge ordering have focused attention on strong electron - phonon coupling. This coupling, which is a type of dynamic extended-system version of the Jahn - Teller effect, in conjunction with the double-exchange interaction, is also viewed as essential for a microscopic description of CMR in the manganite perovskites. Large magnetoresistance is also seen in other systems, namely and some Cr chalcogenide spinels, compounds which differ greatly from the manganite perovskites. We describe the relevant points of contrast between the various CMR materials.},

In LCMO and LSMO, an unusually slow ({$\sim$}1 {$\mu$}s) carrier relaxation component is revealed in the transient reflectivity traces. The component disappears as the transition temperature is approached from below. This slow decay process is attributed to spin-lattice relaxation of carriers in localized states and shows a close relationship with the spectral weight near the Fermi surface. The attribution is further supported by our pump-probe magneto-optical Kerr measurements. In addition to the clear observation of magnetic precessions, a long-lived exponentially decaying background reflects the spin-related relaxation of photoexcited electrons. In contrast to manganites, the temperature dependence of transient reflectivity is negligible, although there is a significant change in transient Kerr rotation in SFMO. Our results show that the dynamics of charge, spin, and lattice are strongly correlated with each other in the manganites, but the spin degree of freedom is thermally insulated from the electron and lattice systems.},

Spectra of the Mn 2p core levels and the valence bands for LaMnO3 and SrMnO3 have been analyzed using a configuration-interaction cluster model. The ground state of LaMnO3 is found to be mixed d4 and d5L states and that of SrMnO3 to be heavily mixed d3 and d4L states, reflecting their strong covalency. The character of the band gap of LaMnO3 is of the p-to-d charge-transfer type while that of SrMnO3 has considerable p-p character as well as p-d character. Holes doped into LaMnO3 mainly of oxygen p character are coupled antiferromagnetically with the d4 local moments of the Mn3+ ions and become itinerant, thus aligning the Mn moments ferromagnetically. The changes in the electronic structure with carrier doping are not of the rigid band type: By La substitution for SrMnO3, the so-called in-gap spectral weight (of eg{$\uparrow$} symmetry) appears with its peak located 1\textendash 2 eV below the Fermi level and grows in intensity with increasing La concentration, while the spectral intensity of the eg{$\uparrow$} states above the Fermi level decreases, showing a transfer of spectral weight from the unoccupied to the occupied eg{$\uparrow$} states with electron doping. Meanwhile, the intensity at the Fermi level remains low even in the metallic phase (0.2{$\lessequivlnt$}x{$\lessequivlnt$}0.6). The energy shifts of core-level peaks and valence-band features with x suggest a downward shift of the Fermi level with hole doping, but the shift is found to be very small in the metallic phase. The importance of the orbital degeneracy of the eg{$\uparrow$} band and possible orbital fluctuations in the ferromagnetic phase are pointed out.},

  abstract = {Magnetocapacitance (MC) effect has been observed in systems where both symmetries of time-reversal and space-inversion are broken, for examples, in multiferroic materials and spintronic devices. The effect has received increasing attention due to its interesting physics and the prospect of applications. Recently, a large tunnel magnetocapacitance (TMC) of 332\% at room temperature was reported using MgO-based (001)-textured magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). Here, we report further enhancement in TMC beyond 420\% at room temperature using epitaxial MTJs with an MgAl2O4(001) barrier with a cation-disordered spinel structure. This large TMC is partially caused by the high effective tunneling spin polarization, resulted from the excellent lattice matching between the Fe electrodes and the MgAl2O4 barrier. The epitaxial nature of this MTJ system sports an enhanced spin-dependent coherent tunneling effect. Among other factors leading to the large TMC are the appearance of the spin capacitance, the large barrier height, and the suppression of spin flipping through the MgAl2O4 barrier. We explain the observed TMC by the Debye-Fr\"ohlich modelled calculation incorporating Zhang-sigmoid formula, parabolic barrier approximation, and spin-dependent drift diffusion model. Furthermore, we predict a 1000\% TMC in MTJs with a spin polarization of 0.8. These experimental and theoretical findings provide a deeper understanding on the intrinsic mechanism of the TMC effect. New applications based on large TMC may become possible in spintronics, such as multi-value memories, spin logic devices, magnetic sensors, and neuromorphic computing.},

From the frequency dependence of the complex conductivity we find hopping of Anderson-localized charge carriers as the dominant transport process in certain temperature and composition ranges. We deduce that, while Anderson localization is not the driving mechanism for the metal-insulator transition observed in this compound, it is responsible for the high-resistivity regions observed at low doping levels and low temperatures. The results indicate a polaronic nature of the charge carriers. From the temperature dependence of the ac conductivity and the magnetic permeability, deduced in the skin-effect-dominated regime, various phase transition temperatures have been determined.},

It is required to shield electromagnetic sources against the effect of back-reflected light, as well as to limit the detrimental effect of back-propagating spontaneous emissions. A common isolator variant, the circulator, is widely used to obtain a complete separation between forward- and backward-propagating waves, thus enabling the realization of a desired transfer function in reflection only. Here we demonstrate a non-reciprocal terahertz Faraday isolator, operating on a bandwidth exceeding one decade of frequency, a necessary requirement to achieve isolation with the (few-cycle) pulses generated by broadband sources. The exploited medium allows a broadband rotation, up to 194\textdegree/T, obtained using a SrFe12O19 terahertz-transparent permanent magnet. This in turn enables the design of a stand-alone complete terahertz isolator without resorting to an external magnetic field bias, as opposed to all the optical isolators realized so far.},

In the low-temperature orbital-ordered phase, these bending modes become sharper and the temperature dependence of the oscillator strength coincides with that of the orbital ordering order-parameter directly determined by resonant X-ray scattering. These facts indicate a strong correlation between the bending-type lattice distortion and the orbital ordering in the low temperature phase. For x=0.10, the phonon spectrum shows similarity with that of the end material LaMnO3 and no clear temperature dependence is found.

The exponent {$\beta$} estimated for the LCM system is less than that predicted by Heisenberg model and resides within the zone predicted by Ising model while for the LSM sample, {$\beta$} is higher than that predicted from the Heisenberg model which is considered to be due to the presence of dipole-dipole interaction arising from the large spin moment in the LSM system. The magnetization data of the PCM system cannot be fitted to the modified Arrot plots, which suggest highly inhomogeneous ground state even under 5T magnetic field. Both LSM and LCM have almost equal values of {$\gamma$}. Seebeck coefficient data indicate a crossover from higher-temperature n-type to lower-temperature p-type conductivity behavior in both LSM and LCM systems, while the semiconducting PCM system shows p-type conductivity throughout the temperature range (300\textendash 80K).

  abstract = {Optically probing materials in high magnetic fields can provide enlightening insight into field-modified electronic states and phases, while optically driving materials in high magnetic fields can induce novel nonequilibrium many-body dynamics of spin and charge carriers. While there are high-field magnets compatible with standard optical spectroscopy methods, they are generally bulky and have limited optical access, which prohibit performing state-of-the-art ultrafast and/or nonlinear optical experiments. The Rice Advanced Magnet with Broadband Optics (RAMBO), a unique 30-T pulsed mini-coil magnet system with direct optical access, has enabled previously challenging experiments using femtosecond optical pulses, including time-domain terahertz spectroscopy, in cutting-edge materials placed in strong magnetic fields. Here, we review recent experimental advances made possible by the first-generation RAMBO setup. After summarizing technological aspects of combining optical spectroscopic techniques with the mini-coil magnet, we describe results of magneto-optical studies of a wide variety of materials, providing new insight into the states and dynamics of four types of quasiparticles in solids \textemdash{} excitons, plasmons, magnons, and phonons \textemdash{} in high magnetic fields.},

  abstract = {Terahertz (THz) spectroscopy is a powerful tool for unambiguously extracting complex-valued material properties (e.g., refractive index, conductivity, etc.) from a wide range of samples, with applications ranging from materials science to biology. However, extracting complex refractive indices from THz time-domain spectroscopy data can prove challenging, especially for multilayer samples. These challenges arise from the large number of transmission-reflection paths the THz pulse can take through the sample layers, leading to unwieldy strings of Fresnel coefficients. This issue has often been addressed using various approximations. However, these approximations are only applicable to specific classes of samples and can give erroneous results when misapplied. An alternative to this approach is to programmatically model all possible paths through the sample. The many paths through the sample layers can be modeled as a tree that branches at every point where the paths diverge, i.e., whenever the pulse can either be transmitted or reflected. This tree can then be used to generate expressions relating the unknown refractive index to the observed time domain data. Here, we provide a freely available open-source package implementing this method as both a MATLAB library and a corresponding graphical user interface, which can also be run without a MATLAB license (https://github.com/YaleTHz/nelly). We have tested this method for a range of samples and compared the results to commonly used approximations to demonstrate its accuracy and wide applicability. Our method consistently gives better agreement than common approximations.},

But it remains unclear why the magnetoresistive response increases dramatically when the Curie temperature (T C) is reduced. In these materials, T C varies sensitively with changing chemical pressure; this can be achieved by introducing trivalent rare-earth ions of differing size into the perovskite structure2,3,4, without affecting the valency of the Mn ions. The chemical pressure modifies local structural parameters such as the Mn\textendash O bond distance and Mn\textendash O\textendash Mn bond angle, which directly influence the case of electron hopping between Mn ions (that is, the electronic bandwidth). But these effects cannot satisfactorily explain the dependence of magnetoresistance on T C. Here we demonstrate, using electron microscopy data, that the prototypical (La,Pr,Ca)MnO3 system is electronically phase-separated into a sub-micrometre-scale mixture of insulating regions (with a particular type of charge-ordering) and metallic, ferromagnetic domains. We find that the colossal magnetoresistive effect in low-T C systems can be explained by percolative transport through the ferromagnetic domains; this depends sensitively on the relative spin orientation of adjacent ferromagnetic domains which can be controlled by applied magnetic fields.},

This allows us to study not only the influence of the spin configuration on the magnetotransport properties [colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) effect] but also the role of orbital order and disorder. The orbital ordering transition (at 269 K in zero magnetic field) causes a doubling of the resistivity (regardless of the CMR effect in applied magnetic fields) and a drop of the paramagnetic susceptibility. The latter might be interpreted in terms of a shrinking of spin polarons. External magnetic fields shift the ordering transition to lower temperatures according to the field-induced decrease of the carrier localization. The magnetic-field\textendash temperature phase boundary line was investigated by means of magnetoresistance (up to 12 T) and pulsed-fields magnetization measurements up to 50 T. The pronounced magnetization anomalies, associated with the phase transition, vanish for fields exceeding 20 T. This behavior has been attributed to a field-induced crossover from antiferrodistorsive order to a nondistorsive/ferromagnetic orbital configuration.},

By using the THz time domain spectroscopy, these three LCs have been investigated under different low magnetic fields. Experimental results show that the randomly aligned LCs in 3mm thickness cells still have high birefringence controlled by a low magnetic field in the THz regime. The phase shift of \&\#x03C0; for BNHR cell is achieved over the entire testing range at 30mT, and the dynamic response process of BNHR under a weak magnetic field has also been investigated. When the initial magnetic field of 5mT is applied, unlike the continuous tunability of the cells filled with 5CB and E7, the BNHR cell has a great phase shift of 1.5\&\#x03C0; at 0.35THz before reaching the steady state. During that process the refractive index and absorption of BNHR vary with time due to its high viscosity, and a larger magnetic field can significantly shorten the response time. These indicate that the randomly aligned mm-thick LC layer of THz devices can be used as a tunable THz wave retarder with low a driving magnetic field and high phase modulation depth in a broad THz band. Therefore, a simple manufacturing technique and low magnetic control of these randomly aligned LC layers may explore some novel LC based THz devices for spatial light modulation, filtering and tuning tasks.},

Various functional devices have been developed, such as filters, absorbers, polarizers, mixers, and modulators. Among these, the terahertz phase modulation is a current research hotspot. It is the core technology to realize flexible control of the terahertz wavefront, beam scanning, focusing deflection. It is indispensable in terahertz wireless communication, high-resolution imaging, and radar systems. This review summarizes the research progress of terahertz phase modulators from the two major types: free space and guided wave integration. Among these, the free space terahertz phase modulator is realized by combining the tunable materials and artificial metasurfaces. Based on different types of tunable materials, the~terahertz free space phase modulator combining the semiconductor, liquid crystal, phase change materials, graphene, and other two-dimensional materials are introduced, and the influence of different materials on the phase modulation performance is discussed and~analyzed. The monolithic integration and waveguide embedding methods are introduced separately, and the characteristics of different forms of terahertz-guided wave phase modulation are also discussed. Finally, the development trends of terahertz phase modulators, possible new methods, and future application requirements are discussed.},

  abstract = {We have performed time-resolved terahertz absorption measurements on photoexcited electron-hole pairs in undoped GaAs quantum wells in magnetic fields. We probed both unbound- and bound-carrier responses via cyclotron resonance and intraexciton resonance, respectively. The stability of excitons, monitored as the pair density was systematically increased, was found to dramatically increase with increasing magnetic field. Specifically, the 1s-2p- intraexciton transition at 9 T persisted up to the highest density, whereas the 1s-2p feature at 0 T was quickly replaced by a free-carrier Drude response. Interestingly, at 9 T, the 1s-2p- peak was replaced by free-hole cyclotron resonance at high temperatures, indicating that 2D magnetoexcitons do dissociate under thermal excitation, even though they are stable against a density-driven Mott transition.},

  abstract = {Realizing active quantum control of materials near room temperature is one of the ultimate aims for their practical applications. Recent technological breakthroughs demonstrated that optical stimulation may lead to thermally inaccessible hidden states with unique properties. However, most of the reported hidden states were induced around or below liquid nitrogen temperature. Here, we optically manipulated a manganite near its Curie temperature of 300\,K, where typically complex phase competitions locate as well as opportunities for new functionality. A room temperature hidden state was formed with threshold behavior evidenced by a femtosecond paramagnetic to ferromagnetic order switching and a structural change distinct from thermal induced lattice expansion in tens of picoseconds accompanying with phonon softening. We propose that such a hidden state originates from the charge transfer between antiferromagnetic chains after strongly correlated spin-charge quantum excitation, which subsequently initiates an orbital polarization rearrangement described as \$\$\{\textbackslash mathrm\{Mn\}\}\_\{3x\^2 - \{r\}\^2/3y\^2 - \{r\}\^2\}\^\{3 + \}\{\textbackslash mathrm\{Mn\}\}\^\{4 + \} \textbackslash to \{\textbackslash mathrm\{Mn\}\}\^\{4 + \}\{\textbackslash mathrm\{Mn\}\}\_\{3z\^2 - \{r\}\^2\}\^\{3 + \}\$\$and associated non-thermal lattice change. This study started from room temperature yet near a phase transition point, which suggests a new route to create or manipulate novel phases for practical purpose.},

The bulk sample has an orthorhombic structure and a ferromagnetic insulating ground state. The ESR spectra indicate the coexistence of the ferromagnetic insulating and ferromagnetic metallic phases below TC. In addition to a sharp peak in the vicinity of TC, another sharp peak close to TOO is clearly observed in the intensity of the spectra, which may be correlated with the structural transition and orbital ordering at this temperature. For the nanosized sample, a drastically different behavior is found. With a rhombohedral structure down to 70~K, the nanosized sample shows a ferromagnetic metallic ground state. The ESR studies reveal the coexistence of the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic resonance signals. The resonance intensity shows a broad peak around 200~K, which may be due to the wide ferromagnetic transition in the nanoparticle.},

The transfer and disappearance of the PC-based mode can be realized by utilizing a waveguide and a plasma cavity.

  abstract = {In order to elucidate the origin of the ferromagnetism found in underdoped La1-xSrxMnO3, we have grown a series of single crystals with a fine step of doping and characterized them with a structural study and measurements of magnetization, resistivity, thermoelectric power, and thermal conductivity. The paramagnetic phase of the underdoped La1-xSrxMnO3 is a small-polaron conductor. However, the Weiss constant extracted from the paramagnetic susceptibility shows a ferromagnetic coupling and tracks the Curie temperature. Given that the double exchange interaction cannot be delivered by the hopping motion of small polarons, we have made a systematic analysis of the structural changes with x and studied whether the superexchange interaction can account for the ferromagnetic coupling found in the paramagnetic phase. Intrinsic local site distortions in LaMnO3 change as x increases in La1-xSrxMnO3. The influence of the local structural distortion and the cooperative orbital ordering on lattice parameters have been demonstrated by a comparison between the measured change of lattice parameters versus hole doping and a simulation with the software SPuDs, in which rigid octahedra are assumed. Changes with x of the bond length splitting in MnO6 octahedra induces an orbital mixing of (3x2-r2)+(y2-z2)or(3y2-r2)+(z2-x2), which progressively converts two-dimensional ferromagnetism in the parent perovskite LaMnO3 into three-dimensional ferromagnetism. The correlation between the particular lattice distortions and the cooperative orbital ordering and orbital mixing can in turn be used to test the superexchange model by measuring the change of transition temperatures under uniaxial stress. Nearly identical uniaxial stress effects found in crystals of the mixed-valent La0.875Sr.125MnO3 and single-valent LaMn0.5Ga0.5O3 confirm unambiguously that superexchange interactions play the dominant role in the ferromagnetic coupling of underdoped La1-xSrxMnO3.},

  abstract = {There are a variety of elementary and collective terahertz-frequency excitations in condensed matter whose magnetic field dependence contains significant insight into the states and dynamics of the electrons involved. Often, determining the frequency, temperature, and magnetic field dependence of the optical conductivity tensor, especially in high magnetic fields, can clarify the microscopic physics behind complex many-body behaviors of solids. While there are advanced terahertz spectroscopy techniques as well as high magnetic field generation techniques available, a combination of the two has only been realized relatively recently. Here, we review the current state of terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) experiments in high magnetic fields. We start with an overview of time-domain terahertz detection schemes with a special focus on how they have been incorporated into optically accessible high-field magnets. Advantages and disadvantages of different types of magnets in performing THz-TDS experiments are also discussed. Finally, we highlight some of the new fascinating physical phenomena that have been revealed by THz-TDS in high magnetic fields.},

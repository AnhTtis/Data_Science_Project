abstract = {We describe the LDA band structre of YBa2Cu3O7 in the ϵF ± 2 eV range using orbital projections and compare with YBa2Cu4O8. Then, the high-energy and chain-related degrees of freedom are integrated out and we arrive at two, nearest-neighbor, orthogonal, two-center, 8-band Hamiltonians, H8+ and H8−, for respectively the even and odd bands of the bi-layer. Of the 8 orbitals, Cux2 −y2, O2x, O3y, and Cus have σ character and Cuxz, Cuyz, O2z, and O3z have π character. The roles of the Cus orbital, which has some Cu3z2 − 1 character, and the four π orbitals are as follows: Cus provides 2nd- and 3rd-nearest-neighbor (t′ and t″) intra-plane hopping, as well as hopping between planes (t⊥). The π-orbitals are responsible for bifurcation of the saddle-points for dimpled planes. The 4-σ-band Hamiltonian is generic for flat CuO2 planes and we use it for analytical studies. The k∥-dependence is expressed as one on u ≡ (cos bky + cos akx)2 and one on v ≡ (cos bky − cos akx)2. The latter arises solely through the influence of Cus. The reduction of the σ-Hamiltonian to 3- and 1-band Hamiltonians is explicitly discussed and we point out that, in addition to the hoppings commonly included in many-body calculations, the 3-band Hamiltonian should include hopping between all 2nd-nearest-neighbor oxygens and that the 1-band Hamiltonian should include 3rd-nearest-neighbor hoppings. We calculate the single-particle hopping between the planes of a bi-layer and show that it is generically: t⊥ (k∥) ≈ 0.25 eV · v2 (1 − 2ut′t)−2. The hopping through insulating spacers such as (BaO)Hg(BaO) is an order of magnitude smaller, but seems to have the same k∥-dependence. We show that the inclusion of t′ is crucial for understanding ARPES for the anti-ferromagnetic insulator Sr2CuO2Cl2. Finally, we estimate the value of the inter-plane exchange constant J⊥ for an un-doped bi-layer in meanfield theory using different single-particle Hamiltonians, the LDA for YBa2Cu3O6, the eight- and four-band Hamiltonians, as well as an analytical calculation for the latter. We conclude that J⊥ ~ − 20 meV.}

abstract = {The oxide superconductors, particularly those recently discovered that are based on La2CuO4, have a set of peculiarities that suggest a common, unique mechanism: they tend in every case to occur near a metal-insulator transition into an odd-electron insulator with peculiar magnetic properties. This insulating phase is proposed to be the long-sought "resonating-valence-bond" state or "quantum spin liquid" hypothesized in 1973. This insulating magnetic phase is favored by low spin, low dimensionality, and magnetic frustration. The preexisting magnetic singlet pairs of the insulating state become charged superconducting pairs when the insulator is doped sufficiently strongly. The mechanism for superconductivity is hence predominantly electronic and magnetic, although weak phonon interactions may favor the state. Many unusual properties are predicted, especially of the insulating state.}}

To investigate this situation a simple, approximate model for the interaction of electrons in narrow energy bands is introduced. The results of applying the Hartree-Fock approximation to this model are examined. Using a Green function technique an approximate solution of the correlation problem for this model is obtained. This solution has the property of reducing to the exact atomic solution in the appropriate limit and to the ordinary uncorrelated band picture in the opposite limit. The condition for ferromagnetism of this solution is discussed. To clarify the physical meaning of the solution a two-electron example is examined.

Despite its simplicity, the model exhibits an incredible wealth of phases, phase transitions, and exotic correlation phenomena. Although analytical methods have provided a qualitative description of the model in certain limits, numerical tools have shown impressive progress in achieving quantitative accurate results over the past several years. This article gives an introduction to the model, motivates common questions, and illustrates the progress that has been achieved over recent years in revealing various aspects of the correlation physics of the model.

    abstract = { The repulsive Hubbard model has been immensely useful in understanding strongly correlated electron systems and serves as the paradigmatic model of the field. Despite its simplicity, it exhibits a strikingly rich phenomenology reminiscent of that observed in quantum materials. Nevertheless, much of its phase diagram remains controversial. Here, we review a subset of what is known about the Hubbard model based on exact results or controlled approximate solutions in various limits, for which there is a suitable small parameter. Our primary focus is on the ground state properties of the system on various lattices in two spatial dimensions, although both lower and higher dimensions are discussed as well. Finally, we highlight some of the important outstanding open questions. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Condensed Matter Physics, Volume 13 is March 2022.

abstract = {Experiments have shown that the families of cuprate superconductors that have the largest transition temperature at optimal doping also have the largest oxygen hole content at that doping [D. Rybicki et al., Nat. Commun. 7, 1–6 (2016)]. They have also shown that a large charge-transfer gap [W. Ruan et al., Sci. Bull. (Beijing) 61, 1826–1832 (2016)], a quantity accessible in the normal state, is detrimental to superconductivity. We solve the three-band Hubbard model with cellular dynamical mean-field theory and show that both of these observations follow from the model. Cuprates play a special role among doped charge-transfer insulators of transition metal oxides because copper has the largest covalent bonding with oxygen. Experiments [L. Wang et al., arXiv [Preprint] (2020). https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.05029 (Accessed 10 November 2020)] also suggest that superexchange is at the origin of superconductivity in cuprates. Our results reveal the consistency of these experiments with the above two experimental findings. Indeed, we show that covalency and a charge-transfer gap lead to an effective short-range superexchange interaction between copper spins that ultimately explains pairing and superconductivity in the three-band Hubbard model of cuprates.}}

such as (BEDT-TTF)2X, (BETS)2Y,
and β′-[Pd(dmit)2]2Z. We begin by defining minimal models for these materials. It is necessary to
identify two classes of material: the first class is strongly dimerized and is described
by a half-filled Hubbard model; the second class is not strongly dimerized and
is described by a quarter-filled extended Hubbard model. We argue that these
models capture the essential physics of these materials. We explore the phase
diagram of the half-filled quasi-two-dimensional organic charge transfer salts,
focusing on the metallic and superconducting phases. We review work showing
that the metallic phase, which has both Fermi liquid and ‘bad metal’ regimes, is
described both quantitatively and qualitatively by dynamical mean field theory
(DMFT). The phenomenology of the superconducting state is still a matter of
contention. We critically review the experimental situation, focusing on the key
experimental results that may distinguish between rival theories of superconductivity,
particularly probes of the pairing symmetry and measurements of the superfluid
stiffness. We then discuss some strongly correlated theories of superconductivity, in
particular the resonating valence bond (RVB) theory of superconductivity. We
conclude by discussing some of the major challenges currently facing the field.
These include parameterizing minimal models, the evidence for a pseudogap from
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments, superconductors with low critical
temperatures and extremely small superfluid stiffnesses, the possible spin-liquid states in
$\kappa$-(ET)2Cu2(CN)3
and β′-[Pd(dmit)2]2Z, and the need for high quality large single crystals.}

Molecular materials are playgrounds suitable for this study. Fundamentals in physics of Mott transition and spin frustration on triangular lattices are seen in the organic materials ET and Pd(dmit)2 compounds. We review the experimental studies on the criticality of Mott transition with a continuously controllable pressure technique and on the ground state of the quasi-triangular-lattice Mott insulator. Mott criticality is well characterized in both charge and spin channels with unconventional critical exponents of possibly quantum nature. The ground state of the triangular-lattice Mott insulator is changed from antiferromagnet to spin liquid as the triangular lattice becomes more isotropic. The various experiments probing the nature of spin liquid are described in the light of proposed mechanisms. }

abstract = {Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures are an emergent class of metamaterials comprised of vertically stacked two-dimensional (2D) building blocks, which provide us with a vast tool set to engineer their properties on top of the already rich tunability of 2D materials. One of the knobs, the twist angle between different layers, plays a crucial role in the ultimate electronic properties of a vdW heterostructure and does not have a direct analog in other systems such as MBE-grown semiconductor heterostructures. For small twist angles, the moir$\backslash$'e pattern produced by the lattice misorientation creates a long-range modulation. So far, the study of the effect of twist angles in vdW heterostructures has been mostly concentrated in graphene/hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) twisted structures, which exhibit relatively weak interlayer interaction due to the presence of a large bandgap in h-BN. Here we show that when two graphene sheets are twisted by an angle close to the theoretically predicted 'magic angle', the resulting flat band structure near charge neutrality gives rise to a strongly-correlated electronic system. These flat bands exhibit half-filling insulating phases at zero magnetic field, which we show to be a Mott-like insulator arising from electrons localized in the moir$\backslash$'e superlattice. These unique properties of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TwBLG) open up a new playground for exotic many-body quantum phases in a 2D platform made of pure carbon and without magnetic field. The easy accessibility of the flat bands, the electrical tunability, and the bandwidth tunability though twist angle may pave the way towards more exotic correlated systems, such as unconventional superconductors or quantum spin liquids.},

abstract = {In 1957, John Bardeen, Leon Cooper, and John Robert Schrieffer came up with the first theory of superconductivity to describe how some materials can conduct electricity with no electrical resistance. However, there are many superconductive materials that cannot be described using this theory. Understanding the mechanism of unconventional superconductivity could help scientists engineer materials with higher transition temperatures. Pablo Jarillo-Herrero and colleagues now show that when two graphene sheets are twisted by a certain angle they exhibit unconventional superconductivity, with features similar to high-temperature superconducting cuprates. This system can easily be tuned through both the twist angle and electric fields, so could provide a new two-dimensional platform for understanding the origin of high-temperature superconductivity. Elsewhere in this issue, the same team reports that twisting graphene sheets in this manner also creates an insulating state that appears to be driven by strong electronic interactions, consistent with a Mott-like insulator phase.},

abstract = {With the discovery of charge-density waves (CDWs) in most members of the cuprate high-temperature superconductors, the interplay between superconductivity and CDWs has become a key point in the debate on the origin of high-temperature superconductivity. Some experiments in cuprates point toward a CDW state competing with superconductivity, but others raise the possibility of a CDW-superconductivity intertwined order or more elusive pair-density waves (PDWs). Here, we have used proton irradiation to induce disorder in crystals of La1.875Ba0.125CuO4 and observed a striking 50\% increase of Tc, accompanied by a suppression of the CDWs. This is in sharp contrast with the behavior expected of a d-wave superconductor, for which both magnetic and nonmagnetic defects should suppress Tc. Our results thus make an unambiguous case for the strong detrimental effect of the CDW on bulk superconductivity in La1.875Ba0.125CuO4. Using tunnel diode oscillator (TDO) measurements, we find indications for potential dynamic layer decoupling in a PDW phase. Our results establish irradiation-induced disorder as a particularly relevant tuning parameter for the many families of superconductors with coexisting density waves, which we demonstrate on superconductors such as the dichalcogenides and Lu5Ir4Si10.}}

	abstract = {In this work we determine the one-body Greenʼs function as solution of a set of functional integro-differential equations, which relate the one-particle Greenʼs function to its functional derivative with respect to an external potential. In the same spirit as Lani et al (2012 New J. Phys. 14 013056), we do this in a one-point model, where the equations become ordinary differential equations (DEs) and, hence, solvable with standard techniques. This allows us to analyze several aspects of these DEs as well as of standard methods for determining the one-body Greenʼs function that are important for real systems. In particular: (i) we present a strategy to determine the physical solution among the many mathematical solutions; (ii) we assess the accuracy of an approximate DE related to the +cumulant method by comparing it to the exact physical solution and to standard approximations such as ; (iii) we show that the solution of the approximate DE can be improved by combining it with a screened interaction in the random-phase approximation. (iv) We demonstrate that by iterating the  Dyson equation one does not always converge to a  solution and we discuss which iterative scheme is the most suitable to avoid such errors.}

Sampling Feynman's diagrammatic series for the single-particle self-energy, we can study moderate values of the on-site repulsion (U/t∼4) and temperatures down to T/t=1/40. We compare our results with high-temperature series expansions and with single-site and cluster dynamical mean-field theory.}

abstract = {Recently, diagrammatic extensions of dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) have been proposed for including short- and long-range correlations beyond DMFT on an equal footing. We employ one of these, the dynamical vertex approximation (DΓA), and study the two-dimensional Hubbard model on a square lattice. We define two transition lines in the phase diagram which correspond, respectively, to the opening of the gap in the nodal direction and throughout the Fermi surface. Our self-energy data show that the evolution between the two regimes occurs in a gradual way (crossover) and also that at low enough temperatures the whole Fermi surface is always gapped. Furthermore, we present a comparison of our DΓA calculations at a parameter set where data obtained by other techniques are available.}

By analyzing how momentum- and frequency-dependent fluctuations generate the d-wave superconducting state in different representations, we identify antiferromagnetic fluctuations as the pairing glue of superconductivity in both the underdoped and the overdoped regime. Nevertheless, in the intermediate coupling regime, the predominant magnetic fluctuations may differ significantly from those described by conventional spin fluctuation theory.}}

abstract = {We present the first open release of the DCA++ project, a high-performance research software framework to solve quantum many-body problems with cutting edge quantum cluster algorithms. DCA++ implements the dynamical cluster approximation (DCA) and its DCA+ extension with a continuous self-energy. The algorithms capture nonlocal correlations in strongly correlated electron systems, thereby giving insight into high-Tc superconductivity. The code’s scalability allows efficient usage of systems at all scales, from workstations to leadership computers. With regard to the increasing heterogeneity of modern computing machines, DCA++ provides portable performance on conventional and emerging new architectures, such as hybrid CPU–GPU, sustaining multiple petaflops on ORNL’s Titan and CSCS’ Piz Daint supercomputers. Moreover, we show how sustainable and scalable development of the code base has been achieved by adopting standard techniques of the software industry. These include employing a distributed version control system, applying test-driven development and following continuous integration.

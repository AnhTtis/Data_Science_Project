    "abstract": "The ability to control the properties of twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides in situ makes them an ideal platform for investigating the interplay of strong correlations and geometric frustration. Of particular interest are the low energy scales, which make it possible to experimentally access both temperature and magnetic fields that are of the order of the bandwidth or the correlation scale. In this manuscript we analyze the moiré Hubbard model, believed to describe the low energy physics of an important subclass of the twisted bilayer compounds. We establish its magnetic and the metal-insulator phase diagram for the full range of magnetic fields up to the fully spin polarized state. We find a rich phase diagram including fully and partially polarized insulating and metallic phases of which we determine the interplay of magnetic order, Zeeman-field, and metallicity, and make connection to recent experiments.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a framework that recommends music based on the emotions of speech. In content creation and daily life, speech contains information about human emotions, which can be enhanced by music. Our framework focuses on a cross-domain retrieval system to bridge the gap between speech and music via emotion labels. We explore different speech representations and report their impact on different speech types, including acting voice and wake-up words. We also propose an emotion similarity regularization term in cross-domain retrieval tasks. By incorporating the regularization term into training, similar speech-and-music pairs in the emotion space are closer in the joint embedding space. Our comprehensive experimental results show that the proposed model is effective in textless speech-to-music retrieval.",

%% Text of abstract
In this paper, we implement a generalised pseudo-Newtonian potential and prescribe a numerical fitting formalism to study the off-equatorial orbits inclined at a certain angle with the equatorial plane around both Schwarzschild and Kerr-like compact object primaries surrounded by a dipolar halo of matter. The chaotic dynamics of the orbits are detailed for both non-relativistic and special-relativistic test particles. The dependence of the degree of chaos on the rotation parameter $a$ and the inclination angle $i$ is established individually using widely used indicators, such as the Poincar\'e Map and the Lyapunov Characteristic Number. We find that although the chaoticity of the orbits has a positive correlation with $i$, the growth in the chaotic behaviour is not systematic. There exists a threshold value of the inclination angle $i_{\text{c}}$, after which the degree of chaos shows a sharp increase. On the other hand, the chaoticity of the inclined orbits anti-correlates with $a$ throughout its entire range. However, the negative correlation is systematic at lower values of the inclination angle. At higher values of $i$, the degree of chaos is maximum for the maximally counter-rotating compact objects, the Kerr parameter of which is below a threshold value $a_{\text{c}}$. Above this threshold value, the correlation becomes weak. Furthermore, we establish a qualitative correlation between the threshold values and the overall chaoticity. The studies performed with different orbital parameters and several initial conditions reveal the intricate nature of the system.

\section{Introduction}
In the past few years, the study of the dynamics of orbits around a single Black Hole (BH hereafter) \citep[e.g.][and references therein]{nag2017influence, polcar2019free, dubeibe2021effect} or a BH binary \citep[e.g.][and references therein]{dubeibe2017pseudo, de2021beyond, alrebdi2022equilibrium} has become very popular. With the instrumental development of the detection and measuring techniques, it is already established that most of the galaxies consist of supermassive BHs at their galactic centres \citep{kormendy1995inward, beckmann2012active}. In almost all cases, the BHs are usually surrounded by a hollow spherical halo of matter and large accretion disks around them \citep{panagia1996nature, meyer1997formation}. Any particle travelling within the disk region or the corona will be influenced by both the central BH and the halo around it, and both of them need to be considered while looking for the locus of the particle. This is where the Core-Shell Model comes into the picture while modelling systems like these \citep{vieira1999relativistic}. Not only the stand-alone BHs or neutron stars with accretion disks around them but even the galaxies can be modelled using the core-shell scheme because of the observational evidence of their structures which consist of huge rings and shells around the supermassive BHs located at their individual galactic centres \citep{sackett1990dark, arnaboldi1993studies, reshetnikov1997global, malin1983catalog, quinn1984formation, dupraz1987dynamical}.

In the present work, we are mostly focusing on the two-body system, where one of them is a rotating or a non-rotating compact object primary (COP hereafter) surrounded by a hollow halo of matter, and the other one is a test particle with a unit mass. While studying the dynamics of the orbit of the test particle around the COP, the phenomenon of chaos naturally comes into the picture. Several works have already been done on the chaotic behaviour of the orbits under the influence of the fully relativistic gravitational field of a BH-halo system \citep{vieira1996chaos, letelier1997chaos, vieira1999relativistic, gueron2002geodesic, vogt2003exact, semerak2010free, semerak2012free, sukova2013free, janiuk2011different, witzany2015free}. Incorporating the charge into the system also brings out interesting results where the charged test particle is influenced by the gravitational field as well as the magnetic force of the central BH along with its magnetosphere \citep{kopavcek2014inducing, kopavcek2015regular, takahashi2009chaotic, vittorio2021detection, vittorio2021timescales}. The spin of the COP plays an important role in the orbital dynamics around it. As most of the BHs are rotating in nature \citep{miller2009stellar, ziolkowski2010population, daly2011estimates, reynolds2012probing, dotti2012orientation, tchekhovskoy2012prograde, garofalo2013retrograde, healy2014remnant, sesana2014linking}, we are more interested in studying the chaotic dynamics of the orbits around a Kerr-like BH, or a COP in general. 

While many research groups encounter the problem of accretion dynamics with a fully relativistic approach, it is very intensive and computationally demanding to simulate these systems exactly. Therefore, we can follow a beyond-Newtonian approach or a pseudo-Keplerian formalism, where a Newtonian-like potential is designed in such a way that it mimics the actual potential by sustaining the essential aspects of the spacetime around the COP within a feasible limit of error. Certainly, the mimicking potential, known as the pseudo-Newtonian potential (PNP hereafter), will not exactly reproduce the fully relativistic scenario because of the nonlinearity in space-time close to the event horizon. Nevertheless, it reproduces spacetime far from the event horizon with a high degree of accuracy as the relativistic nonlinearity weakens in this region. Furthermore, it simplifies the calculation and the computation significantly. Such a PNP was first developed by \citet{paczynsky1980thick} (PW hereafter), which is applicable for the orbits on or near the equatorial plane of a Schwarzschild-like COP. After the successful implementation of this PNP, many pseudo-potentials were introduced for both Schwarzschild and Kerr-type COPs, each with different sets of advantages and drawbacks \citep{nowak1991diskoseismology, chakrabarti1992newtonian, Semerak1999pseudo, mukhopadhyay2002description, mukhopadhyay2003pseudo, ghosh2004rotating, chakrabarti2006studies}. Till now, one of the most popular and widely implemented PNPs for a Kerr-like COP is the one developed in \citet{artemova1996modified} (ABN hereafter). However, all of the mentioned PNPs are applicable to the orbits near the equatorial plane. Even if they are prescribed for thick accretion disks, they do not include the inclination of the orbit in their models. For this reason, hardly any study has been done on the chaotic behaviour of inclined orbits in a pseudo-Newtonian framework. Nonetheless, a few studies have been performed on the dynamics of the off-equatorial orbits in a fully relativistic formalism \citep{kovavr2008off, kovavr2010off, barausse2007circular}. However, the chaotic nature of the equatorial orbits, and their correlation with the rotation parameter, has been widely studied using the previously available PNPs \citep{gueron2001chaos, gueron2001chaotic, chen2003chaotic, letelier2011chaotic, wang2012dynamics, nag2017influence}. 

The potential developed in \citet{ghosh2007} (GM hereafter) gives us the opportunity to look for the chaotic dynamics of the off-equatorial orbits inclined at a certain angle $i$ with the equatorial plane. The generalised PNP is useful to study the accretion dynamics around rotating and non-rotating BHs in the off-equatorial planes \citep{ghosh2014newtonian}. The vector potential, derived from the generalised pseudo-Keplerian gravitational force prescribed in GM, is also suitable for the hydrodynamical accretion studies of thick accretion disks \citep{bhattacharya2010disk}. Besides its applicability over a wide range of inclination angles ($0^\circ \leq i \leq 30^\circ$), the potential is valid for the entire range of the rotation parameter of the COP ($-1 \leq a < 1$). As the PNP is directly developed from the spacetime metric, it reproduces the values of the radius of marginally bound orbit $R_{\text{mb}}$, and the efficiency of unit mass at marginally stable orbit $E_{\text{ms}}$ with minimal error, and the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit $R_{\text{ISCO}}$ with no error at all. This helps us in implementing this PNP to look at how the chaoticity of the off-equatorial orbits depends on the entire range of the Kerr parameter, as well as the angle of inclination. The PNP sustains the frame-dragging effect (FDE), which is a significant characteristic of the relativistic Kerr geometry. 

As mentioned earlier, we have used the core-shell model in the present work because it closely resembles the realistic picture of an actual astrophysical BH \citep{vieira1999relativistic}. We have used a dipolar perturbative term signifying the hollow halo of matter around the COP. As opposed to the quadrupolar term used in this regard \citep{wang2012dynamics}, the dipolar term will be predominant when the halo is somewhat asymmetrically placed about the equatorial plane of the COP, even if it is axially symmetric about the rotations axis of the system. The asymmetric mass distribution of the halo about the equatorial plane is more practical \citep{binney2008}. The dipolar term, corresponding to this asymmetric halo, has been used several times in literature \citep{gueron2001chaos, nag2017influence}.

In the current piece of work, we have implemented the PNP presented by GM to study the off-equatorial orbits around a Schwarzschild and a Kerr-like COP. The paper is organised as follows. In section \ref{ch:description_of_PNP}, we have given a brief description of the PNPs and a numerical scheme to study the off-equatorial orbits. Along with that, we have presented the required equations of motion for both non-relativistic and special relativistic test particles. In section \ref{ch:chaos_poincare}, we study the stability of both circular and generic orbits. In the case of the latter, we use the previously mentioned equations of motion to study the chaotic dynamics of the orbits by generating the Poincar\'e Maps of their phase-space trajectories. Through the analysis, we establish a correlation of the degree of chaos with the inclination angle $i$ of the orbit, and the Kerr parameter $a$ of the COP, in a qualitative manner. In section \ref{ch:lyapunov}, we quantify the chaoticity using the Maximum Lyapunov Exponent (MLE hereafter) and Lyapunov Characteristic Number (LCN hereafter), and we implement them to corroborate the previously obtained qualitative results to analyse the chaotic correlations in more depth. Finally, in section \ref{ch:conclusion}, we conclude our findings and discuss the future directions of our research.

\section{Formulation of the pseudo-Newtonian potentials and the equations of motion} \label{ch:description_of_PNP}
We begin our study by providing a mathematical description of the PNPs, along with the necessary equations of motion to study the orbital dynamics of the system. For the special case of equatorial orbits, we compare the effective potential consisting of GM PNP with that of ABN PNP, another well-established PNP widely used in this regard.

\subsection{Pseudo-Newtonian potential} \label{sch:PNP}
\begin{figure*}
        \centering
	\includegraphics[trim={20cm 0 12cm 0}, clip, width=0.7\columnwidth]{1}
    \caption{Different dynamical parameters of an off-equatorial orbit around a COP. The inclined plane consists of a circular orbit along which the test particle is rotating. The orbit is inclined at an angle $i$ with the symmetry axis of the COP (the $z$-axis), as well as its equatorial plane. The rotation parameter of the COP is $a$. $L$ denotes the total angular momentum of the test particle, and its direction is along the rotating axis of the inclined orbit.}
    \label{fig:off-equatorial plane}
\end{figure*}
If a particle of unit mass is accreting around a rotating COP of mass $M_{\text{BH}}$ and angular momentum $J_\phi$ on a plane inclined at an angle $i$ with the equatorial plane of the COP (Figure \ref{fig:off-equatorial plane}), the generalised gravitational force on the particle, as prescribed by GM, can be mimicked by the expression  
\begin{equation} \label{eq:GMPNF}
    F_{\text{GM} r}=\frac{2 \mathcal{A}^2\sec^2i}{\left[a\sqrt{2}r^{3/2}\left\{\Delta+2r\left(r-1\right)\right\}+r\Delta\sqrt{ \left\{\mathcal{A}+r^4-a^2(\Delta+r^2-3r)\right\} \cos2i\sec^2i}\right]^2}
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{A}=a^4+r^4+2a^2r(r-2)$ and $\Delta=r^2+a^2-2r$. The Kerr parameter $a=J_\phi / M_{\text{BH}}$ denotes the rotation parameter of the COP, such that $a\in[-1,1)$. Here, $r$ is the radial distance of the rotating particle from the origin in the spherical polar coordinate $(r,\theta,\phi)$. The gravitational force on the particles, given in equation (\ref{eq:GMPNF}), can be applied successfully by taking the value of $i$ in the range $i\in[0^\circ,30^\circ]$ while keeping the error within a reasonable limit, and maintaining a resemblance with the actual physical scenario \citep{ghosh2007}. The corresponding pseudo-Kerr potential $V_{\text{GM}}$, for particular values of $a$ and $i$, can be evaluated from the generalised force using the relation
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Pot_Def}
    V_{\text{GM}}(r,a,i)=-\int_r^\infty F_{\text{GM} r}(r',a,i)dr'
\end{equation}

For Schwarzschild-like COPs, the value of $a$ becomes $0$. Thus, by putting $a=0$ in the equation (\ref{eq:Pot_Def}), we get the PNP for the inclined orbits around a Schwarzschild-like COP, which is given by
\begin{equation} \label{eq:GMPW}
    V_{\text{GMS}}(r)=-\frac{\sec(2i)}{r-2}
\end{equation}
It should be mentioned that throughout the work, the velocities have been scaled by $c$, the speed of light in vacuum, and the distances are scaled by $r_{\text{g}}=GM_{\text{BH}}/c^2$, where $G$ is the gravitational constant and $M_{\text{BH}}$ is the mass of the COP. We have scaled all the parameters such that $G=M_{\text{BH}}=c=1$.

The potential, given in equation (\ref{eq:GMPW}) is strikingly similar to the PNP presented in PW. By putting $i=0$, $V_{\text{GMS}}$ gets equal to the PW potential. The fact that $V_{\text{GM}}$ comes down to the PW potential for $a=i=0$ signifies the generic nature of the GM PNP. Similarly, if we put $i=0$ but $a\neq 0$, we get the PNP for the orbits on the equatorial plane in the Kerr geometry. 

The analytically closed form of the generalised PNP $V_{\text{GM}}$, however, is extremely difficult to derive by a straightforward integration, as per the expression given in equation (\ref{eq:Pot_Def}), because of the complex mathematical form of the gravitational force, given in equation (\ref{eq:GMPNF}). Therefore, we take a numerical approach where we integrate the generalised force $F_{\text{GM} r}$ numerically for several values of $r$ and fit the data with a fitting function of the form 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:GMPNP}
    V_{\text{GMf}}(r)=-\frac{\exp\left(\frac{\gamma_1}{(r-\gamma_2)^{\gamma_3}}+\gamma_4\right)}{(r-\gamma_2)^{\gamma_5}}
\end{equation}
where $\gamma_1,\gamma_2,\gamma_3,\gamma_4$, and $\gamma_5$ are fitting parameters. It is evident that the potential $V_{\text{GMf}}$ is spherically symmetric, similar to the potential $V_{\text{GM}}$. The fitting function asymptotically approaches zero when the test particle moves towards infinity $\left( V_{\text{GMf}} \rightarrow 0 \text{, when } r \rightarrow \infty \right)$. Also, it tends to infinity when the test particle approaches the event horizon at the radial distance $r=\gamma_2 r_{\text{g}}$ $\left( V_{\text{GMf}} \rightarrow - \infty \text{, when } r \rightarrow \gamma_2 \right)$. Moreover, the function $V_{\text{GMf}}$ fits the PNP $V_{\text{GM}}$ efficiently with a minimal relative error, keeping the radii of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO hereafter) $R_{\text{ISCO}}$, and the marginally bound orbit $R_{\text{mb}}$ to be almost same as that in the Kerr geometry. These facts satisfy the conditions of a PNP, and it leads us to implement $V_{\text{GMf}}$, given in equation (\ref{eq:GMPNP}), as a suitable fitting function. For particular values of $a$ and $i$, the fitting parameters are evaluated so that $V_{\text{GMf}}$ fits with $V_{\text{GM}}$, and we can use the fitting function as an independent PNP. More details about the fitting methodology are presented in section \ref{ch:chaos_poincare}.

As the GM PNP is generic in nature, it is worthwhile to ask how this potential will behave for the orbits on the equatorial plane around a rotating COP ($i=0$ but $a \neq 0$) and how this potential differs from any other PNP which is being applied in this scenario. In the literature, many well-established PNPs have been successfully used in the past for equatorial accretion disks (as referred to earlier in this paper). We consider the well-known ABN PNP and compare it with GMf PNP for $i=0$. 

The ABN PNP, after integrating the free-fall acceleration prescribed in \citet{artemova1996modified}, comes out to be
\begin{equation} \label{eq:APNP}
    V_{\text{ABN}}(r)=-\frac{1}{r_1 (\beta-1)} \left[ \frac{r^{\beta-1}}{(r-r_1)^{\beta -1}} -1 \right]
\end{equation}
Here, $r_1$ represents the radius of the event horizon, given as follows.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:ABN_event_horizon}
    r_1 = 1+\sqrt{1-a^2}
\end{equation}
The value of $\beta$ is given by
\begin{equation} \label{eq:ABN_beta}
    \beta=\frac{r_{\text{in}}}{r_1}-1
\end{equation}
where $r_{\text{in}}$ is the radius of ISCO such that
\begin{equation} \label{eq:ABN_r_in}
    r_{\text{in}}=3+Z_2 \mp \sqrt{(3-Z_1)(3+Z_1+2Z_2)}
\end{equation}
The values of the parameters $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ are defined as
\begin{equation}
    Z_1=1+(1-a^2)^{\frac{1}{3}} \left[ (1+a)^{\frac{1}{3}}+(1-a)^{\frac{1}{3}} \right] \text{ and }
    Z_2=\sqrt{3a^2+Z_1^2}
\end{equation}
The negative and positive signs in equation (\ref{eq:ABN_r_in}) signify the co-rotating ($a>0$) and counter-rotating ($a<0$) COPs, respectively.

As there is azimuthal symmetry in the orbital motion of the particle revolving around a COP, it is convenient to write equation (\ref{eq:GMPNP}) in the cylindrical polar coordinates $(\rho,\phi,z)$ as 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:monopole}
    V_{\text{GMf}}(\rho,z)=-\frac{\exp\left(\frac{\gamma_1}{\left(\sqrt{\rho^2+z^2}-\gamma_2\right)^{\gamma_3}}+\gamma_4\right)}{\left(\sqrt{\rho^2+z^2}-\gamma_2\right)^{\gamma_5}}
\end{equation}
The absence of any $\phi$ term in the potential signifies the azimuthal symmetry. 

Along with the monopole term presented in equation (\ref{eq:monopole}), which is conservative, we use a dipolar, non-central, perturbative term which is introduced to simulate a halo far from the central object. The distribution of the halo is such that it is axially symmetric about the rotating axis of the COP. If the halo is also symmetric about the equatorial plane, which is the case for the prolate or the oblate geometry, the first non-central, contributing term in the potential will be quadrupolar in nature with an analytical, Newtonian form 
\begin{equation}
    \psi_{\text{quad}}=\mathcal{Q} r^2 P_2(\cos \theta) = \frac{1}{2} \mathcal{Q} \left( 2 z^2 - \rho^2 \right)
\end{equation}
as given in the literature \citep{vieira1999relativistic, wang2012dynamics}. Here, $\mathcal{Q}$ is the quadrupole coefficient, $P_n(x)$ is the Legendre polynomial of degree $n$, $\cos \theta = z/r$, and $r^2 = \rho^2 + z^2$. However, we consider the halo to be asymmetrically placed about the equatorial plane, somewhat deformed in the polar regions \citep{binney2008}. In this case, the non-central, leading term will be dipolar, which can be represented with a Newtonian potential 
\begin{equation}
    \psi_{\text{dip}} = \mathcal{D} r P_1(\cos \theta) = \mathcal{D} z
\end{equation}
Here, $\mathcal{D}$ is the dipole coefficient. The value of $\mathcal{D}$ will depend on the asymmetry in the mass distribution of the halo, and it will be small for any practical system \citep{vieira1999relativistic, nag2017influence}. Therefore, the net potential that the particle is experiencing while revolving around a COP surrounded by an asymmetrically distributed halo can be represented by a linear superposition of the potentials
\begin{equation} \label{eq:phi_g}
    \Phi_{\text{g}}(\rho,z)=V_{\text{PNP}}(\rho,z)+\psi_{\text{dip}}
\end{equation}
The pseudo-potential term $V_{\text{PNP}}$ in equation (\ref{eq:phi_g}) will be replaced by either of the monopole terms, which is $V_{\text{GM}}$, $V_{\text{GMS}}$, $V_{\text{GMf}}$, or $V_{\text{ABN}}$, depending on the nature of the COP under consideration. The linear nature of the Newtonian framework allows the superposition of the potentials, in this case \citep{wang2012dynamics}. 

The orbit of the test particle, with specific angular momentum $L$, is inclined with respect to the equatorial plane with an inclination angle $i$, and it is precessing about the spinning axis of the COP. This phenomenon is known as the Lense-Thirring Precession \citep{lense1918influence}. The $z$-component of the angular momentum $L_z$ is conserved due to the azimuthal symmetry of the orbit. The locus of the particle will not always make an angle $i$ with the equatorial plane. Still, the plane of orbital precession will always be inclined at $i$ with the spinning axis of the COP (Figure \ref{fig:off-equatorial plane}). Therefore, $L_z=L \cos i$, which implies that $L$ is also conserved \citep{ghosh2007}. 

The motion of the orbiting particle in the $\phi$ direction will induce a centrifugal force on it along the radial direction. This can be taken into account by adding a term $\left( \dfrac{L^2}{2\rho^2} \right)$ with the potential $\Phi_{\text{g}}(\rho,z)$ in equation (\ref{eq:phi_g}). Hence, the following expression can describe the effective potential in Kerr geometry.  
\begin{equation} \label{eq:overall_potential_general}
    \left.V_{\text{eff}}(\rho,z)\right|_{a \neq 0}=-\frac{\exp\left(\frac{\gamma_1}{\left(\sqrt{\rho^2+z^2}-\gamma_2\right)^{\gamma_3}}+\gamma_4\right)}{\left(\sqrt{\rho^2+z^2}-\gamma_2\right)^{\gamma_5}}+\mathcal{D} z+\frac{L^2}{2\rho^2}
\end{equation}
The net potential for an off-equatorial orbit in Schwarzschild geometry $(a=0)$ is more straightforward. We can use the potential given in equation (\ref{eq:GMPW}) and write down the net effective potential as follows.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:overall_potential_Sch}
    \left.V_{\text{eff}}(\rho,z)\right|_{a=0}=-\frac{\sec(2i)}{\sqrt{\rho^2+z^2}-2}+\mathcal{D} z+\frac{L^2}{2\rho^2}
\end{equation}
The dynamics of the test particle will be governed by these effective potentials, the choice of which depends on the type of COP it is rotating around. 

\subsection{Equations of motion} \label{sch:EOM}
We move on to formulating the equations of motion for our system. The equations of motion of the test particle can be derived from the non-dimensional Hamiltonian \citep{wang2011gravitational, wang2012dynamics}, given by
\begin{equation}
    H = \frac{1}{2} \left( p_\rho^2 + p_z^2 \right) + V_{\text{eff}} (\rho,z)
\end{equation}
where $V_{\text{eff}}$ can be replaced by either the potential given in equation (\ref{eq:overall_potential_general}) for a Kerr-like COP or the one given in equation (\ref{eq:overall_potential_Sch}) for a Schwarzschild-like COP. Thus, the equations of motion can be formulated as follows.
\begin{subequations} \label{eq:eom_nrel}
	\begin{alignat} {4}
		&\label{eq:rho_dot_nrel}\dot{\rho}=p_\rho\\
		&\label{eq:prho_dot_nrel}\dot{p_\rho}=-\frac{\partial V_{\text{eff}}}{\partial \rho}=-\frac{\partial \Phi_{\text{g}}}{\partial \rho}+\frac{L^2}{\rho^3}\\ 
		&\label{eq:z_dot_nrel}\dot{z}=p_z\\
		&\label{eq:pz_dot_nrel}\dot{p_z}=-\frac{\partial V_{\text{eff}}}{\partial z}=-\frac{\partial \Phi_{\text{g}}}{\partial z}
	\end{alignat}
\end{subequations}
Here, there is no special relativistic correction as the speed of the particle is assumed to be much less than $c$. The energy of the test particle is given by $E=\sqrt{1+2E_{\text{mech}}}$, where 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:energy_mechanical}
    E_{\text{mech}} = \frac{1}{2} \left( p_\rho^2 + p_z^2 \right) + \Phi_{\text{g}} (\rho,z) + \frac{L^2}{2\rho^2}
\end{equation}
Therefore, the conservation equation can be written as 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:energy_cons_newt}
    E^2 - p_\rho^2 - p_z^2 - 2\Phi_{\text{g}} - \frac{L^2}{\rho^2} = 1
\end{equation}
From equation (\ref{eq:energy_cons_newt}), it can be concluded that the motion of the test particle will be restricted by $E^2 - 2\Phi_{\text{g}} - \dfrac{L^2}{\rho^2} - 1 \geq 0$, which is a direct consequence of the conservation of energy and angular momentum. 

However, if the speed of the particle is comparable to the speed of light, special relativistic corrections to the equations in (\ref{eq:rho_dot_nrel}-\ref{eq:pz_dot_nrel}) have to be performed \citep{nag2017influence,gueron2001chaos}. We consider the non-dimensional Lagrangian of the relativistic particle $\mathcal{L}=-\dfrac{1}{\gamma}-\Phi_{\text{g}}$, where the term $\gamma$ is given by
\begin{equation*}
    \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\left( \dot{\rho}^2 + \rho^2 \dot{\phi}^2 + \dot{z}^2 \right)}}
\end{equation*}
The energy of the particle will be $E=\gamma+\Phi_{\text{g}}$, and the angular momentum of the particle will be $L=\dfrac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \dot{\phi}}=\gamma \rho^2 \dot{\phi}$. The Lagrange’s equations for $\rho$ and $z$ can be found as
\begin{subequations} \label{eq:lagrange_eqn}
	\begin{alignat} {2}
		&\label{eq:lagrange_eqn_rho}\left( \Phi_{\text{g}} - E \right)\Ddot{\rho} = \frac{\partial \Phi_{\text{g}}}{\partial \rho} \left( 1- \dot{\rho}^2 \right) - \frac{\partial \Phi_{\text{g}}}{\partial z} \dot{\rho} \dot{z} - \frac{L^2}{(E-\Phi_{\text{g}}) \rho^3}\\
		&\label{eq:lagrange_eqn_z}\left( \Phi_{\text{g}} - E \right)\Ddot{z} = \frac{\partial \Phi_{\text{g}}}{\partial z} \left( 1- \dot{z}^2 \right) - \frac{\partial \Phi_{\text{g}}}{\partial \rho} \dot{\rho} \dot{z}
	\end{alignat}
\end{subequations}
As we have considered the test particle of unit mass, we can write $\dot{\rho}=p_\rho$ and $\dot{z}=p_z$. Thus, the relativistic equations of motion turn out to be
\begin{subequations} \label{eq:eom_rel}
	\begin{alignat} {4}
		&\label{eq:rho_dot_rel}\dot{\rho}=p_\rho\\
		&\label{eq:prho_dot_rel}\dot{p_\rho}=\frac{1}{\Phi_{\text{g}}-E}\left[ \frac{\partial \Phi_{\text{g}}}{\partial \rho} \left(1-p_\rho^2 \right)-\frac{\partial \Phi_{\text{g}}}{\partial z}p_z p_\rho - \frac{L^2}{(E-\Phi_{\text{g}}) \rho^3} \right]\\ 
		&\label{eq:z_dot_rel}\dot{z}=p_z\\
		&\label{eq:pz_dot_rel}\dot{p_z}=\frac{1}{\Phi_{\text{g}}-E}\left[ \frac{\partial \Phi_{\text{g}}}{\partial z} \left(1-p_z^2 \right)-\frac{\partial \Phi_{\text{g}}}{\partial \rho}p_z p_\rho \right]
	\end{alignat}
\end{subequations}
From the expressions of energy $E$ and angular momentum $L$, along with the relation $u^\mu u_\mu = 1$, the conservation equation can be evaluated as
\begin{equation} \label{eq:energy_cons}
    p_\rho^2+p_z^2+\frac{L^2}{(E-\Phi_{\text{g}})^2 \rho^2}+\frac{1}{(E-\Phi_{\text{g}})^2}=1
\end{equation}
Similar to the non-relativistic case, the motion of the particle will be restricted within the region governed by $1-\dfrac{L^2}{(E-\Phi_{\text{g}})^2 \rho^2}-\dfrac{1}{(E-\Phi_{\text{g}})^2} \geq 1$.

It is worth mentioning that similar to the velocities and distances, all the terms signifying the physical quantities have been scaled to make them non-dimensional. The time $t$ has been scaled as $ct/r_{\text{g}}$, the momentum $p$ has been scaled as $p/(\mu c)$, and the angular momentum has been scaled as $L/(\mu c r_{\text{g}})$, where $\mu$ is the mass of the test particle taken to be unity in our analysis. 

The energy conservation equations, given in equation (\ref{eq:energy_cons_newt}) for non-relativistic case and equation (\ref{eq:energy_cons}) for relativistic case, converts the 4-dimensional phase space consisting of $(\rho,p_\rho,z,p_z)$ into an effective 3-dimensional hypersurface consisting of $(\rho,p_\rho,z)$. The value of $p_z$ is bound to satisfy equation (\ref{eq:energy_cons}) for a particular set of the values of $(\rho,p_\rho,z)$. This provides comprehensibility in analyzing the system and also gives the advantage of minimizing errors in numerical calculations.

\subsection{Comparison between GMf PNP and ABN PNP for equatorial orbits} \label{sch:comp_GMf_ABN}
Before implementing the GMf PNP in studying the off-equatorial orbits, it is essential to consider the PNP for the equatorial orbits by putting the inclination angle $i=0^\circ$. In this context, we compare the two pseudo-potentials, namely the GMf PNP and the ABN PNP, and investigate which is more appropriate for sustaining the essential aspects of general relativity. Both potentials reproduce the radii of the innermost stable circular orbits ($R_{\text{ISCO}}$) to be precisely the same as that in the fully relativistic case. Both of them reproduce the values of the radii of marginally bound orbits ($R_{\text{mb}}$) and the energy of unit mass at the marginally stable orbits ($E_{\text{ms}}$) with similar accuracy. The margin of dissimilarity being significantly less, both the PNPs can be implemented efficiently to study the accretion dynamics of equatorial disks. However, the simpler mathematical form of ABN PNP makes it more comprehensive and convenient to implement in complicated mathematical problems, for example, the Hill problem \cite{steklain2009stability}. For off-equatorial orbits, the GM PNP is possibly one of the mandatory choices, despite having a complex mathematical form.

\end{figure*}

If we find out the differences between the two PNPs for higher radial distances far from the event horizon, we can see a trend in their behaviour which has a correlation with the rotation parameter $a$. Let us consider the effective potential $V(r)$ consisting of the GMf PNP $V_{\text{GMf}}(r)$, or the ABN PNP $V_{\text{ABN}}(r)$, along with the centrifugal contribution $\left( \dfrac{L^2}{2r^2} \right)$. At $a=0$, which represents a Schwarzschild-like COP, both the PNPs come down to the PW PNP. That is why both ABN PNP and GMf PNP are equal to each other for $a=0$. For $a>0$, which represents a co-rotating Kerr-like COP, the effective potential consisting of the ABN PNP is more than that of the GMf PNP (Figure \ref{fig:comparison_of_potentials_a_1}-\ref{fig:comparison_of_potentials_a_3}). For $a<0$, which represents a counter-rotating Kerr-like COP, the situation is opposite (Figure \ref{fig:comparison_of_potentials_a_4}-\ref{fig:comparison_of_potentials_a_6}). In this case, the effective potential consisting of the ABN PNP is less compared to that of the GMf PNP. This impacts the chaotic behaviour of the equatorial orbits in some significant way, which has been studied in section \ref{ch:chaos_poincare}.

\section{Stability of orbits and visualization of chaos} \label{ch:chaos_poincare}

In this section, we analyse the dynamical behaviours of the orbits around Schwarzschild or Kerr-like COP. We begin with the special case of stable circular orbits. Thereafter, we move on to the behaviours of generic orbits, where the coexistence of order and chaos occurs naturally. We look for the transitions from order to chaos and establish how the chaoticity correlates with the orbital parameters qualitatively using the Poincar\'e sections of the orbits.

\subsection{Dynamical analysis of circular orbits}
A circular orbit essentially satisfies the relations $\dot{r}=0$ and $\dot{p_r}=0$. As the gravitational force corresponding to the PNPs is central in nature, we can expect stable circular orbits to exist around the COPs. However, the dipolar perturbation term in equation (\ref{eq:phi_g}) restricts the stable circular orbits to exist on any plane other than the equatorial plane where the dipolar term vanishes as $z=0$. In the off-equatorial planes, the dipolar term ruins the spherical symmetry of the system. However, we are also interested in considering the off-equatorial planes. Therefore, we suppress the dipolar term for the time being by putting $\mathcal{D}=0$ in equation (\ref{eq:phi_g}).  

For an orbit around a COP with specific values of $a$ and $i$ to be circular, the relation $\dfrac{\partial V_{\text{eff}}}{\partial r}=0$ is required to be satisfied. In order for it to be stable, the extremum has to be a minimum. Therefore, the condition for an orbit to be a stable circular orbit turns out to be
\begin{equation} \label{eq:stability_cond}
    \frac{\partial V_{\text{eff}}}{\partial r}=0 \text{, and } \frac{\partial^2 V_{\text{eff}}}{\partial r^2} \geq 0
\end{equation}
Instead of the inequality, if we equate the second relation in equation (\ref{eq:stability_cond}) with 0 and solve the equations simultaneously, the solution essentially gives the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit for given values of $a$ and $i$ \cite{shapiro1983black}.

        \label{fig:ISCO_with_a_i}
\end{figure*}

In Figure \ref{fig:ISCO_with_a_i}, we study the dependence of the radii of ISCOs with the rotation parameter of the COP $a$ and the inclination of the orbit $i$. At first, we observe that the change in $R_{\text{ISCO}}$ with respect to the Kerr parameter $a$ is significant (Figures \ref{fig:ISCO_with_a_i_1} and \ref{fig:ISCO_with_a_i_2}). For the equatorial orbits with $i=0^\circ$, the radii change from $\approx 9 r_{\text{g}}$ to $\approx 1.5 r_{\text{g}}$ in the span of $a \in [-1,1)$. We can notice that the change in $R_{\text{ISCO}}$ with respect to $a$ for GMf PNP (Figure \ref{fig:ISCO_with_a_i_2} with $i=0^\circ$) is exactly similar to that for ABN PNP (Figure \ref{fig:ISCO_with_a_i_1}). In both cases, the value of $R_{\text{ISCO}}$ is almost linearly decreasing for most of the range of $a$, except for the orbits around the maximally co-rotating COPs, in which case the change in $R_{\text{ISCO}}$ is more drastic. The result is not surprising for GM PNP, as it gives the radii of ISCOs to be exactly the same as that in a fully relativistic analysis, similar to the ABN PNP. However, it signifies the fitting efficiency of GMf PNP with the GM PNP.

In Figures \ref{fig:ISCO_with_a_i_3} and \ref{fig:ISCO_with_a_i_4}, we can see the dependence of $R_{\text{ISCO}}$ on the inclination angle $i$. In both cases, the change in the value of $R_{\text{ISCO}}$ in the range $i \in [0^\circ,30^\circ]$ is nominal. For the orbits around the counter-rotating COP, the value of $R_{\text{ISCO}}$ increases monotonically with $i$ (Figure \ref{fig:ISCO_with_a_i_3}). On the contrary, it decreases monotonically with the angle of inclination for the orbits around the co-rotating COPs (Figure \ref{fig:ISCO_with_a_i_4}). The radii change more rapidly at the higher values of $i$ compared to that at its lower values. Furthermore, we also observe that the radii of ISCOs are more affected by the angle of inclination for the counter-rotation COPs compared to the co-rotating COPs (Figure \ref{fig:ISCO_with_a_i_2}). The change in the values of $R_{\text{ISCO}}$ with respect to inclination angle $i$ is maximum for $a=-1$. For $a=0$, there is no change in the radius of ISCO as the inclination angle varies, and it remains unchanged at $R_{\text{ISCO}}=6 r_{\text{g}}$. The result is expected for the Schwarzschild-like COP, as there is no rotation axis to identify the equatorial plane. Hence, all the planes are equivalent, and there is no special plane to impose larger or smaller stability on the circular orbits. 

With the above analysis, we get a complete picture of the stable circular orbits in our system, including their dependence on the Kerr parameter $a$ and inclination angle $i$. We observed that the radii of ISCOs are significantly more influenced by $a$ in comparison to that by $i$. For orbits around counter-rotating COPs ($a<0$), $R_{\text{ISCO}}$ increases with $i$. On the other hand, it decreases with $i$ for the orbits around the co-rotating COPs ($a>0$). For the Schwarzschild-like COP ($a=0$), $R_{\text{ISCO}}$ does not change with $i$. However, generic orbits are much more complicated and nuanced, requiring more detailed analysis and special tools to study their stability. 

\subsection{Dynamical analysis of generic orbits}
We move on to the analysis of the generic orbits. As we discussed earlier, we require some special tools to study their nature of stability. We have implemented the method of Poincar\'e Map (PM hereafter) to visualize chaos and order in the system. In this method, instead of looking at the entire three-dimensional hypersurface $(\rho,p_\rho,z)$, we look at a two-dimensional cross-section of the phase space, which consists of the points of intersection of the trajectories on a fixed plane (such as $z=0$) while moving in a particular direction (either $p_z>0$ or $p_z<0$) along the trajectory \citep{berry1978topics}. The periodic orbits give rise to one or more isolated points on the sectional map, whereas the chaotic orbits give rise to a sea of scattered points \citep{berry1978topics, goldstein2001classical}. There can be other stable orbits, which are quasi-periodic regular orbits, forming systematic patterns in the map corresponding to the concentric Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) tori. Usually, the isolated points and the systematic patterns, known as the islands of order, are surrounded by these regions of chaos. This phenomenon is known as soft chaos, where the regular patterns and the chaotic points coexist simultaneously. On the contrary, the hard chaos is defined by the complete absence of the ordered islands. In almost all cases, we get to observe the soft chaos. Hard chaos is very rare in literature.

The PM allows us to look at the chaotic nature of the phase space qualitatively. It gives a visual impression of the overall chaoticity of the system for a given set of parameters. The system is said to be more chaotic when the islands of the regular patterns are less compared to the region of scattered points \citep{goldstein2001classical, nag2017influence}. It is a useful tool to look for how the degree of chaos correlates with different dynamical parameters of a system. If the chaotic behaviour of the system increases, the islands of regular orbits shrink or gradually collapse. The decrease in the allowed volume in the phase space also signifies the suppression of non-linearity in the system. 

In this paper, we have plotted the Poincar\'e sections on the $z=0$ plane, while the orbits are moving out of the plane along their trajectories in the phase space ($p_z>0$). For a particular set of orbital parameters, the initial conditions, \textit{i.e.}, the coordinates $\rho (t=0)$, $z (t=0)$ and the momentum $p_{\rho} (t=0)$, are varied, and the value of $p_z (t=0)$ is evaluated from the conservation equation (\ref{eq:energy_cons_newt}) for non-relativistic trajectories and conservation equation (\ref{eq:energy_cons}) for relativistic trajectories. We have made the orbits evolve for time steps $n=10^6$. We have concluded the dependence of chaos on a particular parameter through a comparative study of the PM plots by varying that parameter while keeping the rest fixed.

        \label{fig:PM_with_i_NonRel}
\end{figure*}

As the gravitational force, given in equation (\ref{eq:GMPNF}), is generic in nature, we can put $a=0$ in the expression and study the off-equatorial orbits around a static and stationary COP. We have implemented the effective potential, given in equation (\ref{eq:overall_potential_Sch}), and worked out the equations of motion as per the equations given in (\ref{eq:rho_dot_nrel}-\ref{eq:pz_dot_nrel}) which does not consider any relativistic correction. We have varied the inclination angle $i$ and generated the PM for each of the angles. We have shown the maps for $i=10^\circ,\text{ }13^\circ,\text{ }14.6^\circ,\text{ and } 15^\circ$ by keeping the total energy $E$, total angular momentum $L$, and dipole coefficient $\mathcal{D}$ unchanged (Figure \ref{fig:PM_with_i_NonRel}). We can observe an increasing trend in the chaotic behaviour as the angle $i$ increases. Evidently, the PM of the phase space for $i=15^\circ$ consists of a more chaotic region than that for $i=10^\circ$, in which case most of the orbits are regular in nature. It is to be noted that the allowed volume of phase space also enhances with the increase of the inclination angle. Therefore, this provides qualitative evidence that the degree of chaos has a positive correlation with the angle of inclination $i$ of the orbit.

        \label{fig:PM_with_i_Rel}
\end{figure*}

In order to incorporate the relativistic corrections into the equations, we have derived the equations of motion using equations given in (\ref{eq:rho_dot_rel}-\ref{eq:pz_dot_rel}). We solved these equations too, to get the PMs corresponding to the phase spaces of the orbits of relativistic test-particle and studied the trend of the degree of chaos with the inclination angle $i$ (Figure \ref{fig:PM_with_i_Rel}). Similar to the non-relativistic case, we have kept the parameter $E$, $L$, and $\mathcal{D}$ to be constant. We can observe the exact similar behaviour of the orbits, as we have seen in the non-relativistic case. The only difference is that we have used a smaller value of $E$ and a higher value of $L$ to suppress the nonlinearity of the relativistic equations of motion (\ref{eq:rho_dot_rel}-\ref{eq:pz_dot_rel}). This establishes that the relativistic phase-space trajectories are similar in nature to the corresponding non-relativistic counterparts but with lower energy and/or higher angular momentum of the orbiting particle. 

Actually, one can observe that the PM plots for the relativistic test particles are more chaotic than the corresponding non-relativistic counterparts \citep{nag2017influence}. This can be explained by the increase in nonlinearity in the equations of motion for the relativistic case (equation \ref{eq:rho_dot_rel}-\ref{eq:pz_dot_rel}) compared to the non-relativistic ones (equation \ref{eq:rho_dot_nrel}-\ref{eq:pz_dot_nrel}). It can also be shown that the chaoticity of these systems increases when energy $E$ is increasing and angular momentum $L$ is decreasing \citep{nag2017influence}. Combining these findings, we can conclude that this increased nonlinearity in the relativistic equations can be suppressed by reducing the energy $E$ or increasing the angular momentum $L$. However, the overall trend in the chaoticity will remain the same for both non-relativistic and relativistic trajectories.

\subsubsection{Rotating compact object primaries}
After considering the Schwarzschild geometry, we move on to the Kerr geometry, where the Kerr parameter $a$ is non-zero. In this case, for particular values of $a$ and $i$, we first evaluate the PNP $V_{\text{GM}}$ from equation (\ref{eq:Pot_Def}) for several values of $r$, using the generalised force $F_{\text{GMr}}$, given in equation (\ref{eq:GMPNF}). After that, we take the natural log of the potential values to fit the data with the logarithmic form of the fitting function in equation (\ref{eq:GMPNP}), which is given by
\begin{equation} \label{eq:log_GMPNP}
    \ln\left(-V_{\text{GMf}}(r)\right)=\frac{\gamma_1}{(r-\gamma_2)^{\gamma_3}}+\gamma_4 - \gamma_5\ln\left(r-\gamma_2\right)
\end{equation}
This allows us to fit the curve more conveniently with minimum error and evaluate the fitting parameters. After we estimate the values of the fitting parameters, we can use them in equation (\ref{eq:overall_potential_general}) to get the overall potential consisting of the GMf PNP term for particular values of $a$ and $i$, along with the dipolar perturbation term and the centrifugal contribution as well. Thereafter, we implement this potential in the equations (\ref{eq:rho_dot_nrel})-(\ref{eq:pz_dot_nrel}) and equations (\ref{eq:rho_dot_rel})-(\ref{eq:pz_dot_rel}) to get the equations of motion for non-relativistic and relativistic cases, respectively.

We can see the quality of fitting of GMf PNP with GM PNP in Figure \ref{fig:GMPNP_fitting_1} for $a=0.4$ and $i=20^\circ$, and Figure \ref{fig:GMPNP_fitting_3} for $a=-0.4$ and $i=20^\circ$. For the convenience of observation, we have shown fewer points of GM PNP in the figures. Otherwise, we use a large number of points for efficient fitting while performing actual calculations. We have generated the PM plots using the non-relativistic equations of motion for $a=\pm 0.4$, and $i=20^\circ$ (Figure \ref{fig:GMPNP_fitting_2} and \ref{fig:GMPNP_fitting_4}), for particular values of $\mathcal{D}$, $L$, and $E$. We can observe that, for $a=0.4$, most of the orbits are regular. In comparison to this, the PM plot for $a=-0.4$ is more chaotic as it consists of regular orbits surrounded by a significant area of chaotic regions. The weakening of chaos in the former occurs due to the dragging of the inertial frames around a co-rotating COP, which is a direct consequence of the Lense-Thirring Precession of the orbits around a Kerr-like COP \citep{lense1918influence, steklain2009stability, wang2012dynamics}.

We have already compared the effective potentials consisting of the GMf PNP with that of the ABN PNP in section \ref{sch:comp_GMf_ABN}. Now, we must compare the PM plots generated using the two potentials (Figure \ref{fig:PM_comparison_GMPNP_APNP}). Apparently, we are considering the orbits on the equatorial plane in this case ($i=0^\circ$). We can observe the usual frame-dragging effect (FDE hereafter) for GMf PNP (Figure \ref{fig:PM_comparison_GMPNP_APNP_1} and \ref{fig:PM_comparison_GMPNP_APNP_2}). The chaotic nature of the orbits for $a=-0.2$ is significantly higher than that for $a=0.2$. The FDE is also evident in the PMs corresponding to the orbits derived from ABN PNP (Figure \ref{fig:PM_comparison_GMPNP_APNP_3} and \ref{fig:PM_comparison_GMPNP_APNP_4}). The number of regular orbits has decreased significantly in the map for $a=-0.2$ compared to that for $a=0.2$. However, it is to be noted that the degree of chaos in the map for $a=0.2$ evaluated from GMf PNP (Figure \ref{fig:PM_comparison_GMPNP_APNP_1}) is more than that derived from ABN PNP (Figure \ref{fig:PM_comparison_GMPNP_APNP_3}). On the contrary, the chaotic nature of the orbits in the map for $a=-0.2$ evaluated from GMf PNP (Figure \ref{fig:PM_comparison_GMPNP_APNP_2}) is less compared to that derived from ABN PNP (Figure \ref{fig:PM_comparison_GMPNP_APNP_4}). This is the consequence of the result that we presented in section \ref{sch:comp_GMf_ABN}, where we made a comparison between the two PNPs (Figure \ref{fig:comparison_of_potentials_a}). The relative shift in the local minima of the effective potentials affects the chaotic behaviour of the orbits in the way we can see in Figure \ref{fig:PM_comparison_GMPNP_APNP} \citep{nag2017influence}.

In order to observe how the chaoticity of the inclined orbits changes with the rotation of the COP, we studied the chaotic nature of the orbits for the whole range of the Kerr parameter $\left( -1 \leq a < 1 \right)$. First, we consider the orbits with a relatively smaller value of inclination ($i=10^\circ$), along with particular values of dipole coefficient $\mathcal{D}$, energy $E$, and angular momentum $L$. We observe that the orbits around the counter-rotating COPs (Figures \ref{fig:PM_GMPNP_with_a_1_1}-\ref{fig:PM_GMPNP_with_a_1_3}) are more chaotic than that around the co-rotating ones (Figures \ref{fig:PM_GMPNP_with_a_1_4}-\ref{fig:PM_GMPNP_with_a_1_6}). For any negative value of $a$, we have examined the PM plot for the corresponding positive value of $a$ (\textit{e.g.}, Figure \ref{fig:PM_GMPNP_with_a_1_3} and Figure \ref{fig:PM_GMPNP_with_a_1_4} respectively). The former is apparently more chaotic than the latter for all the cases. This occurs because of the usual FDE. We can study the gradual change in the chaoticity from $a=-1$ to $a \approx +1$ from Figure \ref{fig:PM_GMPNP_with_a_1}. As the value of $a$ increases, we can observe the gradual formation of islands of regular orbits in the lower halves of the plots, which shows more chaotic behaviour than the corresponding upper halves. The allowed volume of the phase space decreases as well. The systematic suppression of chaos with respect to the Kerr parameter is evident. The trend in the chaoticity observed in this case has been corroborated quantitatively using the Lyapunov Characteristic Numbers in section \ref{ch:lyapunov}.

After considering a smaller value of the inclination angle, we move on to study the orbits with a higher angle of inclination. We considered the off-equatorial orbits with an angle of inclination $i=25^\circ$. We fixed the orbital parameters and varied the Kerr parameter $a$ to generate the PMs. For the orbits around a counter-rotating COP ($a<0$), the cross-sectional maps corresponding to some of the values of $a$ are presented in Figures \ref{fig:PM_GMPNP_with_a_2_1}-\ref{fig:PM_GMPNP_with_a_2_4}. We observe that the overall chaotic behaviour is significantly decreasing as the value of $a$ increases from $-1$ (Figure \ref{fig:PM_GMPNP_with_a_2_1}) to $-0.25$ (Figure \ref{fig:PM_GMPNP_with_a_2_3}). However, the change in the chaotic behaviour of the orbits seems to slow down above this value of the Kerr parameter. If we compare the PMs for $a=-0.01$ (Figure \ref{fig:PM_GMPNP_with_a_2_4}) and for $a=0.25$ (Figure \ref{fig:PM_GMPNP_with_a_2_5}), the allowed volume of the phase space remains to be unchanged as the value of the rotation parameter changes. Only a few of the orbits are transitioning from chaotic to regular. The number is even fewer if we compare the PMs for $a=0.25$ (Figure \ref{fig:PM_GMPNP_with_a_2_5}) and $a=0.6$ (Figure \ref{fig:PM_GMPNP_with_a_2_6}), in which case the overall change in not very significant at all. For $a=0.25$ (Figure \ref{fig:PM_GMPNP_with_a_2_5}), a few chaotic orbits can be observed in the lower half of the map, which are becoming regular in the PM for $a=0.6$ (Figure \ref{fig:PM_GMPNP_with_a_2_6}). It shows that, for higher values of the Kerr parameter $a$, the degree of chaos is weakly dependent on the rotation parameter. As the changes are very small, a quantitative analysis is required to confirm this correlation, in which case a significantly larger number of initial conditions can be considered and examined.

After finding out the dependence of chaos on the Kerr parameter $a$, we studied the change in the chaotic nature of the orbits with respect to the inclination angle $i$ for both non-relativistic (Figure \ref{fig:PM_nonrel_GMPNP_with_i}) and relativistic (Figure \ref{fig:PM_rel_GMPNP_with_i}) particles. In both cases, the chaotic behaviour of the orbits increases with the angle of inclination $i$. For the non-relativistic orbits with higher inclinations (Figures \ref{fig:PM_nonrel_GMPNP_with_i_4}-\ref{fig:PM_nonrel_GMPNP_with_i_6}), the PM plots change drastically from $i=28^\circ$ to $i=29^\circ$, and from $i=29^\circ$ to $i=30^\circ$. The PM plot for $i=29^\circ$ (Figure \ref{fig:PM_nonrel_GMPNP_with_i_5}) consists of five islands of order, which extinguish in the PM plot for $i=30^\circ$ (Figure \ref{fig:PM_nonrel_GMPNP_with_i_6}), signifying the increase in chaos in the system. In comparison to this, the change of the nature of orbits for smaller inclination angles is more gradual (Figures \ref{fig:PM_nonrel_GMPNP_with_i_1}-\ref{fig:PM_nonrel_GMPNP_with_i_3}\footnote{Here, we have changed the orbital parameters in such a way that the allowable volume of the phase space increases, and the visualisation of PM can be convenient.}). We have already observed the change to be gradual at smaller inclination angles in Figure \ref{fig:PM_with_i_NonRel} and Figure \ref{fig:PM_with_i_Rel} when we studied the PMs corresponding to the off-equatorial orbits around the Schwarzschild-like COPs. This phenomenon will also be corroborated using the quantitative analysis of chaos in the next section. Similar to the non-relativistic case, the chaotic nature of the relativistic orbits has a positive correlation with the inclination angle $i$ (Figures \ref{fig:PM_rel_GMPNP_with_i}). The PM plot for $i=25^\circ$ (Figure \ref{fig:PM_rel_GMPNP_with_i_2}) consists of two clear, stable regions, which get extinguished for the $i=25.2^\circ$ case (Figure \ref{fig:PM_rel_GMPNP_with_i_3}). This analysis tells us that the change in the chaoticity is more drastic at higher inclination angles, even for a small change in the value of inclination. 

\section{Quantification of chaos using Lyapunov exponent} \label{ch:lyapunov}
As we have studied the chaotic dynamics of the orbits qualitatively, we proceed to look for a quantitative way of studying chaos. The quantitative analysis of chaos is an absolute necessity. It can provide a magnified picture of chaos present in a system by considering a large number of initial conditions at once. There are many indicators of chaos available in the literature. We have used the scheme of Lyapunov Exponent in this regard as it is easy to implement, can efficiently distinguish between order and chaos in our system, and is very effective in studying the chaotic correlations over a long range of dynamical parameters. One can measure the exponential divergence of two neighbouring orbits while their starting point is very close to each other \citep{strogatz2007nonlinear}. The number of exponents will equal the number of dimensions of the phase space. However, in the long run (for $t \rightarrow \infty$), the maximum of the exponents dominates. This is known as the Maximum Lyapunov Exponent (MLE) \citep{nag2017influence, de2021beyond}. This can be calculated as
\begin{equation} \label{eq:lpnv_variational}
    \Lambda_{\text{max}} = \lim\limits_{\begin{subarray}{c}
      t \to \infty\\
      ||\xi(0)|| \to 0
      \end{subarray}} \left( \frac{1}{t} \ln \frac{||\xi(t)||}{||\xi(0)||} \right)
\end{equation}
where $||\xi(t)||$ is the norm of the deviation vector of the orbits in the phase space at time $t$. It can be evaluated using the Difference-Hamiltonian and the variational equations \citep{skokos2010numerical}. This method is known as the variational method. Although the method is very accurate, the calculation is intensively rigorous with the potential used in this work (equation \ref{eq:monopole}). As an alternative, we have used the two-particle method, a more convenient and less rigorous way of calculating MLE. 

In the two-particle method, we consider two initial points infinitesimally close to each other. After that, the orbits are made to evolve independently starting from those initial conditions and the norm of the final deviation between the trajectories is measured \citep{de2021beyond}. In this case, the mathematical formula given in equation (\ref{eq:lpnv_variational}) is modified according to the following.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:lpnv_two_particle}
    \Lambda_{\text{max}} = \lim\limits_{\begin{subarray}{c}
      t \to \infty\\
      ||\delta x(0)|| \to 0
      \end{subarray}} \left( \frac{1}{t} \ln \frac{||\delta x(t)||}{||\delta x(0)||} \right)
\end{equation}
where $||\delta x(t)||$ is the norm of the deviation between the two neighbouring orbits in the phase space at time $t$. From the numerical point of view, the mean rate of deviation is calculated using the following formula.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:lpnv_two_particle_mean_rate}
    \Lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{1}{n \tau} \sum_{k=1}^n \ln \frac{||\delta x(k \tau)||}{||\delta x(0)||}
\end{equation}

In order to achieve accurate results, the initial deviation has to be very small, and the precision of the computational instrument has to be high. Furthermore, the orbits diverge very quickly in these methods. According to the definition of MLE, to get legitimate exponents, the deviation $\delta x(t)$ has to remain much within the allowable volume in the phase space. Therefore, we need to re-normalise the deviated orbit after every time step $\tau$ using the Gram-Schmidt renormalisation scheme \citep{tancredi2001comparison}. 

Although the MLEs can be implemented to quantify chaos for individual orbits evolving from particular initial conditions, they still cannot be used as an overall quantitative measure of chaos for a set of parameters. As a solution, we can consider a large number of initial conditions evenly distributed over the allowed phase space and calculate MLEs for each. Thereafter, we can take the average of all the exponents and consider this as a rough quantitative measure of the overall chaotic behaviour of the system for a given set of parameters. In practice, this is known as the Lyapunov Characteristic Number (LCN) of the system. Ideally, as we increase the number of initial conditions, we acquire a more accurate value of LCN. 

In the present work, we have calculated the values of each LCN by taking the average of several MLEs corresponding to different sets of initial conditions. For each set of the initial conditions, the initial deviation has been taken to be $\delta x(0)=10^{-8}$, and the calculation has been carried out for $n=10^5$ iterations with renormalization-time-step $\tau=0.1$. The value of $\Lambda_{\text{max}}$ is smaller than $5 \times 10^{-4}$ for regular orbits and it is more than $5 \times 10^{-4}$ for chaotic orbits.   

By implementing LCN as a quantitative indicator of chaos, we have studied the correlation of chaos with the Kerr parameter $a$ of the COP and the inclination angle $i$ of the orbit. First, let us consider the former (Figure \ref{fig:lcn_with_a}). Looking at the overall trends of LCNs, it is evident that the chaoticity of the system has a negative correlation with the rotation parameter $a$. The inclined orbits are always more chaotic for the maximally counter-rotating COPs, \textit{i.e.}, when the value of $a$ is closer to -1. For lower values of the inclination angle, such as $i=10^\circ$ (Figure \ref{fig:lcn_with_a_1}), the degree of chaos decreases gradually with the increasing value of $a$. For higher angles of inclination, the correlation becomes nuanced. It turns out that the degree of chaos weakly depends on the Kerr parameter $a$ for most of its range. However, the chaoticity rapidly increases below a threshold value of the rotation parameter $a=a_{\text{c}}$. For $i=25^\circ$ (Figure \ref{fig:lcn_with_a_2}), the threshold value is $a_{\text{c}} \approx -0.85$. When the value of $a$ is more than $a_{\text{c}}=-0.85$, the chaoticity decreases very slowly as $a$ increases. But below $a=a_{\text{c}}$, the LCN increases drastically as $a$ decreases. We observed this qualitatively with the PMs in the previous section. The trend in Figure \ref{fig:lcn_with_a_1} corroborates the correlation established with PMs in Figure \ref{fig:PM_GMPNP_with_a_1}. Similarly, the trend in Figure \ref{fig:lcn_with_a_3} agrees with the correlation established in Figure \ref{fig:PM_GMPNP_with_a_2}.

The threshold value of the rotation parameter $a=a_{\text{c}}$ gets affected by the overall chaoticity of the system. Any change in the orbital parameters, which enhances chaoticity in the system, affects it so that the value of $a_{\text{c}}$ increases. For example, for $i=28^\circ$ (Figure \ref{fig:lcn_with_a_3}), the threshold value comes out to be $a_{\text{c}} \approx -0.45$. It is more than $a_{\text{c}} \approx -0.85$, which occurs when the inclination was $i=25^\circ$ (Figure \ref{fig:lcn_with_a_2}). It is happening because the degree of chaos enhances when the inclination angle increases from $i=25^\circ$ to $i=28^\circ$. It seems like the system tries to sustain its stability as long as possible. But, the enhancement of chaoticity makes the system more nonlinear, causing the system to be stable for a shorter span of the Kerr parameter. That is why the threshold value $a=a_{\text{c}}$ increases, and the system retains its stable nature for a shorter range of $a$. When $a<a_{\text{c}}$, the nonlinearity in the system gets triggered, and the LCN shows a sharp upturn as $a$ decreases. We observe a similar phenomenon when we increase energy $E$ and decrease angular momentum $L$ by keeping the inclination angle fixed at $i=25^\circ$ (Figure \ref{fig:lcn_with_a_4}). It causes the overall chaoticity to increase, and the threshold value increases from $a_{\text{c}} \approx -0.85$ to $a_{\text{c}} \approx -0.65$.

On the other hand, the dependence of chaoticity on the inclination angle $i$ is opposite to that for the rotation parameter $a$ (Figure \ref{fig:lcn_with_i}). The degree of chaos increases in the system as the orbits become more inclined with the rotation axis of the COP while keeping the rest of the orbital parameters fixed. It implies that the thicker accretion disks have more chaotic orbits than the thinner ones. However, the change in the LCN is more rapid at the higher values of the inclination angle. This was also observed earlier while studying the chaotic behaviour of the orbits qualitatively using PM plots (Figure \ref{fig:PM_nonrel_GMPNP_with_i}). There is a sudden increase in the values of LCNs at some threshold value of the inclination angle $i=i_{\text{c}}$ (Figure \ref{fig:lcn_with_i}). For $i<i_{\text{c}}$, the chaoticity increases gradually. As the value of $i$ crosses $i_{\text{c}}$, the LCNs start increasing rapidly until it reaches an angle, after which the growth slows down a little, though the positive correlation still holds. This overall trend of LCNs with respect to the inclination angle $i$ is very consistent, and it is true for any given set of orbital parameters. 

Now, if we compare Figure \ref{fig:lcn_with_i_1} and Figure \ref{fig:lcn_with_i_2}, the threshold value has come down from $i_{\text{c}} \approx 21^\circ$ to $i_{\text{c}} \approx 18^\circ$ as the dipole coefficient increases from $\mathcal{D} = 2 \times 10^{-4}$ to $\mathcal{D} = 2.2 \times 10^{-4}$. These results imply that the value of $i_{\text{c}}$ has an anti-correlation with the degree of chaos in the system. As the chaoticity gets enhanced, the nonlinearity in the system increases, and the value of $i_{\text{c}}$ gets lowered. The explanation of stability, in this case, is similar to what we saw while discussing the dependence of chaoticity on the rotation parameter for the higher values of inclination angles. As before, it seems like the system is trying to sustain its stability as long as possible. But the enhancement in the nonlinearity due to any change in the orbital parameters triggers the system early at a lower value of the inclination angle, and the chaoticity starts increasing rapidly. Thus, the value of $i_{\text{c}}$ gets lowered.

\section{Conclusions} \label{ch:conclusion}
In the present work, we have studied the chaotic behaviour of the off-equatorial orbits around a pseudo-Newtonian COP using the generalised force presented in \citet{ghosh2007}. Because of the complex mathematical form of the pseudo-Keplerian force, we have prescribed a numerical method in which a fitting function is used to generate the PNP and implement it in the analysis of orbital dynamics. To incorporate a more realistic scenario, we have introduced an artificial dipolar perturbative term corresponding to an asymmetrically placed hollow halo of matter around the COP. To study the chaotic dynamics of the off-equatorial orbits around the COP, we have implemented the Poincar\'e Maps and Lyapunov Characteristic Numbers as the indicators of chaos. Where Poincar\'e maps help to visualize chaos qualitatively, Lyapunov Characteristic Number quantifies the degree of chaos. 

At first, we studied stable circular orbits and observed how their stability gets affected by the Kerr parameter $a$ and the angle of inclination $i$. We have found that the ISCOs are significantly affected by the Kerr parameter compared to the inclination angle, which has little influence on the radii of ISCOs. Thereafter, we studied the chaotic dynamics of the generic equatorial orbits governed by the GMf PNP and compared them with that governed by the ABN PNP. We saw that for the orbits around the co-rotating COPs, the GMf PNP induces more chaos into the system. For the orbits around the counter-rotating COPs, the effect is the opposite, i.e. the ABN PNP makes the equatorial orbits more chaotic compared to the GMf PNP. The FDE is visible in the case of both the PNPs. 

While studying the correlation of chaos with respect to the rotation parameter $a$, we observed that the chaoticity decreases as the value of $a$ increases. It is maximum for the orbits around the maximally counter-rotating COPs. The degree of chaos for lower values of the inclination angles shows a consistent negative correlation with $a$. Hence, the chaoticity gradually decreases as $a$ increases. However, for higher orbital inclinations, the degree of chaos shows a weak dependence on $a$ at its higher values. Only when $a$ decreases below a threshold value $a_{\text{c}}$, the chaoticity gets dependent on $a$, and it begins to increase rapidly as $a$ gets lowered. The value of $a_{\text{c}}$ has a positive correlation with the degree of chaos present in the system. If the chaoticity gets enhanced because of the change of any orbital parameters, the value of $a_{\text{c}}$ increases.

We have also established that the chaoticity increases as the orbits become more inclined with the equatorial plane. This has been shown for both Schwarzschild and Kerr-like COPs. The Poincar\'e maps reveal that the change in the chaotic nature of the orbits is more rapid at higher inclination angles than the lower ones, in which cases the changes are more gradual. The reason has been explored using the trend in the LCNs. We have observed that the LCNs show a sudden sharp upturn at a particular threshold value of the inclination angle $i=i_{\text{c}}$. For orbits with inclination $i>i_{\text{c}}$, the change in the degree of chaos is more rapid, and for $i<i_{\text{c}}$, the chaoticity changes gradually. Therefore, we can state that for $i>i_{\text{c}}$, even a tiny change in the inclination angle can affect the chaotic behaviour of the orbits significantly. Furthermore, the value of $i_{\text{c}}$ anti-correlates with the nonlinearity in the system. It increases when the overall degree of chaos decreases due to any corresponding change in the orbital parameters. 

In future, we would like to analyze the fitting function, given in equation \ref{eq:GMPNP}, in more depth. It will be interesting to study how the fitting parameters $\{ \gamma_1,...,\gamma_5 \}$ get affected by the rotation parameter $a$ and the inclination angle $i$. The study can lead to a concrete analytical form of the fitting function, converting it into an independent PNP useful for the inclined orbits around COPs. We would also like to perform an in-depth analysis of the dynamics of chaos in the current system using other indicators of chaos, namely the Fast Lyapunov Index or FLI \citep{froeschle1997fast, wang2012dynamics}, Small Alignment Index or SALI \citep{skokos2001alignment, skokos2004detecting}, and General Alignment Index or GALI \citep{skokos2007geometrical}, which are more sensitive to chaos than MLE, making them more efficient to distinguish between order and chaos. We would also like to implement the PNP to study the off-axis motion of a test particle in a restricted three-body system, where the other two bodies are pseudo-Newtonian compact object binaries.

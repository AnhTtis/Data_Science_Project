    \caption{\textbf{Quantitative results of shape reconstruction.} Our method achieves the best results in terms of MPVE, MPJPE and PA-MPJPE. Note that all metrics are measured in a unit $10^{-3}$m.} %P-MPJPE reports the MPJPE error after alignment with 3d keypoint of ground truth in translation and rotation. Theta reports MAE between predition and ground truth. T-rec reports the point-wise MSE between predition and ground truth model with Tpose. Projection error between manual 2D annotation on image and 2D projections of models after alignment

\noindent\textbf{Image Styles.} Fig.~\ref{image_style} shows representative images for the 4 styles with different appearances. We define them based on their different sources: \textit{picture book} - cropped from e-books of children, \textit{computer designed} - made by artists using software, \textit{hand drawn} - drawn by kids, \textit{toy} - captured from real toys.

\noindent\textbf{Shape Modeling Procedure.} We recruit six professional artists to create 3D corresponding character models using Blender according to the collected reference images. The key to building a linear parametric shape model lies in maintaining a unified mesh topology. To achieve this, all six artists are required to craft 3D models by deforming the template mesh under the constraints of the predefined landmarks. Each artist owns over six years of modeling experience and each character takes around 1 hour on average. The modeling result is required to be matched with the reference images as much as possible. To maintain visual quality and topological consistency, we have established a review committee of ten members to assess the models based on reference images and predefined landmarks.

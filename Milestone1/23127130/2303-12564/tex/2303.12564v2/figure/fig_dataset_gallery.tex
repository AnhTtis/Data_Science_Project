  \caption{The \textbf{gallery} of the representative examples sampled from \textit{3DBiCar}. Each collected reference image is followed by the T-pose model and the posed model, created by professional artists. \textit{3DBiCar} contains 1,500 topologically consistent, textured and skinned 3D high-quality models with paired 2D images, which covers 15 species and 4 image styles.
  %Dataset Gallery of \textit{3DBiCar}: Here are 12 examples from all styles of images in \textit{3DBiCar}. Each example is represented by three graphs, a 2D picture, a 3D T-Pose model, and a 3D posed model, respectively, from left to right.

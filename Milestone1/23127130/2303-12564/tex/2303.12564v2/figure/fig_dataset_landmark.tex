  \caption{\textbf{Model checking by body landmarks.} %The model in the middle is the template model with segmented texture. We show the qualified examples (green border) and unqualified examples (red border) for some segmented annotations. The disqualification of the lower left subgraph is because the eyes' label is away from the eye socket, while the disqualification of the lower right subgraph is because the patch represents the elbow is not in the middle of the arm.
  Body landmarks are shown in this template model. Once a new model is finished, we will examine the semantic correspondence by comparing the body landmarks on the new model and the template. Green boxes on top demonstrate the qualified examples. The red box on the left corner is unqualified because this body landmark on the eyes is too large to delineate the eye socket. The other red box on the right corner with the elbow landmark far from the wrist is also unqualified.

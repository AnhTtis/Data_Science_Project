  \caption{We present \textit{\textbf{3DBiCar}}, the first large-scale repository of 3D bipedal cartoon characters manually created by professional artists. It contains 1646 topologically consistent, textured and skinned 3D high-quality models, spanning 17 different species. To fully exploit the power of \textit{3DBiCar}, we propose \textit{SMCL}, a parametric model for mesh, pose and texture generation. With \textit{3DBiCar} and \textit{SMCL}, inferring 3D bipedal character models from a single image becomes possible.}

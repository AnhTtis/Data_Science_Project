	Abstract = {Semiconductor devices have become indispensable for generating electromagnetic radiation in everyday applications. Visible and infrared diode lasers are at the core of information technology, and at the other end of the spectrum, microwave and radio-frequency emitters enable wireless communications. But the terahertz region (1--10 THz; 1 THz = 1012 Hz) between these ranges has remained largely underdeveloped, despite the identification of various possible applications---for example, chemical detection, astronomy and medical imaging1,2,3,4. Progress in this area has been hampered by the lack of compact, low-consumption, solid-state terahertz sources5,6,7,8,9. Here we report a monolithic terahertz injection laser that is based on interminiband transitions in the conduction band of a semiconductor (GaAs/AlGaAs) heterostructure. The prototype demonstrated emits a single mode at 4.4 THz, and already shows high output powers of more than 2 mW with low threshold current densities of about a few hundred A cm-2 up to 50 K. These results are very promising for extending the present laser concept to continuous-wave and high-temperature operation, which would lead to implementation in practical photonic systems.},

	abstract = {Abstract Resonant tunneling diodes (RTDs) are candidates for high power terahertz oscillators, and form the basis for understanding the quantum confinement and vertical transport in quantum structures such as quantum cascade lasers and quantum cascade detectors. In this work, repeatable negative differential resistance (NDR) is achieved in AlN/GaN RTDs grown on sapphire substrate by plasma-assisted molecular-beam epitaxy. Two reproducible NDR regions sequentially following two preresonance replicas are demonstrated at room temperature. A current region exhibiting negative correlation with temperature and oscillation-like features is first identified under reverse bias, which is interpreted as a combined contribution of weak resonant tunneling channels through different bound states in the well. The revealed peak-to-valley current ratio ranges from 1.1 to 1.8, and peak current density ranges from 5 to 164 kA cm−2. Using an analytic model, resonant tunneling transports in both bias directions are quantitatively characterized and show good agreements with experiment results, demonstrating the capability of accurate quantum transport control using III-nitride grown on sapphire substrate. The findings will promote the implementation of low cost III-nitride monolithic microwave circuits and resonant tunneling structures based on sapphire, SiC, and even silicon substrates.},}

It was found that the peak current and the valley current are not sensitive to the change in the doping level of the electrodes. The peak-current voltage and the valley-current voltage, however, increase when the electrode doping level is lowered. These behaviors are explained using the band-bending effect in the electrodes. For devices with lightly doped or undoped electrodes, the quantum size effect in the accumulation layer due to the strong band bending causes additional kinks in the current-voltage characteristics. They are attributed to the resonant tunneling of electrons from the quantized levels in the accumulation layer. The quantum effect also accounts for the improved negative differential resistance behavior."}

	abstract = {Abstract Waveguide designs for AlGaN-based near-infrared quantum cascade lasers are investigated using a finite-difference method mode solver. Because of the negligibly small refractive index difference between the AlN/GaN/AlGaN gain region and the surrounding AlGaN current injection and extraction layers, a low refractive index substrate (sapphire) and a low refractive index dielectric (SiO2) are used for vertical confinement of the optical field. A ridge waveguide with an off-center contact metallization is used for lateral confinement. The off-center contact allows for the propagation of a TM mode with low metal induced loss and sufficient optical confinement in the gain region. A viable waveguide design with a metal-induced loss of 6.1 cm-1 and a confinement factor of 0.52 is demonstrated. (© 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim)},

The wave packet localizes in a quantum well for a finite lifetime. The lifetime is related to the energy width of the resonant level due to the uncertainty principle, and is inversely proportional to the tunneling probability of the funnet barrier. When barriers of the quantum well are asymmetric, the lifetime is determined by the barrier that has the higher tunneling probability.}}

For high-frequency oscillation of RTDs, the electron delay time, which is composed of the dwell time in the resonance region and the transit time in the collector depletion region, must be reduced. Although the transit time is reduced by a thin collector spacer, the capacitance increases. Thus, an optimum thickness of collector spacer layer exists. In this report, we investigate the dependence of oscillation frequency on the collector spacer thickness. The RTDs were integrated with 20-$\mu$m-long slot antennas, and oscillations up to 1.1, 1.42, and 1.29 THz were obtained for spacer thicknesses of 25, 12, and 6 nm, respectively. The optimum spacer thickness for high-frequency oscillation was around 12 nm. The highest frequency in this experiment was 1.42 THz oscillation, with an output power of {\textasciitilde}1 $\mu$W. We also extracted the electron velocity in the collector depletion region and the dwell time from the dependence of the delay time on the collector spacer thickness.",

The intrinsic delay time is composed of the electron dwell time in the resonant tunneling region and the electron transit time in the collector depletion region. We obtain and discuss the structure dependence of these factors in terms of the oscillation frequency and output power measured for RTD oscillators with different quantum-well and collector-spacer thicknesses and different air-bridge widths between the RTD and a slot antenna. The highest oscillation frequency achieved in this experiment is 1.86 THz for the well and spacer thicknesses of 2.5 and 12 nm, respectively, with a 1-µm-wide air bridge. In this structure, the extrinsic delay time (80 fs) estimated from the parasitic elements is more than double the intrinsic delay time (35 fs). It is shown theoretically that an oscillation frequency of over 2 THz is possible upon the reduction in the extrinsic delay time caused by the bulk and spread resistances in RTDs.}}

The steps consist of coupled quantum wells in which population inversion between discrete conduction band excited states is achieved by control of tunneling. A strong narrowing of the emission spectrum, above threshold, provides direct evidence of laser action at a wavelength of 4.2 micrometers with peak powers in excess of 8 milliwatts in pulsed operation. In quantum cascade lasers, the wavelength, entirely determined by quantum confinement, can be tailored from the mid-infrared to the submillimeter wave region in the same heterostructure material.},

	Abstract = {The bistability characteristics of GaN/AlN resonant tunneling diodes (RTDs) grown on a sapphire substrate by metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) were investigated to better understand their physical origin and explore their use in nonvolatile memories. The bistability current--voltage ( I -- V ) characteristics of GaN/AlN RTDs, which were due to intersubband transitions and electron accumulation in the quantum well, were clearly observed over a wide temperature range between 50 and 300 K. However, the I -- V characteristics sometimes degraded at temperatures above 250 K. Complex staircase structures were observed in the voltage region showing a negative differential resistance in the I -- V curve, and the forward current increased or decreased rapidly as the forward-bias voltage increased. Repeated measurements of the I -- V characteristics over the wide temperature range between 50 and 300 K revealed that the bistability characteristics of GaN/AlN RTDs degraded owing to the leakage of electrons accumulating in the quantum well through a deep level in the AlN barrier associated with crystal defects such as dislocations and impurities. Therefore, reduction in crystal defect and impurity densities in the AlN barrier, and a careful design that considers deep levels are important for realizing realize ultrafast nonvolatile memories based on the bistability characteristics of GaN/AlN RTDs.},

We demonstrate high-efficiency p-type doping by ionizing acceptor dopants using the built-in electronic polarization in bulk uniaxial semiconductor crystals. Because the mobile hole gases are field-ionized, they are robust to thermal freezeout effects and lead to major improvements in p-type electrical conductivity. The new doping technique results in improved optical emission efficiency in prototype ultraviolet light-emitting{\textendash}diode structures. Polarization-induced doping provides an attractive solution to both p- and n-type doping problems in wide{\textendash}band-gap semiconductors and offers an unconventional path for the development of solid-state deep-ultraviolet optoelectronic devices and wide{\textendash}band-gap bipolar electronic devices of the future.},

	abstract="Electrical conductance is typically calculated by approaches which view the electrical field as a causative source and the motion of carriers as a response. An alternative viewpoint, which starts from the flux of carriers maintained at the edges of a sample, and then calculates how charges build up and fields develop, has gained acceptance in the treatment of disordered systems, the solid state Aharanov-Bohm effect, and universal fluctuations. We analyze some of the less appreciated concomitants of this viewpoint, emphasizing both the generality and limitations of the viewpoint. Particular emphasis is given to the Residual Resistivity Dipole; localized scatterers in metallic conductivity are accompanied by highly localized transport fields. Closed Hamiltonian systems, e.g. a metallic ring with elastic scattering and driven by a time-dependent magnetic flux, are conservative. They cannot exhibit dissipation, under our conventionally accepted forms of physics. It is suggested that the limited precision available,in principle, in calculating the behavior of physical systems limits our ability to retrieve energy from supposedly conservative systems. This can be regarded as the ultimate source of dissipative processes.",

	abstract={It is pointed out that sequential tunneling has, until now, been defined in two ways in the literature, and this has led to some confusion. It is shown that sequential tunneling defined as a two-step process is an alternative description of resonant tunneling, but not an alternative mechanism for it.}}

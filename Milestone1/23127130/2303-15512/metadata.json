    "abstract": "The event horizon of a dynamical black hole is generically a non-smooth hypersurface. We classify the types of non-smooth structure that can arise on a horizon that is smooth at late time. The classification includes creases, corners and caustic points. We prove that creases and corners form spacelike submanifolds of dimension $2,1$ and that caustic points form a set of dimension at most $1$. We classify \"perestroikas\" of these structures, in which they undergo a qualitative change at an instant of time. A crease perestroika gives an exact local description of the event horizon near the \"instant of merger\" of a generic black hole merger. Other crease perestroikas describe horizon nucleation or collapse of a hole in a toroidal horizon. Caustic perestroikas, in which a pair of caustic points either nucleate or annihilate, provide a mechanism for creases to decay. We argue that properties of quantum entanglement entropy suggest that creases might contribute to black hole entropy. We explain that a \"Gauss-Bonnet\" term in the entropy is non-topological on a non-smooth horizon, which invalidates previous arguments against such a term.",

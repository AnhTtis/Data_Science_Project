    "abstract": "Matrix sensing has many real-world applications in science and engineering, such as system control, distance embedding, and computer vision. The goal of matrix sensing is to recover a matrix $A_\\star \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$, based on a sequence of measurements $(u_i,b_i) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\times \\mathbb{R}$ such that $u_i^\\top A_\\star u_i = b_i$. Previous work [ZJD15] focused on the scenario where matrix $A_{\\star}$ has a small rank, e.g. rank-$k$. Their analysis heavily relies on the RIP assumption, making it unclear how to generalize to high-rank matrices. In this paper, we relax that rank-$k$ assumption and solve a much more general matrix sensing problem. Given an accuracy parameter $δ\\in (0,1)$, we can compute $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ in $\\widetilde{O}(m^{3/2} n^2 δ^{-1} )$, such that $ |u_i^\\top A u_i - b_i| \\leq δ$ for all $i \\in [m]$. We design an efficient algorithm with provable convergence guarantees using stochastic gradient descent for this problem.",

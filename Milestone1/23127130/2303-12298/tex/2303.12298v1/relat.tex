\paragraph{Linear Progamming}
Linear programming is one of foundations of the algorithm design and convex optimization. many problems can be modeled as linear programs to take advantage of fast algorithms.
There are many works in accelerating linear programming runtime complexity~\citep{ls14, ls15, cls19, lsz19, b20, blss20, sy21, dly21, jswz21,gs22}.

\paragraph{Semi-definite Programming}

 
Semidefinite programming optimizes a linear objective function over the intersection of the
positive semidefinite cone with an affine space. Semidefinite programming is a fundamental class of
optimization problems and many problems in machine learning, and theoretical computer science
can be modeled or approximated as semidefinite programming problems. There are many studies to speedup the running
time of Semidefinite programming~\citep{nn94, hrvw96, lsw15, jlsw20, jklps20, hjstz21, gs22}.

\paragraph{Matrix Sensing}

Matrix sensing~\citep{lb09, rfp10, jmd10, zjd15, dls23} is a generalization of the popular compressive sensing problem for the sparse vectors and has applications in several
domains such as control, vision etc.
a set of universal Pauli measurements,
used in quantum state tomography, have been shown to satisfy the RIP condition~\citep{l11}.
These measurement operators are Kronecker products of $2 \times 2$ matrices, thus, they have appealing computation and memory efficiency. Rank-one measurement using nuclear norm minimization is also used in other work~\citep{cz15, krt17}.
There is also previous work working on low-rank matrix sensing to reconstruct a matrix exactly using a small number of linear measurements.
ProcrustesFlow~\cite{tbssr16} designs an algorithm to recover a low-rank matrix from linear measurements.
There are other low-rank matrix recovering algorithms based on non-convex optimizations~\cite{ wzg17, lmcc19}.

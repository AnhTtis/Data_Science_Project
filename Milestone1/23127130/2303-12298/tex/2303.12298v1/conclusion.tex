In this paper, we study the problem of matrix sensing which has a wide variety of practical applications in real-world science and engineering problems like image processing, quantum computing, and sensor localization. In many application domains of matrix sensing, it is appealing to tradeoff accuracy for fast running time, e.g., in fast and approximated $k$-nearest neighbors and $k$-means.
We design an efficient algorithm with provable convergence guarantees using stochastic gradient descent to approximate matrix sensing.

\begin{abstract}

\textbf{Abstract:} Achieving strong interactions between distinct systems over macroscopic distances is important for constructing quantum or neural networks, but in conventional wisdom strong coupling is routinely achieved in close proximity. Recently, cascaded strong coupling under laser mediation breaks this scenario, but directly forming long-range strong coupling through radiation channels remains challenging because of the severe decay of the interaction with spatial distance. In light of the emerging gain-driven polartion, here we show that this paradigm can be breached if the system damping is compensated by a gain. Consequently, a meter-scale-strong photon-magnon coupling at room temperature is experimentally realized. With full access to traveling waves, we remotely control photon-magnon coupling by modulating the phases and amplitudes of traveling waves, rather than reconfiguring subsystems themselves following conventional wisdom. Our method for realizing one-meter range strong interactions in cavity magnonics may provide a general idea for other physical entities. The experimental achievements in our work may promote the construction of information networks based on cavity magnonics.

\maketitle

Many recent advances in quantum science and information technology have benefited from engineering strong, steerable interactions between quantum systems \cite{pezze2018quantum,gross2017quantum,kimble2008quantum,tabuchi2015coherent,lachance2020entanglement}. In these hybrid systems, strong coupling between subsystems routinely forms in close proximity, for instance the formation of polaritons in quantum wells \cite{gibbs2011exciton}, strong photon-atom coupling in cavities \cite{mabuchi2002cavity}, optical modes interactions in microcavities \cite{scully1999quantum}. All these systems are delicately designed at centimeter or even nanometer sizes to enhance the coupling strength between subsystems. Nowadays with the emerging trend of quantum network and long-range quantum entanglement, the community has raised high demands for information transfer over long distances as kilometer scale. Aiming at this goal, it's crucial to lift the limitation of near-field interaction and extend the coupling range far beyond wavelength \cite{richerme2014non,landig2016quantum,mottl2012roton,PRXQuantum2040314,wang2022giant, gopalakrishnan2009emergent,maghrebi2017continuous,hofmann2012heralded}. The central quest is to find an efficient way for transmitting bidirectional interactions between subsystems in the far field. For instance, when using a free-space laser beam, the strong coupling is achieved between a mechanical oscillator and atomic spins that are 1 meter apart \cite{karg2020light}. 


Among all possible methods, the most straightforward and simplest one is to use the traveling waves to convey interactions between separate systems \cite{van2013photon,hsu2016bound}. Such indirect coupling attracts attention because of its advantages in engineering abnormal dispersion and harnessing loss. Although increasing the radiation rates of subsystems can improve their coupling strength, their dissipation will increase in step with the radiation in conventional wisdom. This constraint hinders the cooperativity of subsystems from surpassing unity \cite{SM} as sketched in Fig. \ref{Fig1} (a), thereby impeding the possibility of achieving strong coupling via this approach. As a consequence, both coherent and dissipative couplings face the challenge of limited extension over long distances when approaching the strong coupling regime. To lift this limitation, it is necessary to solve the dilemma between increasing radiation and suppressing dissipation, thus providing solutions for remote strong coupling system with interaction distance orders of magnitude larger than wavelength, even to meter-scale.

Following this strategy, we design a gain-driven polariton (GDP) system \cite{08904} and demonstrate the meter-scale strong coupling between microwave photons in an active cavity and magnons in a ferrimagnetic crystal. The active cavity is fully described by the Van der Pol mechanism \cite{van1926,dutta2019critical,lorch2016genuine}, which widely exists in nearly all self-sustained systems, such as heartbeats \cite{van1928lxxii}, semiconductor lasers \cite{uemukai2000tunable} and trapped ions 
 \cite{leibfried2003quantum}. The core mechanism is a saturable gain that adaptively compensates for the system damping, thus making the system self-sustained. In addition, the emerging cavity magnonics \cite{rameshti2022cavity,zhang2014strongly,huebl2013high,goryachev2014high,zhang2015magnon,wang2019nonreciprocity,wang2021magnonic} combines the complementary merits of cavity photons and collective spin excitations (i.e., magnons), which connects cavity quantum electrodynamics with magnetism. The GDP formed by the coupling of active cavity and intracavity magnons has shown the remarkable enhancement of polariton coherence and photon emission \cite{08904}, but applying it to spatially separated photon-magnon coupling remains a challenge. In this work, we use the GDP mechanism to realize the long-range photon-magnon coupling. Because of a saturable gain, the hybrid photon-magnon state becomes stable with time and permanently preserves its phase correlation.  This gain enhances the cooperativity of photon-magnon coupling, and hence enables the long-range strong photon-magnon coupling for both coherent and dissipative dynamics. Our work demonstrates a handy method for manipulating the strong coupling between distinct systems beyond the near-field regime. This method may allow for constructing networks based on cavity magnonics for information processing tasks. 

Figure \ref{Fig1} (b) depicts our assembly for studying the long-range strong photon-magnon coupling. Microwave photons in a cavity couple to magnons in a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere via traveling waves in a long coaxial cable. A low-noise transistor is embedded in the cavity (Fig. \ref{Fig1} (c)). The dynamic properties of the cavity are governed by a Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}_a$ \cite{SM,gilles1993two,lee2013quantum}, which includes a saturable gain $-N\left[1-i\sqrt{\varepsilon/2}\hat{a}-\varepsilon|\hat{a}|^2\right]$; where $\hat{a}$, $N$ and $\varepsilon$ represent the photon operator, linear negative damping and saturation factor of the cavity mode, respectively. Because of the energy compensation from this saturable gain, the cavity mode is self-sustained. From the transmission spectra (Figs. \ref{Fig1} (d) and (e)), we see that the broad cavity resonance becomes an ultrasharp peak with an effective quality factor of $2.8\times10^4$ after turning on the transistor. To avoid perturbing the sensitive cavity mode, the probe signal is set to -50 dBm. The cavity mode frequency and its intrinsic damping extracted from curve fitting are $\omega_c/2\pi=3.82$~GHz and $\beta/2\pi=85.4$ MHz, respectively. The YIG sphere is mounted on a coplanar waveguide (CPW), and then connected to the cavity via a coaxial cable ($\sim1$ m) to produce the long-range strong photon-magnon coupling. The magnon mode in the sphere is modeled by a Hamiltonian of $\mathcal{H}_m=\hbar (\omega_m-i\alpha)\hat{m}^{\dagger} \hat{m}$, where $\hat{m}$ ($\hat{m}^{\dagger}$) is the annihilation (creation) magnon operator, $\alpha$ is the magnon damping rate, and $\omega_m$ is the magnon mode frequency, which is precisely controlled by an external magnetic field.

\end{center}
\end{figure}

Traveling waves propagating in the coaxial cable mediate the indirect photon-magnon coupling \cite{rao2020interactions}. The magnon mode dissipates energy into traveling waves and eventually converts to a perturbation on the cavity mode with a strength of $\sqrt{\kappa\gamma}e^{i\varphi}$, where $\varphi$ is the propagation phase of traveling waves between two separated modes, $\kappa/2\pi\approx18.7$ MHz (fitted from Fig. \ref{Fig1} (c)) and $\gamma$ (varied in the \textit{rf}-field \cite{yang2018influence}) are the radiation rates of two modes into traveling waves, respectively. Conversely, the perturbation on the magnon mode exerted by the cavity mode has a strength of $-\sqrt{\kappa\gamma}e^{i\varphi}$. This indirect coupling effect is a combination of coherent coupling $J=-\sqrt{\kappa\gamma}\sin\varphi$ and the dissipative coupling $i\Gamma=i\sqrt{\kappa\gamma}\cos\varphi$. By tuning $\varphi$, the proportions of these two coupling mechanisms are precisely controlled. 

The saturable gain compensates the cavity mode damping rate to zero, but doesn't reduce the indirect photon-magnon coupling strength. This is the prerequisite for achieving the long-range strong photon-magnon coupling. Moreover, the coupling strength must exceed the overall damping rate of the magnon mode $\alpha'=\alpha+\gamma e^{i2\varphi}$. Therefore, the criteria for strong photon-magnon coupling become $\sqrt{\kappa\gamma}>\alpha'$, particularly $|J|>\alpha'$ and $|\Gamma|>\alpha'$ respectively for the coherent and dissipative coupling cases. By focusing on this goal, our experiment is designed in two steps: (i) preparing the strong coupling in the near-field regime, (ii) further pushing the distance limit of strong coupling to meter scale by manipulating traveling waves. 

First, we place the YIG sphere at the position A (Fig. \ref{Fig1} (c)), where the magnetic field of the cavity is at its maximum. The direct overlap of the cavity and magnon modes produces a strong coherent coupling with a strength $g$ ($g\in\mathbb{R}$). At position A, magnon mode coupling to the traveling waves is negligible compared to the coupling to the cavity mode, thereby such purely coherent coupling is modeled as $\mathcal{H}_c=\hbar g(\hat{a}^{\dagger}+\hat{a})(\hat{m}^{\dagger}+\hat{m})$. By sweeping the detuning ($\Delta=\omega_m-\omega_c$) up and down, the transmission spectra of the system are collected, as shown in Fig. \ref{Fig2} (a) and (b). In addition to weak side-band modes, the system possesses a dominant mode (bright yellow color). With different sweeping histories, the dominant mode exhibits a bistable behavior. Two frequency jumps occur at $\Delta_u/2\pi=29.5$~MHz in Fig. \ref{Fig2}(a) and $\Delta_d/2\pi=-23.6$~MHz in Fig. \ref{Fig2}(b), which are almost symmetrically with respect to the zero detuning ($\Delta=0$).

The dominant resonant peak is called GDP mode. It can be explained as follows: the self-sustained cavity mode causes the spins to precess with a constant phase delay, while at the same time, the spin precession generates a variation in susceptibility that affects the cavity field and causes a shift in the cavity oscillation frequency. Such a synchronization process is governed by the dynamic equations derived from system's Hamiltonian. After reaching the steady state, both the photon and magnon modes oscillate at the same frequency $\omega_s$ with a constant phase difference $\theta$. Their oscillations are written as $\hat{a}=|\hat{a}|e^{-i\omega_st}$ and $\hat{m}=|\hat{m}|e^{-i(\omega_st+\theta)}$. By substituting them into dynamic equations, we obtain
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
&(g\cos\theta-J\sin\theta)[\frac{|\hat{m}|}{|\hat{a}|}-\frac{|\hat{a}|}{|\hat{m}|}]+\Gamma\cos\theta[\frac{|\hat{m}|}{|\hat{a}|}+\frac{|\hat{a}|}{|\hat{m}|}]=\Delta \label{R_P}, \\
&\omega_s=\omega_c+[(g+\Gamma)\cos\theta-J\sin\theta]\frac{|\hat{m}|}{|\hat{a}|} \label{VdP_Mode},
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $|\hat{m}|/|\hat{a}|=\left[(g-\Gamma)\sin\theta+J\cos\theta\right]/\alpha'$ and $\theta\in\left(\arctan(-\frac{J}{g-\Gamma}),\quad\arctan(-\frac{J}{g-\Gamma})+\pi\right)$. The GDP mode frequency $\omega_s$ is solely determined by the detuning ($\Delta$), coupling strength ($g$, $J+i\Gamma$) and magnon damping ($\alpha'$).



The frequencies of the GDP mode extracted from Figs. \ref{Fig2} (a) and (b) are plotted in Fig. \ref{Fig2} (c). A clockwise hysteresis loop is formed between $\Delta_d$ and $\Delta_u$. Because of the decoupling between the magnon mode and traveling waves, $J$ and $\Gamma$ are zero. $g/2\pi$ and $\alpha'/2\pi$ as $11$ MHz and $1.8$ MHz are fitted from the measured GDP mode frequencies in Fig. \ref{Fig2} (c) by using Eq. (\ref{VdP_Mode}). Because $g>\alpha'$, the system unambiguously demonstrates the strong photon-magnon coupling. The calculated $\theta$ is an S-shape function of the detuning (Fig. \ref{Fig2} (d)). Between $\Delta_d$ and $\Delta_u$, $\theta$ has three analytical solutions, including an unstable solution indicated by a  dashed  line. At $\Delta_d$ and $\Delta_u$, $\theta$ reaches its value boundaries and exhibits abrupt jumps\cite{pippard2007physics}.

(\ref{R_P}).}\label{DissCoup}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

To achieve strongly dissipative photon-magnon coupling, we have to use the mediation of traveling waves. For this purpose, we place the YIG sphere near the output stripline of the cavity (Fig. \ref{DissCoup} (a)), so that the travelling waves in the output stripline mediate the interaction between cavity photons and magnons. In this configuration, the direct coherent coupling $g$ is suppressed while the indirect dissipative coupling is produced. Distinct from the coherent coupling case, the bistability of the GDP mode disappears, as shown in Fig. \ref{DissCoup} (b); nevertheless, a level attraction with the coalescence of hybridized photon-magnon modes occurs instead \cite{rao2021interferometric,grigoryan2018synchronized,yu2019prediction,bhoi2019abnormal,boventer2019steering,harder2018level}. As a typical representative of dissipative photon-magnon coupling, level attraction has shown potential in topological information transfer and mode synchronization. Yet it is considered to be inaccessible to the strongly coupling regime because of the dominant dissipative dynamics. In our case, with reproducing the dispersion trace (blue circles in Fig. \ref{DissCoup} (c)), $g/2\pi=0$MHz, $\Gamma/2\pi=6.1$ MHz and $\alpha'/2\pi=3$ MHz can be obtained. The magnon mode damping is enhanced by the additional radiation into traveling waves and verified by far-detuned curve fitting \cite{SM}. Nonetheless, the dissipative coupling strength still exceeds magnon damping ($\Gamma>\alpha'$), unambiguously demonstrating that the system enters the strong dissipative coupling regime. In addition, $\theta$ calculated from Eq. (\ref{R_P}) reduces from an S-shape function to a monotonic function (see Fig. \ref{DissCoup} (d)), causing the bistability to disappear.

(\ref{VdP_Mode}).}\label{remote}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

By moving the YIG sphere further along the output microstrip line of the cavity, the propagation phase of traveling waves $\varphi$ can be precisely tuned. As a result, the indirect photon-magnon coupling becomes a combination of coherent and dissipative couplings with a strength $J+i\Gamma$. This effect has been verified in experiment, and can be well explained by Eq. (\ref{VdP_Mode}) \cite{SM}. It demonstrates the feasibility of achieving long-range photon-magnon coupling by utilizing traveling waves as a mediator. 

Following this idea, we then extend the spatial distance between the cavity and the YIG sphere to the meter scale (Fig. \ref{Fig1} (a)) via a coaxial cable ($\sim 1$ m). With full access to traveling waves, we can control the strong photon-magnon coupling without modifying the two subsystems. The voltage-controlled attenuator and the mechanical phase shifter modulate the transmission coefficient ($\sigma$) and the propagation phase ($\varphi$) of traveling waves, respectively. First, we slightly tune the phase shifter to form purely coherent photon-magnon coupling. When the bias voltage on the attenuator is $0.2$~V, its transmission $\sigma$ is almost 0 dB. The coherent coupling strength and the magnon damping fitted from GDP mode frequencies are $|J|/2\pi=7.1$ MHz and $\alpha'/2\pi=1.3$ MHz, respectively, satisfying the criterion $|J|>\alpha'$ for strong coherent coupling. As the attenuator is tuned to further inhibit the transmission coefficient $\sigma$, the coherent coupling strength ($|J|$) subsequently linearly decays (Fig. \ref{remote} (a)). The strong coupling status can be even achieved with decreasing $\sigma$ to 0.35. Considering that the attenuation of the coaxial cable used in our experiment is 0.56 dB/m, the longest distance for strongly coherent photon-magnon coupling is equivalently estimated at 17.3~m. The strength almost decreases to zero at $\sigma$ = 0, corresponding to photon-magnon decoupling when the cable transmission is shut off. Two typical measurement results with $\sigma=1$ and $0.63$ are plotted in Fig. \ref{remote} (b) and (c), from which both the coupling gap and the bistability range shrink with decreasing $|J|$. 


Then, we adjust the phases of traveling waves by $\pi/2$ by tuning the phase shifter. Consequently, photon-magnon coupling is switched to be purely dissipative. With increasing attenuation, the dissipative coupling strength ($|\Gamma|$) linearly decreases (Fig. \ref{remote} (d)), similar to the aforementioned coherent coupling case. When $\sigma=1$, the dissipative coupling strength ($|\Gamma|/2\pi$) and the magnon damping ($\alpha'/2\pi$) are fitted as 7.4 MHz and 6.2 MHz, respectively. It still meets the criterion of $|\Gamma|>\alpha'$. Hence, strong dissipative photon-magnon coupling over meter scale is demonstrated. Two typical measurements are plotted in Fig. \ref{remote} (e) and (f). We note that the increase of magnon damping in the dissipative coupling hinders the cooperativity, and the equivalent strong coupling distance estimated is 7.6~m. From Fig. \ref{remote} (e) to (f), the detuning interval of mode coalescence narrows and Fig. \ref{remote} (f) has dropped out of the strong coupling regime.


Our results conclusively demonstrate two distinct kinds of strong photon-magnon coupling effects, namely the coherent and dissipative photon-magnon coupling, which can be extended beyond the near-field limitation. By using a saturable gain to compensate for the cavity damping rate, our system maintains a large indirect photon-magnon coupling strength over the meter scale and eliminate the intense decoherence from the cavity dissipation. Different from previous studies which tuning the photon-magnon coupling strength by spin number, cavity mode volume, or mode overlap coefficient, we introduce a new method for controlling photon-magnon coupling by manipulating their common radiative mediums, i.e., traveling waves. By tuning the propagation phase of traveling waves, the switch between strong coherent and dissipative photon-magnon coupling is realized. By tuning the transmission coefficient of traveling waves, we develop a high-dimensional control of photon-magnon coupling that goes beyond manipulating the subsystems themselves. 

This work demonstrate a flexible and harnessable solution for significantly extending the light-matter coupling distance. It is reasonable to believe that the coupling distance can be further enhanced by amplifying traveling waves in a bidirectional manner, thus providing further opportunities for large-scale quantum network and communication experiments and allowing magnons to exchange, access, and feed back information directly between separated and physically distinct systems under a network architecture. Magnonic functionalities, such as long-lived memories\cite{zhang2015magnon}, nonreciprocal transmission\cite{wang2019nonreciprocity}, logic operations\cite{rao2019analogue} and energy accumulation\cite{yu2020magnon}, which originally demonstrated in a single device, are expected to be integrated by combining their features in a reconfigurable manner through scalable networks. In summary, our results demonstrate a generalized method for achieving long-range strong coupling and promise new approaches for information processing in cavity magnonic networks.

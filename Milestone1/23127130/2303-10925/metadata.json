    "abstract": "Achieving strong interactions between distinct systems over macroscopic distances is important for constructing quantum or neural networks, but in conventional wisdom strong coupling is routinely achieved in close proximity. Recently, cascaded strong coupling under laser mediation breaks this scenario, but directly forming long-range strong coupling through radiation channels remains challenging because of the severe decay of the interaction with spatial distance. In light of the emerging gain-driven polartion, here we show that this paradigm can be breached if the system damping is compensated by a gain. Consequently, a meter-scale-strong photon-magnon coupling at room temperature is experimentally realized. With full access to traveling waves, we remotely control photon-magnon coupling by modulating the phases and amplitudes of traveling waves, rather than reconfiguring subsystems themselves following conventional wisdom. Our method for realizing one-meter range strong interactions in cavity magnonics may provide a general idea for other physical entities. The experimental achievements in our work may promote the construction of information networks based on cavity magnonics.",

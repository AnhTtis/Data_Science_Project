\section{Conclusion}
In the NVS task of unbounded scenes, previous NeRF methods mainly rely on the NDC warping or the inverse sphere warping to process the forward-facing camera trajectory or the 360$^\circ$ object-centric trajectory. 
In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the space warping function and propose a novel perspective warping, which is able to handle arbitrary input camera trajectories. Based on the perspective warping, we develop a novel \ourmethod in the grid-based NeRF framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed \ourmethod is able to render high-quality images with arbitrary trajectories while only requiring a few minutes of training time.

\noindent {\bf Potential negative societal impact.} 
\ourmethod can be possibly used for misleading fake image generation.

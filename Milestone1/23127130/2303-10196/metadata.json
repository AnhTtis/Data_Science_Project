    "abstract": "We investigate stochastic entropy production in a two-level quantum system that performs Rabi oscillations while undergoing quantum measurement brought about by continuous random disturbance by an external measuring device or environment. The dynamics produce quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effects for certain measurement regimes, and the stochastic entropy production is a measure of the irreversibility of the behaviour. When the strength of the measurement disturbance is time-dependent, the stochastic entropy production separates into three components. Two represent relaxational behaviour, one being specific to systems represented by coordinates that are odd under time reversal symmetry, and a third characterises the nonequilibrium stationary state arising from breakage of detailed balance in the dynamics. The study illustrates how the ideas of stochastic thermodynamics may be applied in similar ways to both quantum and classical systems.",

    \caption{ Baseline model architecture. Patches are inputted to Inception-Net for feature extraction. Final 2 layers are fully connected  classifier layers. Outputs are propagated to a softmax layer for probabilities. N is number of patient patches, $P_i$ are patches MSI probabilities. $P_w$, MSI score for each patient is average over its MSI probabilities (a). Biologically-primed model architecture. As in the baseline, the softmax layer output classes probabilities in patch-level. The MSI probability is the max between $MSI_1$ and $MSI_2$ outputs. $P_w$ same as in baseline (b).}

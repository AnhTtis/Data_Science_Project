    \caption{Combined model architecture. Models A and B are biologically-primed models based on 2 different biological features. Network output from trained and fixed model A and model B is concatenated and inserted to a linear layer. Outputs are propagated to a softmax layer for probabilities. N is number of patient patches, $P_i$ are patches MSI probabilities. $P_w$, MSI score for each patient is average over its MSI probabilities. This figure uses code from D. Stutz repo \cite{latex-repo}. }

\caption{Entire cohort of TCGA COAD and READ datasets is n=632. Kather et al. pre-processed and published part of the data, n=360. They split the patients to training (n=260) and testing (n=100) sets. The training set was balanced on patch level. In our work we used stratified folds at the patient level for cross-validation. The folds were determined by the new sub-labels. }

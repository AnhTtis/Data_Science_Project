    \caption{Patch level boxplot of methylation type. The columns are the baseline model classified results on the test set. True MSI are patches that were correctly classified to MSI, False MSS are MSI patches that were mistakenly classified to MSS. The y-axis is number of patients with the corresponding methylation type. Each methylation type is normalized by the column size}

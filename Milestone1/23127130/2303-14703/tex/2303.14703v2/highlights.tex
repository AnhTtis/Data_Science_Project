\section*{Highlights}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Revealing the correlation between CRC subtypes genomic variations such as SNP and CIMP and cellular morphology expressed by H\&E imaging phenotype.  
    \item Introducing CNN models for CRC subtype classification that consider the potential correlation between CRC subtype genomic heterogeneity and cellular morphology as expressed by H\&E imaging phenotype.
    \item Improved accuracy for CNN-based CRC subtype classification 
    
\end{itemize}

    "abstract": "Recent works have made strong efforts to produce standardised photometry in RGB bands. For this purpose, we carefully defined the transmissivity curves of RGB bands and defined a set of standard sources using the photometric information present in Gaia EDR3. This work aims not only to significantly increase the number and accuracy of RGB standards but also to provide, for the first time, reliable uncertainty estimates using the BP and RP spectrophotometry published in Gaia DR3 instead of their integrated photometry to predict RGB photometry. Furthermore, this method allows including calibrated sources regardless of how they are affected by extinction, which was a major shortcoming of previous work. The RGB photometry is synthesised from the Gaia BP and RP low-resolution spectra by directly using their set of coefficients multiplied with some basis functions provided in the Gaia catalogue for all sources published in Gaia DR3. The output synthetic magnitudes are compared with the previous catalogue of RGB standards available.",

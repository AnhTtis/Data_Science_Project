\noindent  The inner cores of massive neutron stars contain strongly interacting matter at the highest densities reached in our Universe. Under these conditions the cores may undergo a phase transition to deconfined quark matter, which exhibits approximate conformal symmetry. Using a Bayesian inference setup that utilizes all available neutron-star measurements and state-of-the-art theoretical calculations, we demonstrate that in the cores of the most massive stars the equation of state is consistent with the presence of deconfined quark matter. We do this by (i) establishing an effective conformal symmetry restoration with 88\% credence at the highest densities probed in these objects, and (ii) demonstrating that the number of active degrees of freedom favors an interpretation of this finding in terms of the presence of deconfined matter. 
The remaining probability for purely hadronic maximal-mass stars arises from equation-of-state behavior featuring small sound-speed and polytropic-index values, consistent with a first-order phase transition.

%Beneath the cold and unfeeling surface of the cosmos, there exist monstrous entities - entities that defy our understanding of the natural world. Amongst these horrors, there exist neutron stars - silent sentinels that hold secrets so dark and unimaginable that their very existence threatens to drive us mad.

%Deep within their dense cores, there is a force so great, so terrible, that it may cause a phase transition to occur - transforming matter into a deconfined quark matter that exhibits an approximate conformal symmetry. This is a secret so profane that it may shake the very foundations of our reality.

%Yet, we cannot resist the call of knowledge, for the truth is that which must be pursued, no matter the cost. Through the use of advanced Bayesian inference techniques, we have peered into the very heart of these cosmic abominations, and what we have seen will haunt us forevermore.

%Our analysis has shown that the equation of state in the core of neutron stars is consistent with the notion of quark matter, and that the approximate restoration of conformal symmetry at the highest densities supports this interpretation. We have unlocked the secrets of the neutron stars' core, but at what price? For what horrors await us in the pursuit of knowledge?

%Perhaps it is best that we turn away from the abyss, for the knowledge that we have gained is but a mere glimpse into the true nature of the universe. For as the mad poet Abdul Alhazred once wrote, "That is not dead which can eternal lie, And with strange aeons even death may die."

\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

For macroscopic systems in thermal equilibrium, the equation of state (EoS) is a central quantity that reflects not only the basic thermodynamic properties of the medium but also its active degrees of freedom and thus the underlying phase structure. For neutron stars (NSs)---extreme astrophysical objects containing the densest matter found in the present-day Universe---the EoS is furthermore closely related to their measurable macroscopic properties due to a link provided by General Relativity \cite{Tolman:1939jz,Oppenheimer:1939ne}. This has made NSs a unique laboratory for ultradense strongly interacting matter, with astrophysical observations informing model-agnostic studies of the EoS and attempts to determine the phase of matter inside the cores of NSs of different masses \cite{Hebeler:2013nza,Kurkela:2014vha,Most:2018hfd,Annala:2017llu, Tews:2018iwm,Landry:2018prl,Capano:2019eae,Miller:2019nzo,Essick:2019ldf,Raaijmakers:2019dks,Annala:2019puf,Dietrich:2020efo,Landry:2020vaw,Al-Mamun:2020vzu,Miller:2021qha,Essick:2021kjb,Raaijmakers:2021uju,

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) predicts that at very high densities, strongly interacting matter no longer resides in a phase where individual nucleons can be identified \cite{Polyakov:1978vu, Susskind:1979up, Shuryak:1980tp}. Instead, the active degrees of freedom become a set of elementary particles, quarks and gluons, that form a new phase dubbed quark matter (QM). In recent years, \emph{ab-initio} calculations in nuclear \citep{Tews:2012fj,Lynn:2015jua,Drischler:2017wtt,Drischler:2020hwi,Keller:2022crb} and particle \citep{Kurkela:2009gj,Gorda:2018gpy,Gorda:2021kme,Gorda:2021znl} theory have established that the respective EoSs of hadronic matter (HM) and QM are qualitatively distinct. While the hadronic EoS is controlled and characterized by the nucleon mass scale, its QM counterpart exhibits near-conformal properties, independent of any characteristic mass scales; see, e.g.~\cite{Annala:2019puf} for discussion and \cref{table1} for a summary of relevant results. With these advances in theoretical calculations and NS measurements, we are now in a position where the NS-matter EoS can be determined in a model-agnostic manner to decide which of these characteristics better describes matter inside the cores of massive stars. A firm answer to this question would determine whether or not deconfined QM is present in the cores of at least some NSs.




%





With few recent exceptions \cite{Gorda:2022jvk,Han:2022rug,Jiang:2022tps}, existing model-agnostic studies of the NS-matter EoS suffer from at least one of two limitations: either they fail to take into account high-density information from perturbative-QCD (pQCD) calculations, recently demonstrated to significantly constrain the NS-matter EoS down to realistic core densities \cite{Komoltsev:2021jzg,Gorda:2022jvk,Gorda:2023usm}, or they implement observational constraints in the form of hard cutoffs, severely limiting the number of measurements that can be employed. In this work, we remedy these shortcomings by generalizing our earlier analyses \cite{Annala:2017llu,Annala:2019puf,Annala:2021gom} to a Bayesian framework. This enables us to take advantage of altogether 12 simultaneous NS mass-radius (MR) measurements (see \cref{appAstro}) and make quantitative statements about the likelihood of a transition from hadronic to QM within stable NSs. 


Our analysis is performed using two independent frameworks, the parametric speed-of-sound interpolation of \cite{Annala:2019puf,Annala:2021gom} and the non-parametric Gaussian process (GP) regression of \cite{Gorda:2022jvk,Gorda:2023usm}, which are used to construct a prior for the EoS, connecting a low-density result provided by Chiral Effective Field Theory (CEFT) \cite{Hebeler:2013nza,Drischler:2020hwi} to a high-density limit given by pQCD \cite{Kurkela:2009gj,Gorda:2021znl}. 
This prior $P(\mathrm{EoS})$, introduced in detail in \cref{appA}, is then conditioned using a likelihood function incorporating astrophysical measurements,
\begin{eqnarray}
P({\rm EoS|data})&=&\frac{P({\rm data|EoS})P({\rm EoS})}{P({\rm data})}
\end{eqnarray}
with $P({\rm data|EoS})=\Pi_{i=1}^n P({\rm data}_i|{\rm EoS})$ corresponding to the uncorrelated individual likelihoods of various NS measurements, indexed here by $i$. These data, reviewed in \cref{appAstro}, include mass measurements corresponding to the most massive pulsars known \cite{Demorest:2010bx,Antoniadis:2013pzd,Fonseca:2016tux,Cromartie:2019kug,Fonseca:2021wxt}, the LIGO and Virgo tidal-deformability data from GW170817 \cite{TheLIGOScientific:2017qsa,LIGOScientific:2018cki}, and a number of individual mass-radius measurements using X-ray observations of pulsating, quiescent, and accreting neutron stars by the NICER and other collaborations \citep{Shawn:2018, Steiner:2017vmg, Nattila:2017wtj, Miller:2019cac, Riley:2019yda, Miller:2021qha, Riley:2021pdl}. 
As described in \cref{appA}, we also vary the number of independent parameters within our parametric interpolation to verify that our analysis is not impacted by too restricted behavior of the prior. Additionally, we have performed one analysis with a polytropic construction to further assess robustness (see \cref{app:eos_sweep}), and have ensured our posterior distributions have converged.


%

The main results from our analysis, reviewed below, take the form of posterior distributions for different physical quantities evaluated at the centers of NSs of various masses. The set of quantities considered includes the normalized trace anomaly ${\Delta\equiv (\epsilon -3p)/(3\epsilon)}$, its logarithmic rate of change with respect to the energy density ${\Delta' \equiv \mathrm{d} \Delta / \mathrm{d} \ln \epsilon}$, the polytropic index $\gamma\equiv \mathrm{d} \ln p / \mathrm{d} \ln \epsilon$, the speed of sound squared $c_\mathrm{s}^2\equiv \mathrm{d} p / \mathrm{d} \epsilon$, and the pressure normalized by that of a system of free quarks, $p/p_\text{free}$. As discussed in detail below, these quantities take markedly different values in (both low- and high-density) HM and in near-conformal QM at asymptotically high density, with $\Delta$ and $\Delta'$ forming a particularly useful pair for quantitatively tracking \emph{conformalization}, i.e., the effective restoration of conformal symmetry at high densities.

\section{From hadronic to deconfined matter: quantitative differences}

At very high baryon densities, where weak-coupling methods produce reliable results, strongly interacting matter is known to display near-conformal properties, with conformality only mildly broken by subdominant loop effects and by the small values of the up, down, and strange quark masses. As summarized in \cref{table1} and discussed in detail in \cite{Annala:2019puf,Fujimoto:2022ohj,Marczenko:2022jhl}, the characteristics of this system include a small positive normalized trace anomaly $\Delta$, a similarly small but negative $\Delta'$, a sound speed close to the conformal value, $c_\mathrm{s}^2 \lesssim 1/3$, and a polytropic index approaching the conformal limit from above, $\gamma \gtrsim 1$. Such values are common to many ultrarelativistic systems, but in stark contrast with those of the hadronic phase, also summarized in \cref{table1}. In the latter case, be it at low densities where robust \textit{ab-initio} results are available \cite{Tews:2012fj,Hebeler:2013nza} or at higher densities where one must resort to phenomenological models (see \cite{Annala:2019puf} for a review of results), the properties of hadronic matter are dominated by the nucleon mass scale that strongly breaks conformal symmetry.



As indicated in \cref{table1}, conformal symmetry determines the values of all of the above quantities, so that the approach of an individual quantity towards its conformal limit is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the restoration of conformal symmetry. In order to reliably establish the conformalization of NS matter, we therefore track all of these quantities, which allows us to distinguish certain local behaviors of the EoS, such as the onset of hyperonic degrees of freedom or a first-order phase transition (FOPT), from the full restoration of conformal symmetry. Particular emphasis will be given to the normalized trace anomaly $\Delta$ and its logarithmic derivative $\Delta'$, referred to as the derivative contribution to the speed of sound in \cite{Fujimoto:2022ohj}. 
These parameters are related to the polytropic index and the speed of sound via
\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta &=& \frac{1}{3} - \frac{c_\mathrm{s}^2}{\gamma}\, , \quad
\Delta'  \;=\; c_\mathrm{s}^2 \biggl( \frac{1}{\gamma} - 1 \biggr)\, , \label{eq:paramrels}
\end{eqnarray}
indicating that when both $|\Delta|$ and $|\Delta'|$ are small, $\gamma$ and $c_\mathrm{s}^2$ also approach their conformal limits 1 and 1/3.

%
\label{table1} 
\end{table}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



In order to draw a demarcation line, we combine the parameters $\Delta$ and $\Delta'$ into a single quantity, adopting the criterion
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:conformal-criterion}
d_{\mathrm{c}}&\equiv&\sqrt{\Delta^2+(\Delta')^2} \;<\; 0.2%\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\frac{1}{3}-{c_\mathrm{s}^2}_{\mathrm{PT}}\right)
\end{eqnarray}
for the identification of near-conformal matter at a given density. We justify the value 0.2 as follows. First, as noted in \cref{table1}, it represents a natural choice between the values this parameter takes in HM and conformal systems. Secondly, at a discontinuous FOPT, where $\Delta'=1/3-\Delta$ (see eq.~(\ref{eq:paramrels})), the quantity $d_\mathrm{c}$ can be shown to be bounded from below by $1/(3\sqrt{2}) \approx 0.236$, so that our criterion prevents FOPTs from masquerading as conformalized matter. We chose to round this value down to 0.2 to provide numerical tolerance for the approximate version of FOPTs (i.e.~arbitrarily rapid crossovers) considered in our analysis. Finally, as shown in \cref{table1}, this corresponds approximately to the largest value obtained for this quantity in pQCD. We note that the specific value 0.2 is a choice, but that our qualitative conclusions are insensitive to its small variations.

%

While QM is near-conformal, not all matter that is near-conformal is QM. Therefore, establishing conformalization of matter in the cores of NSs does not, in principle, imply the presence of the deconfined phase. One possible quantity not fixed by  conformal symmetry is the pressure normalized by the free (non-interacting) pressure $p/p_\mathrm{free}$. Its value is related to the effective number of active degrees of freedom (particle species) $N_{\rm eff}$ in both weakly and strongly coupled systems. At weak coupling, Dalton's law states that the pressure is the sum of partial pressures, which establishes the proportionality of $N_\mathrm{eff} \equiv N_f N_c p/p_\mathrm{free}$. This relation can be also derived in strongly coupled conformal field theories (CFTs) \cite{Cardy:1996xt,Gubser:1998nz} as well as in QCD at high temperatures \cite{Borsanyi:2013bia,HotQCD:2014kol}. Because this quantity is sensitive to the number of degrees of freedom but insensitive to the interaction strength, we expect that QM---be it weakly or strongly coupled---will have to exhibit a slowly varying $p/p_\mathrm{free}$ of order one. To this end, we may use its behavior to distinguish QM from other possible near-conformal phases at NS-core densities. 

From Table~\ref{table1}, we see that in high-density pQCD matter $p/p_\mathrm{free}$ is reduced from unity to approximately 0.6 through perturbative corrections. The normalized pressure has been extensively studied also in the context of high-temperature quark-gluon plasma (QGP), where it has played a key role in establishing that deconfined matter has been successfully produced in heavy-ion collisions (see, e.g.,~\cite{Borsanyi:2013bia,HotQCD:2014kol,Gardim:2019xjs}). 
%The crossover deconfinement transition takes place
%when $p/p_\mathrm{FD} \sim 0.1$ at high temperatures.
Nonperturbative lattice simulations have shown that above the pseudo-critical temperature,  its value saturates to a constant around $0.8$. In other high-temperature quantum field theories in the strongly-coupled limit, %$n_\mathrm{eff}$, defined in these cases by a 
$p/p_\mathrm{free}$ often takes fractional values smaller than one \cite{Sachdev:1993pr, Gubser:1998nz, Drummond:1997cw, Romatschke:2019ybu, DeWolfe:2019etx, Romatschke:2019mjm}, and for instance in $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills theory at infinite 't Hooft coupling, $p/p_\mathrm{free}=3/4$ \cite{Gubser:1998nz}. In certain lower-dimensional CFTs, the value of this quantity is moreover related to the central charge of the theory that counts the active degrees of freedom \cite{Cardy:1986ie, Cardy:1996xt}.

}
\label{fig:conformal-triangle}
\end{figure}


Our main results are displayed in \cref{fig:order-param,fig:conformal-params-density,fig:conformal-triangle,fig:dof-mu}, where we display the behavior of a number of physical quantities as functions of baryon number density, baryon chemical potential, or stellar mass. Starting from \cref{fig:order-param,fig:conformal-params-density}, we show credible intervals (CIs) for $d_{\mathrm{c}}$ and the triplet $c_\mathrm{s}^2$, $\gamma$, and $\Delta$ as functions of the baryon number density $n$, obtained using both a 4-segment speed-of-sound interpolation ($c_{\mathrm{s},4}^2$) and GP regression. In these figures, we also highlight 68\% CIs in number density corresponding to the cores of 1.4$M_\odot$, 2$M_\odot$, and maximally massive ($M_\mathrm{TOV}$) stars using colored bands, with the color scheme kept fixed throughout our plots. Contrasting the results with the entries of \cref{table1}, we observe that the cores of 1.4$M_\odot$ NSs feature highly nonconformal matter, while the cores of $M_\mathrm{TOV}$ stars, with $M = 2.27 \pm 0.11 M_\odot$ with 68\% credence, feature cores of approximately conformalized matter with high posterior probability. For the cores of $2M_\odot$ stars, roughly corresponding to the most massive NSs detected, the situation less clear, as they are seen to lie in the transition region between non-conformal and conformal behavior. Concretely, using the $c_{\mathrm{s},4}^2$ ensemble with the very conservative criterion introduced in \cref{eq:conformal-criterion}, we find the posterior probability for conformalized matter being present in maximally massive stars to be approximately 88\%, while the corresponding figures for $2M_\odot$ and $1.4M_\odot$ NSs are only 11\% and 0\%, respectively. The same probability for maximally massive stars using the nonparametric GP interpolation is 75\% (without QCD input 50\%), which should be considered a robust lower limit for the quantity given the very conservative way this method handles the high-density constraint. We note that these results are quantitatively stable between different computational choices (see \cref{app:eos_sweep}), and that they reflect the very conservative nature of the new criterion. Had we instead used the $\gamma<1.75$ criterion introduced in \cite{Annala:2019puf}, the posterior probability of conformalization in maximally massive stars would have been 99.8\% (see also \cite{Han:2022rug}).

The dark and light red bands, dash-dotted line, and colored bands carry the same meaning as in \cref{fig:order-param}. This quantity is seen to exhibit a plateau within maximally massive NSs, reminiscent of an effective restoration of conformal symmetry, with a value similar in magnitude to that of weakly coupled QM.}
    \label{fig:dof-mu}
\end{figure}

In \cref{fig:conformal-triangle}, we show next a detailed investigation of the posterior distributions of the quantities displayed in \cref{fig:conformal-params-density}. The results are shown both as two-dimensional CIs for the joint distributions between pairs of quantities and as one-dimensional probability density functions, all displayed for both the $c_{\mathrm{s},4}^2$ and GP ensembles. Shown in grey is finally the region corresponding to our conformal criterion $d_{\mathrm{c}} < 0.2$, which is seen to be considerably more restrictive than the criterion $\gamma < 1.75$ used in previous works \cite{Annala:2019puf,Han:2022rug}. For $\gamma$ and $c_\mathrm{s}^2$, we find good quantitative agreement with previous results, with the inner cores of maximally massive stars exhibiting conformalized behavior with high credence. For all three quantities, our results as functions of $M/M_\text{TOV}$ are moreover in good agreement with recent works \cite{Fujimoto:2022ohj,Ecker:2022xxj,Ecker:2022dlg,Altiparmak:2022bke, Marczenko:2022jhl, Jiang:2022tps}, with the approach towards conformal behavior as $M\to M_\mathrm{TOV}$ clearly visible. Finally, from the $\gamma$ vs.~$c_\mathrm{s}^2$ panels, we observe that the majority of probability weight for $M_\mathrm{TOV}$ stars that lies outside the grey region resides at small values of $\gamma$ and $c_\mathrm{s}^2$. This is indicative of FOPT-like behavior, implying that should the cores of $M_\mathrm{TOV}$ stars not contain conformalized matter, then they are destabilized by a FOPT, consistent with observations reported in \cite{Annala:2019puf}.




%

Having presented evidence for the likely conformalization of matter within the cores of maximally massive NSs, we move to an analysis of the number of active degrees of freedom. 
In \cref{fig:dof-mu} we show the behavior of the pressure normalized by its non-interacting limit, $p/p_\mathrm{free}$, as a function of baryon chemical potential $\mu$. Inspecting our results, we see a clear flattening of the normalized pressure in the vicinity of the cores of maximally massive NSs, characteristic of a conformal system, with a value $p/p_\mathrm{free} = 0.40 \pm 0.03$ with 68\% credence (corresponding to $N_\mathrm{eff} = 3.6 \pm 0.3$) that is about 2/3 of the central pQCD value in \cref{table1}. That the value of $p/p_\mathrm{free}$ within maximally massive NSs is so close to that of weakly coupled QM gives us confidence in labeling this phase deconfined QM. It is, however, interesting to ask whether the slightly reduced value of the quantity within maximally massive NSs may signal that matter in these stellar cores features strongly-coupled characteristics.

Finally, let us briefly note two interesting issues that go somewhat beyond the scope of our current work. First, in \cite{Takatsy:2023xzf} it was recently suggested that the posterior probability of QM cores sharply decreases somewhat below $M_{\rm TOV} \approx 2.3M_\odot$, so that if NSs more massive than this limit are discovered, QM cores can be ruled out. We have failed to reproduce this effect in our results, but instead find the probability of QM cores to have only a mild dependence of $M_{\rm TOV}$. Second, explicit FOPTs beginning at densities below  $2 n_\mathrm{sat}$ have recently been shown to have a noticeable impact on hard limits for the EoS \cite{Gorda:2022lsk}. While a generalization of our calculation to include explicit discontinuities in the EoS is clearly an interesting topic for further work, we again note that the criterion for near-conformality we have adopted in this work is very conservative. For this reason, we trust that the estimates we have obtained for the probability of finding conformalized matter inside massive NSs are
%not overly optimistic.
 reliable.

\section{Conclusions}

%\#\#
In the context of heavy-ion collisions, the properties of the equation of state (EoS) have played a key role in establishing the successful production of deconfined hot quark-gluon plasma.
%
While there is no discontinuous transition in this case, the two phases can still be clearly demarcated based on their qualitatively differing material properties. 
%
At low temperatures, the EoS exhibits the qualitative features of hadronic matter while at high $T$ it is characterized by approximate conformal symmetry and a number of active degrees of freedom corresponding to deconfined quarks and gluons. 
%
Note, however, that approximate conformal symmetry does not imply weak coupling: at the temperatures reached in collider experiments, weak-coupling methods remain poorly convergent, and the system exhibits strongly-coupled behavior. Nevertheless, the transition to QGP is identifiable from the restoration of the conformal symmetry, closely related to that of chiral symmetry. 


At high densities and low temperatures, the situation is in many ways similar to the above. In this Letter, we have established that the cores of the most massive neutron stars are very likely characterized by approximate conformal symmetry. We see signs of conformalization across multiple microscopic properties characterizing the EoS, including the speed of sound $c_\mathrm{s}^2$, polytropic index $\gamma$, normalized trace anomaly $\Delta$, and its logarithmic derivative (with respect to energy density) $\Delta'$. Moreover, we have introduced a new measure for the degree of conformality, $d_{\mathrm{c}} \equiv \sqrt{\Delta^2 + (\Delta')^2}$, the behavior of which exhibits a striking transition between $1.4M_\odot$ and maximally massive NSs, and we have determined that the number of active degrees of freedom appears to be consistent with theoretical expectations for the properties of QM. Concretely, we find that within the cores of maximally massive NSs, the ratio $p/p_\mathrm{free}$ is about 2/3 of its value in weakly coupled quark matter, leading us to the conclusion that the most massive neutron stars very likely harbor cores of deconfined QM. An 88\% probability (or 75\% with the GP method), obtained with a very conservative definition of near-conformality, provides a quantitative estimate of the remaining uncertainties, of which the most important one is related to the possible presence of a destabilizing first-order phase transition. %This uncertainty will likely be further decreased or increased with new theoretical \emph{ab-initio} results or NS observations in the near future.



To conclude, we note that in the context of heavy-ion collisions, evidence for the successful production of deconfined matter consisted of multiple arguments, of which the behavior of the EoS was but one. Similarly, it would be desirable to find other observables and arguments that may either support or contradict the evidence provided by our analysis of the EoS; for concrete suggestions, see e.g.~\cite{Alford:1997zt, Alford:2007xm, Alford:2010gw, Most:2018eaw, Fujimoto:2022xhv,Casalderrey-Solana:2022rrn}. Indeed, just as in the case of heavy-ion collisions, to compellingly establish the existence of QM in the cores of massive NSs, we need multiple lines of evidence all supporting the same picture.

\section{Methodology} \label{appA}

In this Appendix, we explain in detail, how our different prior EoS ensembles are constructed by joining together three different pieces: a low-density CEFT result applied up to approx.~$1.2n_\mathrm{sat}$, an intermediate density interpolator, and a high-density part obtained from pQCD that is used either from $\mu=2.6$ GeV onward or robustly translated down to $10n_\mathrm{sat}$ using the results of \cite{Komoltsev:2021jzg}. Here, the CEFT part depends of altogether five parameters in a way specified below, while the pQCD pressure only depends on one free parameter, the renormalization scale $\bar{\Lambda}$ of the $\msbar$ scheme. Finally, in the intermediate-density region we employ two independent approaches, one built with piecewise-defined polytropes or the speed-of-sound functions of \cite{Annala:2019puf} and the other based on a non-parametric Gaussian process regression introduced in \cite{Gorda:2022jvk}.


In the case of the parametric interpolation, we sample the parameter space with a Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo method using the \textsc{emcee} sampler \cite{Foreman_Mackey_2013}.
In practice, we use the affine-invariant stretch-move algorithm with $125$ parallel ``walkers'' to generate Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo chains with $N_\mathrm{chain}/\tau \sim 3 \times 10^3$ independent samples. 
%originating from the complete chain with $N_\mathrm{chain} \gtrsim 10^6$ samples.
Here, $\tau \sim 2 \times 10^4$ is the autocorrelation time, which can sometimes be very long due to the high-dimensional parameter space.
We have tested the numerical convergence of each calculation by generating sub-samples of the chains (with a jackknife re-sampling) and then verifying that the resulting credibility regions do not change.
In addition, for the particular case of the four-segment $c_s^2$ interpolation, used in the generation of our main results, we have verified the convergence by generating $50\%$ more samples
%longer chains
and noting that all the results remain unchanged.
Finally, we smooth the posterior distributions with kernel density estimation using Silverman's rule to estimate the kernel bandwidth. 


%


\subsection{Low-density EoS}

At low densities, up to slightly above the nuclear saturation density $n_\mathrm{sat}$, the NS-matter EoS can be reliably determined using the well-tested machinery of modern nuclear theory, including the systematic effective theory framework of CEFT \citep{Tews:2012fj,Lynn:2015jua,Drischler:2017wtt,Drischler:2020hwi,Keller:2022crb}. Specifically, we take the crust EoS from \cite{Baym:1971pw}, while starting from the crust-core transition around 0.5$n_\mathrm{sat}$, we use the results of \cite{Drischler:2020hwi} for pure neutron matter (PNM), reported up to 0.195~fm$^{-3}$, or slightly above $1.2n_\mathrm{sat}$. The upper limit for the pressure is chosen so that all (sampled) PNM EoSs have non-negative speeds of sound squared throughout the low-density interval considered, and we similarly ensure the same condition after beta equilibration.

%

To transform the PNM results into a beta-stable form, we utilize the Skyrme-motivated ansatz introduced in \cite{Hebeler:2013nza}, which expresses the sum of the interaction and kinetic energies in the form
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \frac{\epsilon_1(n, x)}{T_\mathrm{SNM}} =& \frac{3}{5} \left[ x^{5/3} + (1-x)^{5/3} \right] \left( 2 \bar{n} \right)^{2/3} \\ &- \left[ 2(\alpha - 2\alpha_L) x (1-x) + \alpha_L \right] \bar{n} \\ &+ \left[ 2(\eta - 2\eta_L) x (1-x) + \eta_L \right] \bar{n}^\gamma \, .
    \end{split}
    \label{eq:ike}
\end{equation}
Here, $x \equiv n_p/n$ denotes the proton fraction, $\bar{n} \equiv n / n_\mathrm{sat}$, and $\alpha$, $\alpha_L$, $\eta$, and $\eta_L$ are parameters that can be determined from the saturation properties of symmetric nuclear matter (see \cite{Hebeler:2013nza} for discussion and numerical values). The normalization constant $T_\mathrm{SNM}$ on the other hand stands for the Fermi energy of symmetric nuclear matter (SNM, $x=1/2$) at $n=n_\mathrm{sat}$,
\begin{equation}
    T_\mathrm{SNM} = \frac{1}{2 m_\text{B}} \left( \frac{3 \pi^2 n_\mathrm{sat} }{2} \right)^{2/3}
\end{equation}
where $m_\text{B}$ is the (mean) baryon mass, taken equal to that of the neutron $m_\text{N} \approx 939.565$~MeV. Finally, we add to \cref{eq:ike} an additional phenomenological term,
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\epsilon_2(n, x)}{T_\mathrm{SNM}} = - \zeta_L \left( \bar{n} - \bar{n}_0\right)^4\, ,
\end{equation}
where we have introduced two further phenomenological parameters $\bar{n}_0$ and $\zeta_{\text L}$. Their presence can be seen to lead to a considerable improvement in the model's ability to describe the CEFT data for PNM.


Following the original study \cite{Hebeler:2013nza}, we next require that the energy and pressure satisfy
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\epsilon(n_\mathrm{sat}, 1/2) = -16$~MeV,
    \item $p(n_\mathrm{sat}, 1/2) = 0$,
\end{enumerate}
where $\epsilon = \epsilon_1 + \epsilon_2$ and $p=n^2 \partial \epsilon / \partial n$, and which aids us in the selection of the model parameters $\alpha$ and $\eta$. At the same time, we do not fix the parameter $\gamma$ using a single value of the incompressibility parameter for SNM at saturation
\begin{equation}
    K_s = 9 n_\mathrm{sat}^2 \frac{\partial^2 \epsilon}{\partial n^2} (n_\mathrm{sat}, 1/2)
\end{equation}
as done in \cite{Hebeler:2013nza}, but rather consider $\gamma$ a free parameter following \cite{Raaijmakers:2021uju}. Moreover, with the mass difference between the proton and neutron approximated to zero, we note that the proton fraction $x\equiv n_\text{p}/n$ can be solved from the equation
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial\epsilon(\bar{n}, x)}{\partial x} + \mu_e(\bar{n}, x) = 0,
\end{equation}
where $\mu_e = \sqrt[3]{3 \pi^2 x n}$ is the electron chemical potential in the ultra-relativistic limit~\cite{Hebeler:2013nza}. 

In practice, we draw a large sample of the PNM EoSs of \cite{Drischler:2020hwi} using a prior distribution for the five PNM model parameters: $\alpha_L$, $\eta_L$, $\gamma$, $\zeta_L$, and $\bar{n}_0$. This distribution is then further approximated using a Gaussian mixture model to get a simpler and smoother multidimensional distribution, which is used to represent the CEFT result in building the NS-matter EoSs. 



%


\subsection{High-density EoS}

%

Due to the asymptotic freedom of QCD, at very high densities the behavior of cold ($T=0$) strongly interacting matter can be approached from the deconfined side using the machinery of modern perturbative thermal field theory. Here, we rely on state-of-the-art perturbative-QCD (pQCD) calculations for three-flavor quark matter, presented in detail in \cite{Kurkela:2009gj,Gorda:2021znl}. 


%

In the limit of beta equilibrium and strictly vanishing temperature, the pQCD pressure depends on only two parameters: the baryon chemical potential $\mu$ and the $\msbar$ renormalization scale $\bar{\Lambda}$. The latter is often scaled by the central value of two times the quark chemical potential $2\mu/3$ to create a dimensionless parameter $X \equiv 3 \bar{\Lambda} / (2 \mu)$, which is typically varied from 1/2 to 2. 
%To be maximally conservative, here we allow also smaller and larger values of $X$ by 
For the prior probability density on $X$, we use
\begin{equation}
    f(X) = \frac{1}{\left[ \ln (X_{\max} / X_{\min}) \right] X}
\end{equation}
with $X_{\min} = 1/2$ and $X_{\max} = 2$.
%
The pQCD pressure is then used for baryon chemical potentials $\mu \geq \mu_{\rm pQCD} = 2.6$~GeV, corresponding to baryon densities $n_{\rm pQCD} \gtrsim 40n_\mathrm{sat}$. 

%

\subsection{Intermediate densities}

As noted in the main text, at intermediate densities we use two independent and complementary methods for constructing the full EoSs, largely following earlier works \cite{Annala:2019puf,Annala:2021gom,Gorda:2022jvk}. As none of the methods we use here is new, we leave a more extensive technical introduction to the original references.

In the case of parametric interpolation, we use both a piecewise-polytropic or piecewise-linear-$c_\mathrm{s}^2$ EoSs with a varying number $N$ of intermediate segments between the CEFT and pQCD regimes. The resulting EoSs contain $2N+1$ or $2N$ free parameters in the polytropic and $c_\mathrm{s}^2$ cases, respectively. 


Finally, for the nonparametric GP calculations, we exactly follow the prior construction of \cite{Gorda:2022jvk}.

%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Astrophysical measurements and constraints \label{appAstro}}

In addition to the theoretical constraints discussed above, our EoS models have been further conditioned using astrophysical observations. We list and discuss these measurements here.

\subsection{Pulsar mass measurements}

We demand that an EoS be compatible with the latest mass measurements of massive pulsars. So far, two NS systems have been observed likely containing a two-solar-mass NS, PSR J0348+0432 ($M=2.01 \pm 0.04~M_\odot$, 68\% confidence interval)~\cite{Antoniadis:2013pzd} and PSR J0740+6620 ($M=2.08 \pm 0.07~M_\odot$, 68\% credible interval)~\cite{Fonseca:2021wxt}. 
We model these mass measurements as normally distributed, i.e. $M_{0432}/M_\odot \sim \mathcal{N}(2.01,0.04^2)$ and $M_{6620}/M_\odot \sim \mathcal{N}(2.08,0.07^2)$, respectively. 

We then require that the TOV mass derived from a target EoS has to be greater than the observed masses of these two stars; otherwise, the EoS in question is discarded.

\subsection{Tidal deformabilities}

We use GW data from the first binary  NS merger event GW170817~\footnote{The LIGO/Virgo collaboration has also detected another possible NS-NS merger event GW190425~\cite{LIGOScientific:2020aai}. It is, however, unfortunately too faint to be of use to constrain the NS-matter EoS and is therefore omitted.  Moreover, the collaboration has also detected three possible BH-NS merger events: GW190814~\cite{LIGOScientific:2020zkf}, GW200105, and GW200115~\cite{LIGOScientific:2021qlt}. It is, however, very likely that GW190814 is just another BH-BH event.} collected by the LIGO/Virgo collaboration~\cite{TheLIGOScientific:2017qsa}. In particular, we use the marginalized 2d posterior distribution for the tidal deformabilities of the two merger components, given in Fig.~1 of \cite{LIGOScientific:2018cki}. The individual tidal deformabilities for our EoSs are on the other hand calculated using formulae given in Ref.~\cite{Landry:2014jka} assuming that both compact objects are NSs.

In our analysis, we use two prior variables, the chirp mass of the binary
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{M} = \frac{(m_1 m_2)^{3/5}}{(m_1+m_2)^{1/5}}
\end{equation}
and the mass ratio $q = m_2/m_1$, where $m_1>m_2$, instead of the individual masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ of the binary components. The LIGO/Virgo collaboration has determined the binary chirp mass to be $\mathcal{M}=1.186 \pm 0.001~M_\odot$ (90\% symmetric credibility limits)~\cite{LIGOScientific:2018hze}, which we take to be normally distributed, i.e. ${\mathcal{M}/M_{\odot} \sim \mathcal{N}(1.186,3.7\times10^{-7})}$. The distribution of the mass ratio $q$ is on the other hand chosen to be uniform between 0.4 and 1, i.e. ${q \sim \mathcal{U}(0.4,1)}$. Finally, we discard all parameter candidates that do not satisfy 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $m_1, \, m_2 \leq M_{\rm TOV}$ and
    \item $\Lambda(m_1), \, \Lambda(m_2) \leq 1600$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Mass-radius measurements from X-ray observations}

The generated EoSs are also constrained by 12 astrophysical NS mass-radius measurements that are introduced in \cref{tab:astro} together with the chosen mass priors.  The corresponding radius of an individual star can be determined using the TOV equations when the EoS is generated and a candidate mass is drawn from a uniform prior distribution, $m_i \sim \mathcal{U}(m_{\mathrm{min}}, m_{\mathrm{max}})$, where $m_{\mathrm{min}}$ and $m_{\mathrm{max}}$ are the minimum and maximum masses, respectively.
The limits of each mass prior are selected such that they encapsulate the complete range of the mass-radius measurement, with a maximal range of $m_i/M_\odot \in [0.5, 2.8]$. When possible, tighter limits are selected because they lead to more efficient sampling of the distribution
We also ignore the additional factor to the prior, $\sim (m_{\rm TOV} - m_{\mathrm{min}})^{-1}$, correcting for the mass selection bias, as the factor is to a good approximation constant for our choice of $m_{\mathrm{min}} \approx 0.5 M_{\odot}$ \cite{Miller:2019nzo,Landry:2020vaw}.


%NICER pulsars
Proceeding to the individual measurements considered, we first use the 2d mass-radius probability distributions of the pulsars PSR J0030$+$0451 and PSR J0740$+$6620 as reported by the NICER mission. The PSR J0030$+$0451 measurement is based on  publicly available data from \cite{Riley:2019yda} employing their ST+PST model, while the PSR J0740$+$6620 measurement is similarly based on publicly available data from \cite{Miller:2021qha}. From the latter reference, we employ their combined NICER+XMM constraints together with the inflated cross-instrument calibration error. The differences between this choice and other possible models would result in small radius differences of $\Delta R \lesssim 0.1\km$.

\end{table*}

%bursters
In addition to the above, we also incorporate 2d mass-radius measurements from three different X-ray bursters. The most accurate constraint corresponds to the neutron star in the binary system 4U J1702$-$429 and is derived using direct atmosphere model fits to time-evolving energy spectra \cite{Nattila:2017wtj}. Here, we use their model D measurement corresponding to a fit with a free mass, radius, and composition. The other two neutron star mass-radius measurements, corresponding to the binary systems 4U 1724$-$307 and SAX J1810.8$-$260 \citep{Nattila:2015jra},  are derived using a cooling tail method analysis \citep{2017MNRAS.466..906S}. We do not consider other possible bursting sources because of the large uncertainty related to the unconstrained accretion disk state \citep{2014MNRAS.445.4218K}. We also note that no rotational effects are modeled in \citep{2020A&A...639A..33S}; these can introduce an additional uncertainty of order $0.5\,\mathrm{km}$ into the radius of a rapidly rotating source. 

%
Lastly, we use mass-radius measurements of seven neutron stars in quiescent low-mass X-ray binary systems \cite{Shawn:2018,Steiner:2017vmg}. We only use systems with reliable distance measurements, which enables breaking the degeneracy between the observed flux and emitted luminosity (i.e., the size of the emitting region and the emitter distance). We use models that assume the surface to be uniformly emitting, incicating the absence of hot/cold spots. The atmosphere composition is selected manually (from H vs.~He) using a composition that gives a radius of $R \approx 12\km$; varying the composition causes a large ($\sim 2\times$) change in $R$, so the selection of a realistic composition is relatively unambiguous for all of the used sources.





\subsection{SMNS/HMNS merger remnant in GW170817}

The timing and spectral properties of the short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) and kilonova from the GW170817 event are also used to set additional constraints for the EoS. These constraints are based on astrophysical jet generation and launching models that have demonstrated that the jet launching from a black hole merger remnant is strongly favored for sGRB events.
Additionally, the prolonged existence of a supramassive/hypermassive NS (SMNS /HMNS, respectively) remnant is disfavored because of the observed moderate kinetic energy of the kilonova/sGRB: a SMNS/HMNS inside a thick disk would release a substantial rotational energy into the surrounding kilonova, strongly modifying its appearance. No such modifications, such as a prolonged prompt emission phase or strong blue shifted winds, were detected from GW170817. This implies that the merger remnant either (i) collapsed immediately into a black hole or (ii) formed a SMNS or HMNS remnant that then shortly after collapsed into a black hole (see, e.g.~\cite{Annala:2021gom} and references therein).

The short gamma ray burst from GW170817 was detected with a lag of $\lesssim 2\,\mathrm{s}$ after the NS merger, measured as the difference between the peak of the gravitational wave signal and the arrival of the first $\gamma$-rays. We therefore require that the remnant must (at least) form a supramassive NS and therefore has a total (baryon) mass exceeding the (baryon) TOV mass, $m_{b,1} + m_{b,2} > m_{b, \mathrm{TOV}}$. We assume here zero ejecta for the merger process, following previous works (see \cite{Annala:2021gom} for references and discussion). Additionally, we note that the short lag of $\lesssim 2\,\mathrm{s}$ favors the HMNS scenario, given that SMNSs are expected to be more long-lived with typical lifetimes of $\gtrsim 10\mathrm{s}$. Enforcing the HMNS scenario would lead to an even more stringent constraint, $m_1 + m_2 > m_{\mathrm{SMNS}}$, but following \cite{Annala:2021gom}, here we only consider the more relaxed constraints following from SMNS formation.

%

\section{Comparison of the constructed EoSs}
\label{app:eos_sweep}

Our fiducial EoS consists of a piecewise-linear $c_\mathrm{s}^2$ interpolant with $N = 4$ intermediate segments as a function of the baryon chemical potential $\mu$, for which we use the shorthand notation $c_{\mathrm{s},4}^2$. We have benchmarked the robustness of the corresponding results to other interpolation methods, including a varying number of interpolation segments, with results of this comparison displayed in \cref{fig:diff-interps}. Comparing the parameter regions that the models can sample for $d_\mathrm{c}$, $c_{\mathrm{s}}^2$, $\gamma$, $p$, and the NS mass-radius relation, we find that four segments provides the minimum viable interpolation accuracy. The biggest shortcoming of the computationally most-economic three-segment model (i.e., $c_{\mathrm{s},3}^2$) is the lack of EoSs that mimic phase transitions at densities of $n \approx 5-10n_\mathrm{sat}$, whereas only negligible deviations are found between the four-segment and five-segment models. We note in passing that the polytropic interpolation  ($p_N$) gives very similar results when the number of segments $N$ is at least four.

A similar comparison of the effects of various astrophysical observations on our results is shown in figs.~\ref{fig:diff-meas} and \ref{fig:diff-meas-gp}, where we separately consider the $c_{\mathrm{s},4}^2$ and GP methods, respectively. In particular, we compare the resulting Bayesian posterior distributions for calculations with no astrophysical measurements (denoted as ``$\mathrm{no~obs.}$''); only mass-measurements from radio pulsars (``$\mathrm{r}$''); pulsar mass measurements, GW deformabilities, and the SMNS hypothesis for  GW170817 (``$\mathrm{r~+GW}$''); and finally pulsar mass measurements, GW deformabilities, the SMNS hypothesis for GW170817, and X-ray measurements (``r+GW+X-ray'').
Our fiducial calculations are based on the measurement set ``r+GW+X-ray'', which includes all measurements. We note that especially $d_\mathrm{c}$ does not strongly depend on the inclusion of X-ray measurements, and that there are some interesting quantitative differences between the responses of the $c_{\mathrm{s},4}^2$ and GP ensembles to the astrophysical measurements. 
This may be partially related to the fact that in fig.~\ref{fig:diff-meas-gp}, the high-density constraint from pQCD is only included in the fifth additional column, owing to the fact that in this approach it is possible to turn this effect on and off at will. Once all observations and the pQCD input have been included, our final results for different physical quantities obtained using the two methods largely agree.

The following columns show the $c_{\mathrm{s}}^2$ interpolation with an increasing number of linear segments from $3$ ($c_{\mathrm{s},3}^2$) to 4 ($c_{\mathrm{s},4}^2$) to 5 ($c_{\mathrm{s},5}^2$).
The last column shows the Gaussian processes parameterization ($\mathrm{GP}$).
The rows show the evolution of the conformal measure $d_\mathrm{c}$, the speed of sound squared $c_\mathrm{s}^2$, polytropic index $\gamma$, mass-radius $M$--$R$ relation, and pressure-energy-density $p$--$\epsilon$. 
The colorbars are tailored specifically to best highlight the variations in the probability density.

\caption{Model comparison showing the effect of different measurements on the $c_{\mathrm{s},4}^2$ parameterization.
The first column shows the CIs of various quantities with an EoS parameterization that does not have any astrophysical measurements (prior).
The second column shows the Bayesian posterior densities for EoS conditioned with the $\approx 2 M_\odot$ radio pulsar mass measurements.
The third column shows the calculations with pulsar masses and tidal deformabilities from GW170817, as well as the assumption that a SMNS was formed in GW170817.
The fourth column shows the calculation with pulsar masses, tidal deformabilities, the assumption that a SMNS was formed in GW170817, and X-ray measurements.
Other quantities and symbols are the same as in \cref{fig:diff-interps}.

Model comparison showing the effect of different measurements on the GP parameterization.
The first column shows the CIs of various quantities with an EoS that does not have any astrophysical measurements nor high-density QCD input (prior).
The second column shows the Bayesian posterior densities for an EoS conditioned with the $\approx 2 M_\odot$ radio pulsar mass measurements. The third column shows the calculations with pulsar masses, tidal deformabilities from GW170817, as well as the assumption that the remnant in GW170817 collapsed to a black hole. The fourth column shows the calculation with pulsar masses, tidal deformabilities, the assumption that GW170817 collapsed to a BH, and X-ray measurements. The fifth column shows shows the calculations with all the astrophysical input from the fourth column, along with the addition of the high-density QCD input.  Other quantities and symbols are the same as in \cref{fig:diff-interps}.

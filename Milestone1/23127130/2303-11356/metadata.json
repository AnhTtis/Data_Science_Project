    "abstract": "The inner cores of massive neutron stars contain strongly interacting matter at the highest densities reached in our Universe. Under these conditions the cores may undergo a phase transition to deconfined quark matter, which exhibits approximate conformal symmetry. Using a Bayesian inference setup that utilizes all available neutron-star measurements and state-of-the-art theoretical calculations, we demonstrate that in the cores of the most massive stars the equation of state is consistent with the presence of deconfined quark matter. We do this by (i) establishing an effective conformal symmetry restoration with 88% credence at the highest densities probed in these objects, and (ii) demonstrating that the number of active degrees of freedom favors an interpretation of this finding in terms of the presence of deconfined matter. The remaining probability for purely hadronic maximal-mass stars arises from equation-of-state behavior featuring small sound-speed and polytropic-index values, consistent with a first-order phase transition.",

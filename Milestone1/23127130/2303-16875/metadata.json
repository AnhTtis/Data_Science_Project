    "abstract": "The theory of linear Fredholm integral-functional equations of the second kind with linear functionals and with a parameter is considered. The necessary and sufficient conditions are obtained for the coefficients of the equation and those parameter values, in the nighbohood of which the equation has solutions. The leading terms of the asymptotics of the solutions are constructed. The constructive method is proposed for constructing a solution both in the regular case and in the irregular one. In the regular case, the solution is constructed as a Taylor series in powers of the parameter. In the irregular case, the solution is constructed as a Laurent series in powers of the parameter. Constructive theory and method is demonstrated on the model example.",

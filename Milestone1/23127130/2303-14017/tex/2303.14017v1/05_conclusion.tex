\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we design a content fusion module and a projected character loss to improve the quality of skeleton transfer in few-shot font generation. We also propose a iterative style-vector refinement strategy to find a better font-level style representation. Experiments demonstrate that our method can outperform existing state-of-the-art methods, and each of the proposed novel modules is effective. 

In the future, we may try vector font generation because vector characters are scale-invariant and more convenient for practical applications. It would be interesting to investigate whether the content fusion strategy can help solve the problem of complex vector font generation.

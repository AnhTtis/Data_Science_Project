    "abstract": "In this paper we introduce the class of graded Poisson color algebras as the natural generalization of graded Poisson algebras and graded Poisson superalgebras. For $Λ$ an arbitrary abelian group, we show that any of such $Λ$-graed Poisson color algebra $\\mathcal{P}$, with a symmetric $Λ$-support is of the form $\\mathcal{P} = \\mathcal{U}\\oplus\\sum_j I_j$, with $\\mathcal{U}$ a subspace of $\\mathcal{P}_1$ and any $I_j$ a well described graded ideal of $\\mathcal{P},$ satisfying $\\{I_j, I_k\\}+I_j I_k=0$ if $j\\neq i.$ Furthermore, under certain conditions, the gr-simplicity of $\\mathcal{P}$ is characterized and it is shown that $\\mathcal{P}$ is the direct sum of the family of its graded simple ideals.",

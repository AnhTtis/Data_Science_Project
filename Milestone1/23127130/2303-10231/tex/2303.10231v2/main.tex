\begin{abstract}
Uneven terrain necessarily transforms periodic walking into a non-periodic motion. As such, traditional stability analysis tools no longer adequately capture the ability of a bipedal robot to locomote in the presence of such disturbances.
% Despite the importance of periodic stability for bipedal robots, uneven terrain necessarily perturbs the system away from the nominal orbit. 
This motivates the need for analytical tools aimed at generalized notions of stability -- robustness. 
% Specifically, tools are needed to characterize the domain on which the orbit is stable. 
Towards this, we propose a novel definition of robustness, termed \emph{$\delta$-robustness}, to characterize the domain on which a nominal periodic orbit remains stable despite uncertain terrain. This definition is derived by treating perturbations in ground height as disturbances in the context of the input-to-state-stability (ISS) of the extended Poincar\'{e} map associated with a periodic orbit. The main theoretic result is the formulation of robust Lyapunov functions that certify $\delta$-robustness of periodic orbits.  This yields an optimization framework for verifying $\delta$-robustness, which is demonstrated in simulation with a bipedal robot walking on uneven terrain.

% Achieving stable bipedal locomotion is a challenging control task, especially when considering uncertain terrain. One approach with demonstrated success is to generate provably stable nominal walking behaviors, encoded by periodic orbits, and then use either feedback controllers or online planning to drive the system to the nominal behavior. 
% A benefit of this approach is that the stability of the nominal gait can then be analyzed using the method of Poincar\'e sections for systems with impulse effects. However, it is not guaranteed that each nominal walking behavior will remain stable in the presence of uncertain impact events. In this work, we extend the notion of stability for nominal periodic orbits with uncertain impact events by instead viewing walking from an input-to-state stable (ISS) perspective.
% In this work, we explore the conditions required to certify robustness of nominal hybrid periodic orbits in the presence of uncertain impact events, with a specific view of input-to-state stability (ISS). While online planning may still be required for large disturbances and changes in the environment, robust nominal periodic orbits would ultimately enable easier control tasks and reduce the amount of required control input.

\section{Conclusion}
In this work, a novel notion of robustness, \emph{$\delta$-robustness}, was formulated from the perspective of input-to-state stability.
% This definition differs from classic notions of stability by instead quantifying the magnitude of perturbations a periodic orbit can withstand while remaining stable. 
Lyapunov conditions were also derived to certify $\delta$-robustness for a nominal periodic orbit. Future work includes directly evaluating $\delta$-robustness in the gait generation process to systematically generate periodic orbits that are robust to uncertain terrain. Additionally, sampling methods can be leveraged to obtain probabilistic guarantees on $\delta$-robustness. Lastly, the discrete-time Lyapunov condition can be translated to a stochastic condition in order to obtain more realistic (albeit probabilistic) estimates of the $\delta$-robustness. 

    
 % In this work, a novel notion of robustness is formulated, termed $\delta$-robustness, to characterize the robustness of a nominal periodic orbit to uncertain terrain by treating perturbations in ground height as disturbances in the context of input-to-state-stability (ISS). The main theoretic result is the construction of robust Lyapunov functions to certify $\delta$-robustness of periodic orbits as well as the synthesis of an optimization framework for verifying $\delta$-robustness. These constructions are demonstrated in simulation with a seven-link bipedal robot.

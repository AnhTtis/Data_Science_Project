The dynamics of the power system are described by a system of differential-algebraic equations. Time-domain simulations are used to understand the evolution of the system dynamics. These simulations can be computationally expensive due to the stiffness of the system which requires the use of finely discretized time-steps. By increasing the allowable time-step size, we aim to accelerate such simulations. In this paper, we use the observation that even though the individual components are described using both algebraic and differential equations, their coupling only involves algebraic equations. Following this observation, we use \glspl{NN} to approximate the components' state evolution, leading to fast, accurate, and numerically stable approximators, which enable larger time-steps. To account for effects of the network on the components and vice-versa, the \glspl{NN} take the temporal evolution of the coupling algebraic variables as an input for their prediction. We initially estimate this temporal evolution and then update it in an iterative fashion using the Newton-Raphson algorithm. The involved Jacobian matrix is calculated with Automatic Differentiation and its size depends only on the network size but not on the component dynamics. We demonstrate this \gls{NN}-based simulator on the IEEE 9-bus test case with 3 generators.

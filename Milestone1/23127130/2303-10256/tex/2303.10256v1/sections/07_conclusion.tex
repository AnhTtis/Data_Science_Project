This work presented a simulation approach that centers around finding iteratively an approximation of the evolution of the algebraic variables in the power system \glspl{DAE}. The approximation of the dynamic state evolutions by NNs, instead of classical explicit numerical integration schemes, allows larger time-steps to be realized while being fast to execute. This work aimed at providing a proof of concept, it is foreseeable that future work on this method shares many typical questions with established \gls{DAE} solvers, hence, by applying various existing techniques the computational performance and scalability of the approach should improve significantly.

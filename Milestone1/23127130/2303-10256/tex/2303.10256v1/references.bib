	doi = {10.1109/PROC.1979.11233},
	abstract = {Engineers in the power industry, face the problem that, while stability is increasingly a limiting factor in secure system operation, the simulation of system dynamic response is grossly overburdening on present-day digital computing resources. Each individual response case involves the step-by-step numerical solution in the time domain of perhaps thousands of nonlinear differential-algebraic equations, at a cost of up to several thousand dollars. A high premium is thus to be placed on the use of the most efficient and reliable modern calculation techniques. This paper is a critical tutorial-review of the calculation methods used routinely or investigated for use by the industry. It concentrates on solution concepts and computational techniques rather than on the analysis of the numerical methods. Details of system modeling are only emphasized when they affect the choice of solution method. The paper concludes with a view of the state of the art and a prediction of future directions of development.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a novel non-iterative method to solve power system differential algebraic equations (DAEs) using the differential transformation, which is a mathematical tool able to obtain power series coefficients by transformation rules instead of calculating high order derivatives and has proved to be effective in solving state variables of nonlinear differential equations in our previous study. This paper further solves non-state variables, e.g., current injections and bus voltages, directly with a realistic DAE model of power grids. These non-state variables, nonlinearly coupled in network equations, are conventionally solved by numerical methods with time-consuming iterations, but their differential transformations are proved to satisfy formally linear equations in this paper. Thus, a non-iterative algorithm is designed to analytically solve all variables of a power system DAE model with ZIP loads. From test results on a Polish 2383-bus system, the proposed method demonstrates fast and reliable time performance compared to traditional numerical approaches including the implicit trapezoidal rule method and a partitioned scheme using the explicit modified Euler method and Newton Raphson method.},

PyTorch is a machine learning library that shows that these two goals are in fact compatible: it was designed from first principles to support an imperative and Pythonic programming style that supports code as a model, makes debugging easy and is consistent with other popular scientific computing libraries, while remaining efficient and supporting hardware accelerators such as GPUs.
In this paper, we detail the principles that drove the implementation of PyTorch and how they are reflected in its architecture. We emphasize that every aspect of PyTorch is a regular Python program under the full control of its user. We also explain how the careful and pragmatic implementation of the key components of its runtime enables them to work together to achieve compelling performance.
We demonstrate the efficiency of individual subsystems, as well as the overall speed of PyTorch on several commonly used benchmarks.},

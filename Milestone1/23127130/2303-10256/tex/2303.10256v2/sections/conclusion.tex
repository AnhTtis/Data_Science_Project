\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

With PINNSim, we introduced a novel approach for time-domain simulations that allows the integration of \glspl{PINN}. As a result we achieve accurate results with significantly larger time steps than with the common trapezoidal method. Hence, we require fewer time steps which could result in a significant acceleration of time-domain simulations in power systems. By design, we only require the training of \glspl{PINN} for single dynamical components and thereby enable the scalability of PINNSim to large systems. Additionally, all calculations at run-time are highly scalable and parallelisable, necessary requirements to develop PINNSim into a powerful simulator.

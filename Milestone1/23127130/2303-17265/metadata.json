    "abstract": "The semi-analytical method obtains the solution for linear/nonlinear ODEs and PDEs in series form. This article presents a novel semi-analytical approach named Daftardar-Jafari method (DJM) to solve integro-partial differential equation such as breakage and nonlinear aggregation-breakage equations (ABE). Four test cases for the breakage equation are used to acquire closed form series solutions. Further, numerical findings such as number density and moments are compared with the analytical solutions to show the efficiency and accuracy of the method. Moreover, the DJM is employed to solve the well-known ABE, and truncated solutions are presented for the two test cases. In addition, absolute errors over various time periods are depicted in the form of tables.",

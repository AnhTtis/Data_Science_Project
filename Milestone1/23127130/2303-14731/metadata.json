    "abstract": "Let $ν$ be a Borel probability measure on a $d$-dimensional Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^d$, $d\\geq 1$, with a compact support, and let $(p_0, p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_N)$ be a probability vector with $p_j>0$ for $1\\leq j\\leq N$. Let $\\{S_j: 1\\leq j\\leq N\\}$ be a set of contractive mappings on $\\mathbb R^d$. Then, a Borel probability measure $μ$ on $\\mathbb R^d$ such that $μ=\\sum_{j=1}^N p_jμ\\circ S_j^{-1}+p_0ν$ is called an inhomogeneous measure, also known as a condensation measure on $\\mathbb R^d$. For a given $r\\in (0, +\\infty)$, the quantization dimension of order $r$, if it exists, denoted by $D_r(μ)$, of a Borel probability measure $μ$ on $\\mathbb R^d$ represents the speed at which the $n$th quantization error of order $r$ approaches to zero as the number of elements $n$ in an optimal set of $n$-means for $μ$ tends to infinity. In this paper, we investigate the quantization dimension for such a condensation measure.",

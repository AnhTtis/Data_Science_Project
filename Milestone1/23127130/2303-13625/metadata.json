    "abstract": "In many occurrences of fluid-structure interaction time-periodic motions are observed. We consider the interaction between a fluid driven by the three dimensional Navier-Stokes equation and a two dimensional linearized elastic Koiter shell situated at the boundary. The fluid-domain is a part of the solution and as such changing in time periodically. On a steady part of the boundary we allow for the physically relevant case of dynamic pressure boundary values, prominent to model inflow/outflow. We provide the existence of at least one weak time-periodic solution for given periodic external forces that are not too large. For that we introduce new approximation techniques and a-priori estimates.",

Dynamic reliability can be used to react and cater to varying network topolgies with fluctuating measurements. Adhering to governing policies in changing the per-packet reliability status to deal with bandwidth, loss and delay constraints without deteriorating the \gls{aoi}. Less resource intensive requirements can reduce the cost of communication for operators and free scarce resources for alternative traffic.

Future work will consider a holistic dynamic reliability policy for interchangeable network conditions whilst focusing on the over all quality of service from both a user and an operator perspective.

\begin{abstract}

    5G and Beyond networks promise low-latency support for applications that need to deliver mission-critical data with strict deadlines. However, innovations on the physical and medium access layers are not sufficient. Additional considerations are needed to support applications under different network topologies, and while network setting and data paths change. Such support could be developed at the transport layer, ensuring end-to-end latency in a dynamic network and connectivity environment. In this paper, we present a partial reliability framework, which governs per-packet reliability through bespoke policies at the transport layer. The framework follows a \textit{no-ack} and \textit{no-retransmit} philosophy for unreliable transmission of packets, yet maintains cooperation with its reliable counterpart for arbitrary use of either transmission mode. This can then address latency and reliability fluctuations in a changing network environment, by smartly altering packet reliability. Our evaluations are conducted using mininet to simulate real-world network characteristics, while using a video streaming application as a real-time use-case. The results demonstrate the reduction of session packet volume and backlogged packets, with little to no effect on the freshness of the packet updates.

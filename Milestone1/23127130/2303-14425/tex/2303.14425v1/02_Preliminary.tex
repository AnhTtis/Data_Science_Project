\subsubsection{Entity, Predicate, Triple, Subject, Object,\\ Knowledge Graph.}  
An \textbf{\emph{entity}} can be a thing, person, place, e.g. \texttt{Apple Inc.}, \texttt{Donald Trump}, \texttt{U.S.}, etc. 
A \textbf{\emph{predicate}} describes the characteristics of the entity. 
A \textbf{\emph{triple}} $<s, p, o>$ is the fact that describes \emph{\textbf{subject}} $s$, while $p$ is a predicate, and $o$ is \emph{\textbf{object}}.
For example, triple $<$\texttt{U.S.}, \texttt{President}, \texttt{Donald Trump}$>$ represents the fact that the president of the U.S. is Donald Trump. 
Then a \textbf{\emph{Knowledge Graph~(KG)}} $G=<E, T>$ consists of entities $E$ and triples $T$. 
Specifically, entities and triples constitute the essential elements of a KG~\cite{lehmann2015dbpedia}.
And Open-KG, which differs from the Knowledge Bases~(KB), is the most primitive KG, while KB is a strictly processed KG.

\subsubsection{Relation, Property, Value.}

Predicate can be further divided into relation and property.
A \emph{\textbf{relation}} is generally used to represent the relationship between entities, while a \emph{\textbf{property}} is used to describe some features of a subject.
\emph{\textbf{Value}} is a concrete description to the subject.
So both entity and value can all be the object to a triple, while only entity can be the subject to a triple.
A relation connects two entities, while a property connects an entity and a value.




\subsubsection{Synonym, Synonymous Expression, Synset.} 
\emph{\textbf{Synonym}} is a word or phrase that means exactly or nearly the same as another word or phrase~\cite{stanojevic2009cognitive}.  
For example, “Aspirin” and “Acetylsalicylic Acid” refer to the same drug; “United States” and “USA” represent the same country. 
\emph{\textbf{Synonymous expression}} is a relaxed form of synonym, which is a sequence of characters that means exactly or nearly the same as another sequence of characters in the same language. 
For example, “gender male” and “man gender” refer to the same gender.
And \emph{\textbf{synset}} is a set of synonyms or synonymous expressions that are grouped together.

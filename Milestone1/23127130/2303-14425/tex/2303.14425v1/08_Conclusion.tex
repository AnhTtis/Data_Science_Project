In this paper, we aim to boost the performance of the models in synonym understanding.
We propose the Sem4SAP framework, which consists of three main components.
First, we do the Synonymous Values mining in Open-KG. 
Then we expand the mined synsets. 
Finally, we use two synonym-aware pretraining methods to boost the PLMs’ understanding of synonyms.
In the future, we want to use our method to mine more synsets and release them after manual annotation.
% We propose to mine synsets in an online encyclopedia, design a synsets expansion method to enlarge the size of synsets, and use the synsets to do the text data augmentation for generating irregular text data.
% With a huge amount of irregular data, the understanding of the models of irregular text is boosted effectively.
% Besides, we manually check the synsets we have collected and release them in English and Chinese language for further researches.

We attempt to solve an autonomous object manipulation problem by the means of pivoting using a fixed robot arm coupled with an RGB-D side camera, gripper finger tactile sensors and a force/torque wrist sensor. Solid, box-shaped objects of varying dimensions, weights and weight distributions will be the objects for manipulation. The dimensions and weights of the box are known and at least one dimension of the box will be graspable by the robot.
The problems to be investigated is twofold:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Pose Estimation}
    
    Given a box resting on a surface, the robot will use its gripper to pivot the box. The robot will need to estimate the pose of the box and use that to find the desired pose for grasping and the edge for pivoting.

    
    %\item \textbf{Ideal force profile estimation and Gripper Slip Estimation} 
    
    %Two specific aspects of the object are to be continuously monitored: the change in the force/torque sensor, and slip between it and the gripper fingers. The box pose derived from visual data, tactile data, as well as force and torque data, will be used for this purpose. The change in force could suggest if the box is being pushed too much or lifted too high. Slip from the gripper will be differentiated between translational and rotational slip, and the presence of each is to be detected. 
   
    % and whether it is in contact through a point, a vertex or a surface of the object.
    
    \item \textbf{Active Closed-Loop Control System} 
    
    Given that there are visual, force/torque and tactile sensors, an algorithm must be developed that can combine and make use of all three sensors simultaneously. An active closed-loop control system will be developed, where the state of the object will be continuously updated and used as feedback to control the joint states and motion of the robot. A control scheme will be derived to modify the robot's motion trajectory to pivot the box while maintaining contact with the surface. Meanwhile, slip estimation will be performed to control the gripper. This will achieve the desired slip effect specific to the task, that is, rotational slip during pivoting with no translational slip. The system will run until the box reaches its desired end goal.

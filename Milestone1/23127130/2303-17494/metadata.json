    "abstract": "We consider the 1D Tonks-Girardeau gas with a space-dependent potential out of equilibrium. We derive the exact dynamics of the system when divided into $n$ boxes and decomposed into energy eigenstates within each box. It is a representation of the wave function that is mixed between real space and momentum space, whose basis elements are plane waves localized in a box, motivating the word ``wavelet\". In this representation we derive the emergence of generalized hydrodynamics in appropriate limits without assuming local relaxation. We emphasize in particular that a generalized hydrodynamic behaviour emerges in a high-density and short-time limit, besides the more common large-space and late-time limit, which is akin to a semi-classical expansion. Besides, we show that this wavelet representation provides an efficient numerical algorithm for a complete description of out-of-equilibrium dynamics of hardcore bosons.",

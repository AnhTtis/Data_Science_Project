    "abstract": "We present some more foundations for a theory of real structure in operator spaces and algebras, in particular concerning the real case of the theory of injectivity, and the injective, ternary, and $C^*$-envelope. We consider the interaction between these topics and the complexification. We also generalize many of these results to the setting of operator spaces and systems acted upon by a group.",

    "abstract": "We study the effect of the energy gap on the transmission of fermions in graphene exposed to linearly polarized light as a laser barrier. We determine the energy spectrum, apply boundary conditions at interfaces, and use the transfer matrix approach to obtain transmissions for all energy modes. We show that when the energy gap increases, the oscillations of transmissions decrease dramatically until they vanish entirely. However, when the barrier width varies, the oscillations become more significant and exhibit sharp peaks. By increasing the incident energy, the laser field suppresses the Fabry-Pérot resonance, and the transmissions move to the right when the energy gap is tuned.",

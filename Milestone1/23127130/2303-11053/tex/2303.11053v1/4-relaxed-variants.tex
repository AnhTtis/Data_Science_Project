\section{Algorithms for Model $1$}\label{sec:relaxed-variants}
%Network Flow diagrams. Approximation ratios. etc..
In this section, we show that the online algorithm Algorithm~\ref{alg:online-greedy} performs even better for the Model~1 with an improved competitive ratio of \(1+\delta\). We also show that the problem instance of Model~1 can be solved in polynomial time using flow networks.

\subsection{Optimal Offline Algorithm}

As in Model~1, when the \emph{overall quota} constraint is relaxed, the problem can be modelled as an instance of the minimum cost flow network. We define the minimum cost flow problem here for completeness. 

\paragraph{The minimum cost flow problem:} The input is a flow network $G=(V,E)$ as a directed graph with node set $V$, edge set $E$, capacities $c_e>0$ and cost $u_e\in \mathbb{R}$ on each edge $e\in E$, and a source $s$ and sink $t$. A flow $f:E\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a valid flow in $G$ if $f(e)\leq c(e)$, and the incoming flow at any node except $s$ and $t$ equals the outgoing flow. The cost of a flow $f(e)$ along an edge $e$ is
$u_e\cdot f(e)$. A minimum cost flow in the network is the one that minimizes the sum of costs of the flow along all edges.

There are polynomial-time algorithms known for the minimum cost flow problem. Also, it is known that if all the capacities are integers, then the optimum flow is an integer. We refer the reader to \cite{Ahuja93} for the details of minimum cost flow. 
\paragraph{Reduction: }
The construction of the flow network is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:flow-nw}. The flow network consists of a source $s$, a sink $t$, nodes for each day $d_j$, each agent $a_k$ and nodes $c_{ij}$ for each $(c_i,d_j)\in C\times D$. Each edge $(s,d_j)$ has capacity $s_j$ denoting the daily supply for day $d_j$, each edge $(d_j,c_{ij})$ has capacity equal to $q_{ij}$, and all other edges have capacity $1$. All the edges are directed. Additionally, each $(c_{ij},a_k)$ edge has cost $-u_k\cdot\delta_k^j$ whereas other edges have cost $0$.

\begin{proof}(of Theorem~\ref{thm:off-opt})
We show that a minimum cost flow $f$ in the flow network corresponds to a maximum utility matching in the given instance. The integrality of minimum cost flow implies that each edge incident on $t$ can have a flow of either $0$ or $1$. For each $k$, if $f(a_k,t)=1$, then 
there is exactly one $c_{ij}$ such that $f(c_{ij},a_k)=1$. Set $M(a_k)=(c_i,d_j)$ in the
corresponding matching $M$. Similarly, for any matching $M$, A corresponding flow  can be shown as follows. If $M(a_k)=(c_i,d_j)$ then set $f(a_k,t)=f(c_{ij},a_k)=1$, and set $f(s,d_j)$ equal to the number of agents vaccinated on day $d_j$, and $f(d_j,c_{ij})$ equal to the number of agents vaccinated on day $d_j$ through category $c_i$. It is clear that this is a valid flow in the network, and the negation of the cost of the flow is the same as the utility of the corresponding matching.

\subsection{Competitive Ratio}
It can be shown that Algorithm~\ref{alg:online-greedy} guarantees a competitive ratio of \(1+max_i\delta_i\) for Model~1.

\begin{theorem}
Algorithm~\ref{alg:online-greedy} is an \((1+\delta)\)- approximation for Model~1.  
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Similar to Section~\ref{sec:analysis-model-generic}, partition \(S_{OPT}\) to \(H_1\) and \(H_2\). Let \(H_1 \subseteq S_{OPT} \) be the set of agents who are vaccinated by the online algorithm at least one day before they are vaccinated by the optimal allocation. That is,
\begin{align*}
  H_1&=\{a\in S_{OPT} \mid OPT(a)=(c_i,d_j),\  ON(a)=(c_k,d_l), d_l<d_j\}
\end{align*}
For every agent \(a\in H_1\), \(a\) charges their own image \(a \in S_{ON}\). Therefore, by definition, no two agents in \(H_1\) charge the same agent and every agent in \(H_1\) charges exactly one agent in \(S_{ON}\).

Let \(S' = S_{OPT}\setminus H_1\) be the remaining agents from \(S_{OPT}\) who are not in \(H_1\).

Now, partition the agents in \(S'\) based on the day on which they got vaccinated by \(OPT\). That is, \[ S' = X_1\uplus X_2 \uplus \cdots \uplus X_{r=|D|} \]where,
\begin{align*}
  X_i &= \{a\in S' \mid a \text{ is vaccinated on day } d_i \text{ by } OPT  \} &&\forall_{i\in\{1,2,\cdots,|D|\}}\\
\end{align*}
Similarly let\[ S_{ON} = Y_1\uplus Y_2 \uplus \cdots \uplus Y_{r=|D|} \] where,
\begin{align*}
  Y_i &= \{a\in S_{ON} \mid a \text{ is vaccinated on day } d_i \text{ by } ON  \} &&\forall_{i\in\{1,2,\cdots,|D|\}}\\
\end{align*}

For each \(d_i \in D\), Since Algorithm~\ref{alg:online-greedy} greedily finds a maximum size b-matching of size at most \(s_i\), and since each edge in the b-matching corresponds to a unique agent, The set \(|X_i| \le |Y_i|\). Therefore, we can safely add the whole \(X_i\) to \(H_2\).  This is because we want the agents in \(X_i\) to charge the agents in \(Y_i\) with a charging factor of \(1\). Since  \(|X_i|\le|Y_i|\), we can choose any injective mapping from \(X_i\) to \(Y_i\) for this charging scheme.

Thus, each agent in \(S_{ON}\) is charged at most once by an agent in \(H_1\) with a factor of \(\delta\) and at most once by an agent in \(H_2\) with a factor of \(1\). Hence, Algorithm~\ref{alg:online-greedy} guarantees a competitive ratio of \(1+\delta\)

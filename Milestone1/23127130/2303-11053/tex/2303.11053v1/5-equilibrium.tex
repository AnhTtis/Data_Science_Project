\section{Strategy-proofness of the online algorithm}

In the previous sections, we considered the case when agents truthfully report their availability and categories. In this section, we look into the scenario when agents are strategic, and might misreport their availability and/or eligible categories. Agents have an incentive in doing so because they prefer obtaining the healthcare resource over not getting it. Further, an agent would prefer to obtain the resource as early as possible. Offline optimal algorithm is prone to such strategic manipulations.

The online algorithm is strategy-proof because, on any day $d_i$, it does not consider availability on future days. Hence if an agent hides his availability on day $d_i$, the agent does not benefit. We show that there is a pure Nash equilibrium in the offline setting such that the utility of the Nash equilibrium has the same value as that of the solution obtained by the online algorithm. Thus, in the presence of strategic agents, the online algorithm has the advantage over the offline algorithm that it avoids Nash equilibria with very low utility value. We give the details in Appendix.

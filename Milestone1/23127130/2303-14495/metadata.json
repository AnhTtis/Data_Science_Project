    "abstract": "In this work, we propose and study a preconditioned framework with a graphic Ginzburg-Landau functional for image segmentation and data clustering by parallel computing. Solving nonlocal models is usually challenging due to the huge computation burden. For the nonconvex and nonlocal variational functional, we propose several damped Jacobi and generalized Richardson preconditioners for the large-scale linear systems within a difference of convex functions algorithms framework. They are efficient for parallel computing with GPU and can leverage the computational cost. Our framework also provides flexible step sizes with a global convergence guarantee. Numerical experiments show the proposed algorithms are very competitive compared to the singular value decomposition based spectral method.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the molecular energies of many chemical systems have been successfully simulated on quantum computers, which is regarded as the killer application of quantum computing. Compared to molecular energy, however, reaction dynamics play a more fundamental role in practical application, especially in catalytic activity, material design. Limited the capabilities of the noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices, directly simulating the reaction dynamics and determining reaction pathway remain a challenge. Here, we employ the ab initio molecular dynamics based on the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm to simulate reaction dynamics by extending correlated sampling approach. Moreover, we also use this approach to calculate Hessian matrix and evaluate computation resources. We numerically test the approach by simulating hydrogen exchange reaction and bimolecular nucleophilic substitubion SN2 reaction. The test results suggest that it is reliable to characterize the molecular structues, properties, and reactivities, which is another important expansion of the application of quantum computing.",

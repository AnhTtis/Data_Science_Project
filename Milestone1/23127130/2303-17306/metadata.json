    "abstract": "Sidon spaces have been introduced by Bachoc, Serra and Zémor in 2017 as the $q$-analogue of Sidon sets. The interest on Sidon spaces has increased quickly, especially after the work of Roth, Raviv and Tamo in 2018, in which they highlighted the correspondence between Sidon spaces and cyclic subspace codes. Up to now, the known constructions of Sidon Spaces may be divided in three families: the ones contained in the sum of two multiplicative cosets of a fixed subfield of $\\mathbb{F}_{q^n}$, the ones contained in the sum of more than two multiplicative cosets of a fixed subfield of $\\mathbb{F}_{q^n}$ and finally the ones obtained as the kernel of subspace polynomials. In this paper we will mainly focus on the first class of examples, for which we provide characterization results and we will show some new examples, arising also from some well-known combinatorial objects. Moreover, we will give a quite natural definition of equivalence among Sidon spaces, which relies on the notion of equivalence of cyclic subspace codes and we will discuss about the equivalence of the known examples.",

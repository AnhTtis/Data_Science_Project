In this work, we introduced a novel occlusion-aware behavior modeling approach to infer the behavior of occluded agents from noise-corrupted observations of only observed agents. Our method recovers parameters of an underlying game model that best explains the observed trajectories and simultaneously computes open-loop Nash trajectories for both visible and occluded agents. We integrated our inference method with a contingency game planner which operates in a receding horizon fashion to make robot decisions in navigation tasks. Experimental results underscore our approach's advantage in providing accurate estimates of the game model and agents' trajectories over the occlusion-ignorant baseline. Meanwhile, our planning algorithm also outperforms a state-of-the-art but occlusion-ignorant baseline, revealing its potential for proactively avoiding collisions with occluded agents during navigation.

While our evaluation was conducted in simulated environments, our future research will focus on extending our approach to incorporate real sensor data, such as lidar and camera observations, for deployment in realistic urban traffic scenarios and social navigation. This evolution promises to enhance the feasibility of our method in real-world autonomous navigation and robotic systems.

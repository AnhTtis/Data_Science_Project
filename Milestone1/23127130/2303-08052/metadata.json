    "abstract": "Beamforming for multichannel speech enhancement relies on the estimation of spatial characteristics of the acoustic scene. In its simplest form, the delay-and-sum beamformer (DSB) introduces a time delay to all channels to align the desired signal components for constructive superposition. Recent investigations of neural spatiospectral filtering revealed that these filters can be characterized by a beampattern similar to one of traditional beamformers, which shows that artificial neural networks can learn and explicitly represent spatial structure. Using the Complex-valued Spatial Autoencoder (COSPA) as an exemplary neural spatiospectral filter for multichannel speech enhancement, we investigate where and how such networks represent spatial information. We show via clustering that for COSPA the spatial information is represented by the features generated by a gated recurrent unit (GRU) layer that has access to all channels simultaneously and that these features are not source -- but only direction of arrival-dependent.",

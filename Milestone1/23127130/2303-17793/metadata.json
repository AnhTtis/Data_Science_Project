    "abstract": "We view all smooth metrics $g$ on a closed surface $Σ$ through their Nash isometric embeddings $f_g: (Σ,g) \\rightarrow (\\mathbb{S}^{\\tilde{n}}, \\tilde{g})$ into a standard sphere of large, but fixed, dimension $\\tilde{n}$. We define the Willmore functional $\\mathcal{W}_{f_g}$ over this space of metrics on $Σ$ in terms of the extrinsic quantities of $f_g$. Its infimum over metrics in a conformal class is an invariant of the class varying differentiably with it. If $Σ$ is oriented of genus $k$, when $k=0$, we use the gap theorem of Simons to show that there is a unique conformal class of metrics on $Σ$, whose invariant $16π$ is the value for the standard totally geodesic embedding of $\\mathbb{S}^2 \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{S}^{\\tilde{n}}$, and we have that $\\mathcal{W}_{f_g}(Σ) \\geq 16π$, with the lower bound achieved if, and only if, $f_g$ is conformally equivalent to this standard geodesic embedding of $\\mathbb{S}^2$, and ${\\rm area}_g(Σ) \\leq 4π$, while when $k\\geq 1$, the Lawson minimal surface $(ξ_{k,1},g_{ξ_{k,1}})$ fixes the scale, and we show that $\\mathcal{W}_{f_g}(Σ) \\geq 4\\, {\\rm area}_{g_{ξ_{k,1}}} (ξ_{k,1})$, with the lower bound achieved by $f_g$ if, and only if, $f_g$ is conformally equivalent to $f_{g_{ξ_{k,1}}} : (ξ_{k,1}, g_{ξ_{k,1}}) \\rightarrow (\\mathbb{S}^3,\\tilde{g}) \\hookrightarrow (\\mathbb{S}^{\\tilde{n}},\\tilde{g})$, and ${\\rm area}_g(Σ)\\leq {\\rm area}_{g_{ξ_{k,1}}} (ξ_{k,1})$. For a nonoriented $Σ$, we prove a likewise estimate from below for $\\mathcal{W}_{f_g}(Σ)$, and characterize conformally the surface that realizes the optimal lower bound.",

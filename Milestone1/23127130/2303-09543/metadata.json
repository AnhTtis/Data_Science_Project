    "abstract": "The differential equation (DE) with proportional delay is a particular case of the time-dependent delay differential equation (DDE). In this paper, we solve non-linear DEs with proportional delay using the successive approximation method (SAM). We prove the existence, uniqueness of theorems, and stability for DEs with proportional delay using SAM. We derive convergence results for these equations by using the Lipschitz condition. We generalize these results to the fractional differential equations (FDEs) and system of FDEs containing Caputo fractional derivative. Further, we obtain the series solution of the pantograph equation and Ambartsumian equation in the form of a power series which are convergent for all reals. Finally, we illustrate the efficacy of the SAM by example. The results obtained by SAM are compared with exact solutions and other iterative methods. It is observed that SAM is simpler compared to other methods and the solutions obtained using SAM are consistent with the exact solution.",

    "abstract": "Let $S$ be a compact Hausdorff space and $X$ a complex manifold. We consider the space $C(S,X)$ of continuous maps $S\\to X$, and prove that any bounded holomorphic function on this space can be continued to a holomorphic function, possibly multivalued, on a larger space $B(S,X)$ of Borel maps. As an application we prove two theorems about bounded holomorphic functions on $C(S,X)$, one reminiscent of the Monodromy Theorem, the other of Liouville's Theorem.",

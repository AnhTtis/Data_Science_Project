    "abstract": "Beyond the two-dimensional (2D) saddle-point Van Hove singularities (VHSs) with logarithmic divergences in the density of states (DOS), recent studies have identified higher-order VHSs with faster-than-logarithmic divergences that can amplify electron correlation effects. Here we show that the cuprate high-Tc superconductors harbor high-order VHSs in their electronic spectra and unveil a new correlation that the cuprates with high-order VHSs display higher Tc. Our analysis indicates that the normal and higher-order VHSs can provide a straightforward new marker for identifying propensity of a material toward the occurrence of correlated phases such as excitonic insulators and supermetals. Our study opens up a new materials playground for exploring the interplay between high-order VHSs, superconducting transition temperatures and electron correlation effects in the cuprates and related high-Tc superconductors.",

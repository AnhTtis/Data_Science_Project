    "abstract": "In fixed budget bandit identification, an algorithm sequentially observes samples from several distributions up to a given final time. It then answers a query about the set of distributions. A good algorithm will have a small probability of error. While that probability decreases exponentially with the final time, the best attainable rate is not known precisely for most identification tasks. We show that if a fixed budget task admits a complexity, defined as a lower bound on the probability of error which is attained by a single algorithm on all bandit problems, then that complexity is determined by the best non-adaptive sampling procedure for that problem. We show that there is no such complexity for several fixed budget identification tasks including Bernoulli best arm identification with two arms: there is no single algorithm that attains everywhere the best possible rate.",

    "abstract": "Photoemission spectroscopy, an experimental method based on the photoelectric effect, is now an indispensable technique used in various fields such as materials science, life science, medicine, and nanotechnology. However, part of the experimental process of photoemission spectroscopy relies on experience and intuition, which is difficult to understand for novice users. In particular, photoemission spectroscopy experiments using high-brilliance synchrotron radiation as a light source are not easy for novice users because the measurements must be performed quickly and accurately as scheduled within a limited experimental period. In addition, research on the application of information science methods to quantum data measurement, such as photoemission spectroscopy, is mainly aimed at the development of analysis methods, and few attempts have been made to clarify the problems faced by users who lack experience. In this study, we identified the problems faced by novice users of photoemission spectroscopy, implemented a native application with functions to solve these problems, and evaluated it qualitatively and quantitatively. This paper describes the contents of the field study and interview survey, the functional design and implementation of the application based on our field study and interview survey, and the results and discussion of the evaluation experiment.",

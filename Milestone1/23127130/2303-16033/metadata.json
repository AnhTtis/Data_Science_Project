    "abstract": "Nanoscale molecular junctions are celebrated nanoelectronic devices for mimicking several electronic functions including rectifiers, sensors, wires, switches, transistors, and memory but capacitive behavior is nearly unexplored. Capacitors are crucial energy storage devices that store energy in the form of electrical charges. A capacitor utilizes two electrical conductors separated by a dielectric material. However, many oxides-based dielectrics are well-studied for integrating capacitors, however, capacitors comprised of thin-film molecular layers are not well-studied. The present work describes electrochemically grafted thin films of benzimidazole (BENZ) grown on patterned ITO electrodes on which a 50 nm Al is deposited to fabricate large-scale (500 x 500 micron2) molecular junctions. The nitrogen and sulfur-containing molecular junctions, ITO/BENZ/Al act as a parallel-plate capacitor with a maximum capacitance of ~59.6 to 4.79 microFcm-2. The present system can be an excellent platform for molecular charge storage for future energy applications.",

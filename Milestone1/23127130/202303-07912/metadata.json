    "abstract": "In this study, we prove rigourous bounds on the error and stability analysis\nof deep learning methods for the nonstationary Magneto-hydrodynamics equations.\nWe obtain the approximate ability of the neural network by the convergence of a\nloss function and the convergence of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to the exact\nsolution. Moreover, we derive explicit error estimates for the solution\ncomputed by optimizing the loss function in the DNN approximation of the\nsolution.",

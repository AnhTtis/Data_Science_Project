    "abstract": "Multi-robot exploration is a field which tackles the challenge of exploring a previously unknown environment with a number of robots. This is especially relevant for search and rescue operations where time is essential. Current state of the art approaches are able to explore a given environment with a large number of robots by assigning them to frontiers. However, this assignment generally favors large frontiers and hence omits potentially valuable medium-sized frontiers.\n  In this paper we showcase a novel multi-robot exploration algorithm, which improves and adapts the existing approaches. Through the addition of information gain based ranking we improve the exploration time for closed urban environments while maintaining similar exploration performance compared to the state-of-the-art for open environments. Accompanying this paper, we further publish our research code in order to lower the barrier to entry for further multi-robot exploration research. We evaluate the performance in three simulated scenarios, two urban and one open scenario, where our algorithm outperforms the state of the art by 5\\% overall.",

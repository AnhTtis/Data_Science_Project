    "abstract": "We assess two domain-specific languages included in the GridTools ecosystem as tools for implementing a high-order Discontinuous Galerkin discretization of the shallow water equations. Equations in spherical geometry are considered, thus providing a blueprint for the application of domain-specific languages to the development of global atmospheric models. The results demonstrate that domain-specific languages designed for finite difference/volume methods can be successfully extended to implement a Discontinuous Galerkin solver.",

  abstract = {The goal of this work is to obtain a family of explicit high order well-balanced methods for the shallow water equations in spherical coordinates. Application of shallow water models to large scale problems requires the use of spherical coordinates: this is the case, for instance, of the simulation of the propagation of a Tsunami wave through the ocean. Although the PDE system is similar to the shallow water equations in Cartesian coordinates, new source terms appear. As a consequence, the derivation of high order numerical methods that preserve water at rest solutions is not as straightforward as in that case. Finite Volume methods are considered based on a first order path-conservative scheme and high order reconstruction operators. Numerical methods based on these ingredients have been successfully applied previously to the nonlinear SWEs in Cartesian coordinates. Some numerical tests to check the well-balancing and high order properties of the scheme, as well as its ability to simulate planetary waves or tsunami waves over realistic bathymetries are presented.},

To overcome well known problems with polar singularities, we consider the shallow water equations in Cartesian coordinates, augmented with a Lagrange multiplier to ensure that fluid particles are constrained to the spherical surface. The global solutions are represented by a collection of curvilinear quadrilaterals from an icosahedral grid. On each of these elements the local solutions are assumed to be well approximated by a high-order nodal Lagrange polynomial, constructed from a tensor-product of the LegendreGauss-Lobatto points which also supplies a high-order quadrature. The shallow water equations are satisfied in a local discontinuous element fashion with solution continuity being enforced weakly. The numerical experiments, involving a comparison of weak and strong conservation forms as well as the impact of over-integration, confirm the expected high-order accuracy and the potential for using such highly parallel formulations in numerical weather prediction.},

The shallow water equations exhibit the major difficulties associated with the horizontal dynamical aspects of atmospheric modeling on the spherical earth. These cases are designed for use in the evaluation of numerical methods proposed for climate modeling and to identify the potential trade-offs which must always be made in numerical modeling. Before a proposed scheme is applied to a full baroclinic atmospheric model it must perform well on these problems in comparison with other currently accepted numerical methods. The cases are presented in order of complexity. They consist of advection across the poles, steady state geostrophically balanced flow of both global and local scales, forced nonlinear advection of an isolated low, zonal flow impinging on an isolated mountain, Rossby-Haurwitz waves, and observed atmospheric states. One of the cases is also identified as a computer performance/algorithm efficiency benchmark for assessing the performance of algorithms adapted to massively parallel computers.}

  abstract = {Abstract The more attractive one dimensional, shape-preserving interpolation schemes as determined from a companion study are applied to two-dimensional semi-Lagrangian advection in plane and spherical geometry. Hermite cubic and a rational cubic are considered for the interpolation form. Both require estimates of derivatives at data points. A cubic derivative form and the derivative estimates of Hyman and Akima are considered. The derivative estimates are also modified to ensure that the interpolant is monotonic. The modification depends on the interpolation form. Three methods are used to apply the interpolators to two-dimensional semi-Lagrangian advection. The first consists of fractional time steps or time splitting. The method has noticeable displacement errors and larger diffusion than the other methods. The second consists of two-dimensional interpolants with formal definitions of a two-dimensional monotonic surface and application of a two-dimensional monotonicity constraint. This approach is examined for the Hermite cubic interpolant with cubic derivative estimates and produces very good results. The additional complications expected in extending to it three dimensions and the lack of corresponding two-dimensional forms for the rational cubic led to the consideration of the third approach—a tensor product form of monotonic one-dimensional interpolants. Although a description of the properties of the implied interpolating surface is difficult to obtain, the results show this to be a viable approach. Of the schemes considered, the Hermic cubic coupled with the Akima derivative estimate modified to satisfy a C0monotonicity condition produces the best solution to our test cases. The C1monotonic forms of the Hermite cubic have serious differential phase errors that distort the test patterns. The C1 forms of the rational cubic do not show this distortion and produce virtually the same solutions as the corresponding C0forms. The second best scheme (or best C1 continuity is desired) is the rational cubic with Hyman derivative approximations modified to satisfy C1 monotonicity condition. The two-dimensional interpolants are easily applied to spherical geometry using the natural polar boundary conditions. No problems are evident in advecting test shapes over the poles. A procedure is also introduced to calculate the departure point in spherical geometry. The scheme uses local geodesic coordinate systems based on each arrival point. It is shown to be comparable in accuracy to the one proposed Ritchie, which uses a Cartesian system in place of the local geodesic system.},

To maintain performance portability in the future, it is imperative to decouple architecture-specific programming paradigms from the underlying scientific computations. We present the Stateful DataFlow multiGraph (SDFG), a data-centric intermediate representation that enables separating program definition from its optimization. By combining fine-grained data dependencies with high-level control-flow, SDFGs are both expressive and amenable to program transformations, such as tiling and double-buffering. These transformations are applied to the SDFG in an interactive process, using extensible pattern matching, graph rewriting, and a graphical user interface. We demonstrate SDFGs on CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs over various motifs --- from fundamental computational kernels to graph analytics. We show that SDFGs deliver competitive performance, allowing domain scientists to develop applications naturally and port them to approach peak hardware performance without modifying the original scientific code.},

ABSTRACT = {In the last years, the energy efficiency of HPC systems is increasingly becoming of paramount importance for environmental, technical, and economical reasons. Several projects have investigated the use of different processors and accelerators in the quest of building systems able to achieve high energy efficiency levels for data centers and HPC installations. In this context, Arm CPU architecture has received a lot of attention given its wide use in low-power and energy-limited applications, but server grade processors have appeared on the market just recently. In this study, we targeted the Marvell ThunderX2, one of the latest Arm-based processors developed to fit the requirements of high performance computing applications. Our interest is mainly focused on the assessment in the context of large HPC installations, and thus we evaluated both computing performance and energy efficiency, using the ERT benchmark and two HPC production ready applications. We finally compared the results with other processors commonly used in large parallel systems and highlight the characteristics of applications which could benefit from the ThunderX2 architecture, in terms of both computing performance and energy efficiency. Pursuing this aim, we also describe how ERT has been modified and optimized for ThunderX2, and how to monitor power drain while running applications on this processor.},

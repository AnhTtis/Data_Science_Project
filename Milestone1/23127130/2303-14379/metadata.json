    "abstract": "We present a JT gravity set up in the presence of projected ModMax corrections in two dimensions. Our starting point is the Einstein's gravity in four dimensions accompanied by the ModMax Lagrangian. The 2D gravity action is obtained following a suitable dimensional reduction which contains a 2D image of the 4D ModMax Lagrangian. We carry out a perturbative analysis to find out the vacuum structure of the theory which asymptotes to $AdS_2$ in the absence of $U(1)$ gauge fields. We calculate the holographic central charge and obtain the bound on the ModMax parameter by demanding the positivity of the central charge. We also find out ModMax corrected 2D black hole solutions and discuss their extremal limits.",

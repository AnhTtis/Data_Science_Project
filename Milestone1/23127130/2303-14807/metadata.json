    "abstract": "We develop a new method to study intersection theory of the main component of the Hilbert scheme of points on complex manifolds. The main result is an iterated residue formula for tautological integrals. We formulate a Chern-Segre-type positivity conjecture for these integrals, and we introduce higher dimensional Segre and Chern integrals.",

    "abstract": "A family of sets has the $(p, q)$ property if among any $p$ members of it some $q$ intersect. It is shown that if a finite family of compact convex sets in $\\R^2$ has the $(p+1,2)$ property then it is pierced by $\\lfloor \\frac{p}{2} \\rfloor +1$ lines. A colorful version of this result is proved as well. As a corollary, the following is proved: Let $\\F$ be a finite family of compact convex sets in the plane with no isolated sets, and let $\\F'$ be the family of its pairwise intersections. If $\\F$ has the $(p+1,2)$ property and $\\F'$ has the $(r+1,2)$ property, then $\\F$ is pierced by $(\\lfloor \\frac{r}{2} \\rfloor ^2 +\\lfloor\\frac{r}{2} \\rfloor)p$ points when $r\\ge 2$, and by $p$ points otherwise. The proofs use the topological KKM theorem.",

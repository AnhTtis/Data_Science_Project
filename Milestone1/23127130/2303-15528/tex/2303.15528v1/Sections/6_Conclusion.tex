In this work, we propose a novel domain adaptation method for low-light raw image enhancement using only a few labeled samples from the target domain and many source domain samples. We first extract camera-specific information through separate encoders, and then use a shared enhancement network ($\mathbb{N}$) to extract domain invariant features and transfer the task successfully from the source domain to the target domain. We propose to compute post-processed image loss for the source domain to have less influence on predictions in the target domain. We also present a new labeled raw image dataset captured with a Nikon camera. Our results show that using only a few labeled samples from the target domain is sufficient to obtain similar or better results than training with large target domain data. We hope that our method and dataset inspire new investigations along these research directions. 

% Then, we use a shared enhancement network to perform denoising, color enhancement, and demosaicing together for both the source and target domains. % the research community to further

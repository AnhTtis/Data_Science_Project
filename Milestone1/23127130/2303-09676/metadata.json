    "abstract": "Let $V$ be a finite abelian group of odd order, equipped with a non-degenerate, alternating form $ω\\colon V\\times V \\to \\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z}$. We give closed formulas for the character values of the Weil representation associated with $(V,ω)$. These formulas generalize the ones given by S. Gurevich and R. Hadani (2007) and by T. Thomas (2008, 2013) from finite vector spaces to abelian groups. Our formulas do not involve the choice of a Lagrangian subgroup of $V$. Our proofs are based on an elementary algebraic approach introduced by H. N. Ward (1972, 2017) for finite vector spaces over fields.",

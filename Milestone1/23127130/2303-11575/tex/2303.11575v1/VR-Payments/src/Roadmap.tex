% In the following sections, we report our findings that answer the research questions respectively. We first report the interaction experiences participants perceived in the task and the factors that contribute to such experiences. These factors include \TODOS{XXX}. Second, we analyze how these experiences influence users’ perception of authentication, including security and privacy. Our thematic analysis reveals that \TODOS{XXX}. Last, we summarize users’ expectations of adopting interactive authentication in VR. We center our results around the content analysis on participants’ responses, and we use statistics, e.g., users’ rating on perceived security, to support our analysis.

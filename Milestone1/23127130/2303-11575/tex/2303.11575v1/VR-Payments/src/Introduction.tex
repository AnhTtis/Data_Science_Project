\section{Introduction}




Virtual reality (VR) systems immerse individuals in a digital world, one that simulates real-world interactions with objects and characters~\cite{burdea-vrt03}.
In addition to specialized use cases (e.g., military training and healthcare~\cite{rizzo-jcpms11}), VR technology is seeing widespread adoption in more routine settings, such as gaming, social interactions, shopping, and commerce~\cite{freeman-cscw21,speicher-imwut17,hock-chi17}. 
We are already in the early phase of a VR commerce boom, where service providers, such as retailers and banks, are creating virtual branches to serve users in popular VR worlds~\cite{lau_2022}.

VR systems access sensitive user data and assets, raising the need to authenticate users, especially for payment scenarios that empower the VR commerce boom~\cite{lau_2022}. VR service providers deploy user authentication methods borrowed from traditional platforms to verify users' identities, such as using passwords and personal identification numbers (PINs). However, there is limited understanding of how users perceive user authentication in VR, especially \textbf{how users’ interaction experience factors into their security and privacy perception of authentication in VR}. Recent research has shown that the context in which authentication is used (e.g., where and for what purpose) affects users' security and privacy perception. For example, users feel insecure when using an ATM in a crowded space~\cite{mathis-vr22}. VR presents a unique context where users interact with digital objects to perform routine activities, such as payment, which were once limited to conventional platforms. There is a need to understand how users perceive the security and privacy properties of payment authentication in the growing VR commerce ecosystem. With such understanding, we can guide the future design of authentication methods that are both secure and usable. Our paper provides this understanding by investigating the following research questions.


\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]

\item \textbf{RQ1 -- Interaction Experience:} What are the factors that contribute to users’ interaction experience of authentication in VR, and how?
\item \textbf{RQ2 -- Security and Privacy Perception:} How does users' interaction experience, in regards to the above factors, affect users’ security and privacy perceptions of authentication in VR?
\item \textbf{RQ3 -- Meeting User Expectations:} How can we meet users’ expectations on VR authentication that improve interaction experience, security, and privacy?

\end{itemize}


To answer these questions, we leverage \textit{technology probes}~\cite{hutchinson-chi03}, a method that leverages proof-of-concept interfaces to uncover hidden phenomena in user interaction, to study user authentication in VR. We designed four probes pertaining to authentication interactions in VR -- entering a PIN, tapping a virtual card, and signing a signature -- to evaluate of the user interaction experience and perceived security and privacy. 
These probes follow three interaction paradigms of authentication using something you know (e.g., PIN), something you have (e.g., token), and something you are (e.g., biometrics)~\cite{ross-nist19}. They resemble existing authentication mechanisms in both VR and the physical world~\cite{mathis-vr22}. 
We embed these probes in a routine payment interaction for users when they play a VR archery game, which is an ecologically valid context.


We conducted a user study with 24 participants and evaluated their experiences in the VR game with the probes. We qualitatively analyzed open-ended responses from the participants, which include 312 statements.  Our analysis is also supported by quantitative ratings, e.g., the overall usability of our designs.

Our analysis reveals these findings in response to the three research questions:
\begin{itemize} [noitemsep]
\item \textbf{RQ1:} Participants' interaction experiences with VR authentication were associated with multiple factors, including the usability characteristics of authentication. When participants adapted their real-world authentication experiences in performing VR authentication, some interaction factors in VR, such as participants' motion control and spatial awareness, posed unique usability challenges.

\item \textbf{RQ2:} Participants benefited from the realistic interactions in VR authentication in translating real-world perception of authentication into VR. However, participants faced the gap due to usability issues in VR, e.g., losing the sense of signing their signature. Also, the gamified VR context may reduce participants' sensitivity to security and privacy.  

\item \textbf{RQ3:} Participants’ expectations for VR authentication centered around improving the interaction factors, e.g., making the interface more engaging. Although their expectations were sometimes nonspecific and even appeared conflicting, e.g., the need for receiving feedback and a reduced interaction burden.


\end{itemize}


Based on our findings, we propose several recommendations to accommodate participants’ expectations for VR authentication, further resolving the gaps and conflicts. To reduce the uncertainties from the environment of VR authentication, we suggest service providers not only inform users but provide active access control to mitigate threats, e.g., an invisible phishing interface. Further, engaging interface designs can motivate users to understand the security properties of authentication. In addition, we discuss the open challenges and opportunities in implementing these recommendations, e.g., identifying the responsibility among stakeholders in VR and payment ecosystems.

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item RQ1 [Interaction Experience]: What are the factors that influence users’ interaction experiences in authentication, and how?
%     \item RQ2 [Perception of Authentication]: How do these interaction factors interplay with users’ perception of authentication?

% \subsubsection*{Contributions}
% To answer these questions, we conducted a \textit{technology probe} study for payment authentication in VR~\cite{hutchinson-chi03}.
% We designed a VR game of an archery competition with a trading system as the primary context.
% For ecological validity, we further grounded our study participants by associating their in-game credits with a physical reward.
% Under the context of paying in the game, we evaluated how users perceive different interactions when authenticating to pay. 
% As a technology probe, we designed four types of authentication interactions: (1) an eco-centric PIN pad (following users' viewpoint), (2) an exo-centric PIN pad (presenting on the payment kiosk), (3) tap-to-pay, and (4) signature-to-pay.
% These interactions are paradigms of existing authentication interactions in VR and the physical world, also carrying an interface metaphor.

% \begin{itemize}
%     %{Study Setup - Deployment of payment methods in VR}
%     \item  We designed four authentication mechanisms for payments in VR that mimic physical world payment interactions (cf. \Cref{sec:authenticationinteractions}): PIN input (2 variants), card tapping, and signature.

% \subsection*{Summary of Findings}
% \TODOS{It's outdated here. Please see the key findings in Discussion}
% \paragraph{RQ1: Users' Perception of Security}
% From our user study, we observe that users' perception of authentication security in VR is affected by a myriad of factors, including users' experience and interaction in VR, their threat model for authentication in VR, their understanding and expectation of authentication systems, and last the context of payment.

% Meanwhile, decent realism made users more aware of the security  in VR.
% \paragraph{RQ2: Users' Perception on Usability}
% The gap between the authentication in VR and the real world affects the system's usability, further reducing user's perception of security.
% For example, the difficulties of signing in VR made participant feel the signature less personal.


% However, good usability is not necessarily tied to good security  perception -- a seamless authentication may make users feel insecure.

% \paragraph{RQ3: Adoption of Authentication Methods}


% We also investigated the usability issues and how users factored them into adoption reasoning along with their perceived security. 
% We found that users still consider the security  at odds to its usability.

% \TODOS{Be explicit about what experience and specifically what we want noticed instead of: 'We mark that users' security  perception is entangled with their user experience.'} 
% Nonetheless, we observed several opportunities in VR to preserve security  along with usability for the users, including leveraging the VR interface for better transparency and engagement in using the authentication service.

% % Last, we discussion the implications and provide recommendations to.......

    "abstract": "The Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (M-MIMO) is considered as one of the key technologies in 5G, and future 6G networks. From the perspective of, e.g., channel estimation, especially for high-speed users it is easier to implement an M-MIMO network exploiting a static set of beams, i.e., Grid of Beams (GoB). While considering GoB it is important to properly assign users to the beams, i.e., to perform Beam Management (BM). BM can be enhanced by taking into account historical knowledge about the radio environment, e.g., to avoid radio link failures. The aim of this paper is to propose such a BM algorithm, that utilizes location-dependent data stored in a Radio Environment Map (REM). It utilizes received power maps, and user mobility patterns to optimize the BM process in terms of Reinforcement Learning (RL) by using the Policy Iteration method under different goal functions, e.g., maximization of received power or minimization of beam reselections while avoiding radio link failures. The proposed solution is compliant with the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture, enabling its practical implementation. Simulation studies have shown that the proposed BM algorithm can significantly reduce the number of beam reselections or radio link failures compared to the baseline algorithm.",

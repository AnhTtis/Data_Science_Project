    "abstract": "Balanced and swap-robust minimal trades, introduced in [1], are important for studying the balance and stability of server access request protocols under data popularity changes. Constructions of such trades have so far relied on paired sets obtained through iterative combining of smaller sets that have provable stability guarantees, coupled with exhaustive computer search. Currently, there exists a nonnegligible gap between the resulting total dynamic balance discrepancy and the known theoretical lower bound. We present both new upper and lower bounds on the total service requests discrepancy under limited popularity changes. Our constructive near-optimal approach uses a new class of paired graphs whose vertices are two balanced sets with edges (arcs) that capture the balance and potential balance changes induced by limited-magnitude popularity changes (swaps).",

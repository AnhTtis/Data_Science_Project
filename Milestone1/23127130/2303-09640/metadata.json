    "abstract": "The main result of this article characterizes the set of semiclassical measures corresponding to sequences of eigenfunctions of the hydrogen atom. In particular, any Radon probability measure on the fixed negative energy surface $Σ_E$ that is invariant under the Hamiltonian flow is a semiclassical measure of a sequence of eigenfunctions of hydrogen. We first prove that there is a sequence of eigenfunctions, called hydrogen coherent states, that converge to a delta measure concentrating on any given geodesic $γ$ on $Σ_E$, and we finish using a density argument in the weak-* topology.",

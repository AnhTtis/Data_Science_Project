\begin{abstract}
Moons orbiting exoplanets (``exomoons'') may hold clues about planet formation, migration, and habitability. We investigate the plausibility of exomoons orbiting the temperate ($T_\text{eq}=294$ K) giant ($R = 9.2$ \Rearth) planet \HIP. Previous studies have suggested that \HIP~has a low apparent bulk density of $0.09\,\text{g}\,\text{cm}^{-3}$ and a flat near-infrared transmission spectrum, suggesting that it may possess circumplanetary rings. Given the planet's long orbital period ($P\approx1.5$ yr), it may also host a large exomoon. Here, we consider a hypothetical exomoon orbiting \HIP~with the same satellite-to-planet mass ratio as the Moon-Earth system and assess its orbital stability using a suite of N-body and tidal migration simulations. We find that satellites up to this size are largely stable against Hill sphere escape and collisions with the host planet, consistent with theoretical stability limits determined by previous studies. We then simulate the expected transit signal from the exomoon and show that current transit observations likely cannot constrain the presence of exomoons orbiting \HIP, though future observations may be capable of detecting exomoons in other systems. Finally, we simulate the combined transmission spectrum of \HIP~and an exomoon with a low-metallicity atmosphere, and show that the total effective spectrum is contaminated at the $\sim$10 ppm level. Our work not only demonstrates the feasibility of exomoons orbiting \HIP, but also shows that large exomoons may be a source of uncertainty in future high-precision measurements of exoplanet systems.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

The discovery and characterization of extrasolar moons (i.e., ``exomoons'') will play an important role in developing a more complete understanding of planetary systems. As remnants of planet formation, moons may provide useful information about the formation and evolution of exoplanets \citep[e.g.,][]{Sasaki+2010, Heller+2014_review, Spalding+2016, Ronnet+2018}. Moon-planet interactions may also be crucial for the long-term stability of exoplanet habitability; for example, moons may stabilize planetary obliquity \citep{Laskar+1993, Lissauer+2012} and drive tidal heating \citep[e.g.,][]{Piro+2018}, thereby significantly affecting planetary climate. Moreover, sufficiently heated exomoons may themselves be capable of hosting life, providing an alternative path to habitability beyond conventional habitable-zone terrestrial planets \citep[e.g.,][]{Heller+Barnes_2013, Heller+2014_review}.

Despite the large number of confirmed exoplanets surveyed to date ($>5,000$), there has yet to be a confirmed detection of an exomoon, largely due to the minuscule signals that putative moons imprint on measurements of their exoplanet hosts. Though tentative evidence for exomoons has recently been claimed \citep{Teachey+2018_nature, Kipping+2022}, robustly detecting exomoons is likely beyond the reach of current technology. Nonetheless, theoretical constraints on exomoon formation and evolution can provide valuable insight into plausible satellite-hosting exoplanets, and aide in the interpretation of future high-precision observations. For example, numerical N-body simulations have set limits on exomoon eccentricities and semi-major axes that are plausibly stable over a long timescales \citep[e.g.,][]{Domingos+2006, Payne+2013, Rosario-Franco+2020AJ}. Moreover, the tidal interactions between a moon, planet, and host star can result in the radial migration of the moon, leading to its eventual escape from the system or tidal disruption by the planet \citep[e.g.,][]{Barnes+OBrien_2002, Sasaki+2012, Sasaki+Barnes_2014, Piro+2018, Quarles+2020, Jagtap+2021}.

In this work, we investigate the plausibility of exomoons orbiting the temperate low-mass Jovian planet \HIP. HIP\,41378 is a bright ($V \approx 8.9$), slightly evolved late F-type star \citep[$T_\text{eff}=6320$ K, $\log g = 4.294$, $\text{[Fe/H]} = -0.10$, $M_\star = 1.16$ \Msun;][]{Santerne+2019} hosting five known transiting exoplanets \citep{Vanderburg+2016_hip, Berardo+2019}. The system was initially observed over the course of about 75 days during Campaign 5 (C5) of the extended \textit{Kepler} mission \citep[K2;][]{Borucki+2010, Howell+2014}, after which the two innermost planets were classified as sub-Neptunes ($R_\text{p,b} \approx 2.9$ \Rearth, $R_\text{p,c} \approx 2.6$ \Rearth) orbiting in a near 2:1 resonance at approximately 15.6 and 31.7 days \citep{Vanderburg+2016_hip}. However, only single transits were initially observed for the three outer planets ($R_\text{p,d} \approx 4.0$ \Rearth, $R_\text{p,e} \approx 5.5$ \Rearth, $R_\text{p,f} \approx 10$ \Rearth), and hence their orbital periods and ephemerides could not be well constrained \citep{Vanderburg+2016_hip}.

More precise limits on the orbits of planets d and f were later derived after one additional transit was observed for each planet during C18 of the K2 mission \citep{Becker+2019, Berardo+2019}. A subsequent third transit observation of planet f with the ground-based Next Generation Transit Survey \citep[NGTS;][]{Wheatley+2018MNRAS} confirmed its orbital period and suggested the presence of transit timing variations \citep[TTVs;][]{Bryant+2021}. Furthermore, radial velocity monitoring of the host star over hundreds of epochs was used to constrain the masses of all of the planets in the system, providing new insights into their physical properties. \citet{Santerne+2019} conducted a joint analysis using the two campaigns of K2 photometry together with 464 epochs of radial velocity measurements from the HARPS, HARPS-N, HIRES, and PFS spectrographs, and reported updated planet radii, masses, bulk densities, and orbital parameters for the five transiting planets, as well as a tentative detection of a sixth non-transiting planet. However, we note that an updated analysis of the data likely rules out the hypothesis of a tentative sixth planet in the HIP\,41378 system (A. Santerne, private communication). A summary of the most recent planet parameters from \citet{Santerne+2019} is shown in Table \ref{tab:planets}\footnote{An additional transit of \HIP~was observed in November 2022 by a coordinated ground-based effort.}.

The largest and outermost planet in the system, \HIP, orbits near the inner edge of the system's habitable zone with a period of about $1.5$ years. Mysteriously, the planet has an inferred radius of 9.2 \Rearth~but it has a mass of only 12 \Mearth, making it one of the lowest bulk density planets currently known \citep[$\rho = 0.09 \,\text{g}\,\text{cm}^{-3}$;][]{Santerne+2019}. It has been proposed that such low bulk densities in exoplanets could be explained by atmospheric outflows entraining optically thick photochemical hazes, which act to increase the planet's apparent radius in transit \citep{Ohno+2021, Gao+zhang_2020, Wang+Dai_2019ApJ}. However, this mechanism may not be compatible with \HIP~because of the planet's relatively high mass and cool equilibrium temperature \citep[e.g., see Equation 34 of][]{Ohno+2021}. Moreover, \citet{Belkovski+2022} showed that \HIP~would require a very high envelope mass fraction ($\gtrsim 75\%$) to remain in hydrostatic balance, in tension with the core accretion paradigm of planet formation.

An alternative explanation for \HIP's apparently low density is that the planet itself is significantly smaller, but is accompanied by a system of optically thick circumplanetary rings \citep{Zuluaga+2015ApJ, Akinsanmi+2020, Piro+Vissapragada_2020}. Such a ring system, if viewed at sufficiently high inclination, would effectively increase the observed transit depth while allowing the planet to have a bulk density more typical of sub-Neptunes. For example, \citet{Akinsanmi+2020} demonstrated that observations of \HIP~are consistent with a  3.7 \Rearth~($\rho = 1.2 \,\text{g}\,\text{cm}^{-3}$) planet with opaque rings extending from 1.05 to 2.6 planet radii. In addition, the presence of optically thick rings potentially causes a featureless transmission spectrum \citep{Ohno+2022,Ohno+22b}. Interestingly, our recent observations of \HIP~taken with the Widefield Camera 3 (WFC3) aboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) reveal a featureless near-infrared ($1.1-1.7$ $\mu$m) transmission spectrum \citep[HST-GO Program 16267;][]{Alam+2022}. Within the precision of these observations, we currently cannot distinguish between circumplanetary rings ($\chi_r^2 \approx 1.03$), high-altitude photochemical hazes ($\chi_r^2 \approx 0.97$), or a high-metallicity atmosphere ($\chi_r^2 \approx 1.84$). Future spectral observations at mid-infrared wavelengths (e.g., with JWST/MIRI) may be able to distinguish between these scenarios \citep{Alam+2022}.

The possibility of a circumplanetary ring system around \HIP~naturally raises the question of whether the planet could also host moons. For example, some studies suggest that rings are originally formed from moons \citep[e.g.,][]{Canup+2010}, or vice verse \citep[e.g.,][]{Crida+Sharnoz2012}. Because the Hill radius scales linearly with the distance of a planet from its host star, \HIP's large separation from its host star relative to the population of hot Jupiters ($P \lesssim 10$ d) makes it a favorable environment for exomoons. In addition, moons are ubiquitous in the outer Solar System. Moreover, while \HIP~itself is likely not habitable due to its high gas fraction, its temperate orbital separation poses the possibility that it hosts habitable exomoons. We note that the habitability of icy moons in the outer Solar System is still an open question. Though the detailed level of characterization required to assess exomoon habitability, or even confirm exomoon detections at all, is beyond current instrumental sensitivity, it may be prudent to consider the extent to which the presence of exomoons could manifest as a source of uncertainty in measurements of cool gaseous exoplanets, especially as we look toward future high-precision facilities such as ground-based ELTs and large space-based UV/optical/IR observatories \citep[e.g.,][]{Dalba+2015, LUVOIR_2019arXiv}.

Here we assess the stability of exomoons orbiting \HIP~using a suite of numerical N-body simulations and models of tidal evolution. Then, from the results of our stability analysis, we simulate the observable impact of a large exomoon on the white light curve and infrared transmission spectrum of \HIP. The rest of this paper is organized as follow: in Section \ref{sec:methods} we describe our theoretical methods used to constrain the allowable range of parameters for a stable moon orbiting \HIP. In Section \ref{sec:results_disc}, we present the results from our analysis and discuss the future observational implications. We conclude with a summary in Section \ref{sec:conclusion}.

\section{Methods} \label{sec:methods}

We first consider whether it is feasible that \HIP~could host an exomoon over the system's lifetime. Here we outline a theoretical approach to investigating this possibility. First, we apply a suite of dynamical simulations to assess the long-term orbital stability of satellites around \HIP. We then separately consider the effects of tidal friction on the orbits of satellites and whether tidal migration can further destabilize the system. Throughout this section, we assume that \HIP~has properties consistent with measurements from \citet{Santerne+2019}, and we do not self-consistently include circumplanetary rings in our simulations.

\subsection{N-body Simulations}\label{sec:methods:nbody}

\subsubsection{Three-body Simulation}

Because HIP\,41378 is a multiplanet system, gravitational interactions between neighboring planets may affect the long-term stability of a satellite orbiting planet f. Before considering the effects of additional planets, we start with an idealized three-body system in which we only consider one satellite orbiting planet f, in orbit around a central star. To simulate the dynamical evolution of the system, we use the \texttt{REBOUND} N-body code \citep{rebound} and the 15th order ``IAS15'' integrator with adaptive time stepping \citep{reboundias15}.

In our simulations, we fix the stellar mass and the mass and semi-major axis of planet f to the values from \citet{Santerne+2019}, provided in Table \ref{tab:planets}. Given a vast range of possible satellite configurations and properties, which would be computationally prohibited to fully explore, we chose to consider a satellite with the largest satellite-to-planet mass ratio observed in the Solar System (i.e., the Moon-Earth system). This choice allows us to explore a physically motivated scenario that maximizes the potential signal produced by the satellite---larger satellites may be exceedingly rare, based on the population of hundreds of moons in the Solar System, and smaller moons are far less likely to be detected. Therefore, as an extreme case, we consider a satellite of \HIP~with a mass of $M_\text{s} = 0.15$~\Mearth~to be consistent with the satellite-to-planet mass ratio for the Earth-Moon system ($M_\text{M}/M_\oplus \approx 0.0123$). We prescribe the satellite an Earth-like rocky composition ($\rho_\text{s} = 5.5 \,\text{g cm}^{-3}$), yielding a radius of $R_\text{s} = 0.53$~\Rearth~(approximately the size of Mars).

For simplicity, the moon is initiated on a circular, prograde orbit around planet f, then, following the results of previous studies estimating stability limits of hierarchical systems \citep[e.g.,][]{Rosario-Franco+2020AJ, Quarles+2021AJ, Jagtap+2021}, each simulation is run for a duration of up to $10^5$ yr. A simulation is halted and flagged as ``unstable'' if either of the following criteria are met: (1) the satellite collides with the planet, or (2) the satellite escapes the gravitational influence of the planet by crossing outside of the planet's Hill radius, given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:hill}
    R_\text{H} = a_\text{p} \bigg( \frac{M_\text{p}}{3 M_\star} \bigg)^{1/3} ,
\end{equation}
where $a_\text{p}$ is the planet's semi-major axis, and $M_\text{p}$ and $M_\star$ are the masses of the planet and star, respectively.

Following the results from \citet{Domingos+2006} and \citet{Rosario-Franco+2020AJ}, we vary the initial eccentricity, $e_\text{f}$, of planet f from 0.0 to 0.5 in increments of 0.01, and the initial semi-major axis $a_\text{s}$ of the satellite from 0.25 to 0.55$R_\text{H}$ in intervals of 0.006$R_\text{H}$, where $R_\text{H}$ is the Hill radius defined in Equation \ref{eq:hill} ($R_\text{H} \approx 0.03$ AU $\approx 76 R_\text{p}$). These limits were chosen in order to explore the parameter space around the stability limit determined by \citet{Rosario-Franco+2020AJ}. Note that the measured eccentricity of planet f is constrained to $e_\text{f} = 0.004_{-0.003}^{+0.009}$ \citep{Santerne+2019}. The planet and satellite are initialized with co-planar orbits, with the longitudes of the ascending node and arguments of pericenter set to zero ($\Omega = \omega = 0^\circ$), and the mean anomaly of the planet set to zero ($\mathcal{M}_\text{f} = 0^\circ$). 

Then, for each prescribed $(e_\text{f}, a_\text{s})$ pair, we determine the fractional stability of the system, $f_\text{stab}$, to quantify quasi-stable regions of parameter space. To do this, we run a set of 20 independent trials \citep[e.g.,][]{Rosario-Franco+2020AJ, Jagtap+2021} with the same $e_\text{f}$ and $a_\text{s}$, each with a randomly drawn satellite mean anomaly $\mathcal{M}_\text{s}$ from a uniform distribution between $0^\circ$ and $360^\circ$ (see Table \ref{tab:distributions}). Then $f_\text{stab}$ is the fraction of trials which satisfy our stability criteria. 

\subsubsection{Four-body Simulation}

Following our fiducial three-body simulations with a single planet, we run an additional grid of N-body simulations including the second-outermost planet in the system (HIP\,41378\,\,e). To simplify the problem and reduce computation time, we do not include planet b ($P=15.57$ d), planet c ($P=31.71$ d), or planet d ($P=278.36$ d) in our simulations. For our purpose of studying the stability of a satellite around planet f, this is a valid assumption given that the force of gravity on planet f due to the three inner planets at closest approach is orders of magnitude smaller than that of planet e. Moreover, the transit timing variations of planet f are dominated by a 2:3 resonance with planet e \citep{Bryant+2021}.

For this case, our setup is similar to that of our initial suite of simulations, but we now evaluate the fractional stability of the system as a function of planet e's orbital period, $P_\text{e}$, and eccentricity, $e_\text{e}$. To account for observational uncertainties in the masses and orbits of planets e and f, we randomly select parameters that are consistent with the results of \citet{Santerne+2019} and relax the assumption of coplanarity. For each trial simulation we randomly draw the mass, argument of pericenter, and inclination of planets e and f, and the period and eccentricity of planet f from normal distributions with standard deviations consistent with the uncertainties given in Table \ref{tab:planets}. 

For the satellite of planet f, we assume a circular orbit and randomly draw the cosine of the inclination (with respect to the planet's orbital plane) from a uniform distribution between $-1$ and $+1$, and the initial semi-major axis between 0.1 and 0.4$R_\text{H}$ (i.e., within the stability limits for a low-eccentricity host planet derived from our three-body simulations). We assume the same fixed stellar mass and satellite mass as before, and initialize each object with a random mean anomaly between $0^\circ$ and $360^\circ$. A summary of the distributions used to select parameters for each iteration is provided in Table \ref{tab:distributions}. Figure \ref{fig:nbody-setup} shows an example of 20 random realizations of the system setup for fixed $P_\text{e}$ and $e_\text{e}$. 

With the addition of planet e to our simulations, we update our stability criteria so that a system is also flagged as ``unstable'' if planet e enters the Hill sphere of planet f, or if any planet's orbit intersects the orbit of another planet. The latter criterion places an upper limit on the eccentricity of planet e for a given orbital period due to the intersection of its periastron distance with the orbit of planet d (note, however, that we do not explicitly include planet d in the N-body simulations). Assuming that planet d has a circular orbit\footnote{This is consistent with \citet{Santerne+2019}, who report a measured eccentricity for planet d of $e_\text{d} = 0.06 \pm 0.06$.}, this limit is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:crit_p}
    P_\text{e,crit}(e_\text{e}) \simeq \frac{2 \pi}{\sqrt{G M_\star}} \bigg(\frac{a_\text{d}}{1 - e_\text{e}}\bigg)^{3/2}
\end{equation}
where $a_\text{d}$ is the semi-major axis of planet d and $G$ is the Newtonian gravitational constant. Note that for the baseline eccentricity of planet e \citep[$e_\text{e} = 0.14$;][]{Santerne+2019}, $P_\text{e,crit} \approx 351 \,\text{d}$, which is $\sim$1.8$\sigma$ below the baseline period of planet e \citep[$P_\text{e} = 369 \pm 10 \,\text{d}$;][]{Santerne+2019}.

We explore the fractional stability of the system in the parameter space around this limit over a timescale of $10^5$ yrs, selecting a range of $P_\text{e}$ and $e_\text{e}$ consistent with their observed values within $\sim$2$\sigma$ \citep[see Table \ref{tab:distributions};][]{Santerne+2019}. Again, for each $(P_\text{e}, e_\text{e})$ pair, we compute $f_\text{stab}$ by running a set of 20 independent trials \citep{Rosario-Franco+2020AJ, Jagtap+2021} with the randomly selected parameters described above, and dividing the resulting number of stable trials by 20.

\subsection{Tidal Migration}

In addition to gravitational interactions with other planets, tidal interactions can lead to the secular evolution of a moon's orbit. Here we consider the possible effects of tides on the orbital stability of moons around \HIP. Here, we implement an equilibrium tide (ET) model, which assumes a simple parameterization to capture the relevant tidal processes without considering the detailed physics of the interiors of the bodies or 3D effects \citep[see][and references therein]{Barnes_2017}. In summary, the ET model assumes that the gravitational force of a satellite creates an elongated bulge in the planet in a state of equilibrium, whose long axis is misaligned with the line connecting the planet and moon centers of mass due to dissipative processes within the planet. This misalignment, or ``lag'' between the passage of the tidal bulge and the satellite, creates torques which lead to the secular evolution of the spin and orbital angular momenta of the two bodies. 

As detailed in \citet{Barnes_2017}, two distinct parameterizations of the tidal lag are well established in the literature: the so-called ``constant time lag'' (CTL) model, in which the time interval between the passage of the moon and the tidal bulge is fixed, and the ``constant phase lag'' (CPL) model in which the phase between the moon and the tidal bulge is constant, independent of frequency. In both frameworks, the energy dissipation and tidal bulge are coupled via two parameters: the tidal Love number of degree 2, $k_2$, which accounts for the internal forces of the deformed body (where $k_2=0$ describes a perfectly rigid body and $k_2=3/2$ a perfectly fluid body), and a parameter representing the offset between the tidal bulge axis and the line connecting the centers of mass. In the CTL model the latter parameter is referred to as the ``tidal time lag,'' $\tau$, which is inversely related to the tidal quality factor $Q$ in the CPT model. These parameters effectively describe the efficiency of the tidal response between the two bodies---larger values of $\tau$ (smaller $Q$) imply faster tidal evolution. While both CTL and CPL generally produce qualitatively similar results for the Solar System, one may be more suitable than the other depending on the specific scenario. In this work we choose to implement the CTL model, as it allows us to explore the impact of planetary rotation rate on the tidal evolution of the moon.

In both ET model frameworks, the tidal evolution of two bodies is described by a set of six differential equations and six free parameters: the semi-major axis $a$, the eccentricity $e$, the rotation rates of the primary and secondary bodies $\Omega_i$, and their two obliquities $\psi_i$ (where $i=1,2$ correspond to the primary and secondary bodies). For simplicity, here we ignore the obliquity of both bodies (setting $\psi_i = 0$). Then, following \citet{Barnes_2017} and references therein \citep{Mignard_1979, Hut_1981, Greenberg_2009}, the evolution for the CTL model is described by the following set of differential equations:
\begin{gather}
    \frac{de}{dt} = \frac{11 a e}{2 G M_1 M_2} \sum_{i=1}^2 Z^\text{ctl}_i \bigg[ \frac{f_4(e)}{\beta^{10}(e)}\frac{\Omega_i}{n} - \frac{18}{11} \frac{f_3(e)}{\beta^{13}(e)} \bigg] , \\
    \frac{da}{dt} = \frac{2a^2}{G M_1 M_2} \sum_{i=1}^2 Z^\text{ctl}_i \bigg[ \frac{f_2(e)}{\beta^{12}(e)}\frac{\Omega_i}{n} - \frac{f_1(e)}{\beta^{15}(e)} \bigg] , \label{eq:ctl_da_dt}
\end{gather}
and 
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d\Omega_i}{dt} = \frac{Z^\text{ctl}_i}{M_i r^2_{g,i} R^2_i n } \bigg[\frac{f_2(e)}{\beta^{12}(e)} - \frac{f_5(e)}{\beta^9(e)} \frac{\Omega_i}{n} \bigg]
\end{equation}
where $t$ is time, $M_i$ are the masses of the two bodies, $R_i$ are their radii, and $n$ is the mean motion. The quantity $r_g$ is the radius of gyration, which is related to the moment of inertia by $I = M (r_g R)^2$. The above equations are averaged over the orbital period and therefore represent the mean variation of the orbital parameters. 

The factor $Z^\text{ctl}_i$ is given by
\begin{equation}
    Z^\text{ctl}_i = 3 G^2 k_{2,i} M^2_j (M_i + M_j) \frac{R^5_i}{a^9} \tau_i,
\end{equation}
where $k_{2,i}$ are the second order tidal Love numbers, $\tau_i$ are the tidal time lags, and the subscripts $i$ and $j$ refer to the two bodies. 

Finally, the remaining quantities are given by:
\begin{align*}
    \beta(e) &= \sqrt{1 - e^2}, \\
    f_1(e) &= 1 + \frac{31}{2}e^2 + \frac{255}{8}e^4 + \frac{185}{16}e^6 + \frac{25}{64}e^8 , \\
    f_2(e) &= 1 + \frac{15}{2}e^2 + \frac{45}{8}e^4 + \frac{5}{16}e^6 , \\
    f_3(e) &= 1 + \frac{15}{4}e^2 + \frac{15}{8}e^4 + \frac{5}{64}e^6 , \\
    f_4(e) &= 1 + \frac{3}{2}e^2 + \frac{1}{8}e^4 , \\
    f_5(e) &= 1 + 3e^2 + \frac{3}{8}e^4 .
\end{align*}

Unlike hot Jupiters ($P \lesssim 10$ days), which are expected to be in tidally synchronous rotation states with their host stars, we expect the orbital separation of \HIP~to be large enough such that tidal effects from its host star are negligible. We test this assumption using a CTL equilibrium tide model as implemented in the open source software package \texttt{EqTide} \citep{Barnes_2017}. 

We assign the host star a mass, radius, and rotation period consistent with \citet{Santerne+2019}, and a solar radius of gyration, $r_{g,\star} \approx 0.26$ \citep[e.g.,][]{Claret+1989AAS}. We assume a Love number of $k_{2, \star} = 0.5$ and constant time lag of $\tau_\star = 0.01$ s, following \citet{Barnes_2017}. For \HIP, we use the planet mass and radius reported in \citet{Santerne+2019} and assume a rotation period of 10 hours\footnote{Note that faster rotation will generally lead to tidal migration on shorter timescales, which we explore later in this section.}, similar to that of the Solar System gas giants. For the radius of gyration and Love number \citep[which are generally not measurable for exoplanets except in special cases, e.g.,][]{Hellard+2019ApJ, Akinsanmi+2019A&A, Barros+2022A&A}, we assume analogous values to Jupiter's, and use recent measurements of Jupiter from the Juno spacecraft, $r_{g, \text{f}}=0.52$ \citep{Ni_2018} and $k_{2, \text{f}} = 0.565$ \citep{Idini+2021}. Note that Saturn has similar properties, but a slightly smaller Love number of $k_2 = 0.390$ \citep{Lainey+2017}, which would not significantly affect our results. For the constant time lag, we also assume an analogous value to Solar System gas giants, $\tau_\text{f} = 0.00766$ s \citep[e.g.,][]{Tokadjian+2020}. For reference, note that $\tau \approx 0.766$ s for Neptune-like planets and $\tau \approx 638$ s for rocky planets \citep{Tokadjian+2020}. 

Under these assumptions, we evolve the CTL model forward for a duration of 10 Gyr, starting the planet with its currently measured semi-major axis and orbital eccentricity. We find that the relative change in semi-major axis for planet f is $\ll 1$ ppm, and the change in rotation period is less than 0.1\%. Therefore, tidal interactions between planet f and its host star are negligible and we can safely ignore the tidal influence of the star for the purposes of this study.

Next, ignoring the influence of tides from the host star and any other planets, we investigate the tidal stability of a hypothetical moon orbiting planet f. As in Section \ref{sec:methods:nbody}, we consider the extreme case of an Earth-composition satellite with the same mass ratio to planet f as the Moon-Earth system ($M_\text{s} = 0.15$ \Mearth, $R_\text{s} = 0.53$ \Rearth). Again, this choice is motivated by the largest moon mass ratio in the Solar System and the fact that smaller moons would be much harder to measure. For the tidal properties, we arbitrarily assume that the satellite has a gyration radius similar to the measured value for the Solar System's largest moon $r_{g,\text{s}} = 0.56$ \citep[Ganymede;][]{Showman+1999}, and a tidal Love number and constant time lag consistent with measurement of rocky planets in the Solar System, $k_{2,\text{s}} = 0.3$ and $\tau_\text{s} = 638$ s \citep[e.g.,][and references therein]{Tokadjian+2020}. The mass and radius of the planet are again assumed to be the values reported in \citet{Santerne+2019}, and the gyration radius and Love number are set to the respective Jovian values \citep{Ni_2018, Idini+2021}. 

Because the constant time lag and the rotation period of the planet are almost entirely unconstrained, we explore how changing these parameters affects the final semi-major axis of the moon after a duration of $10^{10}$ yr. Again using the \texttt{EqTide} code \citep{Barnes_2017}, we evolve the system forward in time starting the satellite on a tidally-locked, circular orbit. We calculate a suite of models, varying the initial semi-major axis of the moon from 2$R_p$ ($\approx$0.0263$R_\text{H}$) to 0.4081$R_\text{H}$ (i.e., the stability limit for a circular orbit of planet f from our N-body simulations). As a fiducial case, we choose $\tau_\text{f}$ to be consistent with the estimates for the Solar System gas giants, $\tau_\text{J} = 0.00766$ s \citep{Tokadjian+2020} and a rotation period similar to that of Jupiter, $P_\text{rot,f} = 10$ hr. Then, we investigate the effect of planetary rotation rate by running the same grid of models assuming a slow planet rotation ($P_\text{rot,f} = 24$ hr) and a fast planet rotation ($P_\text{rot,f} = 3$ hr). For each case, we also test two extreme cases of the constant time lag by setting $\tau_\text{f}$ to 0.01 and 100 times the value assumed for Jupiter $\tau_\text{J}$. Finally, after running each model for $10^{10}$ yr, we compare the final semi-major axis of the moon to the stability limit from dynamical simulations to determine whether tidal migration can significantly destabilize the system.

\section{Results and Discussion} \label{sec:results_disc}

In this section we discuss the results of our numerical N-body and tidal migration simulations. We then discuss the observability of large exomoons orbiting \HIP~in transit photometry by comparing theoretical finely-sampled light curves to observations from HST and K2, and then simulating idealized observations from the PLATO mission. Finally, we explore the potential impact of large moons with atmospheres on the observed transmission spectrum of \HIP.

\subsection{Stability Limits from Dynamical Simulations}

Our initial set of simulations closely followed the work of \citet{Rosario-Franco+2020AJ}, but in greater detail for the HIP\,41378 system. While \citet{Rosario-Franco+2020AJ} studied the stability of a Neptune-size moon orbiting a Kepler-1625b analog, here we simulated \HIP~with a Mars-size 0.15 \Mearth~satellite, varying the eccentricity $e_\text{f}$ of the host planet, and the semi-major axis $a_\text{s}$ and initial mean anomaly $\mathcal{M}_\text{s}$ of the satellite. Ignoring the other planets in the system, we defined the quantity $f_\text{stab}$ as the fraction of 20 simulations with randomly chosen $\mathcal{M}_\text{s}$ (and fixed $e_\text{f}$ and $a_\text{s}$) that are stable over $10^5$ yr. Figure \ref{fig:nbody-a_moon-vs-ecc_f} shows the results of our simulations, where $f_\text{stab}$ is quantified by color and wholly unstable regions ($f_\text{stab} = 0$) are hatched out. Regions where $0 < f_\text{stab} < 1$ are quasi-stable, while regions where $f_\text{stab} = 1$ are absolutely stable over $10^5$ yr.

Our results were qualitatively similar to \citet{Rosario-Franco+2020AJ}, and quantitatively consistent in terms of the stability boundary (i.e., the largest $a_\text{s}$ with $f_\text{stab} = 1$ for a given $e_\text{f}$). For comparison, we modeled the stability boundary as 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:stability_limit}
    a_\text{crit} = c_1 (1 - c_2 e_f)
\end{equation}
where $a_\text{crit}$ is implicitly in terms of the fraction of the Hill radius, $c_1$ is the stability limit for circular orbits, and $c_2$ is a slope parameter. 

We determine the coefficients $c_1$ and $c_2$ using least squares optimization as implemented in the \texttt{scipy} \texttt{curve\_fit} function \citep{Virtanen+2020}, and find that $c_1 = 0.4081 \pm 0.0017$ and $c_2 = 1.0163 \pm 0.0146$. For comparison, the coefficients determined by \citet{Rosario-Franco+2020AJ} are $c_1 = 0.4061 \pm 0.0028$ and $c_2 = 1.1257 \pm 0.0273$. Although we determined a value of $c_1$ that is consistent with \citet{Rosario-Franco+2020AJ}, our value of $c_2$ is smaller by about $3.5\sigma$ (i.e., our model tends to predict a higher stability limit as eccentricity increases). The discrepancy at larger eccentricity is likely due by our different choice of planet semi-major axis. \citet{Rosario-Franco+2020AJ} assumed an orbital separation of 1 AU for their simulations, compared to our assumption of 1.37 AU. Because our planet and moon are farther away from the host star, the system is more stable against gravitational perturbations.

We used the results from this simple case to inform our second suite of simulations, which more realistically represented the HIP\,41378 system by including planet e. Since the observed eccentricity of planet f is near zero, we randomly selected the initial semi-major axis of its satellite from a uniform distribution between $0.1 R_\text{H}$ and $0.4 R_\text{H}$ (i.e., approximately the stability limit for low-eccentricity orbits). The mass of the satellite was assumed to be the same as in our initial simulations, but the initial mean anomaly and inclination were drawn from uniform distributions. The other initial parameters for the satellite and planets e and f were chosen randomly from the distributions given in Table \ref{tab:distributions}. As before, we determined $f_\text{stab}$ by taking the number of simulations for fixed $e_\text{e}$ and $P_\text{e}$ that survived over $10^5$ yr and dividing by 20. Our results are shown in Figure \ref{fig:nbody-per_e-vs-ecc_e}, where again $f_\text{stab}$ is indicated by color and absolutely unstable regions ($f_\text{stab} = 0$) have been hatched out. The upper limit on $e_\text{e}$ for a given $P_\text{e}$ (Equation \ref{eq:crit_p}), which is constrained by the orbit of the inner planet d, is shown in red, and the values of $e_\text{e}$ and $P_\text{e}$ from \citet{Santerne+2019} are shown to demonstrate consistency with the allowable stable configurations.

We note that quasi-stable regions to the left of the red line in Figure \ref{fig:nbody-per_e-vs-ecc_e} ($0.95 \lesssim f_\text{stab} < 1$) are dominated by two effects that are independent of planet e's orbit. In cases where the randomly chosen mass of planet f is $\gtrsim 2 \sigma$ less than the actual predicted mass, the planet's Hill radius shrinks sufficiently such that moons with larger initial orbital separations close to $\sim 0.4 R_\text{H}$ can easily be stripped away. Additionally, moons that begin closer to the planet ($\sim 0.1 R_\text{H}$) with inclinations close to zero are more likely to be captured by the planet. Therefore, assuming that the true mass of planet f is consistent with the results of \citet{Santerne+2019}, any moons within $0.4 R_\text{H}$ of the planet should remain stable as long as their orbits are not highly inclined. The likelihood of this scenario depends on the specific moon formation pathway. For formation within a circumplanetary disk, as is thought to be the case for the Galilean moon system around Jupiter, the inclination of the moon system relative to the planet spin axis should be low because of momentum conservation from the circumplanetary disk. However, other formation scenarios, such as a giant impact or dynamical capture, may result in moons with misaligned inclinations, leading to reduced stability for close-in orbits. Note, however, that tides may lead significant outward migration of such close-in moons, increasing their long-term stability. We discuss the effects of tidal migration in greater detail in the following section.





\subsection{Limits from Tidal Evolution}

Tidal forces between two rotating bodies can lead to secular changes in their spins and orbital properties. For example, a well-studied case in our Solar System is the gradual recession of Earth's Moon (and subsequent lengthening of the Earth's day) over Gyr timescales. We investigated how such tidal migration may influence the long-term orbital stability of a hypothetical moon orbiting \HIP. 

In our ET simulations outlined in Section \ref{sec:methods}, the secular evolution was parameterized by two intrinsic properties of the orbiting bodies, $k_2$ and $\tau$. Though both $k_2$ and $\tau$ are completely unknown for \HIP~(as are the moment of inertia and spin rate), there are constraints on these parameters for many Solar System bodies (though $\tau$ and $Q$ have uncertainties spanning orders of magnitude). We therefore assumed that the properties of \HIP~and any hypothetical moon are analogous to Solar System bodies. For the fiducial case, we assumed Jupiter-like values for $k_2$, $\tau$, $r_g$, and $\Omega$ for the planet, as described earlier in Section \ref{sec:methods}. We subsequently tested cases where $\tau$ was two orders of magnitude larger and smaller than the estimated Jovian value \citep[with the larger value representing a planet with Neptune-like properties; e.g.,][]{Tokadjian+2020}, and the rotation period was changed to either 3 hr (``fast'') or 24 hr (``slow''). For the satellite, we assumed tidally synchronous rotation, and $k_2$, $\tau$, and $r_g$ consistent with rocky Solar System bodies.

For simplicity, we only considered moons with circular, prograde orbits, and zero obliquity. We ran each simulation for 10 Gyr, varying the initial semi-major axis of the moon from 2$R_p$ to 31.07$R_p$ (0.0263$R_\text{H}$ to 0.4081$R_\text{H}$) such that the moon's initial orbital period was always longer than the planet's rotation period---this ensured that no inward migration would occur, in which case the moon would quickly collide with the planet (e.g., for the 24 hr rotation case, the moon would migrate inward instead of outward if its semi-major axis were $\lesssim$1.6$R_p$). For each rotation rate and constant time lag case, we show an example of the time evolution of the satellite's semi-major axis in Figure \ref{fig:tidal}, as well as how the final semi-major axis of the satellite varies as a function of its initial semi-major axis. Our results demonstrate that tidal migration does not, in most cases, significantly affect the long-term orbital stability of a large exomoon orbiting \HIP.

Because we are primarily interested in how the semi-major axis, $a$, of the moon, it is useful for our discussion to introduce a timescale associated with the evolution of $a$, which we can write as $\tau_\text{mig} \sim a / \dot{a}$ (where $\dot{a}$ is the time derivative of $a$). Under the assumptions that $\psi_i = e = 0$, $M_\text{f} \gg M_\text{s}$, and $\Omega_\text{s}/n = 1$ (i.e., the moon is tidally locked), we can use the time derivative from Equation \ref{eq:ctl_da_dt} to show that the migration timescale scales as follows:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:timescale}
    \tau_\text{mig} \propto \frac{a^8}{k_{2,\text{p}} \tau_\text{p} M_\text{s} R_\text{p}^5} \bigg( \frac{\Omega_\text{p}}{n} - 1 \bigg)^{-1}
\end{equation}
where the subscript ``p'' indicates the planet (primary) and subscript ``s'' indicates the satellite (secondary). Note that in Equation \ref{eq:ctl_da_dt}, the assumption of setting $e=0$ implies that the $\beta(e)$, $f_1(e)$, and $f_2(e)$ terms become unity.


This scaling relation is consistent with our numerical results: larger values of $\tau$ cause the semi-major axis to increase on faster timescales than smaller values of $\tau$, and shorter planet rotation periods (larger $\Omega$) also lead to faster evolution of the semi-major axis. Therefore, we note that tides could potentially destabilize a moon if the planet has a very large $\tau$ value (small $Q$) or is rotating quickly, which could increase semi-major axis sufficiently after $\sim$10 Gyr to be beyond the empirically determined stability limit (see the blue dashed line in the right panel of Figure \ref{fig:tidal}). In fact, if $\tau$ is sufficiently large, any moons which formed close to the stability limit would risk migrating outward far enough to be stripped away from the planet by dynamical interactions. This scenario would require that $\tau$ be roughly two orders of magnitude larger than the value estimated for the Solar System giants. However, we cannot rule out this possibility because $\tau$ remains virtually unconstrained, especially for planets like \HIP, whose structure remains unknown with current measurements, and for which we have no close analogs in the Solar System.

Furthermore, we can gain insights regarding different moon scenarios from the scaling relation in Equation \ref{eq:timescale}. For example, this relation shows that less massive moons (which are presumably more common than the large moon we simulated here) migrate on a longer timescale, which means they would be less likely to be stripped away by dynamical interactions. Additionally, if \HIP~has a smaller radius than assumed here, then the migration timescale could drastically increase as well ($\tau_\text{mig} \propto R_\text{p}^{-5}$). This could be the case, for example, if \HIP~is indeed a smaller size planet surrounded by optically thick circumplanetary rings (although modeling such a scenario is beyond the scope of this work). This demonstrates that the cases we have chosen to simulate here probe near the upper limit of plausible moon configurations: decreasing the mass of the moon or shrinking the size of the planet would only serve to increase the chances of the moon's survival.





\subsection{Exomoon Observability}

Despite significant challenges in robustly detecting moons orbiting exoplanets, a number of efforts in recent years have attempted to uncover the first exomoon signals. Notably, the ``Hunt for Exomoons with \textit{Kepler}'' \citep[HEK;][]{Kipping+2012} systematically analyzed the light curves of a subset of all \textit{Kepler} planet candidates most amenable to hosting a moon. Using Bayesian multimodal nested sampling with a photodynamical forward model \citep[\texttt{LUNA};][]{Kipping+2011} to generate combined planet-moon transit light curves, \citet{Kipping+2013_II} constrained the satellite-to-planet mass ratios for seven potential satellite-hosting exoplanets, but did not find compelling evidence for an exomoon around any. Subsequent HEK searches also resulted in null exomoon detections in dozens of \textit{Kepler} systems \citep{Kipping+2015}, but set upper mass limits on satellites orbiting the habitable-zone planet Kepler-22b \citep{Kipping+2013_III} in addition to eight planets in M-dwarf systems \citep{Kipping+2014}. Finally, HEK has also constrained a tentative upper limit on the occurrence rate of Galilean-size moons around planets orbiting between 0.1 and 1 AU \citep{Teachey+2018}.

Although these surveys have not yet robustly confirmed any exomoons, they have detected at least two exomoon candidates. \citet{Teachey+2018_nature} reported evidence from transit observations and timing variations of the first exomoon candidate Kepler-1625b I, consistent with a Neptune-size satellite orbiting a Jovian-like planet. More recently, \citet{Kipping+2022} found tentative evidence supporting the existence of the exomoon candidate Kepler-1708b I, consistent with a 2.6 \Rearth~satellite. However, the veracity of either detection is the subject of ongoing discussion in the literature \citep[e.g.,][]{Kreidberg+2019, Teachey+2020, Cassese+2022}. 

Based on a suite of N-body and ET simulations in this work, we have shown that it is feasible for \HIP~to host a relatively large exomoon. Naturally, this leads to the question of whether such a moon could be detected with current and future facilities. While direct photodynamical searches for exomoons may be promising for other systems \citep[e.g., Kepler-1625b and Kepler-1708b;][]{Teachey+2018_nature, Kipping+2022}, several factors severely complicate such an effort for \HIP~given the existing data and the properties of the system. 

For example, unlike the original \textit{Kepler} mission, the extended K2 mission experienced significant systematic noise correlated with the spacecraft pointing \citep{Howell+2014}. Though it is possible to correct some correlated noise algorithmically \citep[e.g.,][]{Vanderburg+2016_k2sff}, residual systematics can persist at levels comparable to an exomoon signal. Moreover, for HST observations, systematic noise and gaps in the phase/time coverage introduced by the orbit of the telescope around Earth must be treated with caution, as these effects may also complicate detecting an exomoon in the light curve \citep[e.g.,][]{Kreidberg+2019}. For multiplanet systems such as HIP\,41378, one must also be wary of additional uncertainties in the inferred masses and orbits of other planets in the system, which can in turn lead to uncertain TTVs that affect the exomoon host (e.g., planet e). Without a firm grasp of the planet-planet-induced TTVs in this system, it is prohibitively difficult to disentangle potential TTVs caused by an orbiting moon, though in principle it may be possible for other systems \citep{Kipping_2021MNRAS}.

While these factors likely preclude a meaningful direct photodynamical search for exomoons orbiting \HIP~with current observations, it is still worth considering the effects that a large exomoon may have on transit observations. That is, although it is currently very difficult to detect exomoons (and robust confirmation is even more challening), they are likely included in extant and future observations of their exoplanet hosts. As our observations become more precise with newer technology (e.g., JWST and ELTs) it is necessary to consider exomoons as a source of uncertainty in our inferences about exoplanets, especially as we begin to probe the atmospheres of smaller planets in search of signatures of life. In this section we consider an idealized analog of \HIP~to explore how large exomoons can affect transit observations.


\subsubsection{White Light Curve}

\begin{figure*}[tbh]

    \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{HST_moon_comparison.pdf}
    \caption{HST white light curve of \HIP~from \citet{Alam+2022} (points with errorbars) and best fit planet-only \texttt{Pandora} model (red dashed line). The black lines show simulated light curves with satellites injected at arbitrary orbital phase for ease of comparison---the solid line shows the signal from a 0.53 \Rearth~moon, while the dash-dotted line shows the signal from an Earth-size moon. Both simulated moons have zero inclination and an orbital period of 30 days. A zoomed-in view near the transit center is shown in the inset panel, demonstrating the small effect produced by the presence of exomoons---the maximal flux difference between the moon-free and 0.53 \Rearth~moon models ($\sim$14 ppm; i.e., the transit depth of a 0.53 \Rearth~body transiting a 1.3 \Rsun~star) is highlighted in cyan. Posterior distributions for the planet-only model parameters are shown in Figure \ref{fig:corner}.}
    \label{fig:HST_lc}
\end{figure*}


To demonstrate the high signal-to-noise ratio required to detect a transiting exomoon, we modeled the fully detrended HST white light curve of \HIP~from \citet{Alam+2022} and injected the signal from a hypothetical moon orbiting the planet. We computed model light curves and evaluated the likelihood of each model using the \texttt{Pandora} package \citep{Hippke+2022}, an open-source photodynamical exomoon transit code optimized for computational speed and accuracy. First, for the planet-only model, we fixed the barycentric orbital period, semi-major axis, and inclination to the current literature values for \HIP~\citep{Santerne+2019}, and fit for the planet-to-star size ratio $R_p / R_\star$, quadratic limb darkening coefficients $q_1$ and $q_2$ \citep{Kipping_2013MNRAS_limbdarkening}, and an offset $\Delta T_0$ in the barycentric time of transit center $T_0$ to allow for small deviations from the transit center reported in \citet{Alam+2022}. We assumed a circular orbit for the planet. To effectively compute a planet-only model using \texttt{Pandora}, we tuned the satellite mass and radius to negligible values \citep[see][]{Hippke+2022}. 

Then, to derive posterior probability distributions for the planet-only fit, we used the nested sampling Monte Carlo algorithm \texttt{MLFriends} \citep{Buchner_2016, Buchner_2019} implemented in the \texttt{UltraNest}\footnote{\url{https://johannesbuchner.github.io/UltraNest/}} package \citep{Buchner_2021}. We imposed a Gaussian prior on $R_p / R_\star$ based on the results of \citet{Alam+2022}, and a conservative uniform prior on $\Delta T_0$ of $\pm0.1$ days\footnote{\citet{Alam+2022} reported a much smaller uncertainty in $T_0$ of about 0.002 days.}. For the limb-darkening coefficients, we estimated initial values with the \texttt{ExoTiC-LD} package \citep{hannah_wakeford_2022_6809899} using the 3D stellar models from \citet{Magic+2015} and stellar parameters from \citet{Santerne+2019}, then used these values to define Gaussian priors on $q_1$ and $q_2$ with a standard deviation of $0.1$. Using a Gaussian likelihood function, we then ran the \texttt{UltraNest} \texttt{ReactiveNestedSampler} with 800 live points, and a step sampler with 2000 steps, until convergence was achieved. We chose this particular nested sampling approach because it can be easily extended to conduct efficient retrievals of the full set of planet and moon parameters, whose posterior probability distributions can be multi-modal \citep[see][]{Hippke+2022}. Figure \ref{fig:HST_lc} shows the detrended white light curve from \citet{Alam+2022} along with the best-fit transit model from our nested sampling analysis. The full posterior probability distributions from the analysis are shown in Figure \ref{fig:corner} in the appendix. 

To investigate how a transiting exomoon would change the white light curve, we then calculated \texttt{Pandora} transit models with hypothetical 0.53 \Rearth~and 1 \Rearth~satellites injected on an arbitrary 30-day orbit ($a_\text{s} \approx 11\,R_\text{p} \approx 0.14\,R_\text{H}$) around \HIP. We calculated these models with \texttt{Pandora} assuming the best-fit parameters determined from the planet-only fit, but we set the moon radius to 0.53 \Rearth~or 1 \Rearth. In both cases we arbitrarily selected the moon's orbital phase for ease of comparison, and ignored the TTV caused by the moon by leaving the satellite mass set to be negligible. For comparison, these moon-injected transit models are shown along with the best-fit planet-only model in Figure \ref{fig:HST_lc}. The light curve models in Figure \ref{fig:HST_lc} clearly demonstrate the need for much higher precision ($\lesssim$15 ppm) than is available in current HST observations in order to photometrically detect exomoons around \HIP. 

We note that in an independent analysis of the HST/WFC3 transit of \HIP, \citet{Edwards+2022arXiv} obtained an RMS in the HST transit light curve of 125 ppm, compared to the 485 ppm RMS of \citet{Alam+2022}; since this precision is still $\gg$15 ppm, our conclusions here are independent of the choice of HST reduction. This high level of precision could, however, be within reach of JWST for certain systems---for example, \citet{Coulombe+2023arXiv} showed that the JWST NIRISS/SOSS white light curve of WASP-18b bins down to $\sim$5 ppm over one hour timescales, and \citet{Lustig-Yaeger+2023arXiv} demonstrated a similar result for LHS 475b using JWST NIRSpec/BOTS.

For completeness, we repeated the above procedure using observations from Campaigns 5 and 18 of the K2 mission. We downloaded the long-cadence (and short-cadence, available for C18) \texttt{K2SFF} detrended light curves \citep{Vanderburg+2016_k2sff} using the \texttt{Lightkurve} package \citep{lightkurve_2018ascl.soft12013L}, and removed long-term variability by fitting a basis spline to the out-of-transit flux and dividing it out of the data \citep[as in][]{Berardo+2019}. Treating each campaign separately, we then repeated the procedure used to fit a planet-only model to the HST data, but we used the results from \citet{Santerne+2019} to define $T_0$ and set Gaussian priors on the $R_p / R_\star$, $q_1$, and $q_2$. The K2 data and best fit planet-only model are shown in Figure \ref{fig:K2_lc} in the appendix, along with the light curves with injected hypothetical satellites with radii of 0.53 \Rearth~and 1 \Rearth. The posterior probability distributions for the planet-only fit are shown in Figure \ref{fig:corner_k2} in the appendix. Similar to the HST observations, the K2 data are not precise enough to distinguish between planet-only and planet-moon transit models, and residual systematic variations at the $\gtrsim$20 ppm level can mimic the small signal produced by a moon.

Finally, we simulated an idealized single transit observation of \HIP~from the future PLAnetary Transits and Oscillation of stars (PLATO) mission, expected to launch in 2026 \citep{Rauer+2014}. We considered two scenarios: one in which only planet f transits a bright, photometrically quiet star with properties of HIP\,41378, and one in which the planet is orbited by an Earth-size satellite with the same configuration as previously described. We assumed a cadence of 600 s (10 min), as will be used for PLATO light curves, and a noise level of 20 ppm/hr for a $m_V\sim9$ star in PLATO's P1 sample \citep[though this number will actually depend on the number of cameras used to observe the target;][]{Rauer+2014}. Ignoring astrophysical variability, we added white noise to our simulated \texttt{Pandora} light curves that was randomly drawn from a Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of 49 ppm (i.e., 20 ppm/hr scaled to 10-min cadence assuming Poisson noise). The transit models and simulated PLATO observations are shown in the bottom panel of Figure \ref{fig:K2_lc} in the appendix. Even in these idealized PLATO simulations, the photometric noise floor makes it extremely difficult to distinguish between the moon and moon-free scenarios (even in the absence of systematic uncertainties). Therefore, any variations on the order of 10 ppm due to instrumental and astrophysical systematics must be very well understood in order to robustly attempt to constrain the presence of an exomoon from transit observations alone. 




\subsubsection{Implications for Transmission Spectroscopy}

\begin{figure*}[tbh]

    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{spectra_sim.pdf}
    \caption{\textbf{Top:} Transmission spectrum of \HIP~\citep[points with error bars;][]{Alam+2022}, compared to 1D forward models and a flat line.

    \label{fig:spectra}
\end{figure*}

As observational capabilities continue to improve in the era of JWST and beyond, it is worth considering the extent to which exomoons may affect the observed wavelength dependence of transit depth, or transmission spectrum, of temperate and potentially habitable worlds. Current HST WFC3 observations of \HIP's atmosphere are consistent with a featureless transmission spectrum \citep[$\chi_r^2 \approx 1.05$;][]{Alam+2022}\footnote{We note that \citet{Edwards+2022arXiv} report a different transmission spectrum from their independent analysis of the HST/WFC3 data. We discuss this point later on in this section}. Given the low density of the planet, its flat spectrum could be explained by a variety of possible scenarios, including an extended hazy atmosphere, a high-metallicity clear atmosphere, or an optically thick ring system \citep{Alam+2022, Akinsanmi+2020}. Since these scenarios are all consistent with the observations, for simplicity we chose here to model \HIP~as if it had a high-metallicity clear atmosphere, and then assessed how an exomoon with a substantial atmosphere would alter its transmission spectrum\footnote{Note, however, that the high-metallicity clear scenario is probably the least likely atmospheric composition for this cool giant planet \citep{Alam+2022}, and it is possible that the ground truth is some combination of the scenarios we have described (e.g., the planet could have rings and a moon, rings and hazes, rings and hazes and a moon, etc.). While in principle each of these scenarios could affect the observed transmission spectrum of the system in a unique way, it is beyond the scope of this paper to model each possible ring/haze/moon permutation.}.

We computed model transmission spectra and evaluated the likelihood of each one using the \texttt{PLATON} package \citep{zhang+2019PASP_platon, Zhang+2020ApJ_platon}. First, we calculated the model for the planet based on the results of \citet{Alam+2022}, assuming a 300x solar metallicity atmosphere and an isothermal ($T=294$ K) T-P profile. Following \citet{Alam+2022}, we fit the model to the observed spectrum by binning the model predictions to the wavelength channels of the observations and performing a least-squares fit. Keeping all other parameters fixed, we fit for a constant vertical offset in $R_\text{p}/R_\star$ to preserve the shape of the spectrum. The observed spectrum and best fit 300x solar metallicity model are shown in Figure \ref{fig:spectra}.

We then computed a model for the combined transmission spectrum of a planet and a moon, assuming bodies both have substantial atmospheres and are in an optimal transit geometry (i.e., we see the maximum contribution of a potential moon's atmosphere). Following our stability simulations, we considered the scenario of a 0.53~\Rearth~(0.15 \Mearth) moon. For the hypothetical moon, we assumed the same isothermal T-P profile ($T=294$~K), but imposed a metallicity that would result in a maximally puffy atmosphere in order to explore an upper limit on the exomoon's signal in the transmission spectrum. 

We determined the lowest feasible atmospheric metallicity by considering the timescale associated with atmospheric boil-off due to an isothermal Parker wind \citep[see, for example,][]{Owen+2016ApJ, Wang+Dai_2019ApJ}. We set the boil-off timescale, $\tau_\text{boil}$, equal to the system age \citep[$\sim$3.1 Gyr;][]{Santerne+2019}, and solved for the mean molecular weight, $\mu$, using the following set of equations:
\begin{align}
    \tau_\text{boil} &\sim \frac{M_\text{atmo}}{\dot{M}_\text{Parker}}, \\
    \dot{M}_\text{Parker} &= 4 \pi r_\text{s}^2 c_\text{s} \rho_0 \exp\bigg( \frac{3}{2} - \frac{2 r_\text{s}}{R_\text{sat}} \bigg).
\end{align}
Here, $c_\text{s} = (k T / \mu)^{1/2}$ is the isothermal sound speed, where $k$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the isothermal temperature; $r_\text{s} = G M_\text{sat} / (2 c_\text{s}^2)$ is the sonic radius; and $\rho_0$ is the atmospheric mass density at the surface.

Assuming a surface pressure of 1 bar for the {0.53~\Rearth} moon's atmosphere (comparable to the atmospheric surface pressure on Titan), we found a minimum mean molecular weight of $\mu\sim4.1$, approximately 2x that of Jupiter and 1.5x that of Neptune. This corresponds to a metallicity of approximately 120x solar. We note, however, that this estimation is optimistic, as we do not consider other mass loss process (e.g., photoevaporation) and we do not consider how such a low-mass object could acquire the atmosphere during formation. 

Under the assumption that the hypothetical moon would have had a viable formation pathway to achieve such a low-metallicity atmosphere, we computed its spectrum with \texttt{PLATON}, then combined this with the planet-only model as follows:
\begin{equation}
    (R_\text{p}/R_\star)_\text{eff} = \sqrt{\delta_\text{p} + \delta_\text{s}}
\end{equation}
where $(R_\text{p}/R_\star)_\text{eff}$ is the effective planet-to-star radius ratio due to the planet and moon, and $\delta_\text{p}$ and $\delta_\text{s}$ are the wavelength-dependent transit depths due to the planet and moon, respectively. Similar to before, we then performed a least-squares fit to the observed spectrum from \citet{Alam+2022}, preserving the shape of the total spectrum by fitting only for a constant offset in $R_\text{p}/R_\star$. Both models are shown alongside the observations in Figure \ref{fig:spectra}, along with the residual $R_\text{p}/R_\star$ between the planet-only and combined planet-moon models. 

Qualitatively, the addition of a moon with a substantial atmosphere results in a superposition of the moon and planet transmission spectra. Given our assumptions, the main differences between the planet-only spectrum and combined planet-moon spectrum are slightly enhanced H$_2$O absorption features ($<$50 ppm excess in $R_\text{p}/R_\star$) and a relative deficit in mid-IR and optical absorption ($<$100 ppm difference in $R_\text{p}/R_\star$) for the combined planet and moon models. We quantified the quality of each model fit, along with a flat line fit, using the reduced least-squares statistic. Like \citet{Alam+2022}, we cannot distinguish between the planet-only 300x solar metallicity model ($\chi_r^2 \approx 1.55$) or the flat line ($\chi_r^2 \approx 1.03$), given the data. Here we have also shown that the addition of the 0.53 \Rearth~exomoon with a $\mu\sim4.1$ atmosphere is indistinguishable compared to the planet-only model and the flat line ($\chi_r^2 \approx 1.61$). It is worth noting that the independent analysis of \citet{Edwards+2022arXiv} resulted in a different transmission spectrum from the HST/WFC3 data---their spectrum shows an upward slope from blue to red which is difficult to reproduce with equilibrium chemistry models and would lead to a qualitatively poorer fit to the forward models in Figure \ref{fig:spectra}. While we do not investigate the nature of the slope seen in \citet{Edwards+2022arXiv}, we conclude that using their spectrum would not change our inferences about the inability to detect an exomoon in the HST data.

Though the low-metallicity atmosphere we considered here is likely an extreme scenario and not necessarily likely for a moon orbiting \HIP, the excess absorption features in the model transmission spectrum may suggest that other systems containing large exomoons with thick atmospheres could experience non-negligible contamination if observed at high enough precision. This would be especially important for planets with smaller radii than we considered here. Such observations would need to be capable of resolving $\sim$10~ppm absorption features, a task that would be challenging even for JWST \citep[e.g.,][]{Lustig-Yaeger+2023arXiv, Coulombe+2023arXiv}.

For example, moons with substantial atmospheres could in principle contaminate otherwise high-fidelity spectra of terrestrial planets, introducing uncertainties in possible constraints on biosignature molecules. Moreover, the effects of a moon's atmosphere would vary in time, as the orbital phase of the moon at the time of observations would change with each transit. The temporal variability of the combined spectrum could therefore be misinterpreted as intrinsic temporal variability in the atmosphere of the planet. Finally, spectra of planets with large moons could be harder to interpret even if the moon itself lacks a substantial atmosphere. Akin to the transit light source effect \citep{Rackham+2018, Rackham+2019}, a moon could create an apparent time-varying inhomogeneity on the disk of the host star, leading to false spectral features. While the scenarios discussed thus far are only for singular large moons, we note that the presence of multiple smaller moons (like we see in the outer Solar System) could also introduce additional timescales and complexity to the problem. Therefore, it may be important to consider moons as a source of uncertainty in transmission spectroscopy as advances in technology allow for more precise measurements of exoplanet atmospheres.

\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

In this work we have investigated the orbital stability of a hypothetical large moon (0.15 \Mearth, 0.53 \Rearth) around the long-period ($P \approx 1.5$ yr) 12 \Mearth~planet \HIP. Using a suite of numerical N-body simulations, we have shown that moons up to this size can survive in the system over long timescales, even with the additional complexity of multiple planets in HIP\,41378 system and tidal interactions between the moon and the host planet over a wide range of assumed parameters. Although our analysis has demonstrated the plausibility of a moon orbiting \HIP, we have shown that the detection of even a large Earth-size moon in the system is unlikely given current observations, but may be feasible in the near future with high-precision JWST observations. Moreover, an exomoon with a sufficiently puffy atmosphere, while unlikely to exist, could imprint a $\sim$10 ppm features on the transmission spectrum of the planet (though it is unlikely that this signal could be recognized as such). Our main conclusions are summarized as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \HIP~could feasibly host exomoons at least as massive as 0.15 \Mearth~that are stable over a timescale of $10^5$ yr, confirming the stability limit determined by previous works \citep[e.g.,][]{Rosario-Franco+2020AJ}. Under ideal assumptions, a 0.15 \Mearth~moon does not escape planet f's gravitational sphere of influence or collide with the planet as long as it orbits within $\sim$40\% of the planet's Hill radius. This mass represents an extreme scenario, analogous to the highest moon-to-planet mass ratio observed in the Solar System. The outer stability limit moves closer in to the planet as the eccentricity of the planet's orbit around the star increases.
    \item Current constraints on the mass and orbit of the planet HIP\,41378\,\,e do not preclude the possibility of a moon orbiting \HIP. That is, the addition of planet e in our dynamical simulations does not significantly destabilize moons orbiting within $\sim$40\% of the Hill radius of planet f, assuming the true period and eccentricity of planet e are consistent with the observations of \citet{Santerne+2019}.
    \item Tidal interactions between planet f and a moon do not cause the moon to migrate outward sufficiently to escape the 0.4$R_H$ stability limit, assuming that planet f has tidal response properties comparable to the Solar System giant planets. Only in extreme circumstances where planet f is given a very large time lag ($\tau \gtrsim 0.7$ s) and fast rotation rate ($P\sim3$ hr) does tidal migration lead to the moon's escape from the gravitational influence of the planet. More massive moons would also migrate faster in principle, but we do not consider this case here because moons with higher mass ratios are not found in the Solar System, and none have been confirmed yet in extrasolar systems.
    \item Existing observations of the HIP\,41378 system from HST and K2 cannot reliably constrain the presence of exomoons, as the expected transit signal induced by a large moon (0.53 \Rearth) is only of the order 15ppm. Furthermore, uncertainties in the orbits and masses of the planets in the HIP\,41378 system, as well as correspondingly uncertain TTVs, likely preclude the detection of a moon with planned missions such as PLATO. However, it is possible that future observations with JWST capable of precision better than 20~ppm on 10-minute timescales will be able to detect exomoons in other systems with more robust planet measurements. 
    \item Exomoons with thick atmospheres may contaminate the transmission spectra of exoplanets at the $\sim$10 ppm level in a time-dependent manner (well below the precision of HST observations). However, this is an optimistic estimate which assumes that a moon can acquire and retain a low mean molecular weight atmosphere over its lifetime. Nonetheless, exomoons with significant atmospheres may be sources of uncertainty in other exoplanet systems as new technology enables smaller and smaller signals to be probed.
\end{enumerate}

We note that while our analysis provides conservative limits on the stability of exomoons orbiting \HIP~using well-tested methods such as N-body simulations and equilibrium tide modeling, there are a few caveats which may be important to consider in the real HIP\,41378 system. For example, multiple planets in the system do not have well-constrained orbital periods or masses due to the difficulty of measuring long-period planets ($P\gtrsim1$ yr). While we attempted to incorporate some of this uncertainty in our analysis (e.g., randomly drawing masses and orbital parameters for planet e in our N-body simulations), we could not account for all the unconstrained degrees of freedom in the actual HIP\,41378 system, which includes at least 5 planets in total. Moreover, we did not attempt to model the effects of multiple moons in the system, which also would have increased the complexity of our simulations.

Given the current data, another caveat is that we do not know with certainty what the true nature of \HIP~is. Throughout our analysis we assumed that the planet has a mass and radius consistent with observations \citep{Santerne+2019} and tidal properties similar to a Jovian planet. However, if in reality the planet is more similar to Neptune and it possess a circumplanetary ring system \citep[e.g.,][]{Akinsanmi+2020, Piro+Vissapragada_2020}, this could change the tidal response of the planet and therefore affect the orbital stability of moons. 

Moreover, self-consistent modelling of any moon-ring interactions is beyond the scope of this work, but would be an interesting subject of future simulations. \citet{Akinsanmi+2020} showed that observations of \HIP~are consistent with a planet of radius $R_\text{p} = 3.7$ \Rearth~($\rho_\text{p} = 1.4 \,\text{g cm}^{-3}$), with opaque rings extending from 1.05 to 2.6 \Rearth. If the rings disperse out to the Roche radius, it follows that the density of the ring material would be $\rho_\text{r} = 1.08 \,\text{g cm}^{-3}$. In this case, assuming that the ring particles have a typical radius of about 100 cm, the total mass of the rings would be approximately $10^{19}$ kg \citep[see Equation 4 of][]{Piro_2018_rings}, roughly the observed mass of Saturn's rings \citep{Iess+2019}. Hence in reality, gravitational interactions between the rings and a moon may affect their long-term stability \citep[e.g.,][]{Nakajima+2020}. On a similar note, we did not attempt to model the combined observable effects of moons and rings \citep[e.g.,][]{Ohno+2022}.

Finally, throughout our analysis we assumed that moons are a natural outcome of planet formation, and we only considered the stability of moons once they reached a tidally-locked state with planet f. That is, we did not attempt to treat exomoon formation and evolution in a self-consistent manner, and we remained agnostic to the specific formation pathway of our simulated moons.

To assess the observability of an exomoon, we chose to model transit observations because these are likely the most promising for a long-period transiting planet like \HIP. We note that aside from photodynamical transit searches for exomoons such as HEK \citep{Kipping+2012} and the future Transiting Exosatellites, Moons, and Planets in Orion (TEMPO) survey \citep{Limbach+2022}, several other methods of detecting exomoons have been proposed. For example, the orbital sampling effect (OSE) technique \citep{Heller+2014_ose}, which leverages many transit observations to achieve robust statistics, can be used to infer the size, orbital separation, and mass of transiting exomoons from a phase-folded light curve of about a dozen transits \citep{Hippke_2015, Heller+2016}. However, this is not currently feasible for \HIP~because the planet's long orbital period and transit duration make it difficult to acquire the necessary large number of observations.

Other novel approaches, including direct imaging and Doppler spectroscopy \citep{Peters+Turner_2013, Agol+2015, Vanderburg+2018}, radio emission from satellite-hosting exoplanets \citep{Noyola+2014, Noyola+2016, Narang+2022arXiv}, and combined planet-moon thermal phase curves \citep{Forgan_2017}, may also be fruitful probes of exomoons with future technologies. But again, \HIP~is not an optimal target for such studies. The semi-major axis of planet f is too small for current direct imaging technology, with a sky-projected angular separation of $\sim$13~mas, and uncertainties in the other planet masses and orbits preclude a radial velocity exomoon search. Moreover, uncertainty regarding the nature of planet f make radio emission studies challenging, and the cool equilibrium temperature of planet f ($T_\text{eq} = 294$~K) is not sufficient to produce an appreciable thermal phase curve.

Nonetheless, as our ability to measure exoplanets continues to improve in the future, exomoons may indeed become a more important source of uncertainty (in addition to transit light source variability, stellar spectrum noise, etc.). Further into the future, we may even be able to robustly confirm detections of exomoons and constrain the properties of their atmospheres with state-of-the-art observational facilities such as ground-based extremely large telescopes (ELTs) and next-generation space missions like the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). For example, the Ancillary Science Case A-19 for the Large UV/Optical/Infrared Surveyor (LUVOIR) suggests spectroastrometry (i.e., measuring the astrometric shift that occurs between wavelengths with flux dominated by the exoplanet and wavelengths dominated by the exomoon) as a possible exomoon detection strategy with a 12~m class space telescope \citep{LUVOIR_2019arXiv}. With contrast $>10^{-9}$ and relative astrometric precision between wavelength bands of $\sim$0.1 mas, such an observatory could in principle detect an Earth-size exomoon orbiting a 1~AU Jupiter-size planet at 10~pc \citep{LUVOIR_2019arXiv}. Not only would this be a revolutionary discovery in itself, but it would also open the possibility of using exomoons as a way of studying planet formation and evolution, and even provide a potential new avenue for searching for signs of life beyond the Solar System.

\section{Additional Figures}

Here we present additional figures to supplement the main text. Figure \ref{fig:corner} shows the posterior distributions derived from our nested sampling analysis of the HST white light curve shown in Figure \ref{fig:HST_lc}---maximum likelihood values from the posteriors were used to compute the planet-only model therein. Figure \ref{fig:K2_lc} shows additional observations of \HIP~from K2 Campaigns 5 and 18, along with simulated data of a single transit event from the upcoming PLATO mission. The posterior distributions derived from nested sampling analyses of the K2 light curves are shown in Figure \ref{fig:corner_k2}, which were used to calculate the maximum likelihood planet-only transit models.

    \caption{\textbf{Top:} K2 transit light curve for \HIP~from Campaigns 5 (blue points) with best fit planet-only model (red dashed line). As in Figure \ref{fig:HST_lc}, additional models with injected signals from a 0.53 \Rearth~moon and an Earth-size moon are shown by the black solid line and dash-dotted line. The inset panel shows a zoomed-in view near mid-transit, demonstrating that the effects of moons are below the noise level of the data. Note that the 15 ppm difference in mid-transit flux between the moon-free and 0.53 \Rearth~moon cases is slightly greater in the K2 bandpass than the HST bandpass (Figure \ref{fig:HST_lc}) due to differences in the stellar limb-darkening coefficients. \textbf{Middle:} Same as the top panel, but with data from K2 Campaign 18. Short-cadence data are shown by the transparent points, while the opaque points have been binned to match the long-cadence data. \textbf{Bottom:} Simulated 10-min cadence PLATO data for a single transit of \HIP~assuming the presence of no moon (red points) and an Earth-size moon (black points). The underlying \texttt{Pandora} models for each case are shown by the lines with corresponding colors, and a zoomed-in view near mid-transit is shown in the inset panel.}

   abstract = {Visitor counting can be attractive to various applications, like business management and marketing investigation. Recently, many studies have employed wireless signals to achieve visitor counting without people's active participation and privacy intrusion. However, existing systems mainly count the overall visitors inside a certain area, which fails to provide the fine-grained information of the coming and leaving visitor flow. Unlike previous studies, this article proposes to count the in-and-out visitors to monitor visiting frequency and population, which can be applied for many indoor places, such as shops and restaurants. Therefore, we present the first WiFi-based in-and-out visitor counting system, Door-Monitor, which obtains the direction (enter or exit) and the number of visitors passing by the door. The WiFi signals enable us to count the visitors in a low-cost and nonintrusive way, and it can tell the exact number of visitors even when multiple persons pass by the door simultaneously. To detect the visitors' passing direction, we show that the patterns in the phase difference series can indicate the entering and exiting passing directions by analyzing the effects of the passing behavior on the signal's phase information. To count the passing visitors, we perform a short time Fourier transformation on the phase difference series to generate the spectrogram, on which the convolutional neural network is applied for building a counting model. The experimental results show that the average accuracies of passing direction detection and visitor counting are 95.2\% and 94.5\%, respectively.},

@article{respiration,
   abstract = {Human respiration detection based on Wi-Fi signals does not require users to carry any device, hence it has drawn a lot of attention due to better user acceptance and great potential for real-world deployment. However, recent studies show that respiration sensing performance varies in different locations due to the nature of Wi-Fi radio wave propagation in indoor environments, i.e., respiration detection may experience poor performance at certain locations which we call "blind spots". In this paper, we aim to address the blind spot problem to ensure full coverage of respiration detection. Basically, the amplitude and phase of Wi-Fi channel state information (CSI) are orthogonal and complementary to each other, so they can be combined to eliminate the blind spots. However, accurate CSI phase cannot be obtained from commodity Wi-Fi due to the clock-unsynchronized transceivers. Thus, we apply conjugate multiplication (CM) of CSI between two antennas to remove the phase offset and construct two orthogonal signals--new "amplitude and phase" which are still complementary to each other. In this way, we can ensure full human respiration detection. Based on these ideas, We design and implement a real-time respiration detection system with commodity Wi-Fi devices. We conduct extensive experiments to validate our model and design. The results show that, with only one transceiver pair and without leveraging multiple sub-carriers, our system enables full location coverage with no blind spot, showing great potential for real deployment.},

Specific breathing and meditation exercises have been designed to improve well-being of users based on monitoring the complete breathing waveform. While wearable systems had leveraged a wealth of information available from respiration stream in a variety of applications, contact-less sensing systems are lagging behind when it comes to capturing detailed breathing metrics. In this work we propose WiRelax; the first non-contact respiratory biofeedback system that relies solely on WiFi availability. We propose algorithms that map the changes in the Channel State Information (CSI) to the instantaneous breathing state. The key contribution is a model that relates relative phase of the received signal and the micro-motion of the chest during breathing. A novel processing pipeline is developed to extract a single breathing waveform from CSI data captured across noisy multiple sub-carriers in real-time. Our evaluation in a real-world setup shows that WiRelax can estimate real-time breath-by-breath cycle time with median error less than 0.25 s ( < 13\% relative to the cycle length) thus enabling accurate device-free respiratory biofeedback.},

However, existing approaches only work when multiple persons exhibit dramatically different respiration rates and the performance degrades significantly when the targeted subjects have similar rates. What's more, they can only obtain the average respiration rate over a period of time and fail to capture the detailed rate change over time. These two constraints greatly limit the application of the proposed approaches in real life. Different from the existing approaches that apply spectral analysis to the CSI amplitude (or phase difference) to obtain respiration rate information, we leverage the multiple antennas provided by the commodity WiFi hardware and model the multi-person respiration sensing as a blind source separation (BSS) problem. Then, we solve it using independent component analysis (ICA) to obtain the reparation information of each person.

To get a better understanding of existing WiFi sensing technologies and future WiFi sensing trends, this survey gives a comprehensive review of the signal processing techniques, algorithms, applications, and performance results of WiFi sensing with CSI. Different WiFi sensing algorithms and signal processing techniques have their own advantages and limitations and are suitable for different WiFi sensing applications. The survey groups CSI-based WiFi sensing applications into three categories, detection, recognition, and estimation, depending on whether the outputs are binary/multi-class classifications or numerical values. With the development and deployment of new WiFi technologies, there will be more WiFi sensing opportunities wherein the targets may go beyond from humans to environments, animals, and objects. The survey highlights three challenges for WiFi sensing: robustness and generalization, privacy and security, and coexistence of WiFi sensing and networking. Finally, the survey presents three future WiFi sensing trends, i.e., integrating cross-layer network information, multi-device cooperation, and fusion of different sensors, for enhancing existing WiFi sensing capabilities and enabling new WiFi sensing opportunities.},

   abstract = {In the last years multiple Internet of Things (IoT) solutions have been developed to detect, track, count, and identify human activity from people that do not carry any device nor participate actively in the detection process. When WiFi radio receivers are employed as sensors for device-free human activity recognition, channel quality measurements are preprocessed in order to extract predictive features toward performing the desired activity recognition via machine learning (ML) models. Despite the variety of predictors in the literature, there is no universally outperforming set of features for all scenarios and applications. However, certain feature combinations could achieve a better average detection performance compared to the use of a thorough feature portfolio. Such predictors are often obtained by feature engineering and selection techniques applied before the learning process. This manuscript elaborates on the feature engineering and selection methodology for counting device-free people by solely resorting to the fluctuation and variation of WiFi signals exchanged by IoT devices. We comprehensively review the feature engineering and ML models employed in the literature from a critical perspective, identifying trends, research niches, and open challenges. Furthermore, we present and provide the community with a new open database with WiFi measurements in several indoor environments (i.e., rooms, corridors, and stairs) where up to five people can be detected. This dataset is used to exhaustively assess the performance of different ML models with and without feature selection, from which insightful conclusions are drawn regarding the predictive potential of different predictors across scenarios of diverse characteristics.},

Then a linear transformation is applied to extract the calibrated phase information, which we prove to have a bounded variance. For the offline stage, we design a deep network with three hidden layers to train the calibrated phase data, and employ the weights of the deep network to represent fingerprints. A greedy learning algorithm is incorporated to train the weights layer-by-layer to reduce computational complexity, where a subnetwork between two consecutive layers forms a restricted Boltzmann machine. In the online stage, we use a probabilistic method based on the radial basis function for online location estimation. The proposed PhaseFi scheme is implemented and validated with extensive experiments in two representation indoor environments.

However, most of these algorithms require a significant amount of data collection, as well as extensive computational power for additional CSI feature extraction. Moreover, the majority of these models suffer from poor accuracy when tested in a new/untrained environment. In this paper, we propose ReWiS, a novel framework for robust and environment-independent Wi-Fi sensing. The key innovation of ReWiS is to leverage few-shot learning (FSL) as the inference engine, which (i) reduces the need for extensive data collection and application-specific feature extraction; (ii) can rapidly generalize to new tasks by leveraging only a few new samples. We prototype ReWiS using off-the-shelf Wi-Fi equipment and showcase its performance by considering a compelling use case of human activity recognition. Thus, we perform an extensive data collection campaign in three different propagation environments with two human subjects. We evaluate the impact of each diversity component on the performance and compare ReWiS with a traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) approach. Experimental results show that ReWiS improves the performance by about 40\% with respect to existing single-antenna low-resolution approaches. Moreover, when compared to a CNN-based approach, ReWiS shows a 35\% more accuracy and less than 10\% drop in accuracy when tested in different environments, while the CNN drops by more than 45\%.},

Prototypical Networks learn a metric space in which classification can be performed by computing distances to prototype representations of each class.

Recently, Few-shot Learning (FSL) is proposed to tackle this problem. Using prior knowledge, FSL can rapidly generalize to new tasks containing only a few samples with supervised information. In this article, we conduct a thorough survey to fully understand FSL. Starting from a formal definition of FSL, we distinguish FSL from several relevant machine learning problems. We then point out that the core issue in FSL is that the empirical risk minimizer is unreliable. Based on how prior knowledge can be used to handle this core issue, we categorize FSL methods from three perspectives: (i) data, which uses prior knowledge to augment the supervised experience; (ii) model, which uses prior knowledge to reduce the size of the hypothesis space; and (iii) algorithm, which uses prior knowledge to alter the search for the best hypothesis in the given hypothesis space. With this taxonomy, we review and discuss the pros and cons of each category. Promising directions, in the aspects of the FSL problem setups, techniques, applications, and theories, are also proposed to provide insights for future research.1},

One of their main virtues is that, based on their data and by applying machine learning algorithms and techniques, it is possible to perform body tracking and make an accurate three-dimensional representation of body movement. Specifically, this paper will use the Kinect v2 device, which incorporates a random forest algorithm for 25 joints detection in the human body. However, although Kinect v2 is a powerful tool, there are circumstances in which the device’s design does not allow the extraction of such data or the accuracy of the data is low, as is usually the case with foot position. We propose a method of acquiring this data in circumstances where the Kinect v2 device does not recognize the body when only the lower limbs are visible, improving the ankle angle’s precision employing projection lines. Using a region-based convolutional neural network (Mask RCNN) for body recognition, raw data extraction for automatic ankle angle measurement has been achieved. All angles have been evaluated by inertial measurement units (IMUs) as gold standard. For the six tests carried out at different fixed distances between 0.5 and 4 m to the Kinect, we have obtained (mean ± SD) a Pearson’s coefficient, r = 0.89 ± 0.04, a Spearman’s coefficient, ρ = 0.83 ± 0.09, a root mean square error, RMSE = 10.7 ± 2.6 deg and a mean absolute error, MAE = 7.5 ± 1.8 deg.

In this paper, we propose the Kinect sensor-based interaction monitoring system between two persons using the Bidirectional long short-term memory neural network (BLSTM-NN). Such model can be adopted for the rehabilitation of people (who may be suffering from ASD and other psychological disorders) by analyzing their activities.

In our study, ten volunteers were involved to create five interactive groups to perform continuous activities, where the Kinect sensor was used to record data. A set of continuous activities was created using random combinations of 24 isolated activities. 3D skeleton of each user was detected and tracked using the Kinect and modeled using BLSTM-NN. We have used a lexicon by analyzing the constraints while performing continuous activities to improve the performance of the system. We have achieved the maximum accuracy of 70.72\%.

Feature extraction for impulsive noise detection has been performed by processing the amplitude of the channel state information of each subcarrier.

Fall detection systems that alert caregivers, family members or neighbours can potentially save lives.

In this paper, we consider an emerging non-wearable fall detection approach based on WiFi Channel State Information (CSI). Previous CSI based fall detection solutions have considered only time domain approaches. Here, we take an altogether different direction, time-frequency analysis as used in radar fall detection. We use the conventional Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) to extract time-frequency features and a sequential forward selection algorithm to single out features that are resilient to environment changes while maintaining a higher fall detection rate. When our system is pre-trained, it has a 93\% accuracy and compared to RTFall and CARM, this is a 12\% and 15\% improvement respectively. When the environment changes, our system still has an average accuracy close to 80\% which is more than a 20\% to 30\% and 5\% to 15\% improvement respectively.},

Existing approaches include linear, parameter-less techniques to reduce signal space dimensions and filter noise by assuming linear correlations among sub-carriers. In this work, we first model the human presence and then analyse occurrences of non-linear correlations among subcarriers. We then exploit these correlations by introducing non-linear techniques to reduce CSI dimensions and filter noise. These techniques offer adjustable parameters that enhance signal quality depending on the environment and the amount of human interaction. We analyse the performance of human presence detection using the introduced techniques with just two transceivers. Our results show that when human motion is insignificant or occurs far from the link, non-linear techniques improve the detection accuracy up to 5\% compared to the linear approach.},

This work makes two key technical contributions. First, we find that the CSI phase difference over two antennas is a more sensitive base signal than amplitude for activity recognition, which can enable very reliable segmentation of fall and fall-like activities. Second, we discover the sharp power profile decline pattern of the fall in the time-frequency domain and further exploit the insight for new feature extraction and accurate fall segmentation/detection. Experimental results in four indoor scenarios demonstrate that RT-fall consistently outperforms the state-of-The-Art approach WiFall with 14 percent higher sensitivity and 10 percent higher specificity on average.},

In this paper, we present WiSpeed, a universal low-complexity indoor speed estimation system leveraging radio signals, such as commercial WiFi, LTE, 5G, etc., which can work in both device-free and device-based situations. By exploiting the statistical theory of electromagnetic waves, we establish a link between the autocorrelation function of the physical layer channel state information and the speed of a moving object, which lays the foundation of WiSpeed. WiSpeed differs from the other schemes requiring strong LOS conditions between the source and observer in that it embraces the rich-scattering environment typical for indoors to facilitate highly accurate speed estimation. Moreover, as a calibration-free system, WiSpeed saves the users' efforts from large-scale training and fine-tuning of system parameters. In addition, WiSpeed could extract the stride length as well as detect abnormal activities such as falling down, a major threat to seniors that leads to a large number of fatalities every year. Extensive experiments show that WiSpeed achieves a mean absolute percentage error of 4.85\% for device-free human walking speed estimation and 4.62\% for device-based speed estimation, and a detection rate of 95\% without false alarms for fall detection.},

Such overhead, however, impedes readily and fast deployment of wireless device-free human detection systems in practical indoor environments. In this work, we explore PHY layer multipath profiling information to extract a novel quantitative metric Ks as an indicator for link sensitivity, and further exploit a linear detection threshold prediction model.

It deduces the state of a person by analyzing his/her influence on surrounding wireless signals. Therefore, how to characterize the influence of human behaviors is the key question. In this paper, we explore and exploit a radio image processing approach to better characterize the influence of human behaviors on Wi-Fi signals. Traditional methods deal with channel state information (CSI) measurements on each channel independently. However, CSI measurements on different channels are correlated, and thus lots of useful information involved with channel correlation may be lost. This motivates us to look on CSI measurements from multiple channels as a radio image and deal with it from the two-dimensional perspective. Specifically, we transform CSI measurements from multiple channels into a radio image, extract color and texture features from the radio image, adopt a deep learning network to learn optimized deep features from image features, and estimate the location and activity of a person using a machine learning approach. Benefits from the informative and discriminative deep image features and experimental results in two clutter laboratories confirm the excellent performance of the proposed system.},

Compared with conventional device-based human-computer interactive (HCI) methods, device-free technology with WiFi provides a new HCI method and is promising for providing better user-perceived quality-of-experience. Being essential for device-free applications, device-free human detection has gained increasing interest, of which through-the-wall (TTW) human detection is of great challenge. Existing TTW detection systems either rely on massive deployment of transceivers or require specialized WiFi monitors, making them inapplicable for real-world applications. Recently, more and more researchers have tapped into the physical layer for more robust and reliable human detection, ever since channel state information (CSI) can be exported with commodity devices. Despite great progress achieved, there have been few works studying TTW detection. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for robust device-free TTW detection (R-TTWD) of a moving human with commodity devices. Different from the time dimension-based features exploited in the previous works, R-TTWD takes advantage of the correlated changes over different subcarriers and extracts the first-order difference of eigenvector of CSI across different subcarriers for TTW human detection. Instead of direct feature extraction, we first perform a PCA-based filtering on the preprocessed data, since a simple low-pass filtering is insufficient for noise removal. Furthermore, the detection results across different transmit-receive antenna pairs are fused with a majority-vote-based scheme for more robust and accurate detection. We prototype R-TTWD on commodity WiFi devices and evaluate its performance both in different environments and over long test period, validating the robustness of R-TTWD with both detection rates for moving human and human absence over 99\% regardless of different wall materials, dynamic moving speeds, and so on.},

   abstract = {Inspired by the emerging WiFi-based applications, in this paper, we leverage ubiquitous WiFi signals and propose a device-free step counting system, called WiStep. Based on the multipath propagation model, when a person is walking, her torso and limbs move at different speeds, which modulates wireless signals to the propagation paths with different lengths and thus introduces different frequency components into the received Channel State Information (CSI). To count walking steps, we first utilize time-frequency analysis techniques to segment and recognize the walking movement, and then dynamically select the sensitive subcarriers with largest amplitude variances from multiple CSI streams. Wavelet decomposition is applied to extract the detail coefficients corresponding to the frequencies induced by feet or legs, and compress the data so as to improve computing speed. Short-time energy of the coefficients is then calculated as the metric for step counting. Finally, we combine the results derived from the selected subcarriers to produce a reliable step count estimation. In contrast to counting steps based on the torso frequency analysis, WiStep can count the steps of in-place walking even when the person's torso speed is null. We implement WiStep on commodity WiFi devices in two different indoor scenarios, and various influence factors are taken into consideration when evaluating the performance of WiStep. The experimental results demonstrate that WiStep can realize overall step counting accuracies of 90.2\% and 87.59\% respectively in these two scenarios, and it is resilient to the change of scenarios.},

Despite its promising application prospects, one challenging problem to be solved is that the performance of the DFS system degrades significantly in complex scenarios, such as through-wall and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. To alleviate this problem, this paper seeks to explore and exploit more informative features from not only the time domain and frequency domain, but also the spatial structural domain. We partition the time domain and frequency domain measurement matrices into basic structure blocks, adopt self-organizing map networks to cluster the blocks into a number of categories, so as to make it feasible to characterize the block distributions. We further adopt coherence histograms to characterize the distribution of the blocks by considering the spatial relationship between adjacent blocks. Thanks to the additional information provided by the spatial structural domain, extensive experimental results achieved in through-wall and NLOS scenarios confirm the outstanding performance of the proposed multi-domain features based DFS system.},

   abstract = {Device-free passive detection is an emerging technology to detect whether there exist any moving entities in the areas of interest without attaching any device to them. It is an essential primitive for a broad range of applications including intrusion detection for safety precautions, patient monitoring in hospitals, child and elder care at home, and so forth. Despite the prevalent signal feature Received Signal Strength (RSS), most robust and reliable solutions resort to a finer-grained channel descriptor at the physical layer, e.g., the Channel State Information (CSI) in the 802.11n standard. Among a large body of emerging techniques, however, few of them have explored the full potential of CSI for human detection. Moreover, space diversity supported by nowadays popular multiantenna systems are not investigated to a comparable extent as frequency diversity. In this article, we propose a novel scheme for device-free PAssive Detection of moving humans with dynamic Speed (PADS). Both full information (amplitude and phase) of CSI and space diversity across multiantennas in MIMO systems are exploited to extract and shape sensitive metrics for accuracy and robust target detection. We prototype PADS on commercial WiFi devices, and experiment results in different scenarios demonstrate that PADS achieves great performance improvement in spite of dynamic human movements.},

   abstract = {In recent years, a large number of researchers are endeavoring to develop wireless sensing and related applications as Wi-Fi devices become ubiquitous. As a significant research branch, gesture recognition has become one of the research hotspots. In this paper, we propose WiCatch, a novel device free gesture recognition system which utilizes the channel state information to recognize the motion of hands. First of all, with the aim of catching the weak signals reflected from hands, a novel data fusion-based interference elimination algorithm is proposed to diminish the interference caused by signals reflected from stationary objects and the direct signal from transmitter to receiver. Second, the system catches the signals reflected from moving hands and rebuilds the motion locus of the gesture by constructing the virtual antenna array based on signal samples in time domain. Finally, we adopt support vector machines to complete the classification. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that the WiCatch can achieves a recognition accuracy over 0.96. Furthermore, the WiCatch can be applied to two-hand gesture recognition and reach a recognition accuracy of 0.95.},

abstract = {This paper explores the viability of precise indoor localization using physical layer information in WiFi systems. We find evidence that channel responses from multiple OFDM subcarriers can be a promising location signature. While these signatures certainly vary over time and environmental mobility, we notice that their core structure preserves certain properties that are amenable to localization. We attempt to harness these opportunities through a functional system called PinLoc, implemented on off-the-shelf Intel 5300 cards. We evaluate the system in a busy engineering building, a crowded student center, a cafeteria, and at the Duke University museum, and demonstrate localization accuracies in the granularity of 1m x 1m boxes, called "spots". Results from 100 spots show that PinLoc is able to localize users to the correct spot with 89\% mean accuracy, while incurring less than 6\% false positives. We believe this is an important step forward, compared to the best indoor localization schemes of today, such as Horus.},

abstract = {This paper presents the design and implementation of SpotFi, an accurate indoor localization system that can be deployed on commodity WiFi infrastructure. SpotFi only uses information that is already exposed by WiFi chips and does not require any hardware or firmware changes, yet achieves the same accuracy as state-of-the-art localization systems. SpotFi makes two key technical contributions. First, SpotFi incorporates super-resolution algorithms that can accurately compute the angle of arrival (AoA) of multipath components even when the access point (AP) has only three antennas. Second, it incorporates novel filtering and estimation techniques to identify AoA of direct path between the localization target and AP by assigning values for each path depending on how likely the particular path is the direct path. Our experiments in a multipath rich indoor environment show that SpotFi achieves a median accuracy of 40 cm and is robust to indoor hindrances such as obstacles and multipath.},

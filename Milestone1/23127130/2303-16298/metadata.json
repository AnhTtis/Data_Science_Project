    "abstract": "In this article, the structure of the incremental quasistatic contact problem with Coulomb friction in linear elasticity (Signorini-Coulomb problem) is unraveled and optimal existence results are proved for the most general bidimensional problem with arbitrary geometry and elasticity modulus tensor. The problem is reduced to a variational inequality involving a nonlinear operator which handles both elasticity and friction. This operator is proved to fall into the class of the so-called Leray-Lions operators, so that a result of Brézis can be invoked to solve the variational inequality. It turns out that one property in the definition of Leray-Lions operators is difficult to check and requires proving a new fine property of the linear elastic Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator. This fine property is only established in the case of the bidimensional problem, limiting currently our existence result to that case. In the case of isotropic elasticity, either homogeneous or heterogeneous, the existence of solutions to the Signorini-Coulomb problem is proved for arbitrarily large friction coefficient. In the case of anisotropic elasticity, an example of nonexistence of a solution for large friction coefficient is exhibited and the existence of solutions is proved under an optimal condition for the friction coefficient.",

    "abstract": "We study the components of the family of determinantal degree $d$ surfaces in $\\mathbb{P}^3$. We compute their dimensions and show that each of them contains a component of the Noether-Lefschetz locus $NL(d)$. Our computations exhibit that determinantal surfaces in $\\mathbb{P}^3$ of degree 4 form a divisor in $|\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{P}^3}(4)|$ with 5 irreducible components. The degrees of these components, we will compute, are $320,2508,136512,38475,320112$.",

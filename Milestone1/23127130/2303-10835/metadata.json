    "abstract": "This study rigorously investigates the Keynesian cross model of a national economy with a focus on the dynamic relationship between government spending and economic equilibrium. The model consists of two ordinary differential equations regarding the rate of change of national income and the rate of consumer spending. Three dynamic relationships between national income and government spending are studied. This study aims to classify the stabilities of equilibrium states for the economy by discussing different cases of government spending. Furthermore, the implication of government spending on the national economy is investigated based on phase portraits and bifurcation analysis of the dynamical system in each scenario.",

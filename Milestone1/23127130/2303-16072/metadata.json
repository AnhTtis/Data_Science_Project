    "abstract": "The sine-Gordon model in 3+1 dimensions is known to admit two oscillons of different energy and frequency but comparable lifetime. We show that the oscillon spectrum includes more spherically symmetric ``states''. We identify new high-amplitude oscillons by allowing the field profile to have a number of nodes. For each number of nodes, we find 2 states with a comparable lifetime to the nodeless ones. Oscillons with nodes are, however, unstable to non-spherical perturbations and so their lifetime is significantly reduced. Interestingly, these states are seen to fragment into a collection of nodeless oscillons. The heavy nodeless oscillon is quite remarkable: despite its energy it is stable against fragmentation. Moreover, it has considerably small oscillation frequency, meaning that it can be interpreted as a rather relativistic bound state.",

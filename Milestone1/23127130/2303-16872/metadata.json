    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the multi-dimensional backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) whose generator depends also on the mean of both variables. When the generator is diagonally quadratic, we prove that the BSDE admits a unique local solution with a fixed point argument. When the generator has a logarithmic growth of the off-diagonal elements (i.e., for each $i$, the $i$-th component of the generator has a logarithmic growth of the $j$-th row $z^j$ of the variable $z$ for each $j \\neq i$), we give a new apriori estimate and obtain the existence and uniqueness of the global solution.",

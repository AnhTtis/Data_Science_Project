    "abstract": "Context. It is common for massive stars to engage in binary interaction. In close binaries, the components can enter a contact phase, where both stars overflow their respective Roche lobes simultaneously. While there exist observational constraints on the stellar properties of such systems, the most detailed stellar evolution models that feature a contact phase are not fully reconcilable with those measurements. Aims. We aim to consistently model contact phases of binary stars in a 1D stellar evolution code. To this end, we develop the methodology to account for energy transfer in the common contact layers. Methods. We implement an approximative model for energy transfer between the components of a contact binary based on the von Zeipel theorem in the stellar evolution code MESA. We compare structure and evolution models with and without this transfer and analyze the implications for the observable properties of the contact phase. Results. Implementing energy transfer helps eliminating baroclinicity in the common envelope between the components of a contact binary, which, if present, would drive strong thermal flows. We find that accounting for energy transfer in massive contact binaries significantly alters the mass ratio evolution and can extend the lifetime of an unequal mass ratio contact system.",

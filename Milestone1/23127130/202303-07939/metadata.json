    "abstract": "We investigate the $2\\,^3\\!S_1$--$2\\,^3\\!P_J$ ($J = 0, 1, 2$) transitions in\n$\\rm^6Li^+$ using the optical Ramsey technique and achieve the most precise\nvalues of the hyperfine splittings of the $2\\,^3\\!S_1$ and $2\\,^3\\!P_J$ states,\nwith smallest uncertainty of about 10~kHz. The present results reduce the\nuncertainties of previous experiments by a factor of 5 for the $2\\,^3\\!S_1$\nstate and a factor of 50 for the $2\\,^3\\!P_J$ states, and are in better\nagreement with theoretical values. Combining our measured hyperfine intervals\nof the $2\\,^3\\!S_1$ state with the latest quantum electrodynamic (QED)\ncalculations, the improved Zemach radius of the $\\rm^6Li$ nucleus is determined\nto be 2.44(2)~fm, with the uncertainty entirely due to the uncalculated QED\neffects of order $m\\alpha^7$. The result is in sharp disagreement with the\nvalue 3.71(16) fm determined from simple models of the nuclear charge and\nmagnetization distribution. We call for a more definitive nuclear physics value\nof the $\\rm^6Li$ Zemach radius.",

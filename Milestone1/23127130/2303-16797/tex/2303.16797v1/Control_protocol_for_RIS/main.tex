\begin{abstract}
    The research on Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) has dominantly been focused on physical-layer aspects and analyses of the achievable adaptation of the propagation environment. Compared to that, the questions related to link/MAC protocol and system-level integration of RISs have received much less attention. This paper addresses the problem of designing and analyzing control/signaling procedures, which are necessary for the integration of RISs as a new type of network element within the overall wireless infrastructure. We build a general model for designing control channels along two dimensions: \emph{i}) allocated bandwidth (in-band and out-of band) and \emph{ii}) rate selection (multiplexing or diversity). Specifically, the second dimension results in two transmission schemes, one based on channel estimation and the subsequent adapted RIS configuration, while the other is based on sweeping through predefined RIS phase profiles. The paper analyzes the performance of the control channel in multiple communication setups, obtained as combinations of the aforementioned dimensions. While necessarily simplified, our analysis reveals the basic trade-offs in designing control channels and the associated communication algorithms. Perhaps the main value of this work is to serve as a framework for subsequent design and analysis of various system-level aspects related to the RIS technology.
    % This letter provides a comparison between the communication based on beam sweeping and the channel estimation techniques taking into account the impact of the RIS control channel.   
    % \textbf{Research question}: how reliable should the control channel be? Normally, it is assumed in the literature that the control channel always works, but what happens if it is lost (fail)?
    % \KS{While Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) have the potential to dynamically create favorable radio propagation environments, thus boosting the performance of wireless systems with minimal deployment and energy costs, their deployment entails increased overheads in terms of protocol implementation, channel setup, and control messages.
    % Nevertheless, such aspects have largely been neglected by the research community, and the primary focus has been on the the development of algorithmic methods for optimizing the RIS configurations. 
    % To truly assess the benefits of RIS-empowered configurations, a comprehensive view of the system is required notwithstanding.
    % Toward that end, this paper is centered around the practical design of control channels for RIS-aided communications and provides a systematic performance analysis.
    % Particularly, a simplified, yet generic, protocol framework is developed that is in large algorithmic-agnostic. The structure of control messages between the RIS and the system controller is investigated with regard to the in-band / out-of-band cases and events of erroneous transmissions, while a general throughput metric is derived that captures the true performance of the system.
    % Two main algorithmic paradigms of channel estimation \& iterative optimization and codebook-based beam sweeping are further analyzed in terms of their protocol requirements and achievable performance.
    % The results of the numerical analysis demonstrate that ...}

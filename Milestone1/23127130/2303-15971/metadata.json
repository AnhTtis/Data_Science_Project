    "abstract": "We construct two series of commuting Hamiltonians parametrized by a constant matrix. The first series was my guess and the second one was know, and in our approach follows from the first series. For the proof we use familier facts known from our previous consideration of the links between random matrices and Hurwitz numbers, however the text is self-consistent.",

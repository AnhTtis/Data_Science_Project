    "abstract": "The anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) is a member of the extensive family of topological effects in solid state physics. It converts a heat current into electric voltage and originates from the Berry curvature of electronic bands near the Fermi level. Recent results established the Fe$_3$Ga alloy as one of the most promising candidates for applications, due to its flat band structure consisting of rich web of nodal lines. In this theoretical work, we study the effect of deformation of Fe$_3$Ga on the anomalous Nernst effect, which naturally occurs in thin films. Furthermore, we demonstrate that doping, which effectively shifts the position of the Fermi level, can also significantly modify the strength of the effect. Lastly, we provide detailed analysis of the origin of ANE in the electronic structure of Fe$_3$Ga which yields a deeper insight into the generating mechanisms, understanding of which can lead to substantial enhancement of the effect in the future.",

    "abstract": "We carefully investigated the storage of lithium in titania films on various substrates as a function of size. The experiments enable us to separate contributions from bulk and boundary storage. The bulk storage is thermodynamically modelled in terms of charge carrier chemistry obeying local electroneutrality and of boundary storage according to the space charge conception. The battery capacity measurements are complemented by bias dependent measurements of impedance, series and parallel resistance as well as capacitance. Independent information on electron and Li distribution is gained by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), aberration-corrected annular-bright-field (ABF) STEM. As a result, we obtain the full picture in terms of equilibrium storage (lithium content) and charge carrier concentrations as a function of spatial coordinates with cell voltage as a parameter. This corresponds to no less than a unification of intercalation storage and super-capacitive storage, which are usually considered as separate phenomena, the reason for this lying in the hitherto lack of an adequate defect-chemical and nanoionic picture.",

\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we develop a new approach for document layout generation and a novel metric for document layouts evaluation. Our diffusion-based document layout generation approach shows outperforming and competitive results on several well known datasets in document layout generation. We have also shown how our approach can be applied to downstream applications, such as pretraining a document layout detector. In this paper, we provide extensive qualitative analysis and examples, so our readers understand both limitations and advantages of our method and our proposed metric. 

In the future work, we plan to explore domain generalization and conditional generation. For domain generalization, higher specificity layouts as well as full OCR generation at the line level would provide a more complete document generation system. Meanwhile, conditioning generation on the right set of factors allows the proposed method to be used more effectively in document generation pipelines.

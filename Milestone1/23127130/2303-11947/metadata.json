    "abstract": "In the framework of the theory of Dunkl-deformed bosons, Bose-Einstein condensation of two and three-dimensional Dunkl-boson gases confined in the one-dimensional gravitational field is investigated. Using the semi-classical approximation method, we calculate the expressions of the Dunkl-critical temperature $T_{c}^{D}$, the ground state population $\\frac{N_{0}^{D}}{N}$ and the Dunkl-mean energy and Dunkl-specific heat functions. Further numerical calculation shows that the condensation temperature ratio $\\frac{T_{c}^{D}}{T_{c}^{B}}$ increases with the increasing Wigner parameter.",

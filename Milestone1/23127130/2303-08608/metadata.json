    "abstract": "In a normed space setting, this paper studies the conditions under which the projected solutions to a quasi equilibrium problem with non-self constraint map exist. Our approach is based on an iterative scheme which gives rise to a sequence weakly converging to a projected solution. Finally, as a particular case, we discuss the existence of projected solutions to a quasi variational inequality problem.",

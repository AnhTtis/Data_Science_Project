    \caption{Channel augmentation on occlusion edge prediction (OE) task. We compute 5-quantiles of the pixel-wise label distribution, and use each $p$-th 5-quantile as each channel after re-normalizing into $[0, 1]$.
    Second to Fifth columns show the augmented channel with different quantile, where the last column shows the 5-channel label visualized as RGB.}

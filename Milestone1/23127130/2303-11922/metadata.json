    "abstract": "The set of degrees of maps $D(M,N)$, where $M,N$ are closed oriented $n$-manifolds, always contains $0$ and the set of degrees of self-maps $D(M)$ always contains $0$ and $1$. Also, if $a,b\\in D(M)$, then $ab\\in D(M)$; a set $A\\subseteq\\mathbb Z$ so that $ab\\in A$ for each $a,b\\in A$ is called multiplicative. On the one hand, not every infinite set of integers (containing $0$) is a mapping degree set [NWW] and, on the other hand, every finite set of integers (containing $0$) is the mapping degree set of some $3$-manifolds [CMV]. We show the following:\n  (i) Not every multiplicative set $A$ containing $0,1$ is a self-mapping degree set.\n  (ii) For each $n\\in\\mathbb N$ and $k\\geq3$, every $D(M,N)$ for $n$-manifolds $M$ and $N$ is $D(P,Q)$ for some $(n+k)$-manifolds $P$ and $Q$.\n  As a consequence of (ii) and [CMV], every finite set of integers (containing $0$) is the mapping degree set of some $n$-manifolds for all $n\\neq 1,2,4,5$.",

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

One of the key features of the SG is the replacement of conventional mechanical meters with smart meters to enable efficient, flexible and reliable two-way flow of energy and information for better coordination between suppliers and customers and control of the power grids. Renewable energy sources (RES), e.g. wind turbines and solar photovoltaics, have become one of the critical parts in SG, as well as more and more users are willing to deploy the RES and energy storage devices at their homes \cite{farmad2012integration}. This paper explores an approach to utilize the maximum available of RES taking into consideration the recognized problem of carbon pollution. By 2020, it is expected that almost 72\% of European consumers will have a smart electric meter.

Demand response management (DRM) smooths out the system power demand profile across time and provides short-term reliability benefits as it can offer load relief to resolve system and/or local capacity constraints. Thus, from the operator aspect, DRM reduces the cost of operating the grid, while from the user aspect it lowers their bills. In most of the past papers that have modeled renewable energy (RE), e.g \cite{bu2011stochastic}, \cite{he2011multiple}, the key focus has been on exploring DRM in the context of multiple energy sources, incorporating RESs on the supply side and minimizing the cost of this side. Instead, \cite{maharjanuser} includes multiple renewable and non-renewable energy sources based utility companies and focuses on minimizing the cost for each user.
Recently, game theory has been applied to the Demand Response programs \cite{saad2012game}. For example, the non-cooperative game was utilized to minimize the electricity cost of consumers \cite{mohsenian2010autonomous}, where based on a common scenario, with a single utility company serving multiple customers, the global optimal performance in terms of minimizing the energy costs is achieved at the Nash equilibrium of the formulated energy consumption scheduling game

Most of the demand-side management (DSM) approaches that have been deployed over the past three decades (e.g. \cite{ruiz2009direct}), focus on the interactions between a utility company (UC) and its customers or users. In contrast, Mohsedian-Rad et al. \cite{mohsenian2010autonomous} argue that rather than focusing on how each user behaves individually, a good DSM program should have the objective that the aggregate load satisfies some desired properties. More specifically, this work presents an incentive-based energy consumption scheduling scheme, where through an appropriate pricing scheme, the Nash equilibrium of the energy consumption game among the participating users who share the same energy source is the optimal solution that minimizes the energy cost in the system.

However, in the future SGs, energy storage is expected to be a key component in smart homes and thus, it has a strong impact on DSM. In \cite{vytelingum2010agent}, Vytelingum et al. provide a general framework within which to analyze the Nash equilibrium of an electricity grid and devise new agent-based storage learning strategies that adapt to market conditions. The simulation results show that the learning scheme converges to a Nash equilibrium while reducing the peak demand which also leads to reduce costs and carbon emissions. Based on the normal electricity usage profile of all the users in the considered SG, it is then possible to compute the Nash equilibrium points, which describe when it is best for the agents to charge their batteries, use their stored electricity, or use electricity from the SG \cite{fadlullah2011survey}.

Storage devices may be used to compensate for the variability of typical renewable electricity generation including wind, wave and solar energy. With this motivation, \cite{maharjanuser} includes multiple renewable energy sources on the supply side, in addition to the traditional fossil-fuel based sources. In \cite{mohsenian2010autonomous}, \cite{ibars2010distributed}, \cite{jia2012optimal} users are price anticipating (i.e., they take into account how their consumptions will affect the prices). For example, in \cite{ibars2010distributed} is defined a non-cooperative congestion game among users, which is used to set the price levels for the demand vector of each user. On the contrary, in case where users are price taking (\cite{li2011optimal},\cite{yang2013game}), they aim to minimize their costs.

There has been a growing interest in last years in modeling ICT systems and applications where a number of selfish agents compete over a limited capacity and low-cost resource. Very recent work, \cite{hasan2012non} and \cite{shi2011competition} has been focused on addressing the competition in game-theoretic terms. With the same spirit, in \cite{holzman2003network}, the drivers choose between a number of routes from a common-to-all origin to a common-to-all destination. In a nutshell, all the works noted above, apply selection games where players choose between specific available resources. In contrast, in this paper we consider the choice between specific sources at any time period. In our uncoordinated source selection problem, consumers are viewed as strategic decision-makers that aim at maximizing their own individual welfare.

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of intelligently navigating through complex traffic.\nUrban situations are defined by the underlying map structure and special\nregulatory objects of e.g. a stop line or crosswalk. Thereon dynamic vehicles\n(cars, bicycles, etc.) move forward, while trying to keep accident risks low.\n  Especially at intersections, the combination and interaction of traffic\nelements is diverse and human drivers need to focus on specific elements which\nare critical for their behavior. To support the analysis, we present in this\npaper the so-called Risk Navigation System (RNS). RNS leverages a graph-based\nlocal dynamic map with Time-To-X indicators for extracting upcoming sharp\ncurves, intersection zones and possible vehicle-to-object collision points.\n  In real car recordings, recommended velocity profiles to avoid risks are\nvisualized within a 2D environment. By focusing on communicating not only the\npositional but also the temporal relation, RNS potentially helps to enhance\nawareness and prediction capabilities of the user.",

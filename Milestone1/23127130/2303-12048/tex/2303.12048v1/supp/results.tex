\section{Additional Visualizations and Results}
\label{sec:res}
\paragraph{Visualizing 2D cross-attention maps and images rendered from our 3D cross-attention grids}.
While the attention maps used as ground-truth are inherently unfocused (as they are up-sampled from very low resolutions) and are not guaranteed to be view consistent, we show that learning the projection of these attention maps on to our object's density produces view-consistent heat maps for object and edit regions (Figure \ref{fig:supp_attn_kangaroo}).



\paragraph{Additional 2D image editing results}. In Figure \ref{fig:comparison2d_supp} we show additional comparisons to 2D image editing techniques. These results further illustrate that 2D methods struggle to produce view consistent results.

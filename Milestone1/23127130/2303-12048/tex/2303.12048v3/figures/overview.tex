    \caption{\textbf{An overview of our approach}. Given a set of posed images depicting an object, we optimize an initial feature grid (left). We then perform text-guided object editing using a generative SDS loss and a volumetric regularization, optimizing an edited grid $G_e$. To localize the edits, we optimize 3D cross-attention grids which define probability distributions over the object and the edit regions. We obtain a volumetric mask from these grids using an energy minimization problem over all the voxels. Finally, we merge the initial and edited grid to obtain a refined volumetric grid (right). }

    "abstract": "More than $30$ years ago, Delandtsheer and Doyen showed that the automorphism group of a block-transitive $2$-design, with blocks of size $k$, could leave invariant a nontrivial point-partition, but only if the number of points was bounded in terms of $k$. Since then examples have been found where there are two nontrivial point partitions, either forming a chain of partitions, or forming a grid structure on the point set. We show, by construction of infinite families of designs, that there is no limit on the length of a chain of invariant point partitions for a block-transitive $2$-design. We introduce the notion of an `array' of a set of points which describes how the set interacts with parts of the various partitions, and we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions in terms of the `array' of a point set, relative to a partition chain, for it to be a block of such a design.",

    "abstract": "Technology adoption research aims to determine the reasons why and how individuals, corporations, and industries start using new technology. Furthermore, technology adoption itself is decomposed into underlying sub-processes which are characterized by a finite number of sequential states in order to capture its evolutionary nature. Building upon that, in this paper a technology adoption index is being constructed that allows for statistical testing. This new framework is flexible with respect to the number of underlying models, and accounts for nonlinearities within the evolution of technology adoption. It can be considered as novel because it gives opportunity to a quantitative analysis of technology adoption that has not existed before. Subsequently, this framework is applied for an integrated model of technology adoption.",

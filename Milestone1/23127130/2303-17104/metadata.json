    "abstract": "In this paper, we explore the integrable fractional derivative nonlinear Schrödinger (fDNLS) equation by using the inverse scattering transform. Firstly, we start from the recursion operator and obtain a formal fDNLS equation. Then the inverse scattering problem is formulated and solved through the matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem. Subsequently, we give the explicit form of the fDNLS equation according to the properties of squared eigenfunctions, such as squared eigenfunctions are the eigenfunctions of the recursion operator of the integrable equations. The reflectionless potential with a simple pole for the zero boundary condition is carried out explicitly by means of determinants. Finally, for the fractional one-soliton solution, we analyze the wave propagation direction and the effect of the small fractional parameter $ε$ on the wave. The fractional one-soliton solution has been verified rigorously. In addition, we also analyze the fractional rational solution obtained by taking the limit of the fractional one-soliton solution.",

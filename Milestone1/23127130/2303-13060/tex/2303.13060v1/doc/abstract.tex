% Reliable layout pattern libraries are the foundation of many lithography design works.
% Establishing practical Layout pattern libraries requires the ability to generate diverse patterns following specific design rules.
% Deep generative models dominate the existing literature in layout pattern generation. 
% However, leaving the guarantee of legality to an inexplicable neural network is not a sound choice. 
% In this paper, we propose DiffPattern to generate reliable layout patterns with three new strategies: 
% 1) A lossless layout pattern representation method dubbed as Deep Squish Pattern for efficient computation. 
% Deep Squish Pattern folds a squish pattern to a compact one with multiple channels to enlarge information density; 
% 2) A novel diverse deep topology generation method on the basis of the discrete diffusion model.
% We flip every pixel in a finite state space with estimated probability instead of thresholding on a continual output;
% 3) A white-box 2D pattern assessment method to transfer a deep topology to a legal pattern given desired design rules. 
% Experiments on the standard benchmark show that DiffPattern significantly outperforms existing baselines and is able to synthesize reliable layout patterns.



% Establishing practical Layout pattern libraries requires the ability to generate diverse patterns following specific design rules.
    Deep generative models dominate the existing literature in layout pattern generation. 
    However, leaving the guarantee of legality to an inexplicable neural network could be problematic in several applications. 
    % In this paper, we propose \tool{DiffPattern} to generate reliable layout patterns with three important properties: 
    % 1) A novel diverse deep topology generation via a discrete diffusion model.
    % 2) A lossless layout pattern representation for efficient computation. 
    % 3) A white-box pattern assessment to generate legal patterns given desired design rules. 
    % Our experiments on several benchmark settings show that \tool{DiffPattern} significantly outperforms existing baselines and is capable of synthesizing reliable layout patterns.
    In this paper, we propose \tool{DiffPattern} to generate reliable layout patterns. \tool{DiffPattern} introduces a novel diverse topology generation method via a discrete diffusion model with compute-efficiently lossless layout pattern representation. Then a white-box pattern assessment is utilized to generate legal patterns given desired design rules. Our experiments on several benchmark settings show that \tool{DiffPattern} significantly outperforms existing baselines and is capable of synthesizing reliable layout patterns.

\section{Concluding remark}
With systematical analyses for two-task and multiple-task CL scenarios, we showed the bias can be transferred both forward and backward by typical CL methods that are oblivious to the dataset bias. 
Furthermore, we appealed to the CL research community to pay attention to the bias-aware CL problem by exhibiting our in-depth analyses, and proposed a simple baseline method for this problem. For future work, we will develop a more principled approach which can accomplish continual learning and debiasing simultaneously.

%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}

Most continual learning (CL) algorithms have focused on tackling the stability-plasticity dilemma, that is, the challenge of preventing the forgetting of previous tasks while learning new ones. However, they have overlooked the impact of the knowledge transfer when the dataset in a certain task is \textit{biased} --- namely, when some unintended spurious correlations of the tasks are learned from the biased dataset. In that case, how would they affect learning future tasks or the knowledge already learned from the past tasks? In this work, we carefully design systematic experiments using one synthetic and two real-world datasets to answer the question from our empirical findings. Specifically, we first show through two-task CL experiments that standard CL methods, which are unaware of dataset bias, can transfer biases from one task to another, both forward and backward, and this transfer is exacerbated depending on whether the CL methods focus on the stability or the plasticity. We then present that the bias transfer also exists and even accumulate in longer sequences of tasks. Finally, we propose a simple, yet strong plug-in method for debiasing-aware continual learning, dubbed as \methodnamefull (\ours). As a result, we show that our \ours can always reduce the bias of a CL model, with a slight loss of CL performance at most.

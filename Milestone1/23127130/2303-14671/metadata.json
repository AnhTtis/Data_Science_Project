    "abstract": "Partial cubes are the graphs which can be embedded into hypercubes. The cube polynomial of a graph $G$ is a counting polynomial of induced hypercubes of $G$, which is defined as $C(G,x):=\\sum_{i\\geqslant 0}α_i(G)x^i$ where $α_i(G)$ is the number of induced $i$-cubes (hypercubes of dimension $i$) of $G$. The clique polynomial of $G$ is defined as $Cl(G,x):=\\sum_{i\\geqslant 0}a_i(G)x^i$ where $a_i(G)$ ($i\\geqslant 1$) is the number of $i$-cliques (complete subgraphs of order $i$) in $G$ and $a_0(G)=1$. Equivalently, $Cl(G, x)$ is exactly the independence polynomial of the complement $\\overline{G}$ of $G$. The crossing graph $G^{\\#}$ of a partial cube $G$ is the graph whose vertices are corresponding to the $Θ$-classes (the equivalent classes of edge set) of $G$, and $θ_1$ and $θ_2$ are adjacent in $G^{\\#}$ if and only if they cross in $G$. In the present paper, we prove that for a partial cube $G$, $C(G,x)\\leqslant Cl(G^{\\#}, x+1)$ and the equality holds if and only if $G$ is a median graph (a special partial cube). Since every graph can be represented as the crossing graph of a median graph [SIAM J. Discrete Math., 15 (2002) 235--251], the above necessary-and-sufficient result shows that the study on the cube polynomials of median graphs can be transformed to the one on the clique polynomials of general graphs (equivalently, on the independence polynomials of their complements). In addition, we disprove the conjecture that the cube polynomials of median graphs are unimodal.",

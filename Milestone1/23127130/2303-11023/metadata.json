    "abstract": "The solutions of traditional fractional differential equations neither satisfy group property nor generate dynamical systems, so the study on hyperbolicity is in blank. Relying on the new proposed conformable fractional derivative, we investigate dichotomy of conformable fractional equations, including structure of solutions of linear systems, Mittag-Leffler dichotomy and stability, roughness and nonuniform dichotomy.",

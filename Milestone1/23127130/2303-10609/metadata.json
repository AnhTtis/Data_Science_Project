    "abstract": "We prove $\\times a$ $\\times b$ measure rigidity for multiplicatively independent pairs when $a\\in\\mathbb{N}$ and $b>1$ is a ``specified'' real number (the $b$-expansion of $1$ has a tail or bounded runs of $0$'s) under a positive entropy condition. This is done by proving a mean decay of the Fourier series of the point masses average along $\\times b$ orbits. We also prove a quantitative version of this decay under stronger conditions on the $\\times a$ invariant measure. The quantitative version together with the $\\times b$ invariance of the limit measure is a step toward a general Host-type pointwise equidistribution theorem in which the equidistribution is for Parry measure instead of Lebesgue. We show that finite memory length measures on the $a$-shift meet the mentioned conditions for mean convergence. Our main proof relies on techniques of Hochman.",

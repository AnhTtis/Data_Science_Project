    "abstract": "Microbial diversity is often discussed in terms of dichotomies such as copiotrophic/oligotrophic and fast/slow-growing microbes. We put these dichotomies in an ecological context by discussing their connections with Monod curves of specific growth rate versus limiting nutrient concentration. We find correspondences between Monod curves for laboratory cultures of isolated microbes and key ecological parameters in McArthur and Wilson r/K selection theory, Tilman resource competition and community structure theory and Grime triangle of life strategies. These parallels allow us in the first place to compare copiotrophic/oligotrophic and fast/slow-growing microbes with well-studied life strategies. Second, standard laboratory experiments can yield quantitative parameters useful for microbial ecology studies. Third, we can partly explain the microbial diversity observed in metagenomic experiments by considering viable carbon sources for heterotrophic microbes in the framework of community structure theory. Fourth, we can reconcile the r/K, copiotrophic/oligotrophic and fast/slow-growing microbes dichotomies as different subsamples of a life strategy triangle. In sum, Monod curves can be a unifying quantitative tool for microbial ecology, calling for the integration of modern laboratory and field experiments and the consideration of growth, mortality and resources in the study of natural microbial communities.",

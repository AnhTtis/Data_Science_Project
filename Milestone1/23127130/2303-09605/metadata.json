    "abstract": "We give a cyclic sieving phenomenon for symplectic $λ$-tableaux, $SP(λ, 2m)$, where $λ$ is a partition of an odd positive integer $n$ and $gcd(m,p)=1$ for any odd prime $p\\leq n$. We use the crystal structure on Kashiwara-Nakashima symplectic tableaux to get a cyclic sieving action as the product of simple reflections in the Weyl group. The cyclic sieving polynomial is the $q$-anologue of the hook-content formula for symplectic tableaux.",

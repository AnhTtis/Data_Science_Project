   abstract = {This paper reviews the literature on Bayesian experimental design. A unified view of this topic is presented, based on a decision-theoretic approach. This framework casts criteria from the Bayesian literature of design as part of a single coherent approach. The decision-theoretic structure incorporates both linear and nonlinear design problems and it suggests possible new directions to the experimental design problem, motivated by the use of new utility functions. We show that, in some special cases of linear design problems, Bayesian solutions change in a sensible way when the prior distribution and the utility function are modified to allow for the specific structure of the experiment. The decision-theoretic approach also gives a mathematical justification for selecting the appropriate optimality criterion. © 1995 by the Institute of Mathematical Statistics.},

abstract = {Conventional geostatistical methodology solves the problem of predicting the realized value of a linear functional of a Gaussian spatial stochastic process S(x) based on observations Yi = S(xi) + Zi at sampling locations xi, where the Zi are mutually independent, zero-mean Gaussian random variables. We describe two spatial applications for which Gaussian distributional assumptions are clearly inappropriate. The first concerns the assessment of residual contamination from nuclear weapons testing on a South Pacific island, in which the sampling method generates spatially indexed Poisson counts conditional on an unobserved spatially varying intensity of radioactivity; we conclude that a conventional geostatistical analysis oversmooths the data and underestimates the spatial extremes of the intensity. The second application provides a description of spatial variation in the risk of campylobacter infections relative to other enteric infections in part of north Lancashire and south Cumbria. For this application, we treat the data as binomial counts at unit postcode locations, conditionally on an unobserved relative risk surface which we estimate. The theoretical framework for our extension of geostatistical methods is that, conditionally on the unobserved process S(x), observations at sample locations xi form a generalized linear model with the corresponding values of S(xi) appearing as an offset term in the linear predictor. We use a Bayesian inferential framework, implemented via the Markov chain Monte Carlo method, to solve the prediction problem for non-linear functionals of S(x), making a proper allowance for the uncertainty in the estimation of any model parameters.},

Both these problems are NP-hard. We prove that (1 - o (1)) ln n is a threshold below which set cover cannot be approximated efficiently, unless NP has slightly superpolynomial time algorithms. This closes the gap (up to low-order terms) between the ratio of approximation achievable by the greedy alogorithm (which is (1 - o (1)) ln n), and provious results of Lund and Yanakakis, that showed hardness of approximation within a ratio of (log 2 n ) / 2 ≃0.72 ln n . For max k -cover, we show an approximation threshold of (1 - 1/ e )(up to low-order terms), under assumption that P ≠ NP .},

@article{Waite2015,
abstract = {The selection of optimal designs for generalized linear mixed models is complicated by the fact that the Fisher information matrix, on which most optimality criteria depend, is computationally expensive to evaluate. We provide two novel approximations that reduce the computational cost of evaluating the information matrix by complete enumeration of response outcomes, or Monte Carlo approximations thereof: an asymptotic approximation that is accurate when there is strong dependence between observations in the same block; and an approximation via kriging interpolators. For logistic random intercept models, we show how interpolation can be especially effective for finding pseudo-Bayesian designs that incorporate uncertainty in the values of the model parameters. The new results are used to evaluate the efficiency, for estimating conditional models, of optimal designs from closed-form approximations to the information matrix derived from marginal models. Correcting for the marginal attenuation of parameters in binary-response models yields much improved designs, typically with very high efficiencies. However, in some experiments exhibiting strong dependence, designs for marginal models may still be inefficient for conditional modelling. Our asymptotic results provide some theoretical insights into why such inefficiencies occur.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of mobile networks and smart terminals, mobile crowdsourcing has aroused the interest of relevant scholars and industries. In this paper, we propose a new solution to the problem of user selection in mobile crowdsourcing system. The existing user selection schemes mainly include: (1) find a subset of users to maximize crowdsourcing quality under a given budget constraint; (2) find a subset of users to minimize cost while meeting minimum crowdsourcing quality requirement. However, these solutions have deficiencies in selecting users to maximize the quality of service of the task and minimize costs. Inspired by the marginalism principle in economics, we wish to select a new user only when the marginal gain of the newly joined user is higher than the cost of payment and the marginal cost associated with integration. We modeled the scheme as a marginalism problem of mobile crowdsourcing user selection (MCUS-marginalism). We rigorously prove the MCUS-marginalism problem to be NP-hard, and propose a greedy random adaptive procedure with annealing randomness (GRASP-AR) to achieve maximize the gain and minimize the cost of the task. The effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approaches are clearly verified by a large scale of experimental evaluations on both real-world and synthetic data sets.},

abstract = {For cluster randomized and multicentre trials evaluating the effect of a treatment on persons nested within clusters, equations have been published to compute the optimal sample sizes at the cluster and person level as a function of sampling costs and intraclass correlation ( ICC). Here, optimal means maximum power and precision for a given sampling budget, or minimum sampling costs for a given power and precision. However, the ICC is usually unknown, and the optimal sample sizes depend strongly on this ICC. To overcome this local optimality problem, this study presents Maximin designs (MMDs) based on relative efficiency (RE) and efficiency. These designs perform well over a range of possible ICC values either in terms of RE compared with the locally optimal designs, or in terms of minimum efficiency (maximum variance) of the treatment effect estimator. The use of MMDs is illustrated using information from many cluster randomized trials in primary care. It is concluded that MMDs and the optimal design for an ICC halfway its assumed range are efficient for a range of ICC values and recommendable for practical use. This requires that trial reports mention the study cost per cluster and person.},

abstract = {Background: Cluster randomized trials (CRTs) are increasingly used to assess the effectiveness of health interventions. Three main analysis approaches are: cluster-level analyses, mixed-models and generalized estimating equations (GEEs). Mixed models and GEEs can lead to inflated type I error rates with a small number of clusters, and numerous small-sample corrections have been proposed to circumvent this problem. However, the impact of these methods on power is still unclear. Methods: We performed a simulation study to assess the performance of 12 analysis approaches for CRTs with a continuous outcome and 40 or fewer clusters. These included weighted and unweighted cluster-level analyses, mixed-effects models with different degree-of-freedom corrections, and GEEs with and without a small-sample correction. We assessed these approaches across different values of the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), numbers of clusters and variability in cluster sizes. Results: Unweighted and variance-weighted cluster-level analysis, mixed models with degree-of-freedom corrections, and GEE with a small-sample correction all maintained the type I error rate at or below 5{\%} across most scenarios, whereas uncorrected approaches lead to inflated type I error rates. However, these analyses had low power (below 50{\%} in some scenarios) when fewer than 20 clusters were randomized, with none reaching the expected 80{\%} power. Conclusions: Small-sample corrections or variance-weighted cluster-level analyses are recommended for the analysis of continuous outcomes in CRTs with a small number of clusters. The use of these corrections should be incorporated into the sample size calculation to prevent studies from being underpowered.},

@article{Kahan2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 The Author(s). Background: Cluster randomised trials (CRTs) are commonly analysed using mixed-effects models or generalised estimating equations (GEEs). However, these analyses do not always perform well with the small number of clusters typical of most CRTs. They can lead to increased risk of a type I error (finding a statistically significant treatment effect when it does not exist) if appropriate corrections are not used. Methods: We conducted a small simulation study to evaluate the impact of using small-sample corrections for mixed-effects models or GEEs in CRTs with a small number of clusters. We then reanalysed data from TRIGGER, a CRT with six clusters, to determine the effect of using an inappropriate analysis method in practice. Finally, we reviewed 100 CRTs previously identified by a search on PubMed in order to assess whether trials were using appropriate methods of analysis. Trials were classified as at risk of an increased type I error rate if they did not report using an analysis method which accounted for clustering, or if they had fewer than 40 clusters and performed an individual-level analysis without reporting the use of an appropriate small-sample correction. Results: Our simulation study found that using mixed-effects models or GEEs without an appropriate correction led to inflated type I error rates, even for as many as 70 clusters. Conversely, using small-sample corrections provided correct type I error rates across all scenarios. Reanalysis of the TRIGGER trial found that inappropriate methods of analysis gave much smaller P values (P≤0.01) than appropriate methods (P=0.04-0.15). In our review, of the 99 trials that reported the number of clusters, 64 (65 {\%}) were at risk of an increased type I error rate; 14 trials did not report using an analysis method which accounted for clustering, and 50 trials with fewer than 40 clusters performed an individual-level analysis without reporting the use of an appropriate correction. Conclusions: CRTs with a small or medium number of clusters are at risk of an inflated type I error rate unless appropriate analysis methods are used. Investigators should consider using small-sample corrections with mixed-effects models or GEEs to ensure valid results.},

abstract = {Accelerating energy consumption and increasing data traffic have become prominent in large-scale wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Compressive sensing (CS) can recover data through the collection of a small number of samples with energy efficiency. General CS theory has several limitations when applied to WSNs because of the high complexity of its [Formula: see text]-based conventional convex optimization algorithm and the large storage space required by its Gaussian random observation matrix. Thus, we propose a novel solution that allows the use of CS for compressive sampling and online recovery of large data sets in actual WSN scenarios. The [Formula: see text]-based greedy algorithm for data recovery in WSNs is adopted and combined with a newly designed measurement matrix that is based on LEACH clustering algorithm integrated into a new framework called data acquisition framework of compressive sampling and online recovery (DAF{\_}CSOR). Furthermore, we study three different greedy algorithms under DAF{\_}CSOR. Results of evaluation experiments show that the proposed sparsity-adaptive DAF{\_}CSOR is relatively optimal in terms of recovery accuracy. In terms of overall energy consumption and network lifetime, DAF{\_}CSOR exhibits a certain advantage over conventional methods.},

abstract = {The stepped wedge cluster randomized design has received increasing attention in pragmatic clinical trials and implementation science research. The key feature of the design is the unidirectional crossover of clusters from the control to intervention conditions on a staggered schedule, which induces confounding of the intervention effect by time. The stepped wedge design first appeared in the Gambia hepatitis study in the 1980s. However, the statistical model used for the design and analysis was not formally introduced until 2007 in an article by Hussey and Hughes. Since then, a variety of mixed-effects model extensions have been proposed for the design and analysis of these trials. In this article, we explore these extensions under a unified perspective. We provide a general model representation and regard various model extensions as alternative ways to characterize the secular trend, intervention effect, as well as sources of heterogeneity. We review the key model ingredients and clarify their implications for the design and analysis. The article serves as an entry point to the evolving statistical literatures on stepped wedge designs.},

abstract = {It has long been recognized that sample size calculations for cluster randomized trials require consideration of the correlation between multiple observations within the same cluster. When measurements are taken at anything other than a single point in time, these correlations depend not only on the cluster but also on the time separation between measurements and additionally, on whether different participants (cross-sectional designs) or the same participants (cohort designs) are repeatedly measured. This is particularly relevant in trials with multiple periods of measurement, such as the cluster cross-over and stepped-wedge designs, but also to some degree in parallel designs. Several papers describing sample size methodology for these designs have been published, but this methodology might not be accessible to all researchers. In this article we provide a tutorial on sample size calculation for cluster randomized designs with particular emphasis on designs with multiple periods of measurement and provide a web-based tool, the Shiny CRT Calculator, to allow researchers to easily conduct these sample size calculations. We consider both cross-sectional and cohort designs and allow for a variety of assumed within-cluster correlation structures. We consider cluster heterogeneity in treatment effects (for designs where treatment is crossed with cluster), as well as individually randomized group-treatment trials with differential clustering between arms, for example designs where clustering arises from interventions being delivered in groups. The calculator will compute power or precision, as a function of cluster size or number of clusters, for a wide variety of designs and correlation structures. We illustrate the methodology and the flexibility of the Shiny CRT Calculator using a range of examples.},

This article examines how to efficiently design clusters where they are geographically defined by demarcating areas incorporating individuals and households or other units. Using geostatistical models for spatial autocorrelation we generate approximations to within cluster average covariance in order to estimate the effective sample size given particular cluster design parameters. We show how the number of enumerated locations, cluster area, proportion sampled, and sampling method affect the efficiency of the design and consider the optimization problem of choosing the most efficient design subject to budgetary constraints. We also consider how the parameters from these approximations can be interpreted simply in terms of `real-world' quantities and used in design analysis.},

abstract = {Stepped wedge designs (SWDs) have received considerable attention recently, as they are potentially a useful way to assess new treatments in areas such as health services implementation. Because allocation is usually by cluster, SWDs are often viewed as a form of cluster-randomized trial. However, since the treatment within a cluster changes during the course of the study, they can also be viewed as a form of crossover design. This article explores SWDs from the perspective of crossover trials and designed experiments more generally. We show that the treatment effect estimator in a linear mixed effects model can be decomposed into a weighted mean of the estimators obtained from(1) regarding an SWDas a conventional row-column design and (2) a so-called vertical analysis, which is a row-column design with row effects omitted. This provides a precise representation of “horizontal” and “vertical” comparisons, respectively, which to date have appeared without formal descrip- tion in the literature. This decomposition displays a sometimes surprising way the analysis corrects for the partial confounding between time and treatment effects. The approach also permits the quantification of the loss of efficiency caused by mis-specifying the correlation parameter in themixed-effectsmodel. Optimal exten- sions of the vertical analysis are obtained, and these are shownto be highly inefficient for values of the within-cluster dependence that are likely to be encountered in prac- tice. Some recently described extensions to the classic SWDincorporating multiple treatments are also compared using the experimental design framework},

abstract = {Background: Cluster randomised trials with unequal sized clusters often have lower precision than with clusters of equal size. To allow for this, sample sizes are inflated by a modified version of the design effect for clustering. These inflation factors are valid under the assumption that randomisation is stratified by cluster size. We investigate the impact of unequal cluster size when that constraint is relaxed, with particular focus on the stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial, where this is more difficult to achieve. Methods: Assuming a multi-level mixed effect model with exchangeable correlation structure for a cross-sectional design, we use simulation methods to compare the precision for a trial with clusters of unequal size to a trial with clusters of equal size (relative efficiency). For a range of scenarios we illustrate the impact of various design features (the cluster-mean correlation-a function of the intracluster correlation and the cluster size, the number of clusters, number of randomisation sequences) on the average and distribution of the relative efficiency. Results: Simulations confirm that the average reduction in precision, due to varying cluster sizes, is smaller in a stepped-wedge trial compared to the parallel trial. However, the variance of the distribution of the relative efficiency is large; and is larger under the stepped-wedge design compared to the parallel design. This can result in large variations in actual power, depending on the allocation of clusters to sequences. Designs with larger variations in cluster sizes, smaller number of clusters and studies with smaller cluster-mean correlations (smaller cluster sizes or smaller intra-cluster correlation) are particularly at risk. Conclusion: The actual realised power in a stepped-wedge trial might be substantially higher or lower than that estimated. This is particularly important when there are a small number of clusters or the variability in cluster sizes is large. Constraining the randomisation on cluster size, where feasible, might mitigate this effect.},

@article{Moerbeek2020,
abstract = {With group randomized trials complete groups of subject are randomized to treatment conditions. Such grouping also occurs in individually randomized trials where treatment is administered in groups. Outcomes may be measured at the level of the subject, but also at the level of the group. The optimal design determines the number of groups and the number of subjects per group in the intervention and control conditions. It is found by taking a budgetary constraint into account, where costs are associated with implementing the intervention and control, and with taking measurements on subject and groups. The optimal design is found such that the effect of treatment is estimated with highest efficiency, and the total costs do not exceed the budget that is available. The design that is optimal for the outcome at the subject level is not necessarily optimal for the outcome at the group level. Multiple-objective optimal designs consider both outcomes simultaneously. Their aim is to find a design that has high efficiencies for both outcome measures. An Internet application for finding the multiple-objective optimal design is demonstrated on the basis of an example from smoking prevention in primary education, and another example on consultation time in primary care.},

@article{Watson2022,
abstract = {We review the use of combinatorial optimisation algorithms to identify approximate c-optimal experimental designs when the assumed data generating process is a generalised linear mixed model and there is correlation both between and within experimental conditions. We show how the optimisation problem can be posed as a supermodular function minimisation problem for which algorithms have theoretical guarantees on their solutions. We compare the performance of four variants of these algorithms for a set of example design problems and also against multiplicative methods in the case where experimental conditions are uncorrelated. We show that a local search starting from either a random design or the output of a greedy algorithm provides good performance with the worst outputs having variance {\$}{\textless}10\backslash{\%}{\$} larger than the best output, and frequently better than {\$}{\textless}1\backslash{\%}{\$}. We extend the algorithms to robust optimality and Bayesian c-optimality problems.},

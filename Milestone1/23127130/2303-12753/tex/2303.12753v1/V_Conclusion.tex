To implement the on-device unsupervised image segmentation, we try the first attempt to apply the HDC to perform segmentation. In this paper, we devise a brand new encoding method for both position and color HVs in accordance with Manhattan distance, and propose a segmentation framework, namely SegHDC. 3 nuclei datasets are employed to evaluate the performance of SegHDC. Results show that SegHDC can significantly improve the IoU score with much less latency on Raspberry Pi compared with the CNN-based unsupervised image segmentation approach.

In this paper, we investigate multi-task learning for predicting multiple adverse neonatal outcomes. In contrast to previous ML-based methods that formulate this problem as a single-task problem, our proposed multi-task learning framework jointly learns several relevant tasks to capture the shared general patterns across various tasks. To implement our idea, we propose an MTL framework with several shared hidden layers followed by task-specific branches, which integrates shared general patterns into the ML models, while remains task-specific information for different adverse neonatal outcomes. Extensive experiments conducted on three primary neonatal outcomes demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-task learning method trained on a limited dataset. We hope our study will draw the community’s attention to the diagnosis of multiple neonatal outcomes for premature infants.
For future work, we plan to investigate the domain adaptation capability of the MTL framework by evaluating its performance on additional test samples obtained from other medical facilities.

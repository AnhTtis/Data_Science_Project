    "abstract": "We introduce the balanced multiple q-zeta values. They give a new model for multiple q-zeta values, whose product formula combines the shuffle and stuffle product for multiple zeta values in a natural way. Moreover, the balanced multiple q-zeta values are invariant under a very explicit involution. Thus, all relations among the balanced multiple q-zeta values are conjecturally of a very simple shape. Examples of the balanced multiple q-zeta values are the classical Eisenstein series, and they also contain the combinatorial multiple Eisenstein series. The construction of the balanced multiple q-zeta values is done on the level of generating series. We introduce a general setup relating Hoffman's quasi-shuffle products to explicit symmetries among generating series of words, which gives a clarifying approach to Ecalle's theory of bimoulds. This allows us to obtain an isomorphism between the underlying Hopf algebras of words related to the combinatorial bi-multiple Eisenstein series and the balanced multiple q-zeta values.",

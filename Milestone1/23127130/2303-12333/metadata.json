    "abstract": "Balancing the conflicting demands of transparency and matte appearance has long been a challenge in optics. Smooth surfaces are necessary for transparency but can result in unwanted specular reflection and glare, while rough structures possess a matte appearance and cause random light scattering and translucency. In this work, we propose a novel solution utilizing optical metasurfaces1-2 to overcome this dilemma. Our approach leverages an asymmetric background in metasurface design to achieve highly asymmetric diffusion of white light, maximizing diffusion in reflection while minimizing it in transmission across the entire visible spectrum. Using industrial lithography, we have created macroscale transparent matte surfaces with both matte appearance and clear transparency, allowing for flexible control over both properties. These surfaces facilitate an effective method of reducing undesired specular reflection and glare on transparent devices. They also have potential applications in transparent display and augmented reality, offering high clarity, wide viewing angles, full color, and one-sided display capabilities. Our findings usher in a new era of optics where the desirable properties of both transparent and translucent materials can be seamlessly merged.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to provide the results that answer the Kuratowski problem posed in 1935 concerning the existence of nonmeasurable sets. The Kuratowski problem was considered for partitions, here we provide a generalization to point-finite families for tree structures and structures in Ellentuck space. The main result of this paper generalizes previous results in the topic of nonmeasurable sets.",

\section{Conclusion}

We discovered the superiority of the two query selectors according to the local heterogeneity level and global imbalance ratio. Based on our findings, the local-only and global models are both crucial since global and local inter-class diversity affects their performance dominance.
To this end, we propose LoGo algorithm that incorporates local-only and global models into macro and micro steps of cluster-based active learning.
LoGo preferentially selects samples that simultaneously alleviate local and global imbalance as a query, making it robust to local and global imbalance.
Our experiments verified that \algname{} consistently outperforms six baselines under comprehensive settings of 38 combinations using six categories.

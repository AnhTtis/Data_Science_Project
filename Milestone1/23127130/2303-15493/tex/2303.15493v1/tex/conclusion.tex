In this paper, we have presented BSC-Net that learns binary sparse convolutional networks for efficient point cloud analysis. We present the shifted sparse convolution that is activated for receptive field whose pre-defined locations match active sites. By searching the optimal positions for active site matching in shifted sparse convolution, the quantization errors in binarized sparse convolutional networks are alleviated significantly without additional computational cost. For fair evaluation, we combine previous techniques to construct a strong baseline. Extensive experiments on semantic segmentation of point clouds demonstrate the superiority of BSC-Net.

    "abstract": "We develop a quantum embedding method that enables accurate and efficient treatment of interactions between molecules and an environment, while explicitly including many-body correlations. The molecule is composed of classical nuclei and quantum electrons, whereas the environment is modeled via charged quantum harmonic oscillators. We construct a general Hamiltonian and introduce a variational ansatz for the correlated ground state of the fully interacting molecule/environment system. This wavefunction is optimized via variational Monte Carlo and the ground state energy is subsequently estimated through diffusion Monte Carlo. The proposed scheme allows an explicit many-body treatment of electrostatic, polarization, and dispersion interactions between the molecule and the environment. We study solvation energies and excitation energies of benzene derivatives, obtaining excellent agreement with explicit ab initio calculations and experiment.",

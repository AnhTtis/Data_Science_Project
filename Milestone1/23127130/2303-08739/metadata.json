    "abstract": "Correlations in quantum networks with independent sources exhibit a completely novel form of nonclassicality in the sense that the nonlocality of such correlations can be demonstrated in fixed local input scenarios. Before the pioneering work by M.O.Renou, et al., in [1], the nonlocal feature of such network correlations was directly attributable to standard Bell nonlocality. In [1], the authors provided some of the first examples of triangle network correlations, whose nonlocality cannot be deduced from Bell-CHSH nonlocality. To date, a complete characterization of such scenarios is yet to be provided. Present work characterizes correlations arising due to fixed local measurements in a triangle network under a source independence assumptions. Precisely speaking, a set of criteria is framed in the form of Bell-type inequalities, each of which is necessarily satisfied by trilocal correlations. Possible quantum violation of at least one criterion from the set is analyzed, which in turn points out the utility of the set of criteria to detect nonlocality (nontrilocality) in quantum triangle networks. Interestingly, measurement on a local product state basis turns out to be sufficient to generate nontrilocal correlations in some quantum networks. Noise tolerance of the detection criteria is discussed followed by a generalization of the framework for demonstrating correlations in any n-sided polygon where n is finite.",

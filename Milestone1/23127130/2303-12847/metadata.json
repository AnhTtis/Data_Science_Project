    "abstract": "In extensions of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics a light scalar from a hidden sector can interact with known particles via mixing with the SM Higgs boson. If the scalar mass is of GeV scale, this coupling induces the scalar decay into light hadrons, that saturates the scalar width. Searches for the light scalars are performed in many ongoing experiments and planned for the next generation projects. Applying dispersion relations changes the leading order estimate of the scalar decay rate into pions by a factor of about a hundred indicating the strong final state interaction. This subtlety for about thirty years prevented any reliable inference of the model parameters from experimental data. In this letter we use the gravitational form factor for neutral pion extracted from analysis of $γ^*γ\\toπ^0π^0$ processes to estimate the quark contribution to scalar decay into two pions. We find a factor of two uncertainty in this estimate and argue that the possible gluon contribution is of the same order. The decay rate to pions smoothly matches that to gluons dominating for heavier scalars. With this finding we refine sensitivities of future projects to the scalar-Higgs mixing. The accuracy in the calculations can be further improved by performing similar analysis of $γ^*γ\\to K K$ and $γ^*γ\\toηη$ processes and possibly decays like $J/ψ\\toγ+ππ$.",

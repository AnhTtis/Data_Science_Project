    "abstract": "We present the construction of standard entanglement-assisted (EA) qubit Reed-Muller (RM) codes and their tensor product variants from classical RM codes. We show that the EA RM codes obtained using the CSS construction have zero coding rate and negative catalytic rate. We further show that EA codes constructed from these same classical RM codes using the tensor product code (TPC) construction have positive coding rate and provide a subclass of EA RM TPCs that have positive catalytic rate, thus establishing the coding analog of superadditivity for this family of codes, useful towards quantum communications. We also generalize this analysis to obtain conditions for EA TPCs from classical codes to have positive catalytic rate when their corresponding EA CSS codes have zero rate.",

\section{Conclusion}
\orange{Printed electronics prevail as a promising solution for a large number of application domains that require ultra low-cost, conformality, low time-to-market, nontoxicity, etc.
Nevertheless, large feature sizes in printed electronics prohibit the implementation of complex circuits.}
To this end, we propose a model-to-circuit cross-approximation built upon bespoke implementations and we demonstrate that our cross-approximation delivers area- and power- efficient approximate printed ML circuits with negligible accuracy loss.
Moreover, we propose a framework to identify, fast-enough, cross-approximated printed ML circuits that satisfy given battery constraints and we show that for 2 out of the 3 examined printed batteries, our framework enables, almost always, battery-operated ML classifiers. 

% cross-layer approximate framework that exploits peculiar printed electronics features and generates optimal approximate printed circuits for ML applications.
% Through a design space exploration, we generate for the first time high accuracy printed ML circuits capable of operating at ultra-low power, paving the way towards more smart complex printed applications.

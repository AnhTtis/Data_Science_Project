    "abstract": "Pure spinor actions of various gauge theories are of Chern-Simons form, and they come with natural $\\text{BV}^{\\square}$-algebra structures that manifest tree-level color-kinematics duality. This has been observed before in arXiv:2112.11452 for the currents of 10D supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. Here, we show that this observation can be extended to the scattering amplitudes as well as to theories with matter. In particular, we show that the BLG, ABJM and ABJ models possess tree-level color-kinematics duality without having to resort to explicit computations. The $\\text{BV}^{\\square}$-algebra structure explicitly contains the kinematic Lie algebra in the form of a derived bracket. However, regularization issues obstruct the seemingly implied lift to the loop level, and we give reasons to believe that this is a general feature of manifestly CK-dual actions close to Yang-Mills theory. We also explain the link of our ordinary gauge-matter CK-duality to the 3-Lie algebra form of CK-duality previously discussed in the literature.",

    "abstract": "We theoretically discuss how Majorana bound states and Majorana chiral propagating states break voltage gauge invariance of electric transport in specific ways. While the breaking of voltage gauge invariance can be generically related to Andreev processes at interfaces, an antisymmetric conductance with respect to the point of equally split bias across a normal-superconductor-normal (NSN) junction is a more specific signal of topologically-protected Majorana modes. These electric signatures are discussed in NSN junctions made with narrow (wire-like) or wide (film-like) magnetic topological insulator slabs with a central proximitized superconducting sector.",

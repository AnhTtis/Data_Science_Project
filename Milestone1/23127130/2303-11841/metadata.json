    "abstract": "We present the discovery of a transiting massive giant planet around TOI-4603, a sub-giant F-type star from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). The newly discovered planet has a radius of $1.042^{+0.038}_{-0.035}$ $R_{J}$, and an orbital period of $7.24599^{+0.00022}_{-0.00021}$ days. Using radial velocity measurements with the PARAS {and TRES} spectrographs, we determined the planet's mass to be $12.89^{+0.58}_{-0.57}$ $M_{J}$, resulting in a bulk density of $14.1^{+1.7}_{-1.6}$ g ${cm^{-3}}$. This makes it one of the few massive giant planets with extreme density and lies in the transition mass region of massive giant planets and low-mass brown dwarfs, an important addition to the population of less than five objects in this mass range. The eccentricity of $0.325\\pm0.020$ and an orbital separation of $0.0888\\pm0.0010$ AU from its host star suggest that the planet is likely undergoing high eccentricity tidal (HET) migration. We find a fraction of heavy elements of $0.13^{+0.05}_{-0.06}$ and metal enrichment of the planet ($Z_{P}/Z_{star}$) of $4.2^{+1.6}_{-2.0}$. Detection of such systems will offer us to gain valuable insights into the governing mechanisms of massive planets and improve our understanding of their dominant formation and migration mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Using numerical relativity simulations with a subgrid dynamo prescription to generate strong initial magnetic fields, we investigate the possibility of launching a jet-like outflow from the hypermassive neutron star (HMNS) during the early stages of the merger, prior to the remnants collapse to a black hole. We demonstrate that buoyant instabilities in the strongly magnetized HMNS can lead to a periodic emission of powerful electromagnetic flares shortly after the merger. These are followed by a collimated mildly relativistic outflow. Both types of outflows feature quasi-periodic kilohertz substructure. These early-time outflows may power precursors to short-duration gamma-ray bursts (SGRB) or in some cases the entire SGRB. While the overall temporal power spectrum we find broadly agrees with the one recently reported for quasi-periodic oscillations in the SGRB GRB910711, our simulations suggest that the periodic electromagnetic substructure is dominated by magnetohydrodynamic shearing processes rather than correlating with the corresponding post-merger gravitational wave signal.",

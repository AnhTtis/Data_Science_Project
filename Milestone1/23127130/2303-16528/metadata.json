    "abstract": "Distributed ledger systems have become more prominent and successful in recent years, with a focus on blockchains and cryptocurrency. This has led to various misunderstandings about both the technology itself and its capabilities, as in many cases blockchain and cryptocurrency is used synonymously and other applications are often overlooked. Therefore, as a whole, the view of distributed ledger technology beyond blockchains and cryptocurrencies is very limited. Existing vocabularies and ontologies often focus on single aspects of the technology, or in some cases even just on one product. This potentially leads to other types of distributed ledgers and their possible use cases being neglected. In this paper, we present a knowledge graph and an ontology for distributed ledger technologies, which includes security considerations to model aspects such as threats and vulnerabilities, application domains, as well as relevant standards and regulations. Such a knowledge graph improves the overall understanding of distributed ledgers, reveals their strengths, and supports the work of security personnel, i.e. analysts and system architects. We discuss potential uses and follow semantic web best practices to evaluate and publish the ontology and knowledge graph.",

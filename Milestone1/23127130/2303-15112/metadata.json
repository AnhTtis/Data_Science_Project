    "abstract": "We consider a mixed analog-to-digital converter (ADC) based architecture for direction of arrival (DOA) estimation using a uniform linear array (ULA). We derive the Cram{é}r-Rao bound (CRB) of the DOA under the optimal time-varying threshold, and find that the asymptotic CRB is related to the arrangement of high-precision and one-bit ADCs for a fixed number of ADCs. Then, a new concept called ``mixed-precision arrangement\" is proposed. It is proven that better performance for DOA estimation is achieved when high-precision ADCs are distributed evenly around the edges of the ULA. This result can be extended to a more general case where the ULA is equipped with various precision ADCs. Simulation results show the validity of the asymptotic CRB and better performance under the optimal mixed-precision arrangement.",

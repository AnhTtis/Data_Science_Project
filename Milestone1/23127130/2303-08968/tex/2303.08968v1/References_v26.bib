	Abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning is gaining popularity in many different fields. An interesting sector is related to the definition of dynamic decision-making systems. A possible example is dynamic portfolio optimization, where an agent has to continuously reallocate an amount of fund into a number of different financial assets with the final goal of maximizing return and minimizing risk. In this work, a novel deep Q-learning portfolio management framework is proposed. The framework is composed by two elements: a set of local agents that learn assets behaviours and a global agent that describes the global reward function. The framework is tested on a crypto portfolio composed by four cryptocurrencies. Based on our results, the deep reinforcement portfolio management framework has proven to be a promising approach for dynamic portfolio optimization.},

	Abstract = {Portfolio traders strive to identify dynamic portfolio allocation schemes that can allocate their total budgets efficiently through the investment horizon. This study proposes a novel portfolio trading strategy in which an intelligent agent is trained to identify an optimal trading action using deep Q-learning. We formulate a Markov decision process model for the portfolio trading process that adopts a discrete combinatorial action space and determines the trading direction at a prespecified trading size for each asset, thus ensuring practical applicability. Our novel portfolio trading strategy takes advantage of three features to outperform other strategies in real-world trading. First, a mapping function is devised to handle and transform any action that is initially proposed but found to be infeasible into a similar and valuable feasible action. Second, by overcoming the dimensionality problem, this study establishes agent and Q-network models to derive a multi-asset trading strategy in the predefined action space. Last, this study introduces a technique that can derive a well-fitted multi-asset trading strategy by designing an agent to simulate all feasible actions in each state. To validate our approach, we conduct backtesting for two representative portfolios and demonstrate superior results over the benchmark strategies.},

This concept is easy to understand, but putting it into practice is far more difficult than it seems. While indexes are typically replicable in theory, index returns are an unattainable ideal, as they ignore the practicalities of portfolio construction and ongoing management. There will always be factors involved in the replication process that will cause mis-tracking, and investors should be aware of these realities and arm themselves with the knowledge of where performance deviations originate and how to measure them.},

In a dynamic setting we address the issue of optimal portfolio rebalancing. We develop an algorithm for determining whether or not to rebalance a given portfolio, based on transaction costs and new information about market conditions.

We establish and solve single- and multi-factor tracking models, and analyze the properties of the optimal portfolios. We find that the optimal factor tracking portfolios consist of factor mimicking portfolios and the minimum-variance portfolio determined in the traditional mean-variance model. Moreover, we derive the condition under which the multi-factor tracking portfolio is a linear convex combination of the corresponding single-factor tracking portfolios. Using various datasets from the US market, we show that the factor tracking portfolios outperform the equally-weighted portfolio, measured by both risk and Sharpe ratio. The superior performance of the factor tracking portfolios are attributed to these portfolios' better upside participation and downside protection.},

This paper proposes to apply deep learning algorithms including deep neural network and deep autoencoder to track index performance and introduces a dynamic weight calculation method to measure the direct effects of the stocks on index. The empirical study takes historical data of Hang Seng Index (HSI) and its constituents to analyze the effectiveness and practicability of the index tracking method. The results show that the index tracking method based on deep neural network has a smaller tracking error, and thus can effectively track the index.},

@article{GuastarobaEtAl2020,
	Abstract = {The enhanced index tracking problem (EITP) calls for the determination of an optimal portfolio of assets with the bi-objective of maximizing the excess return of the portfolio above a benchmark and minimizing the tracking error. The EITP is capturing a growing attention among academics, both for its practical relevance and for the scientific challenges that its study, as a multi-objective problem, poses. Several optimization models have been proposed in the literature, where the tracking error is measured in terms of standard deviation or in linear form using, for instance, the mean absolute deviation. More recently, reward-risk optimization measures, like the Omega ratio, have been adopted for the EITP. On the other side, shortfall or quantile risk measures have nowadays gained an established popularity in a variety of financial applications. In this paper, we propose a class of bi-criteria optimization models for the EITP, where risk is measured using the weighted multiple conditional value-at-risk (WCVaR). The WCVaR is defined as a weighted combination of multiple CVaR measures, and thus allows a more detailed risk aversion modeling compared to the use of a single CVaR measure. The application of the WCVaR to the EITP is analyzed, both theoretically and empirically. Through extensive computational experiments, the performance of the optimal portfolios selected by means of the proposed optimization models is compared, both in-sample and, more importantly, out-of-sample, to the one of the portfolios obtained using another recent optimization model taken from the literature.},

	Abstract = {Index tracking (IT) and enhanced indexing (EI) are two forms of investment strategies which revolve around the movements of the benchmark index. While IT aims to match the performance of the benchmark index, EI intents to outperform the same. In this paper, we seek to design portfolios for IT and EI problems using mixed conditional value at risk (MCVaR). We propose to use the two tail MCVaR (TMCVaR) measure to track the index. Optimizing TMCVaR is a linear program which minimizes the upper deviation and the downside deviation from the benchmark index and hence meets the objective of IT. On the other hand, we propose a two step procedure for EI problem. In step one, we design a discrete Markov chain model to filter a few stocks on the basis of their high probability of gain over the benchmark index. In step two, we assign optimal weights to the filtered assets through maximizing any of the two variants of the STARR ratio with MCVaR or the STARR ratio with deviation MCVaR (DMCVaR). Maximizing the STARR ratio either with MCVaR or DMCVaR is a linear program and hence tractable. We analyze the empirical performance of the proposed models over 17 world-wide indices using the rolling window approach. We consider two IT and four EI models from the literature for a comparative analysis. It is exhibited that the proposed IT model outperforms the other two IT models over several performance measures including higher correlation value with the benchmark index and lower tracking error, and the two proposed EI models outperform the other four EI models in achieving higher excess mean returns from the benchmark index.},

	Abstract = {The main objective in index tracking is to replicate the performance of a target index by using a small subset of its constituents. Non-convex regularization techniques, such as the {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}ell {\_}q{\$}{\$}and the log penalization, which are able to enhance portfolio sparsity by selecting a low number of active weights, recently proved to perform remarkably well in index tracking problems. The resulting non-convex optimization is NP-hard and deterministic optimization methods, such as interior point and gradient projection algorithms, may not efficiently reach the optimal solution due to the presence of multiple local optima and discontinuities in the search space. Therefore, heuristic approaches can be more helpful and easy to implement, thanks to recent hardware development. In this paper, we compare three state-of-the-art estimation techniques, i.e., the interior point, the gradient projection and the coordinate descent algorithms, to a popular heuristic method, the genetic algorithm, in index tracking optimization. We show and evaluate the performance of the four methods in a penalized framework on different simulated settings and on real-world financial data.},

Benchmarking generates additional, inelastic demand for assets inside the benchmark. This leads to a ``benchmark inclusion subsidy:'' a firm inside the benchmark values an investment project more than the one outside. The same wedge arises for valuing M&A, spinoffs, and IPOs. This overturns the proposition that an investment's value is independent of the entity considering it. We describe the characteristics that determine the subsidy, quantify its size (which could be large), and identify empirical work supporting our model's predictions.},

	Abstract = {This paper examines optimization models that use liquidity constraints to track an index. Liquidity is relevant from a risk management perspective but has hardly been explored in the portfolio optimization literature. The liquidity aspect is especially critical in emerging markets. We present two modeling approaches to instill liquidity in index tracking portfolio optimization. The first one defines the portfolio liquidity as the weighted average of assets'liquidities and accounts for financial volume, turnover, and Amihud's metric. The second one models liquidity with the introduction of financial practice parameters related to the liquidation level and the monetary value of the constructed portfolio. An extensive empirical analysis is conducted to replicate two Brazilian stock market indices: Ibovespa and SMLL. As expected, liquidity-constrained portfolios show higher liquidity and higher tracking errors. A counter-intuitive result is observed for the first liquidity-constrained approach in which the number of assets included in the portfolio decreases as the liquidity requirement gets tighter. In the second approach, as liquidity becomes tighter, the number of assets in the portfolio increases. This observation is confirmed by investigating the diversification of the constructed portfolios using the Gini index.},

@article{LehalleSimon2021,
	Abstract = {In the recent years, an intense effort has been dedicated to the research on equity factors. If the academic literature questions their rewarding nature, the financial industry competes for the best portfolio implementation, either in long-short or in long only vehicles. While both solutions try to exploit the same factors while controlling risk, two kinds of managers co-exist in the meantime: fundamental, discretionary stock-pickers, and quantitative, systematic managers. The contribution of this paper is twofold. The core message is that a quantitative long only portfolio, built with any factor as a future returns'proxy and a risk control, ends up to be high conviction portfolios: the long only constraint polarizes naturally the portfolio on a concentrated set of nonzero positions. In this respect, actively managed, quantitative long only portfolios share some similarity with discretionary stock pickers. Beyond this message, and backed by numerical experiments, we derive theoretical results and closed-form formulas to show in addition that: (i) selected stocks are those that realize a trade-off between a low {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}beta{\$}{\$}and a high loading on the factor; (ii) the thresholds driving this selection are endogenous, leading to a recursive procedure to select the stocks. In other words: the portfolio selection problem may be solved linearly instead of using an optimizer. We highlight in particular the crucial role played by low {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}beta{\$}{\$}stocks and by the co-linearity of the risk model with the factor used to forecast returns.},

    "abstract": "Fix an o-minimal structure expanding the ordered field of real numbers. Let $(W_y)_{y\\in\\mathbb{R}^s}$ be a definable family of closed subsets of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ whose total space $W = \\cup_y W_y\\times y$ is a closed connected $C^2$ definable sub-manifold of $\\mathbb{R}^n\\times\\mathbb{R}^s$. Let $\\varphi:W \\to\\mathbb{R}^s$ be the restriction of the projection to the second factor. After defining $K(\\varphi)$, the set of generalized critical values of $\\varphi$, showing that they are closed and definable of positive codimension in $\\mathbb{R}^s$, contain the bifurcation values of $\\varphi$ and are stable under generic plane sections, we prove that all the Lipschitz-Killing curvature densities at infinity $y \\mapsto κ_i^\\infty(W_y)$ are continuous functions over $\\mathbb{R}^s\\setminus K(\\varphi)$. When $W$ is a $C^2$ definable hypersurface of $\\mathbb{R}^n\\times\\mathbb{R}^s$, we further obtain that the symmetric principal curvature densities at infinity $y \\mapsto σ_i^\\infty(W_y)$ are continuous functions over $\\mathbb{R}^s\\setminus K(\\varphi)$.",

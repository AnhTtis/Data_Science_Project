    "abstract": "Complex systems with global interactions tend to be stable if interactions between components are sufficiently homogeneous. In biological systems, which often have small copy numbers and interactions mediated by diffusing agents, noise and non-locality may affect stability. Here, we derive stability criteria for spatial complex systems with local and non-local interactions from a coarse-grained field theory with multiplicative noise. We show that long-range interactions give rise to a transition between regimes exhibiting giant density fluctuations and pattern formation. This instability is suppressed by non-reciprocity in interactions.",

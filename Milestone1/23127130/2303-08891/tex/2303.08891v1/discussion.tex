\section{Discussion and future work}\label{discussion}


We have introduced a novel approach to inverse problems and super-resolution, which incorporates vision transformers with operator learning. Our approach, named ViTO, combines
a U-Net based architecture with a vision transformer. We have obtained comparable or superior results compared to the leading operator network benchmarks
in terms of accuracy, accompanied by substantial efficiency gains.

The impressive performance of ViTO on inverse problems of considerable complexity requires thorough investigation to uncover the mathematical and algorithmic reasons behind it. In particular, we should understand the learning mechanism in the latent space and provide some theoretical background.

Extending ViTO to solve  problems with three spatial dimensions is an avenue worth exploring. Moreover, we need to determine ViTO's ability to adapt to forward problems, especially those that are time-dependent.

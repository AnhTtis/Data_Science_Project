abstract = {We report on an experimental study on the dynamics and fragmentation of water droplets levitated in a sound field exposed to a single laser-induced cavitation bubble. The nucleation of the cavitation bubble leads to a shock wave travelling inside the droplet and reflected from pressure release surfaces. Experiments and simulations study the location of the high negative pressures inside the droplet which result into secondary cavitation. Later, three distinct fragmentation scenarios are observed: rapid atomization, sheet formation and coarse fragmentation. Rapid atomization occurs when the expanding bubble, still at high pressure, ruptures the liquid film separating the bubble from the surrounding air and a shock wave is launched into the surrounding air. Sheet formation occurs due to the momentum transfer of the expanding bubble; for sufficiently small bubbles, the sheet retracts because of surface tension, while larger bubbles may cause the fragmentation of the sheet. Coarse fragmentation is observed after the first collapse of the bubble, where high-speed jets emanate from the surface of the droplet. They are the result of surface instability of the droplet combined with the impulsive pressure generated during collapse. A parameter plot for droplets in the size range between 0.17 and 1.5 mm and laser energies between 0.2 and 4.0 mJ allows the separation of these three regimes.},

abstract = {Liquid jetting and fragmentation are important in many industrial and medical applications. Here, we study the jetting from the surface of single liquid droplets undergoing internal volume oscillations. This is accomplished by an explosively expanding and collapsing vapour bubble within the droplet. We observe jets emerging from the droplet surface, which pinch off into finer secondary droplets. The jetting is excited by the spherical Rayleigh–Taylor instability where the radial acceleration is due to the oscillation of an internal bubble. We study this jetting and the effect of fluid viscosity experimentally and numerically. Experiments are carried out by levitating the droplet in an acoustic trap and generating a laser-induced cavitation bubble near the centre of the droplet. On the simulation side, the volume of fluid method (OpenFOAM) solves the compressible Navier–Stokes equations while accounting for surface tension and viscosity. Both two-dimensional (2-D) axisymmetric and 3-D simulations are performed and show good agreement with each other and the experimental observation. While the axisymmetric simulation reveals how the bubble dynamics results destabilizes the interface, only the 3-D simulation computes the geometrically correct slender jets. Overall, experiments and simulations show good agreement for the bubble dynamics, the onset of disturbances and the rapid ejection of filaments after bubble collapse. Additionally, an analytic model for the droplet surface perturbation growth is developed based on the spherical Rayleigh–Taylor instability analysis, which allows us to evaluate the surface stability over a large parameter space. The analytic model predicts correctly the onset of jetting as a function of Reynolds number and normalized internal bubble energy.},

@article{Biasiori-Poulanges2021,
abstract = {The objective of this study is to develop a basic understanding of the interaction of shock waves with density inhomogeneities. We consider the particular instance of a planar air shock impinging on a spherical water droplet and discuss to what extent this interaction can lead to the inception of cavitation inside the droplet. The effort centers on early phases of the interaction, which are analyzed using both ray theory and a hydrodynamic code. Within the context of ray theory, the occurrence of focusing is examined in detail, and parametric equations are derived for the transmitted wavefront and its multiple internal reflections. It is found that wave patterns predicted by ray calculations compare extremely well with the more accurate numerical solutions from simulations. In particular, it is shown that the internal wavefront assumes a complex time-dependent shape whose dominant feature is the existence of cusp singularities. These singular points are shown to trace out surfaces that are the caustics of the associated system of rays. From the singularities of the energy flux density of the refracted wave, the parametric equations of the caustic surface associated with the kth reflected wavefront are deduced. As a consequence of the focusing process, simulations show the formation of negative-pressure regions in the internal flow field. These low-pressure zones are identified as possible spots at which cavitation may occur, depending on the magnitude of pressure reached. Finally, numerical results provide quantitative information on the dependence of negative-pressure peaks upon incident-shock-wave strength.},

@article{Rossello2022,
abstract = {The inception of a cavitation bubble in a liquid by focusing a short and intense laser pulse near its free surface develops not only an upwards directed jet, but a second jet of opposite direction into the bulk liquid. When the laser is focused a few microns below the surface, the rapid deposition of energy produces a splash, whose later sealing gives origin to two particularly elongated opposing jets. Interestingly, the evolution of the downward jet flowing into the liquid pool has many similarities to that observed in free water entry experiments, e.g. the creation of a slender and stable cavity in the liquid. The downward jet can reach speeds of up to $40$ m s $^{-1}$ and travels distances of more than 15 times the maximum radius of the laser induced cavity before losing momentum. The longer lifetime of this so-called ‘bullet' jet as compared with conventional cavitation based jets, the alignment of the jet perpendicular to the free surface and the possibility of scaling the phenomenon opens up potential applications when generated on small droplets or in shallow liquids. In this work, the underlying mechanisms behind the formation of the bullet jets are initially investigated by performing a set of experiments designed to address specific questions about the phenomenon under study. Those were followed by numerical simulations used to give a quantitative and detailed explanation to the experimental observations.},

@article{Koch2021,
abstract = {Experimental analysis of cavitation bubble dynamics typically uses optical imaging and photographic recording. However, the images are often severely affected by distortions and shadows due to refraction and total reflection of the illuminating light at the liquid–gas interface of the bubble. Optical ray tracing may become a powerful tool for the analysis process by assisting in the comparison of experiments to numerical two-phase flow simulations. The novelty of the present approach consists in digitizing almost the complete experimental arrangement with all its optically relevant elements and objects—including a numerical model of the yet unknown bubble—and numerically photographing the scene via ray tracing. The method is applied to the jetting dynamics of single bubbles collapsing at a solid wall. Here, ray tracing can help in the interpretation of raw experimental data concerning the complex bubble interface deformations and internal structures during the collapse. The precise shape of the highly dynamical bubbles can be inferred, thus ray tracing provides a correction method for velocity values of the liquid jets. Strong evidence is found for the existence of an ultra-short-time, fast jet, exceeding velocities known to date in the field.},

The fast dynamics are associated with extreme states of gas and liquid, especially in the nascent state. This offers a unique setting to probe water and water vapor far-from equilibrium. However, current optical techniques cannot quantify these early states due to contrast and resolution limitations. X-ray holography with single X-ray free-electron laser pulses has now enabled a quasi-instantaneous high resolution structural probe with contrast proportional to the electron density of the object. In this work, we demonstrate cone-beam holographic flash imaging of laser-induced cavitation bubbles in water with nanofocused X-ray free-electron laser pulses. We quantify the spatial and temporal pressure distribution of the shockwave surrounding the expanding cavitation bubble at time delays shortly after seeding and compare the results to numerical simulations.},

@article{Blake2015,
abstract = {Cavitation and bubble dynamics have a wide range of practical applications in a range of disciplines, including hydraulic, mechanical and naval engineering, oil exploration, clinical medicine and sonochemistry. However, this paper focuses on how a fundamental concept, the Kelvin impulse, can provide practical insights into engineering and industrial design problems. The pathway is provided through physical insight, idealized experiments and enhancing the accuracy and interpretation of the computation. In 1966, Benjamin and Ellis made a number of important statements relating to the use of the Kelvin impulse in cavitation and bubble dynamics, one of these being ‘One should always reason in terms of the Kelvin impulse, not in terms of the fluid momentum{\ldots}'. We revisit part of this paper, developing the Kelvin impulse from first principles, using it, not only as a check on advanced computations (for which it was first used!), but also to provide greater physical insights into cavitation bubble dynamics near boundaries (rigid, potential free surface, two-fluid interface, flexible surface and axisymmetric stagnation point flow) and to provide predictions on different types of bubble collapse behaviour, later compared against experiments. The paper concludes with two recent studies involving (i) the direction of the jet formation in a cavitation bubble close to a rigid boundary in the presence of high-intensity ultrasound propagated parallel to the surface and (ii) the study of a ‘paradigm bubble model' for the collapse of a translating spherical bubble, sometimes leading to a constant velocity high-speed jet, known as the Longuet-Higgins jet.},

@article{TOMITA2002,
abstract = {Laser-induced cavitation bubbles near a curved rigid boundary are observed experimentally using high-speed photography. An image theory is applied to obtain information on global bubble motion while a boundary integral method is employed to gain a more detailed understanding of the behaviour of a liquid jet that threads a collapsing bubble, creating a toroidal bubble. Comparisons between the theory and experiment show that when a comparable sized bubble is located near a rigid boundary the bubble motion is significantly influenced by the surface curvature of the boundary, which is characterized by a parameter $\zeta$, giving convex walls for $\zeta$ < 1, concave walls for $\zeta$ > 1 and a flat wall when $\zeta$ = 1. If a boundary is slightly concave, the most pronounced migration occurs at the first bubble collapse. The velocity of a liquid jet impacting on the far side of the bubble surface tends to increase with decreasing parameter $\zeta$. In the case of a convex boundary, the jet velocity is larger than that generated in the flat boundary case. Although the situation considered here is restricted to axisymmetric motion without mean flow, this result suggests that higher pressures can occur when cavitation bubbles collapse near a non-flat boundary. Bubble separation, including the pinch-off phenomenon, is observed in the final stage of the collapse of a bubble, with the oblate shape at its maximum volume attached to the surface of a convex boundary, followed by bubble splitting which is responsible for further bubble proliferation.},

The tip of the crown breaks up into fine spray some of which is sucked back into the growing cavity at about 100 m/s. We measure the size of the typical spray droplets to be about 3 $\mu$m.

High-speed imaging reveals the pathways through which droplet fragmentation occurs and three distinct regimes of bubble–droplet interaction are identified: deformation , external emulsification and internal emulsification . We have observed that during the bubble collapse, the droplet elongates towards the bubble, which acts as a flow sink pulling on the droplet. For silicone oils with higher viscosity, the droplet jets into the cavitation bubble and forms a satellite water droplet in the continuous oil phase. In contrast, for lower-viscosity oils, the droplet encapsulates the collapsing bubble as it jets inside and undergoes multiple cycles of expansion and collapse. These internal bubble collapses create tiny oil droplets inside the parent water droplet. The kinematic viscosity of the silicone oil, maximum bubble diameter and centre-to-centre distance between the bubble and the droplet are varied. The regimes are separated in a parameter space set up by the non-dimensional distance and a cavitation Reynolds number.},

abstract = {The collapse of a laser-induced vapor bubble near a solid boundary usually ends in a liquid jet. When the boundary is from a soft material the jetting may pierce the liquid-solid interface and result in the injection of liquid into it. A particular impulsive jet flow can be generated when a laser pulse is focused just below the free surface of a thin liquid layer covering a gelatin sample used as a surrogate of biological tissue. Here, a downwards jet forms from a liquid splash at the free surface and then penetrates through the liquid layer into the soft boundary. In the present manuscript we report on the use of this novel jet, termed “bullet” jet, to pierce soft materials and we explore its potential to become an optical needle-free injection platform. The dynamics and depth of the injection is studied as a function of the elasticity of the solid and the liquid properties. Injections of up to 4 mm deep into 4p w/w gelatin within 0.5 ms are observed. The advantages of the bullet jet over other kinds of impulsively generated jets with lasers are discussed.},

@article{Supponen2016,
abstract = {Fast liquid jets, called micro-jets, are produced within cavitation bubbles experiencing an aspherical collapse. Here we review micro-jets of different origins, scales and appearances, and propose a unified framework to describe their dynamics by using an anisotropy parameter $\unicode[STIX]{x1D701}\geqslant 0$ , representing a dimensionless measure of the liquid momentum at the collapse point (Kelvin impulse). This parameter is rigorously defined for various jet drivers, including gravity and nearby boundaries. Combining theoretical considerations with hundreds of high-speed visualisations of bubbles collapsing near a rigid surface, near a free surface or in variable gravity, we classify the jets into three distinct regimes: weak, intermediate and strong. Weak jets ( $\unicode[STIX]{x1D701}<10^{-3}$ ) hardly pierce the bubble, but remain within it throughout the collapse and rebound. Intermediate jets ( $10^{-3}<\unicode[STIX]{x1D701}<0.1$ ) pierce the opposite bubble wall close to the last collapse phase and clearly emerge during the rebound. Strong jets ( $\unicode[STIX]{x1D701}>0.1$ ) pierce the bubble early during the collapse. The dynamics of the jets is analysed through key observables, such as the jet impact time, jet speed, bubble displacement, bubble volume at jet impact and vapour-jet volume. We find that, upon normalising these observables to dimensionless jet parameters, they all reduce to straightforward functions of $\unicode[STIX]{x1D701}$ , which we can reproduce numerically using potential flow theory. An interesting consequence of this result is that a measurement of a single observable, such as the bubble displacement, suffices to estimate any other parameter, such as the jet speed. Remarkably, the dimensionless parameters of intermediate and weak jets ( $\unicode[STIX]{x1D701}<0.1$ ) depend only on $\unicode[STIX]{x1D701}$ , not on the jet driver (i.e. gravity or boundaries). In the same regime, the jet parameters are found to be well approximated by power laws of $\unicode[STIX]{x1D701}$ , which we explain through analytical arguments.},

abstract = {The dynamics of a bubble near a local axisymmetric convexity or concavity, cosine-like in the axial section, on a plane rigid wall is studied under conditions of formation of a cumulative liquid jet directed to the wall. The study is performed by the boundary element method. Our main attention is focused on the bubble collapse characteristics at the moment t c when the jet impacts on the bubble surface part near the wall, namely, on the jet tip velocity and radius, the internal bubble pressure, the distance between the bubble and the uneven region of the wall, and so on. These characteristics are of interest since they, to a large extent, determine the destructive potential of cavitation. The dependences of these characteristics on the radius of the non-plane region of the wall, the depth of the concave region, the height of the convex region, and the local character of the wall unevenness have been investigated. To estimate the effect of the local character of the wall unevenness, the cases of completely concave and convex walls in the form of blunt conical surfaces are used for comparison. It has been found, in particular, that with changing radius of the convex region of the wall, the bubble shape at the moment t c varies significantly: the shape diversity includes the profiles with a gas microcavity in front of the impacting jet tip, an emerging second oppositely directed jet, and a relatively large area of the jet tip impact at its beginning.},

When the bubble is generated close to the flat top along the axis of the cylinder and its maximum radius exceeds the one of the flat top surface, it collapses in the form of a mushroom with a footing on the cylinder, a long stem and a hat-like cap typical for a mushroom head. The head may collapse forming a thin, fast liquid jet into the stem, depending on bubble size and bubble distance to the top of the cylinder. Several experimental and numerical examples are given.

abstract = {In this study, we studied the dynamics of a laser-induced single cavitation bubble near a rigid cylindrical rod. We experimentally and numerically investigated the effects of the cylindrical rod on the dynamics of the growth and collapse of the single bubble at different relative wall distances. First, we performed the experiments using a high-speed camera to analyze the shape of the bubble collapse qualitatively. Second, we performed a numerical simulation using a fully compressible two-phase mixture model and an interface capturing scheme to analyze the dynamics of the single cavitation bubble. We analyzed different quantitative parameters, such as maximum velocity of the microjet and the pressure impact load for the bubble at various relative wall distances. The results showed that the bubble dynamics collapsing near the cylindrical rod differed significantly from the single bubble collapse near solid flat plates. A shape of mushroom can be formed during the collapse of the single bubble near the cylindrical rod at the smaller relative wall distances, such as $\gamma$ = 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5. This mushroom-shaped bubble was not observed for the cases near the solid flat plates in the previous research or near the higher relative wall distances in our present results. In addition, our numerical results revealed that a mushroom-shaped bubble for the cases $\gamma$ = 0.4, 0.5, and 0.7 may induce a lower jet impact load near the solid surface compared with the case $\gamma$ = 1.0 with an oval-shaped bubble near the solid boundary.},

@article{Reese2022,
abstract = {A cavitation bubble expanding and collapsing near a rigid boundary develops a directed jet flow towards the boundary. In the case of a perforated plate, some of the jet flow passes through the plate and thus the bubble acts as a pump transporting liquid from one side of the plate to the opposite side. The transport is rather complex, is time dependent and varies with the geometric parameters of the bubble and the connecting channel. Therefore, we first model the transport of liquid through a perforated rigid plate for a large range of parameters and then compare some regimes with experiments using single laser-induced bubbles. The simulations are based on a Volume-of-Fluid solver in OpenFOAM and account for surface tension, compressibility and viscosity. The resulting flux and generated velocity in the channel obtained in the simulations are discussed with regards to the dependence of the channel geometry, liquid viscosity and stand-off distance of the bubble to the plate. In general, high flow rates are achieved for long cylindrical channels that have a similar width as the jet produced by the collapsing bubble. At low stand-off distances combined with thick plates, an annular inflow creates a fast and thin jet, also called needle jet , which is approximately a magnitude faster and significantly thinner than the usually encountered microjet. In contrast, for thin plates and small stand-off distances, liquid is pumped in the opposite direction via a reverse jet .},

@article{Plesset1971,
abstract = {Vapour bubble collapse problems lacking spherical symmetry are solved here using a numerical method designed especially for these problems. Viscosity and compressibility in the liquid are neglected. Two specific cases of initially spherical bubbles collapsing near a plane solid wall were simulated: a bubble initially in contact with the wall, and a bubble initially half its radius from the wall at the closest point. It is shown that the bubble develops a jet directed towards the wall rather early in the collapse history. Free surface shapes and velocities are presented at various stages in the collapse. Velocities are scaled like ($\Delta$p/$\rho$)½ where $\rho$ is the density of the liquid and $\Delta$p is the constant difference between the ambient liquid pressure and the pressure in the cavity. For $\Delta$p/$\rho$=10 6 cm 2/ sec 2≈1atm/density of water the jet had a speed of about 130m/sec in the first case and 170m/sec in the second when it struck the opposite side of the bubble. Such jet velocities are of a magnitude which can explain cavitation damage. The jet develops so early in the bubble collapse history that compressibility effects in the liquid and the vapour are not important.},

@article{Zhang2020,
abstract = {In the present paper, the collapsing dynamics of a laser-induced cavitation bubble near the edge of a rigid wall is experimentally investigated with a high-speed photography system. For a symmetrical setup, the two primary control parameters of the bubble collapsing behavior include the equivalent maximum bubble radius and the distance between the bubble and the edge of the rigid wall. Based on the bubble interface deformation during the collapsing process, three typical cases are identified for the categorization of the phenomenon with the influences of the parameters revealed. Through a quantitative analysis of the obtained high-speed photos, the motions of the bubble interface in different directions are given together with the calculations of the bubble centroid. The primary findings of the present paper could be summarized in terms of the bubble-edge distance as follows. When the bubble is close to the edge, the movement of the bubble interface near the edge will be restricted with a clear neck formation in the middle part of the bubble. For this case, the edge could delay the bubble collapsing time up to 22 of the Rayleigh collapsing time. When the bubble is of the medium distance to the edge, the differences of the expansion or shrinkage of the bubble interface among different directions will be reduced with an olive-shaped bubble formed during the collapsing process. For this range of parameters, the bubble moves rapidly toward the edge especially during the final collapsing stage. When the bubble is far away from the edge, the bubble will be a nearly spherical one.},

@article{Brujan2001,
abstract = {The interaction of a laser-induced cavitation bubble with an elastic boundary is investigated experimentally by high-speed photography and acoustic measurements. The elastic material consists of a polyacrylamide (PAA) gel whose elastic properties can be controlled by modifying the water content of the sample. The elastic modulus, E , is varied between 0.017 MPa and 2.03 MPa, and the dimensionless bubble–boundary distance, $\gamma$, is for each value of E varied between $\gamma$ = 0 and $\gamma$ = 2.2. In this parameter space, jetting behaviour, jet velocity, bubble migration and bubble oscillation time are determined. The jetting behaviour varies between liquid jet formation towards or away from the elastic boundary, and formation of an annular jet which results in bubble splitting and the subsequent formation of two very fast axial liquid jets flowing in opposite directions. The liquid jet directed away from the boundary reaches a maximum velocity between 300 ms −1 and 600 ms −1 (depending on the elastic modulus of the sample) while the peak velocity of the jet directed towards the boundary ranges between 400 ms −1 and 800 ms −1 (velocity values averaged over 1 $\mu$s). Penetration of the elastic boundary by the liquid jet is observed for PAA samples with an intermediate elastic modulus between 0.12 and 0.4 MPa. In this same range of elastic moduli and for small $\gamma$-values, PAA material is ejected into the surrounding liquid due to the elastic rebound of the sample surface that was deformed during bubble expansion and forms a PAA jet upon rebound. For stiffer boundaries, the bubble behaviour is mainly characterized by the formation of an axial liquid jet and bubble migration directed towards the boundary, as if the bubble were adjacent to a rigid wall. For softer samples, the bubble behaviour becomes similar to that in a liquid with infinite extent. During bubble collapse, however, material is torn off the PAA sample when bubbles are produced close to the boundary. We conclude that liquid jet penetration into the boundary, jet-like ejection of boundary material, and tensile-stress-induced deformations of the boundary during bubble collapse are the major mechanisms responsible for cavitation erosion and for cavitation-enhanced ablation of elastic materials as, for example, biological tissues.},

The elasticity of tissue is modeled through the inclusion of a pressure term in the dynamic boundary condition at the interface between the two fluids. Weakly viscous effects are considered using viscous potential flow theory. The numerical model is validated by comparison with the theoretical results of the Rayleigh-Plesset equation for spherical bubbles, the numerical results for acoustic bubbles in an unbounded flow, and the experimental images for a spark generated bubble in a rigid circular cylinder. Numerical analyses are then performed for the bubble oscillation, jet formation and penetration through the bubble, and the deformation of the vessel wall in terms of the ultrasound amplitude and the vessel radius.},

abstract = {The strong bubble interactions and bursting behaviors near a free surface are studied numerically with a compressible two-phase flow solver. The interface is captured by the volume of fluid method. We investigate the effects of the dimensionless distance between the bubble and the free surface $\gamma$f (scaled by the maximum bubble radius) ranging from 0.25 to 1.5. For the nonbursting cases, the essential evolution of the toroidal bubble is well captured, including the splitting, coalescence, and recollapse. Generally, a relatively thin spike is generated at the free surface during the first cycle of the bubble. Subsequently, a wider secondary spike at the base of the first spike is formed during the second bubble cycle, which leads to the formation of the crown-shaped spike. When $\gamma$f is sufficiently small, the bubble bursts at the free surface and an opening cavity is generated. The pressure inside the cavity and the atmospheric pressure are not balanced immediately, and the pressure difference lasts for a while, causing the inward gas flow and the final closure of the cavity. The gas flow is found to play a vital role in the bubble bursting behaviors, which has not been well understood. By comparing with previous studies, three distinct bursting patterns are identified and discussed.},

For an incomplete boundary, such as a ship structure broken by the shock wave from underwater explosion attack, the bubble load formed after the shock wave may cause secondary damage to it, and the jet characteristics generated during the bubble collapse are worth exploring. Based on the incompressible potential flow method, a boundary integral method with axisymmetric code is employed to investigate the jet features of the bubble under the combined action of a free surface above and a fixed plate with a centric circular opening below. For the numerical divergence caused by the expanding bubble infinitely approaching the rim of the circular opening, the bubble walls above and below the opening are, respectively, fused with the rigid wall, and the initial infinite flow field surrounding the bubble is then divided into two independent basins that are both required to be solved. Several experiments of a spark-generated bubble oscillating near a free surface and a rigid plate with a circular opening are conducted and the numerical results are validated. Following that, two typical cases with a dominant jet, respectively, directing upward and downward are analysed in detail, and some new phenomena are discovered. Additionally, another particular case that the upward and downward jet collides in the vicinity of the opening centroid is also presented. Finally, the initial bubble-free surface distance effects upon the bubble movement and the jet developments are analysed and discussed.},

High surface pressure and shear stress induced by this jet can damage, or clean, the surface. More complex geometries will result in changes in collapse behaviour, in particular the direction of the jet. The majority of prior research has focused on simple flat boundaries or cases with limited complexity. There is currently very little known about how complex geometries affect bubble collapse. We numerically and experimentally investigate how a slot in a flat boundary affects the jet direction for a single bubble. We use a boundary element model to predict how the jet direction depends on key geometric parameters and show that the results collapse to a single curve when the parameters are normalised appropriately. We then experimentally validate the predictions using laser-induced cavitation and compare the experimental results to the predicted dependencies. This research reveals a tendency for the jet to be directed away from a slot and shows that the jet direction is independent of slot height for slots of sufficient height.},

abstract = {In this study, we establish a full coupling model (FCM) to simulate strong bubble-sphere interactions based on a three-dimensional boundary integral method. Different from the conventional loose coupling model (LCM), FCM adopts several auxiliary functions to deal with the mutual dependence between the hydrodynamic force and the sphere acceleration. In addition, the weighted moving least square method, a mesh density control scheme and an adaptive mesh refinement scheme are implemented to improve the quality of mesh on the deformable bubble surface. To validate the present model, convergence tests on different mesh sizes and time steps are conducted at first. The numerical results are also compared with the axisymmetric model, in which consistent results have been achieved. We further make comparisons between the numerical results and those from several experiments under different boundary conditions. For weak interaction cases, both LCM and FCM can give the results that have good agreement with the experiment data. As the interaction effects become stronger, the advantage of the FCM over the LCM becomes increasingly obvious. Particularly, when the pulsating bubble is in contact with the sphere surface, the essential physical features of the experiments can be well reproduced by the FCM while the predictions by the LCM are significantly different from the experiment. The present 3D model can be further extended to study more complex underwater contact explosions, cavitation inception on a structure and airgun bubble dynamics.},

abstract = {Cavitation bubble collapse close to a submerged sphere on a microscale is investigated numerically using a finite volume method in order to determine the likelihood of previously suspected mechanical effects to cause bacterial cell damage, such as impact of a high speed water jet, propagation of bubble emitted shock waves, shear loads, and thermal loads. A grid convergence study and validation of the employed axisymmetric numerical model against the Gilmore's equation is performed for a case of a single microbubble collapse due to a sudden ambient pressure increase. Numerical simulations of bubble-sphere interaction corresponding to different values of nondimensional bubble-sphere standoff distance $\delta$ and their size ratio $\epsilon$ are carried out. The obtained results show vastly different bubble collapse dynamics across the considered parameter space, from the development of a fast thin annular jet towards the sphere to an almost spherical bubble collapse. Although some similarities in bubble shape progression to previous studies on larger bubbles exist, it can be noticed that bubble jetting is much less likely to occur on the considered scale due to the cushioning effects of surface tension on the intensity of the collapse. Overall, the results show that the mechanical loads on a spherical particle tend to increase with a sphere-bubble size ratio $\epsilon$, and decrease with their distance $\delta$. Additionally, the results are discussed with respect to bacteria eradication by hydrodynamic cavitation. Potentially harmful mechanical effects of bubble-sphere interaction on a micro scale are identified, namely the collapse-induced shear loads with peaks of a few megapascals and propagation of bubble emitted shock waves, which could cause spatially highly variable compressive loads with peaks of a few hundred megapascals and gradients of 100 MPa/$\mu$m.},

abstract = {The jetting behaviour and migratory characteristics of a laser-induced cavitation bubble in a rectangular channel are investigated both experimentally and numerically, for various combinations of the geometric and physical parameters of the system. High-speed photography is used to visualize the temporal development of the bubble shape, the formation of liquid jets during bubble collapse, and the bubble displacement in contact with the sidewalls of the channel during two oscillation cycles of the bubble. The bubble profiles, pressure contours and velocity vectors ambient to the bubble are obtained through numerical simulation results by using an Eulerian finite element method with a compressible liquid impact model. The jetting behaviour of the bubble varies between single jet formation and the formation of three liquid jets directed towards each wall of the channel. The numerical calculations indicate that the liquid jets directed towards the sidewalls of the channel reach maximum velocities of 100 m s −1 while the peak velocity of the liquid jet directed towards the channel endwall is about 55 m s −1 . A small bubble generated close to a sidewall of the channel develops only a single inclined jet during collapse. Such jets can reach velocities of up to 110 m s −1 . A bubble displacement in contact with the sidewalls of the channels of 350 $\mu$m was observed during the first two oscillation cycles for a bubble with a maximum diameter slightly smaller than the height of the channel. The results of our investigations are compared to previous results obtained in similar configurations.},

@article{Gonzalez-Avila2011,
abstract = {We report on an experimental study of cavitation bubble dynamics within sub-millimetre-sized narrow gaps. The gap height is varied, while the position of the cavitation event is fixed with respect to the lower gap wall. Four different sizes of laser-induced cavitation bubbles are studied using high-speed photography of up to 430,000 frames per second. We find a strong influence of the gap height, H , on the bubble dynamics, in particular on the collapse scenario. Also, similar bubble dynamics was found for the same non-dimensional gap height $\eta$ = H/R x , where R x is the maximum radius in the horizontal direction. Three scenarios are observed: neutral collapse at the gap centre, collapse onto the lower wall and collapse onto the upper wall. For intermediate gap height the bubble obtains a conical shape 1.4 < $\eta$ < 7.0. For large distances, $\eta$ > 7.0, the bubble no longer feels the presence of the upper wall and collapses hemispherically. The collapse time increases with respect to the expansion time for decreasing values of $\eta$. Due to the small scales involved, the final stage of the bubble collapse could not be resolved temporally and numerical simulations were performed to elucidate the details of the flow. The simulations demonstrate high-speed jetting towards the upper and lower walls and complex bubble splitting for neutral collapses.},

@article{Kyriazis2018,
abstract = {The impact of liquid droplets on solid surfaces at conditions inducing cavitation inside their volume has rarely been addressed in the literature. A review is conducted on relevant studies, aiming to highlight the differences from non-cavitating impact cases. Focus is placed on the numerical models suitable for the simulation of droplet impact at such conditions. Further insight is given from the development of a purpose-built compressible two-phase flow solver that incorporates a phase-change model suitable for cavitation formation and collapse; thermodynamic closure is based on a barotropic Equation of State (EoS) representing the density and speed of sound of the co-existing liquid, gas and vapour phases as well as liquid-vapour mixture. To overcome the known problem of spurious oscillations occurring at the phase boundaries due to the rapid change in the acoustic impedance, a new hybrid numerical flux discretization scheme is proposed, based on approximate Riemann solvers; this is found to offer numerical stability and has allowed for simulations of cavitation formation during drop impact to be presented for the first time. Following a thorough justification of the validity of the model assumptions adopted for the cases of interest, numerical simulations are firstly compared against the Riemann problem, for which the exact solution has been derived for two materials with the same velocity and pressure fields. The model is validated against the single experimental data set available in the literature for a 2-D planar drop impact case. The results are found in good agreement against these data that depict the evolution of both the shock wave generated upon impact and the rarefaction waves, which are also captured reasonably well. Moreover, the location of cavitation formation inside the drop and the areas of possible erosion sites that may develop on the solid surface, are also well captured by the model. Following model validation, numerical experiments have examined the effect of impact conditions on the process, utilizing both planar and 2-D axisymmetric simulations. It is found that the absence of air between the drop and the wall at the initial configuration can generate cavitation regimes closer to the wall surface, which significantly increase the pressures induced on the solid wall surface, even for much lower impact velocities. A summary highlighting the open questions still remaining on the subject is given at the end.},

A schlierentechnique and streak photography were used to follow the propagation ofthe shock wave. The shock position r as a function oftime was extracted from the streak images by digital image-processingtechniques. The resulting r(t) curves weredifferentiated with respect to time to yield shock-wave velocities thatwere converted to shock pressures with the aid of the equation of thestate of the medium. Features and limitations of the technique aredemonstrated and discussed on the basis of measurements of shock-waveamplitudes generated by laser-induced breakdown in water. For thispurpose, laser pulses of 6-ns duration and pulse energies of 1 and 10mJ were focused into a cuvette containing water. Completep(t) curves were obtained with a temporal resolution inthe subnanosecond range. The total acquisition and processing timefor a single event is $\sim$2 min. The shock-peak pressures at thesource were found to be 8.4 {\textpm} 1.5 and 11.8 {\textpm} 1.6 GPa forpulse energies of 1 and 10 mJ, respectively. Within the first twosource radii, the shock-wave pressure p(r) was found todecay on average in proportion to r-1.3{\textpm}0.2for both pulse energies. Thereafter the pressure dropped inproportion to r-2.2{\textpm}0.1. In water themethod can be used to measure shock-wave amplitudes exceeding 0.1GPa. Because it is a single-shot technique, the method isespecially suited for investigating events with large statisticalvariations.},

Expressed in general terms, the explanation put forward is: the sound-waves cling to the concave surface of the wall and travel circumferentially along it, suffering a diminution of intensity relatively small in comparison with that of waves spherically diverging from the source. The theory was supported by the observation that the effects under consideration are most noticeable when a <italic>directed</italic> source of sound is used and placed close to the curved surface, with its maximum emission in a direction tangential to it. An experimental illustration of the theory was also put forward, using a semicircular reflector of sheet metal, with a bird-call as a source of sound of short wave-length, and a high-pressure sensitive flame as detector. With this apparatus, a small obstacle placed close to the concave surface is competent to intercept most of the effect. Some recent experiments of Barton and Kilby, illustrating the matter further, by the aid of dust-figures produced by electric sparks, may also be mentioned.

ABSTRACT = {Packed beds are employed in a wide range of industrial processes, making their optimization an important objective. This requires a thorough understanding of the flow characteristics in the interstices of the bed and the influence of parameters such as packing material, fluid type and flow rate. Next to numerical simulations that have been performed, liquid flows in packed beds have been experimentally investigated by Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), with optical accessibility obtained using refractive index matching and transparent geometries. For gaseous flows through packed beds, where refractive index matching is not available, there is, in contrast, still a lack of experimental work, because the different optical properties of gas and transparent packing geometries generate optical aberrations. The approximation of gaseous flows with results from dynamically similar, liquid flows provide thereby no reliable alternative because they might be inaccurate and lead to incorrect conclusions about the actual gas flow. The high optical aberrations created by transparent packed beds in PIV experiments can be corrected using ray tracing simulations of a geometric-optical model of the viewing media. The present work proposes a novel image correction technique based on this approach that overcomes the considerable optical distortions caused by arrangements of transparent solid spheres. We analyze the influence of spheres along the camera view in three test cases: the first studies optical distortions of target images, the second PIV computations of a known displacement of a printed particle field, and the third PIV measurements of an air-jet flow. The image correction is qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated by computing errors in target images and in velocity fields. We show that the high optical aberrations that are caused by the spheres can mostly be corrected using ray tracing, allowing for accurate optical measurements in complex geometries, such as packed beds. The approach proposed in this work might be extended to even more challenging geometries in order to solve limitations of existing techniques in the literature.},

abstract = {Shock wave trains in liquid jets were previously generated only by ablation with femtosecond x-ray lasers. Here we show that shock trains in water microjets can be also generated using nanosecond green laser pulses with 1- to 10-mJ energy. The ablation of 15-, 20-, 30-, and 70-$\mu$m water microjets opened a gap in the jets and launched an initial shock wave. Fully developed shock trains were observed in the 30- and 70-$\mu$m jets up to 250-ns delays, and these trains were also transmitted inside the nozzles. A few tens of nanoseconds after the pulse, the shock dynamics and its pressure became similar to the ones generated by x-ray lasers, with a more rapid pressure decay in thinner jets. At time delays exceeding 100 ns in the 30-$\mu$m jets, the leading shock pressure stabilized to an approximately constant pressure of 40 MPa. The energy density deposited in the jets was estimated at 30 MJ/cm3 by comparing the jet gaps in the green and x-ray laser experiments, and matched previous estimates for optical ablation in water. The pressure decay in the 30-$\mu$m jets was modeled based on the pressure decay observed in x-ray laser experiments.},

abstract = {X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) have opened up unprecedented opportunities for time-resolved nano-scale imaging with X-rays. Near-field propagation-based imaging, and in particular near-field holography (NFH) in its high-resolution implementation in cone-beam geometry, can offer full-field views of a specimen's dynamics captured by single XFEL pulses. To exploit this capability, for example in optical-pump/X-ray-probe imaging schemes, the stochastic nature of the self-amplified spontaneous emission pulses, i.e. the dynamics of the beam itself, presents a major challenge. In this work, a concept is presented to address the fluctuating illumination wavefronts by sampling the configuration space of SASE pulses before an actual recording, followed by a principal component analysis. This scheme is implemented at the MID (Materials Imaging and Dynamics) instrument of the European XFEL and time-resolved NFH is performed using aberration-corrected nano-focusing compound refractive lenses. Specifically, the dynamics of a micro-fluidic water-jet, which is commonly used as sample delivery system at XFELs, is imaged. The jet exhibits rich dynamics of droplet formation in the break-up regime. Moreover, pump–probe imaging is demonstrated using an infrared pulsed laser to induce cavitation and explosion of the jet.},

abstract = {Explosions are spectacular and intriguing phenomena that expose the dynamics of matter under extreme conditions. We investigated, using time-resolved imaging, explosions induced by ultraintense X-ray laser pulses in water drops and jets. Our observations revealed an explosive vaporization followed by high-velocity interacting flows of liquid and vapour, and by the generation of shock trains in the liquid jets. These flows are different from those previously observed in laser ablation, owing to a simpler spatial pattern of X-ray absorption. We show that the explosion dynamics in our experiments is consistent with a redistribution of absorbed energy, mediated by a pressure or shock wave in the liquid, and we model the effects of explosions, including their adverse impact on X-ray laser experiments. X-ray laser explosions have predictable dynamics that may prove useful for controlling the state of pure liquids over broad energy scales and timescales, and for triggering pressure-sensitive molecular dynamics in solutions.},

@article{Liang2022,
abstract = {The dynamics of spherical laser-induced cavitation bubbles in water is investigated by plasma photography, time-resolved shadowgraphs and sensitive single-shot probe beam scattering that portrays the transition from initial nonlinear to late linear oscillations. The frequency of late oscillations yields the bubble's gas content. Numerical simulations with an extended Gilmore model using plasma size as input and oscillation times as fit parameter provide insights into experimentally not accessible bubble parameters and shock wave emission. Model extensions include a term covering the initial shock-driven acceleration of the bubble wall, an automated method determining shock front position and pressure decay and a complete energy balance for the partitioning of absorbed laser energy into vaporization, bubble and shock wave energy and dissipation through viscosity and condensation. These tools are used for analysing a scattering signal covering 102 oscillation cycles from a bubble with 36 m maximum radius produced by a plasma with 1550 K average temperature. Predicted bubble wall velocities during expansion agree well with experimental data. Upon first collapse, most energy was stored in the compressed liquid around the bubble and radiated away acoustically. The collapsed bubble contained more vapour than gas and had a pressure of 13.5 GPa. The decay of the rebound shock wave pressure with radius r was initially, and energy dissipation at the shock front heated the liquid near the bubble wall to temperatures above the superheat limit. The shock-induced temperature rise reduces damping during late bubble oscillations. Damping in first collapse increases significantly for small bubbles with less than 10 m radius.},

The atmospheric backscattering echo of a high-power continuous-wave laser diode is received by a Newtonian telescope and recorded by a tilted imaging sensor satisfying the Scheimpflug condition. The principles as well as the lidar equation are discussed in details. A Scheimpflug lidar system operating at around 808 nm is developed and employed for continuous atmospheric aerosol monitoring at daytime. Localized emission, atmospheric variation, as well as the changes of cloud height are observed from the recorded lidar signals. The extinction coefficient is retrieved according to the slope method for a homogeneous atmosphere.

The microdroplet acted as a lens which focussed the incident light to nanosized regions and directed the emissions from these regions back towards the laser source. This focussing increased the intensity in the focal volume, which resulted in the generation of plasma by multiphoton ionization. Also, the high intensity in the focal volume allowed multiphoton generated free electrons to build critical density during the initial part of the pulse and allowed heating of these electrons during the remaining part of it.},

abstract = {X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) enable obtaining novel insights in structural biology. The recently available MHz repetition rate XFELs allow full data sets to be collected in shorter time and can also decrease sample consumption. However, the microsecond spacing of MHz XFEL pulses raises new challenges, including possible sample damage induced by shock waves that are launched by preceding pulses in the sample-carrying jet. We explored this matter with an X-ray-pump/X-ray-probe experiment employing haemoglobin microcrystals transported via a liquid jet into the XFEL beam. Diffraction data were collected using a shock-wave-free single-pulse scheme as well as the dual-pulse pump-probe scheme. The latter, relative to the former, reveals significant degradation of crystal hit rate, diffraction resolution and data quality. Crystal structures extracted from the two data sets also differ. Since our pump-probe attributes were chosen to emulate EuXFEL operation at its 4.5 MHz maximum pulse rate, this prompts concern about such data collection.},

@article{Taylor1950,
abstract = {This paper was written early in 1941 and circulated to the Civil Defence Research Committee of the Ministry of Home Security in June of that year. The present writer had been told that it might be possible to produce a bomb in which a very large amount of energy would be released by nuclear fission—the name atomic bomb had not then been used—and the work here described represents his first attempt to form an idea of what mechanical effects might be expected if such an explosion could occur. In the then common explosive bomb mechanical effects were produced by the sudden generation of a large amount of gas at a high temperature in a confined space. The practical question which required an answer was: Would similar effects be produced if energy could be released in a highly concentrated form unaccompanied by the generation of gas? This paper has now been declassified, and though it has been superseded by more complete calculations, it seems appropriate to publish it as it was first written, without alteration, except for the omission of a few lines, the addition of this summary, and a comparison with some more recent experimental work, so that the writings of later workers in this field may be appreciated. An ideal problem is here discussed. A finite amount of energy is suddenly released in an infinitely concentrated form. The motion and pressure of the surrounding air is calculated. It is found that a spherical shock wave is propagated outwards whose radius R is related to the time t since the explosion started by the equation R = S ($\gamma$)t t E t $\rho$ 0 -t , where $\rho$ o is the atmospheric density, E is the energy released and S ($\gamma$) a calculated function of of $\gamma$, the ratio of the specific heats of air.},

Although the morphology of flashing sprays has been widely studied, empirical observations of the primary breakup mechanisms at the micro-scale are currently not feasible. Still, further analysis of the micro-scales is necessary for development of closure models in both empirical and numerical models. In this work direct numerical simulations are performed to provide insight into the microscopic processes that dominate the dynamics of the primary atomization. We use a multiphase solver (FS3D) based on the volume of fluid method and PLIC reconstruction to track the liquid-vapour interface with high fidelity, fully resolving viscous and capillary effects. Thermodynamic effects are introduced by calibration of the fluid properties and evaporation rate to a target range of thermodynamic conditions and nuclei number density. The use of an affordable incompressible scheme allows for highly resolved simulations comprising up to thousand bubbles across a range of Weber and Ohnesorge numbers. Using a randomized bubble arrangement it is generally observed that the qualitative characterization of the breakup dynamics corroborates previous results using regular bubble arrays. However, these differ substantially from the simplified mechanics hypothesised in the literature. A temporal analysis of the breakup provides estimates for the rate of change in the spray surface area and volume fraction. The droplet size distributions are compared in terms of droplet number, surface area and volume fraction. A model based on the thermodynamic conditions is proposed to estimate the SMD for different Weber numbers.}

@article{Mur2023,
abstract = {The collapse of microbubbles near a fiber is an example often encountered in water treatment situations and cavitation fibrillation processes. However, due to the broken symmetry conditions, this process has not been studied in detail experimentally or numerically, making it difficult to precisely measure or simulate the rapid bubble evolution during collapse. In this work, we present a novel experimental method, allowing for precisely repeatable cavitation events observation, combined with numerical simulations offering insight into pressure and velocity fields distribution developments in time. Both experimental and numerical works focused on small distances between the bubble and the fiber, where the physical interaction between subjects is the strongest. Four different bubble offsets were considered within the scope of this work, and very good agreement of numerical simulations with experiments was found in all cases. Two modes of bubble collapse were identified, leading to mushroom-shaped bubbles at positions closest to the fiber and a pear-shaped bubble at the farthest position. It is noteworthy that in all four cases, a planar jet formation toward the fiber was observed. The formed jet initially assumes an elongated shape, whereas its stability depends on the mode of bubble collapse. Numerical analysis of the planar jet as the defining feature of the collapse defined lower bounds for the actual values of peak jet velocities, ranging between 250 and 330 m/s, and the resulting impact pressures, which range from 100to 500 MPa.},

The Volume Of Fluid method was employed for tracking liquid and gas phases while compressibility effects were introduced with appropriate equations of state for each phase. Initial conditions of the bubble pressure were estimated through the traditional Rayleigh Plesset equation. The simulated bubble expands in a non-spherically symmetric way due to the interference of the free surface, obtaining an oval shape at the maximum size. During collapse, a jet with mushroom cap is formed at the axis of symmetry with the same direction as the gravity vector, which splits the initial bubble to an agglomeration of toroidal structures. Overall, the simulation results are in agreement with the experimental images, both quantitatively and qualitatively, while pressure waves are predicted both during the expansion and the collapse of the bubble. Minor discrepancies in the jet velocity and collapse rate are found and are attributed to the thermodynamic closure of the gas inside the bubble.},

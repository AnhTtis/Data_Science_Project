In order to enable ChatGPT to generate accurate SQL outputs, we utilized the prompt as shown in Figure \ref{fig:intro}. To ensure a fair demonstration of ChatGPT's Text-to-SQL capabilities,  we directly adopted the Text-to-SQL prompt used in the OpenAI demo webwite\footnote{https://platform.openai.com/examples/default-sql-translate} without conducting further prompt exploration.

The upper half of Figure \ref{fig:intro} represents the prompt in a single-turn Text-to-SQL scenario, where only the database and question information is required in the prompt. Meanwhile, in order to facilitate further evaluations, we emphasize in the prompt that the generated SQL statements can be executed in an SQLite database. The lower half of Figure \ref{fig:intro} represents the prompt in a multi-turn Text-to-SQL scenario, where the prompt for the first interaction is the same as that in the single-turn scenario, and for subsequent interactions, only the new questions are required.

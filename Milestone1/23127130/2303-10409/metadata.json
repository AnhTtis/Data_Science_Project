    "abstract": "The proposed polarized $^3$He$^{++}$ acceleration in RHIC and the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) will require about $2\\times10^{11}$ ions in the source pulse. A new technique had been proposed for production of high intensity polarized $^3$He$^{++}$ ion beams. It is based on ionization and accumulation of the $^3$He gas (polarized by metastability-exchange optical pumping and in the 5 T high magnetic field) in the existing Electron Beam Ion Source (EBIS). A novel $^3$He cryogenic purification and storage technique was developed to provide the required gas purity. An original gas refill and polarized $^3$He gas injection to the EBIS long drift tubes, (which serves as the storage cell) were developed to ensure polarization preservation. An infrared laser system for optical pumping and polarization measurements in the high 3--5 T field has been developed. Neutral atom $^3$He polarizations of 80--85\\% (and sufficiently long $\\sim30$ min relaxation time) have been obtained in the \\lq\\lq{open}\\rq\\rq\\ cell configuration with refilling valve tube inlet. The development of the spin-rotator and $^3$He $^4$He absolute nuclear polarimeter at 6 MeV $^3$He$^{++}$ beam energy is also presented.",

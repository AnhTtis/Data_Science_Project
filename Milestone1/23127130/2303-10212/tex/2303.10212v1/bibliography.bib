abstract={An exciton is the particle-like entity that forms when an electron is bound to a positively charged `hole'. An ordered electronic state in which excitons condense into a single quantum state was proposed as a theoretical possibility many years ago. We review recent studies of semiconductor bilayer systems that provide clear evidence for this phenomenon and explain why exciton condensation in the quantum Hall regime, where these experiments were performed, is as likely to occur in electron--electron bilayers as in electron--hole bilayers. In current quantum Hall excitonic condensates, disorder induces mobile vortices that flow in response to a supercurrent and limit the extremely large bilayer counterflow conductivity.},

abstract = {Superfluidity in fermionic systems occurs through the pairing of fermions into bosons, which can undergo condensation. Depending on the strength of the interactions between fermions, the pairs range from large and overlapping to tightly bound. The crossover between these two limits has been explored in ultracold Fermi gases. Liu et al. observed the crossover in an electronic system consisting of two layers of graphene separated by an insulating barrier and placed in a magnetic field. In this two-dimensional system, the pairs were excitons formed from an electron in one layer and a hole in the other. The researchers used magnetic field and layer separation to tune the interactions and detected the signatures of superfluidity through transport measurements. —JS Excitonic superfluidity is tuned in graphene double layers separated by an insulating barrier. In fermionic systems, superconductivity and superfluidity occur through the condensation of fermion pairs. The nature of this condensate can be tuned by varying the pairing strength, which is challenging in electronic systems. We studied graphene double layers separated by an atomically thin insulator. Under applied magnetic field, electrons and holes couple across the barrier to form bound magneto-excitons whose pairing strength can be continuously tuned by varying the effective layer separation. Using temperature-dependent Coulomb drag and counterflow current measurements, we were able to tune the magneto-exciton condensate through the entire phase diagram from weak to strong coupling. Our results establish magneto-exciton condensates in graphene as a model platform to study the crossover between two bosonic quantum condensate phases in a solid-state system.}}

A self-consistent dielectric description of the random phase approximation (RPA) provides a concise expression for the linear response of the fractional statistics gas to an external electromagnetic field. The RPA, believed to be correct for the present case of long-range interactions, yields two central results that are classic features of superconductivity: (1) a sharp undamped collective mode with a linear dispersion relation at long wavelengths: (2) a gauge-invariant Meissner effect in the transverse response to an external magnetic field. }

abstract = {Eliashberg theory is a theory of superconductivity that describes the role of phonons in providing the attractive interaction between two electrons. Phonon dynamics are taken into account, thus giving rise to retardation effects that impact the electrons, in the form of a frequency-dependent electron self-energy. In the superconducting state, this means that the order parameter, generally considered to be a static quantity in the Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer (BCS) theory, also becomes frequency dependent. Here we review the finite temperature formulation of Eliashberg theory, both on the imaginary and real frequency axis, and briefly display some examples of the consequences of a dynamical, as opposed to static, interaction. Along the way we point out where further work is required, concerning the validity of some of the assumptions used.}

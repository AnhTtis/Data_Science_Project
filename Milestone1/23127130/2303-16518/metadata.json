    "abstract": "The B phase of superfluid 3He can be cooled into the \"pure\" superfluid regime, characterised by negligible thermal quasiparticle density. Here, the bulk superfluid is bounded by a two-dimensional quantum well at the boundaries of the container, where creating quasiparticles requires much less energy. In this Article, we carry out experiments where we create a non-equilibrium state within the quantum well and show that the induced quasiparticle currents flow diffusively in the two-dimensional system. We conclude that the bulk of superfluid 3He is wrapped by an independent two-dimensional superfluid that interacts with mechanical probes instead of the bulk superfluid, only providing access to the bulk superfluid if given a sudden burst of energy. That is, superfluid 3He at the lowest temperatures and applied energies is thermo-mechanically two dimensional. Our work opens this two-dimensional quantum condensate and the interface it forms between the observer and the bulk superfluid for exploration, and provides the possibility of creating two-dimensional condensates of arbitrary topology.",

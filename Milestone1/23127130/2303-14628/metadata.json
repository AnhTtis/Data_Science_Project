    "abstract": "Multi-frame methods improve monocular depth estimation over single-frame approaches by aggregating spatial-temporal information via feature matching. However, the spatial-temporal feature leads to accuracy degradation in dynamic scenes. To enhance the performance, recent methods tend to propose complex architectures for feature matching and dynamic scenes. In this paper, we show that a simple learning framework, together with designed feature augmentation, leads to superior performance. (1) A novel dynamic objects detecting method with geometry explainability is proposed. The detected dynamic objects are excluded during training, which guarantees the static environment assumption and relieves the accuracy degradation problem of the multi-frame depth estimation. (2) Multi-scale feature fusion is proposed for feature matching in the multi-frame depth network, which improves feature matching, especially between frames with large camera motion. (3) The robust knowledge distillation with a robust teacher network and reliability guarantee is proposed, which improves the multi-frame depth estimation without computation complexity increase during the test. The experiments show that our proposed methods achieve great performance improvement on the multi-frame depth estimation.",

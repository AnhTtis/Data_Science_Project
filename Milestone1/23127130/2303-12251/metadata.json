    "abstract": "In this work the possible geodesic completeness of an electromagnetic dipole wormhole is studied in detail. The space-time contains a curvature singularity and belongs to a class of solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell equations with a coupled scalar field. Specifically, a numerical analysis is performed to examine congruences of null geodesics that are directed toward the singularity. The results found here show that, depending on the strength of the coupling between the scalar and electromagnetic fields, the wormhole can be either geodesically incomplete or complete. We then focus on those wormholes that are geodesically complete and study the geometry of the neighborhood of their singularity using Kaluza-Klein theory in a five-dimensional space-time. This process allows us to provide a possible explanation of the completeness of geodesics despite unbounded curvature.",

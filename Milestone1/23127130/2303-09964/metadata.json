    "abstract": "It's known that the union of fibers over elliptic singularities of an almost toric fibered (ATF) symplectic four-manifold gives a symplectic log Calabi-Yau (LCY) divisor. In this note, we show the converse also holds: any symplectic log Calabi-Yau divisor can be realized as the boundary divisor of an almost toric fibration. This realization is canonical once we choose an extra data called the framing on the space of LCY. This is achieved by considering the symplectic analogue of the toric model used in the algebraic geometrical settings.",

    "abstract": "The morphology of retinal blood vessels can indicate various diseases in the human body, and researchers have been working on automatic scanning and segmentation of retinal images to aid diagnosis. This project compares the performance of four neural network architectures in segmenting retinal images, using a combined dataset from different databases, namely the UNet, DR-VNet, UNet-ResNet and UNet-VGG.",

\section{User Study via Online Platform}
\label{sec:userstudy}
\looseness-1We have built an online platform with our \algmultihop~framework using the Blockly Games library~\cite{blocklygames}. The online platform is publicly accessible -- see Footnote~\ref{footnote:webapp}, Section~\ref{sec:intro.contributions}. The platform provides an interface for a participant to practice block-based programming tasks, and receive pop quiz based feedback when stuck. In this section, we report results from an initial user study to assess the efficacy of our scaffolding framework in comparison to other feedback methods.

\looseness-1\textbf{Participation session and feedback methods.} A single  session on our platform comprises of three steps. In \textsc{Step-A}, the participant is presented with a task and has $10$  execution tries to solve it. If a participant fails to solve the task at \textsc{Step-A}, they proceed to \textsc{Step-B} with a randomly assigned feedback method (\algnohint, \algactionhint, and \algmultihop~as discussed below). After \textsc{Step-B}, the participant resumes their attempt on the task in \textsc{Step-C} with $10$ additional execution tries. Note that the feedback method is invoked only once in a single session. Next, we describe different feedback methods at \textsc{Step-B}. \algnohint{} represents a baseline where the participant is directed to \textsc{Step-C} without any  feedback.  \algactionhint{} corresponds to next-step hints as feedback where the participant's code is updated to bring it closer to a solution code~\cite{DBLP:conf/its/RiversK14,DBLP:conf/lats/PiechSHG15,DBLP:journals/aiedu/RiversK17,DBLP:conf/kbse/ZimmermanR15,DBLP:conf/edm/PriceZB17}; we prioritized next-step edits involving programming constructs (e.g., \DSLRepeatUntil) over basic actions (e.g., \DSLMove). \algmultihop~is our pop quiz based feedback.

\looseness-1\textbf{User study results.} We conducted an initial user study with participants recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk; an IRB approval was received before the study. The participants were US-based adults, without expertise in block-based visual programming. Due to the costs involved (over $3$ USD per participant), we selected two tasks for the study:  T-3 and T-5 from Fig.~\ref{fig:experiments.analysis}. We present the detailed results in Fig.~\ref{table:userstudy}. In total, we had $575$ unique participants; out of these, $0.774$ fraction failed to solve the task at \textsc{Step-A} and proceeded to \textsc{Step-B}. \algmultihop{} was assigned to $148$ participants in \textsc{Step-B} ($0.60$ fraction successfully solved the presented pop quiz). Subsequently, $0.128$ fraction of these participants solved the task in \textsc{Step-C}. Here, $0.128$ measures the success rate of participants assigned to \algmultihop{}; in comparison, it is $0.082$ for \algactionhint{}  and $0.046$ for \algnohint{} -- see Fig.~\ref{table:userstudy}.
%%%%%%%%%
%Based on $\chi^2$ significance tests~\cite{mchugh2013chi}, we find that the gap in performance of \algmultihop{} and \algactionhint{} is not significant ($\chi^2 = 1.66$, $p = 0.19$), while \algmultihop{} performs significantly better than \algnohint{} ($\chi^2 = 6.33$, $p < 0.05$). These initial results demonstrate the utility of providing pop quiz based feedback.

Overall, the performance of \algmultihop{} is better than \algactionhint{} (the gap is not significant w.r.t. $\chi^2$-test, $p = 0.19$) and \algnohint{} (the gap is significant w.r.t. $\chi^2$-test, $p = 0.01$)~\cite{mchugh2013chi}. These initial results demonstrate the utility of providing pop quiz based feedback.

\caption{\looseness-1Results for tasks T-3 and T-5 (``Both'' represents aggregated results). In \textbf{\textsc{Step-A}}, we had a total of $575$ ($293$ for T-3, $282$ for T-5) participants; about $0.774$ ($0.642$ for T-3, $0.911$ for T-5) fraction failed to solve the task at \textbf{\textsc{Step-A}} and proceeded to \textbf{\textsc{Step-B}} / \textbf{\textsc{Step-C}} with a randomly assigned feedback method.}

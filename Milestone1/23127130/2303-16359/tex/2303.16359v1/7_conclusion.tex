\looseness-1We proposed a novel scaffolding framework for block-based programming based on pop quizzes that involve inquiry-driven and problem-solving aspects. We developed a modular synthesis algorithm, \algmultihop, that generates these pop quizzes. After conducting an expert assessment using a multi-dimensional rubric, we developed an online platform empowered by our scaffolding framework. While initial user study results with our platform demonstrate the utility of our pop quiz based framework, there are several interesting directions to continue this study, including: (i) extending our platform to provide multiple rounds of feedback within a single participation session and measuring the efficacy of different methods; (ii) comparing our synthesized pop quizzes with those generated by experts; (iii) conducting longitudinal studies with novice students to measure long-term improvements in problem solving skills; (iv) extending our framework to more complex block-based programming domains.

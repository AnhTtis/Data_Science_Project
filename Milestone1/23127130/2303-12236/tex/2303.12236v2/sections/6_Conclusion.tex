We presented~\salad{}, a cascaded 3D diffusion model for part-level implicit representation. Compared with other 3D diffusion models, our model achieves the best quality in shape generation and also is versatile to be exploited in diverse part-level shape manipulation tasks such as completing, mixing, and text-guided editing. Diffusion on the disentangled representation that allows picking individual parts without specifying a bounding region in the 3D space was the key to fully utilizing the zero-shot manipulation capability of the diffusion models. In future work, we plan to further investigate the diffusion models on part-level representations with different primitives and parametrization for parts.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the critical slowing down effects on the critical fluctuations driven by the expanding quark-gluon plasma with a trajectory and expanding rate obtained from hydrodynamics. Within model A, we numerically solved the Langevin dynamics of the non-conserved order parameter field and find that, compared with commonly used Hubble-like expansion, the expansion rate of a realistic hydrodynamic system is pretty large and the associated critical slowing down effects strongly suppress the higher-order cumulants. For an evolving system that approaches the critical point, such critical slowing down suppression overcomes the enhancement of the critical fluctuations, which indicates that the observed maximum fluctuations do not necessarily associate with the evolving trajectory closest to the critical point.",

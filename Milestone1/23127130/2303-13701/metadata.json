    "abstract": "The first author and Oguni introduced a wide class of metric spaces, called coarsely convex spaces. It includes Gromov hyperbolic metric spaces, CAT(0) spaces, systolic complexes, proper injective metric spaces. We introduce the notion of free products of metric spaces and show that free products of symmetric geodesic coarsely convex spaces are also symmetric geodesic coarsely convex spaces. As an application, it follows that free products of symmetric geodesic coarsely convex spaces satisfy the coarse Baum-Connes conjecture.",

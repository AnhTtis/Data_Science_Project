\section{Conclusions}

In this work we presented a novel ensemble algorithm for visual action planning. The method relies on multiple latent space roadmaps-based systems, 
which can be obtained either by different mapping modules or LSR  hyperparameters. Given start and goal observations, a selection of the plans to output is  made  on the basis of action- and node-based similarity measures. We analyzed the performance on two simulation tasks: 
the box stacking task from \cite{lippi2022enabling} and a new grape harvesting task. In both cases, the ensemble model significantly   outperformed the individual models, reaching $99.2\%$ and $92.6\%$ performance in terms of path correctness compared to $96.4\%$ and $74.9\%$ of the best performing individual models, respectively. 
For final validation, we compared the performance of the ensemble algorithm with \cite{lippi2022augment} on a real-world folding task, where the ensemble improved the performance by $8\%$ for a total of  $88\%$ success rate. In future work, we aim to leverage different latent spaces also to facilitate the transfer of knowledge across a range of tasks.

    "abstract": "Malaria is usually diagnosed by a microbiologist by examining a small sample of blood smear. Reducing mortality from malaria infection is possible if it is diagnosed early and followed with appropriate treatment. While the WHO has set audacious goals of reducing malaria incidence and mortality rates by 90% in 2030 and eliminating malaria in 35 countries by that time, it still remains a difficult challenge. Computer-assisted diagnostics are on the rise these days as they can be used effectively as a primary test in the absence of or providing assistance to a physician or pathologist. The purpose of this paper is to describe an approach to detecting, localizing and counting parasitic cells in blood sample images towards easing the burden on healthcare workers.",

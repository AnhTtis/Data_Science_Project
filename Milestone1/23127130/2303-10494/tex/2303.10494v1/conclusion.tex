\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we have proposed \ourtech, the first fully automated approach to incorporate domain-specific knowledge with the insights of the \emph{plastic surgery hypothesis} for boosting the performance of \plm{s} for APR. \ourtech opens up a new dimension for \llm-based \apr by using both fine-tuning and prompting to combine the power of \llm with project-specific information.
Our evaluation results on the popular \dfj 1.2 and 2.0 datasets show that \ourtech is able to achieve the new state-of-the-art results in fixing 89 and 44 bugs (15 and 8 more than the best-performing baselines) respectively.%
%
Different from prior \apr work on plastic surgery hypothesis, \ourtech is fully automated, effective, and general. Moreover, even partial/imprecise information may still effectively guide \llm{s} for \apr!

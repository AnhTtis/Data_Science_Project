    "abstract": "The surface/interface species in perovskite oxides play an essential role in many novel emergent physical phenomena and chemical processes. With low eigen-energy in the terahertz region, such species at buried interfaces remain poorly understood due to the lack of feasible experimental techniques. Here, we show that vibrational resonances and two-dimensional electron gas at the interface can be characterized using surface-specific nonlinear spectroscopy in the terahertz range. This technique uses intra-pulse difference frequency mixing (DFM) process, which is allowed only at surface/interface of a medium with inversion symmetry. Sub-monolayer sensitivity can be achieved using the state-of-the-art detection scheme for the terahertz emission from surface/interface. As a demonstration, Drude-like nonlinear response from the two-dimensional electron gas emerging at LaAlO3/SrTiO3 or Al2O3/ SrTiO3 interface was successfully observed. Meanwhile, the interfacial vibrational spectrum of the ferroelectric soft mode of SrTiO3 at 2.8 THz was also obtained that was polarized by the surface field in the interfacial region. The corresponding surface/interface potential, which is a key parameter for SrTiO3-based interface superconductivity and photocatalysis, can now be determined optically via quantitative analysis on the polarized phonon spectrum. The interfacial species with resonant frequencies in the THz region revealed by our method provide more insights into the understanding of physical properties of complex oxides.",

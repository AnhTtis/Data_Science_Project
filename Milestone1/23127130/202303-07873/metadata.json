    "abstract": "We study a semi-classical model of the mixmaster universe. We first derive\nthe quantum model and then introduce its semi-classical approximation. We\nemploy a general integral quantization method that respects the symmetries of\nthe model given by the affine and the Weyl-Heisenberg groups, and can produce a\nwide class of quantum models. The semi-classical approximation is based on the\ncoherent states. The semi-classical dynamics is complex and can not be solved\nby analytical methods. We focus on a key qualitative feature of the dynamics,\nnamely, we investigate whether the primordial anisotropic universe can undergo\na spontaneous inflationary phase driven by the anisotropic energy combined with\nsemi-classical corrections. The answer to this question provides a useful\nperspective on the inflationary paradigm as well as on alternative bouncing\nmodels.",

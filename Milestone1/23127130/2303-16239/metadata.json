    "abstract": "It contains the proof of a very general $\\partial\\bar\\partial$-lemma, together with a decomposition theorem for currents with values in a (singular) Hermitian line bundle. As a corollary, we establish the Kähler version on an injectivity theorem due to O. Fujino in the projective case.",

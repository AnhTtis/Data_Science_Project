In the SKP, each item is a set of elements, each item has a nonnegative value, and each element has a nonnegative weight. The total weight of a collection of items is given by the total weight of the elements in the union of the items’ sets. This problem has applications to data-base partitioning and to machine loading in flexible manufacturing systems. We show that the SKP remains NP-hard, even in very restricted cases. We present an exact, dynamic programming algorithm for the SKP and show sufficient conditions for it to run in polynomial time.}

The weight of one item is given by the total weight of the elements in the union of the items’ sets. The SUKP accommodates a number of real-life applications and is more complicated and computationally difficult than the 0–1 KP. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid Jaya algorithm with double coding (DHJaya) to solve the SUKP. In the DHJaya, double coding is used to represent the individual, which includes the solutions for solving the SUKP by adopting a mapping function. The Jaya algorithm and differential evolution algorithm are combined to improve the exploration ability. To enhance the exploitation ability, the Cauchy mutation is performed on some individuals. Meanwhile, an improved repairing and optimization algorithm (MS-GROA) is proposed to repair the infeasible solutions and optimize the feasible solutions. We test the DHJaya using three sets of SUKP instances to demonstrate its efficiency, and the obtained results are compared with those in the previous study. Extensive experiments show a remarkable performance of the proposed approach.},

	title = {Longitudinal {Models} for {Project} {Expenditure} {Plans}},
	abstract = {The ability of project managers to generate accurate budget predictions for capital investments is critical for successful project completion and the management of the Australian Department of Defence budget. Accordingly, this paper discusses non-linear regression models to analyse planned time-phasing of expenditures for projects in an Australian Defence capital investment program. Earlier research on time-phasing primarily focuses on the theoretical foundation for applying the cumulative distribution function, usually of functional forms such as Rayleigh and Weibull curves, to model the distribution of project expenditures. Previous approaches have also relied on elementary regression techniques to estimate the parameters of the curves. However, these analyses have generally ignored the longitudinal, repeated measures nature of the data for each project, potentially compromising results because the data within projects is correlated. Here, a non-linear mixed-effects model is used to estimate the parameters of the time-phasing distributions for a large number of major capital investment projects. Unlike ordinary linear or non-linear regression, this has the advantage of accounting for within project correlation and unequal variance. The model can be thought of as a hierarchical model involving both fixed-effects associated with the population of projects and random effects accounting for unexplained inter- and intra-project variability. The fixed part of the model incorporates military domain effects and project epochs, and random effects account for heteroscedasticity and correlations between the repeated measures. Analysis reveals significant differences between project’s time-phasing due to their domain and epoch. The model may be used by project and portfolio planners to estimate required spending plans against project schedule and total planned expenditure; it therefore provides a tool to measure project and financial risk.},

    abstract={Abstract: In this paper, a new method, called best-worst method (BWM) is proposed to solve multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems. In an MCDM problem, a number of alternatives are evaluated with respect to a number of criteria in order to select the best alternative(s). According to BWM, the best (e.g. most desirable, most important) and the worst (e.g. least desirable, least important) criteria are identified first by the decision-maker. Pairwise comparisons are then conducted between each of these two criteria (best and worst) and the other criteria. A maximin problem is then formulated and solved to determine the weights of different criteria. The weights of the alternatives with respect to different criteria are obtained using the same process. The final scores of the alternatives are derived by aggregating the weights from different sets of criteria and alternatives, based on which the best alternative is selected. A consistency ratio is proposed for the BWM to check the reliability of the comparisons. To illustrate the proposed method and evaluate its performance, we used some numerical examples and a real-word decision-making problem (mobile phone selection). For the purpose of comparison, we chose AHP (analytic hierarchy process), which is also a pairwise comparison-based method. Statistical results show that BWM performs significantly better than AHP with respect to the consistency ratio, and the other evaluation criteria: minimum violation, total deviation, and conformity. The salient features of the proposed method, compared to the existing MCDM methods, are: (1) it requires less comparison data; (2) it leads to more consistent comparisons, which means that it produces more reliable results. Keywords: Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM); Multi-attribute decision-making (MADM); Consistency ratio; Pairwise comparison}

This model takes as input annual budgets as well as the cost streams and profit—i.e., net present value (NPV)—of each project. Its output is a portfolio of projects with the highest total NPV, observing yearly budget constraints. We argue that such a portfolio fails to hedge against uncertainties in the budgets, the cost streams, and the profits. As an alternative, we propose a model that forms an optimal priority list of projects, incorporating multiple scenarios for these input parameters. We apply our approach to two sets of example projects from the South Texas Project Nuclear Operating Company.},

	abstract = {A new deterministic algorithm for solving convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problems is presented in this paper: The extended supporting hyperplane (ESH) algorithm uses supporting hyperplanes to generate a tight overestimated polyhedral set of the feasible set defined by linear and nonlinear constraints. A sequence of linear or quadratic integer-relaxed subproblems are first solved to rapidly generate a tight linear relaxation of the original MINLP problem. After an initial overestimated set has been obtained the algorithm solves a sequence of mixed-integer linear programming or mixed-integer quadratic programming subproblems and refines the overestimated set by generating more supporting hyperplanes in each iteration. Compared to the extended cutting plane algorithm ESH generates a tighter overestimated set and unlike outer approximation the generation point for the supporting hyperplanes is found by a simple line search procedure. In this paper it is proven that the ESH algorithm converges to a global optimum for convex MINLP problems. The ESH algorithm is implemented as the supporting hyperplane optimization toolkit (SHOT) solver, and an extensive numerical comparison of its performance against other state-of-the-art MINLP solvers is presented.},

	abstract = {Thirteen years have passed since the seminal book on knapsack problems by Martello and Toth appeared. On this occasion a former colleague exclaimed back in 1990: "How can you write 250 pages on the knapsack problem?" Indeed, the definition of the knapsack problem is easily understood even by a non-expert who will not suspect the presence of challenging research topics in this area at the first glance. However, in the last decade a large number of research publications contributed new results for the knapsack problem in all areas of interest such as exact algorithms, heuristics and approximation schemes. Moreover, the extension of the knapsack problem to higher dimensions both in the number of constraints and in the num­ ber of knapsacks, as well as the modification of the problem structure concerning the available item set and the objective function, leads to a number of interesting variations of practical relevance which were the subject of intensive research during the last few years. Hence, two years ago the idea arose to produce a new monograph covering not only the most recent developments of the standard knapsack problem, but also giving a comprehensive treatment of the whole knapsack family including the siblings such as the subset sum problem and the bounded and unbounded knapsack problem, and also more distant relatives such as multidimensional, multiple, multiple-choice and quadratic knapsack problems in dedicated chapters.},

This Third Edition addresses various new topics and improvements in the field of mathematical programming, and it also presents two software programs, LP Assistant and the Solver add-in for Microsoft Office Excel, for solving linear programming problems. LP Assistant, developed by coauthor Gerard Keough, allows readers to perform the basic steps of the algorithms provided in the book and is freely available via the books related Web site. The use of the sensitivity analysis report and integer programming algorithm from the Solver add-in for Microsoft Office Excel is introduced so readers can solve the books linear and integer programming problems. A detailed appendix contains instructions for the use of both applications. Additional features of the Third Edition include: A discussion of sensitivity analysis for the two-variable problem, along with new examples demonstrating integer programming, non-linear programming, and make vs. buy models Revised proofs and a discussion on the relevance and solution of the dual problem A section on developing an example in Data Envelopment Analysis An outline of the proof of John Nashs theorem on the existence of equilibrium strategy pairs for non-cooperative, non-zero-sum games Providing a complete mathematical development of all presented concepts and examples, Introduction to Linear Programming and Game Theory, Third Edition is an ideal text for linear programming and mathematical modeling courses at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels.

	url = {http://eprint.iacr.org/2020/168},
	abstract = {We present new classical and quantum algorithms for solving random subset-sum instances. First, we improve over the Becker-Coron-Joux algorithm (EUROCRYPT 2011) from \${\textbackslash}widetilde\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}\} {\textbackslash}left(2{\textasciicircum}\{0.291 n\}{\textbackslash}right)\$ downto \${\textbackslash}widetilde\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}\} {\textbackslash}left(2{\textasciicircum}\{0.283 n\}{\textbackslash}right)\$, using more general representations with values in \${\textbackslash}\{-1,0,1,2{\textbackslash}\}\$.



Next, we improve the state of the art of quantum algorithms for this problem in several directions. By combining the Howgrave-Graham-Joux algorithm (EUROCRYPT 2010) and quantum search, we devise an algorithm with asymptotic cost \${\textbackslash}widetilde\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}\} {\textbackslash}left(2{\textasciicircum}\{0.236 n\}{\textbackslash}right)\$, lower than the cost of the quantum walk based on the same classical algorithm proposed by Bernstein, Jeffery, Lange and Meurer (PQCRYPTO 2013). This algorithm has the advantage of using classical memory with quantum random access, while the previously known algorithms used the quantum walk framework, and required quantum memory with quantum random access.

We also propose new quantum walks for subset-sum, performing better than the previous best time complexity of \${\textbackslash}widetilde\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}\} {\textbackslash}left(2{\textasciicircum}\{0.226 n\}{\textbackslash}right)\$ given by Helm and May (TQC 2018). We combine our new techniques to reach a time \${\textbackslash}widetilde\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}\} {\textbackslash}left(2{\textasciicircum}\{0.216 n\}{\textbackslash}right)\$. This time is dependent on a heuristic on quantum walk updates, formalized by Helm and May, that is also required by the previous algorithms. We show how to partially overcome this heuristic, and we obtain an algorithm with quantum time \${\textbackslash}widetilde\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}\} {\textbackslash}left(2{\textasciicircum}\{0.218 n\}{\textbackslash}right)\$ requiring only the standard classical subset-sum heuristics.},

	abstract = {Evolution provides a creative fount of complex and subtle adaptations that often surprise the scientists who discover them. However, the creativity of evolution is not limited to the natural world: Artificial organisms evolving in computational environments have also elicited surprise and wonder from the researchers studying them. The process of evolution is an algorithmic process that transcends the substrate in which it occurs. Indeed, many researchers in the field of digital evolution can provide examples of how their evolving algorithms and organisms have creatively subverted their expectations or intentions, exposed unrecognized bugs in their code, produced unexpectedly adaptations, or engaged in behaviors and outcomes, uncannily convergent with ones found in nature. Such stories routinely reveal surprise and creativity by evolution in these digital worlds, but they rarely fit into the standard scientific narrative. Instead they are often treated as mere obstacles to be overcome, rather than results that warrant study in their own right. Bugs are fixed, experiments are refocused, and one-off surprises are collapsed into a single data point. The stories themselves are traded among researchers through oral tradition, but that mode of information transmission is inefficient and prone to error and outright loss. Moreover, the fact that these stories tend to be shared only among practitioners means that many natural scientists do not realize how interesting and lifelike digital organisms are and how natural their evolution can be. To our knowledge, no collection of such anecdotes has been published before. This article is the crowd-sourced product of researchers in the fields of artificial life and evolutionary computation who have provided first-hand accounts of such cases. It thus serves as a written, fact-checked collection of scientifically important and even entertaining stories. In doing so we also present here substantial evidence that the existence and importance of evolutionary surprises extends beyond the natural world, and may indeed be a universal property of all complex evolving systems.},

	abstract = {Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is among the most universally applied population-based metaheuristic optimization algorithms. PSO has been successfully used in various scientific fields, ranging from humanities, engineering, chemistry, medicine, to advanced physics. Since its introduction in 1995, the method has been widely investigated, which led to the development of hundreds of PSO versions and numerous theoretical and empirical findings on their convergence and parameterization. However, so far there is no detailed study on the proper choice of PSO swarm size, although it is widely known that population size crucially affects the performance of metaheuristics. In most applications, authors follow the initial suggestion from 1995 and restrict the population size to 20–50 particles. In this study, we relate the performance of eight PSO variants to swarm sizes that range from 3 up to 1000 particles. Tests are performed on sixty 10- to 100-dimensional scalable benchmarks and twenty-two 1- to 216-dimensional real-world problems. Although results do differ for the specific PSO variants, for the majority of considered PSO algorithms the best performance is obtained with swarms composed of 70–500 particles, indicating that the classical choice is often too small. Larger swarms frequently improve efficiency of the method for more difficult problems and practical applications. For unimodal problems slightly lower swarm sizes are recommended for the majority of PSO variants, but some would still perform best with hundreds of particles.},

QKP has been studied intensively due to its simple structure yet challenging difficulty and numerous applications. Quantum Inspired Evolutionary Algorithm (QIEA) belongs to the class of Evolutionary Algorithms and exhibits behaviour of an Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA). QIEA provides a generic framework that has to be carefully tailored for a given problem to obtain an effective implementation. Thus, several forms of QIEA exist in the literature. These have been successfully applied on many hard problems. A new QIEA, QIEA-PSA is proposed with improved exploration and exploitation capabilities. Computational experiments on these benchmarks show that QIEA-PSA is improved significantly both in terms of the quality of solutions and speed of convergence on several benchmark QKP instances. The ideas incorporated are general enough and can be utilized with advantage on other similar and not so similar problems.},

We first introduce a general framework which allows for sequential updates of variational parameters to improve probe states and measurements and is widely applicable to both discrete and continuous-variable settings. We then demonstrate the practical functioning of the approach through numerical simulations, showcasing how tailored probes and measurements improve over standard methods in the noisy regime. Along the way, we prove the validity of a general parameter-shift rule for noisy evolutions, expected to be of general interest in variational quantum algorithms. In our approach, we advocate the mindset of quantum-aided design, exploiting quantum technology to learn close to optimal, experimentally feasible quantum metrology protocols.},

A common practice to tackle problems characterized by uncertainties, is the re-evaluation of the objective function at every point of interest for a fixed number of replications.

However, this approach can prove inefficient, allocating replications to unpromising candidate solutions. We propose a hybrid approach that integrates the established Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm with the Reinforcement Learning approach to efficiently tackle noisy problems by intelligently allocating the available computational budget. Two variants of the proposed approach, based on different selection schemes, are assessed and compared against the typical alternative of equal sampling. The results are reported and analyzed, offering significant evidence regarding the potential of the proposed approach.},

Circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) provides a promising hardware platform for implementing robust quantum devices. In particular, bosonic encodings in cQED that use multi-photon states of superconducting cavities to encode information have shown success in realizing hardware-efficient QEC.

In its original form, the algorithm applies two different Hamiltonians, called the mixer and the cost Hamiltonian, in alternation with the goal being to approach the ground state of the cost Hamiltonian. Recently, it has been suggested that one might use such a set-up as a parametric quantum circuit with possibly some other goal than reaching ground states. From this perspective, a recent work [S. Lloyd, arXiv:1812.11075] argued that for one-dimensional local cost Hamiltonians, composed of nearest neighbor ZZ terms, this set-up is quantum computationally universal, i.e., all unitaries can be reached up to arbitrary precision. In the present paper, we give the complete proof of this statement and the precise conditions under which such a one-dimensional QAOA might be considered universal. We further generalize this type of universality for certain cost Hamiltonians with ZZ and ZZZ terms arranged according to the adjacency structure of certain graphs and hypergraphs.},

	abstract = {Current quantum computing devices have different strengths and weaknesses depending on their architectures. This means that flexible approaches to circuit design are necessary. We address this task by introducing a novel space-efficient quantum optimization algorithm for the graph coloring problem. Our circuits are deeper than the ones of the standard approach. However, the number of required qubits is exponentially reduced in the number of colors. We present extensive numerical simulations demonstrating the performance of our approach. Furthermore, to explore currently available alternatives, we perform a study of random graph coloring on a quantum annealer to test the limiting factors of that approach, too.},

	abstract = {In the era of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers it is crucial to design quantum algorithms which do not require many qubits or deep circuits. Unfortunately, the most well-known quantum algorithms are too demanding to be run on currently available quantum devices. Moreover, even the state-of-the-art algorithms developed for the NISQ era often suffer from high space complexity requirements for particular problem classes. In this paper, we show that it is possible to greatly reduce the number of qubits needed for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), a paradigmatic optimization task, at the cost of having deeper variational circuits. While the focus is on this particular problem, we claim that the approach can be generalized for other problems where the standard bit-encoding is highly inefficient. Finally, we also propose encoding schemes which smoothly interpolate between the qubit-efficient and the circuit depth-efficient models. All the proposed encodings remain efficient to implement within the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm framework.},

For quantum systems, where the physical dimension grows exponentially, finding the eigenvalues of certain operators is one such intractable problem and remains a fundamental challenge. The quantum phase estimation algorithm efficiently finds the eigenvalue of a given eigenvector but requires fully coherent evolution. Here we present an alternative approach that greatly reduces the requirements for coherent evolution and combine this method with a new approach to state preparation based on ansätze and classical optimization. We implement the algorithm by combining a highly reconfigurable photonic quantum processor with a conventional computer. We experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of this approach with an example from quantum chemistry—calculating the ground-state molecular energy for He–H+. The proposed approach drastically reduces the coherence time requirements, enhancing the potential of quantum resources available today and in the near future.},

	abstract = {Strongly coupled at distance
The development of hybrid quantum systems provides a flexibility that allows for various components to be coupled together, thereby expanding the opportunity to build quantum sensors and devices that can be designed for specific purposes. Key to doing so is being able to strongly couple the different components. Most developments to date have relied on the components being in close proximity, which can hamper design flexibility. Karg et al. used a laser to induce strong coupling between a cloud of atoms and an optomechanical membrane. With the components separated by 1 meter, this approach demonstrates a methodology of coupling quantum systems and easing up restrictions on spatial proximity.
Science, this issue p. 174
Engineering strong interactions between quantum systems is essential for many phenomena of quantum physics and technology. Typically, strong coupling relies on short-range forces or on placing the systems in high-quality electromagnetic resonators, which restricts the range of the coupling to small distances. We used a free-space laser beam to strongly couple a collective atomic spin and a micromechanical membrane over a distance of 1 meter in a room-temperature environment. The coupling is highly tunable and allows the observation of normal-mode splitting, coherent energy exchange oscillations, two-mode thermal noise squeezing, and dissipative coupling. Our approach to engineering coherent long-distance interactions with light makes it possible to couple very different systems in a modular way, opening up a range of opportunities for quantum control and coherent feedback networks.
Laser light is used to strongly couple different quantum systems that are more than 1 meter apart.

The algorithm depends on a positive integer p and the quality of the approximation improves as p is increased. The quantum circuit that implements the algorithm consists of unitary gates whose locality is at most the locality of the objective function whose optimum is sought. The depth of the circuit grows linearly with p times (at worst) the number of constraints. If p is fixed, that is, independent of the input size, the algorithm makes use of efficient classical preprocessing. If p grows with the input size a different strategy is proposed. We study the algorithm as applied to MaxCut on regular graphs and analyze its performance on 2-regular and 3-regular graphs for fixed p. For p = 1, on 3-regular graphs the quantum algorithm always finds a cut that is at least 0.6924 times the size of the optimal cut.},

However, instead of binary, numeric, or symbolic representation, QEA uses a Q-bit, defined as the smallest unit of information, for the probabilistic representation and a Q-bit individual as a string of Q-bits. A Q-gate is introduced as a variation operator to drive the individuals toward better solutions. To demonstrate its effectiveness and applicability, experiments were carried out on the knapsack problem, which is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem. The results show that QEA performs well, even with a small population, without premature convergence as compared to the conventional genetic algorithm.},

This thesis extends that work in several ways. First, it derives a lower bound on information advantage that Alice enjoys over Eve in the passive eavesdropping scenario. Next, it explores the performance of alternative practical receivers for Alice, as well as various high-order modulation formats for the passive eavesdropping case. Finally, this thesis extends previous analysis to consider how Alice and Bob can minimize their vulnerability to Eve's doing active eavesdropping, i.e., when she injects her own light into the channel.},

	abstract = {Machine learning can help us in solving problems in the context of big-data analysis and classification, as well as in playing complex games such as Go. But can it also be used to find novel protocols and algorithms for applications such as large-scale quantum communication? Here we show that machine learning can be used to identify central quantum protocols, including teleportation, entanglement purification, and the quantum repeater. These schemes are of importance in long-distance quantum communication, and their discovery has shaped the field of quantum information processing. However, the usefulness of learning agents goes beyond the mere reproduction of known protocols; the same approach allows one to find improved solutions to long-distance communication problems, in particular when dealing with asymmetric situations where the channel noise and segment distance are nonuniform. Our findings are based on the use of projective simulation, a model of a learning agent that combines reinforcement learning and decision making in a physically motivated framework. The learning agent is provided with a universal gate set, and the desired task is specified via a reward scheme. From a technical perspective, the learning agent has to deal with stochastic environments and reactions. We utilize an idea reminiscent of hierarchical skill acquisition, where solutions to subproblems are learned and reused in the overall scheme. This is of particular importance in the development of long-distance communication schemes, and opens the way to using machine learning in the design and implementation of quantum networks.},

This method works on the effect of influence of a teacher on learners. Like other nature-inspired algorithms, TLBO is also a population-based method and uses a population of solutions to proceed to the global solution. The population is considered as a group of learners or a class of learners. The process of TLBO is divided into two parts: the first part consists of the ‘Teacher Phase’ and the second part consists of the ‘Learner Phase’. ‘Teacher Phase’ means learning from the teacher and ‘Learner Phase’ means learning by the interaction between learners. The basic philosophy of the TLBO method is explained in detail. To check the effectiveness of the method it is tested on five different constrained benchmark test functions with different characteristics, four different benchmark mechanical design problems and six mechanical design optimization problems which have real world applications. The effectiveness of the TLBO method is compared with the other population-based optimization algorithms based on the best solution, average solution, convergence rate and computational effort. Results show that TLBO is more effective and efficient than the other optimization methods for the mechanical design optimization problems considered. This novel optimization method can be easily extended to other engineering design optimization problems.},

	abstract = {Teaching-learning-based optimization (TLBO) is a recently proposed meta-heuristic optimization method and demonstrates outstanding performance for solving numerous sciences and engineering problems. However, many studies have shown that TLBO has a strong bias towards converging to origin and poorly performs in the problems with shifted solutions. To conquer this problem, a novel self-adaptive hybrid self-learning based TLBO (SHSLTLBO) is proposed in this paper. By constructing a self-adaptive framework, the original TLBO is fused with the Gaussian distribution, and the novel updating law switches in two modes corresponding to the ﬁtness during the searching process. Additionally, in order to avoid local convergence in the initialization, a self-learning phase is introduced, associated to the original teaching and learning phase. The performance of the proposed SHSLTLBO is tested in the numerical benchmark functions, where the comprehensive comparison carries out with the state-of-the-art TLBO variants and other meta-heuristic approaches. The results demonstrate superior advantages of the proposed algorithm at balancing along the evolutionary stages among the TLBO variants. In the experiments, the two well-performed meta-heuristic optimization methods, namely LSHADE and HCLPSO, are used as the comparative methods to SHSLTLBO, where their superior performances of them are shown on the shifted problems. With increasing dimensionality, the performance of TLBO goes down rapidly while LSHADE’s relative ranking improves. Apart from these scenarios, the comparative results of diﬀerent dimensional problems indicate that the proposed SHSLTLBO has the best convergence and stability in solving all 28 benchmarks with low dimension and shifted solutions.},

	abstract = {The Urban Transit Routing Problem (UTRP) comprises an NP-hard problem that deals with the construction of route networks for public transit networks. It is a highly complex and multiply constrained problem, in which the assessment of candidate route networks can be both time consuming and challenging. Except for that, a multitude of potential solutions are usually rejected due to infeasibility. Because of this difficulty, soft computing algorithms can be very effective for its efficient solution. The success of these methods, however, depends mainly on the quality of the representation of candidate solutions, on the efficiency of the initialization procedure and on the suitability of the modification operators used. An optimization algorithm, based on particle swarm optimization, is designed and presented in the current contribution, aiming at the efficient solution of UTRP. Apart from the development of the optimization algorithm, emphasis is also given on appropriate representation of candidate solutions, the route networks in other words, and the respective evaluation procedure. The latter procedure considers not only the quality of service offered to each passenger, but also the costs of the operator. Results are compared on the basis of Mandl's benchmark problem of a Swiss bus network, which is probably the only widely investigated and accepted benchmark problem in the relevant literature. Comparison of the obtained results with other results published in the literature shows that the performance of the proposed soft computing algorithm is quite competitive compared to existing techniques.},

Two objective functions are considered which are minimizing sum of the travel time and waiting and minimizing maximum of ideal time pertinent to each facility, respectively. Second objective causes to obtain the best combination of the facilities which are more equilibrium for the proposed model solutions.

On one hand, we provided advances with PSO, including its modifications (including quantum-behaved PSO, bare-bones PSO, chaotic PSO, and fuzzy PSO), population topology (as fully connected, von Neumann, ring, star, random, etc.), hybridization (with genetic algorithm, simulated annealing, Tabu search, artificial immune system, ant colony algorithm, artificial bee colony, differential evolution, harmonic search, and biogeography-based optimization), extensions (to multiobjective, constrained, discrete, and binary optimization), theoretical analysis (parameter selection and tuning, and convergence analysis), and parallel implementation (in multicore, multiprocessor, GPU, and cloud computing forms). On the other hand, we offered a survey on applications of PSO to the following eight fields: electrical and electronic engineering, automation control systems, communication theory, operations research, mechanical engineering, fuel and energy, medicine, chemistry, and biology. It is hoped that this survey would be beneficial for the researchers studying PSO algorithms.},

A numeric optimization framework is introduced targeting maximally- and partially-entangling operations on ion pairs, multi-ion registers, multi-ion subsets of large registers, and parallel operations within a single register. Ions are assumed to be individually addressed, permitting optimization over amplitude- and phase-modulated controls. Calculations and simulations demonstrate that the inclusion of modulation of the difference phase for the bichromatic drive used in the Mølmer–Sørensen gate permits approximately time-optimal control across a range of gate configurations, and when suitably combined with analytic constraints can also provide robustness against key experimental sources of error. The impact of experimental constraints such as bounds on coupling rates or modulation band-limits on achievable performance is further demonstrated. Using a custom optimization engine based on TensorFlow, for optimizations on ion registers up to 20 ions, time-to-solution of order tens of minutes using a local-instance laptop is also demonstrated, allowing computational access to system-scales relevant to near-term trapped-ion devices.},

	abstract = {The posterior probability density function (PPD), σ(m{\textbar}dobs), of earth model m, where dobs are the measured data, describes the solution of a geophysical inverse problem, when a Bayesian inference model is used to describe the problem. In many applications, the PPD is neither analytically tractable nor easily approximated and simple analytic expressions for the mean and variance of the PPD are not available. Since the complete description of the PPD is impossible in the highly multi-dimensional model space of many geophysical applications, several measures such as the highest posterior density regions, marginal PPD and several orders of moments are often used to describe the solutions. Calculation of such quantities requires evaluation of multidimensional integrals. A faster alternative to enumeration and blind Monte-Carlo integration is importance sampling which may be useful in several applications. Thus how to draw samples of m from the PPD becomes an important aspect of geophysical inversion such that importance sampling can be used in the evaluation of these multi-dimensional integrals. Importance sampling can be carried out most efficiently by a Gibbs' sampler (GS). We also introduce a method which we called parallel Gibbs' sampler (PGS) based on genetic algorithms (GA) and show numerically that the results from the two samplers are nearly identical. We first investigate the performance of enumeration and several sampling based techniques such as a GS, PGS and several multiple maximum a posteriori (MAP) algorithms for a simple geophysical problem of inversion of resistivity sounding data. Several non-linear optimization methods based on simulated annealing (SA), GA and some of their variants can be devised which can be made to reach very close to the maximum of the PPD. Such MAP estimation algorithms also sample different points in the model space. By repeating these MAP inversions several times, it is possible to sample adequately the most significant portion(s) of the PPD and all these models can be used to construct the marginal PPD, mean) covariance, etc. We observe that the GS and PGS results are identical and indistinguishable from the enumeration scheme. Multiple MAP algorithms slightly underestimate the posterior variances although the correlation values obtained by all the methods agree very well. Multiple MAP estimation required 0.3\% of the computational effort of enumeration and 40\% of the effort of a GS or PGS for this problem. Next, we apply GS to the inversion of a marine seismic data set to quantify uncertainties in the derived model, given the prior distribution determined from several common midpoint gathers.},

	abstract = {Estimating the impact of environmental processes on vertical reef development in geological time is a very challenging task. pyReef-Core is a deterministic carbonate stratigraphic forward model designed to simulate the key biological and environmental processes that determine vertical reef accretion and assemblage changes in fossil reef drill cores. We present a Bayesian framework called Bayesreef for the estimation and uncertainty quantification of parameters in pyReef-Core that represent environmental conditions affecting the growth of coral assemblages in geological timescales. Weencounter multimodal posterior distributions and investigate the challenges of sampling using Markov chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) methods, which includes parallel tempering MCMC. We use a synthetic reef-core to investigate fundamental issues and then apply the methodology to a selected reef-core from the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. The results show that Bayesreef accurately estimates and provides uncertainty quantification of the selected parameters that represent environment and ecological conditions in pyReef-Core. Bayesreef provides insights into the complex posterior distributions of the parameters in pyReef-Core, which provides the groundwork for future research in this area.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} The rigorous quantification of uncertainty in geophysical inversions is a challenging problem. Inversions are often ill-posed and the likelihood surface may be multi-modal; properties of any single mode become inadequate uncertainty measures, and sampling methods become inefficient for irregular posteriors or high-dimensional parameter spaces. We explore the influences of different choices made by the practitioner on the efficiency and accuracy of Bayesian geophysical inversion methods that rely on Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling to assess uncertainty using a multi-sensor inversion of the three-dimensional structure and composition of a region in the Cooper Basin of South Australia as a case study. The inversion is performed using an updated version of the Obsidian distributed inversion software. We find that the posterior for this inversion has a complex local covariance structure, hindering the efficiency of adaptive sampling methods that adjust the proposal based on the chain history. Within the context of a parallel-tempered Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme for exploring high-dimensional multi-modal posteriors, a preconditioned Crank–Nicolson proposal outperforms more conventional forms of random walk. Aspects of the problem setup, such as priors on petrophysics and on 3-D geological structure, affect the shape and separation of posterior modes, influencing sampling performance as well as the inversion results. The use of uninformative priors on sensor noise enables optimal weighting among multiple sensors even if noise levels are uncertain.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Using two-photon Bragg spectroscopy, we measure excitation spectra at a momentum of approximately half the Fermi momentum, both above and below the superfluid critical temperature Tc. Below Tc, the dominant excitation is the Bogoliubov-Anderson (BA) phonon mode, driven by gradients in the phase of the superfluid order parameter. The temperature dependence of the BA phonon is consistent with a theoretical model based on the quasiparticle random phase approximation in which the dominant damping mechanism is via collisions with thermally excited quasiparticles. As the temperature is increased above Tc, the phonon evolves into a strongly damped collisional mode, accompanied by an abrupt increase in spectral width. Our study reveals strong similarities between sound propagation in the unitary Fermi gas and bosonic liquid helium.},

	abstract = {We advance a mathematical representation of Command and Control as distributed decision makers using the Kuramoto model of networked phase oscillators. The phase represents a continuous Perception-Action cycle of agents at each network node; the network the formal and informal communications of human agents and information artefacts; coupling the strength of relationship between agents; native frequencies the individual decision speeds of agents when isolated; and stochasticity temporal noisiness in intrinsic agent behaviour. Skewed heavy-tailed noise captures that agents may randomly ‘jump’ forward (rather than backwards) in their decision state under time stress; there is considerable evidence from organisational science that experienced decision-makers behave in this way in critical situations. We present a use-case for the model using data for military headquarters staff tasked to drive a twenty-four hour ‘battle-rhythm’. This serves to illustrate how such a mathematical model may be used realistically. We draw on a previous case-study where headquarters’ networks were mapped for routine business and crisis scenarios to provide advice to a military sponsor. We tune the model using the first data set to match observations that staff performed synchronously under such conditions. Testing the impact of the crisis scenario using the corresponding network and heavy-tailed stochasticity, we find increased probability of decision incoherence due to the high information demand of some agents in this case. This demonstrates the utility of the model to identify risks in headquarters design, and potential means of identifying points to change. We compare to qualitative organisational theories to initially validate the model.},

	abstract = {In the last 5 years there has been renewed interest in the health benefits of vitamin D. A central feature of this revival has been new information concerning the nonclassical effects of vitamin D. In particular, studies of the interaction between vitamin D and the immune system have highlighted the importance of localized conversion of precursor 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) to active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) as a mechanism for maintaining antibacterial activity in humans. The clinical relevance of this has been endorsed by increasing evidence of suboptimal 25OHD status in populations across the globe. Collectively these observations support the hypothesis that vitamin D insufficiency may lead to dysregulation of human immune responses and may therefore be an underlying cause of infectious disease and immune disorders. The current review describes the key mechanisms associated with vitamin D metabolism and signaling for both innate immune (antimicrobial activity and antigen presentation) and adaptive immune (T and B lymphocyte function) responses. These include coordinated actions of the vitamin D-activating enzyme, 1α-hydroxylase (CYP27B1), and the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in mediating intracrine and paracrine actions of vitamin D. Finally, the review will consider the role of immunomodulatory vitamin D in human health, with specific emphasis on infectious and autoimmune disease.},

These states include superfluids, superconductors, and a subclass of antiferromagnets and charge density waves. The collective fluctuations in the ordered state may then be categorized as oscillations of phase and amplitude of Ψ(r, t). The phase oscillations are the Goldstone modes of the broken continuous symmetry. The amplitude modes, even at long wavelengths, are well defined and are decoupled from the phase oscillations only near particle-hole symmetry, where the equations of motion have an effective Lorentz symmetry, as in particle physics and if there are no significant avenues for decay into other excitations. They bear close correspondence with the so-called Higgs modes in particle physics, whose prediction and discovery are very important for the standard model of particle physics. In this review, we discuss the theory and the possible observation of the amplitude or Higgs modes in condensed matter physics—in superconductors, cold atoms in periodic lattices, and uniaxial antiferromagnets. We discuss the necessity for at least approximate particle-hole symmetry as well as the special conditions required to couple to such modes because, being scalars, they do not couple linearly to the usual condensed matter probes.},

	abstract = {We study the interactions among phonons and the phonon lifetime in a pair-condensed Fermi gas in the BEC-BCS crossover in the collisionless regime. To compute the phonon-phonon coupling amplitudes we use a microscopic model based on a generalized BCS Ansatz including moving pairs, which allows for a systematic expansion around the mean field BCS approximation of the ground state. We show that the quantum hydrodynamic expression of the amplitudes obtained by Landau and Khalatnikov apply only on the energy shell, that is for resonant processes that conserve energy. The microscopic model yields the same excitation spectrum as the Random Phase Approximation, with a linear (phononic) start and a concavity at low wave number that changes from upwards to downwards in the BEC-BCS crossover. When the concavity of the dispersion relation is upwards at low wave number, the leading damping mechanism at low temperature is the Beliaev-Landau process 2 phonons ↔ 1 phonon while, when the concavity is downwards, it is the Landau-Khalatnikov process 2 phonons ↔ 2 phonons. In both cases, by rescaling the wave vectors to absorb the dependence on the interaction strength, we obtain a universal formula for the damping rate. This universal formula corrects and extends the original analytic results of Landau and Khalatnikov [ZhETF 19, 637 (1949)] for the 2↔2 processes in the downward concavity case. In the upward concavity case, for the Beliaev 1↔ 2 process for the unitary gas at zero temperature, we calculate the damping rate of an excitation with wave number q including the first correction proportional to q7 to the q5 hydrodynamic prediction, which was never done before in a systematic way.},

By using two-fluid hydrodynamic theory, we review the density response χ nn ( q , ω) of these systems as a tool to identify second sound in experiments based on density probes. Our work generalizes the well-known studies of the dynamic structure factor S ( q , ω) in superfluid 4 He in the critical region. We show that, in the unitary limit of uniform superfluid Fermi gases, the relative weight of second versus first sound in the compressibility sum rule is given by the Landau–Placzek ratio \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/1367-2630/12/4/043040/nj343298ieqn1.gif] {\textbackslash}epsilon\_{\textbackslash}mathrmLP{\textbackslash}equiv ({\textbackslash}barc\_p-{\textbackslash}barc\_v)/{\textbackslash}barc\_v for all temperatures below T c . In contrast to superfluid 4 He, \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/epsi.gif] epsilon LP is much larger in strongly interacting Fermi gases, being already of order unity for T 0.8 T c , thereby providing promising opportunities to excite second sound with density probes. The relative weights of first and second sound are quite different in S ( q , ω) (measured in pulse propagation studies) as compared with Imχ nn ( q , ω) (measured in two-photon Bragg scattering). We show that first and second sound in S ( q , ω) in a strongly interacting Bose-condensed gas are similar to those in a Fermi gas at unitarity. However, in a weakly interacting Bose gas, first and second sound are mainly uncoupled oscillations of the thermal cloud and condensate, respectively, and second sound has most of the spectral weight in S ( q , ω). We also discuss the behaviour of the superfluid and normal fluid velocity fields involved in first and second sound.},

Both these techniques have good performance to solve optimization problems. PSEQEA combines the PSO with QEA to improve the performance of QEA and it can solve single objective optimization problem efficiently and effectively. In this paper, PSEQEA is studied to solve multiobjective Optimization (MO) problems. Some wellknown non-trivial functions are used to observe the performance of PSEQEA to detect the Pareto optimal points and the shape of the Pareto front using both Fixed Weighted Aggregation method and Adaptive Weighted Aggregation method. Moreover, Vector Evaluated PSEQEA (VEPSEQEA) borrows concept from Schaffer’s Vector Evaluated Genetic Algorithm (VEGA) that can also cope with MO problems. Simulation results show that PSEQEA and VEPSEQEA perform better than PSO and VEPSO to discover the Pareto frontier.},

The primary objective of this task is to select a set of projects, within a ﬁxed planning window and subject to budgetary constraints, that will lead to improved capabilities. While inherently related to the well-known multi-period knapsack problem, addressing this problem in the context of the defence sector gives rise to a number of unique nuances and associated challenges. Furthermore, the literature pertaining to the selection and scheduling of projects for capability-based planning in the defence sector is rather limited. To address this literature gap, this paper formalizes a multi-period project selection and scheduling problem inspired by future force design. Numerous heuristics, both random and deterministic, along with a hybrid genetic algorithm, are employed to optimize a set of instances of the proposed problem formulation with various characteristics derived from real-world, public defence data made available by the Australian Department of Defence.},

	abstract = {Portfolio selection problem is a model where the decision maker chooses options or projects with given costs subject to budgetary constraints. When the options depend on each other, the synergies and redundancies need to be taken into account. In this project we consider the theory of capacities and discrete fuzzy integrals as alternatives to the quadratic knapsack problem, and will quantify the dependencies by using recently established nonadditivity and nonmodularity indices. The outcomes are theoretical models and optimisation tools for solving knapsack problems with dependencies. In the first part of this report (Chapter 1) an initial analysis and literature review are presented. The analysis looks at different ways to model interactions between items
in a portfolio. From quadratic knapsack we move to cooperative games theory as a tool to value the dependencies, and to special types of capacities in order to prevent problem size explosion. The second part (Chapter 2) discusses various formulations of the knapsack problem with dependencies, with the emphasis on standardisation, efficiency and potential scalability. Specifically attempts are made to translate the knapsack problem into a standardconvex mixed integer linear programming problem (MIP), which is well studied, with various efficient algorithms and software available.},

Further, we explore the potential for the Internet to dissipate traditional cleavages in participation that tend to mirror the inequalities in the availability and use of technology. The findings suggest that while many of the “have-nots” do engage in online networking at higher rates than their counterparts, they are less likely to be exposed to political exchanges within their networks.

Applying C2 within the DL environment requires development of methodologies to provide definition and structure for existing operational concepts while providing conceptual growth space for new operational techniques. We develop a systems architecture approach that defines C2 models for decentralized and distributed command structures and proposes criteria for assessing functionality and impacts to the C2 of naval platforms during DL operations. C2 modelling for DL documents the inter-connections and relationship of information flow and the system requirements for maintaining the interconnection links during a simulated operational deployment of an Adaptive Force Package (AFP). This structure provides for an architecture view of the functions and metrics that provide criteria for decision making during the operational planning of a DL mission. Development of an initial architecture enables future modelling and architecture refinement through simulations of the C2 structure and further research into technologies and methods of effective communication systems.},

Here we distinguish the ability of such a system to self-synchronise from the stability of this behaviour. While self-synchronisation is a consequence of genuine non-perturbative dynamics, the stability in dynamical systems is usually accessible by fluctuations about a fixed point, here taken to be the synchronised solution. We examine this problem in terms of modes of the graph Laplacian, by which the absolute Lyapunov stability of the synchronised fixed point is readily demonstrated. Departures from stability are seen to arise at the next order in fluctuations where the dynamical equations resemble those for species population models, the logistic and Lotka-Volterra equations. Methods from these systems are exploited to analytically derive new critical couplings signalling deviation from classical stability. We observe in some cases an intermediate regime of behaviour, between incoherence and synchronisation, where system wide periodic behaviours are exhibited. We discuss these results in light of simulations.},

There are two main types of PSO, which are continuous PSO (CPSO) and binary PSO (BPSO). Since PSO is originally proposed to address continuous problems, CPSO has been studied extensively while there are only a few studies about BPSO. In a standard PSO algorithm, momentum is an important component, which preserves the swarm’s diversity. However, since movements in binary search spaces and continuous search spaces are different, it is not appropriate to apply directly the momentum concept of CPSO to BPSO. This paper introduces a new momentum concept to BPSO, which leads to a novel BPSO algorithm, named SBPSO. SBPSO is compared with a recent BPSO algorithm, named PBPSO, in two well-known binary problems: knapsack and feature selection. The experimental results on knapsack datasets show that SBPSO can find better solutions than PBPSO. In feature selection problems, SBPSO can select a smaller number of features and still achieve similar or better accuracies than PBPSO and using all the original features in a comparative computation time.},

By the fact that the presented code is based on an hard 0-1 optimization method that handles the integer part of the optimization in a simple fashion and in sub-polynomial time, it has been possible to not only reduce the number of lines to 51 without sacrificing any readability, but also to obtain void-solid designs with close to none checkerboard patterns with improved efficiency. The numerical results in the paper show that the proposed method has the best average times compared to several codes available in literature. We also present extensions to different boundary conditions and to three dimensional designs. The code can be used by students and the newcomers in topology optimization because of its simplicity and readability.

Therefore, this study specifically investigated the performance of various implementations of the SA algorithm when applied to binary functions. Results obtained in this investigation demonstrated that 1) the SA algorithm can reliably minimize difficult binary functions, 2) a simple technique, analogous to the local search technique used in minimizing continuous functions, can exploit the special structure of binary problems and significantly improve the solution with negligible computational cost, and 3) this technique effectively reduces computational cost while maintaining reconstruction fidelity in binary tomography problems.

The simplicity and inexpensive computational cost makes this algorithm very popular and powerful in solving a wide range of problems. The binary version of this algorithm has been introduced for solving binary problems. The main part of the binary version is a transfer function which is responsible to map a continuous search space to a discrete search space. Currently there appears to be insufficient focus on the transfer function in the literature despite its apparent importance. In this study six new transfer functions divided into two families, s-shaped and v-shaped, are introduced and evaluated. Twenty-five benchmark optimization functions provided by CEC 2005 special session are employed to evaluate these transfer functions and select the best one in terms of avoiding local minima and convergence speed. In order to validate the performance of the best transfer function, a comparative study with six recent modifications of BPSO is provided as well. The results prove that the new introduced v-shaped family of transfer functions significantly improves the performance of the original binary PSO.},

It contains elegant combinatorial theory, useful and interesting algorithms, and deep results about the intrinsic complexity of combinatorial problems. Its clarity of exposition and excellent selection of exercises will make it accessible and appealing to all those with a taste for mathematics and algorithms. Richard Karp,University Professor, University of California at Berkeley Following the development of basic combinatorial optimization techniques in the 1960s and 1970s, a main open question was to develop a theory of approximation algorithms. In the 1990s, parallel developments in techniques for designing approximation algorithms as well as methods for proving hardness of approximation results have led to a beautiful theory. The need to solve truly large instances of computationally hard problems, such as those arising from the Internet or the human genome project, has also increased interest in this theory. The field is currently very active, with the toolbox of approximation algorithm design techniques getting always richer. It is a pleasure to recommend Vijay Vazirani's well-written and comprehensive book on this important and timely topic. I am sure the reader will find it most useful both as an introduction to approximability as well as a reference to the many aspects of approximation algorithms.

In this state any relaxation in the form of heat and particle currents vanishes. From our measurements we extract the transport coefficients of the QPC and deduce a Lorenz number violating the Wiedemann–Franz law by one order of magnitude, a characteristic persisting even for a wide contact. In contrast, the Seebeck coefficient takes a value close to that expected for a noninteracting Fermi gas and shows a smooth decrease as the atom density close to the QPC is increased beyond the superfluid transition.

Rigorously expanding the Gaussian pair action at low wavenumber and energy proportional to wavenumber, we derive an explicit dispersion equation for the nonzero-temperature complex sound velocity. This equation exhibits a branch cut on the real axis because at \$T{\textbackslash}neq0\$ the phonons are coupled to the fermionic quasiparticle-quasihole excitations. We solve this equation in a nonperturbative way by performing an analytic continuation through the branch cut and find two complex roots at non zero temperature. When the temperature is low enough, one root corresponding to the hydrodynamic first sound dominates: its real and imaginary parts accurately predict the position and width of the phonon peak in the pair field response function. As the temperature increases, both roots become important what leads us to define an effective sound velocity and an effective damping factor to describe the peak in the response function. Close to the critical temperature, the effective sound velocity vanishes as \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{1-T/T\_\{c\}\}\$, like the hydrodynamic second sound. The calculated sound velocity and the inverse quality factor are in quantitative agreement with experimental data.},

	abstract = {We investigate strong-coupling superfluidity in a uniform two-component gas of ultracold Fermi atoms attractively interacting via quasimolecular bosons associated with a Feshbach resonance. This interaction is tunable by the threshold energy 2ν of the Feshbach resonance, becoming large as 2ν is decreased (relative to 2ɛF, where ɛF is the Fermi energy of one component). In recent work, we showed that the enhancement of this tunable pairing interaction naturally leads to the BCS-BEC (Bose-Einstein condensation) crossover, where the character of the superfluid phase transition changes from the BCS type to a BEC of composite bosons consisting of preformed Cooper-pairs and Feshbach-induced molecules. In this paper, we extend our previous work and study both the quasiparticles and the collective dynamics of the superfluid phase below the phase-transition temperature Tc, limiting ourselves to a uniform gas. We show how the superfluid order parameter changes from the Cooper-pair amplitude Δ to the square root of the number of condensed molecules (φm) associated with the Feshbach resonance, as the threshold energy 2ν is lowered. In the intermediate coupling regime, the superfluidity is shown to be characterized by an order parameter consisting of a superposition of Δ and φm. We also discuss the Goldstone mode associated with superfluidity, and show how its character smoothly changes from the Anderson-Bogoliubov phonon in the BCS regime to the Bogoliubov phonon in the BEC regime in the BCS-BEC crossover.

We also show that this Goldstone mode appears as a resonance in the spectrum of the density-density correlation function, which is experimentally accessible.},

	abstract = {We compute the shear viscosity of the unitary Fermi gas above the superfluid transition temperature, using a diagrammatic technique that starts from the exact Kubo formula. The formalism obeys a Ward identity associated with scale invariance which guarantees that the bulk viscosity vanishes identically. For the shear viscosity, vertex corrections and the associated Aslamazov–Larkin contributions are shown to be crucial to reproduce the full Boltzmann equation result in the high-temperature, low fugacity limit. The frequency dependent shear viscosity η(ω) exhibits a Drude-like transport peak and a power-law tail at large frequencies which is proportional to the Tan contact. The weight in the transport peak is given by the equilibrium pressure, in agreement with a sum rule due to Taylor and Randeria. Near the superfluid transition the peak width is of the order of 0.5TF, thus invalidating a quasiparticle description. The ratio η/s between the static shear viscosity and the entropy density exhibits a minimum near the superfluid transition temperature whose value is larger than the string theory bound ℏ/(4πkB) by a factor of about seven.},

It is based on a density functional approach—the so-called superfluid local density approximation. The accuracy of the theory is quantitatively examined by comparing the theoretical predictions with recent experimental measurements for the local dynamic structure factor of a nearly homogeneous unitary Fermi gas at low transferred momentum [S. Hoinka et al., Nat. Phys. 13, 943 (2017)], without any free parameters. We calculate the dynamic structure factor as functions of temperature and transferred momentum, and determine the temperature evolution of the phonon damping rate, by considering the dominant decay process of the phonon mode via scatterings off fermionic quasiparticles. These predictions can be confronted with future Bragg scattering experiments on a unitary Fermi gas near the superfluid transition.},

The critical parameters were also determined at the superfluid transition temperature. These results apply to all strongly interacting fermionic systems, including neutron stars and nuclear matter.},

	abstract = {This article considers recent advances in the investigation of the thermal and magnetic properties of integrable spin ladder models and their applicability to the physics of strong coupling ladder compounds. For this class of compounds the rung coupling J ⊥ is much stronger than the coupling J ∥ along the ladder legs. The ground state properties of the integrable two-leg spin- and the mixed spin- ladder models at zero temperature are analysed by means of the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA). Solving the TBA equations yields exact results for the critical fields and critical behaviour. The thermal and magnetic properties of the models are discussed in terms of the recently introduced High Temperature Expansion (HTE) method, which is reviewed in detail. In the strong coupling region the integrable spin- ladder model exhibits three quantum phases: (i) a gapped phase in the regime , (ii) a fully polarized phase for , and (iii) a Luttinger liquid magnetic phase in the regime H c1{\textless}H{\textless}H c2. The critical behaviour in the vicinity of the critical points H c1 and H c2 is of Pokrovsky-Talapov type. The temperature-dependent thermal and magnetic properties are directly evaluated from the exact free energy expression and compared to known experimental results for the strong coupling ladder compounds (5IAP)2CuBr4· 2H2O, Cu2(C5H12N2)2Cl4, (C5H12N)2CuBr4, BIP-BNO and [Cu2(C2Ø 2)(C10H8N2)2)](NO3)2. Similar analysis of the mixed spin- ladder model reveals a rich phase diagram, with a and a full saturation magnetization plateau within the strong antiferromagnetic rung coupling regime. For weak rung coupling, the fractional magnetization plateau is diminished and a new quantum phase transition occurs. The phase diagram can be directly deduced from the magnetization curve obtained from the exact result derived from the TBA and HTE. The results are applied to the mixed ferrimagnetic ladder compound PNNBNO. The thermodynamics of the spin-orbital model with different single-ion anisotropies is also discussed. For this model single-ion anisotropy can trigger different quantum phase transitions within the spin and orbital degrees of freedom, with magnetization plateaux arising from different spin and orbit Landé g-factors.},

The pure trionic phase existing in the strong coupling regime decreases smoothly with a decrease in this coupling, until the weak limit is reached.

Cold atoms in optical lattices, in particular, represent a paradigmatic system, for which the quantum phase transition between the superfluid and Mott insulator states can be externally induced by tuning the microscopic parameters. In this paper, we describe our approach to study quantum criticality of cesium atoms in a two-dimensional (2D) lattice based on in situ density measurements. Our research agenda involves testing critical scaling of thermodynamic observables and extracting transport properties in the quantum critical regime. We present and discuss experimental progress on both fronts. In particular, the thermodynamic measurement suggests that the equation of state near the critical point follows the predicted scaling law at low temperatures.},

Although this is typically captured by a local order parameter, it has been shown that a broad class of many-body systems possesses a hidden nonlocal order. In the case of bosonic Mott insulators, the ground state properties are governed by quantum fluctuations in the form of correlated particle-hole pairs that lead to the emergence of a nonlocal string order in one dimension. By using high-resolution imaging of low-dimensional quantum gases in an optical lattice, we directly detect these pairs with single-site and single-particle sensitivity and observe string order in the one-dimensional case.},

The approach does away with the need to numerically solve the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz (Yang–Yang) equation. The expression for the equation of state allows the exploration of Tomonaga–Luttinger liquid physics and quantum criticality in an archetypical quantum system. In particular, the low-temperature phase diagram is obtained, along with the scaling functions for the density and compressibility. It has been shown recently by Guan and Ho (arXiv:1010.1301) that such scaling can be used to map out the criticality of ultracold fermionic atoms in experiments. We show here how to map out quantum criticality for Lieb–Liniger bosons. More generally, the polylog function formalism can be applied to a wide range of Bethe ansatz integrable quantum many-body systems which are currently of theoretical and experimental interest, such as strongly interacting multi-component fermions, spinor bosons and mixtures of bosons and fermions.},

We collided two optically dressed neutral atomic Bose-Einstein condensates with equal, and opposite, momenta and observed that the usual s-wave distribution of scattered atoms was altered by the appearance of d- and g-wave contributions. This technique is expected to enable quantum simulation of exotic systems, including those predicted to support Majorana fermions.},

We quantify these momentum width effects, and precisely compute how mirror efficiencies and interferometer phase sensitivities vary as functions of Bragg order and source type. Our results and methodology allow for an efficient optimization of Bragg pulses and the comparison of different atomic sources, and will help in the design of large momentum transfer Bragg mirrors and beamsplitters for use in atom-based inertial sensors.},

We use this framework to show that the operator product determining the number of atoms at the exit ports of the interferometer is a c -number phase factor whose phase is the sum of only two phases: one is due to the acceleration of the phases of the laser pulses and the other one is due to the acceleration of the atom. This formulation brings out most clearly that this interferometer is an accelerometer or a gravimeter. Moreover, we point out that in different representations of quantum mechanics such as the position or the momentum representation the phase shift appears as though it originates from different physical phenomena. Due to this representation dependence conclusions concerning an enhanced accuracy derived in a specific representation are unfounded.},

	abstract = {We present a precision gravimeter based on coherent Bragg diffraction of freely falling cold atoms. Traditionally, atomic gravimeters have used stimulated Raman transitions to separate clouds in momentum space by driving transitions between two internal atomic states. Bragg interferometers utilize only a single internal state, and can therefore be less susceptible to environmental perturbations. Here we show that atoms extracted from a magneto-optical trap using an accelerating optical lattice are a suitable source for a Bragg atom interferometer, allowing efficient beamsplitting and subsequent separation of momentum states for detection. Despite the inherently multi-state nature of atom diffraction, we are able to build a Mach–Zehnder interferometer using Bragg scattering which achieves a sensitivity to the gravitational acceleration of Δ g / g = 2.7 × 10 −9 with an integration time of 1000 s. The device can also be converted to a gravity gradiometer by a simple modification of the light pulse sequence.},

	abstract = {A unified semiclassical treatment of Bragg scattering from Bose-Einstein condensates is presented. The formalism is based on Gross-Pitaevskii equations driven by a classical light field, and leads to a single-component equation incorporating the effects of mean-field nonlinearity and spatial inhomogeneity. Three-dimensional numerical simulations of this equation in cylindrical symmetry are used to investigate Bragg scattering for a number of cases. Scattering from a condensate released from a trap produces characteristic cycling of the atomic momentum, and an analytic description is given using a linear model incorporating spatial non-uniformity. Simple expressions obtained for the momentum packet cycling are shown to accurately describe the full nonlinear behaviour within a well specified validity range and a transition linewidth is derived. For the case of a trapped condensate, a numerical study of momentum spectroscopy is carried out and the shift of the Bragg resonance condition due to mean-field nonlinearity is investigated.},

This limits the sensitivity to acceleration which is theoretically achievable by these configurations for a given frequency of acceleration. We predict and experimentally measure the acceleration-sensitive phase shift of a large-momentum-transfer atom interferometer based upon Bloch oscillations. Using this novel interferometric scheme we demonstrate an improved scaling of sensitivity which will scale as T 3 . This enhanced scaling will allow an increase in achievable sensitivity for any given frequency of an oscillatory acceleration signal, which will be of particular use for inertial and navigational sensors, and proposed gravitational wave detectors. A straightforward extension should allow a T 4 scaling in acceleration sensitivity.},

To the best of our knowledge these are the narrowest linewidth and most broadly tunable external cavity diode lasers reported to date. The improvement in linewidth is attributed to greatly enhanced acoustic isolation allowed by using fiber coupled gain chips and by replacing kinematic mounts with a pair of rotatable wedges for cavity alignment which eliminates acoustic resonances. A detailed description and discussion of techniques used to characterize the frequency noise and linewidths of these lasers is provided.},

While a number of separated wave packets form as observed in the experiment, they do not have a repulsive π phase difference as has been previously inferred. We observe that the inclusion of quantum fluctuations causes soliton dynamics to be predominantly repulsive in one-dimensional (1D) simulations independent of their initial relative phase. However, indicative 3D simulations do not show a similar effect. In contrast, in 3D quantum noise has a negative impact on BSW lifetimes. Finally, we show that condensate oscillations, after the collapse, may serve to deduce three-body recombination rates.},

	abstract = {In an atomic gas near a Feshbach resonance, the energy of two colliding atoms is close to the energy of a bound state, i.e., a molecular state, in a closed channel that is coupled to the incoming open channel. Due to the different spin arrangements of the atoms in the open channel and the atoms in the molecular state, the energy difference between the bound state and the two-atom continuum threshold is experimentally accessible by means of the Zeeman interaction of the atomic spins with a magnetic field. As a result, it is in principle possible to vary the scattering length to any value by tuning the magnetic field. This level of experimental control has opened the road for many beautiful experiments, which recently led to the demonstration of coherence between atoms and molecules. This is achieved by observing coherent oscillations between atoms and molecules, analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations that occur in ordinary two-level systems. We review the many-body theory that describes coherence between atoms and molecules in terms of an effective quantum field theory for Feshbach-resonant interactions. The most important feature of this effective quantum field theory is that it incorporates the two-atom physics of the Feshbach resonance exactly, which turns out to be necessary to fully explain experiments with Bose–Einstein condensed atomic gases.},

	abstract = {Over recent years, exciting developments in the field of ultracold atoms confined in optical lattices have led to numerous theoretical proposals devoted to the quantum simulation of problems e.g. known from condensed matter physics. Many of those ideas demand experimental environments with non-cubic lattice geometries. In this paper, we report on the implementation of a versatile three-beam lattice allowing for the generation of triangular as well as hexagonal optical lattices. As an important step, the superfluid–Mott insulator (SF–MI) quantum phase transition has been observed and investigated in detail in this lattice geometry for the first time. In addition to this, we study the physics of spinor Bose–Einstein condensates (BEC) in the presence of the triangular optical lattice potential, especially spin changing dynamics across the SF–MI transition. Our results suggest that, below the SF–MI phase transition, a well-established mean-field model describes the observed data when renormalizing the spin-dependent interaction. Interestingly, this opens up new perspectives for a lattice-driven tuning of a spin dynamics resonance occurring through the interplay of the quadratic Zeeman effect and spin-dependent interaction. Finally, we discuss further lattice configurations that can be realized with our setup.},

A 84 013618), based on both a perturbative expansion and a Poincaré–Lindstedt analysis of a Gaussian variational approach, as well as a detailed numerical study of a set of ordinary differential equations for variational parameters. By changing the anisotropy of the confining potential, we numerically observe and analytically describe strong nonlinear effects: shifts in the frequencies and mode coupling of collective modes, as well as resonances. Furthermore, we discuss in detail the stability of a Bose–Einstein condensate in the presence of an attractive two-body interaction and a repulsive three-body interaction. In particular, we show that a small repulsive three-body interaction is able to significantly extend the stability region of the condensate.},

We have used this scheme to measure the column density of a magnetically trapped atom cloud and to monitor oscillations of the cloud in real time by making over a hundred non-destructive local density measurements. For measurements using pulses of 10 4 –10 5 photons lasting 10 μs, the precision is limited by statistics of the photons and the photodiode avalanche. We explore the relationship between measurement precision and the unwanted loss of atoms from the trap and introduce a figure of merit that characterizes it. This method can be used to probe the density of a Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC) with minimal disturbance of its phase.},

The condensate fraction first appeared near a temperature of 170 nanokelvin and a number density of 2.5 x 1012 per cubic centimeter and could be preserved for more than 15 seconds. Three primary signatures of Bose-Einstein condensation were seen. (i) On top of a broad thermal velocity distribution, a narrow peak appeared that was centered at zero velocity. (ii) The fraction of the atoms that were in this low-velocity peak increased abruptly as the sample temperature was lowered. (iii) The peak exhibited a nonthermal, anisotropic velocity distribution expected of the minimum-energy quantum state of the magnetic trap in contrast to the isotropic, thermal velocity distribution observed in the broad uncondensed fraction.},

A number of ambitious proposals for precise terrestrial and space based tests of the weak equivalence principle rely on such a system. This implementation utilizes hybrid magnetic-optical trapping to produce spatially overlapped condensates with a repetition rate of 20 s. A horizontal optical waveguide with co-linear Bragg beamsplitters and mirrors is used to simultaneously address both isotopes in the interferometer. We observe a non–linear phase shift on a non-interacting 85 Rb interferometer as a function of interferometer time, T , which we show arises from inter-isotope scattering with the co-incident 85 Rb interferometer. A discussion of implications for future experiments is given.},

	doi = {10.1364/JOSAB.6.002023},
	abstract = {We present two cooling mechanisms that lead to temperatures well below the Doppler limit. These mechanisms are based on laser polarization gradients and work at low laser power when the optical-pumping time between different ground-state sublevels becomes long. There is then a large time lag between the internal atomic response and the atomic motion, which leads to a large cooling force. In the simple case of one-dimensional molasses, we identify two types of polarization gradient that occur when the two counterpropagating waves have either orthogonal linear polarizations or orthogonal circular polarizations. In the first case, the light shifts of the ground-state Zeeman sublevels are spatially modulated, and optical pumping among them leads to dipole forces and to a Sisyphus effect analogous to the one that occurs in stimulated molasses. In the second case (σ\$+\${\textbackslash}textminusσ{\textbackslash}textminus configuration), the cooling mechanism is radically different. Even at very low velocity, atomic motion produces a population difference among ground-state sublevels, which gives rise to unbalanced radiation pressures. From semiclassical optical Bloch equations, we derive for the two cases quantitative expressions for friction coefficients and velocity capture ranges. The friction coefficients are shown in both cases to be independent of the laser power, which produces an equilibrium temperature proportional to the laser power. The lowest achievable temperatures then approach the one-photon recoil energy. We briefly outline a full quantum treatment of such a limit.},

As the temperature is increased from below the superfluid transition to above, the frequency of the mode is always close to the hydrodynamic value, while the damping rate increases. A complete explanation of both the frequency and the damping rate in the normal collisional regime has not been achieved. Our measurements of the damping rate as a function of the energy of the gas are used to estimate an upper bound on the viscosity.

	abstract = {. We extend the theory for laser cooling in a near-resonant optical lattice to include multiple excited hyperfine states. Simulations are performed treating the external degrees of freedom of the atom, i.e., position and momentum, classically, while the internal atomic states are treated quantum mechanically, allowing for arbitrary superpositions. Whereas theoretical treatments including only a single excited hyperfine state predict that the temperature should be a function of lattice depth only, except close to resonance, experiments have shown that the minimum temperature achieved depends also on the detuning from resonance of the lattice light. Our results resolve this discrepancy.},

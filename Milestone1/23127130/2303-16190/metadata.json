    "abstract": "The Good-Bad-Ugly-F model is a system of semi-linear wave equations that mimics the asymptotic form of the Einstein field equations in generalized harmonic gauge with specific constraint damping and suitable gauge source functions. These constraint additions and gauge source functions eliminate logarithmic divergences appearing at the leading order in the asymptotic expansion of the metric components. In this work, as a step towards using compactified hyperboloidal slices in numerical relativity, we evolve this model numerically in spherical symmetry, axisymmetry and full 3d on such hyperboloidal slices. Promising numerical results are found in all cases. Our results show that nonlinear systems of wave equations with the asymptotics of the Einstein field equations in the above form can be reliably captured within hyperboloidal numerical evolution without assuming symmetry.",

    "abstract": "We present and analyze observations of the Type Ib supernova (SN) 2019odp (a.k.a ZTF19abqwtfu) covering epochs within days of the explosion to the nebular phase at 360 d post-explosion. We discuss them in the context of recombination cooling emission for the early excess emission and consider progenitor models based on the nebular phase spectra. Our observations include photometric observations mainly in the optical and low to medium-resolution spectroscopic observations covering the complete observable time-range. We expand on existing methods to derive oxygen mass estimates from nebular phase spectroscopy. Our spectroscopic observations confirm the presence of He in the SN ejecta and we thus (re)classify it as a Type Ib supernova. From the pseudo-bolometric lightcurve we estimate a high ejecta mass $M_\\text{ej} \\sim 4 - 7~M_\\odot$. The high ejecta mass, large nebular [O I]/[Ca II] line flux ratio ($1.2 - 1.9$) and an oxygen mass above $\\gtrapprox 0.5\\, M_\\odot$ point towards a progenitor with pre-explosion mass higher than $18\\,M_\\odot$. The compact nature of the progenitor ($\\lesssim 10\\,R_\\odot$) suggests a Wolf-Rayet (WR) star as progenitor.",

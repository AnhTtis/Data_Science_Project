    "abstract": "Our aim in this paper is obtaining a new geometric construction of equivariant elliptic cohomology in terms of functions over a stack of maps out of the elliptic curve. In this paper we accomplish only the first half of this goal. We introduce a new cohomology theory of stacks, called elliptic Hochschild homology, we prove its fundamental properties, and compute it in interesting classes of examples. We show that the local behaviour of elliptic Hochschild homology of global quotient stacks exactly matches Grojnowski's description of equivariant elliptic cohomology. As a byproduct of our general results, we show that elliptic Hochschild homology recovers equivariant elliptic cohomology in the toric setting. For general varieties an extra step is required. Namely, elliptic Hochschild homology stands in the same relationship to elliptic cohomology as Hochschild homology to de Rham cohomology. In particular, the difference between the two vanishes when passing to the Tate fixed points under a natural action. The general comparison will not be proved in this article, but will appear in the forthcoming companion article.",

abstract = {We develop a new deep potential-range correction (DPRc) machine learning potential for combined quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) simulations of chemical reactions in the condensed phase. The new range correction enables short-ranged QM/MM interactions to be tuned for higher accuracy, and the correction smoothly vanishes within a specified cutoff. We further develop an active learning procedure for robust neural network training. We test the DPRc model and training procedure against a series of six nonenzymatic phosphoryl transfer reactions in solution that are important in mechanistic studies of RNA-cleaving enzymes. Specifically, we apply DPRc corrections to a base QM model and test its ability to reproduce free-energy profiles generated from a target QM model. We perform these comparisons using the MNDO/d and DFTB2 semiempirical models because they differ in the way they treat orbital orthogonalization and electrostatics and produce free-energy profiles which differ significantly from each other, thereby providing us a rigorous stress test for the DPRc model and training procedure. The comparisons show that accurate reproduction of the free-energy profiles requires correction of the QM/MM interactions out to 6 {\AA}. We further find that the model's initial training benefits from generating data from temperature replica exchange simulations and including high-temperature configurations into the fitting procedure, so the resulting models are trained to properly avoid high-energy regions. A single DPRc model was trained to reproduce four different reactions and yielded good agreement with the free-energy profiles made from the target QM/MM simulations. The DPRc model was further demonstrated to be transferable to 2D free-energy surfaces and 1D free-energy profiles that were not explicitly considered in the training. Examination of the computational performance of the DPRc model showed that it was fairly slow when run on CPUs but was sped up almost 100-fold when using NVIDIA V100 GPUs, resulting in almost negligible overhead. The new DPRc model and training procedure provide a potentially powerful new tool for the creation of next-generation QM/MM potentials for a wide spectrum of free-energy applications ranging from drug discovery to enzyme design.},

abstract = {The quantitative prediction of vibrational spectra of chromophore molecules in solution is challenging and numerous methods have been developed. In this work, we present a quantum vibration perturbation (QVP) approach, which is a procedure that combines molecular quantum vibration and molecular dynamics with perturbation theory. In this framework, an initial Newtonian molecular dynamics simulation is performed, followed by a substitution process to embed molecular quantum vibrational wave functions into the trajectory. The instantaneous vibrational frequency shift at each time step is calculated using the Rayleigh¨CSchr{\"{o}}dinger perturbation theory, where the perturbation operator is the difference in the vibrational potential between the reference chromophore and the perturbed chromophore in the environment. Semi-classical statistical mechanics is employed to obtain the spectral lineshape function. We validated our method using HCOOH{\textperiodcentered}nH2O (n = 1¨C2) clusters and HCOOH aqueous solution as examples. The QVP method can be employed for rapid prediction of the vibrational spectrum of a specific mode in solution.},

However, experimental and computational developments over the last 10 years have provided tools which make vibrational spectroscopy a much more powerful technique. This review focuses mostly, though not exclusively, on the use of the amide I mode for the structure analysis of polypeptides. It evaluates the physical basis of a variety of theoretical and experimental concepts and argues that only a combination of different techniques and spectroscopies can advance the field towards a more precise determination of dihedral angles in even highly heterogeneous polypeptides.}

We interpret the data using a theoretical framework devised to separate the roles of structural evolution and excitation transfer in inducing spectral diffusion. The structural dynamics, as reported on by a carbonyl stretch vibration of the surface-bound complex, have a characteristic time of ~150 picoseconds in the absence of solvent, decrease in duration by a factor of three upon addition of chloroform, and decrease another order of magnitude for the bulk solution. Conversely, solvent-complex interactions increase the lifetime of the probed vibration by 160% when solvent is applied to the monolayer.},

	Abstract = {Water-mediated ion transport through functional nanoporous materials depends on the dynamics of water confined within a given nanostructured morphology. Here, we investigate H-bonding dynamics of interfacial water within a "normal" (Type I) lyotropic gyroid phase formed by a gemini dicarboxylate surfactant self-assembly using a combination of 2DIR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations. Experiments and simulations demonstrate that water dynamics in the normal gyroid phase is 1 order of magnitude slower than that in bulk water, due to specific interactions between water, the ionic surfactant headgroups, and counterions. Yet, the dynamics of water in the normal gyroid phase are faster than those of water confined in a reverse spherical micelle of a sulfonate surfactant, given that the water pool in the reverse micelle and the water pore in the gyroid phase have roughly the same diameters. This difference in confined water dynamics likely arises from the significantly reduced curvature-induced frustration at the convex interfaces of the normal gyroid, as compared to the concave interfaces of a reverse spherical micelle. These detailed insights into confined water dynamics may guide the future design of artificial membranes that rapidly transport protons and other ions.},

	abstract = {Fast and accurate simulation of complex chemical systems in environments such as solutions is a long standing challenge in theoretical chemistry. In recent years, machine learning has extended the boundaries of quantum chemistry by providing highly accurate and efficient surrogate models of electronic structure theory, which previously have been out of reach for conventional approaches. Those models have long been restricted to closed molecular systems without accounting for environmental influences, such as external electric and magnetic fields or solvent effects. Here, we introduce the deep neural network FieldSchNet for modeling the interaction of molecules with arbitrary external fields. FieldSchNet offers access to a wealth of molecular response properties, enabling it to simulate a wide range of molecular spectra, such as infrared, Raman and nuclear magnetic resonance. Beyond that, it is able to describe implicit and explicit molecular environments, operating as a polarizable continuum model for solvation or in a quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics setup. We employ FieldSchNet to study the influence of solvent effects on molecular spectra and a Claisen rearrangement reaction. Based on these results, we use FieldSchNet to design an external environment capable of lowering the activation barrier of the rearrangement reaction significantly, demonstrating promising venues for inverse chemical design.},

The ACSFs perform best in modeling the frequency shifts of the OH stretch vibration of water among the types of descriptor functions considered in this paper. However, the differences in performance among these three descriptors are not significant. We also tried a feature selection method called CUR matrix decomposition to assess the importance and leverage of the individual functions in the set of selected descriptor functions. We found that a significant number of those functions included in the set of descriptor functions give redundant information in describing the configuration of the water system. We here show that the predicted vibrational frequency shifts by trained neural networks successfully describe the solvent-solute interaction-induced fluctuations of OH stretch frequencies.},

The method is applied to two model vibrational problems, the two- and three-dimensional H?non??eiles potentials, for which it is found to be much more efficient than the usual DVR and distributed Gaussian basis methods.}

Errors of the Hartree-Fock contributions are effectively removed by including MP2 single excitations into the auxiliary basis set. Using aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets the CCSD(T)-F12 calculations are more accurate and two orders of magnitude faster than standard CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pV5Z calculations.}",

The new sets, denoted cc-pVnZ-F12?(n=D,T,Q), are similar in size and construction to the standard aug-cc-pVnZ and aug-cc-pV(n+d)Z basis sets, but the new sets are shown in the present work to yield much improved convergence toward the complete basis set limit in MP2-F12/3C calculations on several small molecules involving elements of both the first and second row. For molecules containing only first row atoms, the smallest cc-pVDZ-F12 basis set consistently recovers nearly 99\\% of the MP2 valence correlation energy when combined with the MP2-F12/3C method. The convergence with basis set for molecules containing second row atoms is slower, but the new DZ basis set still recovers 97\\%?99\\% of the frozen core MP2 correlation energy. The accuracy of the new basis sets for relative energetics is demonstrated in benchmark calculations on a set of 15 chemical reactions.}",

	abstract = {Abstract MDAnalysis is an object-oriented library for structural and temporal analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories and individual protein structures. It is written in the Python language with some performance-critical code in C. It uses the powerful NumPy package to expose trajectory data as fast and efficient NumPy arrays. It has been tested on systems of millions of particles. Many common file formats of simulation packages including CHARMM, Gromacs, Amber, and NAMD and the Protein Data Bank format can be read and written. Atoms can be selected with a syntax similar to CHARMM's powerful selection commands. MDAnalysis enables both novice and experienced programmers to rapidly write their own analytical tools and access data stored in trajectories in an easily accessible manner that facilitates interactive explorative analysis. MDAnalysis has been tested on and works for most Unix-based platforms such as Linux and Mac OS X.

	abstract = {Protein structure and dynamics can be characterized on the atomistic level with both nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Here, we quantify the ability of the recently presented CHARMM36 (C36) force field (FF) to reproduce various NMR observables using MD simulations. The studied NMR properties include backbone scalar couplings across hydrogen bonds, residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) and relaxation order parameter, as well as scalar couplings, RDCs, and order parameters for side-chain amino- and methyl-containing groups. It is shown that the C36 FF leads to better correlation with experimental data compared to the CHARMM22/CMAP FF and suggest using C36 in protein simulations. Although both CHARMM FFs contains the same nonbond parameters, our results show how the changes in the internal parameters associated with the peptide backbone via CMAP and the ?1 and ?2 dihedral parameters leads to improved treatment of the analyzed nonbond interactions. This highlights the importance of proper treatment of the internal covalent components in modeling nonbond interactions with molecular mechanics FFs. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {We model the solvation-induced vibrational frequency shifts of the amide I and amide II modes of N-methylacetamide in water and the nitrile stretch mode of acetonitrile in water by expressing the frequency shift as a polynomial function expanded by the inverse power of interatomic distances. The coefficients of the polynomial are optimized to minimize the deviation between the predicted frequency shifts and those calculated with quantum chemistry methods. Here, we show that a differential evolution algorithm combined with singular value decomposition is useful to find the optimum set of coefficients of polynomial terms. The differential evolution optimization shows that only a few terms in the polynomial are dominant in the contribution to the vibrational frequency shifts. We anticipate that the present work paves the way for further developing different genetic algorithms and machine learning schemes for their applications to vibrational spectroscopic studies.},

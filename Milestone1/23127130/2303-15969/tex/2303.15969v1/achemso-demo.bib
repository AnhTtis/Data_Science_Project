abstract = {We develop a new deep potential-range correction (DPRc) machine learning potential for combined quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) simulations of chemical reactions in the condensed phase. The new range correction enables short-ranged QM/MM interactions to be tuned for higher accuracy, and the correction smoothly vanishes within a specified cutoff. We further develop an active learning procedure for robust neural network training. We test the DPRc model and training procedure against a series of six nonenzymatic phosphoryl transfer reactions in solution that are important in mechanistic studies of RNA-cleaving enzymes. Specifically, we apply DPRc corrections to a base QM model and test its ability to reproduce free-energy profiles generated from a target QM model. We perform these comparisons using the MNDO/d and DFTB2 semiempirical models because they differ in the way they treat orbital orthogonalization and electrostatics and produce free-energy profiles which differ significantly from each other, thereby providing us a rigorous stress test for the DPRc model and training procedure. The comparisons show that accurate reproduction of the free-energy profiles requires correction of the QM/MM interactions out to 6 {\AA}. We further find that the model's initial training benefits from generating data from temperature replica exchange simulations and including high-temperature configurations into the fitting procedure, so the resulting models are trained to properly avoid high-energy regions. A single DPRc model was trained to reproduce four different reactions and yielded good agreement with the free-energy profiles made from the target QM/MM simulations. The DPRc model was further demonstrated to be transferable to 2D free-energy surfaces and 1D free-energy profiles that were not explicitly considered in the training. Examination of the computational performance of the DPRc model showed that it was fairly slow when run on CPUs but was sped up almost 100-fold when using NVIDIA V100 GPUs, resulting in almost negligible overhead. The new DPRc model and training procedure provide a potentially powerful new tool for the creation of next-generation QM/MM potentials for a wide spectrum of free-energy applications ranging from drug discovery to enzyme design.},

abstract = {The quantitative prediction of vibrational spectra of chromophore molecules in solution is challenging and numerous methods have been developed. In this work, we present a quantum vibration perturbation (QVP) approach, which is a procedure that combines molecular quantum vibration and molecular dynamics with perturbation theory. In this framework, an initial Newtonian molecular dynamics simulation is performed, followed by a substitution process to embed molecular quantum vibrational wave functions into the trajectory. The instantaneous vibrational frequency shift at each time step is calculated using the Rayleigh¨CSchr{\"{o}}dinger perturbation theory, where the perturbation operator is the difference in the vibrational potential between the reference chromophore and the perturbed chromophore in the environment. Semi-classical statistical mechanics is employed to obtain the spectral lineshape function. We validated our method using HCOOH{\textperiodcentered}nH2O (n = 1¨C2) clusters and HCOOH aqueous solution as examples. The QVP method can be employed for rapid prediction of the vibrational spectrum of a specific mode in solution.},

In spite of these efforts it is still considered to be a low-resolution technique, which cannot compete with NMR and X-ray crystallography. However, experimental and computational developments over the last 10 years have provided tools which make vibrational spectroscopy a much more powerful technique. This review focuses mostly, though not exclusively, on the use of the amide I mode for the structure analysis of polypeptides. It evaluates the physical basis of a variety of theoretical and experimental concepts and argues that only a combination of different techniques and spectroscopies can advance the field towards a more precise determination of dihedral angles in even highly heterogeneous polypeptides.}

We interpret the data using a theoretical framework devised to separate the roles of structural evolution and excitation transfer in inducing spectral diffusion. The structural dynamics, as reported on by a carbonyl stretch vibration of the surface-bound complex, have a characteristic time of ~150 picoseconds in the absence of solvent, decrease in duration by a factor of three upon addition of chloroform, and decrease another order of magnitude for the bulk solution. Conversely, solvent-complex interactions increase the lifetime of the probed vibration by 160% when solvent is applied to the monolayer.},

	Abstract = {Water-mediated ion transport through functional nanoporous materials depends on the dynamics of water confined within a given nanostructured morphology. Here, we investigate H-bonding dynamics of interfacial water within a "normal" (Type I) lyotropic gyroid phase formed by a gemini dicarboxylate surfactant self-assembly using a combination of 2DIR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations. Experiments and simulations demonstrate that water dynamics in the normal gyroid phase is 1 order of magnitude slower than that in bulk water, due to specific interactions between water, the ionic surfactant headgroups, and counterions. Yet, the dynamics of water in the normal gyroid phase are faster than those of water confined in a reverse spherical micelle of a sulfonate surfactant, given that the water pool in the reverse micelle and the water pore in the gyroid phase have roughly the same diameters. This difference in confined water dynamics likely arises from the significantly reduced curvature-induced frustration at the convex interfaces of the normal gyroid, as compared to the concave interfaces of a reverse spherical micelle. These detailed insights into confined water dynamics may guide the future design of artificial membranes that rapidly transport protons and other ions.},

	abstract = {Fast and accurate simulation of complex chemical systems in environments such as solutions is a long standing challenge in theoretical chemistry. In recent years, machine learning has extended the boundaries of quantum chemistry by providing highly accurate and efficient surrogate models of electronic structure theory, which previously have been out of reach for conventional approaches. Those models have long been restricted to closed molecular systems without accounting for environmental influences, such as external electric and magnetic fields or solvent effects. Here, we introduce the deep neural network FieldSchNet for modeling the interaction of molecules with arbitrary external fields. FieldSchNet offers access to a wealth of molecular response properties, enabling it to simulate a wide range of molecular spectra, such as infrared, Raman and nuclear magnetic resonance. Beyond that, it is able to describe implicit and explicit molecular environments, operating as a polarizable continuum model for solvation or in a quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics setup. We employ FieldSchNet to study the influence of solvent effects on molecular spectra and a Claisen rearrangement reaction. Based on these results, we use FieldSchNet to design an external environment capable of lowering the activation barrier of the rearrangement reaction significantly, demonstrating promising venues for inverse chemical design.},

The ACSFs perform best in modeling the frequency shifts of the OH stretch vibration of water among the types of descriptor functions considered in this paper. However, the differences in performance among these three descriptors are not significant. We also tried a feature selection method called CUR matrix decomposition to assess the importance and leverage of the individual functions in the set of selected descriptor functions. We found that a significant number of those functions included in the set of descriptor functions give redundant information in describing the configuration of the water system. We here show that the predicted vibrational frequency shifts by trained neural networks successfully describe the solvent-solute interaction-induced fluctuations of OH stretch frequencies.},

abstract = {A new discrete variable representation (DVR) is proposed where the eigenstates of one-dimensional reference Hamiltonians are used to obtain the DVR localized basis functions. The method is applied to two model vibrational problems, the two- and three-dimensional H?non??eiles potentials, for which it is found to be much more efficient than the usual DVR and distributed Gaussian basis methods.}

    "abstract": "Vibrational spectrum simulation, as an ensemble average result, can be very time consuming when using high accuracy methods. Here, we introduce a new machine learning approach based on the range corrected deep potential (DPRc) model to improve computing efficiency. The approach was applied to computing \\ch{C=O} stretching vibrational frequency shifts of formic acid-water solution. DPRc is adapted for frequency shift calculation. The system was divided into ``probe region'' and ``solvent region'' by atom. Three kinds of ``probe region'' were tested: single atom with atomic contribution correction, a single atom, and a single molecule. All data sets were prepared using by Quantum Vibration Perturbation (QVP) approach. The deep potential (DP) model was also adapted for frequency shift calculation for comparison, and different interaction cut-off radii were tested. The single molecule ``probe region'' results show the best accuracy, running roughly ten times faster than regular DP, while reducing the training time by a factor of about four, making it fully applicable in practice. The results show that dropping information of interaction distances between solvent atoms can significantly increase computing and training efficiency while ensuring little loss of accuracy. The protocol is practical, easy to apply, and extendable to calculating other physical quantities.",

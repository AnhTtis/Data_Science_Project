    "abstract": "In 2018, B. V. Rajarama Bhat and T. C. John developed the Williamson's Normal form for strictly positive invertible operators on infinite-dimensional separable real Hilbert spaces and defined symplectic spectrum for these operators. Recently an interlacing relation between the eigenvalues and symplectic eigenvalues for operators with countable spectrum was formulated. We consider two different classes of operators and determine the bounds for the symplectic spectrum using the bounds of the spectrum for some special class of operators. We also compute their symplectic spectrum and Williamson's Normal form. In the course, we define the symplectic equivalence of two operators and show that symplectically equivalent operators will have the same symplectic spectrum. Finally, we illustrate an example of the truncation method using the algorithm we developed.",

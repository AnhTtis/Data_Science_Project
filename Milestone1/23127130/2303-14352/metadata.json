    "abstract": "The spectral form factor (SFF) can probe the eigenvalue statistic at different energy scales as its time variable varies. In closed quantum chaotic systems, the SFF exhibits a universal dip-ramp-plateau behavior, which reflects the spectrum rigidity of the Hamiltonian. In this work, we explore the universal properties of SFF in open quantum systems. We find that in open systems the SFF first decays exponentially, followed by a linear increase at some intermediate time scale, and finally decreases to a saturated plateau value. We derive universal relations between (1) the early-time decay exponent and Lindblad operators; (2) the long-time plateau value and the number of steady states. We also explain the effective field theory perspective of universal behaviors. We verify our theoretical predictions by numerically simulating the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, random matrix theory (RMT), and the Bose-Hubbard model.",

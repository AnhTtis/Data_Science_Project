  abstract      = {The recent discovery of novel charge density wave (CDW) and pair density wave (PDW) in vanadium-based superconductors (SCs) $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A=$ K, Rb, Cs) hints at new correlated and topological quantum states of itinerant electrons on the kagome lattice. Here, we present a physical mechanism behind the remarkable phenomenology of the kagome SCs and a new route toward topological superconductivity. We demonstrate that the $2a_0\times2a_0$ complex CDW state with circulating currents near the van Hove filling is a doped orbital Chern insulator with emergent Chern Fermi surface pockets. The Chern Fermi pockets, of sizes comparable to those detected by quantum oscillations, carry large Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment, and account for the observed intrinsic anomalous Hall effect. Intriguingly, the Chern Fermi pockets are connected by ${\frac{3}{4}} {\bf Q}_\textbf{Bragg}$ in the 3Q directions and produce $\frac{4}{3}a_0 \times \frac{4}{3} a_0$ PDWs as observed in the superconducting and pseudogap phases. The incipient PDW is a never-before-encountered chiral topological superconductor protected by an intertwined uniform superconductivity due to the hexagonal symmetry. A plethora of correlated and topological states emerge, including Potts-nematic, fractional vortices, and macroscopic phase coherent condensate of four- and six-electron bound states. Our findings reveal a new orbital-based mechanism and a prominent kagome materials platform for {\em intrinsic} chiral topological SCs, fractional vortices, and charge-4e and 6e superconductivity.},

  abstract      = {Recently, layered kagome metals AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, and Cs) have emerged as a fertile platform for exploring frustrated geometry, correlations, and topology. Here we demonstrate that AV3Sb5 can crystallize in a mono-layered form, revealing a range of properties that render the system unique by using first-principles and mean-field calculations. Most importantly, the two-dimensional monolayer preserves intrinsically different symmetries from the three-dimensional layered bulk, enforced by stoichiometry. Enrichment of the van Hove singularities, a logarithmic divergence of electronic density of states, consequently appears, leading to a variety of competing instabilities such as doublets of charge density waves and s-and d-wave superconductivity. We show that the competition between orders can be fine-tuned in the monolayer via electron-filling of the van Hove singularities. Thus, our results suggest the monolayer kagome metal AV3Sb5 as a promising platform for designer metallic quantum phases.},

  abstract      = {A hallmark of strongly correlated quantum materials is the rich phase diagram resulting from competing and intertwined phases with nearly degenerate ground state energies. A well-known example is the copper oxides, where a charge density wave (CDW) is ordered well above and strongly coupled to the magnetic order to form spin-charge separated stripes that compete with superconductivity. Recently, such rich phase diagrams have also been revealed in correlated topological materials. In two-dimensional kagome lattice metals consisting of corner-sharing triangles, the geometry of the lattice can produce flat bands with localized electrons, non-trivial topology, chiral magnetic order, superconductivity and CDW order. While CDW has been found in weakly electron correlated nonmagnetic AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs), it has not yet been observed in correlated magnetic ordered kagome lattice metals. Here we report the discovery of CDW within the antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordered phase of kagome lattice FeGe. The CDW in FeGe occurs at wavevectors identical to that of AV3Sb5, enhances the AFM ordered moment, and induces an emergent anomalous Hall effect. Our findings suggest that CDW in FeGe arises from the combination of electron correlations-driven AFM order and van Hove singularities-driven instability possibly associated with a chiral flux phase, in stark contrast to strongly correlated copper oxides and nickelates, where the CDW precedes or accompanies the magnetic order.},

  abstract      = {Kagome materials often host exotic quantum phases, including spin liquids, Chern gap, charge order, and superconductivity. Existing scanning microscopy studies of the kagome charge order have been limited to non-kagome surface layers. Here we tunnel into the kagome lattice of FeGe to uncover features of the charge order. Our spectroscopic imaging identifes a 2x2 charge order in the magnetic kagome lattice, resembling that discovered in kagome superconductors. Spin-mapping across steps of unit-cell-height demonstrates that this charge order emerges from spin-polarized electrons with an antiferromagnetic stacking order. We further uncover the correlation between antiferromagnetism and charge order anisotropy, highlighting the unusual magnetic coupling of the charge order. Finally, we detect a pronounced edge state within the charge order energy gap, which is robust against the irregular shape of the kagome lattice edges. We discuss our results with the theoretically considered topological features of the kagome charge order including orbital magnetism and bulk-boundary correspondence.},

  abstract      = {Charge order in kagome metals is of extensive current interest. Recently, a charge density wave was discovered in the magnetic binary kagome metal FeGe. In analogy to its predecessor, the non-magnetic $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$=K, Cs, Rb), the in-plane ordering occurs at the $M$ point. In contrast, however, the system manifestly shows effects of substantial correlations. Here we identify the topological bands crossing the Fermi energy (E$_F$) in FeGe and characterize the correlation-induced renormalization of these bands. We then derive a charge order from an effective model comprising topological kagome `flat' bands in the presence of a magnetic order. We demonstrate edge states as well as excess out-of-plane magnetic moment associated with the charge order; both are fingerprints of non-trivial band topology and consistent with recent experimental observations. Our results point to FeGe as an ideal platform to realize and elucidate correlated topological physics.},

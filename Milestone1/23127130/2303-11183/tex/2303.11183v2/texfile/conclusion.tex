\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We propose a new orthogonal perspective with respect to existing works to solve DFML problem for exploring underlying data knowledge. Our framework PURER is architecture, dataset and model-scale agnostic, thus working well in various real-world scenarios.
It contains two components: (i) ECI to perform pseudo episode training with an increasing order of difficulty during meta training; (ii) ICFIL to settle the task-distribution shift issue during meta testing. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of PURER.

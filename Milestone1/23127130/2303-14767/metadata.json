    "abstract": "We present a routinized and reliable method to obtain source catalogs from the $\\textit{Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array}$ ($\\textit{NuSTAR}$) extragalactic surveys of the Extended $\\textit{Chandra}$ Deep Field-South (E-CDF-S) and $\\textit{Chandra}$ Deep Field-North (CDF-N). The $\\textit{NuSTAR}$ E-CDF-S survey covers a sky area of $\\approx30'\\times30'$ to a maximum depth of $\\sim$ 230 ks corrected for vignetting in the 3--24 keV band, with a total of 58 sources detected in our E-CDF-S catalog; the $\\textit{NuSTAR}$ CDF-N survey covers a sky area of $\\approx7'\\times10'$ to a maximum depth of $\\sim$ 440 ks corrected for vignetting in the 3--24 keV band, with a total of 42 sources detected in our CDF-N catalog that is produced for the first time. We verify the reliability of our two catalogs by crossmatching them with the relevant catalogs from the $\\textit{Chandra}$ X-ray observatory, and find that the fluxes of our $\\textit{NuSTAR}$ sources are generally consistent with that of their $\\textit{Chandra}$ counterparts. Our two catalogs are produced following the exactly same method and made publicly available, thereby providing a uniform platform that facilitates further studies involving these two fields. Our source-detection method provides a systematic approach for source cataloging in other $\\textit{NuSTAR}$ extragalactic surveys.",

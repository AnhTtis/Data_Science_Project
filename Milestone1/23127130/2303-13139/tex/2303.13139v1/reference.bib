              microstructures in a way that is analogous to ultrasonic
              pulse-echo imaging. OCT has longitudinal and lateral spatial
              resolutions of a few micrometers and can detect reflected signals
              as small as approximately 10(-10) of the incident optical power.

In 0.8-μm-thick, macula-wide sections through the foveola of 18 donors (age range, 40–92 years), 21 layers were measured at 25 locations by a trained observer and validated by a second observer. Tissue volume changes were assessed by comparing total retinal thickness in ex vivo OCT and in sections.    Median tissue shrinkage was 14.5\\% overall and 29\\% in the fovea. Histologic laminar boundaries resembled those in SD-OCT scans, but the shapes of the foveolar OPL and ONL differed. Histologic GCL, IPL, and OPLHenle were thickest at 0.8. to 1, 1.5, and 0.4 mm eccentricity, respectively. ONL was thickest in an inward bulge at the foveal center. At 1 mm eccentricity, GCL, INL, and OPLHenle represented 17.3\\% to 21.1\\%, 18.0\\% to 18.5\\%, and 14.2\\% to 16.6\\% of total retinal thickness, respectively. In donors ≥70 years of age, the RPE and choroid were 17.1\\% and 29.6\\% thinner and OPLHenle was 20.8\\% thicker than in donors \\&lt;70 years.    In this study, the first graphic representation and thickness database of chorioretinal layers in normal macula were generated. Newer OCT systems can separate GCL from IPL and OPLHenle from ONL, with good agreement for the proportion of retinal thickness occupied by OPLHenle in OCT and histology. The thickening of OPLHenle in older eyes may reflect Müller cell hypertrophy associated with rod loss.  }},

It is based on the extended Huygens--Fresnel formulation of beam propagation in a turbulent atmosphere, adapted to the analysis of OCT. Incorporated in the model is a fractal description of the size distribution of scatterers in tissue. We demonstrate its application in the simulation of images of tissue volumes containing high-contrast targets embedded in a mixture of two sizes of particles. The simulated images show the degradation of image quality caused by speckle noise, along with the benefits of employing a light source with a short coherence time and an objective lens with a high numerical aperture. Based on model results, an estimate of the maximum probing depth is given in terms of the design variables of an OCT scanner and the optical properties of the tissue.},

The description is based on the extended Huygens--Fresnel principle, valid in both the single- and multiple-scattering regimes. The so-called shower curtain effect, which manifests itself in a standard OCT system, is an inherent property of the present theory. We demonstrate that the shower curtain effect leads to a strong increase in the heterodyne signal in a standard OCT system. This is in contrast to previous OCT models, where the shower curtain effect was not taken into account. The theoretical analysis is verified by measurements on samples consisting of aqueous suspensions of microspheres. Finally, we discuss the use of our new theoretical model for optimization of the OCT system.},

  abstract = {A Monte Carlo model has been developed for optical coherence tomography (OCT). A geometrical optics implementation of the OCT probe with low-coherence interferometric detection was combined with three-dimensional stochastic Monte Carlo modelling of photon propagation in the homogeneous sample medium. Optical properties of the sample were selected to simulate intralipid and blood, representing moderately ( g = 0.7) and highly ( g = 0.99) anisotropic scattering respectively.  
 For shallow optical depths in simulated intralipid (&lt;3 scattering mean free path (mfp) units), the number of detected backscattered photons followed the extinction-single-backscatter model, and OCT was found to detect only minimally scattered photons. Within this depth range the backscatter positions of detected photons corresponded well with the nominal focus position of the probe. For propagation to deeper positions in intralipid, localization of backscattering was quickly lost due to detection of stray photons, and the number of detected photons remained constant with increasing depth in the non-absorbing medium.  
 For strongly forward-directed scattering in simulated blood, the number of detected photons approached the extinction-single-backscatter model only for very shallow depths (&lt;2 mfp units). However, backscattering positions for detected photons correlated well with the nominal focus position of the probe even for optical depths greater than 40 mfp units.},

The OCT signal is divided into two categories: one is from a target imaging layer in the medium (Class I); the other is from the rest of the medium (Class II). These two classes of signal are very different in their spatial distributions, angular distributions and the numbers of experienced scattering events. Multiply scattered light contributes to the Class I signal as well as the Class II signal. The average number of scattering events increases linearly with the probing depth. The Class II signal decays much more slowly than the Class I signal whose decay constant is close to the total attenuation coefficient of the turbid medium. The effect of the optical properties of the medium on the Class I signal decay is studied.},

Conventional RI reconstruction algorithms are based on weak-scattering approximation, such as the Born or Rytov approximation. Although these linear algorithms are computationally efficient, they are invalid when the fields are strongly distorted by multiple scattering (MS) of specimens. Herein, we propose an approach to reconstruct the RI distributions of MS objects even under weak-scattering approximation using an MS-suppressive operation. The operation converts the distorted fields into MS-suppressed fields, where weak-scattering approximation is applicable. Using this approach, we reconstructed a whole multicellular spheroid and successfully visualized its internal subcellular structures. Our work facilitates the realization of RI tomography of MS specimens and label-free quantitative analysis of 3D multicellular specimens.},

A defining feature of the model is the decoupling of the key functions of an optical coherence tomography system: sample illumination, light-sample interaction and the collection of light scattered by the sample. We show how such a model can be implemented using the finite-difference time-domain method to model light propagation in general samples. The model employs vectorial focussing theory to represent the optical system and, thus, incorporates general illumination beam types and detection optics. To demonstrate its versatility, we model image formation of a stratified medium, a numerical point-spread function phantom and a numerical phantom, based upon a physical three-dimensional structured phantom employed in our laboratory. We show that simulated images compare well with experimental images of a three-dimensional structured phantom. Such a model provides a powerful means to advance all aspects of optical coherence tomography imaging.},

Although this method is useful, the mirror image elimination is not perfect for samples in which regions with high axial motion exist. In this paper, we introduce a new modulation pattern to overcome this mirror image elimination failure. This new modulation is a parabolic phase modulation in the transverse scanning direction, and is applied to the SD-OCT reference beam by an electro-optic modulator. Flow phantom and in vivo experiments demonstrate that for moving structures with large velocities, this parabolic phase modulation technique presents better mirror image elimination than a standard linear phase modulation method. A direct consequence of this enhanced mirror image removal is an improved velocity range obtained with phase-resolved Doppler imaging. Consequently, applying the proposed technique in retinal blood flow measurements may be useful for ophthalmologic diagnosis.},

  abstract = {We propose a non-iterative deconvolution method that can improve the out-of-focus lateral resolution in line-field spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. By using an inverse filter designed from the point spread function of the system, the out-of-focus lateral resolution can be enhanced to a level comparable with the in-focus resolution over the entire axial measurement range. The resolution before and after this deconvolution has been verified experimentally. Furthermore, the method has been applied to the measurement of an ex vivo porcine eye chamber, which has demonstrated that the method was satisfactorily applicable to biomedical applications.},

  abstract  = {A numerical deconvolution method to cancel lateral defocus in Fourier domain optical coherence tomography (FD-OCT) is presented. This method uses a depth-dependent lateral point spread function and some approximations to design a deconvolution filter for the cancellation of lateral defocus. Improved lateral resolutions are theoretically estimated; consequently, the effect of lateral superresolution in this method is derived. The superresolution is experimentally confirmed by a razor blade test, and an intuitive physical interpretation of this effect is presented. The razor blade test also confirms that this method enhances the signal-to-noise ratio of OCT. This method is applied to OCT images of medical samples, in vivo human anterior eye segments, and exhibits its potential to cancel the defocusing of practical OCT images. The validity and restrictions involved in each approximation employed to design the deconvolution filter are discussed. A chromatic and a two-dimensional extensions of this method are also described.},

abstract = {We demonstrate computational multi-directional optical coherence tomography (OCT) to assess the directional property of tissue microstructure. This method is the combination of phase-sensitive volumetric OCT imaging and post-signal processing. The latter comprises of two steps. The first step is an intensity-directional analysis, which determines the dominant en face fiber orientations. The second step is the phase-directional imaging, which reveals the sub-resolution depth-orientation of the microstructure. The feasibility of the method was tested by assessing muscle and tendon samples. Stripe patterns with several sizes were visualized in the phase-directional images. In order to interpret these images, the muscle and tendon structures were numerically modeled, and the phase-directional images were generated from the numerical model. The similarity of the experimental and numerical results suggested that the stripe patterns correspond to the muscle fiber bundle and its crimping.},

abstract = {We present a numerical phase stabilization method for phase-sensitive signal processing of optical coherence tomography (OCT). This method removes the bulk phase error caused by the axial bulk motion of the sample and the environmental perturbation during volumetric acquisition. In this method, the partial derivatives of the phase error are computed along both fast and slow scanning directions, so that the vectorial gradient field of the phase error is given. Then, the phase error is estimated from the vectorial gradient field by a newly developed line integration method; a smart integration path method. The performance of this method was evaluated by analyzing the spatial frequency spectra of en face OCT images, and it objectively shows the significant phase-error-correction ability of the method. The performance was also evaluated by observing computationally refocused en face images of ex vivo tissue samples, and it was found that the image quality was improved by the phase-error correction.},

  abstract = {Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an imaging modality capable of acquiring cross-sectional images of tissue using back-reflected light. Conventional OCT images have a resolution of 10–15 µm, and are thus best suited for visualizing tissue layers and structures. OCT images of collagen (with and without endothelial cells) have no resolvable features and may appear to simply show an exponential decrease in intensity with depth. However, examination of these images reveals that they display a characteristic repetitive structure due to speckle.The purpose of this study is to evaluate the application of statistical and spectral texture analysis techniques for differentiating living and non-living tissue phantoms containing various sizes and distributions of scatterers based on speckle content in OCT images. Statistically significant differences between texture parameters and excellent classification rates were obtained when comparing various endothelial cell concentrations ranging from 0 cells/ml to 25 million cells/ml. Statistically significant results and excellent classification rates were also obtained using various sizes of microspheres with concentrations ranging from 0 microspheres/ml to 500 million microspheres/ml. This study has shown that texture analysis of OCT images may be capable of differentiating tissue phantoms containing various sizes and distributions of scatterers.},

This method involves a combination of Fresnel-diffraction-model-based phase sensitive computational refocusing and Jones-matrix based PS-OCT (JM-OCT). JM-OCT measures four complex OCT images corresponding to four polarization channels. These OCT images are computationally refocused as preserving the mutual phase consistency. This method is validated using a static phantom, postmortem zebrafish, and ex vivo porcine muscle samples. All the samples demonstrated successful computationally-refocused birefringence and degree-of-polarization-uniformity (DOPU) images. We found that defocusing induces polarization artifacts, i.e., incorrectly high birefringence values and low DOPU values, which are substantially mitigated by computational refocusing.},

The system operates with an equivalent A-scan rate of 25 kHz and allows real time imaging of the color encoded Doppler information together with the tissue morphology at a rate of 2--4 tomograms (40{\texttimes}512 pixel) per second. The recording time of a single tomogram (160{\texttimes}512 data points) is only 6,4ms. Despite the high detection speed we achieve a system sensitivity of 86dB using a beam power of 500{\textmu}W at the cornea. The fundus camera allows simultaneous view for selection of the region of interest. We observe bi-directional blood flow and pulsatility of blood velocity in retinal vessels with a Doppler detection bandwidth of 12.5 kHz and a longitudinal velocity sensitivity in tissue of 200{\textmu}m/s.},

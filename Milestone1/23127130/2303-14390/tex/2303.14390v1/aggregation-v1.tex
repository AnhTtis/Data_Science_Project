\begin{abstract}
The paper provides a method to approximate a large-scale finite-valued network by a smaller model called the aggregated simulation, which is a combination of aggregation and (bi-)simulation. First, the algebraic state space representation (ASSR) of a transition system is presented. Under output equivalence, the quotient system is obtained, which is called the simulation of the original transition system. The ASSR of the quotient system is obtained. The aggregated (bi-)simulation is execueted in several steps: a large scale finite-valued network is firstly aggregated into several blocks, each of which is considered as a network where the in-degree nodes and out-degree nodes are considered as the block inputs and block outputs respectively. Then the dynamics of each block is converted into its quotient system, called its simulation. Then the overall network can be approximated by the quotient systems of each blocks, which is called the aggregated simulation. If the simulation of a block is a bi-simulation, the approximation becomes a lossless transformation. Otherwise, the quotient system is only a (non-deterministic) transition system, and it can be replaced by a probabilistic networks. Aggregated simulation can reduce the dimension of the original network, while a tradeoff between computation complexity and approximation error need to be decided.

\section{Introduction}

In recent years networked systems, as one of the most important objects of complex systems,  become a hot topic in overall scientific community.
There are so many networks from high technologies to daily life, such as internet, neural network, logistic network, Boolean network for gen regularity network, networked game, etc.

Among them, finite-valued network is one of the most important networks. The historical origin of finite-valued networks may be tracked to
finite-valued machine such as Turing machine \cite{tur50,yan22,yue21}; coding-decoding in cryptography \cite{ber68,car10,zho21};
mapping and functions over finite sets \cite{bir67,rob86,sch76}; and Boolean networks \cite{che11,hua00,kau69,kau93,kau95}; etc. In the early 1960s
two Robel price winners Jacob and Monod showed that any cell contains a number of regulatory genes that acts as switches, which inspired Kauffman to propose a model, called Boolean network, to formulate genetic regulatory network \cite{wal92}. Since the Boolean network has been successfully applied to biological networks, it caused a enthusiasm in studying Boolean network and Boolean control network.

 A Boolean network is described as a logical system, there was no convenient tool to deal with it, until semi-tensor product (STP) of matrix was used into the investigation. STP converts a logical (control) system into a linear (bilinear) difference system, called the algebraic state space representation (ASSR). Then the classical mathematical tools, such as the matrix theory and the theory of difference equation etc., can be used to analysing and control designing of Boolean networks \cite{che11}.  This approach promotes the investigation of Boolean networks as well as other kind of finite valued networks.

Nowadays, the classes of finite valued networks investigated are various. According to the domain values there are Boolean networks, $k$-valued networks \cite{ada03}, and mix-valued networks \cite{che11}; according to the state transition form, there are deterministic (which means there is at most one successor to each state such as Boolean networks) and non-deterministic (which means a state may have more than one successors such as finite automata), and the transition type maybe conventional (i.e., uniquely determined), probabilistic \cite{shm02}, and stochastic \cite{che13}; according to the algebraic structure of the bearing space, there are Boolean algebra \cite{che12}, finite field \cite{men20}, finite ring \cite{che22}, lattice \cite{jipr}, etc. In addition, several other kinds of networks can be converted into such category, such as finite networked games \cite{che21}, finite valued machines \cite{yan22,yue21}, etc.

All the above mentioned different kinds of finite valued networks have been investigated using STP. Various of analysis and control problems have been discussed, including topological structure \cite{che10}, controllability, observability, disturbance decoupling, decomposition, identification, realization, tracking, and optimal control, etc. We refer to some survey papers for the application of STP to control problems of finite-valued networks \cite{for16,muh16,lu17,li18}.

As depicted in Fig. \ref{Fig.agg.1.2}, to apply STP approach to practical problems there is a bottleneck, that is, the computational complexity.

It is a common phenomenon that a large scale networked system may have nodes $|N|>>1$, but the degrees of nodes (in-degree and out-degree) are very small. Say, it was pointed by Kauffman \cite{kau95} that a genetic regularity network may have over a thousand of nodes but the degrees are always less than $10$. This fact makes an aggregation efficient in reducing the computational complexity.


\section{Transition Systems}

\begin{dfn}\label{d2.1} \cite{bel17} A tuple $T=(X,U,\Sigma,O,h)$ is called a transition system, where
\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] $X$ is the set of states,
\item[(ii)] $U$ is the set of inputs (controls or actions),
\item[(iii)] $\Sigma:X\times U \ra 2^X$ is a transition mapping,
\item[(iv)] $O$ is the observations,
\item[(v)] $h:X\ra O$: observation mapping.
\end{itemize}
If $|\Sigma(x,u)|\leq 1$, $T$ is said to be deterministic.
\end{dfn}



A conventional way to describe a transition system is using a transition graph. We use an example to explain this.

\begin{exa}\label{e2.2} Consider a transition system
$$T=(X,U,\Sigma,O,h),
$$ where
\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] $X=\{x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4\}$,
\item[(ii)] $U=\{u_1,u_2\}$,
\item[(iii)]
$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\Sigma(x_1,u_1)=\{x_2,x_3\}&\Sigma(x_2,u_1)=\{x_2,x_3\}\\
\Sigma(x_2,u_2)=\{x_4\},&\Sigma(x_3,\sigma_2)=\{x_2,x_3\}\\
\Sigma(x_4,\sigma_1)=\{x_2,x_4\},&~\\
\end{array}
$$
\item[(iv)] $O=\{O_1,O_2,O_3\}$,
\item[(v)]
$$
h(x_1)=O_1,\quad h(x_2)=h(x_4)=O_2,\quad h(x_3)=O_3.
$$
\end{itemize}

The system can be described by Figure \ref{Fig.fm.1.1}).

We are only interested in finite transition system. Then similarly to multi-valued logic, a  finite transition system
has its  algebraic state space representation (ASSR).

\begin{prp}\label{p2.3} Consider a transition system $T=(X,U,\Sigma,O,h)$.
Assume ~$|X|=n$, $|U|=m$, $|O|=p$. Using vector form expression $X=\D_n$,  $U=\D_m$, $O=\D_p$, then
the $T$ has its ASSR as follows:
\begin{align}\label{2.1}
\begin{cases}
x(t+1)=Lx(t)u(t),\\
y(t)=Hx(t),\\
\end{cases}
\end{align}
where $L\in {\cal B}_{n\times nm}$ is a Boolean matrix, $H\in {\cal L}_{p\times n}$ is a logical matrix.
\end{prp}

\begin{exa}\label{e2.4} Recall Example \ref{e2.2}.
Set
$$
\begin{array}{ll}
x_i=\d_4^i,& i=1,2,3,4;\\
\sigma_j=\d_2^j,&j=1,2;\\
o_k=\d_3^k,& k=1,2,3.
\end{array}
$$
Then  $T$ has its ASSR as
\begin{align}\label{2.2}
\begin{cases}
x(t+1)=L\sigma(t)x(t),\\
y(t)=Hx(t),
\end{cases}

\section{Quotient Systems and Simulation}

\begin{dfn}\label{d3.1} \cite{bel17} Consider a transition system $T=(X,U,\Sigma,O,h)$. Two states $x_1,x_2\in X$ are said to be observationally equivalent, denoted by $x_1\sim x_2$, if
$$
h(x_1)=h(x_2).
$$
The set of equivalence classes is denoted by $X/\sim$.
\end{dfn}

Let $Z\in X/\sim$ be an equivalent class, $\con(Z)\subset X$ is the set of $x\in Z$,
that is,
$$
\con(Z)=\{x\;|\;x\in Z\}\subset X,
$$
where $\con:X/\sim\ra 2^X$ is called the concretization mapping.

\begin{dfn}\label{d3.2} Consider a transition system $T=(X,U,\Sigma,O,h)$.  $T/\sim :=(X/\sim,U,\Sigma_{\sim},O,h_{\sim})$ is called the quotient system of $T$ under observability equivalence, where
\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] $X/\sim=\{x/\sim\;|\; x\in X\}$ is the set of (observability) equivalence classes.
\item[(ii)] $U$ (original) set of inputs.
\item[(iii)] $\Sigma_{\sim}:X/\sim \times U\ra 2^{X/\sim}$ is defined as follows:
Assume $X_i,X_j\in X/\sim$. $X_j\in \Sigma_{\sim}(X_i,u)$, if and only if, there exist $x_i\in \con(X_i)$, $x_j\in \con(X_j)$ such that
$$
x_j\in \Sigma(x_i,u).
$$
\item[(iv)] $O$ (original) set of observations.
\item[(v)] $h_{\sim}:X/\sim \ra O$ is defined as follows:
$$
h_{\sim}(X_i):=h(x_i),\quad x_i\in \con(X_i).
$$
\end{itemize}
\end{dfn}

\begin{exa}\label{e3.3}
\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] Recall Example \ref{e2.2}, where the transition system $T$ is described by Figure \ref{Fig.fm.1.1}). Under observability equivalence we have
$$
\con(X_1)=\{x_1\},~\con(X_2)=\{x_2,x_4\},~\con(X_3)=\{x_3\}.
$$
Hence, the quotient system  $T/\sim$ is described by Figure \ref{Fig.fm.5.1}.

The ASSR representation of transition systems is  very convenient in analysis and control design of transition systems. In the following we show how to get the ASSR of quotient systems.

\begin{thm}\label{t3.4}
Consider a transition system
\begin{align}\label{3.4}
\begin{cases}
x(t+1)=Lu(t)x(t),\\
y(t)=Hx(t),
\end{cases}
\end{align}
where $x(t)\in {\cal B}^n$, $y(t)={\cal B}^p$ are Boolean vectors, $u(t)\in \D_m$ is the logical vector,
$L\in {\cal B}_{n\times mn}$ is a Boolean matrix, $H\in {\cal L}_{p\times n}$ is a logical matrix.

Then the quotient system is
\begin{align}\label{3.5}
\begin{cases}
X(t+1)=L_qu(t)X(t),\\
y(t)=H_qX(t),
\end{cases}
\end{align}
where $X_i\in X/\sim$ is the equivalence class of $y_i$, $i\in [1,q]$,
\begin{align}\label{3.6}
L_q=H\times_{\cal B} L\times_{\cal B} (I_m\otimes H^T),
\end{align}
where $\times_{{\cal B}}$ is the Boolean product of matrices;
\begin{align}\label{3.7}
H_q=I_p.
\end{align}
\end{thm}

\noindent {\it Proof.}  Since $X_i$ is the equivalence class of $y_i$, that is, $x\in \con(X_i)\Leftrightarrow y(x)=O_i$, then formula (\ref{fm.5.7}) is obvious.

To prove (\ref{3.6}), denote
$$
L_q=[L_q^1,L_q^2,\cdots,L_q^m],
$$
where $L_q^j=L_q\d_m^j$, $j\in[1,m]$. Similarly,  $L$ is divided into
$$
L=[L^1,L^2,\cdots,L^m].
$$

First, note that according to (\ref{3.5}),  $L_q^j$ is the transition matrix of subsets
$(\con(X_1),\con(X_2),\cdots,\con(X_p))$ to subsets $(\con(X_1),\con(X_2),\cdots,\con(X_p))$ when the control $u=\d_m^j$.

Second, according to the structure it is clear that  $\Row_j(H)$ is the index function of $\con(X_j)$, $j\in [1,p]$.

Recall the transition matrix of one set of subsets to another set of subsets (refer to Chapter 4 of Volume 2, or \cite{che18}), it is clear that
when $u=\d_m^j$ the transition matrix of
set of subsets $(\con(X_1),\con(X_2),\cdots,\con(X_p))$ to set of subsets $(\con(X_1),\con(X_2),\cdots,\con(X_p))$ is
$$
H\times_{{\cal B}} L^j \times_{{\cal B}} H^T.
$$
Hence we have
\begin{align}\label{3.7a}
L_q^j=H\times_{{\B}} L^j \times_{{\B}} H^T,\quad j\in [1,m].
\end{align}
Put $m$ equations of (\ref{3.7a}) together yields (\ref{3.6}).
\hfill $\Box$

A transition system without control $U$ is called an autonomous transition system.

\begin{cor}\label{c3.5} Assume $T=(X,\Sigma,O,h)$ is an autonomous transition system with ASSR
\begin{align}\label{3.8}
\begin{cases}
x(t+1)=Mx(t),\\
y(t)=Hx(t).
\end{cases}
\end{align}
Then the quotient system under output equivalence relation is
\begin{align}\label{3.9}
\begin{cases}
X(t+1)=M_qX(t),\\
y(t)=H_qX(t),
\end{cases}
\end{align}
{where}
\begin{align}\label{3.10}
\begin{array}{l}
M_q=H\times_{\B} M \times_{\B} H^T,\\
H_q=I_p.
\end{array}
\end{align}
\end{cor}

Denote the set of output trajectories of $T$ by ${\bf L}_T(x)$. (If $T$ is not determinant the trajectories are not unique.) If $S_0\subset X$, then
$$
{\bf L}_T(S_0)=\bigcup_{x\in S_0} {\bf L}_T(x).
$$

Let  $T$ be a transition system and $T/\sim$ is its quotient system. Then according to the definition it is clear that
\begin{align}\label{3.11}
{\bf L}_T(\con(X_i))\subset {\bf L}_{T/\sim}(X_i).
\end{align}

That is, each output sequence can be produced by its quotient system. Because of this, the quotient system $T/\sim$ is said to be a simulation of the original $T$.

The following simple example shows an output sequence of $T/\sim$ may not be obtained from the original $T$.

Observe a $T$ depicted in Figure \ref{Fig.fm.5.4}.

It is clear that  $\L_{T/\sim}(X_3)= O_3O_1O_2\cdots$ is an output trajectory, which is not an output trajectory of $\L_{T}(\con(X_3))$.

\end{exa}

\begin{dfn}\label{d3.7} \cite{bel17} Consider a transition system $T=(X,U,\Sigma,O,h)$. Assume $x_1\sim x_2$ are (output) equivalence, if for each control $u\in U$ with $x_1'\in \Sigma(x_1,u)$ there exists an $x_2'\in \Sigma(x_2,u)$ such that $x_1'\sim x_2'$, then $x_1\approx x_2$. If for any $x_1\sim x_2$, we have $x_1\approx x_2$, then  $T/\sim$ is called a bi-simulation of $T$, denoted by $T/\approx$.
\end{dfn}

According to Definition \ref{d3.7}, bi-simulation means for all $X_i\in T/\sim$ we have
\begin{align}\label{3.12}
{\bf L}_T(\con(X_i)) = {\bf L}_{T/\approx}(X_i).
\end{align}

The following is an important property of bi-simulation:

\begin{prp}\label{p3.8} \cite{bel17} Consider a transition system $T=(X,U,\Sigma,O,h)$.
\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] If $T/\sim$ is a deterministic system, then $T/\sim=T/\approx$ is a bi-simulation.
\item[(ii)] If $T$ is a deterministic system, that $T/\sim=T/\approx$ is a bi-simulation, if and only if, $T/\sim$ is deterministic.

\item[(ii)] If $(x_i,x_j)\in E$, $x_i\in A$, $x_j\in A^c$, $x_i$ is called a formal output of $A$.
\end{itemize}
$A$ is called an {aggregate-able block} if there does not exist $(x_i,x_j)\in E$ such that $x_i$ is a formal input and $x_j$ is a formal output.
\end{dfn}

\begin{prp}\label{p4.5}
Assume $A\subset N$ is an aggregate-able block with
$\{x_{i_1},\cdots,x_{i_{\a}}\}$ as its block inputs, and $\{\{x_{j_1},\cdots,x_{j_{\b}}\}$ as its block outputs.
Then the dynamic subnetwork of $A$ can be expressed as a controlled network $\Sigma_A$ with block control
$$
v_{\ell}:=x_{i_\ell},\quad \ell\in[1,\a],
$$
and block output
$$
y_{\ell}:=x_{j_{\ell}},\quad \ell\in [1,\b].
$$
Replacing block $A$ in $\Sigma$ by this block control system $\Sigma_A$ does not affect the dynamics of the rest part of $\Sigma$.
\end{prp}

\noindent{\it Proof.} From the construction it is clear that this replacement does not change anything for $N\backslash A$ except changing some variable names.

where $x(t)=\ltimes_{i=1}^6x_i(t)$,

Next, we consider $A=\{x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5\}\subset N$. It is easy to verify that $A$ is an aggregate-able set with

\begin{dfn}\label{d4.7} Consider a networked system $\Sigma$ with its network graph $(N,E)$. Assume $A\subset N$ is an aggregate-able subset, and the aggregated (block control) system is $\Sigma_A$. $A$ is said to be aggregated by its simulation, if $\Sigma_A$ is replaced by its quotient system $\Sigma_A/\sim$.

\begin{rem}\label{r4.9}
\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] From Example \ref{e4.8} one sees that when a block of a networked system is aggregated by simulation its size is reduced. Unfortunately,  the resulting overall system is only a transition system, which may not be determinant.
\item[(ii)] The aggregation by simulation proposed for networked system is also applicable to networked control system with an obvious extension. Precisely, it can be done for each original control $u_s=\d_{m}^s$ separately.
\item[(iii)] For a simulation aggregation of $A\subset N$, if $\Sigma_A/\sim=\Sigma_A/\approx$, the aggregation is called a bi-simulation.

\end{prp}

\noindent{\it Proof.} When $\Sigma_A/\sim$ is a bisimulation of $\Sigma_A$, according to Proposition \ref{p3.8}, $\Sigma_A/\sim$ is deterministic; therefore, the values of input nodes and output nodes characterize the states of $\Sigma_A$ at each time and uniquely determines the input and output at next moment, hence the inner structure of the subnetwork can be neglected.

\section{Aggregated Simulation}


Consider a $k$-valued network $\Sigma$ with its network graph $(N,E)$. Assume a set of sub-nodes $A\subset N$ is an aggregate-able and output decoupled block depicted in Fig. \ref{Fig.5.1}.

\vskip 5mm

\vskip 5mm

Moreover, assume the dynamic equations of $A$ with block inputs $v_1,\cdots,v_{\a}\in N\backslash{A}$ and block outputs $y_1,\cdots,y_{\b}\in A$
is
\begin{align}\label{5.1}
\begin{cases}
z(t+1)=L_Au(t)v(t)z(t),\\
y(t)=H_Az(t).
\end{cases}
\end{align}
Then its quotient system under output equivalence, denoted by $\Sigma_A/\sim$, is
\begin{align}\label{5.2}
y(t+1)=\tilde{L}_Au(t)v(t)y(t),
\end{align}
where $\tilde{L}_A=H_A\times_{{\cal B}} L_A\times (I_{k^{m+\a}}\otimes H^T_A)\in {\cal B}_{k^{\b}\times k^{m+\a+\b}}:={\cal B}_{\xi\times \eta}$, where
$$
\xi:=k^{\b},\quad \eta:=k^{m+\a+\b}.
$$

If $\tilde{L}_A$ is a logical matrix, which means $\Sigma_A/\sim =\Sigma_A/\approx$ is deterministic, then the bisimulation is applicable. That is, the block $A$ can be replaced by $\Sigma_A/\sim$, which does not affect the input-output relationship of the overall network $\Sigma$. In the following assume $\Sigma_A$ is not deterministic.

In the following we propose a method called the aggregation by simulation, which is an approximation by probabilistic networks.

\begin{dfn}\label{d5.1} Given a $k$-valued network $\Sigma$ with network graph $(N,E)$. A subset $A\subset N$ is an aggregate-able and output decoupled block, which is described as above. The aggregation by simulation is defined as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Step 1. Construct the quotient system $\Sigma_A/\sim$.
\item Step 2. Using $\Sigma_A/\sim$ to build a probabilistic network $\Sigma_A^P$ as follows: Set
$$
M_A:=H_AL_A(I_{k^{m+\a}}\otimes H^T_A)=(m_{i,j})\in {\cal M}_{\xi\times \eta}.
$$
Denote
$$
m_j:=\dsum_{i=1}^{\xi}m_{i,j},\quad j\in [1,\eta].
$$
Define a probabilistic system, denoted by $\Sigma_A^P$ as follows:
$$
y(t+1)=M^{i_1,i_2,\cdots,i_{\eta}}u(t)v(t)y(t),\quad i_j\in [1,\xi],\;j\in [1,\eta],
$$
where
$$
M^{i_1,i_2,\cdots,i_{\eta}}=\d_{\xi}[i_1,i_2,\cdots,i_{\eta}],
$$
with probability
$$
p_{i_1,i_2,\cdots,i_{\eta}}=\frac{\prod_{j=1}^\eta m_{i_j,j}}{\prod_{j=1}^\eta m_j}.
$$
\item Step 3. Replace $\Sigma_A$ by $\Sigma_A^P$.
\end{itemize}
\end{dfn}

\begin{exa}\label{e5.2} Recall Example \ref{e4.3} (or, Examples \ref{e4.6} and \ref{e4.8}). Using  Definition \ref{d5.1}, the system $\Sigma_A^P/\sim$ can be calculated as follows:

\begin{align}\label{5.3}
\begin{array}{ccl}
M_A&=&HL_A(I_2\otimes H^T)\\
~&=&\begin{bmatrix}6&6&6&6\\2&2&2&2\end{bmatrix}.
\end{array}
\end{align}

Then the simulation-aggregation is using the following probabilistic network to replace $A$:
\begin{align}\label{5.4}
z(t+1)=L_A^Pv(t)z(t),
\end{align}
where
$$
L_A^P=\begin{bmatrix}
2/3&2/3&2/3&2/3\\
1/3&1/3&1/3&1/3
\end{bmatrix}.
$$

This section considers an example of T-cell receptor kinetics which was originally modeled in \cite{kla06}. The following model is copied from \cite{zhu22} and ignoring nodes' physical meanings.


The dynamics of network of T-cell receptor kinetics with $37$ nodes and $3$ controls, depicted in Fig. \ref{Fig.6.1}, is described in (\ref{6.1}).

It is natural to consider the nodes with zero out-degree as observers. Hence we have
\begin{align}\label{6.2}%{5.6}
\begin{array}{l}
y_1=x_1,\\
y_2=x_5,\\
y_3=x_{22},\\

As depicted in Fig. \ref{Fig.6.1}, the network is divided into 5 blocks. In the following we use simulation to aggregate them.

\begin{itemize}

\item Consider $\Sigma_1$. Rename the variables as follows:
$$
\begin{array}{lll}
z_1=x_4,& z_2=x_{10},& z_3=x_{20},\\
z_4=x_{26},&z_5=x_{35},&z_6=x_{36},\\
z_7=x_{37};&q_1=x_{20},&q_2=x_{37},
\end{array}
$$
where $q_1$, $q_2$ are block outputs.

Then the block dynamics can be expressed as
\begin{align} \label{6.3}%{5.7}
\begin{cases}
z(t+1)=L_1u(t)z(t),\\
q(t)=H_1z(t),
\end{cases}
\end{align}
where
$$
\begin{array}{l}
L_1=\d_{128}[22,86,22,\cdots,120,56,120]\in {\cal L}_{128\times 1024},\\
H_1=\d_4[1,2,1,\cdots,4,3,4]\in  {\cal L}_{4\times 128}.
\end{array}
$$
Since
$$
H_1L_1(I_8\otimes H_1^T):=T^1
=\begin{bmatrix}

This aggregated simulation of the original system has only $11$ state nodes and $3$ controls. Of course, using the transition form of this quotient system, a further simplification can be done by using $y_i$, $i=1,2,3,4,5$ as new nodes. This is a trad-off between computational load and precision of approximation.

\section{Application to Finite Valued Networks}

Consider a large scale $k$-valued network $\Sigma$. Assume $\Sigma/\sim$ is its
aggregated simulation and $\Sigma_P$ is its probabilistic form. According to the construction one sees easily that they satisfy the following relation, which is depicted in Fig. \ref{Fig.7.1}.

\begin{prp}\label{p7.1}
\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] When a $k$-valued (large scale) network $\Sigma$ is approximated by its (aggregated) quotient system, the quotient system is its simulation, denoted by $\Sigma/\sim$.
\item[(ii)] When $\Sigma/\sim$ is approximated by its probabilistic form, $\Sigma_P$, then $(\Sigma/\sim) \approx \Sigma_P$. That is, they are bi-simulated.
\end{itemize}
\end{prp}

Then the relationships (\ref{3.11}) and (\ref{3.12}) imply the following results immediately.

\begin{cor}{ Corollary 7.2}
\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] Consider Input-Output Decoupling:
$$
\mbox{Solvable for}~~ \Sigma_P~~ \Rightarrow ~~\mbox{Solvable for}~~ \Sigma.
$$
\item[(ii)] Consider Disturbance Decoupling:
$$
\mbox{Solvable for}~~ \Sigma_P ~~\Rightarrow~~ \mbox{Solvable for}~~ \Sigma.
$$
\item[(iii)] Consider Realization:
$$
\mbox{Solvable for}~~ \Sigma_P ~~\Rightarrow ~~\mbox{Solvable for}~~ \Sigma.
$$
\end{itemize}
\end{cor}

If $\Sigma \approx \Sigma_P$ (or $\Sigma \approx \Sigma/\sim$) more properties can be obtained.  We refer to \cite{li18b,jia20,li21,li22} for these.

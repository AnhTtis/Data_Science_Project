 abstract = {We present a new method for data-based selection of the bandwidth in kernel density estimation which has excellent properties. It improves on a recent procedure of Park and Marron (which itself is a good method) in various ways. First, the new method has superior theoretical performance; second, it also has a computational advantage; third, the new method has reliably good performance for smooth densities in simulations, performance that is second to none in the existing literature. These methods are based on choosing the bandwidth to (approximately) minimize good quality estimates of the mean integrated squared error. The key to the success of the current procedure is the reintroduction of a non-stochastic term which was previously omitted together with use of the bandwidth to reduce bias in estimation without inflating variance.},

The sensitivity of the procedure is investigated using several probability models which violate the Gaussian assumption.}",

 @unpublished{Phinney_2001, title={A Practical Theorem on Gravitational Wave Backgrounds}, url={http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0108028}, abstractNote={There is an extremely simple relationship between the spectrum of the gravitational wave background produced by a cosmological distribution of discrete gravitational wave sources, the total time-integrated energy spectrum of an individual source, and the present-day comoving number density of remnants. Stated in this way, the background is entirely independent of the cosmology, and only weakly dependent on the evolutionary history of the sources. This relationship allows one easily to compute the amplitude and spectrum of cosmic gravitational wave backgrounds from a broad range of astrophysical sources, and to evaluate the uncertainties therein.}, journal={arXiv [astro-ph]}, author={Phinney, E.

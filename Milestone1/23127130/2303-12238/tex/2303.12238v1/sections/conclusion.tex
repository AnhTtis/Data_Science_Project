\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we introduce two traffic incident impact datasets and give a
definition of incident impact prediction tasks in the context of
spatiotemporal data mining. We design a new
transformer-based impact prediction model, which contains a novel dual-level spatial transformer module and an importance score temporal transformer module to assist in identifying
measurements affected by the incidents. In addition, we evaluated the performance of two conventional models and six deep graph traffic forecasting models on our datasets. The experiments show that DG-Trans outperforms the other models. Moreover, the ablation studies show that the dual-level attention strategy outperforms general attention layers, and the case study shows that the importance score transformer is able to identify incident-relevant sensors.

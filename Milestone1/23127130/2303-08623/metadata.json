    "abstract": "Let $G$ be a profinite group. The coprime commutators $γ_j^*$ and $δ_j^*$ are defined as follows. Every element of $G$ is both a $γ_1^*$-value and a $δ_0^*$-value. For $j\\geq 2$, let $X$ be the set of all elements of $G$ that are powers of $γ_{j-1}^*$-values. An element $a$ is a $γ_j^*$-value if there exist $x\\in X$ and $g\\in G$ such that $a=[x,g]$ and $(|x|,|g|)=1$. For $j\\geq 1$, let $Y$ be the set of all elements of $G$ that are powers of $δ_{j-1}^*$-values. The element $a$ is a $δ_j^*$-value if there exist $x,y\\in Y$ such that $a=[x,y]$ and $(|x|,|y|)=1$. In this paper we establish the following results. A profinite group $G$ is finite-by-pronilpotent if and only if there is $k$ such that the set of $γ_k^*$-values in $G$ has cardinality less than $2^{\\aleph_0}$. A profinite group $G$ is finite-by-(prosoluble of Fitting height at most $k$) if and only if there is $k$ such that the set of $δ_k^*$-values in $G$ has cardinality less than $2^{\\aleph_0}$.",

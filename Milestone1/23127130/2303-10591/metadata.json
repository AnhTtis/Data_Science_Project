    "abstract": "We propose a mutation formula the general rank from a principal component ${\\rm PC}(δ)$ of representations to another one ${\\rm PC}(\\ep)$ for a quiver with potential. We give sufficient conditions for the formula to hold. In particular, the formula holds when any of $δ$ and $\\ep$ is reachable. We discover several related mutation invariants.",
